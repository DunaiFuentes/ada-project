 Griffiths came back to Wolves this season after a highly successful loan spell in Scotland with Hibernian, and was the top scorer in the Scottish Premier League last season. He has continued to score goals this season for the Molineux club, finding the net 12 times to help Wolves to third place in League One.

Local rivals Villa are looking for reinforcements in attack with Libor Kozak guaranteed to miss the rest of the season, and sealing a deal for Griffiths would see manager Paul Lambert return to his former policy of signing promising young players from below the top-flight of English football.

A transfer fee of Â£2m has been mooted for the 23-year-old, who is reportedly keen to move to a club in a higher division. Celtic and Swansea City are also said to be in the running to sign Griffiths, whose contract runs out in the summer of 2015.",0,1390815223,null,0,false,0,cezyg5z,t3_1w9omn,t1_cezyg5z,t3_1w9omn,null,1432126211,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

To get around how variable GP's can be with mental health issues they are now given a mental health questionnaire and they will have you fill this out and depending on the score you get on that it will tell them what is the next appropriate treatment for you actually is.  So if you have problems with them not wanting to do anything ask to fill out that questionnaire as that takes the decision making out of their hands.  Of course if you get a good GP and they are being proactive then you won't need to worry about it but it's handy to know what you need to do if you get a duffer.

Whilst I do disagree with elements of the conservative leadership, I do admire how they've stuck to their principles against a chorus of pantomime politics from those around them (and, it remains fair to be said, within them on occasions).

true,alliecousins,null,null,"* You choose your residence (I'm assuming that's all you're looking into) and rank based on what you're looking for (catered vs. self-catered etc) and then they place you in a room. Most students are placed in single rooms, but there are some exchange students placed in doubles. There is no discrimination/separation based on ages. You also have the option of trying to find a flat off campus from someone who is subletting. These are hard to find (and you won't meet as many people).
* No comment as I'm not in that program, but most 2-4th year courses in ""arts"" courses tend to be 30 units each and each semester totals 60 units. So you would take 2 courses per semester, with a 2hr seminar in each course (on average)... so only 4 hours of class per week-- leaving tons of time for travelling etc
* It's quirky. Live in residence and you will meet people! It has a community feel, but if you're from a school with a lot of spirit, then St. Andrews seems very disconnected and like there is no school spirit at all. You really have to get involved and be a ""joiner"" to meet people. It's a small town as well... 3 streets and that's it. I would suggest coming first semester so you can experience Raisin (wikipedia/google this... it's a huge tradition) and that way all of the orientation stuff is going on at the same time and people are keen to make new friends.  As opposed to a lot of schools, St. Andrews doesn't organize any meet and greets or anything for international students to get to know each other.  They have an At Home and Abroad Society, which I personally think is a joke and would stay away from... but it's worth checking out. 
St. Andrews is also a pay-for school. Nothing is free. You meet friends through societies/clubs, but whereas most other universities have free memberships for clubs/events that don't cost anything (like meeting at a bar for a drink)... all of the societies have member fees and drop in fees... It seems a lot like having to pay for friends initially, but you get used to it
* Social scene is pretty meek. There is one club (the Lizard... it's... a drunken first year bar which upper years go to to get laid) and the student union (under renovation currently). There are always events on at the student union, most you have a cover charge for.  House parties are generally small just because houses are small. No keggers or massive ragers. Sex life is what you make it. Many people like to have it. Some people choose not to. I would suggest reading [The Stand](http://stand.tab.co.uk/category/opinion/) There have been a few articles about sex this school year under the opinion section.
* Canadian here-- everyone just assumes I'm an American until I correct them.  There are so many Americans at St. Andrews (often seemingly more so than the Brits) that people don't judge.

&gt;tl;dr: Because if he doesn't, either he stops playing every week or we stop becoming one of the best sides in Europe

We really need midfield depth and I personally think Gerrard shouldn't be playing every week. He still has a large role to play at the club but expecting him to play at the level he has for over a decade every week is unfair on him to be frank.

Double pivot works alright for us with Lucas &amp; Gerrard because instead of only one man further back to press they now have two which makes it easier for us to play out under pressure. When it's just Gerrard he makes mistakes as we have seen in the last few games. 

The problem for Brendan is the system works better when we have just Lucas as a pivot an Allen &amp; Hendo ahead of him. This is due to their pressing ability, mobility and ability to recycle the ball, these are all issues for Gerrard. He can't drop Gerrard because of status though, it would be interesting to see what would have happened if Lucas hadn't been injured.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt;If Everton did get into Europe then I'd be over the moon, but unless 5 or 6 squad players were brought in (like Tottenham did this year), I would be worried about the impact a European campaign would have on our relatively small, loan-based squad.

People always talk about squad size, but that really is not the biggest stumbling block in Europe, these players are elite sportsmen who have the fitness to play week in week out, just look at Chelsea last season- a lot of their team played over 50 games, some higher than 60 and they finished very strongly (the start of the season was their issue). 

The main problem is that for half the week the manager and coaching staff are taken out of game plan specific coaching and planning. If you are playing in Eastern Europe on Thursday, you leave Wednesday, return Friday- that is 5 coaching sessions missed, 5 training sessions where the team are split and the staff are having to prepare for different things- unless you are amazingly comfortable in your ability to win league games, then it is going to cause a hell of an issue. 

---

For me it seems pretty clear that Europa would kill our league season. We are a tactically based team who don't rely on individual brilliance or a tried and tested approach to strategy every game- we are a side who use different methods and different tactics depending on the opposition. This is why I feel we managed to compete well on both fronts under Moyes, because we set up pretty much exactly the same way regardless of opposition, so gameplan specific coaching was not as much of a necessity. 

That being said, some of my favourite moments as an Everton fan have been our away days in Europe, but the question has to be 'is it worth killing out season for those stories'. For me the answer is no; if it was a single season then I would be fine with it, dropping to a lower mid table place for one year to have some fun prancing around shittier parts of Europe is a fair trade, but with the league as competitive as it is, there is a not so unlikely reality that we may never recover from this and pull an Aston Villa.

---

If there were financial benefits to playing in the Europa then it would be a perfect opportunity to grow the squad and benefit all round from the increased depth. However that really is not the case. The harsh reality is that our starting 11 needs improvement for us to really compete at the top of the league, we have a very good foundation, but it needs bolstering. 

If we were to make it into the Europa, it would pose a number of questions of what to do with our transfer pot, and I feel that depth might take precedence over quality of the starting 11- which is not a positive direction to move in. 

Of course the Champions League is a different story. We could use our normal transfer pot to bring in first 11 players, and the CL pot to add depth (and perhaps another starting 11 bloke)- but that is still an unlikely dream.",0,1390820336,null,0,false,0,cezz6hr,t3_1w9m7m,t1_cezz6hr,t3_1w9m7m,null,1432126582,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

Nobody likes being told what to do, but every teacher has a Head of Department, a Director of Faculty and a Headteacher to answer to. Those who are steadfast in their teaching methods and stubborn to change are going to be forced to in some respects and they might kick up a fuss about it, and I understand teachers like a good moan but that's *not* what this is about.

The forcing through of academy schools through bullying and 'incentives' (a shambolic and detrimental scheme that privatises something that should *never* have profit as a focus); the constant knee-jerk shake-ups with regards to exams and doing away with coursework, and awful decisions regarding exam timetables (English and Maths on the same day, really?!); the culture of fear and intimidation that Gove's cronies have used against school bodies to get their way; the proposed introduction of performance related pay (which if you are involved in education you will know is not feasible and can't possibly work fairly); the blatant favouring of grammar and private schools; the introduction of free schools and their being given free reign to indoctrinate children... I could go on regarding unfair changes to teacher's pay and pensions and how we have due course to moan about those too.

Do you know, unless a teacher works every evening and at weekends, performs like a dancing monkey to - in my partner's case, *fortnightly* - observations and meets constantly changing criteria to be 'ranked' as a good teacher, they are denied pay progression? What kind of working environment is that?

Is it not enough of an indicator that the majority of unions have passed a vote of no confidence in Mr. Gove, some for the first time ever, and one of which being the *National Union of Headteachers*? Do they like to moan without due reason too?

&gt;On issues like this party policy is decided by party conference, and so far those that want a ban have had the winning margin of votes over those like yourself  who would prefer a more nuanced stance.  At any point members can bring policy changes to conference and put them to the vote, so if you were interested in making a change let me know, and I'll help you with the proposal and procedure.

&gt;As policy co-ordiantor I have to maintain a relatively neutral stance, but my personal view is that you raise an interesting point about animal testing  bans about which i am inclined to agree with.

[I was concerned because my friend had DMD in which research relies on testing in rats, but the green party was completely oppossed to any testing on any animals. Unfortunately DMD being what it is, my friend is no longer with us but treatments for DMD are getting closer every day.]

**tl;dr: The green party is democratic. Even if the executive disagrees with anti-science stances, the party policy is dictated by a popular vote of its members. Since it attracts people with strong and absolutist views, these people vote for strong and absolutist policy.**",0,1390823405,null,0,false,0,cezzmg9,t3_1w9nbq,t1_cezzmg9,t1_cezz8qn,null,1432126810,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

It's 11 months old but much of it should, I expect (not checked the numerous links), still stand in its relevancy.  There's been some positive developments to the CFP since then but the reforms (if they materialise) are still years in their phasing and local fishing groups have still called it 'fundamentally flawed'.  There have also been some negative aspects since with regards to trade, or specifically developments in ongoing free trade discussions with the NHS being potentially put at threat through the US deal, and leaks of ACTA being reintroduced through closed doors of CETA, the Canadian-EU proposal.  Since then Iceland, Switzerland, and New Zealand have all stolen an advantage securing early trade deals with China whilst the cumbersome EU-28 struggles to reach a sellable 28+1 state consensus.  The section on EU Federalism has obviously also come on in leaps and bounds in the last 12 months with pro-Federalists in the S&amp;D, ALDE, and EPP, now talking more openly about it.



If you'd like myself or others of a more sceptical persuasion to build on it some more but in a more conducive EU-exit reddit then perhaps repost the question on /r/ukipparty before sounding the arguments elsewhere.  Then, of course, best to make your own mind up.

More than anything though, and this is an expression I've extended to our friends north of the border musing a different referendum; for all people can argue the toss about economics there is for me one trump call.  If it ultimately comes down to a matter of sovereignty and an ability to self-determination, even if it means taking an economic burn (which I personally resolutely don't believe it will), then ultimately for myself a sovereignty/self-determination argument of an Associate Agreement trumps the economic.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I agree there are far more shades of grey that aren't touched on in the regular discourse.

For me, I support the Green Party and am broadly aligned with it's 'heart'. I don't think animals should be used routinely for testing, but I do think testing on rats in as 'humane as possible' settings to prevent more harm and suffering to humans is justifiable.

However the green party official policies are absolute. Here's their policy towards animal testing:

&gt;AR414 **The Green Party would ban all experimentation and research** which harms animals, including harmful procedures used to obtain animal-derived materials. 'Harmful' is defined in this context as 'having the potential to cause pain, suffering, distress, lasting harm or death in animals, except where it is designed to benefit the individual animals concerned

http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ar

There's no real nuance there.

I think for me 'anti-science' would be where you put the ideology first. Other examples:

- Irish religious / US republicans limiting abortion to women

- Anti-Nuclear and Anti Fracking movements

- Denial of global climate change / opposition to 'green' taxes

I believe the healthiest policies *start with the facts* and then you mould the policy to those facts informed by your beliefs. The **fact** is that suffering is inevitable. You can't stop suffering. You can only choose who suffers and by how much. 

The above three examples all prevent some suffering. You save the unborn infant. You prevent environmental damage / potential disaster. You protect the economy from being stifled.

However for each view there is a price that must be paid in suffering. Ban abortion? Some women must suffer. Ban Nuclear and Fracking? People who can't afford energy must suffer. Don't control emissions? Future generations must suffer environmental problems.

It's *hard* to make the right call from the facts. It's really easy to have a belief and then follow that through because it's 'right' without having to account for the cost in suffering that must be made.

**tl;dr: You're right. There is a lot of nuance in all of this. But I would say that yes the green party are anti-science based on their published policies that are ideologically driven rather than fact driven.**",0,1390826033,null,0,false,0,cf001xm,t3_1w9nbq,t1_cf001xm,t1_cezzpfj,null,1432127012,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Yes, you can, easily - most sites will change the default format to docx before they've even started rolling the new Office out.

There are always going to be off documents that have dodgy VB in or something, but that's not the same as a blanket statement. No site I've ever worked at (or heard of) has held off Office 2010 or 2013 because of the format change to docx. I've overseen or been involved with several myself.

&gt;that means you HAVE to splash out of MS Office 2012 (more of OUR money wasted)

Yes, using the most powerful office suite used by the vast majority of businesses (and people) in the world that has been unquestionably dominant for twenty years is a waste of money....righto. Let's not go near defending an eleven-year-old version of an app for the moment, or even include just how fast (and how many times) the cost of that upgrade license per user would be swallowed by training in a different product - again, I haven't been anywhere where any training was even required for Office 2010/ 2013 - how much of OUR money do you think would be wasted getting anyone communicating with your site to convert their office docs into a format your Libre-Office workers can actually open every time they're sent?

&gt;LibreOffice however can open any version, and edit and can save as the format for any version of MSoffice.

It sounds pretty rotten, but the likes of McDonalds and Burger King are almost always hiring. It's hard work for little money, but if you stick it out you have much more chance of getting a job after Uni. Assuming you take Saturdays and Sundays, you'll come out with just over Â£200 a fortnight. This sounds terrible, but in reality it's going to leave you with some spending cash. 

Think about it this way: after 40 weeks you're going to have enough money to pay for your courses in full. Assuming you're taking the course over ~3 years, this gives you an extra Â£11,000 to spend how you see fit. 

Your other options are to take a years apprenticeship, perhaps in IT or in Tech Support, and try getting a job out of it based on your performance. Bear in mind that apprenticeships are paid at roughly Â£100 per week, so you will have to rely on living at home or housing benefit support.

Mine is very simple it won't be that long before almost everything is regulated to the point that you won't be able to do anything without getting a form filled in. At an individual case level it's easy to argue for, of course we want our children to be eating from somewhere that has been certified as safe. (we can leave out arguing the actual benefit, I suspect most regulation is a simple box ticking exercise that only benefits those employed to tick the boxes) At a wider level we are left with a country being handicapped by our own rules and regulations. The sky won't fall down but it will be a life increasingly restrictive and overly burdensome.

As has been shown with all the regulation being thrown out, a lot of it is completely unnecessary yet somewhere someone like you was able to justify it with a logical argument.

It isn't my cup of tea because I'd rather eat what I shoot, but I can absolutely understand the appeal.

Obviously there's no *need*, in the same way that there's no need for fireworks (which kill and maim people every year). But they're safe if used responsibly and people get real enjoyment out of them.

So it is actually quite offensive of the government to say that I am not trustworthy enough or responsible enough to own something.

Consider that there are millions of guns in the UK right now, yet they are hardly ever used in crime. Sawing off a shotgun to make is concealable is easy. And you can easily turn birdshot into slugs or just make your own buckshot. But nobody really does that. I actually think that relaxing the law would cause no significant difference to the UK. Certainly the ban has been shown to cause zero significant difference (apart from restricting freedom).

We aren't America. They have gun culture (which we never did, even before the ban in 1997). They have much more poverty than us. They have gangs and organised crime on a whole different level to us. They have much bigger drug problems than us.

I also disagree with what you say about deadliest weapon. Guns aren't actually that easy to use. If you've ever fired a handgun you'll realise that it's not like it is on 24 or call of duty.

You'd certainly struggle to get a one shot kill without experience and you can forget about multiple shots on target without a long time to re-aim between shots.

&gt;a perceived England-centric nature of the Westminster government is oppressive to Scotland.

oh, it's not a perception, it's quite real, but it's not England in it's entirety, it's a little bit called London and the Southeast, I really don't know how you can't be aware of the favour they hold when it comes to politics.

&gt;(The words ""English Empire"" were uttered by one on Question Time on Thursday), try to blame all of Scotland's woes on England and intimate that once Scotland breaks free from the shackles everything solves itself.

Yeah, Jim Sillars if I recall correctly, well he's wrong on that one though he spoke a lot of sense most of the rest of the time, Scotland fully participated in the Empire and at the time reaped the benefits of it, the contemporary attitude in Scotland towards the Empire is one of disgust, though some people *do* try to distance Scotland from that shameful past, most accept it and use it as a lesson of how low people can sink.

&gt;shows that management of your own affairs is perfectly attainable and workable within the framework of the UK

not management of all affairs though? there is still plenty left within Westminster's competence, the Scottish Government has proven itself an asset to Scotland with every power devolved, I don't see how that could be used as an argument that it has been because it was a part of the UK that this became the case.

&gt;DevoMAX is an inevitability

far from it, no party will give a position on more powers to come, most politicians are simply talking about the possibility that it may happen but the most concrete position we have is by going back a few years and reading the thoughts of people like David Cameron on further devolution where he states that devolution has come as far as it should be allowed to. devomax and further powers are in no way a certainty, in fact, just a few months ago we actually saw Westminster *take back* powers.

&gt;whilst staying a member of a greater British family is a great way to go and can be a happy, healthy relationship

you realise that this is exactly what is being proposed? the entire policy of the SNP towards the rest of the UK is one of close friendship, but the British family isn't quite complete, Ireland (the republic) is left out of the fold all too often, the hope is that a second Independent country on these Islands would provide the starting point for a closer friendship. also this sounds much too like the false dichotomy that choosing Independence means abandoning being British, I'm British, if I vote for Independence and it is achieved I'll still be British, and im sick of narrow-minded people trying to tell me I wont be.

&gt;the date the SNP selected for the referendum to be held

what's wrong with the date? it gave ample time to have an actual debate with time to consider all possibilities, given the ramifications of wither decision I think that's a good thing.

The Scottish Government clearly set out a vision of a Scotland that fulfilled it's role in and a domestic role, they've made it quite clear that they aren't against intervening, just the size of intervention and the unilateral ability to do so is not something they will be looking for, they aren't against intervention, they are against single countries taking the fight for themselves when it should be cooperation of many countries as NATO would suggest.

&gt;fiscal independence but keeping the pound

keeping the pound has historical backing with Ireland but also ensures a smooth transition, in 10 years iScotland could drop the pound for another currency altogether, there's nothing stupid about wanting as smooth a transition as possible.

&gt;the wish for sovereignty but wanting to move towards EU federalisation

Sovereignty isn't the key issue, our voice being heard is, that isn't the same as being sovereign, we recognise that in International politics, particularly with the EU we may be overruled by the majority but we'd at least have the opportunity to voice our concerns.

&gt;like the republican dream until Salmond realising endorsing the monarchy would win more Yes votes

I'm glad you ended on this because you finish with the valid reason for it being done, Salmond wants Independence but by tying Independence to republicanism he makes it difficult to do either and alienates those that only want one, it means that those that want Independence can vote for it and it alone and if in the future Scotland decides to abandon the monarchy then that is an iScotlands prerogative to do so.

This little diversion was triggered by you suggesting dangerousness is a good enough reason to ban something. (At the risk of derailing us further, I'd say the laziness started with you).

I trust we don't need to to mull shotguns too much either? We may have to agree to disagree over other issues, but they are also diversions. 

The handgun ban takes into account the specifics of handguns. They are highly portable and concealable. The type used at Dunblane were not sporting weapons or tools. They were primarily designed to kill people. 

While I accept that weapons of this type are used in some sports I would argue that traditionally a distance is kept between a sport and it's military origins. Hence our shared comfort with archery. 

I can be persuaded that some elements of the ban were extreme, i still feel small bore pistols should be allowed for example. However I am happy that the ban stands. I don't think that people who shoot are odd or dangerous. I do think that their arguments deserve a decent answer.

Well if we have millions of guns already in circulation, criminals could steal them, or they could modify legal guns into illegal ones (like sawing off a shotgun, using homemade ammo etc). And as I said, thousands of tons of drugs come into the country from abroad. Those packages could quite easily contain guns if they were desired by criminals.

&gt;So where's the problem in leaving things be?

It's a matter of personal freedom. Owning a gun doesn't hurt anybody, and it's a little insulting for the government to say that I am not trustworthy or responsible enough to have one. I suppose it's like smoking weed. Maybe you can make some arguments about gateway drugs or public harm, but it's pretty much a personal decision which affects nobody, and the ban simply robs you of personal freedom.

&gt;Source? I was under the impression that there were 1.8 million firearms owners full stop.

One registered owner may have more than one gun. I actually found this source which says there are FOUR million firearms in the UK! (http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-kingdom)

&gt;Number of Privately Owned Firearms
&gt;The estimated total number of guns (both licit and illicit) held by civilians in the United Kingdom is 4,060,0001

1.6m privately owned shotguns and 540,000 privately owned rifles apparently.

Yet less than 40 people were killed by guns last year. That seems pretty damn safe to me!

&gt;...because the criminals have difficulty getting hold of them.

Again, that doesn't really sense. If there are millions of guns around, and the criminals want them, how come they aren't stealing them? Rob a farm, rob a hunting store, rob a gun club. But it very rarely happens. I think criminals in the UK simply aren't bothered about owning a gun. A gun probably wouldn't help their criminal causes very much.

Yeah, so let's allow to train to use them legally so that future or current criminals can learn how to shoot. Nice.

&gt;Within 10ft a knife is WAY more dangerous and you can stab somebody 10 times

You have to get close to that person. You have to have enough strength and good aim. You need to be lucky to stub in good place (a person usually will try to defend). Person in defence can actually take away that weapon from you and use it on you. If you stab someone once/twice it's usually less life threatening than with one shoot, as for example you may not have enough power to put knife deep enough to damage internal organs. A bullet will almost always get inside and even through the body. 

With guns, it's totally different. You spend few moments to learn how to use it. Make few practice sessions and you can kill a person with one shot, from somewhere far, that person not even realising someone wants to kill or injure him.

If guns are not deadliest weapon why aren't there wars with the sole use of guns. Jesus, mate.

And as I said, thousands of tons of drugs come into the country from abroad. Those packages could quite easily contain guns if they were desired by criminals.

This is difficult. You're saying that criminals aren't interested in guns, which is the reason they aren't using them. I'm saying that excellent controls are the reason criminals aren't using guns.

There's no way of proving one or the other. 

&gt;It's a matter of personal freedom. Owning a gun doesn't hurt anybody, and it's a little insulting for the government to say that I am not trustworthy or responsible enough to have one. I suppose it's like smoking weed. Maybe you can make some arguments about gateway drugs or public harm, but it's pretty much a personal decision which affects nobody, and the ban simply robs you of personal freedom.

They're not saying that they specifically do not trust you. They're saying that allowing you to own one is simply not worth the risk.

Owning a gun can certainly harm someone. That's a bizarre statement.

And it's nothing like weed; you can't kill someone with weed.

&gt;One registered owner may have more than one gun.

Yes, but you said owners.

&gt;1.6m privately owned shotguns and 540,000 privately owned rifles apparently. Yet less than 40 people were killed by guns last year. That seems pretty damn safe to me!

Yes. Because those guns are controlled well. In theory they are in the hands of only those who need them.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt; Not only are 1-3 not contradictions of libertarian policy, who are you to say how much they have to identify with all libertarian policy, or for that matter whether it is social libertarian or economic libertarianism they go after, if at all. 

How about a politically-engaged individual who has *actually read up* on libertarian philosophy? Murray Rothbard, Charles Murray, the Austrian School of Thought regarding economics etc. - there is a long history of libertarian thought, and people can't just pick-and-choose it, bastardising it, and claim to adhere to that philosophy, like people do with religion.

The distinct differentiation between social and economic libertarianism, particularly in the modern era, is that the former have adopted the term ""Anarchism"" (because, and I state it again, libertarians call for an **immediate** abolition of national government - that is one major fundamental of their philosophy) and the latter ""Libertarianism"". This has been clear-cut for some time. If anyone identifies as a ""Libertarian"", it's not unreasonable to suggest that they support economically libertarian policies.

&gt; 6 most definitely not disingenuous from a social libertarian perspective that argues that social and welfare provision is a necessity but invariably struggles under an open door immigration policy, as opposed to a controlled immigration policy.

False. Both social and economic libertarians are in absolute favour of freedom of movement, as they see such as an irrevokable liberty. For social libertarians, they go as far as wanting to abolish borders entirely and, for some, even the overthrowal of the entire economic system. They would see any attempt to restrict liberties, as per their philosophy, as an authoritarian action - and that would be objectively correct.

&gt; Seriously, you don't support them, which is fine but you're drawing issues with what policy you think they should be allowed to want to support as if they have to pass your narrow meter for what constitutes libertarian.

I'm simply opposed to people who adopt false labelsto try and associate themselves with certain movements.

true,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"Okay again, my reasoning for keeping guns locked away is because harm is their primary use. Target practice stems from getting better at shooting living things, evidenced by things like moving targets. Yes I know people who undertake such sports are not neessarily a threat, but it isn't them I'm worried about (although, what's to say they won't?)

Bats can cause harm but it's not their main purpose. They were originally designed to injure and kill things, which is not the case with bats, which are used to hit balls on a playing field.

I know those people shotting as part of the sport of target practice are very unlikely to pose a threat, but what reeason do they have to take their guns home? They're only going to shoot on the premises anyway. I'm pretty sure I referenced the British standards article for gun cabinets that stated a determined criminal could break into one meeting said standards in about one minute, but that would be much less the case on a non-residential premises with CCTV, barbed wire etc.

For the guns stats after 1997, they should have never been allowed in the first place. Again, I believe at least some of those guns went into criminals' hands who didn't care about the law, who would then shoot law-abiding citizens who no longer had a gun to level the playing field, so to speak. That spike after their ban could be used to argue this case (criminals could have waited for the heat around missing guns to die down, then use them), but again the data can be used to favour any opinion. You provide data for guns, I provide similar data against it. You say ""why not"" I say ""why bother"". I'm even offering a compromise where pistols are allowed on-site on shooting ranges but that's not good enough either... why isn't that good enough? What good reason is there to take them off-site? As though they will be able to set up better target practicing facilities at home. In my mind if they're a member of such clubs, visiting would be free and membership should be low-cost too.

There's a road near me, a dual-carriageway, that's had no central divide safety barrier for several years. Recently a drunk driver veered across to the other side of the road, and hit an oncoming car, killing everyone in both cars (5 or 6 people). Only after then did they install a barrier. is it out of fear that we asked the council before the ncident for the barrier? Because this is what I'm asking for with guns: prevent them from being used for what they were made for. Why should we wait until a mass-shooting happens before taking action to restrict them (whereby, again, they might fall into the hands of criminals upon their inevitable banning again, yes I agree the lawmakers will take the easy road and that would happen if there was another incident)?

I just can't see any good at all coming from allowing pistols in the UK. I can't see any good coming from the current guns kept by hunters and the like, either. Alternatives are available that don't pose a threat to human life, like certain traps and deterrents for farmers. Isn't hunting also illegal in the UK now?

It seems like we're weighing the threat of guns being used for bad against the good of one particular hobby. Imagine if street racing was a legal hobby but it as fine because you had to be professionally trained to drive in such races, however you could set up a race at any oint, rather than take your car to a track. I mean it would be fine right, because they'd only killt he odd person every few years...

So maybe it is a fear thing but is it invalid? like i said the evidence for or against guns can be used either way. You lined that graph, but then in Australia the case was different. How do we know the same patern will plqay out now, that people trust the government, that patriotism is the same, that mental health is on a similar level... there's just so many variables. So I don't believe we should take the risk. I don't believe we should be taking the risk with the guns we currently allow, as in my eyes they bring no good whatsoever that can't be fulfilled by something else",0,1390833177,null,0,false,0,cf01nxv,t3_1w1kdt,t1_cf01nxv,t1_cezr8zg,null,1432127763,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The time to strengthen was now. This window. It was a real opportunity to make inroads and attempt to cement a top four finish, simultaneously reassuring our top players, Suarez that we can compete in the market for decent players and push for Champions League. After all the Summer debacle with Luis wanting to leave etc, this window provided opportunity to progress.

I have to blame this transfer committee rather than Brendan himself. The courting of Salah, for weeks even months was like watching a satirical bunch of idiots akin to David Brent's The Office. The dilly dallying meant Chelsea snatched our target and now with four days left, teams around us have stolen a march. You just have to look at how quick Chelsea acted over signing Salah. I highly doubt they were perusing him for as long as us, yet they made a bid had it accepted and signed him within a matter of days.

God forbid we miss out on top four, it will be this transfer window and this transfer committee which we will all look back on and blame. There seems to be a lack of aggression and decisiveness within this transfer committee.

true,IRONic__MAN,lfc68,,"Really? I think he's been great most times he's played (apart from when he was left back v Soton and for about 15mins against City when his brain when to mush). He's our only defender who can actually win the ball in the air without swapping shirts with his opponent, he's fast, great tackler and I actually think he's decent positionally considering he has only just come to this league and has had no prior games with our other defenders (you have to remember it takes time to get used to the tempo of the league and to get used to how a new team plays). 

He was slightly out of position against City for that goal (to me it was more about Negredo's clever movement - you cant exepct any defender to stop a team as good as Man City from getting in behind at least once per game!), but Mignolet's error was a lot more glaring, that was a really simple save to make and he fluffed it. Considering we were against the most potent attack in the league and we restricted them to so few chances I'd say he actually had a decent game (bar that bit where he just completely lost it).

I dunno, I think you are missing something personally. You dont seem to be taking into account his age, lack of playing time in this league and lack of time with his new team-mates of whom none are from his country. Also he's actually looked really good when he's played, maybe I just look for other things in defenders.

Yes, you can find individual papers which disagree with perfectly mainstream science.  Even global warming deniers sometimes get past peer-review.  

It might be worth your time looking at the Norwegian documentary, because both sides of the debate are shown.  It seems like a fair-sided program to me.  Interesting stuff.

Fortunately, in the end the truth will win out.  If Cordelia Fine is right, then eventually the scientific community will converge on the result that cognitive gender differences are almost entirely social.  And similarly if Cohen is right.

The end result should be able to read and execute programs written for all three forms of design, being Win, Linux and Mac. Compatibility can also be written for older systems, but later on.

The emphasis for the desktop is based on user choice, rather than a set layout. The option of a taskbar with a start menu is there, as is a dock and menu bar. Other implementations from various linux distributions can also be included, or provided as free DLC. There is also an idea I have had which will allow the user to customise exactly what they have on their desktop, as far as making it look similar to android if they wish. The process must be easy to learn.

It sounds quite far fetched, but I've lost count of the number of Win users I have spoken to who want the interface of Windows with the mouldability of a linux system. Plus, the realm of user software seems to be pointing slightly more at OSX these days.

So far, I have extended designs and I'm working on a bootable system that will be able to demonstrate my proof of concept by performing basic mathematical calculations, and perhaps a few simple commands.

If that *is* the case, why can't we legalise hand guns under the same restrictions that current firearms are placed under? If we can manage to keep at least 2 million shotguns and rifles under control and out of the hands of criminals, having licensed handguns shouldn't be a problem. As we already discussed, you can easily make a shotgun concealable so that's not really a factor that makes handguns worse in any way.

&gt;They're not saying that they specifically do not trust you. They're saying that allowing you to own one is simply not worth the risk.

Those two things are exactly the same. They let me drive a car which has a massive engine, does 150mph and weighs 2 tons. I could easily plow through a pedestrian zone and hurt a load of people if I wanted. Or I could speed, drink drive, or generally be a totally irresponsible moron and accidentally kill someone too. And every year, thousands of people do exactly that, and thousands more are killed by pure bad luck. Yet out of 2 million guns, and 63 million people, we had 38 deaths last year. I think by that basis, cars are way more dangerous. If I can be trusted to drive, I should be trusted to have a gun. And what's more - I *AM* trusted to have a gun. Getting a shotgun license is fairly easy and not uncommon. We've already heard from numerous shotgun owners in this thread. So what the government are actually saying is that it's fine for me to have a shotgun, but not a different type of gun... it doesn't even make sense!

&gt;There's absolutely no reason to have licensed handguns though. It would add nothing of benefit to the UK, it's just a soundbite for the sake of a soundbite, something Farage can point at to say he's tackling the (non-)issues that the other parties are (rightly) ignoring.

You could make the same arguments about the legalisation of cannabis. What does it add to society and why would the UK benefit? You could argue it's introducing a danger we don't need additionally to existing problems and the money and tax made from it is overshadowed by the problems. But again, you can argue about personal choice, the monetary gain and responsibility from legalisation with the somewhat limited risk.

If guns are already heavily regulated and the number of deaths involving legal guns is incredibly small, would it be terrible to introduce hand guns to those that wish to own them providing they pass stringent checks by the police?

You can make thee arguments about alcohol and tobacco as well. The vast sums of money spent on the NHS on providing healthcare, addiction help and deaths is no benefit to society.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt; Okay again, my reasoning for keeping guns locked away is because harm is their primary use.

&gt;Bats can cause harm but it's not their main purpose.

Do you really not see the massive cognitive dissonance you're holding here? How have you possibly concluded that one (the one that's almost never used in crime) has harm as their primary use, yet the other one (that is the 2nd most used weapon in murder and assault) is totally not intended as harm as their primary use? That is not a logical position.

And you understand that when humans first made bats, that harm literally *was* their primary use?

&gt;Target practice stems from getting better at shooting living things, evidenced by things like moving targets.

It's truly not. As someone who goes target and practical shooting (not as much as I used to), at no stage have I ever thought of it as ""getting better at shooting living things"", any more than a baseball player does it to ""get better at hitting heads with a bat"". Can you imagine your reaction if someone honestly told you that's why they thought a cricketer or baseball player plays? That incredulity is my reaction.

&gt;but it isn't them I'm worried about (although, what's to say they won't?)

What's to say they won't? The evidence, pretty much. Gun owners with legally held firearms almost never use them to commit crime. As I said, your fear isn't met out by the evidence.

&gt;I know those people shotting as part of the sport of target practice are very unlikely to pose a threat, but what reeason do they have to take their guns home?

Because they're not a threat. What reason do people have to keep baseball bats and cricket bats at home when, as I've shown, they actually pose a real threat? The fact that you are a-OK with these being kept at home when they are so frequently used in murder and assault, and not legal guns which simply are not, shows this position of yours to not be one that is rational.

&gt;I'm pretty sure I referenced the British standards article for gun cabinets that stated a determined criminal could break into one meeting said standards in about one minute

You didn't reference it. Care to?

&gt;For the guns stats after 1997, they should have never been allowed in the first place.

Why why why why why? They pose *NO* threat to you. Let me make this amply clear: You're simply *scared* of them. No one will hold that against you, but you're arguing that a safe, legal hobby should be banned, not because it's a genuine threat to you or anyone, because you're *scared* of the equipment. That's utterly nonsensical and pretty much the definition of ""nanny-state"".

&gt; Again, I believe at least some of those guns went into criminals' hands who didn't care about the law, who would then shoot law-abiding citizens who no longer had a gun to level the playing field, so to speak.

[citation needed]

&gt;That spike after their ban could be used to argue this case (criminals could have waited for the heat around missing guns to die down, then use them), but again the data can be used to favour any opinion.

That suggestion makes no sense. Considering each individual firearm is registered on the FAC, why would someone hold on to the gun? The police will just knock on their door and say ""Sir, you've got a Browning Hi-Point that you've not handed in"".

Again, I don't want to seem dismissive, but you come across as someone who really doesn't understand how a FAC works, or how the law is framed around legally held firearms if you think this is a reasonable possibility. It just simply wouldn't happen, and you wouldn't suggest it could if you knew how the system works.

&gt;You provide data for guns, I provide similar data against it.

You've not provided any data yet. Please, I'd love to see it...

&gt;You say ""why not"" I say ""why bother"".

Because that's a poor argument. As I said, I can use that exact argument to ban baseball bats and cricket bats, which pose an *actual* threat, and I'd have the actual crime statistics to back me up, whereas you simply don't have any crime statistics relating to legally held firearms, which pose *no* threat.

&gt;I'm even offering a compromise where pistols are allowed on-site on shooting ranges but that's not good enough either... why isn't that good enough?

Because you've tried to propose a solution to a problem that simply doesn't exist, and called it a ""compromise"". That's not how a compromise works.

&gt;is it out of fear that we asked the council before the ncident for the barrier?

No, because over 1,700 people died on the roads in the UK, so it's an evidenced concern. How many people were murdered with legally held guns in the UK last year? If you wanted to have a better comparison, it'd be like petitioning your council for a tiger-proof fence around your local primary school, especially as tigers in the UK pose as much of a threat to the public as legally held guns do.

&gt;Because this is what I'm asking for with guns: prevent them from being used for what they were made for. 

And yet, with the current set-up (guns kept in safes at home), the killings you so fear simply don't happen. As I've said before, you're trying to solve a problem that *doesn't exist*.

&gt;whereby, again, they might fall into the hands of criminals upon their inevitable banning again

Again, if you think this is a likely scenario, you simply don't understand how the law works.

&gt;I just can't see any good at all coming from allowing pistols in the UK.

What, except for the jobs and revenue they would bring? And as we've shown, legally held ones pose zero reasonable threat to you, and banning them didn't make you any safer at all. You're basing your argument in fear, not reason.

&gt;Isn't hunting also illegal in the UK now?

No.

&gt;It seems like we're weighing the threat of guns being used for bad against the good of one particular hobby.

I don't know how else I can say this! THERE IS NO THREAT TO THEM BEING USED FOR BAD!

&gt;So maybe it is a fear thing but is it invalid?

If it's fear-based, and the evidence is against you, it's totally invalid.

&gt; like i said the evidence for or against guns can be used either way.

Utter nonsense. It can only ""go either way"" if you purposefully ignore any evidence that's inconvenient to your argument, known as ""confirmation bias"".

&gt;I don't believe we should be taking the risk with the guns we currently allow, as in my eyes they bring no good whatsoever that can't be fulfilled by something else

Let me explain how this sounds to me: You know those Daily-Mail types who are convinced that computer games will turn people into psychopaths, and demand they're banned? You know, how GTA5 is apparently ""training"" people to murder prostitutes? Or those people who, 20 years ago, demanded rock music be banned because it was satanic or convincing people to murder?

That's how you are sounding right now. Like them, your argument is based around the fear of something you don't understand. You seem to be ignoring all the evidence against your position, yet taking a view that is similar to ""WON'T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN"". You cannot provide any evidence to suggest legal guns are a problem, and I've shown you that they are literally not a problem, yet you still want them banned because they scare you. You can't *seriously* think that's a reasoned position to take, right?

If you don't like them, if they scare you, then simply don't participate in the sport. Don't, however, try and ban them because they scare you (despite posing none of the threats you claim).

Ban smoking first. That's something which doesn't need to exist, serves absolutely zero purpose and can also harm others.

Ban alcohol next. Again, it's not a necessity and it causes massive social problems.

Ban cars next. Ok, maybe they're more useful, but if lives saved is the top priority then this makes a significant dent.

That would save at least 200,000 lives a year.

And ok, let's think out of those 38 deaths, how many would have occurred if a gun wasn't available. It definitely wouldn't be 0. If you want someone dead, you can stab them or 100 other ways to kill them.

It's not ignorant to look at facts and statistics, or the numerous civilised countries with legal handguns, or the UK pre 1997. If I'm honest, I think I have been the more reasonable person here - quoting and sourcing statistics and facts, while you can basically only say ""I don't like guns and they're scary and therefore nobody should have them.""

The really funny thing is that the ban is so recent (1997). It's not like we would be reversing a particularly long trend. Are you old enough to remember the 80's or 90's? There weren't gangland shootings and robberies every two minutes. And many civilised countries still have legal handguns, such as New Zealand. The UK would not revert to the wild west in the event of relaxing the laws. We would legalise handguns in the same manner as shotguns and rifles - with appropriate licensing. If there are as many as 4 million firearms in private ownership in the UK, and only 38 murders, the licensing and control clearly works well.

I'm not going to reply properly to your other ranting comment because I think I am being quite reasonable. And fwiw, I'm British born and bred ;)",1,1390836747,null,0,false,0,cf02uft,t3_1w9vfd,t1_cf02uft,t1_cf01h2n,null,1432128278,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Most gun shots aren't fatal. And being stabbed is JUST as likely to kill you as being shot - especially by a handgun which is LESS powerful than the shotguns or rifles that are already legal and widely owned in the UK.

I just honestly get the feeling that you are irrationally scared. Especially with your waffle about the kids finding the key and shooting someone or themselves. The kids could also access the kitchen knives, the tools in the garage, the oven, the hob or many other dangerous household items which would certainly be less secured than a firearm.

Let's also assume Barry stays, and Deulofeu is allowed to go out on loan again from Barca (biggest if in my mind, but lets run with it). 

If that's the case, I think we're 2 deep at every position, and 2 deep with decent quality. 

Jags/Distin as first choice centre backs, with Stones/Alcaraz as second choice.

Coleman/Hibbert at RB, Baines/Oviedo at LB

Barry/McCarthy/Gibson/Osman as central defensive midfielders

Barkley/Osman/Mirallas as central attacking midfielders.

Pienaar/Oviedo on the left wing, Mirallas/McGeady/Deulofeu/Naismith on the right wing.

Kone/Vellios/Mirallas up top.

The only glaring weaknesses I see is Osman's need to start some games, and our dearth of quality strikers. I think we get 2 strikers in the summer on a permanent basis, so that's that problem sorted. Plus, Naismith and Mirallas are flexible and have shown that they can play on the right or through the middle. And who knows, we have 9 outfield players out on loan right now, many of them getting serious minutes. Who would have thought this time last year that Ross would be so massive for us, it's very possible that 1 if not 2 of those players are ready to play next year, against European minnows if not PL sides.

So about Â£25M this window can easily secure a return on the investment by the end of the season if we lock in 4th or better.

You know exactly what I'm trying to say. I'm saying that gun crime is SO insignificant that focusing on it or worrying about it is ridiculous. If you are concerned with saving lives, we can focus on many other things before thinking about gun legislation.


&gt;Do you not understand that you're looking at the numbers completely the wrong way round?
That figure of 38 is low because we have gun control.

This is absolutely untrue. The figures BEFORE the ban were the same. They have never been high. Last year the rate of gun murder in the UK was 0.06/100,000 people. In 1995, the year before the ban, it was 0.07/100,000

(http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/england-and-wales)

So really the ban has accomplished... nothing. No statistical decrease, or increase, in gun deaths. A completely ineffectual law.

This is what I'm saying. The UK has never had a ""gun problem"", nor would we have one if we relaxed the rules.

&gt;And yet another crass and vile statement.

It is neither crass, nor vile. We live in a country of 60 million people. Some of them are going to die, whether by bad luck, preventable causes, accident, stupidity or crime. That is just a fact of life. The fact that ONLY 38 people were shot dead last year is incredible, and a testament to the fact that the UK is extremely safe. An increase to 100 people is statistically insignificant in a population that big. And as I pointed out earlier, if you want to save 100 lives it would be far more effective to restrict smoking, drinking or driving.

However, I have shown you comprehensively that the gun ban or lack of access to guns is simply not a factor in this low gun murder rate.

I simply can't understand the logic of you saying that re-introducing handguns would be bad for the UK. On one hand you accept that there are many firearms here already, but a low crime rate. You already accept that our licensing and regulation system is very robust (and you said yourself that it keeps guns away from criminals). But for some reason you feel that adding handguns would suddenly be terrible?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You know exactly what I'm trying to say. I'm saying that gun crime is SO insignificant that focusing on it or worrying about it is ridiculous. If you are concerned with saving lives, we can focus on many other things before thinking about gun legislation.

But the legislation is *already* there. You don't know how many crimes are being prevented, because they're being prevented.

&gt;So really the ban has accomplished... nothing. No statistical decrease, or increase, in gun deaths. A completely ineffectual law.

But you don't *know* this do you? You don't know that gun homicides wouldn't have gone up without gun control.

This is what I'm trying to get across to you. The fact that gun crimes have not changed is not a reason to re-introduce handguns.

Guns serve no valuable purpose, so there's simply no reason to reintroduce them. There's not a massive amount of effort needed to keep them out.

&gt;It is neither crass, nor vile. We live in a country of 60 million people. Some of them are going to die, whether by bad luck, preventable causes, accident, stupidity or crime. That is just a fact of life. The fact that ONLY 38 people were shot dead last year is incredible, and a testament to the fact that the UK is extremely safe. An increase to 100 people is statistically insignificant in a population that big. And as I pointed out earlier, if you want to save 100 lives it would be far more effective to restrict smoking, drinking or driving.

If one life is saved by banning guns, where's the problem? We already do restrict smoking, drinking and driving.

&gt;However, I have shown you comprehensively that the gun ban or lack of access to guns is simply not a factor in this low gun murder rate.

We clearly have very differing ideas of what constitutes *comprehensive*.

&gt;I simply can't understand the logic of you saying that re-introducing handguns would be bad for the UK. On one hand you accept that there are many firearms here already, but a low crime rate. You already accept that our licensing and regulation system is very robust (and you said yourself that it keeps guns away from criminals). But for some reason you feel that adding handguns would suddenly be terrible? Even if introduced under the same legislation and licensing schemes as rifles?

Erm, no, I'm simply saying that the risk outweighs the benefits. We don't know that things will get worse, but they certainly aren't going to get better.

true,gomez12,null,null,"&gt;Do you expect that figure to go up, go down or stay the same with an increase in the numbers and availability of small easily concealable firearms?

That's a very good question. Let's look at some figures. (http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/england-and-wales)

In 1995, before the handgun ban, there were 26 gun homicides. That's 0.06 deaths per 100,000 people.

In 2011, there were 31 gun homicides. That's actually a slightly higher (though statistically the same) rate of 0.07 deaths per 100,000

So, what conclusion can we draw from this? If restricting handguns made no difference to gun murders, I can't see that UN-restricting them would make any difference either.

If you look at all of the years between 1995 and 2011, you see the rate is more or less constant, with occasional ups and downs. It really hasn't changed at all, especially not in response to legislation.

&gt;In order for you to indulge in your gun hobby, what would you consider an acceptable increase in criminal firearms use and fatalities?

I see what you are trying to do, but I don't think that's a fair question. All freedoms have some sort of cost. I'm sure you indulge in occasional sensible drinking, yet tens of thousands of people die from alcohol every year. And almost 50% of ALL crime (including rapes and murders) involve booze too. 

So could I fairly ask the question of ""In order to indulge recreational drinking, do you consider 100,000 deaths, 100's of rapes etc etc etc to be acceptable?"" If you want to ban guns because of the greater good and *potential* harm to society, you should also want to ban everything else that have been *proven* to cause FAR more harm to society than guns ever have. But I would guess that you DO accept a certain amount of abuse as ok in return for the freedom of enjoying a pint?

&gt;You talk about personal freedoms, well in a civilised society those freedoms have limits. That limit is when your freedom unreasonably infringes upon the freedom of others.

I entirely agree. Which is why handguns could be legalised but restricted in the same way as shotguns or rifles.

No.

&gt;Will not signing anyone this January mean we will fall short of top four?

Yes, and it'll be to *Manchester Fucking United*. Kill me now.

&gt;What are your thoughts? Can we do it?

This may sound hyperbolic, but I think that if we don't at least sign a CDM this window, it may be looked upon in 10 or 20 years as the move that sealed Liverpool's fate as a mid-table club.

This season, a lot of the traditional top teams are in a state of flux, which has put top four in closer reach than ever. United, who has quite a lot more money than us, has had an awful first half of the season but the signing of Juan Mata is likely to reignite them as a serious challenger.

(I say this in part because he's great but also because it's a psychological boost for them, and I think a big part of their problem has been the psychological pressure. Now something great has happened for them, Moyes has earned a little bit of the fans' trust, and it could easily snowball.) 

This will probably not be the case again for a while, and if we miss top four this season, we're likely to get locked out. The longer we go without CL football, the longer we'll go without CL-caliber players. Luis Suarez will leave and we'll be unlikely to find and keep a talent like that again anytime soon. And of course City, Chelsea, United, and Arsenal (I think) all have a financial advantage over us already. Every season we miss CL, that gets worse.

If United improves the way I suspect they're going to, I really think this is a make-or-break moment for us...and if we miss the chance this year, we may not get a chance again for quite a while, either until one of the billionaires fucks off at City or Chelsea, or until we get purchased by our own crazy billionaire or something.

In general I like FSG's policy of buying young and not wasting money.

This is what I'm trying to get across to you. The fact that gun crimes have not changed is not a reason to re-introduce handguns.

Sorry, are you trying to get me to prove a negative? You're trying to say that things would have been worse without the ban, but you have absolutely no evidence at all to support that idea.

You are giving the exact same example that Lisa gave when she sells Homer the rock that keeps away tigers.

I presented some figures, several years of gun death rates and other stats throughout my posts here. You have presented gut feelings and some unsubstantiated ""what ifs"".

This is an EXTREMELY selfish point of view. Just because YOU don't like guns and don't appreciate them as a hobby doesn't mean they should be banned.  Especially the ""if ONE life..."" statement. If somebody told you that you can't play computer games or use reddit (or any other ""little hobby you have"") any more because someone might die, you wouldn't find that acceptable.

1. Man U, Everton managerial changes/Spurs midseason change
2. Spurs lose Bale and try to integrate a bunch of new players and therefore struggle at the start of the year.
3. No Europa league for us. We can really focus on the Prem and we have played less games than both Man U and Spurs.
4. SAS playing out of their minds and while I'm loving it can they really keep it up. It's a crazy pace they are both on.

I really don't want to be that guy that is being super pessimistic but I feel like we have had a lot of things go our way with regards to the teams around us.

Now we have had pretty bad luck with injuries, but for how things have gone for the clubs around us it's been good.

I think this is why I've been so disappointed we aren't going for it more. It really seems like the perfect time to do it. I don't want to see the squad Man U have next year after they spend that what reported 200 million they have for the summer.

If, on the other hand, you've used subsidy to kickstart a private local economy, then your hope is that it becomes self-sustaining.  Withdrawing money then doesn't do that same level of damage.

It's the difference between ""good"" taxes and ""bad"" taxes.  A ""bad"" tax kills businesses (VAT for example), a ""good"" tax doesn't (corporation tax).  For a given revenue then, it's better to collect it with the good tax.

* Towns are small and people move away, so to see my friends I need good public transport or use my own.


* For a young person like me, even with 2 years no claims my insurance is Â£90 a month and petrol is a huge cost as I need to commute to work. Commuting to work in a car is typical if you work outside of London.


* Public transport is very (very) bad compared to Londons and is really expensive anyway. 



So, if transport was less of a bitch I might be tempted to stick around in my own town rather than flee to London. For a young person cars are a massive skip to throw money (we don't have) into. I love driving but I hate owning a car - and even as simple as getting to a town up the next junction unless it's on a mutual rail line (originating from London) we're talking *double* the commute time at the least.

That's enough bodies to cover 3 positions by any stretch.  We need a player or two in this area very, very badly.  Particularly a holding/defensive minded one as there's only 1 Lucas in the squad and none of the other CMs can really play his position properly.  Allen maybe, he did quite well there at the start of last season before Lucas came back, but IMO a more natural DM would be a better option than him.

We got to 4th because we didn't have these injury problems (aside from Enrique and Johnson) staring down at us, and we were really lucky to go the entire first half of the season without getting exposed.  Now we're getting hit with injuries and we very clearly don't have the players to compensate for that.  We need to solve that problem immediately or we'll most likely start to slide downwards at least a little bit.

As one more example, consider like internet filtering. This subreddit is very heavily against opt-out filtering where you have to ask for something to be unblocked. But what we have with guns is mandatory filtering, and you can't even ask for it to be unblocked. But I'm sure that people here would say that the internet should be free by default - the bad stuff included. And now you're asking me why I don't want that with guns or any other aspect of person freedom. It's the exact same argument. Couldn't I ask the same thing about the internet filtering - why do you WANT porn to be un-blocked when kids could see it, or people could get addicted? Yet I would also never want to filter porn because again it's a matter of freedom.

But ok, you asked me to be specific to guns rather than only the principles behind it. Aside from the main benefit of freedom, guns are a good hobby. They're nice to collect. They are good technology which is very interesting and mechanical. There are all sorts of accessories and customisations which are interesting and exciting. Plus, they are a lot of fun to shoot, fun to challenge yourself with, and like all good hobbies, you can practice, improve, upgrade equipment and keep trying new things. And yes, potentially they could be useful in self-defence. Though if we are going to down the road of making handguns equal to shotguns, that's an argument for a different day since you can't own any firearms for self defence right now.

The way I see it is this - label yourself however you want. If you are 70-80-90% towards men (as a guy) then it's safe to say you aren't going to enter a relationship with a female, so it's probably fair enough to say that you are ""gay"" in the sense of you will never have a hetero relationship. Equally if you're 70-80-90% attracted to women as a man then it's safe to presume you're ""straight"".

I'm attracted to both sexes (and not in that emofag way, nor the ""i'm drunk let me kiss my mates"" thing that girls do in clubs) but I'm not 50%-50%. When I was a teenager you could argue I was exclusively attracted to men for about a year - girls did not interest me, boys did. I then went through a phase of exactly the opposite. Now it's not as fluid (but it still moves) but I'd still say I was attracted to both sexes even though I'm engaged to a woman.

*Maybe* Mata is just a big name signing to paper over the cracks more than fix their real problems (Defence and Centre Midfield).

*Maybe* RVP will once again become the injury prone player he was at Arsenal.

*Maybe* United won't get CL and Rooney will go to Madrid, leaving Suarez with no destination.

*Maybe* Adebayor, saviour of Tottenham, will fall back into the player he sometimes does once he's comfortable.

*Maybe* Tottenham's form will faulter once the EL restarts and they play decent sides in the league again.

*Maybe* the injuries Everton have will make their season crumble and they'll finish 7th, we know they won't get another striker as good as Lukaku for next year unless they get CL football.

*Maybe* if we lose Suarez, well get Â£60m plus that we can spend on top players to replace him and Gerrard. With money left over for better squad players.

With how the summer and now the January window went I think this season is the one where we have our best shot.  United will be resurgent soon.  For all the shit Moyes has taken and how bad they've been this season they're still not far off of our pace and they've just shown they're not afraid to spend big, plus their name can still attract the big names even if they seem to be underperforming as a team.  Spurs is only going to get better and Arsenal has money now too.

Our more frugal way of doing things means that if everyone else starts slinging cash about we'll fall behind, at least in the short term.  I think if we miss out on 4th this season it'll take a few more before we have a good shot at getting back into it.  However if we do hit 4th this season, we'll be able to make the right signings to keep hold of it or move up even further.

These companies are used to short term (1-3 year) contracts with students, and as such make the bulk of their money through huge admin fees (Â£120 for tenant network), and by taking as much of your deposit as possible. Private landlords are the way to go. 

As for things to do, the seafront is beautiful all year round, but avoid the arcade. The pyramids centre on the seafront is a really good live music venue, as is the Wedgewood rooms on Albert road. Assuming that you are a young(ish) teacher, I would avoid guildhall square as a night out- it's typically full of students that are lagered up. Instead, why not take a trip down Elm grove and Albert road? There are loads of pubs and bars, most of which play live music at some point during the week. The wine vaults is a great place for people looking to get away from the students and enjoy a quality glass of wine in a relaxed environment. 

The isle of wight is just a hovercraft ride away; whilst it isn't the liveliest of places there are great places to walk and there are 2 really great music festivals there over the summer (Isle of Wight festival and Bestival), both of which are really worth going to.

Train will sort you out between the main cities in the uk, and the train from Paddington to Cornwall via Exeter and the Devon coast is very scenic.  But the train is very limited to get around cornwall, buses will be hard work too, it's an area where a car is more or less required for full exploration.

You could consider B&amp;B's instead of hostels, might be a bit nicer?

As for Cornwall it really depends where your photographer is based, personally I know and love North Cornwall the most - the area around Newquay, Padstow, Wadebridge, Tintagel:

- Newquay itself is good for surfing, not so 'romantic' though, lots of drunk young'uns.  
- The [Bedruthan Steps](http://www.alexnail.com/gallery-images/thrift-bedruthan.jpg) would be an amazing photo location.  
- Jamie Oliver has a restuarant around here.  
- Padstow has lots of fresh seafood, Rick Stein is the most famous restuaranteur in town.  
- [Port Isaac](http://www.runic.com/gallery/albums/cornwall/port-isaac/port-isaac-coastal-1.jpg) is a cute coastal village used for filming TV shows
- [Boscastle](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000RuAI.xYEb5E/s/880/boscastle-13443.jpg) is another famously photogenic natural harbour / village.
- [Tintagel](http://www.barrashouse.com/uploads/1/0/8/1/10818326/8891835_orig.jpg) is probably the most famous castle in Cornwall although very ruined. 
- As for beaches there are many all along the coast, it's hardly worth naming names.

But if your guy lives down on the Lizard that's probably all irrelevant.

One other location idea, the open-air, cliff-top [Minack theatre](http://static.squarespace.com/static/50dc7a0ee4b00220dc74215a/t/5176f9dae4b0e95e599db26e/1366751710281/Minack_touched_lowRes.jpg) would be pretty awesome I reckon, but I'm guessing somewhere like that would expect you to book/pay to use it for 'professional' photos?

Where's this evidence? If it's so damning and completely blows the police's claims of ""no target setting"" to smithereens, where the fuck is it? What is it? I mean, seriously?

&gt; One officer failing to reach his targets was told that every shift he had to ""take a laser out and spend at least one hour on this task during the day"".

Too fucking right! If he hasn't caught any body doing anything wrong on our roads over an extended period of time, then he's obviously not doing a very good job, as our roads are fucking rampant with it. Sitting there with a speed gun is certainly better than sitting in a lay-by with his thumb up his arse because he can't be bothered. 

&gt; Another source said: ""People are discouraged to deal with anything other than offences that count towards our targets.""

I don't even begin to know how to deal with a statement this irritating. Dealing with offences is their *job*. I personally know a number of police officers who have the delightful job of investigating, collating and providing evidence for prosecuting murderers, rapists, thieves and any number of other crimes that we all place emphasis on bringing to justice. Yes, there are police officers who have to deal with the mediocre, boring shit, but there are also police officers who work in the likes of CID, CMU, FET, etc who deal with the more severe stuff.

true,Fluorophore1,null,null,"Hello - Edinburgh postgrad student here.  
 

**Housing** - Single rooms are normal in UK universities, shared is the exception.  Edinburgh University usually house 6 - 12 same-sex students in the same flat / floor of a building.  You can decide whether you want to have meals cooked for you / do your own cooking and whether you want your own private bathroom or not.  See the guide below for living areas.  You'd be based around George Square campus so any of the central student halls would be ok and all are within 10 minutes walk of classes.  
 

**Classes** - I can't speak for politics classes, you'd be better asking over at /r/Edinburgh_University.  I'd imagine that they're fairly challenging. Workload seems to depend on year and the classes you're chosen.  Undergrads taks 120 credits a year to pass, with each course contributing 20 or 40 credits.  [Have a look at this page for more information](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/undergrad/on_course_students/undergraduate_teaching_office/year_1_2) or maybe you could [contact the course secretary.](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/about/contact)
 
 
**Good and bad about the school** - Again, no idea - try /r/Edinburgh_University
 
 

**Social scene, etc** - [Here is a guide](http://www.ed.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.18125!/fileManager/Guide_for_Staff_New_to_Edinburgh.pdf) for university staff which will answer your questions on costs and areas, etc. It applies just as well to students. 
Clubs / partying / sex life are all in abundance if you go looking for them.  In a UK wide poll in 2012, the university [ranked 54th countrywide](http://www.studentbeans.com/student101/a/relationships/university-sex-league-2656.html) in terms of promiscuity (as a student average).

**Edinburgh stacking up to St Andrews** - I think Edinburgh is much better than St Andrews, both academically and in quality of life.  I wouldn't even consider St. Andrews  - it's tiny with two (one?) night club(s) and this bizarre dynamic where the non-student residents actually resent the students because they're not faced with having to live there all year long.  It's remote and there's very little to do but study and cry because you wish you'd gone to Edinburgh.

**International students** - Edinburgh is super international and you'll be very welcome.  There's little violence and you'll be surrounded by international students.  There are student societies for international students even though most people make friends with those in their accommodation.  

 
Come to Edinburgh, you won't regret it.

true,SportingShooter,null,null,"&gt;At the moment the benefit of licensing of rifles and shotguns to farmers is generally seen to outweigh the harm. With an easily concealed weapon the harm outweigh's the benefits

I suppose that's the crux of this argument. Some people think that the benefits of having pistol shooting available as a pursuit in the UK, like rifle and shotgun sports already are, outweighs the potential for harm. The same way that fireworks, alcohol and all the other examples given on this page have been 'allowed' despite the risks. Others, meanwhile, think that pistol shooting - and for some people, all forms of shooting - do not present enough of a benefit to outweigh the potential for these machines to be used in violent crime.

It's interesting that this boils down largely to concealment. The ban on handguns in the UK is really a ban on firearms under a certain length - that's why pistol shooters in England, Scotland and Wales use [stuff like this](http://www.justpistols.co.uk/superbh_001.jpg) to stay within the law. Ensuring that all legal guns are too long to put in your pocket (and making it illegal to shorten a long-barelled weapon) is one way of dealing with the specific possibility of a loon sneaking it somewhere to cause a lot of suffering.

I personally think that there could be scope for heavily-controlled .22 pistol shooting, like they have in the Olympics. Pistols stored in clubs rather than at home, specific licences granted only to those who can demonstrate their responsibility and who are actively involved in competitive target shooting... That sort of thing. It would be good to see British pistol shooting enjoy the success that Team GB has had in the shotgun disciplines.",0,1390843127,null,0,false,0,cf05h7a,t3_1w9vfd,t1_cf05h7a,t1_cf051fp,null,1432129577,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

* I don't know of any halls here where you have to share a room. Catered accommodation in Pollock halls is pretty standard. Corridors of single rooms with either a single or double bed depending on which building you're in. Selfcatered is usually a flat of some description. You'll get your own room and then you share a communal living space and kitchen with between 3 to 4 other people. Both catered and self-catered have a range of shared and ensuite bathrooms.

* I obviously don't have that much first hand experience in political science courses here but the workload will very much depend on what stage of your degree you're in. Anecdotally the first few years seem to have a lesser work load that physics/maths but that's just my experience.

* Socially there's always something going on in halls if you end up staying there, and there's all sorts of societies and clubs to suit every interest. The clubs range from the cheap, dirty and, in my opinion, extremely fun, like ""The hive"" to the more expensive and still a lot of fun like opal. I think in pollock the meal costs are covered in your rent and you get breakfast and dinner every day. 

* Because Edinburgh is the capital and far more central than St. Andrews it's incredibly easy to travel to other parts of the country and sight see. For example Glasgow is 50 minutes away on the train Newcastle is about 2 hours. There's pretty much hehaw to do in St Andrews and the only plus side really is the sea side in the summer.

1. St Michael's Mount: http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/st-michaels-mount/ - A small castle on an island - it can be very photogenic in nice weather!

2. Lanhydrock: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanhydrock - A stately home, like the fictional Downton Abbey.

Those are some of the most impressive old buildings, but any town you go to will have some history to it. I often drink in the Blue Anchor in Helston (~600 year old building) which brews its own beer (Spingo). The ""Special"" is pretty good and rather strong! Though I have to say that Helston itself isn't that special. *Fun Fact: Helston is where the Olympic Flame landed.*

There are some lovely beaches etc on The Lizard: http://www.visitlizardcornwall.co.uk/documents/visitlizard_cornwall.pdf - I'd say it's generally less crowded than going to the North Coast. [Kynance Cove](http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5148379) is lovely. Perhaps a walk around Loe Bar if you don't want to climb many hills.

Plenty of pre-history available if you don't mind looking at small stone circles: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Prehistoric_sites_in_Cornwall
A number of these can be found on nice walks up high where you can see the sea on both the North and South coasts!

Long guns have uses and are harder to conceal, making them less of a danger. The balance of benefit to risk justifies allow them under heavy regulation.

I'll extend this point to point out that hand-guns aren't totally banned. The police and armed forces have them, as do (apparently) some others I didn't know about before this thread. I'm fine with that because they have a use them, while the extra danger justifies the tighter regulations that prevent hobbists owning them.

The victim in this case is so profoundly disabled that there's no realistic prospect of her caring for herself or living independently in the future.

The award will pay for adaptations to her current home (or a new home) so that she can live comfortably. She'll require a specialist bedroom and bathroom, a space for her carer/s to stay and wheelchair access throughout. She'll also require another specialist home if her parents ever need to move. She will also require specially adapted cars for the rest of her life as well. 

The money will also pay for the numerous specialist carers that she will need throughout her life. She will need assistance with every aspect of her life, for the rest of her life. Once her parents are no longer capable of assisting, she will need 24 hour live in care from numerous medical professionals. 

She's also going to receive compensation for future loss of earnings. She will never be able to work or earn money, and part of the award is compensation for this. 

All of this doesn't include the payment simply for her physical injuries and loss of quality of life, of course.

true,chellegram,null,null,"I was an international student at Edinburgh (visiting student for one term, transferred to stay for another 2 years and complete my degree) and I saw no difference in the way that international students were treated. Depending on the course you may encounter more or fewer foreign students, but soooo many students at Edinburgh are foreign, you'll be just another one. My social group and one acquaintance level out had American, Canadian, Dutch, Swedish, Luxembourgish, Polish, Russian, Mexican, Taiwanese and German students. 

I loved Edinburgh, and would recommend it over St Andrews if only because you're asking about social scene, and there is so much more going on in Edinburgh. You can easily day trip to St Andrews if you want to check it out, as well as travel to many other places around Scotland from Edinburgh.

I studied history, so I can't really speak specifically to the PoliSci/Govt courses, but I did find that Edinburgh had significantly less regular homework than I was used to, but more reading. Your reading list for class won't be 1 or 2 assigned books that your reading comes out of, it will be several pages long with chapters recommended here and there. Your suggested reading before a class may include 10 books, multiple chapters each. I don't think anyone read all the suggested reading before each class, but reviewed enough of it that they were prepared for the discussion or lecture that happened that day. Again, different department, so YMMV, but I found that to be true in the classes I took in both History and Archaeology. You will also be actually in class for fewer hours a week, since you are doing more of the reading independently. It took me a bit of time to adjust to that, I have to say, since I was used to my time being structured for me and found that I had to learn to structure it for myself.

My biggest advice to an international student at Edinburgh would be to join one or two clubs or societies at the uni - you'll meet a group of students with a similar interest, and that's where I found friends. It was much easier to learn the social scene, where the parties were, where the clubs were, etc. when I was part of a group that had already been in the city for a couple of years. I found everyone very welcoming - no one too bothered about me being new, American, or only there for a semester (though obviously that changed).

Let me know if there's anything else that I might be able to answer. I hope you go, and have a great time.

When we had only Suarez and Carroll the club let Carroll go on loan, promising a replacement that never came. At the time it was over a reported 2 million in valuation of Dempsey.

I am not giving my opinions on the merits of these moves, just illustrating that BR role in the actual business of buying and selling players is much more limited than some people seem to think.

If we are pissed at a lack of investment in the team, i imagine he is absolutely furious. Don't buy into the company line.... transfer committee is working hard, owners have been fantastic. That's just for the media.

But, Chelsea also owns his brother. We own a few of his Belgian teammates. And, Chelsea is in the top soccer market in the world. 

Obviously, things could change. All of these applied to Mata (swap Belgium for Spain) and he wanted to leave, but that was because of a lack of playing time. Hazard is obviously a favorite of Jose and will continue to be the starter. We will pay Hazard what he deserves and Chelsea will be a threat in every competition. The only reason Hazard would leave is if something major changes. Maybe he doesn't like London. Maybe he and Jose have a disagreement. Maybe a team like Monaco offers him silly wages.

Borini, Allen, Henderson, and Aspas are players on the current roster who have already significantly lost value--not to mention the costs we are still amortizing like Carroll and Downing. It is a good increase, but we need to be realistic about our revenues, as we have still posted losses in the last two years. 

I truly believe that we won't surpass any other EPL clubs in revenue without improving the results on the pitch. Luckily, our commercial department is doing really well, and the improvement in revenues that there is to be had is in match day and results-based earnings. But we're lucky to be at the levels we are, and we haven't overtaken anyone of import in the EPL since FSG have stepped in, we've merely retained our place in the revenue hierarchy. That is good in order to ensure we don't get worse as a club, but we haven't had the revenues to significantly improve the squad and get a whole lot better.

Edit: Also, it should be said that City, Arsenal, Chelsea and United all surpassed our revenue increases (all but Arsenal were at least 50% higher), and only City can use the CL increase as an explanation. It is good that we are in the same conversation, but we aren't on the level with those teams in terms of revenue, and we need to be close.

Flying into London will be the most convenient and cheapest. Not many airports outside London even have a transatlantic route. From the midwest maybe Chicago is near? You can get direct flights from there on AA and BA, saving the hassle of a change. Delta goes direct to Minneapolis too. You're probably going to struggle to get return flights for less than Â£400 return per person, regardless of time of year. 

Transport in London has been covered. Get an Oyster card and get a tube map. tfl.gov.uk has a route planner for all your journeys within London.

For Cornwall, buses are all run by small operators in each town and city, though First Bus is a big operator. It isn't integrated like London. Trains, you're going to be using First Great Western out of London Paddington to get to Cornwall. They also do an overnight train right down to Penzance. Their route map is here http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/~/media/PDF/Routemaps/network-map.ashx  Since they use Paddington, if you get the Heathrow Express or Connect you're in the same station for connections to South West England. 

Since Cornwall is isolated and has fairly poor connections you might just want to hire a car once you're down there. 

Seafood is common there. Padstow has some well known restaurants. Bigger towns in the area are Plymouth, Truro, Newton Abbot, Newquay, Exeter so they're all going to have a range of stuff. (Some of those might be in Devon but they're all close.)

Cornwall isn't the place to be for beer or wine. The UK in general isn't the best place for wine. Cornwall is mostly going to be about cider. Strong cider. For beer stay in London and go to the small breweries like Partizan, Kernel, Redchurch, London Fields and the list goes on and on.

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt;So could I fairly ask the question of ""In order to indulge recreational drinking, do you consider 100,000 deaths, 100's of rapes etc etc etc to be acceptable?""

When I indulge in recreational drinking I also abide by the laws that govern such drinking. Laws put in place to limit the potential harm to myself, others and society. I can't drink whilst underage, I could be arrested for drunk and disorderly if I get out of control and I could be done for drink driving etc etc.

There are many people who think the laws on drink driving are to restrictive, they claim they are perfectly safe to drive after having a few and some of them *might* be right... many of them are just deluding themselves in thinking that. The point is that no matter what your personal tolerance for alcohol the law has to draw a line somewhere as to what is acceptable risk and what isn't.

With firearms legislation just as with drink driving legislation the law has drawn a line. One that may inconvenience and annoy some, but one that is nonetheless drawn for the protection of society as a whole. 

Drink driving rates and related deaths have been dropping steadily over the years, we are far more cognisant of the dangers of drink driving, we are mostly a law-abiding and responsible society... does that mean we should deregulate drink driving? If we did what do you think would happen to those drink driving rates are related deaths?

To me deregulating handguns is on a par with repealing drink drive legislation. We drew a line back in 1997 as to what we as a society considered acceptable, we shut the stable door on that particular horse and I think it would be foolish to open that door again and hope that the horse won't run to far.",0,1390847892,null,0,false,0,cf07ova,t3_1w9vfd,t1_cf07ova,t1_cf03u1v,null,1432130727,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I read that disgusting article in the Telegraph today about how the whole thing was conducted through agents and that Man U didn't even have the courtesy to speak to our guys through fear we would open up the idea of buying Rooney.

The thing I've come to accept, is that this deal was about the money above all else. We don't think of ourselves as a 'selling' club, but I think we were in this case. I believe Mourinho when he says that he would've ideally held onto Mata (even if just for this season he is great cover for the later stages when injuries may take their toll). The stuff about respecting Mata and not letting him sit on the bench during a World Cup year is bollocks, we have been fighting Man U for signings in a bitter war over the past 10 years, looking for any angle we can get on one another, and no one at Chelsea (apart from the fans) would give a shit about Mata's feelings keeping him on the bench if it meant keeping him away from our biggest rival of the Abramovich era.

Look at the squad profile and how it has changed to us buying younger players and loaning/ selling on. We are trying (and succeeding) to comply with financial fair play. The money was too much to turn down for a 'non-essential' player. That's the bottom line. I'd like to think we were so strong that we can afford to just offload such a great player, but unfortunately there are few teams in the world who wouldn't be weaker without Juan Mata, and we are not one of them.

**Coat:** The Doctor's coat is a custom made coat by Crombie in the style of their 'Navy Retro Coat'. The pockets, buttons and collar were changed. Although unique, Crombie seem interested in producing more of these custom coats (should the BBC allow it, I suspect they won't) for Â£795 each. The coat it's based on is [HERE](http://www.crombie.co.uk/the-coat/?___SID=U).

**Cardigan:** The cardigan is also from Crombie and appears to be [THIS](http://www.crombie.co.uk/navy-merino-wool-cardigan.html) exact one. It's also in the sale...for Â£125.

**Boots:** The Doctor's shoes were officially stated as being Dr Martens but that's apparently not the case at all. They're in fact from a company called Loakes and you can get the exact ones from [HERE](http://www.britboot.co.uk/engine/shop/product/HW01/Loake+-+Black+Smooth+Leather+Brogue+Boot+%28860%29)! I'd be quick though, stock isn't likely to last long now we know this! 

That's all we know for certain right now, if you want to keep up with this sort of stuff yourself, this [blog](http://twelfthdoctorcostume.blogspot.co.uk) by the brilliant Steve Ricks is regularly updated by him when he finds new parts of the Doctor's outfit. Trust me, he's brilliant!

Edit: I'm not going to update this anymore as we've pretty much worked out every piece of his brilliant new outfit.

Obviously competing for the 2 aren't mutually exclusive, and I also can understand the position that the future is bright with Martinez and we may be better positioned and suited to fight for CL either next year or in a couple years, but from club ambition perspective, it clearly makes more sense to me to be a consistent competitor for the Champions League as the long term implications are of such greater value in terms of the players we can attract, as well as the potential investors that CL could bring to the club. Winning an FA Cup, while a tremendous achievement, doesn't make sense to me to be something that supporters should necessarily aspire to be winning every year and value more than finishing top 4. One bad match or even an unfortunate referee decision and your Cup run can end, winning a cup takes almost as much luck as it does ability. We would evolve and improve the most as a club if we consistently compete for and ultimately achieve Champions League, and therefore to me I think it makes more sense for supporters in general to value finishing top 4 ahead of winning an FA or League Cup.

This is exactly the problem that needs solving, it's a chicken and egg problem.  There is no justification at all for spending Â£2900 per person in the North East -- it would just be money thrown away because there is no business to take advantage of it.

The solution then is to break the cycle.  Hence my suggestion.  Get the North self-sustaining by encouraging business, then it becomes worthwhile spending the money on infrastructure.

To commence use of the term intelligence with regard to plant behaviour will lead to a better understanding of the complexity of plant signal transduction and the discrimination and sensitivity with which plants construct images of their environment, and raises critical questions concerning how plants compute responses at the wholeâplant level.

It sounds as if they were doing an intracranial angiogram to delineate the anatomy of an AVM they were going to treat, but instead of a contrast hand injection they used the syringe of embolisation material, basically causing her to have a massive stroke.  

It's a simple error but with disastrous consequences.  Normally, the embolisation material isn't opened and prepared until the last minute.

true,DF44,cnty-wales,Welshman stuck in Liverpool,"Flat rate taxes are nowhere near as fair as they sound. In fact, in general they're downright unfair.

Let's take Bob the person earning Â£10,000 (before tax) a year and Jack the person earning Â£100,000 a year, both living in Country X. If you take, say, 25% out of both, you leave Bob with Â£7,500 a year and Jack with Â£75,000 a year. Now let's say that in Country X it costs Â£6,000 a year in order to have a basic standard of living - this pays for food and the bills. This leaves Bob with Â£1,500 a year and Jack with Â£69,000 a year. You'll notice that because taxes will always apply *before* basic expenses, it is substantially unfair on the lower end wage earner to have a flat tax rate - despite earning just 10x more money, Jack's income once you take into consideration basic living costs is closer to 45x higher (You can make a case it's lower since Jack's basic living costs will likely be higher due to his lifestyle, which is understandable).

It's not as if a progressive tax system actively punishes increased earnings - it's not as if going from a Â£195,000 salary to a Â£205,000 salary will suddenly cause you to make less money overall after tax if there's a tax bracket that ends at Â£200,000, all it means is that money after the Â£200,000 is earned will be taxed higher - it slightly raises the overall tax percent, but you still earn more overall. Because of the way Tax Brackets work, we can make it so all people manage to have a high enough income to match basic living costs - we could do that in the abovementioned Country X by not taxing any income below Â£6,000. This means that however much you earn, the first Â£6,000 of income will not be taxed at all. You could then say that money from Â£6,000 to Â£10,000 will be taxed at rate n%. Anyone who earns Â£7,000 before tax will not be taxed on the first Â£6,000, and then will be taxed n% on the remaining Â£1,000.

I don't see how a flat tax would change the rate of people avoiding paying tax - unless their tax is simply lowered, which would simply result in the government getting substantially less from tax revenue (Increasing the tax on the poor does not fund a decrease of tax on the rich).",0,1390852455,null,0,false,0,cf09vgo,t3_1wa181,t1_cf09vgo,t1_cf06q4l,null,1432131901,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

true,brotherwayne,null,null,"&gt; That is because gun murders do not matter. For instance, if Country #1 changes its gun laws and all of a sudden has only one gun murder and 5 knife murders, nothing has been achieved. The country would still be just as violent, just as many people would die, but it would be a statistical ""win"" going by that chart, because less would be gun related. The point is to look at how it affects the overall murder rate.

""gun murders do not matter"" -- really? There's a lot of ""if"" in that paragraph. The big difference between guns and knives is simple: it's easier to kill multiple people with a gun. I suppose if somehow gun homicide was replaced with knife homicide then it wouldn't matter. I just don't see how that would be logical. Perhaps you can find some data that shows that gun homicide is simply replaced with knife homicide when access to guns is restricted? 

I don't know of inter-country studies that address this. However here's one for the inter-state gun violence in the US: 

http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/13/2617131/largest-gun-study-guns-murder/

&gt;With all this preliminary work in hand, the authors ran a series of regressions to see what effect the overall national decline in firearm ownership from 1981 to 2010 had on gun homicides. The result was staggering: âfor each 1 percentage point increase in proportion of household gun ownership,â Siegel et al. found, âfirearm homicide rate increased by 0.9â³ percent. A one standard deviation change in firearm ownership shifted gun murders by a staggering 12.9 percent.

Violent crime rate was factored in to the regression.

Is that definitely a waistcoat? It looks more like a fine knit cardigan to me (although I'm happy to be corrected). Another difference between them if it is.

I agree with you though. While the overall silhouette is similar to Eleven's second outfit (boots, straight legged trousers, mid length coat), it's only superficial.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"I appreciate that being honest, rather than bunny hugging isn't appreciated here, I guess my views where shaped as a teenager watching my parents business fail in large part due to monies owed to them and subsequent cash flow issues.

But I can understand the pressure they were under.  In a way as a bank they had been too risk taking.  Admittedly mostly it was due to ABN, rather than their small company investments.

But is it in a way the problem.  **People wanted the banks to ""lend responsibly"".  When they started to do that people complain.**

It's funny because in this sub a few weeks ago I was reminding a young entrepreneur to raise about 3 times the money they reckoned they needed.  It was along the lines of, if you can't service the extra debt, your business isn't worth it, if you ever need the extra money, no one will want to lend it to you.

As harsh as it is, I sort of agree with the decision they made.  If it was a bad call, another bank would have been happy to lend you the money on a personally secured basis with only mildly horrific interest rates attached.

Also remember, there is no shame at all in failing.  9 out of 10 startups fail is something I had written up on my wall.  But it is not helpful to ever blame the wrong thing.  Needing urgent liquidity and failing to get a loan is not a failure of the banks.  It is of the business model.  Given how you title it to blame RBS for the failing, I hope you don't consider that true, they didn't help, they didn't throw a life line, but they didn't make it fail either.",0,1390852892,null,0,false,0,cf0a35z,t3_1wajao,t1_cf0a35z,t1_cf09lc2,null,1432132008,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; donât really understand the question. Iâm tempted to say something like, âNo, the John Hurt War Doctor is just something that happened in THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR, THE NIGHT OF THE DOCTOR and THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR on television.â

&gt;If it happens on the TV, itâs canonical, unless it isnât. (For example, no-one seems entirely sure whether we get to see pre-Hartnell regenerations during the mindbending battles of Brain of Morbius.)

&gt;We now know there was a regeneration between the Paul McGann Eighth Doctor and the Chris Ecclestone Ninth Doctor, one whom the Doctor himself has only just begun to regard as being The Doctor (as opposed to being something else).

&gt;If you mean, âDo we now all have to agree to renumber all the Doctors?â, I think the main purpose of numbering things is to communicate, and we all know who we mean when we say Doctors NIne, Ten or Eleven. If anyone corrects you and says âYou mean TWELFTH!â when you say âMatt Smith was the eleventh Doctorâ then that person is being irritatingly pedantic and should be pitied, in a nice way and with a gentle friendly, not-patronising sort of love, because they will have long hard lives ahead of them.",0,1390852904,null,0,false,0,cf0a3d9,t3_1wawfs,t1_cf0a3d9,t1_cf09opc,null,1435515506,18,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,18

I mean, there's loads of bitching on here about how we're not buying anyone this transfer window, but honestly out of the top eight clubs Mata is the only major purchase anyone has made. Chelsea have Salah and Everton have Traore on loan and that basically seems to be about it right now. It's not like all the other clubs are spending big money and leaving us trailing behind because BR isn't getting given anything to spend. We do have an awfully thin squad, but it's a thin squad that's still managed to get us to where we are in the table despite some injuries to key players (Allen, Enrique, Sturridge, Gerrard).

I think there's a big difference between not being allowed to spend anything, and not being allowed to pay over the odds for people, and we definitely seem to be more in the latter category than the former. And it's not helped by the fact that we don't have any extra fat in the squad right now to sell and help fund a few potentially exuberant transfers.",0,1390853766,null,0,false,0,cf0ain2,t3_1wartv,t1_cf0ain2,t1_cf09ih8,null,1432132164,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

We know they took his knowledge of dematerialization out, so it's just as logical as they could insert knew knowledge in.  So they gave him some personal combat skills (although The Doctor already knew how to handle a sword).  When he regenerated, he lost these skills, since they were not really his own to begin with.

&gt;**Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor** is a series of audiobooks produced by Big Finish Productions for AudioGo. They were released monthly through the first eleven months of 2013 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of British television series Doctor Who. The series - composed of eleven separate releases, one for each incarnation of the Doctor - is performed in the third-person by an actor associated with each era of the show, with additional dialogue provided by a guest actor, in a similar vein to Big Finish's own The Companion Chronicles series. The series is notable for being the first (and only) time Big Finish was allowed to directly feature current era (2005 onwards) characters, due to the collaboration with AudioGo.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"This seems to be the major consensus on here now, and I kind of don't get why people are being quite *so* negative. 

I swear when we were top of the league December the general opinion was roughly ""we should get top four, if we have a decent transfer window we can maybe push for the title"". Then we lose to Chelsea and City, which was a bit gutting, but to be honest most people would only have expected us to take one or maybe three points from those games, and we ran them pretty damn close either way. And in real points terms the only teams who properly gained ground on us that week were Arsenal, City and Chelsea - Everton and Spurs were always fairly close behind us. And even then everyone still seemed fairly positive, with the whole ""we play everyone important at home in the second half of the season"". 

We had a dodgy game against Stoke that we were perhaps lucky to win, and a poor performance against Villa and we dropped two points - are those two games really enough to turn our squad from ""[we can try and aim higher than fourth](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1uwj6e/shreeves_meets_gerrard_good_interview/)"" to ""shit we're not good enough we really need some more players"". It's only slightly over a month since we completely kicked the shit out of Spurs and beat them 5-0 on their own turf. Having beaten West Ham and Norwich 4-1 and 5-1 respectively just before that too. 

I do think our squad is thin, but it's still the same squad that have been winning games consistently this season and have gotten us where we are now. We've had players like Suarez, Sturridge, Coutinho, Gerrard, Allen, Flanagan and Enrique out of the side for stretches of several weeks and we're still in 4th place and touching distance of the top three. And whilst our bench is pretty dire compared to the top three, I don't think it's much worse than the people we're fighting over 4th with. 

I'd love it if we signed a few key players and strengthed, and I think it'll be tight for the top four, but I feel people here are being excessively negative about how we have next to no chance if we don't sign anyone. United have got Mata to add one quality player to a side that is pretty mediocre this season besides Rooney and RVP, and Everton now have Traore (probably the signing that concerns me the most). Chelsea have Salah and Matic (though are now minus Mata and De Bruyne). And that's basically it. We're not signing anyone, but it's not like the rest of the top 7 are all splashing out on loads of big name signings. It's been a fairly quiet January so far all round. 

I argued with some people on here who thought we'd definitely beat City and Chelsea in December for being ridiculously over-optimistic, and now it seems we've had two dodgy performances and suddenly even 4th place is a stretch to most people unless we sign someone. We lost two of the toughest games we'll play this season, and then had two dodgy performances (which we still took four points from). We've still been playing better football than Spurs, United by a long way this season, and arguably Chelsea too for most of it. Fourth is going to be a scrap, but it's not like we've lost any key players from the ""winning the league is actually a possibility"" squad we had back when we were top on Christmas Day.

This means no matter what rates the BoE sets, high or low, the UK government is not going to run out of capacity to raise and spend pounds. It can always afford its pound denominated debts. That's the difference between being a currency-*issuer* (such as the UK/US/Japan/Aus) and a currency-*user* (such as Greece/your household/your business). The latter can run out of the currency-issuer's currency, the former cannot.

&gt; For an extreme example, see Zimbabwe, although no UK government could survive making things anywhere close to that bad.

Apparently you're not aware of [what happened](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=3773) in Zimbabwe. It was a combination of a complete supply side collapse (Mugabe took land off productive farmers, handed it to blacks that did not know how to work it - destroying agricultural output by 50%+) and **huge** foreign denominated debts. That is, Zimbabwe borrowed USD. Zimbabwe does not issue the USD, and printing trillions of ZWL to buy up every single USD for sale in ZWL is only going to tank the currency, which it did. Currency becomes worthless on forex markets overnights, the rest is history.

The UK government is not systematically destroying supply, and does not have any noteworthy foreign denominated debts. It *could* still order the central bank to buy USD until no amount of pounds can buy anymore, destroying the currency and economy with it, but it could never be forced to by creditors (which the government owes only *pounds*, not USD).",0,1390855331,null,0,false,0,cf0basx,t3_1w9wbh,t1_cf0basx,t1_cf0amq1,null,1432132396,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;&gt;Because it puts the blame on the victim for showing some skin.

It's not a valid answer. You're saying your proof that it's blaming the victim is that it's blaming the victim. the 'for showing some skin' part is simply rewording part of what I called good advice in a 'laddish' way.

By your own statistic (which has not been sourced but for the purpose of my point is irrelevant), 15% of rapes are committed by strangers. How many women is that a year? As my original point **clearly stated**, it is entirely sensible to prevent yourself from being targeted by an opportunist. That doesn't mean that if you don't, it's your own fault, just as you don't blame people for getting mugged because they pulled out their iPod to change the song.

&gt;Should girls all wear long dresses and thick jumpers? never show cleavage? Hijabs?

No, they should be aware of their surroundings, just as we all should be. It's not that 'dressing provocatively' is bad, and its not that 'drinking too much' makes you a bad person, it's that dressing provocatively, getting too drunk and going off without your friends is not a sensible thing to do. That's it, it's advice to try and prevent people from ending up hurt, because there are bad people out there.

It's a shame it has to come to this, but at the end of the day it's what you'd tell your newly-adult daughter before going out because you don't want them to get hurt.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"In theory a flat tax is fairer because it treats everyone the same but it completely ignores the difference in value of an extra 5% tax here or there for a low income person compared to a high income person. In reality a 20% tax on a low income person leaves them with a little money left over, enough to live on but not much. For a high income person they still have enough to live lavishly - gas and electricity are the same for rich and poor alike, so are food and petrol. The cost of basic living is the same for a rich person as a poor person but it accounts for a lot more of a poor person's income than a rich person's income. 

Take a hypothetical example: 

Let's imagine it costs Â£10,000 to live in this country. Imagine that's the cost of living. 

There are 2 people one earning Â£20,000 and another earning Â£125,000. Take 20% from both and they get Â£16,000 and 100,000 after tax respectively. 

The cost of living as a percentage of income for the low income person was 50% before tax and 62.5% after tax. In other words their disposable income (income left after you've paid for basic living expenses) has decreased by 25% as a percentage of their pre-tax disposable income. 

The cost of living as a percentage for the high income person went from 8% to 10%. In other words their disposable income just went down 2.2% as a percentage of pre-tax disposable income. Barely noticeable. 

The effect of a flat tax is to take more from the poor person as a proportion of their disposable income than a rich person. The sacrifice made is greater for a low income person than for a high income person despite the fact they pay the same rate. Adam Smith said basically the same thing in The Wealth of Nations, I believe; the rate of tax paid by each person should be in proportion to his income. 

Now you could of course get around this problem by simply exempting from tax anyone earning below a certain level to ensure these people are not having their income slashed. But that would mean a huge loss of tax revenue which would probably mean you would need to raise the rate and you are back to square one where the lowest percentiles are prejudiced. Or you could not raise the rate an slash public spending. This is the reason you see so many right wing conservatives in the UK and US suggesting this idea because it's just code for saying 'we're going to abolish the concept of welfare' because it could not be supported on a flat tax.

Now they can take away a benefit, politically if not financially, so they spend their time slagging off the Tories for protecting the rich because they think its what voters want to hear.

If you're under 18, the law says you aren't allowed to hold a tenancy. However, there are ways that a landlord can work around this. For example, a landlord could grant:

a tenancy that will be held on trust for you by a third party such as an adult relative or social worker, until you turn 18, or
a joint tenancy if a joint tenant is aged 18 or over.
As an alternative, you could sign an agreement with a landlord for a licence, which is different from a tenancy. Holding a licence means that you have the landlord's personal permission, rather than a legal right, to stay in the accommodation. You could then be granted a tenancy when you turn 18.

Landlords, including housing associations and local authority housing departments, may require a guarantor before giving a licence to someone under 18. If you move into local authority accommodation after leaving a childrenâs home, the social services department will often be the guarantor.

If you move into rented accommodation, you may want to claim Housing Benefit.

The reason is that the overall length is &gt;60cm which puts the gun in a different category.

The ban is hardly keeping legal guns out of the hands of criminals because any moron can take a hacksaw to that extension and thus posses an easily concealed handheld firearm. What's preventing them from doing so is the process that we have in place to apply for a certificate to own them in the first place, so we can really do without these moronic rules ruining our guns.

All the ban did was to annoy the hell out of legal pistol shooters in the UK

Slovakia introduced a flat rate system, and its tax revenues increased. As did Russia's. And its been working well in Hong Kong for a long time.

Its easier for businesses, its easier to work out, tax returns are simplified (HMRC spend over fifty million a year answering queries about tax returns), administrative costs are vastly reduced. in the countries I mentioned there and the other eastern european countries that have introduced it have seen a reduction in tax avoidance.

When the 83% tax rate was dropped in the UK, tax revenues increased. Its because although the wealthiest were taxed a lower percentage on their income, they paid that tax on more of their earnings. 30% of something is better than 0% on that money in Monaco.

Similar results were seen in the United States between 1921 and 1926, 1964 and between 1981 and 1984. A copied and pasted thing I found about those tax reductions and resulting tax increases ;- "" The latter period of tax cuts, during Ronald Reaganâs administration, led to increased tax revenue. A report of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress found that, during Reaganâs two terms, the wealthiest 10% of taxpayers paid a larger share of the Federal governmentâs tax revenue, while the lowest 50% of earners paid a smaller share of the national tax burden.""

A very simplified flate rate tax scheme could do a number of things. It could reduce the tax paid by the very poorest in society entirely, it could be administered far more cheaply, it could reduce tax avoidance, it could make things easier for small businesses and make the country more financially competitive.

true,Norvaldov,lfc68,,"I agree with you, and the way I see it, actually ensuring squad depth becomes doubly important we have a squad with so many injury prone players. Depth is then important not only as cover when these injuries do happen, but also to be able to rest tired players before injuries occur. Of course, you can't avoid injuries entirely, but if we consider what is arguably our starting eleven with everyone fit, then it would be fair to say that as much as six (seven) players have a history of injuries:

Johnson

Agger

Enrique*

Lucas

Gerrard/Allen**

Sturridge

A case in point is Lucas' injury: Rodgers presumably wanted to rest him and played Gerrard in his place against Villa because we lacked cover in his position. Gerrard is a great player, but did not take to this position well (blame him, the uneasy pairing behind him or the players in front, it doesnt really matter) and Lucas had to step in after all. 

Normally, I'd agree a team that with the amount of injuries we currently have was unlucky, but in our case it's not *all* coincidence. Flanagan and Sakho really are the only 'unforeseen' injuries of the lot. Of course, additional injuries in a back four that feature three injury prone players could be labelled bad luck, but we'd not be able to handle injuries in other areas particularly well either.

true,jgms,newcr-1,"Kompany, Hummels, Silva, Stones.","Really doubtful Barks will start. Hopefully we'll see a second half cameo but in such a high intensity match it's not worth risking his injury. That being said I really think that if we play Osman behind Lukaku we are going to struggle. His decision making and distribution is far too slow and defensive minded. 9/10 times you see Osman receive the ball he'll play it back to Barry/McCarthy/Jags, which is the exact opposite of what Barkley does. We deperately need to get the ball into Lukaku to cause problems with Liverpool's injured defence. Hopefully Pienaar at the very least will return to the left to link up with Baines and we can see Mirallas move into the middle with McGeady/Naismith on the right. It's going to be a quick game and we need high energy players like Naismith so I wouldn't be disappointed to see him come in over McGeady who doesn't look like he's fully fit just yet. 

We'll be fine at the back as long as we're not missing more than 1 of Coleman, Jags and Distin. Jags is resilient and I'm sure he won't be missing the derby unless he absolutely has to. Stones in my opinion could slot into CB or RB and would do great. He's quick and not afraid to keep his head up and look to make a forward pass. Let's pray that we don't see Heitinga line up at the start of the match because I have a feeling that Suarez could tear him to pieces. 

We'll keep Barry and Suarez attached at the hip to try and mediate his ability to control the game. The injury to Lucas is great news for us as it pushes Gerrard deeper, where he is much less effective and susceptible to pacy attacks (see Aston Villa vs Pool 1st half). It forces Henderson to take up more of the creative duties of the mid which is again good for us, as it leaves us space to move into when he pushes forward. 

It's going to be an entertaining match and if we prepare correctly and are lucky to have a couple people return from injury I think we have as good a chance as ever to get the W at Anfield.

Big rumors down here in Essex that Liverpool have been sending scouts/youth teams coaches to Roots Hall to watch our keeper Daniel Bentley. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bentley 

Bentley has been phenomenal this season keeping us in many games. I understand it's only League 2 level but the amount of clean sheets his kept this season is remarkable for a young keeper. There have also been a few rumors that this has lead to a potential England U21 call up with 12 clean sheets already this season. I know for a fact Phil Brown has been talking him up most of the season now and rightly so. It's only a matter of time before a Premier League club comes along with an offer and due to our poor financial history we will probably have to accept it. This kid will definitely end up playing Premier League football at some point and his already had comparisons to when Joe Hart was at Shrewsbury.

Summer: Big spend on a central midfielder, if not two. If we've got a budget of ~Â£25m, I'd like to see Â£15m of that spent on central midfield. We need player(s) to offer creativity from deeper and more advanced positions, whilst maintaining the defensive solidity needed in this league. Ideally a player who has the best features of Fox and Johnson, and a second who's a cross between Howson and Hoolahan.

Beyond that I wouldn't say no to a new RB, CB or a 4th winger. The latter allowing both Murphy's to go out on loan and gain experience in League 1 or the championship, as neither are yet ready for regular consideration for the first team. We'll probably need a third/fourth striker too, seeing as Elmander will return to Turkey, and Becchio might not fancy another season on the bench.

One of the things I'm looking forward to in the summer is that beyond central midfield, there's no obvious chronic deficiencies in our side.

We are growing in the right direction concerning FFP rules but we are not there yet and won't be soon I think. Chelsea had a loss of Â£40 million in 2013, due to new signings. This is still in rule with the deviation of Â£45m that FFP allows. Also keep in mind that the new Adidas sponsor deal was not taken into account (Â£300m for the next 10 years) in these figures. The coming two years a Â£45m loss is still acceptable, while the three years after that losses may only be as high as Â£30 million a year to follow FFP rules.   

There were saying at the end of 2012 Chelsea ended the year with a Â£2 million net profit, but that was due to a new injection of shares. In June 2013 it came to light that Chelsea actually made a Â£40m loss.

Basically, my aunt is in 24/7 care. She lives in a specially built house with about 5 other people who require care, and there are 2 or 3 carers working shifts living with them. The residents are very mobile and help cooking, and some of them work in a cafe that the charity runs, albeit with a lot of supervision needed. The residents go on a few sort of field-trips, just to get out and about, to places like Warwick Castle and so on. They probably appreciate the experience in a different way to you or me (my aunt grew up being cared for in a convent after a few years at home, and you can see a gear click in her head when she sees pictures of old buildings, and she gets really focussed on them, so I bet going to the castle was properly amazing for her), and it's obviously an expense greater than that of just doing enough to keep the residents alive and pretty cheerful... but everyone needs a luxury once in a while.

So yeah, that's where my father got involved in this charity from. He bought a shiteload of colouring books and crayons and painting things (stuff with ""age 3+"" on) for her for Christmas and she started showing off how she could name the things in the book. It was great, sometimes she's totally disinterested and wanders off and we just find out how she's doing from the carers.

Just like Zimbabwe, Germany's hyperinflation was a combination of supply side collapse (the government was actively paying people Papiermarks *not* to work, funding a general strike across the nation) and printing to fund *foreign* denominated debts (war reparations due in gold). If you cannot print gold, printing papiermarks to buy gold isn't going to get you out of trouble either. Austria I'll look into, but I'll be damned if it wasn't foreign denominated debts yet again.

This is **very** different to the question of : can the government afford to lower taxes today, without cutting spending, allowing private sector spending to grow &amp; creating more jobs in the process. Or, similarly, can the government afford today to increase spending, hiring those unemployed directly.

&gt; Japan has an aging population and raises most of their money internally.

Know why? Because the government's deficit spends give them the money to do so.

See, when the government spends more than it taxes, the non-government receives more money than it pays in taxes. Therefore when the government runs a deficit, the non-government runs a surplus - giving it the yen it needs to loan to the government to fund the deficit. The UK could do the exact same thing, if it wanted to.

&gt; If the UK truly ran the presses then people would dump gilts for gold, land, USD or whatever they could get.a

true,aegwilliamson,null,null,"Hi,

Everyone has given really great advice, I just wanted to chip in because I have experience with the Politics/IR school. I am a (private) tutor working with a load of students in the History/Politics departments at the University. Your workload will not be hard at all, although the specifics depends on which year you are in. Typically, you would have a couple of essays for the middle of each semester, and maybe an exam at Xmas (it would definitely depend on which module options you chose). Put it another way, you will be able to spend more time drinking than working, and still keep on top of your work. Your homework wouldn't consume you, so you can concentrate on your own consumption. 

On the St. Andrew's vs. Edinburgh debate, both are really good Universities with good reputations for their Politics Departments. St. Andrew's Politics department is ranked 6th in the UK, Edinburgh 22nd (see [here](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=politics) for the full results table). One thing to mention about Edinburgh University is that their student satisfaction is famously low. That's not necessarily a bad thing for you, particularly if you are seeing your year abroad as a chance to get to know people, and explore some of the culture. Most of the problems with student satisfaction comes from professors being slow to reply etc. That would actually suit you better. I'm not saying that you don't want to learn, but that you will get a GREAT chance to do other activities outside of your university work. Travel, join a few societies, get wrecked of your face at least once a week - all of these are super possible. 

The final thing to mention is that you should definitely take the opportunity to do a year abroad. My gf is from the US and came across to study at the University. Edinburgh is a great city (with far more going on than St. Andrews) and is a perfect base for exploring the UK. I can't recommend enough that you do it. I came up from England to do a one year MSc and loved the city I still live here - four years later. Festival time (August) is really unbelievable. 

If you've got any more questions, just let me know, but in conclusion, definitely do it.

I've got into this debate here because I think that some people strongly disagree that 'there's an argument to be made for teaching people to minimise risk'. There is an attitude from some that encouraging women to protect themselves is a sign of hating women, and the notion baffles me.

If you read through any of my previous posts (not that I'd expect you to, as I never do it to others) youd see that I very often take the other side of the argument. I fucking abhor the Daily Mail, especially that utter bastard Richard Littlejoh  who caused that poor transgendered woman to commit suicide by starting a witchunt after her.

My position was met with a lot of debate and only now do I believe you might be right, although I still don't like the idea of guns. but again is it fair to say you're a bit biased given you've been part of such a shooting club? I never said I wanted to get rid of such clubs, I just said they should keep the guns on premises, as I agree, the current law is a bit of a shambles, so for consistency with my point I say that the guns should be kept on such premises.

I linked evidence in previous posts but this wasn't to you, sorry about that. The British Standards access is given to me through my university so you may not be able to access them, so I took a [screenshot of the foreword](http://i.imgur.com/vlyxbpN.png) I mentioned in my argument. Sorry i would share it with you but my details are watermarked onto the document and I don't kow how bad something like that will come back to bite me, but if you want to see other areas of it I can oblige.

For the stats against guns: [here](https://theconversation.com/faking-waves-how-the-nra-and-pro-gun-americans-abuse-australian-crime-stats-11678). The two graphs from there are the ones I thought I linked to you earlier, sorry.

And yes I'm very aware I'm taking a more right-wing view on this issue despite being mostly liberal etc. but this is something I guess I'm a bit stubborn about. I just can't see good coming from guns. not from jobs! Jesus, as though we'd make the guns in the UK! As though thigns like power stations and less controversial careers wouldn't be more favourable (i.e. jobs that arne't likely to have their product banned in the future as a knee-jerk reaction to increased gun crime, which may or may not happen but again I'd rather not take the risk).

And trust me if I had it my way, other than those guns inside shooting club grounds, there would be NO guns in the UK at all. The best way to expel all risk. And yes I'm sure bats can be used in a simialr fashion but not from the range that a gun can be used. Self defence could save a life against such an attack but not if it's a gun - there's no hope.

That data I just linked is what i was talking about for data going either way. We could argue about this until the cows come home, and maybe they're not so bad, but I still would never vote to relax such laws. it would do no good to tell the pro-gun lobbyists ""we told you so"" if shit went wrong, and I can't see the world being brighter or happier with guns, rather than a paranoid ""shit I better get a gun, everyone else might have one"" society.

Our attack is one of the best in the world, but our goal difference isn't nearly as impressive. That's enough to suggest a winger isn't all that necessary unless you just want to outscore every opponent. 

With that said we need at least one cm coming in this winter, I would personally like 2. A deep-lying playmaker and a young pivotal midfielder to alternate with Lucas. Then we obviously need a lb like who you said, preferably who can play either flank and can cross well. I think another right footed central back is in order too due too our injury prone squad, I thought we were overstocked with CBs but holy fuck we can hardly find a reliable pair anymore

tl;dr - We NEED a LB, CDM, CM and then a CB before a winger, our attack is outstanding.

So I think we'll just have to agree to disagree. maybe I am being illogical when comparing guns to bats and other weapons used in murders. Again I still think that if guns were widespread, those homicide stats would drop for such weapons only to be made up by the homicide stats for guns, as criminals would defer to the better weapon.

But yes if the pistols are allowed on the strict FAC license I suppose they could see a place in our society.

I remember watching the first half comfortably from the sofa, but with 2 minutes before the half, I watched in horror as the power went. Nepal runs on a load-sharing system, or artificially induced blackout affecting various sections of the cities at different times so as not to overload the generators. I checked the load-sharing schedule and realized that the power wouldn't be restored until another hour, and the match would be long done by then.

I quickly ran downstairs and asked a neighbor about where I could watch the game, and he responded that there was a bar about 2 kilometers away that specialized in EPL matches and had an inverter to power their TV. Now this was about 11pm in Nepal, which meant that a lot of businesses were closed by this point, including most taxi services. I had no license to drive in a foreign country and also had no access to a vehicle, so I did what any LFC fan would do. 

I ran.

I didn't even know where exactly I was going, the guy had just pointed in a general direction and described some landmarks I would see if I was going the right way. Thankfully, I was pretty good at finding my way.

I remember realizing the absurdity of the situation on my way there: It was 11 pm, pitch black due to a blackout, except for homeless fires on the sides of the street, and me *sprinting* through the alley ways of Kathmandu, a city that I was not familiar with in the least, just to watch my redmen beat the shit out of the Mancs. 100% worth it.

Or even the electrician that fixes lines to your house without your knowledge? Its a fact that referees are below par. To award a penalty or not is debatable, but the reason we have diving in the game is because of referees not being consistent with their decisions. In each game its clear to see when a ref awards a foul and a yellow for one thing and 10 minutes later same thing happens with the opposition team and its not even a foul. Half these refs aren't even fit to begin with. You look at Phil Dowd and the guy can barely run. Then there's refs like Mike Dean who are always attention hungry. These refs also get invited to the most elite events where they mingle with the top professionals in the sport. They live a celebrity life. Thankless job my ass.

Having to justify one's decisions should always be in the program. The head referee in charge of overlooking all other refs is Mike Riley - a referee who had CLEAR bias for UTD during his time, and I'm not even exaggerating. You can go back and look up the games he's reffed for UTD. When such incompetent people are in charge of overlooking such important matters everything goes to shit. And in my opinion, 2003-2007 was one of the best eras for refs.

The Doctor cannot choose his appearance (at least until some future point). Remember the 5th Doctor made the comment that you never know what you're going to get. 

The 2nd Doctor's regeneration was instituted and controlled by the Time Lords.

true,zeeski,null,null,"Ha, I find Chelsea just as frightening (especially after the way you've won the window). As for your questions: 

&gt; What is your team biggest weakness?

The center of defence and a team wide sense of balance. Our centre-backs are often exposed in an individual sense; regardless of pairing or player, we've dropped points due to individual errors in cenral defence (see the end of our match at Stamford Bridge). And as for balance, we're significantly better with the ball than without it, and I'm not sure that's going to change any time soon.

&gt; Do you think Manchester City can win the UCL this season?

Yes, but I certainly don't expect us to. We'll have to beat Barca just to get to the other giants, and simple odds would say the more great teams you have to play, the harder it is to win a Cup. 

&gt; Would you consider it a ""failure season"", if your team fails to win the EPL title?

No, but I would still be disappointed if we didn't. We've only played one of the top seven away from Fortress Etihad and we lost that match (although to be fair, I think we deserved at least a point and only a ridiculously poor error lost us that point in the dying minutes). It's obvious that our current squad was constructed to win the Premier League on a yearly basis, but failure to do so in the first season of a manager who has never worked in England could hardly be classified as a ""failure season.""

&gt; Also do you think Arsenal can win the EPL title?

I certainly do, and don't understand how they can continue to be discounted. Sure, it'll be significantly harder if they don't buy this window (which I don't expect them to) but they've shown over the first almost two-thirds of the season that they deserve to be considered title contenders and with a couple of top results in the second half (wins against us or Chelsea for example) they could pip either of us to the title.

I don't think the players are likely to relent either because there is very good competition for almost every position and a few are off to the world cup so are likely want to go with a good run of games behind them.

Celtic need to start worrying about who they want to make money off of in the summer (forster, van dijk, possibly one of lustig ambrose or matthews as well as some players who are apparently surplus like stokes Kayal) as well as trying to get a first team and style of play sorted for the champions league qualifiers.
 The preparation should start as early as possible. If ledley and sammy aren't going to have any contribution to celtic beyond the end of their contracts then i dont see there being any sense in having them waste a spot in the team that could be used by balde, boerrigter, biton or johanssen. These players have something to gain by playing and will appreciate in value and confidence when the other two's contributions and worth to the team will probably evaporate after summer barring them resigning.

I think the undoing of celtic will be the pish pitches. There will be a game in the latter half of the season when we need to play on a potato field in 70mph winds against unreasonably large men pretending to be footballers and in those circumstances, I can see us dropping points. Maybe Ross County away or some other bollocks like that.

Context
White professionals only would be a majority excluding a minority from joining its group. Black professionals only is a minority within a majority meeting up.

Connotation
When I think of a black group meeting I think of civil rights groups and progressive causes. White only? I think of racist groups. I think most people share these connotations so would give much more critical scrutiny to a whites only group.

Objectives
These groups are often about sharing experiences faced by minorities in majority situations. This is a need that people in a majority may not have or share, so will have less need of a group like this.

Not saying there isn't any merit in discussing the purposes of different groups, but I don't think a whites only group is strictly equivalent to a blacks only group. Groups based around ethnicity as equivalent to a groups that meet where a minority with a shared experience/quality means that members can offer support and networking to one another.

Freiburg's an example of costs:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/20/freiburg_germany_dumps_openoffice/

&gt; In terms of browsers (like servers) opensource has already won...
&gt;
&gt; Only an idiot these days runs a non opensource browser. Chrome is opensource as is firefox.

*Chromium* is free; Chrome is not. Almost everybody running a non-free OS is running a non-free browser.

&gt; Opensource powers nearly every one of the largest online companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, ebay, etc. Even reddit runs on Linux.

Government uses open source, too. They have Apache servers, gov.uk's built in rails or some daft buzzword and some core bit of the NHS is running on some sort of Linux; do Oracle let you use anything other than their RHEL any more?

But Government isn't just ten desktops and an NIS server, and cannot be. They're using huge, bespoke and fairly un-reusable systems. And these should be built out of the best available software. Perhaps that's free, perhaps not. But the *best* option is the one that should be used, and that's where Amazon, Google, Facebook and eBay are; if the best tool for the job is non-free then they use that one.

Either way, the large costs are the consulting fees and the labour. They're *huge* compared to licensing fees and they're required for both free and non-free software. Generally they are greater for free software than for non-free. 

Even were it to not require re-training people and re-working systems dependent on extant software, a switch away from MS Office to LO in purely licensing terms is never going to confer huge savings.

Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert is weighing up a deadline-busting swoop for Bournemouth midfield gem Eunan OâKane.

OâKaneâs stock went through the roof with an outstanding display against Liverpool in the FA Cup that also alerted Norwich.

The former Everton trainee, 23, drew interest from Swansea and Fulham before Saturdayâs match.

OâKane, signed from Torquay 18 months ago, represented Northern Ireland at Under-21 level before switching allegiance to the Republic.

Boss Eddie Howe is ready to offer him an improved contract to keep him.

We have heard this game before haven't we? Rafa vs Parry. Rafa won that one (thankfully) but is Brendan strong enough to win this one against a guy who is making a shitload of money for the company. Let's hope so. 

My opinion of Ayre has always been tainted after reading Brian Reades book ""Epic Swindle: 44 months with two cowboys"" (if you haven't read it, do... A great insight to the state of the club under G&amp;amp;H). It gave me a huge impression that he dawdled and hung Rafa at the behest of G&amp;amp;H and Cristian fucking Purslow. That being said he seems to have brought in some massive sponsorship deals for us and I have no problem him staying on in a commercial capacity.  

BUT!! My problem with this man has always been the football side of things. Why is he sitting on the transfer committee? Is he setting these valuations? Brendan seems to think so.  He's a money man and the fact that he's the md means what he says goes. I think this hinders the whole ""committee"".

My point is we are so close to getting back into the champs league. We're currently decimated with injury and overly reliant on the two boys up top. Worst case scenario is we don't make 4th... And we lose Luis as a result. Now we miss out on champs league money 25-30mil last count and our ability to attract bigger players. Surely Mr. ayre can add those figures up and realize that pushing the boat out by an extra ""reported"" 2 or 3 million will be worth it in the long haul? 

I know this is my option based on newspaper and other reports but if it is otherwise the club should let us know. 

Sorry for the rant but we are so close to being back on track yet I just get the feeling mr ayre is holding us back slightly, hoping his huge balance sheets impress the owners.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Muphry's law***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s%20law) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Muphry's law** is an adage that states that ""If you write anything criticising editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written."" The name is a deliberate misspelling of Murphy's law.

&gt;Similar laws have also been coined, usually in the context of online communication, under names including **Skitt's Law**, **Hartman's Law of Prescriptivist Retaliation** (or The Law of Prescriptive Retaliation), **The Iron Law of Nitpicking,** and **McKean's Law**. Further variations state that flaws in a printed or published work will only be discovered after it is printed and not during proofreading, and flaws such as spelling errors in a sent email will be discovered by the sender only during rereading from the ""Sent"" box.

true,tusksrus,null,null,"&gt;I think their methods are sometimes so awful that they are encouraging people to ignore others in the street, which is not a good thing for the future of cities. When they pretend they know you or they pretend to be just looking for a conversation, etc, they are abusing the trust of strangers and taking advantage of kindness. That is obviously not good for society.

Personally I've not experienced this, but I don't doubt it happens. That's obviously not on.

&gt;But I don't want to have to say 'no' to them or avoid them phsically because it always feels bad to do that to another person who's asking you for something.

I think, considering how much worse off starving children in Africa (for example) are, having to politely say 'no thank you' to someone isn't such a blight on your life, honestly.

If you feel guilty, ask yourself this. *Can* you give money to charity? If not, you have nothing to feel guilty about. But if you're out shopping to buy the latest iThing and you literally give no money to charity at all, well, a bit of guilt will do you good.

I don't have a whole lot of money to charity, because I'm not the wealthiest guy, but I do give Â£8 a month to Save the Children, which is a fraction of what I could afford to give, frankly, but it makes me feel less guilty when I don't give money to a collector in the shopping centre.

If you already give money to charity, you have no need to feel guilty for not giving to them all. If you give to none, don't blame your guilt on the collectors.


edit: I just want to clarify, I don't know if collectors are the best or most efficient or most convenient way to raiser money for charitable causes.

I said that 16-17 year olds can rent a property. I mentioned *nothing* regarding the specifics of tenancy agreements. If you check my previous posts you will see that this is the case.

You claimed that 16-17 year olds could NOT rent a property. And to 'prove' your point, you posted a link that specifically mentioned tenancy agreements. 

I did not and have not disputed the fact that 16-17 year olds could not sign a tenancy agreement. However, according to Shelter's advice (which is where your Childline link suggested one go for more detailed advice), a 16-17 year old CAN sign a tenancy agreement as long as it is held in trust by the landlord.

My original and current claim, that you chose to dispute, was and is that 16-17 year olds could rent a property. I have proven that claim with both my link to Shelter's website, and the Citizen's Advice Bureau's site. If you feel that they are incorrect in telling 16-17 year olds that they CAN rent a property, please feel free to contact them and inform them of their mistake. You should also contact all those single mothers aged between 16-17 who live in their own rented homes that their rented homes are actually a figment of their and my imagination. But I suspect you're not going to do that.

So to recap:

Can 16-17 year olds legally sign a tenancy agreement? Not outright. But YES if it is held in trust.

Can 16-17 year olds legally rent a property? Yes

Can 16-17 year olds leave home without their parent or guardian's permission? Yes

Can 16-17 year olds claim housing benefit? Yes

One final point. You seem to have rather shifted the goalposts in your argument, so I encourage you to re-read my previous posts. Not once in any of my previous posts did I even suggest that 16-17 year old were legally regarded as adults. I simply said that you couldn't really regard them as children. You knowâ¦ kids. I have in fact, on a number of occasions made it clear that they are minors. Just not fucking children.

Oh, and as flattering as it was of you to suggest that I'm still a minor myself, I'm afraid those days are several decades behind me.

Further, people love to jack off about how well the commercial side is doing, and that is directly Ayre. Now, that doesn't mean that he knows his transfers, but surely we can *at least* trust him to sell prospective signings on the club, right?",0,1390874361,null,0,false,0,cf0kjqz,t3_1wbinn,t1_cf0kjqz,t1_cf0kexz,null,1432136870,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,bonesingyre,null,null,"I think you are grossly simplifying our attack.

Suarez and Sturridge are both DLF/Strikers. Aspas is their true backup but there is a huge different in quality at the moment.

Moses and Sterling are wingers and give depth to our attack.

Coutinho is our starting CAM and Alberto is his only backup.

Compare that with Manchester City:

Striker: Aguero, Dzeko, Negredo, Jovetic

Winger: Navas, Milner, Nasri, (Kolarov Wingback)

MF: Silva, Toure, Garcia, Rodwell.

They have at least 3 and mostly 4 deep in each position. There is plenty of overlap as the Wingers and MF can play both, but there is no denying that depth.

If Suarez and Sturridge are both injured, Our starting attack will be: Aspas, Moses, Sterling, Coutinho....Not exactly a fearsome attack.

Sure, you might say that MCFC spent millions to build that team but we could have built a quality attack for much less.

Do you really trust Aspas, Moses, and Sterling to be our future attack if Suarez and Sturridge are injured?

If we did, we might as well get rid of royalty and state religion altogether, and then we'd be stuck with President Boris and a rising tide of evangelical fuckwits hell-bent on forcing everyone to sing God Save The Righteous before every cuppa.

true,BenJoudarLFC,null,null,"Against Tottenham, we lined up with Sterling, Suarez and Coutinho as our three attackers. That game we did not use a CAM they were just attackers rotating positions. That left a bench of Moses and Aspas to do like for like swaps. That's 5 in a 4-3-3 formation without Sturridge.

There's no point in comparing us to Man City, they are out of our league in terms of quality, money and they are competing for the title. Take Everton, Spurs, UTD. All of them have One or two really good attackers, they all do out match us. Spurs have Lennon and Lamela on the wing, there back up of Chadli and Townsend which to be fair is better than ours. We have Sterling and Cout, with Moses as a back which isn't very strong, but there still is a potential of 3 players to come in. 

Midfield they have; Capoue, Sigurdsson, Eriksen, Dembele, Holtby, Paulinho and Sandro. 7 players to fill 3 spots on the field. Whereas we have 5.  

But if Tottenham lose Paulinho and Dembele they have a couple replacements in Capoue and Eriksen for example. Oviedo get's injured, they put in Osman. Kagawa doesn't get injured, UTD put in Mata. 

You also said what if Suarez and Sturridge both get injured, fair enough we would be in trouble. But if Tottenham lost Adebayor and Soldado they wouldn't have a first team striker, UTD lose Rooney and RVP they were stuck with Welbeck, Everton lose Lukaku and Mcgeady (both of whom are on loan) they don't have much in terms of replacement. Our attack overall is much deeper than our midfield.

4-3-3 is the preferred formation, we have 6 players that can play there. We have 5 for the 3 and again, 2 are injured and one is 20.

true,rydleo,null,null,"It doesn't work that way, sadly, although that would be far easier.  

The cost of a new player is amortized over the length of their contract as they are assets to the business, not liabilities.  If we take Andy Carroll:

Acquisition price:  35M

Length of contract:  5.5 years

Amortized value (per fiscal year) = 35/5.5 = 6.36M per FY (which is the amount Andy cost us per fiscal year as an expense)

We sold him for ~15.4M with three years to run on his contact, so his book value to the club was 6.36M x 3 = ~19M.  We also had to pay him a loyalty bonus of minimum 5% of the transfer fee so basically knock 5% off the ~15.4M for an actual gain of ~14.6M. 

So, for FY2013-2014, the club will have +14.6M in for Andy, -19M for residual book value, or roughly a -4M loss.  Since it's a rather large one time charge, I wouldn't be surprised to see it as an exceptional expense on the financial report.

true,szlafarski,lfc99,,"It's a really complicated system. Once BR and the scouts identify the targets, he presents the targets to Ian Ayre and FSG. 

From what I understand, the next step would be for FSG to recognize the player as a target worth going after. Ian Ayre and his guys then work to determine that player's value, approach the club with an enquiry and are either given a price or told the player is not for sale (or, perhaps both).

Ayre is then tasked with opening negotiations with the club. At this point, FSG will have approved the deal with the funds being made available. Should the other club want more money, Ayre negotiates to a price. THIS NEXT PART IS PROBABLY CRUCIAL TO WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING.

If they think that the player they are after is worth the asking price, Ayre will contact FSG and ask them to raise the ceiling on available funds for that player. He of course will need to convince them that he's worth the extra money, but at this point, they should already have been made aware by BR as to how significant the target is (he realistically wouldn't approach them without absolutely wanting the player).

If FSG agree to the price, they give Ayre the green light on the transfer. Ayre will then make an official bid, either the team accepts it and allows Ayre to open contract negotiations with the player, of they turn it down - unless a) a release clause is meg triggering negotiations with the player or b) the player submits a formal request to leave and it is approved.

If they DO NOT think the player is worth the extra money, they will try to negotiate further with the other club - bonuses, add ons for European appearances, additional appearances/minutes played/goals scored in the first year etc. Sometimes this works, sometimes it does not.

Keep in mind that this is crunch time - the press will have been made aware by now that enquiries and a bid have been made, and other teams (such as BVB, Tottenham, Chelsea) will see that we are in for a player they may have been looking at, and jump in to open their own negotiations,

In this case, Ayre/LFC will have been told that another team has offered more for the player. It is in that clubs best interest to let them know and open a bidding war - that way they are guaranteed to walk away with more money than they thought.

Again, if Ayre and FSG decide that want to meet the other bid or surpass it, Ayre makes the request to FSG, they approve it and they take it further. If they don't, they back off.

That selling club is allowed to accept multiple bids, however at that point it's down to the player to choose what they're going to do (as is the case with Willian and apparently Mkhitaryan). They were courted by the other teams, either with money, European game time, bonuses, charisma, charm or preference of environment and their role in the side.

With that being said, look at Chelsea and Arsenal, as an example. Those players they purchased (let's use Ozil as an example) were approached by the club. An enquiry was made by Arsenal to RM. For whatever reason, RM didn't want to open up a bidding war. Why's that? Well, it's one thing if John Doe the managing director calls you up, but when you get Arsene Smooth as Fuck Wenger on the phone, you are damn well listening. Arsene is fluent in server all languages - how awesome do you think Ozil felt when Arsene himself called him up and spoke to him in his native language about how much he admires him and wants him as a player.

Mourinho and Ferguson were known for the same thing. They're charismatic, confident, strong communicators. If you watched Being Liverpool you'll see that Ayre is good in a boardroom of business folk, but he isn't exactly Mr. Smooth. From what I've seen, if Brendan Rodgers was more involved in the way Mou, Arsene and Fergie were, I think we would see great success in our transfer dealings.

Even though he blew quite a lot of money, Damien Comolli was great at this. He swept Suarez off his feet, a player being looked at by MANT top, Champion's League clubs.

I did a business and language degree, so I don't know about how your course would be.  That said, I had a great time and I really enjoyed the uni.  You have a lot available to you - many libraries throughout the city, student union, helpful staff (usually).

Nightlife is good, I feel.  You have a lot of options in clubs and bars, pubs and restaurants.  Thursday used to be student night, and at Scream by the union you could get very very cheap drinks.  Gigs are plentiful and we have a great local music scene if you're into it.  Some kinds of music, especially electronic stuff, tends to be more available in Manchester.

As already stated, Grand Central is the best for meeting people and partying.  It is the most expensive, if I remember, though.  I lived at home and commuted up from the Wirral every day so I don't have much help for you here.  First year, go with an expensive Grand Central style accommodation, and if you're comfortable with some mates and want to move in together, look into Kensington or Toxteth.  They're slightly rougher neighbourhoods than the city proper, but full of students and cheap.

I had a fantastic time.  I wish I had lived in town with mates, but I have far less debt than many of my friends.  Liverpool is a cracking city, and I love it to pieces. 

My tip/advice would be to apply.  If you apply and don't get it, no harm done.  If you apply and are offered a place, you then have the power to choose what you want to do.  You need options before you can make a decision.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I was just answering your question and I think I illustrated that plenty of good players are moving this window (lots of them are already Champion's League quality players that I don't think would be completely opposed to our project, in fact they're the sort of players that would help us take the next step up and make it back to the big time).  To pick out a few that we probably could have had a really good shot at if we tried for them:

Squad players who we could use for immediate cover and then rotation later that moved this window:

Nocerino: He's been bad for Milan for a while now, but so has the vast majority of their team.  He's got some quality in him and he's a hard working, strong tackling midfielder.  He'd be fine short term cover and is still decent enough to have a role once everyone else is fit.  I'm actually pretty surprised he was open to a move to West Ham, I think he could have done much better for himself.  This will court controversy since he'd been such shit at Milan for so long, but Allegri really had all of his midfielders playing like garbage.  It's pretty hard to tell if it was Nocerino himself or the club's situation +- the manager's inadequacy. 

Guidetti: Perfect third striker to see out the season with, hungry to prove himself, and great for making sure Sturridge's glass legs don't break.  Hard to say if we'd have been able to really make this happen, but I doubt City sees us as a rival at this point so maybe.  He'll also get a lot more time at Stoke so no clue.  He's not a winger but I don't think that makes a particularly huge difference... our attackers need to be versatile and we like to have our flanks cutting inside anyway.  Lots of our width comes from our fullbacks in the attack.

Bastos: He's pretty damn good.  I don't think Salah is better than him (maybe he will be eventually, but not at current ability), he was beast for Lyon when they were at their peak.

This was established back in the Fourth Doctor story ""The Deadly Assassin"" as a plot device when the Master came back zombified and needed a new body, and because the founder of Time Lord society, Rassilon, saw Time Lords needed to be kept in check with the idea they couldn't live forever.

The Doctor regenerated 12 times, not 11. Yeah, it confuses me as well. 10 prevented his regeneration once because he was vain, and used the energy to only heal. He transferred the energy that would've physically changed his body into a hand he lost in a sword fight- which he regrew from the regeneration that created him, since it was still active for 15 hours. The ink hadn't set, if you will. Donna Noble accidentally gave the hand DNA while the regeneration energy was coursing through it. Her DNA filled in the missing gaps and allowed the energy to grow a complete body from the limb, making a Doctor with 10's face, and human/Time Lord hybrid DNA with a human lifespan and no regenerative abilities.

Then 10 really did regenerate and 11 was out of luck. But Clara convinced the Time Lords to give him another cycle of 12. 11 to 12 used up the first of that new cycle. So now he could go as far as a 24th Doctor before he runs out again. He has regenerated 13 times in total.

true,avro,,Famigilia Leeds United,"Picturing the scene at Costa - Watford Gap Service Station.

Big Sam has a triple shot venti latte in hand with whipped cream and chocolate dusting. His doctor doesn't recommend coffees after the heart-work but what, in the Big Man's thoughts, ""does that bloody jumped up surgeon moron know about football management?""

Brian slowly slides the Â£8 required for such an extravagant beverage across the table and lightly coughs, ""will that do you? Please leave my Ross McScormuch alone now, i'm under enough pressure as it is, what with all this fannying about by Sport Capital."" 

Big Sam peers from the lid of his coffee cup, whipped cream mustache adorning his top-lip and a smile breaks slowly across his face. ""Sure thing Dr. Eggman, we'll leave him alone now,"" raising his hand to his earpiece (worn at all times since Bolton days) he whispers something into a lapel microphone Brian can't quite make out.

 Messrs. Gold and Sullivan turn to look at the scene playing out in Costa from the WHSmiths across the way. They've been examining the top shelf rack of smutty lads mags snickering together like teenagers perusing a just found, damp and slightly soiled copy of ""Razzle"" under a hedge in Stratford. 

Sullivan pulls out his phone. Scrolling to ""Salad Noodleman"" in his contacts he texts one line ""...8 mil - take it or leave it,"" a grin smacking across his face as he hits send. He nods to Big Sam.

It dawns on Brian he's been shafted. His head drops and he slumps over to weep quietly. The tears fall lazily into his lukewarm Chai Tea.

Sam gets up, ""no hard feelings eggy it's just football"". Brian's sobs grow louder as Big Sam gets up and leaves, pausing slightly to consult the wimpy menu on his way out.

Do you honestly think most females haven't heard your advice a million times before and follow it every day? Are there less incidents of rape in countries where women have to cover up and not allowed to leave the house? Do you seriously most rapes occur because of girls wearing bugger all wandering down dark alleys late at night?

Most females do follow your advice, it is drilled into them from a very early age. It written into the friends code that you never leave your drunk friend to get home on their own. You text each other to let them know you got home safe etc etc. This is the world we live in every day, yet it doesn't seem to be working??

How about we just teach people not to rape and then maybe we wouldn't have to patronising go around telling victims how they should act in an effort to 'protect' them.

The fact is, regardless of how victims are dressed or how they act there will always people who prey on them.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***3753 Cruithne***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3753%20Cruithne) :

&gt;**3753 Cruithne** (/kruËËiËnjÉ/ or /ËkrÊnjÉ/) is an asteroid in orbit around the Sun in 1:1 orbital resonance with the Earth, making it a co-orbital object. It is a minor planet in solar orbit that, relative to Earth, orbits in a bean-shaped orbit that ultimately effectively describes a horseshoe, and which can transition into a quasi-satellite orbit. It has been incorrectly called ""Earth's second moon"". Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun. Its orbit takes it inside the orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Mars. Cruithne orbits the Sun in about 1 year but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around the Earth.
