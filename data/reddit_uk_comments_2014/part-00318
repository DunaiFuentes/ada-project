So I take it you hated the Bad Wolf, Torchwood, Saxon, and Stolen Planet Arcs? After all, you rarely learned anything before the finales in Rusty's time.

Series One: 

What we learned episodes 1-11: The phrase 'Bad Wolf' appears a lot.

What we learned episodes 12-13: Rose Tyler stared into the heart of the TARDIS and scattered her name across time for some reason became a god and the Doctor had to regenerate to save her.

Series Two: 

What we learned episodes 1-11: The phrase 'Torchwood' appears a lot. Torchwood is an organization created to fight aliens. Also, Cybermen were created on Earth instead in an alternate universe.

What we learned episodes 12-13: Torchwood is an organization created to fight aliens that isn't that relevant to the plot. Also, Cybermen are breaking through from the alternate universe and the Daleks come out of literally nowhere.

Series Three:

What we learned episodes 1-11: Some chap named Saxon is running for PM. Also, the Doctor isn't the last Time Lord, and Time Lords can hide their Time-Lord-Ness in pocket watches.

What we learned episodes 12-14: Saxon is really the Master who hid in the far future as a kindly old scientist and then became the Master again and stole the Doctor's TARDIS and regenerated, then traveled back in time to modern day, ran for PM, and unleashed evil humans from the future on the world after hacking the Doctor's TARDIS so that it allows paradoxes to exist.

Series Four:

What we learned episodes 1-11: Bees are disappearing. Planets have been stolen. Stars are disappearing. Also, the Ood say 'DoctorDonna', which we are led to believe to be a quirk of translation.

What we learned episodes 12-13: Davros was rescued from the Time War by an insane Dalek and wants to DESTROY THE UNIVERSE, and so he steals planets in order to do it, including earth. The insane Dalek who rescued Davros now hates the Daleks and has been trying to keep Donna and the Doctor together so that the Doctor will regenerate and not change by pouring energy into his hand, which Donna will then touch and turn into a half-human version of the Doctor and make her really smart. So that she and the Metacrisis Doctor can destroy the Daleks.

Series 8:
What we know so far: A woman called Missy is somehow getting dead people into a place she calls Heaven (or the Nethersphere). She's been trying to keep the Doctor and Clara together. The TARDIS doesn't like Clara. Robots and Cyborgs seem to be focused on the Earth, looking for the 'Promised Land.'

&gt;The __Gaia hypothesis__, also known as __Gaia theory__ or __Gaia principle__, proposes that [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) interact with their [inorganic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound) surroundings on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) to form a [self-regulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic), [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) that contributes to maintaining the conditions for [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) on the planet. Topics of interest include how the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) and the [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of life forms affect the stability of [global temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology), [ocean salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleosalinity), [oxygen in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen) and other environmental variables that affect the [habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability) of Earth.

Ivanovic was at his prime when he used to play CB, he's been with us with multiple Managers and has ALWAYS performed, at one point he was wanted by Real Madrid and probably Barcelona, that isn't down to Jose. I think I remember reading Jose wanted him at Real to partner Pepe.

Cahill wasn't brought into the Team by Jose, and again he was World Class which is why we bought him, he's still priming as a Professional Player, Cahill isn't even 30 yet.

Azpi won the Ligue 1 Title with Marseille I think? He was already a decent player but he was forced into the LB role and performed as he should have, otherwise why is he at Chelsea? I give credit to Jose for believing in him that's for sure.

Lukaku and De Bruyne would have become great with us, Lukaku had a waste of two years that he could have had with us developing, he's now going to develop with Everton. De Bruyne will develop in the Bundesliga and in years to come should become phenomenal.

Or the weird gravity scene with Courtney and the yo-yo, like why she suddenly floated cause the spider was nearby.

There was the egg-shell disappearing into nothingness after the alien moon was born, then the new egg being laid but there was no explanation offered as to how it was laid so quickly, or why it was bigger than the alien that laid it.

Or there were the characters, like those two old blokes who were literally just there to be killed by the spiders, who were just there to provide immediate threat and then forgotten about.

There was the scene where all the air is getting sucked out of the building, but then the random panel just patched up the hole in the door, normally that sort of issue is fixed by a character doing something but it was just weirdly fixed by a stroke of luck.

Then you've got the abortion thing, where the whole episode was about the women choosing if the egg should have the right to live.

Then to cap it all off Clara goes absolutely ballistic at the Doctor for letting her decide the fate of her planet, which just seemed unrealistic to me. 

Actually one final thing is the references to Tumblr that they used Courtney for, which was pretty much just unnecessary pandering, which maybe once in a while you'd let it go, but there were two or three occasions in the one episode.

The plot was so predictable that the ending was obvious as soon as the trees were revealed to be fireproof, and it was never actually explained how the trees managed to grow overnight. The Doctor mentioned some bullshit about time and trees containing a fragment of the year they're born in, but that doesn't explain how they popped up from solid concrete with no seeds or soil and grew to maturity.

Also, there weren't even any aliens to justify it. Apparently the trees just band together and do this for no reason. Maeve apparently summoned them, but she would have no reason to do so since she would have no way of knowing about the solar flare and they always saved the Earth in the past without human intervention.

In reality it just forces younger people to wait until they're 24 and pay for 1 set of lessons, tests, bike and insurance, and go straight in to that higher power bike because now they're 24 and earning more money.

It's completely ridiculous.

The only reason we had such a good last season was because we had less matches and Suarez. Plus all the teams played openly against us. Now they have figured us out and play defensive, because they know that we don't have any player that can score a goal. I don't even want to start about Balotelli and how useless he is right now, let alone sending him stranded out in front...for the I don't know which game in a row. We sold Suarez and got what? I don't see any of our signings having even a slight impact so far(I'll just point out as an example Costa, Lamela, Fabregas, Sanchez, Sakho(from West Ham). I really want us to improve, but that isn't gonna happen with Rodgers.

Besides what worries me most about UKIP is that they normalise both hateful ideas and ideological narrow-mindedness. Tolerance is not a natural thing for humans to do. We're naturally tribal especially when we are talking about people and things we don't fully understand or have any experience of. It takes a lot of effort to be decent to people we don't understand and when UKIP start to stir up people's natural intolerance to get votes (even if they don't say many intolerant things themselves) they make it acceptable to be nasty. It's part of a civilised society that we ridicule intolerant behaviour and the fact that UKIP seems to give that intolerance a respectable face is very scary because it becomes a cover for genuinely despicable people to develop. It's kind of like how Anjem Choudary is not an islamic extremist himself but the people that follow him develop extreme ideas in the groups he operates. 

In terms of narrow-mindedness this is the exact aspect of the US political debate that UKIP mirrors perfectly. Democrats call Republican's stupid and tear George Bush apart for the war on terror but are silent about Obama's escalation. Republicans rail at Democrats and consider them unpatriotic and dumb. No-one changes their opinion because they all believe the other side is the worst thing on the planet regardless of evidence. We had a similar sort of thing between the Conservatives and Labour but UKIPers seem the most set in their ways of any political group. They are convinced they are the subject of a smear campaign and that anybody that opposes them is a delusional, unpatriotic moron. It's only providing choice insofar as it give's people a greater variety of opinions to hold in the face of evidence. You can't have a debate with people who won't listen to anyone else.

Isn't my apparently missing the point of Twitter, the focus of this discussion? Lol.

&gt; especially with things like news and events

Reddit is my source for both funnily enough (not the actual information, just the knowledge that something happened slash is happening, and I need to go read about it on &lt;insert appropriate source here&gt;). You do have to have subscribed to appropriated Subreddits though, where as on Twitter things just ""trend"". I would have to give it that.

&gt; I'd be interested in how many Reddit comments are below 140 characters actually

That would be very interesting. I wonder is there any reddit-statistics sources?

&gt; obviously there's a lot that are detailed comments but a lot of this is meaningless shit too.

The shit can be meaningless a lot, but it TENDS to at least ""thread"". Some three word comment that basically boils down to a bad joke is a waste of pixels, but at least it relates to the overall topic of discussion normally. Even our friends the trolls tend to troll ""on topic"".

First, Hazard v Rafael/Jones. As we all know Hazard is positively destructive on his day, and I think if it's him v Rafael we're going to have a field day. At least one peno. However, Jones is a decent 1v1 defender and always seems to be the one to do the man marking (if Costa plays he's man marking Costa not Hazard though).

Second, Matic v Di Maria. Di Maria along with Aguero, and Hazard is one of the top 3 best players in the premier league (imo) and has the ability to win games single-handedly. That being said, I would argue Matic's case for best true defensive midfielder in the world at the moment, and I think how much he minimizes Di Maria's presence will be indicative of how this goes. 

Third, Oscar v Mata. I think Jose will key off of Mata's inability to deal with a physical press. Seen numerous examples of it this year, if he's pressured at a super high physical tempo, he struggles and doesn't win it back. Meanwhile, Oscar has orchestrated just about every press we've ever done this season and has the work rate of a fucking Ox. That being said, we all know how good Mata is on his day, definitely one to watch.

The bees disappearing and the stolen planets - again, separate things being mentioned in passing and not brought up until the end-of-season reveal.

Season 7, again, made it very very obvious that Clara was the focal point and that there were multiple of her throughout spacetime.

Example... every Polish person I've met has been lovely - anecdotal I know, but that's my experience. I worked in a factory once through an agency and I was literally the only English person there. Everyone else was Polish. Granted, the working conditions were terrible and I quit after a few weeks, but I respected the shit out of the Poles who stuck it out. The building was riddled with asbestos and there wasn't even a decent room to go and eat lunch in, let alone an actual canteen. A few months after I quit, the building was shut down and condemned.

If I have any problem with Poles, it's that they might not be asking for enough. If they want to work here, they ought to have higher expectations. But this also lies at the feet of employers who may take advantage of immigrant labour. People from other countries may have lower expectations than UK natives. UK natives don't want to share homes, or rent places. We want to pay for our own homes and live in them alone, because we were born into this country and want to stay and have the same lifestyle as our babyboomer parents, however impossible that is. Some immigrants may prefer to share houses and send money back to their families, because they know that's the reality.

It'll be unique for every person. Many immigrants are here to stay and want to live a good life here.

Nope, can only be used for people to stand trial, just straight up factually incorrect

* Save £55m a day in membership fees by leaving the EU 

Nope - ignores all the money we get back from Europe

* Develop shale gas to reduce energy bills and free us from dependence on foreign oil and gas

Nope, shale gas reserves are sufficient to cover maybe 20 years of our gas usage but doesn't consider oil/petrol/coal use.

And then in the ""obviously dumb or purely mean spirited"" category

* Proof of private health insurance must be a precondition for immigrants and tourists to enter the UK. 

But isn't tourism a major part of the UK economy and wouldn't we be one of the only countries in the world to require health insurance for all visitors?

*  Prioritise social housing for people whose parents and grandparents were born locally.

Seeing as we have a shortage of social housing already, if your grandparents weren't born here, no housing for you. Just to repeat, that's your grandparents not being **born** here as a source of prejudice against you. My grandparents were born over a hundred years ago and that would be a cause to deny me social housing today if they had been born in another country.

* Teach children positive messages and pride in their country.

That's the opposite of being British.

Labour are weak, faceless opposition, the Tories are doing an identifiably poor job in government, and the Lib Dems are simply being shown to have no kind of influence within the coalition, failing to make any headway on the few policies that actually saw their surge of support to put them in the kingmaker role.

Idk if I’m just stretching things but it’s the vibe I get from some of the lines the doctor said. 


     If she had depression instead and the doctor said “you’re depressed and you want to make yourself happy” it would’ve been the same thing. The doctor implied that we should listen to the voices instead of medicating; well should we be depressed instead of happy because it’s meant to be? Any mental illness could be substituted there.

&gt;The known __Economic history of India__ begins with the [Indus Valley civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_civilisation). The Indus civilization's economy appears to have depended significantly on trade, which was facilitated by advances in transport. Around 600 BC, the [Mahajanapadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahajanapadas) minted punch-marked silver coins. The period was marked by intensive trade activity and urban development. By 300 B.C., the [Maurya Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire) united most of the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent). The political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity.

You are right that the electromagnetic waves would have already reached the earth, but they wouldn't fry us, just our electronics.  The largest solar flare in all of Earth's history might have killed the cell towers, might not have.  Solar flares don't really affect us much.

Yes, the trees blocking a solar flare is bollocks, but that's not what blocked the flare.  The trees pumped out a ton more oxygen into the atmosphere (where did it all come from, I wonder) and that, supposedly, protected the planet.  The science is kinda there.  The reason that Mars doesn't have a thick atmosphere is because solar flares ripped it away.  Earth has a strong magnetic field that protects our atmosphere.  It's possible that the solar flare was too strong for the magnetic field and the extra oxygen was enough to pad our atmosphere.  The extra oxygen would have been ripped away by the flare.  Granted, that probably means that the ozone layer is completely gone, leaving the planet to die from the normal radiation from the sun.

Trees do have moving parts, but not in a mechanical sense when most normal people speak of moving parts.  We've known for a while that the Sonic Screwdriver doesn't work on wood.  I think they've been trying to explain that recently.  In The Day of The Doctor they say the door is too primitive.  In this episode, the trees don't have electronic parts.  I think the writers are trying to get away from the Sonic's weaknesses being specifically wood and dead locks and replacing it with the more general ""not electronic"" (a good thing in my opinion).

The EU is pro-Corporate and anti-democratic. I want to leave. 
I don't believe bigger government is better. Our politicians seem more interested in waving their dicks about on the world stage, with Billions of our taxes, than they do of managing the country they're employed to run. 

I've been around for a while now and I can tell you it's always been the same, ever since I was a child, when we only had electricity for three days a week. Politicians are generally a shower of self serving shit and we need some fresh blood and some sackings to take place. A good shake up. We also need to leave the EU so we can make our own decisions for our own benefit. 

We are in the top 10 richest countries in the world. We don't need to be tied to a failing, dangerously expansionist, super-state.  If the economy suffers a little, which I honestly doubt it will, well, GDP isn't everything.  
The Tories are supposedly offering a referendum, so the financial markets will take a hit if that ever happens anyway.

There's some really good people in UKIP. They're not all toff, pre-manufactured politicians, If you could be arsed to have a look you'd perhaps see differently. If you don't like them because you like to believe all the media headline crap, as it justifies your position, then you probably won't. It's really a bit lazy to pull out an idiot or two, who's been kicked from the party, or was a Tory, then try to portray all UKIP like that. Not that I'm saying they are perfect of course, what is?

For example, the 'gay floods man'. He was a Tory when he said that, he defected to UKIP, then it was in the media headlines that he was a UKIP councillor. He was then kicked from the party. I do sometimes wonder why other people, many of you on here, can't see that they're being spoon fed bullshit by the media via the current establishment. Maybe it's something you acquire with age and experience of politicians.

But then, what do I know, I'm probably just a grumpy old white man who doesn't know anything, or is stupid.

Here are some references that I picked up in the episode and the trailer. Anybody agree or disagree, or have other thoughts to offer?  I’m not using these to argue good or bad episode but to find past and future story arc tie-ins. I’m still working on the Missy versus Clara part in this.

(1) The tiger in the forest – between the title and the tiger, if you goggle its meaning there are cross references in the poem that could be applied.

Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies, Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare seize the fire?

(2) Bad Wolf versus the Impossible Girl – follow the progression below.

Girl in the red hoodie jacket and the wolves in the woods –&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- little red riding hood and the big Bad Wolf –&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- Bad Wolf and Rose in her Bad Wolf scattered throughout time last incarnation during the Day of the Doctor -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- setting Clara up for her last appearance as a scattered throughout time last incarnation of the Impossible Girl.

(3) And finally,

Fires of Pompeii reference to “can’t save everyone but can save some”.

Handguns were generally only licensed for target shooting purposes, meaning use at a suitable range only. Hunting with handguns and owning them for self defense wasn't legal. The only slight exception to the rule of handguns being for range use only is the provision for handguns to be used for humane dispatch and pest control purposes.

USA has the worlds largest economy, yet it doesn't even give away healthcare. 

Having the worlds largest economy, doesn't mean it's a good economy, nor does it mean it's a secure economy. If it wasn't for Birtain introducing global trade, it wouldn't be long till somebody over took India and India's economy began to collapse, you still have to modernize and change with the times. Same thing is happening with America right now, it's not changing with a rapidly changing world and it's starting to feel that. 

And having the largest economy doesn't mean it's a big economy, either. Sure Americas economy is the largest, but it fails to bring in soft-power, as it's so dependent China, it fails to bring down inflation and it fails to bring down deficits and debts. Economics is a little bit more complicated than saying ""thats the biggest"", India's economy was the biggest, but it was by far not the strongest, not even close to the most globalized and very far away from being the most secured. The fact the majority of their citizens are sat in a shack in their own piss and shit shows that.

Also, it depends on how you define economics, again, sure you might have the biggest, but it doesn't mean it's the biggest. USA has the largest in term of how much it makes, but if you divide it up among it's citizens, then it's only the 4th largest, hence why smaller countries with strong economies, tend to be very desirable places to live.

I liked that it was once again a character study. The part about the trees was a sub-plot. It was more about the Doctor and how he interacts with those around him - which I feel is very much the point of this season. I wasn't a fan of the ""magical thing talking through the kid"" thing, it was too much ""Fear Her"" and the Isolus, and I've never been a fan of that kind of thing. And I'm just going to forget about the ending.

The bulk of the episode was alright, though. For all the people criticising the ""shining a light in the tiger's eye"" thing, what he did was actually a thing: he wasn't just shining it, he was rapidly wobbling it back and forth, making a strobe effect. This is something that is actually used to disperse crowds and quell aggression - it fucks with the visual cortex and causes confusion and disorientation. In human/weapon application it's called a [PHASR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personnel_halting_and_stimulation_response_rifle), and was actually a nod to Danny's military background - of course he'd know about something like that. It's quite effective, and the earlier version of the tech was banned by the UN until they found a way to make the blinding and disorientation temporary. Yeah, it uses lasers, but a super-bright torch can achieve the same effect.

&gt;The __personnel halting and stimulation response rifle__ (__PHASR__) is a prototype [non-lethal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-lethal_force) [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) [dazzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzler_(weapon\)) developed by the U.S. [Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense). Its purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a target. Blinding laser weapons have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN [Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_on_Blinding_Laser_Weapons), which the United States [acceded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties) to on 21 January 2009.  The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, can skirt this regulation, as the blinding effect is apparently temporary. It also uses a two-wavelength laser. The PHASR was developed at [Kirtland Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base), part of the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Research_Laboratory) [Directed Energy Directorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Research_Laboratory#Directorates) in [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico).

To add some of my calm opinion: I think the show went downhill. As it became more popular, it got more budget. Larger audience. Show gets dumbed down. It's really quite simple and it happens everywhere. Trying to cater to everyone and thereby catering to no one. Everything's just a superficial blob that doesn't require much thought. Combine that with the decision that this season aimed to be more episodic and you end up with something I only watch because it's what you do if you're hooked already.

But I think that's a huge issue for us. It's strange. Looking at our lineups, one would think we'd put 40 shots on goal. However, especially when Ade's at the helm, we tend to get up toward the goal and kick the ball around until it's picked off. I'm looking for Bobby to make some of those beautiful passes to Nacer, Christian, and Coco. Hopefully, Mason can play us through and Bobby can get a good shot on goal. 

I'm most worried about our back line. Even against Asteras, we let so many balls into our final third, it was absurd. That's why Poch looked so pissed the whole game. I don't know if we're just playing to high up the pitch, but the back four consistently let players walk through them, the Arsenal game notwithstanding. 

I'm hoping we can have more cohesion in the back. I'm not sure who to blame for this, either. Is it the CBs fault? Not sure. Sometimes, it obviously is. But often, it'll be Rose and Dier high up the pitch. I can't fully blame them either, because it seems like that's part of Poch's system. 

Who fucking knows. 

All I know is that WE'RE GOING TO FUCKING CRUCSH NEWCASTLE!!!!!!!!!

We have new talent that will take a while to settle in, though if I'm honest, I'd hoped that Lallana would have been further along than he is. I find it really funny how obsessed with Balotelli this sub has become. He is not our answer, he wasn't brought in to solve our offense. That was pretty clear. And yet he's sort of to blame for everything apparently. 


Our defense hasn't improved - Skrtel has stayed consistent I think, but Lovren has struggled to settle. Sakho's dust up hasn't helped either. When Srktel and Lovren play together, it seems like there is still a concerning lack of communication and understanding. 


We have a stuttering offense set on a bad defense. Once we get some confidence or momentum going, we can and will improve offensively, hopefully enough to push for a Top 4 finish. What's working in our favor is that teams other than Chelsea and City have mostly also been shit.

The whole story, and the “Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night” poem that is interwoven throughout it, could be taken as a morality play on what is good and what is evil. What, or who (not a pun), is good and evil?  When does this change and why?  It’s preparing us for deciding the nature of good and evil, and for judging if the Doctor, or Clara, or Missy are more good or more evil.

This episode was full of fairy tale references that played into the Doctor's statement that humans forget the facts of a catastrophe and turn it into fairy tales (or myths or biblical scripture) to get rid of the fear.  Or because they don’t understand the science that caused a catastrophe (like the asteroid strike that caused the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah) so the evils of man, or man’s being judged as not good, must have caused it.

And the sudden appearance of the forest makes me think of “The Sound of Thunder” a time travel movie based on a Ray Bradbury story.  Due to the inadvertent killing of a butterfly in the past evolution on Earth changes overnight and primeval forest overtakes the cities.

There was a “save the forest burn the brush reference” at the end of Flatline. And there was a bit of an environmental message at the end about limited resources and unlimited population.

And I liked the little marching ditty from Danny the soldier. It reminded me of my military days in another lifetime.

A 14 hour shift means in that 24 hours period, the maximum number consecutive hours of rest you can take is 10. 

However, there are exceptions to this like certain shift work, then it gets kinda complicated and you have to start working out average hours worked per week over a 17 week period, taking into account 1 full days rest per week averaged over 2 weeks. There's probably some loophole that gets you around it.

Incorrect. The Church of the Silence was what the Papal Mainframe became to make sure that the Doctor didn't re-introduce Gallifrey to the universe, not by killing him, but by locking the planet down and threatening war.

However, they were still the good guys because they were trying to prevent the recurrence of the Time War, which is why the Doctor sided with them and fought against all the other aliens trying to force him to answer (or kill him so he couldn't).

However, the Kovarian Chapter (who also called themselves The Silence but weren't endorsed by the Church) decided that this wasn't enough, and travelled back along his timeline to try and kill him to prevent the whole problem from occurring altogether. However, this created the very problem they were looking to prevent, as it led to the TARDIS exploding and cracking existence - the very crack that Gallifrey was set to return through was caused by this.

The Silents themselves (the aliens) are actually Confessional Priests, genetically engineered for you to forget them (and presumably, your guilt and sins) after you speak to one.

Of course that catch to that is you could argue that by not resolving the issue, they would potentially travel into an parrallel-universe where they never solved the issue until they come up with a solution to that problem and jump back into the original universe.

His goal seems to be that he wants to write a mystery. But feels the need to ensure that dedicate fans can't work out his story line. So we end up with Wibbly Wobbly Timey Whimey, When he does something so he can pull bullshit out of his arse.

Fact is unravelling a mystery is something fans like to do. But the problem is you only unravel that mystery once. And if it feels like you've pulled some bullshit at the end then it comes off as a negative. Same reason everyone was dissapointed at the end of lost. As much as they went way too far with things. The fact that the writers were making mystery without knowing where they were going with it ruined it.

So to does capping it off with a Giant leap in logic or setting something up and then handwaving the negative aspects you were hyping

If the BBC spends more time marketing Doctor Who than American companies do their shows, it's out necessity. The baseline viewing audience and cultural reach of Doctor Who is much, much smaller than for an American show.

Plus, Doctor Who does not need a larger budget. The story quality is a consequence of competent scripting, imaginative plotting, and good performance, not lengthy CGI action sequences which are universally dull, unimaginative and against the spirit of the show.

It's all the same, just a matter of scope. Episode, season, the whole show... So when I say ""two or three episodes"" that is very much about their importance to the season as a whole. And, really, what happened... Doctor regenerated, you may want to see that. So lets start with the first episode. It introduces Missy as well. We'll see about the importance of Mr. Pink. But let's just add ""Listen"" to the mix since it's a good episode as well. The rest of the episodes... In the overall arc they seems to be nothing but unimportant scenes that may or may not entertain and show some (often inconsistent) character development at best. I'd go as far as saying that the missy scenes are pretty unimportant once you've seen about two.

So I am really hoping that a lot of hidden things will become important in the finale. Otherwise the season would be like an episode that could have been cut down to 10 minutes.

What you can get so easily is it's running in a visualised environment (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Containers), I don't know enough about Solaris or how that box is set up to tell you which mechanism of virtualisation is being used. Thing is the machine, although beginning to age, is still vastly over resourced, it could very easily be visualized into a normal virtual machine in the ""magic-box"".

The ""magic-box"" is real, it practical terms it's 18 magic boxes, 4Tb RAM, 264 cores all running VMWare vSphere ESXi. We started visualization before Hyper-V even existed, so we've stuck with what we know. The vast majority of services we (ISS) run are on the ""magic-box"" (beginning to like that term).

There's no public information on it because it's not really a public service in that regard, though any department can request a virtual machine on it, but it's not like EC2, you don't just get an account and spin up a new instance, it's a bit more... managed (forms, approval, resource allocation, etc).

We're also running a separate large (though not quite as large as ISS') ""magic-box"" for SCC, I can't see the stats for that one, which coming to think of it I probably need to be able to log into that to disconnect machines. It's purpose is research, so in theory SCC staff and research students can just get a VM and go. They might be teaching undergrads off of it too in the future, we've done similar things in the past.

As for the HPC (formally known as HEC), that's 16 racks of servers and disks, stuffed full of cores and in some cases GPUs, I have no idea of the actual stats of it, but it's certainly in the thousands for cores and probably 100Tb's of RAM. I do know the most recently procured nodes are connected at 10gbps, not for bandwidth but for low latency, in the HPC you start caring about the nanoseconds of data in transit.

LU doesn't own what some might call a traditional supercomputer, it's all discrete computers with clumps of cores, working with job scheduling systems and a high bandwidth/low latency network to move the data about.

It is present in newer [OpenSolaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris) based distributions, such as [OpenIndiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenIndiana), [SmartOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmartOS) and OmniOS, as well as in the official Oracle [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system\)) 11 release.

&gt;A Solaris Container is the combination of system resource controls and the boundary separation provided by *zones*. Zones act as completely isolated virtual servers within a single operating system instance. By consolidating multiple sets of application services onto one system and by placing each into isolated virtual server containers, system administrators can reduce [cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership) and provide most of the same protections of separate machines on a single machine.

As for things to do, make sure you visit the Joseph Wright gallery at the museum as it is recently been given a new status and is recognised as being of national importance.

Beer. Derby does beer particularly well so make sure you visit the real ale pubs in the city. It isn't hard to find the good ones but I recommend The Exeter Arms, The Greyhound, The Dolphin and The Furnace.

I'd also suggest taking in a football match at The Ipro Stadium. Sports events in the UK have a different atmosphere to those in the US so it's good to go along and soak up a different atmosphere.

Use Derby as a base to head out into the Peak District. Visit towns likes Bakewell (probably the best), Matlock Bath, Wirksworth and Ashbourne. See the great country estates in the county; Chatsworth (one of the best in the UK), Kedleston Hall and Calke Abbey are all worth a visit. 

EDIT: missed out Alton Towers although it depends when your are visiting as to whether to not it is open. Castle Donnington has a racetrack which might have some events on if you like motorsports.

I don't know much about this one, but what happens if a citizen is brought to trial in a country that doesn't have such a stringent justice system as ours? I'm assuming this is where the concern comes from.

&gt;Save £55m a day in membership fees by leaving the EU

Regardless of how much we get back in rebates, this money is the membership bill and the equivalent of £55 mil a day *does* leave the UK. Kind of like when you buy a £500 TV and maybe get £100 cashback in a week, the £500 still left your account.

&gt;Develop shale gas to reduce energy bills and free us from dependence on foreign oil and gas

I think you're being pedantic. We can't be 100% reliant on ourselves, but shale gas can minimise our reliance on other countries significantly.

&gt;Proof of private health insurance must be a precondition for immigrants and tourists to enter the UK.

How is this 'obviously dumb'? Do you buy travel insurance when you travel abroad? It covers medical expenses. You shouldn't even travel in Europe without travel insurance, just google Spain and the European Health Insurance Card. They've been refusing free treatment even if you're presenting an EHIC. We're in the process of bringing them to court, but even if found guilty there are things the EHIC doesn't cover such as mountain rescue.

Difference is the UK won't ask for a credit card before we treat you like the US etc. If you are travelling here and use the NHS, you are supposed to pay the money back but we have no reliable way of getting back the money. Charging for medical services is standard practice abroad, why not here?

&gt;Prioritise social housing for people whose parents and grandparents were born locally.

London is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, but we don't ask people in council houses there to move to Scotland. My understanding is that use of the word 'locally' is in a specific area and the parent thing here is to allow family to live near each other.

It is already the case that [no local connection](http://www.searchmoves.org.uk/scheme6.aspx) puts you in a lower priority band, so if you feel so strongly why not start a petition, because it's already happening.

 [**The Silence**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The%20Silence): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;The Silence allied with Madame Kovarian, the Church and the Order of the Headless. They were behind the Battle of Demon's Run and the kidnapping and brainwashing of the infant River Song, then known as Melody Pond. (TV: *A Good Man Goes to War*) She later made several attempts on the Eleventh Doctor's life. Ultimately, she kissed him with poisoned lipstick. She later broke free of her conditioning and revived him using the remainder of her regenerative energy. (TV: *Let's Kill Hitler*)
&gt;The Silents were encountered by the Doctor in 1969 America. The Silence had been on Earth since humanity's beginning, secretly manipulating humanity and its development for their own ends.
&gt;It was implied they were responsible for the Moon landing because they needed a special spacesuit for Melody Pond. The Silence's occupation of Earth was broken when the Doctor issued a post-hypnotic command via the Apollo 11 footage to the entire human race, instructing them to kill the Silents on sight. (TV: *Day of the Moon*)

Other things worth mentioning: They're having a new library built, which promises to be an improvement on the old one. Not that there was anything terribly wrong with the old one, but study space was an issue. 

Everything is close together on campus, which is very convenient, but you also have great access by rail to Birmingham City centre for nights out, shopping etc.

Most of the accommodation, private or university owned, is within walking distance of the university, and it's also a very pretty uni campus. Lots of red brick, trees, grass, flowers etc. Not to mention the largest free standing clock tower in Europe. The only real blot is the Muirhead Tower...

It's not just that Danny is ""the jealous boyfriend""; he's a self-righteous, condescending know-it-all who constantly plays the life experience card ""because he's been in the army"" (even when it has nothing to do with the topic, as in last night's episode). He puts himself in the role of the knowledgeable man and treats Clara like a naive child, even though in all likelihood she's done at least as many heroic things in her travels with the Doctor and seen much more than him. The worst thing is, the writers seem to intend all this to be understood at face value. They've had many chances to call him out on his bullshit; they never did. Instead a number of episodes pretty much ended with Danny given the chance to present his undisputed ""moral of the story"". As a result it's the writers who treat Clara condescendingly, giving more value to the off-screen exploits of a self-proclaimed soldier (seriously, Danny Pink must be the least believable army vet to ever grace the TV screen) than the combined experience of everything the Doctor's companion has been through. There's really nothing in Danny for Clara to fall in love with, other than his looks of course. We are constantly reminded (through words, mind you) that they are in love, but the their romance is just about as credible as Danny's military past. It is actually very telling that the only thing Danny has done to prove himself on a show that's always been about the strength of character was a slo-mo somersault.

Sorry for the rant, but I really hate... not Danny himself (I think you can only hate a character when they're well written, albeit annoying) but everything the Danny Pink character stands for as a symbol of how bad the writing has gotten on Doctor Who this season.",0,1414319852,null,0,false,0,clk36kx,t3_2kbbud,t1_clk36kx,t1_cljvxrv,null,1426345356,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

When you start shopping in Waitrose, JS and M&amp;S you start to see a huge rise in sustainability.

The difference is not in the written policy, they all have detailed sustainability policies in place.

Where it really strikes home is the audit process that each company goes through.

Audits are expensive, they take time and result in uncomfortable changes for suppliers.  But they do increase standards.

M&amp;S, for example, will do a full audit annually on all their suppliers, and will list the suppliers that manufacturers can use (eg fish processors will have to buy from prescribed m&amp;s listed fishermen).  Fail the audit and you will have to put corrective actions in place prior to the next production run, or an agreed timeframe.  For M&amp;S this can lead a product to be off the shelf for weeks, expensive but worth it to maintain quality an reputation.

Look at the players he brought in. The only kind of successful players are Cou and Sturridge which again compared to the other teams(ex.Chelsea, City, Real, Barca, Bayern) are substitutes. If you are going in with the mentality that Hull is equal to our standard or the standard that we are trying to reach, then the results are fine. I'd like to think that Liverpool are better than that and can be better. 

Hull drew Arsenal, because Arsenal scraped whatever fit players they had. If they played any stronger team, that was a sure defeat. Don't judge our game only from looking at the table.

I LOVED last week's episode 'Flatline', it was great! Small scale, Clara as a character was amazing, it was funny, it was less predictable than the majority of this series. 9/10 etc etc.
Now, we have 'In the Forest of the Night' - it was far from good. From the amazingness of last week's episode, this, crashes and burns so so hard. Back to that cancerous school, with lead spastic Danny Pink making an unwanted comeback, what a waste of a character... Oh, and we're back to the world being in peril again, good concept of story, but altogether, HORRIFICALLY BAD. 
Every. Single. Joke. Made. Missed the mark for me. The banter was grating. And the little girl, Maebh, (although possessing an awesome name which I would give to my hypothetical daughter in an instant) barely stood-out in the episode, she definitely needed more screen-time to set up her story and character for it to be effective. (I think of Merry in The Rings of Akhaten). And I'm sure the writer would have done this in the original script... before it was bastardised by Moffat. 
The CG eyes of the wolves in the foliage, LOOKED LIKE PICTURES... I MEAN, COME ON...
Robot of Sherwood, is vying for 'the worst episode I have ever seen' - bad story, badly executed.
In the Forest of the Night, is barely ok story, badly executed.
Ergo, I can't give it the 0/10 that I would want to give it, so I shall settle for 3/10. Not worth watching. It's like Moffat is trying to win back the Russell T Davies crowd, by making it periodically exponentially more and more crap.
And honestly, what is with the dangerous messages in the episode? - if you hear voices, listen to them... what. the. hell. 
So... disembodied voices speak to me; now after Doctor Who, I'm going to listen to them, and am, going, to, kill, all, of, my, friends. 
Also, the last scene is the most predictable thing ever, which I hate.
I'm just annoyed because, Capaldi is amazing, Coleman has proven herself to be amazing, Frank Cottrell Boyce, the writer for this episode - is a good children's writer, so it's not like I'm looking for something overly complex here, but the blame must be placed on someone... someone like, say, Moffat... Who I daresay would have written in the appearance of a damn tiger for no reason at all. I think it's time for the Doctor Who industry to stop being so tryhard and big-budgeted, and maybe remove the 1-story-per-episode crap... - where we can have great stories actually executed REALLY WELL... and give Maebh the character development that she deserves, leading to the reappearance of her sister at the end, to actually mean something.

&gt; Nato forces mistakenly **supplied food, water and arms to Taliban forces** in southern Afghanistan, officials today admitted.
Containers destined for local police forces were **dropped from a helicopter into a Taliban-controlled area** of Zabul province.

&gt; MI6′s meetings with the Taliban took place **up to half a dozen times** at houses on the outskirts of Lashkah Gah and in villages in the Upper Gereshk valley, to the north-east of Helmand’s main town. The compounds were **surrounded by a force of British infantry** providing a security cordon.

&gt; In August 2007, the presidents of Afghanistan and Tajikistan walked side by side with the U.S. commerce secretary across a new **$37 million concrete bridge** that the Army Corps of Engineers designed to link two of Central Asia’s poorest countries.

&gt; Today, the bridge across the muddy waters of the Panj River is carrying much more than vegetables and timber: It’s **paved the way for drug traffickers to transport larger loads of Afghan heroin and opium** to Central Asia and beyond to Russia and Western Europe.

&gt; The U.S. is investigating allegations that some **officials in the Afghan Air Force, which was established largely with American funds, have been using aircraft to ferry narcotics and illegal weapons** around the country, American officials told The Wall Street Journal.

&gt; The United States has paid more than **$150 million to companies in Afghanistan that are accused of helping to finance terrorist attacks** on American soldiers and facilities, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). **A list of 43 companies** in Afghanistan was compiled using data from both classified Pentagon investigative reports and Commerce Department lists of terror-connected companies.

&gt; Of particular concern was cargo ramp No. 5 at the airport, **where unscheduled aircraft were landing late at night and cargo was being unloaded in a hurry**, several Western officials said.

&gt; The airport is a joint civilian-military facility. **Unlike in most of the airport, the U.S.-led coalition has no oversight role at ramp No. 5**. A Western official called that cargo-loading area the **“Grand Central station of illicit activities”** in Afghanistan.

Most of our fans think that if we are going to beat you at some point this season, it will be around now while both teams have been misfiring somewhat. That said, the majority of people I've talked to are predicting a Tottenham win by a decent margin (3/4 goals) as we have just been so dire and with you having been so impressive in the Europa League during the week.

We've scraped our first win against a terrible Leicester side with a goal from Obertan but other than that we haven't put in a single decent League performance this year.

Our defence do terribly against any kind of pace but Janmaat on the right should keep your winger tied down there. If Steven Taylor plays as he did last week he might manage to take one of your strikers out of the game for at least a short period of time. 

If we are going to get anything from this match it will be on a counter-attack as we played that strategy quite effectively against Leicester. I wouldn't expect much though: if you score one goal our heads will drop and it will get a lot easier for you unless Cisse has one of his goal spells as he did against Palace and Hull.

But with balo, when the wingers are moving centrally to pick the ball(due to the rotation you mentioned) and balo doesnt move out wide. So we have an overload centrally and hence end up being narrow. You can also look to the FBs to provide the width in such situations, but the team has not developed the understanding yet for the FBs to bomb-forward and expect the pass.

My main problem with game yesterday was the number of times we did not to triangles to move the ball forward.

Halloween is mainly a kids' holiday, so you might get a few trick or treaters if there are a lot of kids around the area where you live.  They're probably absolutely love it if you were dressed up or something, but that's mostly because it's so out of the norm.

As for adults, a lot of universities will have a fancy dress Halloween party, and so might a few bars and clubs near you, depending on where you live, but it's not a big event everybody takes part in like it is in the US.

If you wanted to hold a fancy dress party in your home for Halloween, everybody would know what you were talking about, but your British friends might take a bit of encouragement to fully take part.  It tends to be one of those situations where people protest a lot, but many will enjoy themselves once they're actually doing it.  Don't expect them to put the kind of money, time and effort into their costumes as some of the American redditors seem to though, a long black dress, witch's hat and face paint is about as far as most Brits are willing to go.  It's the kind of thing that becomes tradition after a couple of years though, if you want to be that person who holds a party every year.

By the way, around a similar time of year, we have Guy Fawkes' Night (AKA Bonfire Night) in the UK.  There are usually two types of celebration, a big public one organised by the council with a massive bonfire, fair, and professional fireworks display, and a private, slightly shittier but much more fun one in someone's back garden with a firepit if you're lucky and the men getting progressively bolder and more dangerous with the fireworks as everybody gets more drunk.

I'm trying to locate the original study, because Eurostat data seems to contradict their findings

[Low-wage earners — employees (excluding apprentices) earning less than two thirds of the median gross hourly earnings, 2006 and 2010 (1) (% of employees) ](http://i.imgur.com/iyT8l3O.png)

Germans are slightly more likely to. Maybe the difference is in Eurostat's exclusion of apprentices? if anyone finds the original report, please let me know, I'd like to have a look at it.

&gt; A growing rump of low-paid jobs also presents a financial headache for the government because it fails to boost the tax take and raises the benefits bill for working people.

This, I think, is a key issue.

Delivering her after she ran away?  As soon as I saw that scene, I realized that it was nothing more than excess sentimentality.  If the girl had somehow heard her sister's call and returned of her own volition, it would have been a thousand times better than the unexplained relationship that she had with the fireflies.  Did she run off after they drove her into hearing voices, as well?  Where's she been hiding?  Guess we'll never know.

Seeing Clara order the Doctor away, ordering him to let children die was also a pretty horrific bit of writing.  Like he said, this is his planet.  I don't believe that he was actually going to listen to her, but come on.. ordering him to turn his back on Earth, leading him to actually leave in the TARDIS?  Ridiculous!

And it is suddenly okay for Clara to lie to kids about being gifted to make them feel better?... I was just starting to like her more in recent episodes.  Well, this, along with her continual lying to everyone else has left me pretty bummed about her character.

There is a procedure for using your rent to pay for repairs and to take the matter in to your own hands so to speak. 

In case the link is blocked at work for example...

The steps are:

Step 1 – report the repairs to your landlord. It's best to do this in writing and give your landlord a reasonable time to do the work. Keep a copy of your letter or email.

Step 2 – if nothing happens, write to your landlord again telling them that you will do the repairs yourself unless they arrange for the work to be done. Keep a copy of your letter or email.

Step 3 – allow a further reasonable period of time for your landlord to do the work. If nothing happens after this time, get three quotes for the cost of the work from properly qualified contractors.

Step 4 – write to your landlord again enclosing copies of the quotes and giving them a final chance to do the work, for example, within two weeks. The letter should warn that, otherwise, you'll do the work yourself and deduct the cost from the rent. Keep a copy of your letter.

Step 5 – if there's no response, arrange for the contractor who gave the lowest quote to do the work.

Step 6 – pay for the work and send a copy of the receipt to your landlord and ask for the money to be paid back to you. Keep a copy of your letter.

Step 7 – if the landlord doesn't pay back the money, you can deduct the cost from future rent, but not other charges such as service charges. Send your landlord a breakdown of the amounts to be deducted, when they will start and when they will end. Keep a copy of your letter.

I'm not saying its right or wrong, but at the end of the day the BBC has an obligation to serve the demands of the populace.

Whether it be beggars on the street, or increased competition in their trade. 

I read [this article](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21627665-workers-continue-feel-pinch-what-recovery) the other day on The Economist and I found the ending paragraph quite telling. Especially as The Economist is a socially liberal publication. 

&gt;One mooted explanation for low wages is particularly controversial. UKIP, Britain’s insurgent anti-EU party, claims that immigration from Europe is holding down pay. Evidence on this is mixed: conflicting studies have separately found both a small increase and a small reduction in average wages as a result of migration. But there is better evidence that its effects are unequal; the lowest-paid workers, who face the fiercest competition from migrants, find their wages held down by the arrival of foreign workers. Higher earners are more likely to benefit. Division, it seems, is rife. With an election around the corner, politicians are sure to take notice.

So maybe it's not as clear cut as one side being wrong just because they're working class. Perhaps they're just experiencing a problem that us middle class people aren't exposed to as readily? 

I mean, an immigrant will have an easier time stealing someones tesco job than they will stealing a bank teller position.. It'd be easy enough for the bank teller to believe there is no problem. 

So, yeah. I'm on the fence.. Whatever problem immigration might be causing absolutely does not effect me or my profession. But I think it's a bit wrong to blanketly dismiss peoples people who do see it as a problem as idiots.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"While not agreeing with open borders may not be intolerant encouraging people to support you on the basis that immigrants are to blame for their problems will create intolerance. 

I've mentioned sovereignty before on here but it's a red herring imo. By UKIPs definition we lose sovereignty whenever we take part in any international organisation or treaty or convention. If you oppose the EU on the basis of sovereignty you should oppose the UN or NATO on the same basis. We are treaty bound in various ways by both organisations and the only way to avoid those obligations is to leave but UKIP does not have a problem with either. 

All the things you mention that concern working people have been issues since 1979 while we've only had high levels of immigration from the EU for 10 years. Do you really think it's a coincidence that working people are suddenly more receptive to a message of 'blame immigration' when they just went through a recession? Low wages are a function of our national economic policy and unemployment remaining relatively high. [The Adam Smith institute are quite right on this](http://www.adamsmith.org/news/ukips-proposal-to-lower-uk-migration-cap-is-intellectually-and-morally-bankrupt/): there is no correlation between immigration and unemployment nor between immigration and wage stagnation.

Nor is there any relationship with pressure on services: immigrants are less likely than British people to claim with EU migrants being the least. I think fullfact has an article debunking Farage's claims about social housing.

Job security has been a thing of the past for at least 20 years; wasn't it Bill Clinton in the 90s that said there was no longer such a thing as a job for life? It has nothing to do with immigration which only began in large quantities in 2004 when Poland joined. 

Also the whole 'Romanians working below minimum wage' is such a frustrating argument. It is illegal to hire anyone below the minimum wage or in dangerous working conditions. Those employers should be arrested. If the Home Office is incapable of actually enforcing its own worker's rights law then what is the point of even having it and either way how is that the EU's fault? 

By and large people are attributing economic hardship caused by the recession to the effects of immigration and it's bullshit and unfair. We may still be prosperous outside of the EU but we won't be as prosperous as inside.

It can be just the same with a song about necrophilic rape.

The metric system, actually SI is the foundation for the all of the worldwide technical standards under ISO and IEC.  Thus those nations whose standards are harmonised with ISO and IEC do use SI and the economy of the country works best when SI is used in all cases.  

One, it eliminates any confusion between units,

Two, it makes all citizens able to partake in the SI based economy.  Those outside of the use of SI are then useless to industry and will always be on the outside looking in and boycotted from meaningful, high paying employment.  

Right now there are only remnant uses of USC or imperial in obscure circumstances, mostly in the use of trade descriptors, such as pipe products, TV &amp; computer monitor screens, tire rims, etc.  In the case of pipe, the inches used in the description don't match any actual physical dimension of the pipe.  In the case of TVs, monitors, tire rims, etc, the actual manufacturing dimensions are in millimetres.  TVs and monitor sizes in inches don't match the actual scree dimensions as measured and are thus called as a class size.  For example, a ""Class 32"" TV is really 800 mm in dimension and is less than the 32 inches (813 mm) it implies.

We will go on trading with the EU member states. It is quite simple really. The euro is a disaster of a currency union while the euro zone is the worst performing market in the world. Economic predictions by various authorities highlight that trend will continue. Various parts of Europe have very high unemployment rates. The EU sells more to the UK than the UK does the EU. The EU is in no position to jeopardize this trade. 

What's more is the fact that all the EU will remain exactly the same with a UK exit except trade with the UK. While the UK can then begin to instantly negotiate and agree it's own free trade deals. Half of our trade is not with the EU. Overwhelmingly most of our trade is internal. Which would no longer be EU concentric, controlled or regulated.  The line that half of the UK export market is with the EU is also false. The actual figure lies around 35%. Still large. However due to the performance of the EU and the emerging economies around the world that figure continues to decline year on year. 

UKIP propose cuts where they can be made. While non of the other parties have any solutions as to balancing the budget, let alone reducing the debt. UKIP are clear that they are against big government. Not front line services. A government under all the main parties that when shit goes wrong, another layer of management, bureaucracy or department is setup up.

The reddit response to this episode is ridiculous.  If you look back at the episodes this season the proportion of different kinds of episodes is the same as all other seasons. There are the really stunning episodes geared toward older audiences (3- Listen, Mummy, Flatline) episodes geared toward family audiences, in this case the ones focusing on kid adventures (2- KTM, Forest), the side character focused episodes set on earth (1- Caretaker), the mediocre mini action flicks (2, Time heist, Into the Dalek), the main story arc focused episodes (3- Breath, the finale), the purposely over-the-top ridiculous episode (1- Robot of Sherwood).

If there is a problem with the writing it's that the writing team can't seem to write children/family stories very well.  They are all poorly paced with terrible plot holes.

Before the metrication attempts in the US in the '70s, the US was almost 100 % USC, not imperial.  But despite the popular belief it failed, it was adopted by many multinational industries and is still used behind the scenes.  You can go into any shop that sells fasteners and buy metric sizes as well as metric tools.  Before the ""failed metrication efforts"" none were available.  

The US also imports a plethora of metric designed and made products from all over the world.  Almost every product is dual labelled with more than just a few of them rounded metric.  The US is flooded in metric even if it pretends to live in a USC paradise.  It can not escape the world-wide use of metric, even if it tries.

The US does not use imperial, in fact imperial is illegal in the US.  The US instead use what is known as US Customary (USC) and since the Mendenhall Order of 1893, all USC is metric defined.  This due to the fact that the physical USC standards from England were shrinking at a phenomenal rate.  

The differences were greater before 1960 and caused problems in producing war parts in WWII.  Despite some harmonisation after 1960, there are still unrectifiable differences that make the two versions or English historical units mutually incompatible.

Imperial was a reform adopted in the British Empire of 1824, but was never adopted in the US, thus it is illegal in the US.   So it is wrong to identify the US as using imperial.  ",0,1414333598,null,0,false,0,clk690w,t3_2kbjwy,t1_clk690w,t3_2kbjwy,null,1426343924,2,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,2

The poppy was a symbol of horrifically decimating the population, and commemorating the immense loss of life.

Modern wars are completely different, and much less worthy of respect. Why should we be holding national ceremonies for career soldiers who died while fighting wars of aggression? It's so immensely different from the World War situation that it seems thoroughly unworthy to conflate the two.

Some positives first.

* Rose was great today. Going forward and when defending - did a great job. Can't complain.

* Ryan Mason was very good in the first 60 minutes as well - running everywhere, set up the goal we scored and did a great job interlinking play in midfield and making sure the ball moved forward.

Now, negatives.

* Ade should have been subbed off at the 60th minute. Lamela should have been subbed off at the same time. Dembele should have come on for Capoue so that we wouldn't have to pull an attacking midfielder into a holding position. Bad calls.

* Lamela was atrocious today. Hogging the ball, not creating - sometimes he has to realize that it's not about proving himself but it's about making sure that the club gets the result that it needs to get. 

* Chadli was very mediocre as well. He should have hit the Eriksen free kick on target at least.

* Our attitude after going 1-0 up was not good enough. I think I've said this about 50 times in this sub. Every other top four team looks to go 3, 4, 5 goals up after getting that first goal in. We create half chances, take speculative shots and then smile at each other. Happy.

* Dier was horrible today as well. After being responsible for the goal - he should have had extra fire to get in there and score, create, defend well - he just deflated.

* Today's loss is on Poch's shoulders in my mind. Last, but not the least, well done Newcastle.

This will harm the UK's economy quite bit.

Also, lots of companies have a base in the UK solely to provide a market for the EU. We will lose that if we exit the EU. This will also harm the economy. Do you really think all of those companies will be happy to provide two bases, instead of one? UK is a small country, it's unlikely companies will go as far as to provide their product in the UK, especially if it's something expensive.

Players I'd sell while they have any value:
Lloris - he's gone anyway. Vorm is a very good PL keeper. Pick up a young up and comer to take over when ready.
Lamela - He's a luxury player when we need a right winger.
Lennon - He has the RW pace we need but lacks skills in the box. He's shown he's done developing those skills now move him on.
Vertonghen - I'd love if he'd play left back although Rose would be hard to beat right now. I disagree with all who say he's our top CB. He's made too many mistakes over the last 6 - 9 months and has value on the market.
Soldado - I love the guy but he's done. That volley effort was not worthy of a top striker and personified his time at the club.
Ade - Still has value and could fetch 10 or 12 mil pounds. I don't think he won a single 50/50 header today and he was the tallest guy on the pitch.
Dembele - Similar to Lennon. Tons of talent but seems to have reached his peak.

Bring in fighters to add to our squad nucleus: Rose, Kaboul, Walker, Eriksen, Capoue, Kane, Mason. And, drop the double inverted wingers. They create such congestion in the middle that 4 defenders can handle 5 or 6 attackers.

This would be painful to watch until they gel, but this season is gone already. Let's develop for the future.

'Thank you for contacting us about the proposed format for the 2015 General Election debates. We have received a wide range of feedback from supporters of different political parties across the UK. In order to use our TV licence fee resources efficiently, this response aims to answer the key concerns, but we apologise in advance if it doesn’t address your specific points in the manner you would prefer.

The BBC is working with other broadcasters to try and make election debates happen in 2015 and we believe we have set out a fair and realistic formula. Twenty two million people saw some of the debates in 2010. They were very successful in engaging the electorate, especially first time voters and the broadcasters would like them to happen again at next year’s general election. We are also putting forward our own proposals for other debates across the UK.

Ensuring impartiality during an election campaign is a priority and judgements about debates, and other programmes, are taken on the basis of objective editorial assessments of a number of factors, including the levels of past and current electoral support for each party.

Although UKIP did not win a seat in the 2010 general election, they polled more than three times as many votes as the Green Party, which did win a seat. In the 2014 European elections, UKIP topped the poll, beating all the Westminster parties in terms of seats (24) and share of the vote (more than 27% - up more than 10% on 2009). The Greens won three seats in the European election, with just under 8% of the vote (a small drop since 2009).

UKIP have also performed strongly in local government elections in England for the past two years and have more councillors than the Greens. Before their victory in Clacton, UKIP had come second in every Westminster by-election for the last two years – the Greens’ best performance was around 4%.

We also take account of opinion polls, when there is a robust and consistent trend: UKIP have been regularly polling in the mid-teens for more than two years, well ahead, for instance, of the Liberal Democrats and around 10 percentage points ahead of the Greens.

In Scotland, the BBC is proposing a debate, in peak time on BBC One, involving the leaders of the SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat parties. We are proposing a similar format of debate on BBC One from Wales, involving the leaders of Plaid Cymru, Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP. We have written to the parties to begin discussions about our proposals and we will ensure impartiality during the Election in Scotland and Wales. Full details of our content will be released over the coming months once they are finalised.'",0,1414338189,null,0,false,0,clk825z,t3_2kbqcl,t1_clk825z,t1_clk1nke,null,1426343080,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

If you do, then suggesting changing manager after he's only been there two months, and with that continuining the volatile and disruptive atmosphere of last season, is ridiculous. Pochettinho was at fault today, he was slow to react to the goings on in-game and didn't necessarily equip the players as best he could to win, but to sack him? Are you crazy?

Does the fact that he's an employee of the club stop him from being allowed to be human? Are the players not allowed to be human? Today was shit, but sacking and starting again is the worst option moving forward. There have been positive signs during this season from the coaching staff and from the playing staff, clearly we still have a lot to work on, but the current group we have is a good group. 

We beat Soton. We kept up with City for 70 minutes. We nearly won at the Emirates. We hugely outplayed Sunderland. What are you expecting... that we win every game? After a new guy has come in and has only had one transfer window to alter the squad? We won't do any better than Europa League places this season, don't be so reactionary, just be patient and let Poch and the players grow into the season. We could yet have a good FA cup run or Europa league run ahead of us.

We've had so many other issues this season that people have forgotten about the fact that Gerrard has weaknesses and a weak midfield will leave him exposed. It's not going to be talked about until we start two strikers some game and the other team cops on and absolutely pummels us in midfield. 


Two strikers to me says that Balotelli isn't good enough to do the job on his own and we're giving him help to do his job while hurting other areas. It's a perfectly good tactic towards the end of the game but our midfield can't cope for a full game with two strikers, especially with one like Balotelli up front.

It's harsh but Rom really really needs to improve (I know he scored but let's be honest it was a bit of a fluke that it went in). When we Eto'o scoring goals like his second and playing so well throughout the game there must come a point when Roberto will have to make a decision between Sammy and Rom, probably when Kev comes back because Naisy, Kev, Ross, Rom and Eto'o won't fit into the same team. Rom just needs to show up and play as well as his price tag would indicate. He can become World Class but he has to improve.

I thought Ross was also a bit raw when he came on. He didn't play bad by any means but some balls could've been handled better but aside from that he was good. 

Alcaraz was really good in my opinion, yeah he made a few mistakes but I would argue Jags did too. He's a good stand in until Stones comes back anyway if anything  else. 

Naisy was also class, never stopped working and definitely one of my favourite players because of his work rate. Barry seemed to return to his best today too, thought Macca was a bit invisible from time to time but he did work hard. Don't know how Osman still gets in the team honestly. Seems McGeady would've been a better winger in that position, can only imagine it's because he came out and said he wants to play which seems to be kind of lobbying for himself publically which I for one don't like or either it's that Roberto feels he owes him something because he's an ""icon"" of the club. 

If we can stop the individual errors for the goals, which most of the nearly 20 goals we've conceded this season were. (I'd say you could count on one hand the goals that teams scored against us where we could say no one was at fault for them) we can return to being the dominate force that everyone knows us as where no body is guaranteed points against us. We have one of the best attacks in the league and all we have to do is tighten up at the back but as Roberto said himself clean sheets don't matter.

Positives: 

Mason has cemented himself as a starter. 

Rose looked great. Still needs to work on crossing though. 

Eriksen had a so so game, I would say more positive than negative. But Newcastle did well to nullify him. 

Negatives: 

Walker needs to come back. I love Dier, but he's not suited to play RB. He was too easily overwhelmed today and that's only going to continue happening. 

Lamela was fatigued from Thursday. He's not at the point where he can play basically a full EL game and then a full PL game. I know that's more on our lack of playmakers in the 2nd squad, but I don't know, it just isn't going to work. 

Capoue disappeared. I don't have words. 

Chadli is beginning to remind me of why I was so frustrated with him last year. He had no impact and is beginning to look like he has no intention of playing well.

A decent, professional and hardworking performance against a poor Burnley side. I feel bad for them in a way, they have come up and have literally spent no money on acquiring PL quality talent. Whilst I agree with the philosophy of keeping a core of the players that won you promotion, a lot can be said for proven experience in being a good player in top flight football, and sadly Burnley do not have those.

More worryingly for us is that we still conceded. I think it is fair to say that they offered no threat, Howard could have set up a deckchair and enjoyed a Hot Toddy in the net for most of the game... But we gifted them a goal with a sloppy bit of play from Lukaku.

Whilst this mistake will get scrubbed off our record, as he showed his worth at the other end of the pitch moments later- against a better side, that sort of shit will end up costing us points. Much has been spoken about our poor defence thus far this season, but in actuality we have been pretty good overall- currently we have the second best away defensive record in the league, and if we could scrub out these silly errors (like we did last season); I can see us causing a lot of trouble for top teams both at home and away. 

Back to the game; I think the term 'professional', that I used at the start of this post really sums up the game. We didn't underestimate them (like we did Palace) and we kept a decent level of intensity throughout the 90 minutes thanks to the hard work of players like Baines, Naismith and (surprisingly) Eto'o.

Dwelling on that final name, Eto'o has really surprised me in an Everton shirt. We all knew he was a world class player with the ball at his feet, but was he coming to Everton to secure one nice final paycheque before heading into the wider world of MLS- or was he here to play like an Evertonian; well, this game answered that question (if there was any doubt remaining). Eto ran until the 95th minute, chased lost causes and capitalised on the defensive mistakes from Burnley- stretching the game excellently and reminding them who they were up against on the few occasions they looked to be gaining confidence. For a man ridiculed by Mourinho for being an old man with a fake passport, he chased the ball like a 22 year old kid fighting for his place in the team- true blue attitude for a future cult legend of the club. 

Another performance I would like to reflect on is Lukaku's. I saw some negative sentiment about him in the match thread, but aside from his mistake (which, I admit was a huge one) for the goal, I felt he had a very good game for us. He made good runs, opened up space and was industrious. Whilst he still doesn't look like a £28m man, he is improving with every game, and I am sure he will explode into life within weeks. 

As there were no real specific positional or tactical strategies that were out of the ordinary (that I noticed on first viewing anyway), it brings me to my man of the match. The easy answer would be Eto'o, he could (should?) have had a hatty, and he was very good the whole game... But to put the cat amongst the pigeons I will give the MotM to Naismith, who tirelessly worked the whole pitch and was the most effective player in making sure Burnley didn't hit any rhythm. A top 'typical Everton' performance from the kiddo.  ",0,1414339011,null,0,false,0,clk8fcb,t3_2kdhwy,t1_clk8fcb,t3_2kdhwy,null,1426342909,10,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,10

Our problem is width. Lamela and Chadli both drift inside, which means that quite often we'll have our entire front four occupying the same space. It's too easy to defend against, which is why we only scored the one goal.

The attacking width is also the cause of our defensive problems, or at least some of them. Rose and Dier, our fullbacks, were having to play like wingers to compensate for Lamela and Chadli, which left gaps at the back. This was made worse by Kaboul also deciding he felt like being a winger - at one point he lost the ball at their corner flag. 

When we brought on Lennon I was hopeful. It would help with our width and let Dier focus more on defence (bearing in mind both goals came from the right). However, we didn't use Lennon. We should have been passing to him near the halfway line and letting him sprint down the wing, but we didn't.

Our best matches this season have been the ones where we didn't use out usual tactics. Against Arsenal we played a more defensive, counter attacking game rather than our usual possesion game. Our win on thursday saw us use two forwards and a traditional winger, and those two changes led to our best game yet.

Last year, he scored for fun in the preseason, so he was given a chance in the first team. He was our most exciting player on the pitch for much of the first half of the season. Just watch his brilliant goal against Tottenham, probably the goal of the season. 

But there were rumors he didn't show up to training and had a bad attitude. There were also rumors of worse- A fight between Ravel and another player in training, rumors of Sam trying to get ravel to sign with his agent and Ravel getting very angry, etc.  He also stopped looking brilliant in matches, fading in and out of games, mostly out.  He complained of a groin injury but didn't want to get surgery, or something. 

So he was loaned to QPR, where he started out brilliantly and ended okay. Again. 

This summer, he picked up a court case for beating up his ex girlfriend and her mom. 

This season, surplus to requirements and well down the pecking order,  he was sent on loan to Cardiff.  I think he was impressive in his first game there, and then he had become mysteriously absent. 

I'm kind of curious why, but not too bothered. I think it's extremely unlikely he is at West Ham next year. Maybe he will fulfill his potential and make use of all that talent somewhere else.

2007 - Ramos, inherited Jol's spurs team close to relegation, saved us, got us a trophy, had a shocking start to the ~~07/08~~ 08/09 season, and rightly sacked.

2008 - Harry Redknapp. The best spurs manager that I've seen. Great exciting football, great premier league finishes, brought the best out of players, great champion's league run. I personally loved the personality in interviews, brought a closeness to the club that I haven't felt since. Left over the England debacle, wrong of him, but I feel he should have been given another season.

2012 - AVB - boring football, inflexible tactics, good finishes, but Bale was highly responsible for AVB's first season success, and AVB failed to integrate new signings into a successful system. Rightly sacked.

2013 - Tim Sherwood. An interim manager in disguise, given a contract as a confidence boost for his first managerial job. Was never really going to get a long-term job. Great for getting us through a tough period. Rightly sacked, a club like Spurs needs a bigger manager.

Should Levy have given any managers more time? With Jol, the majority of us wanted him out. Moreso with Ramos. Harry probably should have been given more time, but we were a bit sensitive about his feelings over the England job. AVB, maybe, but his football was too frustrating to watch, and he had a long way to go before we looked like beating any big premier league club in 2013. Sherwood wasn't as attractive as the available managers out there. I personally didn't see Sherwood taking us further.

But the renting market needs to be more tightly regulated, especially with regards to extra ""fees"" and the standard of living provided. For instance I feel energy ratings should play a bigger role.

What a strange question to ask. I've said here that Soldado should be moved on in spite of his record in Spain. Why would Lamela be any different? 

&gt;It's only his second fucking year basically?

Well if we're going into semantics, maybe the last nineteen games is going to be a better gauge of how well he can do. He'd have played all the teams in the league, and should ideally adjust to it. 

&gt;I think we deserve to be in the bottom half of the league right now.

Then you're already framing our progress in a negative light. If what Poch says about this being a long term project, we have to stop looking at immediate improvements. It's not as if he's here to save us from relegation. 

Just...take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Our squad is very young, the manager is still green in comparison to who we're trying to compete against, and some of the buys from last season are finally bedding in. 

We got stuck in against West Ham with ten men down and showed a resilience that wasn't there last season, lost 3-0 to Liverpool but at least we played well, was unlucky against Sunderland, took points off of Arsenal at the Emirates, for City it's ditto for Pool except that a lot of things went against us that day. West Brom and Newcastle have been the only truly horrendous displays IMO. 

&gt;but their point was we need a true winger. 

You said yourself that Dier's not a true right back. Let's not even acknowledge that he's played *so much* since coming, and that most of the width provided on the left today was by Rose. If/when Walker's back or Yedlin shows up in January, this problem won't be as glaring. We need wingbacks in this system, not fullbacks. A center back playing out of position was never going to fix that problem. Neither is a Jesus Navas-esque winger when our strikers are out of form, meaning that goals have to be coming from the front three.

Rom's finish wasn't exactly world class, but it was a really good move leading up to it, and he did well to get it out of his feet to get the second shot away. Nobody really had a bad game, and let's face it, against a side like Burnley that's exactly the way it should be. 

On Lukaku, whatever he might be in a few years, right now his first touch and his passing just aren't that good. With that in mind, he should really be playing the target man role, battering defenders and providing the option up top. His strength isn't in dropping deep to play the little passes, and with the likes of Naismith, Eto'o, Osman, Pienaar and Barkley in the squad, he doesn't really need to even try that stuff. He can learn that on the training ground if he has to.

I like Burnley, I like Sean Dyche and I like a lot of their players. They're going down, but I think they always planned for that.

&gt; Where does the money go?
Through the white poppy our aim is primarily to raise issues. We distribute the white poppies each year to challenge the view that war and preparations for war are necessary or inevitable. Any money raised over and above the cost of producing, publicising and distributing the white poppies goes to fund our education work, some of which can be seen on our main website. Such work regrettably does not attract much funding and so we rely heavily on the generosity of people like you. Donations can be made here or if you are a UK Taxpayer you can add value to your contributions to peace education work through our associated charity the Peace Research and Education Trust . We are sure they will welcome your support.

&gt; PS Every year there is always someone, often in the media, who implies that money raised is used for some suspect activity; others categorically insists that the white poppies are 'taking money from the valuable work the British Legion is doing' and we get a lot of intemperate emails.
If you happen to hold this view why not check with the British Legion whether this is true before complaining to us.

&gt;You may also like to know that the Peace Pledge Union's annual turnover is similar to the annual salary (£95,000+) of the British Legion's chief executive.

As for the strikers, Adebayor's apparently lost much of his hold-up play and mobility this season. Soldado's movement is inconsistent at best. This is why a Tevez-style striker would be my dream signing: someone who scares defenders into mistakes and never stops running and hassling.

Where Siggy and Dempsey shone was late runs into the box to score, which is what Dembele and Paulinho *should* be doing. But Paulinho's all enthusiasm and no control, and Dembele just dribbles effortlessly to nowhere in particular, mulling over the idea of passing to a teammate some point in the next six to twelve months as he goes. 

To fit Siggy in, we'd probably have to sit deeper with harder-working wingers (e.g. Lennon) and use him as a second striker rather than an Eriksen-style playmaker.

19.12 It is recognised that there are no new powers of entry for police or police staff when conducting home visits.

It means many also have massive power fantasies around guns, gleefully imagining themselves shooting criminals and UN governments agents out to take their rights (or, at least that's the impression Alex Jones and /r/forwardsfromgrandma gives me).

And (2) which involves the Doctor running away from things while doing quirky alien things, and packing in as much zany antics as possible.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that one is inherrently better than the other, and there are plenty of episodes that fall out of this mould, but I think this one in particular fails because it was trying to be both and ended up as neither.

Every time there's a mass shooting they claim it's because of mental illness, but any time anyone suggests mental health checks of gun owners they claim that's a violation of their rights. I've come to the conclusion that it's not really about guns at all, it's about their complete inability to understand that their actions impact other people and that they bear moral responsibility. 

I think they understand that lax gun controls and easy access to guns is a direct cause of lots of Americans being killed by guns, I think they just don't care. Caring would involve being able to empathise with the victims and their families and loved ones, it would involve being able to understand that people are more important than objects and I simply don't think they have that capacity. 

There's a big cross over between the extreme pro-gun lobby on reddit (the ones who won't accept any level of gun control laws whatsover) and the Ayn Rand type of libertarian who makes a virtue out of pathological selfishness. I don't think that's a coincidence. 

British gun owners who own guns legally for legitimate purposes would do better to just not associate with these people, the best way to make the general public fear British gun owners would be to make them think that they are of the same mindset as the NRA and the extremes of the American gun culture.

Because the player has no say in moving? He had 2 years at the club with 70+ apps, if he was going to be used in his ""proper"" role he probably would've/should've been by now. Can't blame him if he was a driving force in the move.

&gt;I cannot reasonably blame our defenders for our performances

Blame, no, but like everything they aren't perfect. Pointing out mistakes is fine.

&gt;We have issues on the wings

Wingers come inside far too much, leaving the only width provided by fullbacks. With Dier playing most games that's not going to be good, he's going to get tired and you can't stretch them without it. Perhaps they should rotate more, or play on their conventional side. Marking 3 or four players just in front of your back four is much easier.

&gt;We need to give Paulinho more game time. Like him or not he was our third highest PL goalscorer last season, just edging Sigurdsson. With both players out of the team our goal tally is collapsing even further.

Depends where he's playing. If you put him holding behind, slightly ahead of Capoue for example he needs to get forward to score obviously which leaves Cap exposed, especially if it's against a counter attacking team.

&gt;He wants PL football, he would be cheap, he loves the club and he is a RELIABLE goalscorer.

Since when? Kane scored more goals in the league in April than Defoe did in '13 and '14.

With Clara, she is being given waaaaay too much airtime and overshadowing Capaldi, however Capaldi is a wonderful actor and takes away many scenes with her. But looking at a few episodes. Robin Hood: he floated around in the background making odd remarks and collecting data, but the focus was on Clara and Robin for some odd reason. Kill the Moon: he leaves for 20 minutes of the show! Why?! To have Clara make some big decision she's incapable of doing? Dumb! Flat line: he's stuck in the Tardis and Clara becomes the ""Doctor"". Then he makes a grandeur entrance near the end to banish the 2D creatures. I really like Capaldi and I want to see his character develop, like it did with every other Doctor.

That aside I would class myself as a supporter of Celinio based on his actions to date. That's not to say he can do no wrong and is clearly a man with an... eccentric personality, issues of delagation, and an ego the size of Elland Road itself!

But if you look at his actions with the club finances, and bringing in players. The stuff that matters. He's the best we have had in the last decade.

I feel like there is a section of the Leeds 'support' who salavates at every loss and every new drama regarding Celinio.. Surely it's better to judge a man on his actions, rather than a preconcived hate of the guy.. It's not fucking helping anyone to be negative. Be a healthy sceptic instead!

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Public bodies are thought to have spent between £770 million and £1 billion on foreign criminals,

[This is because the government is not deporting enough foreign criminals despite the fact they are legally able to.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29715630) This has little to do with the EU though because they are talking about non-EU criminals. The European Arrest Warrant system makes it trivially easy to extradite criminals to EU countries where they are wanted. The only reason it might be spent on EU citizens is because they are being given a fair trial to determine if they should be extradited. If you disagree with this then feel free to argue that we should stop giving people fair trials. 

&gt;Temporary migrants cost...Migrants cost

Costs are fairly irrelevant unless you also know how much the migrants are paying in tax. If those migrants are paying more in tax than they take out then the NHS and social services actually profit from them. [This study from UCL](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467) indicates that the most recent Eastern European immigrants make a net contribution because they pay more tax than they claim in benefits meaning the welfare system actually gains by them being here. By contrast, British people only pay for 89% of the benefits they use so are a drag on the system. Or to put it another way European migrants are currently keeping the welfare and pensions system afloat. 

&gt;A gangmaster who kept Romanian agricultural workers in inhumane conditions

And? This is a serious problem with our domestic law which has nothing to do with EU law or any EU court...unless your suggesting that it is a mistake to allow Romanians to come here because their all like that which would seem to undermine the other people I've talked to here who claim that anti-EU people don't blame the immigrants only the system. In fact if the UK had fully embraced the European Charter of Fundamental Rights introduced by the EU rather than opting out of it these migrants would have a much better chance of appealing the decision. 

&gt;Then add in the costs of being in the EU

The cost/benefit argument is an open an shut case. We clearly benefit from the common market. Even many UKIP supporters want to try and stay in the EFTA but they don't seem to realise that if we did that the EU would still be able to make trade rules for us. 

The costs of the EU are [far outweighed](http://www.cbi.org.uk/campaigns/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-2-benefits-of-eu-membership-outweigh-costs/) by the positives both financial and political. Again you're focusing on costs without taking into account what you get for it. It's like saying I bought a car last week and lost £10,000. In fact you exchanged £10,000 for a £10,000 car so to say you lost that amount is just plain misleading. [With the EU we exchange about £8 billion for access to the biggest trade bloc on the planet](http://www.cbi.org.uk/campaigns/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-2-benefits-of-eu-membership-outweigh-costs/) with 500 million customers, $600 billion of *extra* investment from EU countries beyond what we would get if outside the EU and $31 trillion in trade deals that have or are being negotiated by the EU on terms that are much more favourable than we would be able to get alone. Free trade agreements outside the EU are unlikely to provide the same benefits as inside. Australia and Canada are perfect examples. Both have free trade agreements with the US. [Canada's overall trade costs actually rose after the signing of NAFTA while Australia's fell after the signing of the AUS-US FTA but only by 0.06%](https://i.imgur.com/SkwDtZB.png) because US trade was not a very significant proportion of trade (~7-10%). We have the same proportion of trade with the US so would expect to see Australian style changes with about a 1/2 of 1% drop in the cost of trade over 5-6 years. [Compare this to the effect of the EU where the UK has seen a 6.5% drop](https://i.imgur.com/4iaWK3U.png) (yes that's about 35 times what Australia saw after signing a trade agreement with the US taken over the same length of time) in total trade costs directly from EU rules while costs to trade in the rest of the world combined only contributed little more than a 2% drop in the same 15 year period.  The reason is because the EU is so much deeper and more comprehensive than any other free trade area precisely because it creates common rules on selling goods and regulating EU workers etc. Whereas the rules surrounding goods and services between the US and AUS are totally different and make it hard to trade especially for small businesses who don't have armies of lawyers. The EU solves these problems but still has a long way to go; it will be at least a decade before the common market is finished and we see the full benefits of a common market in services where the UK is very strong. I wouldn't even be able to hazard a guess at the astronomical benefit a common market in services would be to our economy. This blog does a good job of explaining why there are hundreds of billions of €s potential in the services market much of which will benefit the UK. 

There are plenty of reasonable things to criticise the EU on, none of which justify leaving BTW, but cost/benefit calculations are not one of them. There is no serious argument against the big trade and investment returns the UK enjoys because of the EU.

One thing I've never understood  about the whole constitution/amendment aspect is that you often get ammosexuals in the US (usually angry middle aged white men) screaming ""you can't change the second amendment/constitution!""   whilst the wiki definition of amendment is - *""An amendment is a formal or official change made to a law, contract, constitution, or other legal document. It is based on the verb to amend, which means to change. Amendments can add, remove, or update parts of these agreements.

*Into the Dalek* was rehashed crap. It's an excellent example of how Moffat has run out of ideas and is now just recycling less impressive versions of stories he has already told.

*Time Heist* had some nice stuff to it, but a good heist story needs a revelation at the end of it: A point where all the elements you've seen in the story up to that point are suddenly revealed to have meant something completely different. *Time Heist* didn't accomplish that; it fell back on Moffat's penchant for deus ex machina (which has been a major affliction in his tenure whether he's been writing the scripts or not). Lots of nice moments again, but hard to argue that it's anything more than mediocre.

Note that eligibility for conscription depends upon having a clear mental health check and a clear criminal record which both national and local/federal government has to sign off. 

They also aren't allowed to carry guns in public unless they're a trained member of the police, army or security services. 

See this article for more details on Swiss gun laws.  Also note that although Switzerland has a low violent crime rate, it does have a high suicide rate, because desperate people can find ways to make make-shift ammunition.

In fact, applications shouldn’t go to either place — they should be sent to a voter’s local election board. The form also tells applicants that it’s due 30 days before an election, when it’s actually due 25 days before. And it includes the wrong zip code for the board of elections.""*

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-wisconsin-reports-of-voter-suppression-efforts/ 

*""reports out of the state suggest that robocalls are being placed informing voters, falsely, they don't have to vote if they signed the recall petition. There have also been reports of mailings going out to voters telling them they can't vote unless they did so in 2010, and of people going door-to-door telling voters they don't have to go to the polls if they signed the recall petition, both of which are also untrue.""*

There is also a lot of controversy about Voter ID laws enacted in a lot of Republican states. 

*""A team of politician scientists from Appalachian State, Texas Tech and the University of Florida took on that question for an article just published in [Political Research Quarterly](
http://prq.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/10/15/1065912914554039) (h/t: Justin Levitt). Their conclusion is that the claims of proponents that they're just upholding the principle of ballot integrity can be discounted; the photo ID laws aim to disenfranchise Democratic voters; they cite findings that the raised cost of voting imposed by photo ID requires ""falls overwhelmingly on minorities."" In other words, the answer is yes.""*

Firstly and most obviously, not everybody is you, and not everybody thinks the Green's policies sound fantastic.  That's their right, and that's why (nearly) everybody over 18 is invited to vote.

Secondly, a lot of people who *do* think their policies sound fantastic think it would be a wasted vote, everybody else will vote for one of the big three (or even just one of Labour and the Conservatives).  This isn't an idea I agree with, so I'm not going to go into detail about the reasoning because I'll make a hatchet job of it and get 300 replies telling me how I'm wrong.

Semi-related to that is the people who think their policies sound great, but that they cannot *all* be enforced.  It's difficult to say before an election which policies a party will ultimately be willing to compromise on, what if they have to go back on the thing that was most important to you?  See: Liberal Democrats and tuition fees.

Getting a bit further into the realms of speculation here: I suspect a number of Liberal Democrat, and possibly Labour, voters would find that they agree with the Green Party on a lot of essential issues, but have assumed the Greens are only interested in the environment and haven't looked into their other policies.  A related issue is the fact that the leaders of the big three tend to get the most press coverage; the Greens are neither powerful enough nor enough of a spectacle to be frequent news.

Finally, some people, especially older people, vote for a particular party in every election because that's how they've always voted.  Hence, my advice to you as a new voter is to check every time you go to the polls that your chosen party still stands for what you think they stand for, and keep the *type* of election in mind, as the party you vote for in a local election might not be the same as the one you vote for in a general election, and there might be a third party you vote for in a European election.",0,1414347009,null,0,false,0,clkcl2x,t3_2kduub,t1_clkcl2x,t3_2kduub,null,1426340958,27,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,27

I think most people would agree with medical and psychological support though, especially if troops have returned from war with injuries to body and mind.

People keep saying how we need Costa back, but Drogba did fine today, before even taking the goal into consideration. Obviously Costa/Remy are improvements, but its not as dire as some sounded before. Used his strength and held up play well. Passing wasn't bad, showed that he still has the legs to play a full 90 too. He clearly isn't going to be running channels and the like, but for a third choice striker he's shown, at least to me, that he's clearly still a better option than say, Schürlle for striker. However, with Shrewsbury so soon I doubt he'll start, see Andre or maybe Solanke even.

Noticed how, during the first half, Shaw/Januzaj or maybe instructions kept Ivanovich from getting forward as he has this season which has been a major part of our attack. When he did manage to attack he created quite a few chances. This combined with closing down Cesc stifled our standard attack well.

Obvious shit decisions from Dowd.

Will be interesting to see how we play with two fullbacks suspended. Can anyone tell me how long Ivanovich's will last? Three or one?

Hazard needs to fucking finish those chances he makes when he dribbles past five fucking players.

When populations of fish decrease sometimes they'll engage in schooling behaviours and aggregate into larger populations over a smaller range. This means that whilst catches remain high, population remains low until eventually they're all gone. Extinctions that we've caused are bad generally, but if we allow our fishing practises to continue unchecked then not only are we causing wider ecological disasters **we're also losing a massive source of food**.

2. Ecosystems are pretty finely balanced and the sorts of changes we're making to marine ecosystems in particular with fishing are messing up that balance. We're altering levels of prey, predator, we're catching things we're not even going to eat etc. This is bad because we're altering the dynamics of a system without really thinking about it, and by doing that we can actually upset the conditions that caused this system to occur in the first place. This can result in us not being able to use the system any more (so maybe we can't eat that fish any more) but also could cause ecological collapse or extinctions.

3. Food has to be produced somewhere, right? There are almost eight billion people alive today, and all of those people need to eat. Consequently there need to be enough people producing food to feed eight billion people. That requires actual physical space. The reason that we in Britain can eat a range of foods for pretty much no real cost is because someone somewhere else grows it for us and sends it here. Which is great for us! But then how does everyone else eat? Many places import a large amount of their food, which must mean lots of other countries export a lot - but that doesn't necessarily mean those countries produce enough for their own people AND enough to export. Food security and malnutrition are **massive** problems in the developing world and a lot of it is driven by the developed world. However there are some avenues available to us to fix these issues, and I am personally a massive supporter of the potentials of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Whatever your opinion of companies like Monsanto, GMOs offer an amazing route solve many of these problems - they can deliver staggeringly high yields over a relatively smaller area, they can be modified to be more nutritious than wild-type varieties, they can even be used to deliver vaccines etc. Instead of just caring about where your food comes from you should also care about what it is, and I know there's tons of scare stories out there about GMOs but they do represent a key technology that could help us to fight food scarcity for evryone.

4. The exploitation of people in the developing world is directly fuelled by a western desire for cheap food and other products (e.g. coffee). Our desire for luxury goods creates a choice in many areas of the developing world between growing staple food crops which could feed their families and be sold to earn a little extra income or growing e.g. coffee or even coca for cocaine producers for the cash - but this creates a food deficit and fuels hunting of bush-meat (often endangered animals), which is already a fairly large problem.

5. We tend to think of the planet as something huge and basically immutable. It is pretty big, but it's also **literally the only thing in the known universe capable of housing us**. It isn't a machine. It isn't a 'garden of eden' which is dedicated to providing for us. It's a complex system of almost-unfathomably complex layers of processes which together produce an environment capable of sustaining us. This isn't the 'default setting'. The environment is this way because of a whole range of different elements interacting with one another, but a key component of these processes are trees. We need oxygen to breathe. Trees make oxygen. They do a load of other useful things as well, so if we cut them down and burn them not only have we released CO2 into the atmosphere we've also burnt the only thing capable of scrubbing it, namely forests.

In buying food and other products we essentially give implicit approval of a lot of dangerous activities unless we're careful what we buy. Sometimes it's unavoidable. Sometimes it can be more expensive, even prohibitively so. Not doing so doesn't make you a bad person either, it just means you have different priorities. But you should at least be aware of these issues because although there's little one individual person can do to fix it, we tend to forget that these problems weren't caused by individuals, they were caused by the *collective action (or inaction)* of **billions of people over the past few centuries**. There's generally not a single evil person saying 'let's cut down the forests and capture all the fish!!!!!'. Rather we've created a landscape through our choices and actions which means that certain choices produce particular economic benefit over other choices, and I guess that is how capitalism is supposed to work, except that sometimes what is economically good might be bad in the long term for ecological reasons, social reasons or even future resource extraction by other, future, people. If we extract everything now then there won't be anything left for later.

If someone is receiving tax credits, family tax credits, family allowance, council tax rebates, then they're not paying anything in taxes worth having, nor to cover their costs of existing in our society. Interesting costings on this link:  http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/1.38

Even if it did somehow turn out that immigration was a net financial benefit, that doesn't mean we can't fine tune the people coming here to a higher standard and improve those figures. 


|The costs of the EU

Well we know we pay in something around £18Bn per annum and receive £8Bn back in grants etc. We could both write multiple essays on the subject. I'll just say that we traded with European countries long before the EU existed and when it is long gone, we will continue to trade. Companies don't need politicians to sell their products and we don't need a bloated super-state in order to trade with 26 out of 192 of the worlds countries, whilst other countries outside of it have emerging markets that are booming. 

There's also the fact the Euro is failing, Germany is about to have a second recession. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/german-economy-headed-recession-exports-plunge-1469171

Fine, he fucked up. 

&gt;and drew against Sunderland

An 83rd minute own goal isn't on him. You're assuming he has mind control when what Kane did is out of his hands. 

&gt;If you compare the points taken from the same amount of games between this season and last, AVB's is much higher.

You know what? No. That's not a good enough comparison metric. We have to compare the level of opposition we were going up against too. 

Against Palace, Swansea and Hyll, we needed to be bailed out by penalties. That's nine points that could've become three if the ref ignored the call. So just like how we ""deserved"" to win against Sunderland, you can also argue that we ""deserved"" to draw against those three. Cosmic imbalance and all that. 

Here's who we played last season in our opening nine:
Palace, Swans, Arsenal, Norwich, Cardiff, Chelsea, West Ham, Villa, and Hull. 

Points total in nine games: 19
Points without penalties: 13

Two of those got relegated, and one of them were finished off before Pulis saved the day. 

With Poch:
West Ham, QPR, Pool, Sunderland, West Brom, Arsenal, Southampton, City, Newcastle. 

Points total in nine games: 11
Points without penalties: 11. 

So no, we got extremely lucky in AVB's opening by the look of it. You can argue that the penalties were just and blah blah blah, but penalties can always go either way unless the ref is standing right there. Not to mention the level of opposition that Poch has had to gone up against. AVB only really had Arsenal and Chelsea, and took one point away from a possible six, whereas Poch has had those three and took four points out of a possible nine, and that doesn't even begin to show that the Arsenal side we faced this year aren't much too different from the one before (if not stronger), and so on and so on. 

&gt;So he HAS to have had been reliably gaining us three points, because that is EXACTLY what he did.

Not reliably. Like I've said, the ref was our savior for three of those games. 14 points without the penalties and l that jazz.

This is often misconstrued as 'expecting top 4 quality' but we have every right to complain that people like Ade, Kaboul etc have the wrong attitude entirely.

I think Kaboul being made captain was a massive error, huge. He is not what he was in the single season he was good for us, and at his age, will likely never regain that form. I hope he proves me wrong before the end of the season.

It pisses me off week in week out that we have to watch what I can only describe as incompetence through laziness. I really want to name and shame here so I shall.

I think Verts' attitude fucking stinks at the minute, never see him sprinting, always has a face on when he has to do a bit of covering as if he's too good for it and should be playing exactly where and how he wants, all the time.

Kaboul is just a shower of shit now IMHO. He seems slow, careless and terribly too inconsistent, in every way, tackling, running, passing.

Rose puts in the effort and has improved this season, but my problem is with Poch. Rose has definitely had games he could have been dropped from, even through fatigue. Davies should have had some PL minutes by now to push Rose to improve even more.

Dier is too young and raw at the moment. Nothing to do with him, we are struggling at the minute at RB which every team can do in 1 position or another. I just hope Levy learns his lesson and we get Yedlin back ASAP and don't loan him out.

Not even going to mention Ade other than he's a lazy waste of space not worth the socks on his feet.

I feel very sorry for Hugo having to sit behind this pile of crap week in week out. Players like Lamela, Mason, Bentaleb, Capoue &amp; Rose run themselves into the ground for this club at times. Eriksen can be let off because its not his style to run himself tired and he does work hard. Soldado works hard, Kane busts a gut whenever he gets a chance.

I think Poch needs to be HUGELY more ruthless in dropping certain players when they simply don't show any interest when they're on the pitch.

A small selection of policies from that 2010 manifesto:

* Development of a written constitution.

* A 55mph speed limit on motorways.

* A 50% hike in alcohol and tobacco taxes.

* Abolishing tax relief on pension contributions.

* A ban on night flying.

* Immediately ban causing harm to animals (including but not only primates) in research, testing and education, and invest in the development of alternatives to animal experiments.

* Encourage a new, local and mutual financial sector, based on trust rather than greed, and including community banks, credit unions, local exchange schemes and local currencies.

* Not participate in the US missile defence system, and leave NATO.

* Fashion industry ban on size 0 models to reduce pressure on girls to conform to an unhealthy and unrealistic ideal.

Some of those are well-intentioned but unrealistic, some of those are just never going to gain popular support, some I disagree with on a personal level and some of those are just plain bonkers. The problem is that there is enough there to put me off voting for them.

The other problem is that the one test of Green leadership, at Brighton council, has been a long, long way from successful- hell, there was [almost a coup](http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10440458.Political_coup_to_oust_Brighton_and_Hove_council_leader_fails/).

Not only was the action a foul on its own, but the ball came to Ivanovic and he tried to kick it as he went down, that's denying a goal scoring opportunity and a that's a foul. And just to make things worse, in case the ref missed that, Terry was also being fouled at the same time. There were many calls for both sides that were obviously fouls and they went uncalled. It bothers me that those went uncalled yet this questionable foul gets penalized so heavily and costs us the game.

However, as I've gotten older from my idealistic teenage years, I come to realise that a lot of the Green policies are.. well, idealistic. A Basic Income sounds great, major investment in fossil fuels, living wage for all,  caps on bonuses, renationalise the railways..are all ideas that I agree with in principle! 

But, I feel that things are not quite as easy as the Greens make it sound. Life is complicated, with Government doubly so, and sofar the Greens haven't really given me much indication they'd actually be able to pay for and do any of these great policies, without some serious fiscal upheaval. They give an indictation on their website that they'd fund everything by going to a low-carbon economy for instance, but then what happens to all the heavy industries that contribute a fairly large proportion to our GDP?

I also think that their lack of real Government experience is a detriment. I know its a fairly stupid self fullfilling cycle... *I won't vote for them because they don't have experience, so they don't get experience which means I won't vote for them*... which is something Proportional Representation would completely fix, but that's a completely separate issue.

On a more personal note, I am likely going to be voting Labour in 2015. I **don't** generally support Labour, and I think Milliband is a total twat and an awful party leader, and I think that far far far too many Blairites and New Labour people still sit in positions of power within the front bench, **however** my local MP, Labour Hugh Bailey, has been generally an absolutely fantastic representative, and his voting record aligns very firmly with my beliefs. So, even though I **don't** support Labour, I **will** be voting Labour, voting for Hugh Bailey, purely because I feel he is the best person to represent York. What people need to remember is that not everything revolves around Westminster and Central Government; and we vote in candidates who's primary purpose (in theory) is to represent our constituency. Hugh Bailey has done a great job in that, which is why I won't be voting Greens in 2015.

Of course, a PR system would allow me to vote for Labour **and** the Greens, which is what I would do in that scenario, buuutt that's a separate issue like I said. ",0,1414351418,null,0,false,0,clkf0iy,t3_2kduub,t1_clkf0iy,t3_2kduub,null,1426339824,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

Not zero, none, or ""no"". This is Doctor Who! It goes without saying that there will be retconns. The question is over how large they will be, and over how many prior character appearances they will affect.

Now, in the episode The Next Doctor in which Miss Hartigan appears, the doctor explicitly says his weapon can kill or banish, and explicitly states that he wasn't try to kill her after he zaps her. We also see him disappear the big tin can with it. I think at best, what we saw in the scene was the cybermen and her ""disappearing"". It was an explosion in the ""dramatically defeated"" sense implicitly allowing for the possibility of return, but not an explosion in a ""doctor 100% killed them"" sense explicitly barring the possibility of return.

And what we've seen in the majority of finales thus far, is the doctors enemies we once thought defeated devising a way to come back from the alternate dimensions which they have been banished or escaped to. Having a once defeated enemy come back from an alternate dimension (perhaps called the ""Nethersphere"" in this instance) is not a major retconn in the Whoniverse, but rather something which has happened consistently and repeatedly throughout the series.

The petro-monarchies and Pakistan have a proven record of backing Sunni extremist groups, are you naive enough to believe it won't happen again, especially in a country as geographically important as Afghanistan?

The Afghan army is utterly incompetent, Afghanistan itself in its current form is not a real, actual country so few of the soldiers have much incentive to defend it. The Taliban are brutal and are very experienced at fighting, they are also very extreme in their views which makes negotiation or involving them in the democratic process utterly futile. 

It isn't going to end well, and that's a fact. When the Taliban start attacking villages what percentage of the Afghan army will defend those villages? Why would a soldier defend a village hundreds of miles away from his own village, a completely different tribe? These soldiers are people who joined for the paycheque, not to defend their country. Who is going to risk their lives to defend people who they have no real connection to?

Anyway my point is, UKIP's energy draft policy summary: 

 UKIP supports a diverse energy market including coal, nuclear, shale gas, geo-thermal, tidal, solar, conventional gas and oil. Encourage the re-development of British power stations, as well as industrial units providing on-site power generation.  Community Improvement Levy money from the development of shale gas fields. Abolish green taxes and charges in order to reduce fuel bills.

I agree with all this. The rest of the policy is basically the scrapping of all subsidies and building a stable power supply for Britain across various practical means. 

It looks to me that UKIP have a more open and practical approach to the matter. They mention various sources of power and the 'Encourage the re-development of British power stations'. It sounds like a good approach to meeting our future power needs, without financially crippling the poor and causing more people to die to do it.

That's why I'm going to vote green, because I know it's a ""wasted vote"" in that, I don't want them to win, but I want the other parties to take notice.

UKIP are getting lots of attention and that is clearly driving the major parties to start back thinking about immigration - so maybe this way we can deflect the media attention to green issues, away from distractions like immigration.

I also feel that we as individuals know climate change is the real danger, and we all have a responsibility to stand up and be heard.

This was by no means ""Kill the Moon"" bad, and while it was not a shining example of what Series 8 has produced, I liked it. 

Of course, with much of Doctor Who, I had a bit of skepticism concerning just how fast the trees disappeared when it was all done with, and I had a hard time believing that humanity just kept forgetting that this sort of thing happens. But Capaldi's scenes with the kids were especially good, and there were a lot of touching moments aside from that. I think people were expecting something more mind-blowing, but I see this episode as a way to lighten the mood a bit before things (obviously) get mega-dark for the finale. 

This is classic Doctor Who, guys. Great acting but an interesting and iffy logical plot. That's what makes this show great, in my opinion--that there's never a story that 100% makes sense.

Just to add to your point.

If you do want to buy ethically produced food, free as far as it can be of slave labour (I'm looking at you prawn industry etc.  Then you have to trust the shop you are buying from.  

If you go to a farm shop then fine you can speak to the farmer, local butchers are also great.  When you step up to supermarkets things get harder.


You have to trust the retailer.  If they focus on price then you can bet there is little left for checking of suppliers.  Then add into that the commoditising of food - contracts going to the lowest bidder.  This leads to manufacturers being forced to cut corners.

I don't expect him to ditch the kids and go on a safari with the doctor, but his complete disregard for what is happening and possible solutions to it (that could directly contribute to kids' safety), together with him putting kids in danger by taking them through the forest, makes no sense what so ever and is an illogical reaction. 

&gt; The original dispute was whether Danny was right to prioritise the kids. He absolutely was.

Too many people think that we're back in the Hodgeson era and are yelling at Brendan as if he said ""Liverpool are not too big for a relegation battle."" Frankly, i've been around here during worse times so our team dragging themselves to 6th place after 9 league games with the team we have now doesn't really faze me too much. Balotelli needs to find his form, it's taking him a lot longer than we expected but he'll get there. Sturridge will heal. Hendo, Allen, Gerrard, Couts, Lallana and Markovic have all proven themselves last season and after they learn each other will hopefully prove themselves again this season. Can is also promising and Sterling put Ronaldo-esque numbers up last season and still shows the spark this season. Our team literally has insane young talent, thats not an exaggeration. The players we bought for this season are far from mediocre, with the one on the lowest end of the spectrum of players we bought being Lambert, but we never bought him to be the greatest striker in the world anyway. We have the depth to compete in all the competitions we are now in. If we just bought players like Falcao and di Maria we would be essentially forcing the rest of our squad to play an insane amount of minutes. The prices were fine, barring maybe Markovic if he doesn't start preforming. The other players will preform in due time, there have been flashes of the squad clicking (eg: Tottenham and West Brom). The problem is that the attitude on here is like we are on the lower half of the table. Hell, I've seen Tottenham fans on /r/soccer with a better attitude than people here, and they're 11th. 

Suarez was immense, yes. We were always going to miss him, and anyone who said otherwise would be fooling themselves. But the quality in the squad right now we can depend less on one player and be able to have a well rounded team which we need. Our defense is probably the most disappointing aspect right now, with no improvement over the summer. But obviously losing your best player in the team is going to take some time to bounce back no matter who you are. Barcelona lost Messi to injury a couple of seasons ago and even they looked almost toothless in attack. We're not 'building' a team, nor are we going through another 'transitional' season. Sturridge will come back soon, we are going to look better forward with him, Balotelli will have a striker that can show him how to play under the Rodgers system and we will probably bring the midfield diamond back.

This is wrong. No professional manager sets a team up to try to snatch late winners as a Plan A, week in and week out. I can't imagine how the team talk would go, this just baffles me

AVB: ""Right lads,it's Burnley this week, so sit back smash and grab as usual - defend the 18 yard box, try to concede possession as much as possible and about 85 minutes in we'll bomb up the pitch and try to scramble a cheeky winner""

Doesn't seem likely. The guy won a treble in Portugal (undefeated in the league), set our then-record league points tally and went 18 games unbeaten with Zenit just recently. Those are objective facts.

&gt; Harry Kane...has never quite impressed me against premierleague opposition.

It's probably worth considering that Harry Kane has only played about 60 minutes of league football so far this season. He doesn't get a great deal of opportunities. It takes a certain level of player to be a super-sub, who can change a game by only playing the last ten minutes.

&gt; I didn't think Mason was very good at all. Saying this, the team were poor collectively

He was just one component of a poorly peforming team today.

&gt; Dier should be loaned out

I agree with this. He clearly needs a bit more development time but it's not his fault. He's playing regularly through circumstance at the moment, playing at right back because there's nobody else around to do it. Depending on the injury status of the two Kyles, I would think Ryan Fredericks would be worth recalling from loan. (hopefully he doesn't end up being another Lewis Holtby)

&gt; Sig should have still been sold...the cut at tottenham is too high for him

I think you're probably over selling the current abilities of Tottenham. Sig probably should have been sold if he definitely wasn't going to be playing. But it still seems a bit short-sighted to have gotten rid of him.

&gt; Sadly, I can't see CL being achieved through league placement for a very long time.

false,rishichico,num23,,"Okay, I was at the match today and I'm also majorly pissed off! A Few problems to sort out. 

* When Dier and Rose have the ball in the opposition half, they are isolated. Rose has the speed and skill to take them on a few times, but we are not gonna get shit out of Dier. They need to be supported. Some sort of overlap, 1 2 or even a route out. Once we have Walker (even Yedlin) back we can expect some injection of pace so things may change.

* Lamela needs to realise that sometimes in life you can pass the ball to the right. He always comes in from the right and it's really predictable. He then gets crowded out. He always positions himself really centrally! Not sure if this is Poch's tactics, but surely if there is space on the flanks, and believe me there is, you'd exploit it. 

* Because our midfield offer no width what so ever, I mean virgins are wider than us at times, Ade ends up floating around near the wings. If he's there, who's scoring? His positioning on the flanks is actually decent, **if** he was Chadli/Lamela. 

* No one makes runs. We are so static, it makes us easy to defend against. Lamela and Chadli need to drive the channels and push players back. Not once was there any real threat of us getting in behind the Newcastle back line. They always come to the ball rather than having faith the ball will come to them. 

We have to go shopping in Jan. We need some PACE. I'm talking raw pace. Because we don't have any. Lamela, Chadli and Eriksen are quick, but a defender like Clichy or Ivanovic will deal with them all day. 

What we also need is some pace up front. All of our strikers offer nothing in the space behind the opposition back line. I want a striker that can just run into the other half on a break. Ade has to wait for backup, by that time the opposition recover with a few numbers.

Got caught unawares at the start of the 2nd half, and Ameobi finished really well, and from then on Newcastle had a bit more spark and we just looked flat. Just a typical bad performance, nothing too out of the ordinary.

And thats why I don't get all the outrage. I don't understand what people have been seeing to suggest that we should always be winning these games. Yes on paper we have a much much better squad then Newcastle, but we have not been playing great. People just need to chill out and accept the team for what they are, and stop criticizing all the players for supposedly not giving a shit. Maybe Dier was just...you know...tired because he has played an absurd number of minutes and isn't even a rb. Maybe Lamela is still pretty fucking raw and shouldn't be expected to put on a show every game. 

Everyone is saying Poch did shit with the team selection and subs, but is that such a surprise. He has been here for 4 months. 4 fucking months. How is he supposed to know every player and what works best with that time. I'm not saying he is free of blame but come on guys, stop freaking out. I am in love with this team just like everyone and this game absolutely sucked to watch. I turned it off at the 80th minute because I just couldn't deal with it anymore (also, the commentators on NBCSN were driving me nuts, which is usually the case when we are playing badly) and I could just tell that we weren't gonna make anything happen. Its just the way it is and the way its gonna be till we manage to get things going again, whether that be through a greater squad cohesiveness, different players, or just time to adjust to what we are trying to do, everyone just needs to take the team for what it is. We play some good sometimes, play shit other times, and we will usually get beaten by the bigger teams. Sorry for the rant, this place after a loss can just be a real shit hole. Stuff like the 09/10 season ruined us is just such a fucking stupid thing to say. Clubs have ups and downs, and we don't nearly have enough resources to just permenently stay up. Fucking Villa was top 6 7 years ago. We were bottom half 7 years ago. Look how that changed? I know we all want to be optimistic and that is great, I always go into a game hoping and honestly part of me expecting a win. I enjoyed the shit out of the Man City game because we looked pretty good I thought except for some defensive shitiness.

So yea, we were just flat. Lamela lost the ball all the time, Dier was tired, Danny Rose can't really defend a cross, Adebayor was typically a bit sub-average, Chadli was quiet, I thought Eriksen and Capoue played fine. We have this terrible habit of pushing our rb and lb so wide and forcing them to play really awkward balls from the line around half-field. When we are in our own half the rb and lb should be a bit more central, and have Lamela/Chadli be open on the wings, and have someone be in the center. Because the way we do it now we play Dier on the wing, and he just has to kind of hit it up the line hoping Lamela can control it when half the time he will lose it, and because of the awkward positioning Dier can't really play it to the center. Lamela and Eriksen are also on eachothers toes a lot of the game. We just still have a lot of problems in how we play, and it showed today. Sorry for the rant. 

Edit: To the guy who said they can't be bothered running. Maybe its cause half of them played 90 minutes 3 days ago..........quit acting like they all don't give a shit, and that our problems can just be fixed with a stern talking to.

There are no school nights for me at the moment lovely. I'm on ESA. I'm still getting up at 7am most days and doing pretty much a full day's work with various, pretty tedious things though. Feel like I could do with a holiday, which sounds pretty pathetic really, but constantly dealing with doctors, lawyers, the council (not to mention ebay, who seem to be going out of their way to make it as difficult as possible for me to make money) is fucking exhausting. Then in between I do most of the housework for all of us because they're letting me stay here for free (no complaints about that though).

On a positive note, I get ages to play around with makeup in the mornings, so I've got that going for me. Plus there are lovely cats and sometimes lovely dogs here :)

I thought he was spot on. We are playing a formation which demands that the wide players, Sterling and Lallana in this case, push wide in order to pull defenders wide. The way Sterling and Lallana kept making runs and drifting in to the centre meant that there was little to no space and that Balotelli had to push wide. At times there were 3 vs 7 as we were pushing forward. 

I hope for the Newcastle game that we play Coutinho and Sterling with either Balotelli or Lambert through the centre (unless Sturridge is fit to start!). I think BR needs to sit down and have think about why we are getting bogged down through the middle so much.

Two sides to it. A) I find Clara's reaction acceptable and B) I find Danny's reaction illogical. A person can have opinion about multiple things, who would have known!

Just going to give few examples - Tadic £10 last season 33 matches 16 goals 14 assists, so far this season 1 goal 7 assists, Kroos £24m last season 11 matches 1 goal 2 assists, so far 5 assists. Sterling putting Ronaldo-esque numbers? Really? Ronaldo last season 30 matches 31 goals 9 assists, Sterling last season 24 matches 9 goals 5 assists. Close enough?

I've never said that I want big names, I just want something that is at least similar. What we have? Borini, Lambert and Balo. Amazing. Flashes of good playing? 2 games from 9. Is this really the Liverpool you want to see? When Sturridge was fit during pre-season, Brendan again played with one forward. I don't think he will put Balo and Sturridge together for more then a half time when we are down already. He is just that stubborn. Try and open your eyes and see what other teams have and what we have. I still can't understand how 0-0 with a 30min good play against Hull at Anfield is considered a positive thing?

CCTV, mobile phones, orbital satellites (some of which no doubt got burned to a crisp after the solar flare) - there's plenty of automatic record keeping going on. Are we really to believe that people are just going to forget all this stuff?

Think that's definitely an indication of Champions League hangover and clubs that have a period of greater-than-usual success. Even at my local club Cambridge United, where we've made it into League 2 for the first time in over a decade, the fans are getting full of themselves and if we play well but slip up to an established league side they denounce the team and single out players who aren't ""up to league standard"". Motherfucker if Cambridge finish 22nd in the league and avoid relegation, that's success.

Same with Spurs, and I think eventually we'll either get back into the Champions League (and therefore be performing well) or we'll return back to our upper/midtable spot and plastics will return to watching rugby, leaving the core fans alone.

Second time, I'd got the plan ready. We entered the shop, and I ran like a mother fucker. I ran all the way round to the kids crap. Beds, teddies all that shit. Dude, it's like a wonderhouse in there. Grab a handful of teddies and go play on the beds. Fuckin slides and shit everywhere.

Now, it gets a little risky. You are about to get bollocked by the staff (probably some big bearded swedish viking dude) for running around a kids play area with teddies and jumping on beds and shit. You need to word things carefully so as not to become a paedo.

But, get it right. You'll have some mild mannered laughing big swedish blokes asking the missus never to bring you back.
