I don't understand this whole need for everything to be fully explained though. Why? Why do you need every detail and action explained. 

Here's why I have to disagree. When fans make up their own explanations that's better than making it solid. I'd rather an open text with multiple interpretations rather than one with every detail explained and no wriggle room for anything.

The media will happily feed them bullshit and in the UK this means scapegoating immigrants for all of society's problems.

Football:

Though popular for many years with European footballers like Gianluigi Buffon — in the 2010–11 Premier League season, a number of high-profile players including Carlos Tevez and Samir Nasri wore snoods. The fashion was derided by commentators, prompting one journalist to state that 'snoods are the new gloves' in professional football.

Whereas former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said he would no longer allow his players to wear snoods, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended their use, suggesting they serve a medical purpose when players have neck problems in the cold weather.

The International Football Association Board feels that snood scarves may pose a risk to a player's neck if jerked from behind. Players in the UK have been banned from wearing them during matches since 1 July 2011. IFAB had a meeting where the issue was brought up, and they were immediately and completely banned on 5 March, 2011 due to not being part of the uniform.",0,1412968992,null,0,false,0,cl5xvhp,t3_2iusdp,t1_cl5xvhp,t1_cl5xmjv,null,1426589776,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Hopefully this signals some genuine momentum, putting pressure on the home office to change their official position and recognise Palestine's statehood. It all depends if we have the nuts to stand up to Israel (USA) though. I don't think it will happen under this government.

It probably *does* depress wages a bit, but not by much. And there's plenty of anecdata about employers not being able to find natives willing to do some work. Note that to be an immigrant at all you've shown a willingness to move to find work, whereas there are lots of natives unwilling to do so because they think they have a right to live where they grew up.

And meh to the EU. Yes, us being members of the EU makes it easier for people to come here to work, but it makes it just as easy for people to go from here to abroad to find work. Again, it boils down to people being unwilling to look for work outside their local area.

Leaving the EU.  
Reducing taxation.  
Replacing the Barnett formula with greater level of tax autonomy in Scotland.  
A greater emphasis on individual rights and responsibilities. Specifically abolishing the human rights act and allowing people to, for example, refuse to allow gay people to stay in their guest house
More spending on the armed forces.

This is off the top of my head without reference to the website.

O'Brien managed to completely annihilate this guy, but even if he convinced him, that means that UKIP only has a 12067 votes more than Labour in Clacton rather than 12068. He's just a supporter.

It's quite possible for us all to disagree with each other and still get along but there are many who cannot fathom another person holding a different view, let alone admit that the person may be correct.

My greatest issue above all is the complete lack of reddiquette displayed sometimes by left wing people, being the dominant strata in the sub towards anyone with a right wing view. Often any comment that supports the obvious left wing position is upvoted tremendously with any right wing view either ignored or downvoted and usually the latter.

I support UKIP and yet even though I've been far more polite, posted sources to back up my convictions and gone into great detail in some of my posts, I've been downvoted through whole comment chains, while I upvote them. My crowning moment of glory being an essay length explanation of my views on Rotherham being downvoted because I challenged the prevailing view that such horror just didn't happen, lalala can't hear you, multiculturalism's fine!

But I digress, friendliness for the sake of it is pointless because then we get a hug box. No ones views are challenged because people are too afraid to point to the elephant in the room and don't want to above all *hurt someone's feelings*. The only thing this sub needs more is a more intelligent application of reddiquette but we can't have that until the majority of users start respecting opposing views.

The logic being that when you move, you will be moving within the market, and so valuation shouldn't be your primary concern.

People confuse buying their primary residence with an investment. It is not an investment, unless you somehow plan to capitalise on its value.

There are some general points;

* How long do you plan to live there? Generally if you own somewhere for less than five years the costs of buying/selling can outweigh any benefit over renting.
* Owning a house is more than just the mortgage cost. The roof breaks, it's on you. The shower needs replacing, it's on you. A lot of the cost in rental is effectively due to convenience.

We're obsessed with property ownership in the UK (I can't talk, having bought my first house pretty early on), and in general it's considered to be a good idea. I'd only be worrying about valuation in a major way if I thought the area I was in was bubble conditions.

This may sound stupid, but have you tried going to your local town hall? (Wherever the misper went missing) They're typically clued in in regards to radio chatter and mispers (missing persons).

They're also usually good in regards to keeping track of homeless, offenders, etc. So they will typically notice a new report of an unknown person in the area.

Wherever they went missing, find the local council offices and ask them who controls the CCTV. The CCTV control centre will have logs any time they monitor a person, and this may help immensely if you can narrow down the time window.

Ulster resistance rally chaired by DUP member Sammy Wilson, also addressed by Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson. Ian Paisley pledged his full political support to Ulster Resistance. 

At another rally, Peter Robinson is quoted as saying: 

""Thousands have already joined the movement and the task of shaping them into an effective force is continuing. The Resistance has indicated that drilling and training has already started. The officers of the nine divisions have taken up their duties"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Resistance#cite_note-5

Collaborated with the UVF, Red Hand Commando, and UDA to get guns. These guns were intercepted in Markethill. Lets remember who was at the top of the pile of Ulster Resistance. 

This is only one instance, there were others. Todays DUP top brass gave their full support to Ulster Resistance until they were found out by the British, then they wiped their hands off it for political gain.

Another example: 
""Moreover, while Paisley condemned Loyalist attacks on Catholics throughout his career, in the Eighties he flirted with the prospect of Protestant “people’s militias” and once conveyed journalists to a hillside in Co Antrim at night to witness 500 men in military formation brandishing firearms licences. Loyalist paramilitaries criticised him for inciting them to violence, then distancing himself when it occurred. ""
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11092046/Lord-Bannside-obituary.html

That last quote is my very point. But now I'm going to go one further and say Ian Paisley and the DUP actively condoned and the militarisation of the loyalist community and were even involved in finding guns for them.

&gt;The truth is, however, this is most definitely not the sort of stunt we’d pull. For starters we would not base a joke around soldiers in conflict. 

But racist slurs are all in good jest!

&gt;We would have had to gather the whole team and say: “Sod what the cars are for this trip, just find one that’s registered with a number plate containing 982 and FKL.” The plate was a genuine plate, remember, not one we made up.


Or you were looking for cars, spotted one with an amusing number plate and went for it. 

&gt;Right. Do you know how many Porsche 928GTs there were for sale when we were looking? Two or three, tops. The odds of one having the number plate we “wanted” are millions to one. The plate was genuine, remember, not one we had made up.


No. There was one, we know this because we've seen it. The point is you picked it. 


&gt;I explained all this to a chap from one of the national newspapers and he came back with a good question. “OK,” he said, “if it wasn’t deliberate, why didn’t you spot it and do something about it before you left the UK?”



Or you did, and you thought, that'll be one of the laughs. 

&gt;getting the cars bought, mechanically checked for time-bombs and shipped to Argentina, with all the paperwork that endeavour requires.

I'm sure the episode will reflect that all the cars were checked to make sure nothing was wrong with them before leaving. 

&gt;when Jeremy was scrolling through Twitter and spotted a comment on one of the auto fan sites, next to a photo of the plate. I remember his surprise and concern.

Yeah, sounds just like Jeremy, surprise and concern, the shy retiring type. 


&gt; (Weirdly, although he’s chased them, the Telegraph has so far not bothered to print his letter.)

Because the telegraph doesn't have any reason to publish letters from one of clarkson's employees protesting clarksons innocence. 


&gt; and it was at this point – not before we left London – that we decided to get the BE11 END plates made for Jeremy’s car for the football match in the town.


So you do make number plate jokes? or you don't?

&gt; They didn’t believe us, told us to leave town or face the consequences, we did that very thing and drove into a night of violent terror.

Yeah, I can't blame them.

So the net 250,000 immigrants per year don't need housing? Oh wait...

Even if we assume that they're living 5 to a house (they're not, but anyway), that's 50,000 houses taken off the market each year by immigrants alone, almost half the amount built per year. They may not be the sole cause of the problem and I absolutely agree that the government should be building more houses and encouraging the private sector to do the same, as well as planning laws being lifted to remove barriers, but they very heavily compound the problem.

&gt; No, immigration has fuck all to do with benefits fraud. 

EU migrants can come here and claim benefits from day one and they do. That is wrong, full stop.

Equally health tourism (ok, fair enough not benefits, I should've been clearer), costs hundreds of millions per year. 

&gt; there's plenty of anecdata about employers not being 
able to find natives willing to do some work.

There's also anecdotes of over 1,000 applications to jobs at coffee shops. I'm sure there are people who think themselves too good for certain jobs, but then that's an issue regarding benefits being too high (and minimum wage being too low). No job should ever be less favourable than being unemployed. 

&gt; they think they have a right to live where they grew up.

They have a right to live where they want presuming they can afford it. Whether they can afford it is a different problem. 

&gt; people being unwilling to look for work outside their local area.

Because, surprisingly, the UK is a much more desirable place to live and work than Romania, Latvia or most of Eastern Europe, as well as Spain, Italy etc. It's not surprise more people come here than leave, do you really expect one of the wealthiest, most generous (in terms of social welfare), most respected countries in the world to have 0 net migration in an open borders environment? If so, you are incredibly stupid.

&gt; It's a racism problem.

I was wondering when that was coming. I'm not exactly sure how it's racist to want to curb immigration regardless of race, religion, nationality or any other identifying factor. I have no idea how it's racist to want to choose the best candidates to come to this country based purely on merit and what they can contribute, not discriminating in favour of those born in Europe.

If anything, the EU policy is ""racist"" because it discriminates against those from outside the EU. But then, European/non-European isn't a race so that's not accurate.

Do you not remember the Petrol Crisis thingy a few years back? 

When there was no petrol in stations for miles around and there was no bread in the shops?

I live in the South West. We had terrible flooding in 2007.

 It caused fucking chaos. 

For weeks.

There were stranded people sleeping in community centres. 

The pensioner who lived above me was, like all elderly and disabled people, considered vulnerable and was brought round a box of tinned salmon, tinned potatoes and wetwipes by a policeman.

 You could not flush your toilet. There were water bowsers on street corners. 

There was a mini riot which had to be cleared with armed police outside Asda in Gloucester ( That was where they were handing out the free drinking water - the Glosser Locals thought that the Asians were taking more than their fair share intending to sell it afterwards )

 Who are you to laugh at someone who experiences events like this and thinks, Well, maybe a jerrycan of petrol ( carefully rotated and used, yes most people can read simple instructions and look after things they have bought )in the garage and plenty of tinned stuff in the larder, etc might be somewhat sensible? 

A lot of the Prepper's Kit and Training is your basic camping and outdoor stuff anyway, so at least it gets people out in the fresh air enjoying the countryside as well. 

It can be quite fun as well, to learn new skills, etc. I was down a cave AND dangling off cliffs only today in fact, practising abseiling and other SRT techniques with a member of the Gloucestershire Cave Rescue Team. 

What physical and mental limits did you push this afternoon?

I know it doesn't change anything - I'm totally with you, this are some mad skills. In the hypothetical scenario of having to grade this student, I'd definitely give him a super A triple-plus on the assignment and a gold medal. But only because of the brilliant execution and nothing else.

Not at all, the UK has been desirable for many decades, way before the EU, see all the immigrants in the 50s/60s from the Carribean and commonwealth...the UK is seen as a very tolerant, affluent society where there's opportunities to flourish unlikely in many other countries. We have free health care, free education, world class tertiary education, London, arguably the world's services sector hq, and moderate politics. None of these are due to the EU.

Long working weeks are irrelevant if people are happy to work hard (as they should be), and we also have more generous holiday than many other nations. High housing is one of the main causes of a high cost of living, alongside high food prices which are both greatly exacerbated by the EU, leave them and we'll see them fall. Furthermore, compared to the massive upgrade in both wages and living standards for someone from Eastern Europe (or anywhere that isn't a highly developed economic country), the costs are not as much of a jump.

But for the sake of argument, let's come up with some other number plates that are offensive: FKL and FLK are pretty interchangeable. Still though, say I sit here and come up with 100 potentially-offensive number plates: 10,000,000/100 = 100,000 so that's still a 1 in 100,000 odds of Clarkson getting a number pate that's offensive.

I'll admit that Argentina are taking the piss by trying to draw conclusions with the other number plates, that are +/- 60 of the death toll of each side, and as I said originally, they should stop bitching altogether, but are the odds of Top Gear deliberately causing offence in this way really less than 1 in 100,000? Considering their slant joke in the last special? Or all the other controversies?

Furthermore, given the amount of research they do into these trips, they should know not to bring such plates in, and they're not blind so they would have seen it, *and they know how touchy Argentina is about the Falklands*, so why didn't they take mitigating measures and buy another old Porsche, if they actually cared? Or get a different number plate? They've got the money to take the cars halfway down the world after all, how much extra is a new car or number plate?

false,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"Lolno. Oh god, best/worst night of my life. I've never met a man who's made my whole body hurt from laughing since, damn it. 

I took him to my favourite crazy bar; the landlord is insane. Every Friday without fail, everyone's drumming all the things (he brings out loads of drum sticks), dancing on tables, wearing silly wigs and having a jolly time of it (lock ins ftw). He wanted to see me dance on the table so I obliged. In three inch boots. Now here's the thing, I wasn't that drunk at all. But the table I was on was a shitty little kids' type one and wasn't made well. Coated mdf. I lost my footing, dove off the table and smacked it just under the knee bone onto the table opposite. Ouch! No biggie though, right? We stole Guinness and sat in the park to carry on laughing. By the time we returned to mine, a lump the size of a small grapefruit had appeared on my leg, and he had to nurse it with frozen peas.

Over the course of the next six weeks, the leg went black, purple, brown, green, yellow. The entire leg. From knee to ankle. I couldn't wear skirts cos not even 40 denier would hide it.

I'm not suggesting we shouldn't treat this woman, the NHS exists to treat UK citizens and if they're unlucky and get HIV and are going to cost us (on average) £18,000 per year in HIV treatments alone then we should pay that money to treat them.

What we shouldn't do is invite lots more people into the country who're going to cost us that every year, because a person would have to earn about 70k just to even pay that £18 back in taxes, before they start even paying for all the other government services they use.

I'm no expert in any of this so this is just my suggestions...!

So there's a few steps to go through, but from the sound of the neighbours the first ones aren't going to do much good but you should do it anyway just to show that you've tried the reasonable things first.

So first of all there's going to talk to them as someone may have done something unknowingly, not realising they didn't have the right to, etc.

However if it's not possible to have a calm and reasonable conversation which seems to be the case from what you've described then the next step would be to put it down in writing instead. Write a letter outlining the issues and probably best to include a photocopy of the deeds showing the land boundary. That is sufficient to ensure you're in a situation where you've done your due diligence in letting them know that what they're doing isn't allowed.

So this probably isn't going to get you anywhere either but you never know. Best to make the letter non-aggressive but you can outline the steps that you will take if they don't stop it - that is, putting in a civil court case against them. Even if you think you wouldn't be able to carry this out for whatever reason it's probably still a good idea to say you will just in case that's what it takes to give them that nudge they need!

Now, after this you probably want to go ask citizens advice, who will hopefully be able to give some advice on what you can do. This is free and they should be used to stuff like this so they can probably give some practical suggestions, however they'll suggest the above first (so you can let them know that's all been done already). And then they'll probably suggest the below, but again I'm no expert as I said, and they might have some other ideas too.

But then finally with all those things exhausted you would unfortunately have to take the legal route.

Even with the councillors if they were in agreement that it was wrong they might go speak to the neighbours too but if they continue to be defiant there's not much else they'd likely do at that point anyway and you'd still be stuck with taking it to court.

It's unfortunately that is can be a lot of hassle going this far with anything, but that's what the courts are there for, unfortunately.

One other thing too regarding land boundaries on deeds... it's often not just as clear cut as showing a map as proof. Basically these maps are usually tiny and don't give exact measurements of land. It's even possible that neighbours have deeds showing overlapping portions or portions so close that it's hard to see where the boundary lies. Sometimes they will list physical  things like slopes, rocks, trees, etc. to identify the boundary. In the absence of anything like this where you have to go off a way-too-small map you might find that there's a few yards margin for error, but still if it shows that there's some land there then even after a compromised final decision by a court it's not like you'd be left with nothing.

Two other things anyway - first of all demolishing the brick structure is obviously an act of vandalism which you should try and record some kind of evidence of. And also cutting down trees without explicit permission from the council is often a no-no as well... they could potentially be in for a serious fine for doing that even if it was in their own land. Aside from all of the above things you could actually report them for cutting the trees down completely independently of everything else, but depends what other action you're planning on taking anyway.

I'm kinda confused about something too though, you say 6 neighbours have done this... after all these years, did this all happen at once in quick succession or what? Seems strange.",0,1412993352,null,0,false,0,cl68nz5,t3_2iwfjt,t1_cl68nz5,t3_2iwfjt,null,1426584636,3,false,bradford,t5_2s7c7,3

wut. National security and immigration policy shouldn't be connected like that. You can't say that just because a few people with links to terrorist organisations have immigrated to the UK, we should punish the millions of future and current immigrants who contribute to our society. We shouldn't be focusing on stopping terror suspects entering the UK, we should be working with law enforcement across Europe in a more effective manner to catch them before they have a chance to get into Europe at all. It's more effective to pool the EU's resources to combating terrorism across Europe than to focus on stopping them crossing the Channel, which we're already doing fairly well.

false,[deleted],null,null,"He didn't get the actual measurements, as in the precise lengths and angles, by watching Who. He still had to work those out and create that blueprint.

Think about it: Police boxes existed before Who. But when it came time to make Who, the director went to the prop guy and said ""Make me a police box"". That guy then went to his office and was essentially a mini-architect for a miniature building, and then built it (If that; they more likely bought an old scrap one).

Which is exactly what this dude did. He had no previous blueprints, just knew he had to make 'a police box'. So he used all the skills a product designer would use to 'design' and build that police box.

If you choose to think he just got the precise angles and lengths from online, so be it, but then you have to apply that logic to students who make bookcases too. If they didn't cheat, then he must likely didn't - there's probably far more bookcase blueprints online than TARDIS blueprints too.

Actually, link me to ANY set of blueprints that are detailed enough to give every length of wood used in both the skeleton and the shell, along with all the joins used, along with the PDFs of the signage, and I'll believe it's that easy to cheat. Because he most likely had to work all that out by himself, otherwise. ""Slanted roof, 3x2 windows and a mini door for a phone on the front"" is not enough blueprints to eventually make that he did. He needed EXACT dimensions.

If you're saying they're hard to work out? __That's the whole point!__ THAT is what he is being marked on and thus he did a spectacular job as a product designer. My friend did a computer design of Luke's lightsaber once - sure he never made it properly, but he only did it from looking at images of it and slowly honing the measurements.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, Doctor Who needs a whole team of writers. It's so rare that hit shows are written by one person these days. It needs a team of writers some of whom are fans of the show and some of whom have never seen it before in their lives. That's the balance of writing talent it needs.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"First of all I agree that they criss cross their own rules quite a bit and at times it is frustrating but running a show about time travel is invariably going to lead to these issues as time goes on. And I never really felt like just being in the future means you cannot change anything more like you cannot get inextricably involved in the events to the point that you are the event. And we already know about fixed points and fluid ones, and the Doctor can generally tell which is which. And we find out that fixed points can be changed it is just difficult and unravels the web of time. Time-travel rules are almost always complex and difficult, and I am pretty sure the writers will always end up criss crossing their own rules to tell a story.

I do agree that the Daleks and Cybermen should be relied on less but I wouldn't say they are completely one-dimensional. We found out that there are Daleks that even the Daleks fear and put in asylum. We had Dalek Sec, Dalek Caan, and Rusty all prove that somewhere in the Daleks is the capacity to not feel so much hatred (or can at least have an epiphany that shows them what the Daleks really are and turn their hatred that way) which pretty much added a whole new in new dimension to them that was not present in Classic Who. And speaking of Classic Who we learned that the Daleks will even fight each other when the Imperial/Renegade civil war started. 

We have found out that someone with extreme passion can actually partially override the upgrading process in Doomsday. We have seen two different kinds of Cybermen with different backstories, one of which originated on Earth and the other on its twin planet Mondas. They also had different primary goals. The Mondas Cybermen primary goal was to take over the universe, conversion was secondary to achieve this goal. The Cybus Cybermen primary goal was conversion for information conservation and to remove humanoid weaknesses.

I don't think companions dying would necessarily raise the stakes and the stakes were obviously pretty high in Name, Day, and Time of the Doctor. In fact I have heard a lot of people say that they would actually like the stakes to be lowered at times so that not every situation is potentially world ending but still a danger or a threat.

I feel the reason why the Doctor sees certain issues as black and white most of the time is because he is afraid of seeing grey. He wants to be the good man and he feels like if he wades to far into the grey he will lose sight of his moral compass and tread out too far. Drowning the Racnoss wasn't a bad moral choice, it was how he felt doing it that was bad. He was going to watch every last one of them suffer. And he would have drowned had Donna not brought him to his senses. We were horrified by what the Doctor did in The Waters of Mars because he started sounding frighteningly like the Master which is exactly who he doesn't want to become.

**tl;dr I mean there are things I would like to change but the relatively direct and mission oriented villains, the Doctor's sense of morality, and the simultaneous firmness and fluidness of time seem pretty much like the core of what make Doctor Who the show that it is to me.**

Personally my changes are more direct, physical changes. I want there to be a primary male companion or an alien companion, or a companion like Turlough that may have other motives than adventure for being there initially. I want to see the reintroduction of Omega and the Guardians. I would love an intimate episode or more scenes around the TARDIS. I would love to see an episode focused on planet exploration.

We have a great thing going right now and Ronaldo would distract from it because he would naturally need the ball more than Costa, Hazard, or Fabregas because he is that much better. 

Hazard will rarely try a shot on his left foot, which essentially means defenses know what he is going to try when he's played on the right. Rafa played him there frequently and it was painful the difference between him on the left and the right. Ronaldo's play style also means that Azpi will become very exposed, which he can probably deal with, but it does add that extra dimension. 

Meanwhile, Sterling is young, hungry, dynamic, and fast as hell. He is a great player with years ahead of him and would slot into our team much better than Ronaldo would. 

You're right, it doesn't matter because we won't get either, but I just think it's silly that I'm getting downvoted for trying to at least raise the possibility that Sterling would be better for the team long term than Ronaldo would.

Certainly, there are classic doctors who don't fit that mold.  The third and the fifth (while very nearly my favorites) were very warm, human, and predictably heroic, very nearly to a fault.  Most of the others  were just very odd, and you really could not tell what was in his head.

For example, the oft-maligned bit in Kill the Moon (I'm not going into whether I like it or not, that's a tough subject to broach in here) where the Doctor simply decided he wasn't needed and left, very much reminded me of the ending of The Face of Evil, with Tom Baker.  The Doctor's own personal mistake which preceded the story got cleared up, and the result was chaos.  The Tesh and the Sevateem meet up, and are at complete odds in regards to what they should do and how things should be done, and they argue for a bit, and one of the Tesh addresses the Doctor. ""We must still choose a leader!""
""Ah, but that's not my problem.""
And while they argue, he just walks away.  They don't even realize he's gone until Leela turns to ask him something.

The next shot is the Doctor on the way back to the TARDIS, perfectly content, swinging the TARDIS key, and whistling a tune.

- Claiming day one benefits - They only enjoy the same benefits we do if employed, benefits are given depending on circumstance, they only have three months in which they can stay and are booted out if determined unable to pay their way or are not employed. For any benefits from that point they would need to prove habitual residency.

- Benefits fraud - On a whole 70p from every £100 claimed in benefits is fraudulent and rates are higher in the native population. If anything billions in benefits are under-claimed at the moment which goes to show how this is still such a good political tool else politicians would be a lot more quiet on it.

- Take a look at the welfare budget and see just how much goes into pensions and tell me we aren't top heavy. Compare it to the budget for job seekers allowance (it's 15x higher). The immigrants are paying our relatively cushy retirement years yet people are too blind to see it. There's two paths to go, cut immigration or cut everyone's pensions and NHS provisions in later in life care.

- Unemployment is at 2%, not exactly high, the issue lies with exploitative working contracts and an un-liveable minimum wage imo. Employers who employ illegally need to be held to more significant punishment. We could do with relaxation on the red tape required to use immigrants for seasonal work which would struggle without immigrant labour so that individuals with only the plan to work the season can't fall into reliance on benefits after the season.

You are looking at the improbability of one event and concluding that it couldn't have happened because it is so improbable.  

What you should be doing is comparing it with the probability of the best alternative explanation which is congruent with the facts.
Given that this wasn't a specially purchased plate; it's objectively demonstrable that this ""unlikely"" numberplate was part of the very rare car's history - at some point along the line something very improbable *must have happened.*

Because you fail to offer any alternative explanation which is congruent with the facts, a similar analysis of probability can't be done, and therefore all you're left with is the claim that an improbable thing didn't happen because it's improbable - this fundamentally fails as an argument because:

a) whatever your explanation, something improbable *must have happened*

b) improbable things happen all the time

It's similar to the prosecution of Sally Clark in the late 90s.  Two of her babies died of sudden infant death syndrome, and an idiotic doctor called Dr Roy Meadows claimed that the chances of this happening were 1 in 70 million so the only possible explanation is she must have murdered her babies.  Other than the very questionable reasoning of getting to the 70 million figure, he was completely ignoring the fact that a mother double murdering both her children *is also very improbable and rare*.  The fact is that something very out of the ordinary had happened (the death of both her children), and therefore whatever explanation you offer is going to involve something improbable!  

A relevant figure in both these instances is the *comparative probability* of the two possible explanations for an unlikely event, not the *absolute probability* of just one of them.

(My local council is a particularly serious offender).

Magazines are better. Private Eye, for all its sometimes tedious silliness, publishes all sorts of things nobody else will - for example, you won't find accounts of local government corruption anywhere else.

the secret trade deal that's so secret that the government are trying to hide it from the general public by publishing the [details on their website](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership-ttip)

Here is some information about a key part of the TTIP which is [Investor State Dispute settlement (ISDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311247/bis-14-695-investor-state-dispute-settlement-faqs.pdf). This is the part that lets ""companies sue governments for loss of profits"". 

Like many people, when I first heard about this, I thought it was an outrageous corporate takeover of government. Then I educated myself and learned that it's nothing quite so dramatic, fortunately. 

ISDS means that when companies and governments sign a contract over some investment (lets say building a car factory) the company concerned has some form of redress if the government reneges on it's part of the deal. It doesn't give companies any rights *at all* to sue governments for some random loss of profits due to government decisions.

As the second document I linked to makes clear there are already 1000's of ISDS trade agreements with countries all over the world. Number of successful ISDS cases brought against the UK = 0.

Maybe I'm missing something? But it seems to me that this trade agreement is being used to sell newspapers through fear mongering when in reality it's something quite positive and relatively boring.

You also suggest that the way out of poverty was to industrialise further. This honestly baffles me. Britain was already heavily industrialised in most major cities except perhaps London, yet poverty was endemic.

* NARS Velvet Lip pencil, which comes in absolutely gorgeous colours but needs touching up after drinking.
* Revlon Matte Balms, which are super impressive. You can build up the pigmentation and they last for quite a while. 
* Sleek Matte Me, which was terrible and drying.
* Sleek Matte lipstick, which come in amazing colours and are super pigmented.
* NYX Matte Lip Creams, which have gorgeous shades and good staying power.

They may put a keeper in for certain strings of games but I've never seen a top team have a different keeper each week for a specific competition.

Cech will likely be playing only Capital One Cup games and probably FA Cup games later in the season. If he wants to stay, he might get a couple of group stage CL games but I really doubt it.

The DVLA don't use I, O, U, Q, and Z, which is accounted for [in the calculation I linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2id2hs/request_the_odds_that_jeremy_clarksons_license/), because the remaining 21 permutations are used, not 26
2. Give some examples of invalid number plate combinations and I'll factor them into the calculation. The only ones I can think of are things with consecutive letters and numbers, and googling only reveals the newer style of plates' censored types.
So for argument, let's say 111, 222, etc through 999 are banned, and AAA, BBB, CCC etx. are also all banned. So that's 21 + 9, so 30 plates aren't possible, so we're at 130. POO and ASS are also banned, so 32 for now, unless you can name some more.

3. Partially addressed above, I looked on wikipedia and [1-20 are reserved for government use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom,_Crown_dependencies_and_overseas_territories#1983_to_2001), so discount those: now at 152 unusable plates. Not all plates will still be in use, but the original calculation also doesn't include the AAA999A style plates. The A999AAA style plates have been on the road since 1982. Let's say most cars before 1982 are off the road, and ignore up to G, remembering Clarkson got an H-reg.

So we're now at 14 numbers (although Q is valid, but anyway), use 28 for POO and ASS:([14^3 ]-28)*(1000-20) = 2,661,680

5. (5) Yes the vehicle had that number plate for a while, so what? Clarkson wouldn't have cared how many years the plate would have been on the car for, when he picked it (assuming he did the car selection, not someone else). That just means there's a chance that it was accidental, and to my count, that chance is now 1 in 2,661,680.


6.  (6) We'll have to take their word for it on this. As I said previously, they could have been looking through cars, noticed a funny-looking plate on one car, then realised they could make a gag around that. Repeating myself again, they could have planned the route, travel etc., then selected the cars (nothing says they need to pick the cars first). Then they came across one with  funny number plate, and said ""okay we can buy two other cars around this"". I though they then bought two more old Porsches but they didn't, [they just got two old supercars](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/4/1412421478489/Top-Gear-Porsche-with-con-011.jpg), not anywhere near a similar age range. The one with the black number plate could even be pre-1982, and N denotes 1994-1995, whereas H denotes 1990-1991, [which the advert selling the car claims is the actual age](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/09/1412846648045_wps_32_porsche_for_sale_Top_Gear.jpg). So they just bought a couple of other old cars and went with that: they've had many specials dedicated to old supercars, and one old Porsche special where Jeremy also buys a 928 in black, and turns it into a chalkboard by painting it wrong (yes it was also black). Why would the BBC use the exact same car twice for Clarkson? What was the theme for the car types, anyway?

So now you'll say ""why didn't they just buy the plate?"". Well, the obvious reason is for plausible deniability, but when you look closer, it's clearly flimsy. And why wouldn't it be? I bet they doubted they'd ever have to fall back on this contingency. You just know the show footage featured prominent close-ups of the number plate before fading back to the studio or whatever. So, do you have any proof they already knew what sort of car they were looking for, before they found the Porsche 928, [the exact same model and colour previously used in a challenge?](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/L9pPkq7LtpI/maxresdefault.jpg).

So now I've done the maths right, we're at 1 in 2,661,680. And on top of all that, [they found Bellend number plates in his car to draw out the gag](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/09/jeremy-clarkson-top-gear-argentina-number-plates_n_5957182.html), in case you were still considering that they wouldn't go to such lengths for a joke.",0,1413023217,null,0,false,0,cl6g07a,t3_2ivtm0,t1_cl6g07a,t1_cl6epzf,null,1426581178,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Malaria still claims more victims every year than HIV / AIDS, regardless of how easy you think it is to be cured. Malaria is the biggest infectious killer in the world. For millions of people, malaria is a death sentence.

HIV does not ""generally"" come from abroad, not any more. You yourself can do a search for ""HIV clades and regions"" to see just how diverse and variable the virus is. Assuming that HIV is more likely to occur in one population ignores the sheer weight of evidence suggesting that it is far, far more widespread than many people care to admit. However, as I alluded to, those same people are reluctant to acknowledge the fact that HIV is very easy to manage in this day and age.

(Currency fears by externals and speculators would hit scotland hard but because the BoE underwrites Sterling they'd suffer if they let it go) Investors would wait a bit until they got more for their money.

Uncertainty scares greed and all that.

The Scotland-London corporate tax loop would have been cut too. (again chopping into London's value and further undermining certainty)

Would it have been as bad as the no campaign said in scotland*? 

Nope. that's pure bullshit... always was. 

Would things have been painful? Yeah, maybe for about 5 years leaving the rest of the UK overall worse off considering London's financial basis would have just lost a chunk of it's value.

&gt; We believe that Britain is good enough to be an independent nation

Of course it is, but does that mean it will 'rebuild prosperity' to turn your back on the 440 million odd people who live next door.


&gt; We are the EU’s largest export market

At the moment, we aren't an EU export market:  We're still in the EU!


&gt; they depend on us for jobs - not the other way around.

The other way around is that we depend on them for quality of life.


&gt; at the public’s request

So we'll have referenda on when to have referenda, or what?


&gt; Save £55m a day in membership fees

It's well-known that this figure doesn't count money that comes back into the UK via rebates, grants and whathaveyou.


&gt; 800,000 jobs we currently advertise to EU workers.

UK workers are EU workers.  This is a reference to the following [website](https://ec.europa.eu/eures/page/homepage).  The problem here seems to be where British employers advertise their vacancies and restricting that seems to contradict their policy of 'independence from government interference'.


&gt; all green taxes and wind turbine subsidies

Nothing says 'patriotism' like destroying the environment.


&gt; abolish inheritance tax

Simply regressive.  I can't even see how there's a debate here.


&gt; Remove the UK from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.

This is a big issue, but I can't help thinking it's only here because it has the word 'European' in the name.


&gt; Open GP surgeries in the evening, for full-time workers

Are GPs going to have to ask for evidence of your employment contracts when you book an appointment?


&gt; Prioritise social housing for people whose parents and grandparents were born locally.

Again, how are you going to get the evidence for this?  I don't have any of my grandparents' birth certificates.  And how locally?  My four grandparents were born in four different towns/cities across England and Wales, so am I entitled to social housing in all of those places or none?


&gt; Allow the creation of new grammar schools.

I believe this to be regressive too, but I appear to be at odds with most of the British population on this issue.


&gt; No to Political Correctness

What does this even mean?  What kind of legislation are they planning here?  What kind of legislation currently exists supporting political correctness?


&gt; We oppose any other system of law.

This is obviously a reference to Sharia law, which I believe has no official jurisdiction in the UK and exists on a purely voluntary, opt-in basis.  Banning communities from self-regulating like that (in ways which are compatible with British law) doesn't seem like a great advert for less intrusive government.


&gt; Teach children positive messages and pride in their country.

I think most British people already feel positively about their country.  One of the things that makes me happiest about living in this country is that we have very little time for nationalistic bollocks.

I'm capable of explaining what I want for myself thank you very much. You're making up my views to then argue against them as a straw man. If you had a high school student that did something wrong that seriously hurt someone else, it's stupid to say they still shouldn't get punishment. There's also the fact that it's very easy for people to pretend to show remorse, when they don't really feel it at all. You're just making claims without any backup ""people who show remorse won't commit any more crimes"". 

&gt; It was a really unpleasant comment. you're trying to use your anecdote to make me change my mind, just because you think you're somehow better informed because you know the victims of horrible acts. Do you think your opinion is worth more because you worked with LRA victims?

Honestly, it's not too bad, although everyone tells otherwise.

As for advice, I strongly recommend to get private accomodation. Dorms are really expensive, twice or more for a room. Also, stay away from Priory Halls if you decide to rent a dorm room, look into Liberty Point, Callice court or Singer Halls. Those are close to uni and the rooms are good. The first two have en-suite rooms, where you get your own private toilet and shower. Priory Halls is right in the city centre (cathedral just across the street) but the building itself is shit, no kitchens, narrow corridors and so on. 

Other dorms besides these are fine, but they're a bit far away and walking through dark alleys and underpasses isn't fun at 3am on saturday. 

Private houses are available all over the city, but try looking for ones on the East or South-East part, those will be the closest to your faculty. 

Plenty of pubs and a few clubs nearby, an ice rink, cinema and so on. Everything is within walking distance. I lived there for three years and only actually needed to use a car twice or so. Taxis are easily available everywhere. Train station and buses are not too expensive and you can get pretty much anywhere with ease.

This is the real kicker. One of the main benefits of nuclear power is said to be the cost/efficiency, which is supposed to benefit consumers by reducing the cost of electricity. But what has happened here is the government have allowed the price to be set too high. You could say it's so that renewable forms of energy can remain competitive, but what it has actually done is ensure that it can't compete with fossil fuels.

I do have to question your comparison with wind farms though. The turbines themselves are not the only cost involved (The engineering and planning costs, installation, the accessories i.e. power cables etc. and that is before you consider the maintenance costs over the life of the turbines), but you are comparing it with the total project budget of the nuclear plant.

* Lets all now deny it, despite usually admitting and apologising when we're called out

Therefore coincidence is the 'winner' when you apply the razor.

Your probability calculation post is pretty hard to read, so I won't comment on your methods.  Is 1 in 2.6 million the chance of buying a car with the exact number plate, or any number plate that would be equally offensive?

1/ How much cash will go into the ""the ruling classes"" pockets because they have invested personally in say the construction company that is contracted to build a power station and the services that are needed to run it?  

2/ NIMBYism.  I can see 20 odd turbines from where I live.  The countryside looks better with out them - esp those close to areas of outstanding natural beauty where the wind is at its highest.   3000 will be a blot on the landscape with out a doubt.  The plans are to build this thing at Hinkley Point.  I don't live near there and its been kinda trashed already. If its not in my back yard ect.

I have to add here that I would prefer to look at turbines rather than a power station any day and by own gut feeling is that we shouldn't invest in anything apart from green power generation.

No mention of issues with finding appropriate sites for the wind turbines, which is made especially difficult due to NIMBY sentiments.

This is also the first of a new wave of nuclear plants so of course it will be more expensive, and by showing it is a good investment the government can encourage other companies to invest in more plants. Nuclear power also has other benefits for the country, the UK needs to retain expertise with nuclear technology for security and commercial reasons. This would provide jobs to nuclear engineering graduates and ensure we retain the capability and personnel if they are needed in the future. There are also energy security arguments. We have been lucky in the past that we don't rely on gas from Russia thanks to what is available from the North Sea, but this will run out at some point.

If it works, that's a pretty sweet return on the time you invest in setting up a crowdfunding campaign. 

Also, if you're setting up a cat cafe the chances are that you're aiming to appeal to the quirky/hipster/student crowd, who are more likely to take your business to their hearts if you crowdfund than if you get a loan from the evil banks. Childish? Perhaps. But hipsters have money to spend on the things they like, and if you want their money you say the things they like to hear. 

Of course, I don't know for certain that this is what they're doing. The people setting up the cat cafe might just be earnest, reasonably pure-hearted people trying to do something they care about. They might be a little intimidated by a conventional set-up. They might honestly believe that this is the way forward and be trying to pioneer new funding strategies. But equally, they might be aware that crowdfunding can be used quite cynically to get your hands on the hipster pound. Essentially, they could be karma whoring but with actual money.

This one point... First they plan the trip, then they select specific cars, why not do it this way around? Yes I used Occam's razor wrong but as I've said, it's still more likely that they chose the plate than the 1 in 2.6 million chance that they chose it by accident, ignoring the fact that they somehow didn't pick up on it after buying it, if we're truly to believe it was an accident.

I calculated the probability based on number plates allowed (excluding things like POO and ASS), number plates in circulation, permutations available etc. If you're going to pick apart the maths, you need to actually pick it apart, not just brush it off as ""hard to read"". That said, they could have had several offensive combinations. Remember though, that Clarkson's car was a Porsche 928, so any 928 combination can be put down to that. So say we get 20 offensive plates.

But even if we divide that figure by 20, we're still in the range of 1 in 1 million chance, vs. Top gear's previous reputation. They say they wouldn't mock soldiers etc. but they joked about the Vietnam war in the Vietnam episode with that all-american motorbike. They found spare ""Bellend"" plates in the car after it was abandoned, **indicating they planned to joke about the number plate after all**.

What you're telling me, essentially, is that the odds of them planning all this, which isn't exactly a tall order compared to the logistics of arranging the special as a whole (just another little thing to take care of), are LESS than 1 in 1 million? Despite everything they've done in the past.

Sorry, but no chance. As I also pointed out in the other post: Clarkson has already driven a Porsche 928 in a previous challenge. Why would they use the same car model again? They've not one anywhere near enough challenges whereby they need to start reusing cars from 1990... if only there was a specific reason to buy that car...

Edit: also: ""Here's a porsche with a relevant plate, lets buy it and buy two other cars that mesh with it in someway.""

What was the theme for that episode anyway? We've got a Porsche from 1990, a Ferrari-type thing from 1995, and some other American-looking thing from, judging by the black numberplate, pre-1982 (there's that year again, no I'm not implying this is part of it).

You are absolutely right. I was affraid that this was becoming too much of a wall of text and people would just stop reading and downvoting instead of reading. My objective was to discredit nuclear and maybe offer a solution, not offer a solution and discredit nuclear as a side bonus.

However, I did get some links which I replied to someone else earlier that you might find useful regarding your particular concern.

Edit: forgot to read the rest.

&gt; No mention of issues with finding appropriate sites for the wind turbines, which is made especially difficult due to NIMBY sentiments

Offshore wind turbines are ever going. In fact, such a big wind farm would only be possible in an offshore setting!

&gt;That's before we even get started on the rare earth metal requirements for wind turbines

Those rare earth metals that need to be mined can be recycled afterwards! Once a wind turbine is decomissioned, their components don't go to waste, they can be used to create a bigger, more efficient new turbine.

&gt;and all the associated problems with mining and sourcing.

Wind turbines are not that rare-earth metal intensive such as mining suddenly becomes a problem. Not only that, there are turbines already that do not use any of those metals. [Also, do not get fooled by the ""rare"" part of the name](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26687605)

&gt;This is also the first of a new wave of nuclear plants so of course it will be more expensive

Not particularly, Finland's was actually the first one, and it's already 3x over the budget and iirc 10 years late.

&gt;. We have been lucky in the past that we don't rely on gas from Russia thanks to what is available from the North Sea, but this will run out at some point.

I don't follow, are nuclear plants going to replace natural gas?

&gt;We can still invest in wind power and get rid of some of our coal plants.

Grapeseed oil dissolves make-up and impurities and helps improve skin radiance. Packed with moisturising ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamin E, as well as nourishing avocado, apricot and neroli oils, this wash is perfect to use for your morning and evening cleanse.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am intrigued by the concept of gel to oil and impressed by the ingredients list.

**Your opinion:** This is so similar to the NSPA Skin Renewal Gel that I do not see the point in having both. The price point is incredible considering the largely natural base, little water and no mineral oil which are both super cheap ingredients. Beautifully packaged in a box and has a faint fruity scent.

The cleanser goes onto the skin as a super silky rather than greasy oil, yet is far less messy that a regular cleansing oil due to the gel formulation. I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction and it rinses squeaky clean with warm water so IMO is suitable for all skin types except very dry.

Overall it feels, smells and looks very luxurious so I would repurchase as a gift, but probably not for myself as I prefer the pH of the NSPA Skin Renewal Gel. Not yet tested on waterproof mascara, I will update when I have.

**Ingredients:** *""Caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, grapeseed oil, water, sucrose laurate, sucrose palmitate, fragrance, Neroli flower oil, panax ginseng root extract, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, vitamin E, alcohol, sucrose myristate, isopropyl myristate, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, linalool, alpha-isomethyl ionone, limonene, CI 16035, CI 19140.""*

Tests with universal indicator paper at pH 7, not confident this is accurate because the product contains so little water.

You realise that inheritance tax acts as a way of preventing wealth from stagnating, right? That if left unchecked snowballs into rising dynasties of ultra wealthy families? That it widens the gap between rich and poor? Abolishing inheritance tax entirely would be a disaster, so it's off the cards. Not an option. Zip, zilch, out of luck. The argument is in how to tax it, not whether to tax it at all.

I mean sure, I can understand that it might irk you to build up wealth over time and die, only to have a portion of that wealth taken away. But what about generation two? Your child didn't work for that money, and if he dies having effectively only maintained a fortune, what right does he have to decide how it's spent?

From there it becomes worse as more people inherit a snowballing fortune that only the first person who made it might deserve. On the other hand it would be cruel to take all that money away, so we'll just tax it up to a percentage. The higher than inheritance, the higher the percentage. An average person who wants to help their children along in life? Sure, they can have most of your wealth. A multi-billionaire who wants to keep their wealth intact? Well, you're going to be taxed at a much higher rate to keep things fair. Hell, this is *why* we have tax brackets in the first place.

false,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Where on earth did you get a 40% capacity factor?  Even your own link to the capacity factor definition gives wind about 27%.  40% is for prime location wind sites, at best, and with 3000 turbines you're going to be filling up the prime locations pretty quickly.  Christ, the London array has got fewer than 200 turbines.  You'd be averaging [25%](http://www.pfr.co.uk/pfr/3/Renewable-Energy/15/Wind-Power/119/Capacity-Factor/) if you were lucky.  The law of diminishing returns applied to renewable energy generation just as much as it applies to oil, coal gas (unfortunately for us).

If you're going to complain about strike price then you could at least mention that [offshore wind](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/263937/Final_Document_-_Investing_in_renewable_technologies_-_CfD_contract_terms_and_strike_prices_UPDATED_6_DEC.pdf) is £150/mwh, onshore is £95.  Also inflation linked.  You'd do well to have a read up on the outcomes of Germany's energy policy.  The vast amounts of solar are completely fucking up market dynamics, and indeed energy costs in Germany have risen by about 60% in the last 5 years because of the instability.

Your figures for the # of turbines are pretty dodgy as well.  Again, the London array cost about £1.8 billion, for 175 turbines (don't forget you need subsea cables, concrete housings and stuff when building your plant).  Given that most of our best wind potential is offshore, lets assume we'd stick most the turbines out there.  Hinkley C cost about £24 billion, so that's about 13 London arrays, maybe 2300 turbines, London array has a nameplate of 630MW, so 13 of those at 40% gives you 3.3GW.  At a more realistic 25% we get 2GW.

Given the decline in [load factor](http://www.ref.org.uk/attachments/article/280/ref.hughes.19.12.12.pdf), your estimate of 25 year lifespan is probably a bit high as well, significant maintenance/replacement after about 10-15 years seems like it might be quite likely.  So this will reduce the amount of power produced quite significantly.

Then there's the issue of intermittency, which is always a bugbear.  If you want to add in any storage mechanisms (which aren't yet viable on the scale required) then you're going to be adding in a pretty big inefficiency in the middle somewhere.

Wind power is essentially a source of stochastic noise which grid operators need to be able to account for with dispatchable sources like gas turbines.  Adding in a significant amount of wind capacity is going to make the grid [near impossible to balance](http://euanmearns.com/the-balancing-capacity-issue-a-ticking-time-bomb-under-the-uks-energiewende/).The national grid was not designed to accommodate a large amount of intermittent generation, in the absence of large scale highly efficient storage, whacking in a shitload of wind is frankly asking for trouble.  Hell, our current electricity consumption habits aren't exactly in tune with when the wind blows.


This is not to say I think that Hinkley C is anything other than an absolute organisational clusterfuck, that has been mismanaged to a frankly bizarre level, just thank I think a load of your numbers are overly optimistic, and you're giving figures in a vacuum without any context to make a valid comparison.  The fact that the current government are scrambling around in such a panic trying to get work on Hinkley started shows what a colossal mess our current energy situation is in (thanks largely to fuck all investment in power generation since the mid-late 90's).",0,1413030014,null,0,false,1,cl6h51v,t3_2ixrcl,t1_cl6h51v,t3_2ixrcl,null,1426580596,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; Abolishing the Department for Culture Media and Sport

Because it just adds to public sector inflation, thats why. The fact we need an entire department dedicated to such just shows how pathetic our nation has become. Culture, media and sport should be a part of our daily lives and communities. We shouldn't need a department. They should be community driven things - being proud, getting involved in sport to represent your country etc. - please tell me why we need to spend money on this rather than fixing the ills in society? Lets not forget the money spent on this actually helps negate from other areas of the budget as money could be allocated elsewhere. By the way, the Olympics doesn't happen on a regular basis so to use that as part of your argument as well is ludicrous. Maybe we should hold on to the department in the hope of us getting London 2052? It'll totally be worth it. /rolleyes

&gt; UKIP says they will ""amend the smoking ban to give pubs and clubs the choice to open smoking rooms properly ventilated and separated from non-smoking areas"". This is interesting because it's a divisive political topic but also because practically, it's quite hard to ensure that there's no risk to non-smokers in pubs.

To ensure there is no risk is hard. However, to ensure there is no risk as of current is also hard. I have often left pubs and clubs only to have to filter myself through the smokers area or passed it to get a nice whiff of smoke in my face as I leave. If you had a room dedicated to smokers then you'd probably get the same occurring when the door opened. Solution? Different exit points and ensuring the premises has the appropriate air control in place to stop smoke spreading to other areas of the pub such as a non smokers area.

I don't mean to imply you're wrong, I'm just saying I couldn't work out which assumptions you'd made so I'm refraining from agreeing or disagreeing.  For example I couldn't tell if you were factoring in how the number plates are generated, or that not every legitimate combination of plate is issued every year (for example less than 2 million new plates were registered in 91).

Good that you asked, because I actually forgot to link a source! Here you go: http://cleantechnica.com/2012/07/27/wind-turbine-net-capacity-factor-50-the-new-normal/

As you can see, not only is 40% the median value, modern wind farms are already going for 50%.

&gt;Your figures for the # of turbines are pretty dodgy as well. Again, the London array cost about £1.8 billion, for 175 turbines (don't forget you need subsea cables, concrete housings and stuff when building your plant). Given that most of our best wind potential is offshore, lets assume we'd stick most the turbines out there. Hinkley C cost about £24 billion, so that's about 13 London arrays, maybe 2300 turbines, London array has a nameplate of 630MW, so 13 of those at 40% gives you 3.3GW. At a more realistic 25% we get 2GW.

25% is not realistic for offshore wind farms, the source I linked shows that and even your first link says:

"" although there are wind farms in the UK with capacity factors in excess of 40% because of the good wind resource.""

&gt;Given the decline in load factor, your estimate of 25 year lifespan is probably a bit high as well, significant maintenance/replacement after about 10-15 years seems like it might be quite likely. So this will reduce the amount of power produced quite significantly.

Not true, modern turbines are more durable than previously thought and actually expected to have a &gt;25 year lifespan    
http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/02/25/3325551/wind-turbines-durable/

&gt;Then there's the issue of intermittency, which is always a bugbear. If you want to add in any storage mechanisms (which aren't yet viable on the scale required) then you're going to be adding in a pretty big inefficiency in the middle somewhere.

This is called the ""baseload"" myth, it's debunked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsgrahFln0s)

&gt;The national grid was not designed to accommodate a large amount of intermittent generation, in the absence of large scale highly efficient storage, whacking in a shitload of wind is frankly asking for trouble. Hell, our current electricity consumption habits aren't exactly in tune with when the wind blows.

In this context it means that it's naïve to believe that just because there's a lot of money invested into something does not necessarily means it will return a profit.

&gt;I'm not sure why the video is relevant 

It was meant to illustrate that, since the plant is in UK land and funded by UK taxpayers and if something happens it will be UK people who get screwed, then perhaps they'd be the first reaping those &gt;10% profits.

&gt;Digging a big hole and burying it underground

Funny that you linked to the waste disposal method of a nuclear power plant that's 3x over budget and 10 years overdue, further goes to prove my point. However, your link does not factor the costs of displacing nuclear waste to that hole and making sure it's properly sealed (probably because the plant isn't even online)

&gt;Are offshore farms more expensive? 

Well that depends. For small farms, yes. However, the bigger the investment is the lower the £/KWh becomes because wind blows much more often offshore than inshore, so that balances out the additional costs of installing them at the sea.

That's fair enough, sorry. And I'm afraid that my A-level statistics, that really annoying unit of maths that's oh-so-easy to forget that it's actually hard, has kind of waned :/ I don't know how I would even begin to calculate the number plates based on their algorithms, I did in fact just remove the invalid combinations and calculate the odds on that. I assumed no number plates before ""G"", on the assumption that the existing models still retaining number plates from pre-1990 are too few and far between to count.

Although the fact that less than 2 million new number plates were issued in 91, doesn't change it much, as the H in the plate wasn't really part of it. They could have bagged an ""R982FKL"" or some other year and it wouldn't have changed it.

But about your ""least amount of steps"": Does ""coincidence"" count as just one step? Because then every conspiracy ever, even the ones that turned out to be true, could be fobbed off before being proven with ""it's less steps for it to be a coincidence"". Yes it is less effort for them to have bought a car and for it to happen to have such a number plate, by the unfathomably unlikely odds, but again,[ this is Top Gear](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3268/3153731748_4ff8ce0622.jpg).

I guess we've both already made up our minds about this though. To be honest I could easily give Top Gear the benefit of the doubt, but based on my previous points, and their previous controversies that they've apologised for only after they've come to light, not this time. (makes you wonder how many small controversies were ignored, or how long the big ones were ignored for until they became too big to ignore, too)

&gt; On the upside - at least we both agree the reaction from the locals was completely disproportionate!

Indeed, reading up on the war, it seems like they lost it fair and square, and doing things like training their World Cup team on the islands and claiming them to be ""argentine soil"", I mean ACTUALLY SHIPPING THEM 1000 MILES OUT TO TH ISLANDS TO DO SO...

The whole ""myth of baseload"" thing is a very frustrating thing to see people repeating continually.  If anything most of those studies reinforce the need for baseload, because they constantly rely on CST, hydro or biomass to balance things out.  It's quite nicely taken apart [here](http://decarbonisesa.com/2014/09/14/the-myth-of-the-myth-of-baseload/).  If anything most of the designs proposed in those scenarios significantly increase the complexity of the system, which is something that is best avoided where possible in general.

And the second part is not ""myth of baseload"" reworded.  It's about the inherent difficulty of maintaining grid stability when you're trying to use dispatchable power sources (these are not baseload) to iron out the kinks in supply.  The more noise you introduce to the system, the harder it gets.  In this country we've no opportunity for more hydro or CST technologies for our dispatchable power, so currently we rely on CCGTs, and frankly current policy is going make maintaining grid stability increasingly difficult as the decade draws to a close.

In simple terms, xenophobia means ""fear of the other"" (I'm not a Greek scholar though, so I've probably oversimplified it). In that sense, it applies to the immigration debate in that there are some individuals (not many, just an extreme example to illustrate the point!) who would like to turn away all immigrants simply because they ""aren't British"", ""don't contribute"" and ""don't belong here"".

In a sense I could see the argument for this being a form of *inverted racism* where instead of discriminating *against* one race, one discriminates *in favour of another*, so really it's just an argument about semantics.

The point I was trying to make is that most UKIP voters don't hate the Poles, or see the Bulgarians as a sub-human race (and as such can't rightly be called ""racist"", as such), but many are scared of the effect non-British influence could have on the British society and economy, which I would tend to describe as a mild xenophobic tendency.",0,1413034114,null,0,false,0,cl6i0vs,t3_2ivim9,t1_cl6i0vs,t1_cl62pn2,null,1426580183,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The spiders didn't need to be single-celled organisms, they could easily just be spider-creatures, but suggesting that they are single-celled hints at the moon's nature.  The moon has to be replaced at the end, obviously, even if the mechanics of doing so are ""troubling"".  **The story doesn't add up as it's written unless you turn a blind eye to very obvious problems, so they just turned a blind eye.**  It seems lazy.

I have seen some people write him off as ""another Defoe"". Yes Defoe never seemed to understand the offside rule, yes he never saw a shot he wouldn't take and he was not a very good passer but he was always a direct threat, pressured opponents back lines and most importantly put a fair share of balls in the back of the net. 

I think Berahino has some of those traits now but i think he could develop into a more rounded player given some time and coaching. He seems to have good positioning, makes good runs, is very direct and seems to have the ability to finish. There is something to be said for having a player on the squad who, no matter how frustrating to watch, is always a consistent threat to the opponents back line.

But, I really think he is getting more benefit by being the starter for WBA week in and week out than being a rotational player for any of the teams in the top half of the table.

false,yrro,null,null,"&gt; Unfortunately, there are growing problems with implementation (see article). The clauses that define the scope of ISDS are often insufficiently precise. This has allowed Philip Morris to demand compensation for Australia’s decision to require cigarette-makers to put grisly pictures of lung-cancer victims on their packets. It enabled Vattenfall, a Swedish utility which owns several nuclear plants in Germany, to demand compensation for the German government’s decision in 2011 to phase out nuclear power. And it provides the legal basis for the insistence of Lone Pine Resources, an American oil firm, that the Canadian province of Quebec must compensate it for its moratorium on fracking. Ever more firms see ISDS as a way of getting compensation for, or changes in, unwelcome policies. In 2012 a record 59 arbitrations were launched.

&gt; The manner in which complaints like these are typically resolved makes them all the more galling: the proceedings are not open to the public and the arbitrators making politically and fiscally important decisions are often moonlighting corporate lawyers. It is no surprise that many people believe ISDS stacks the rules of globalisation in favour of big firms.

Don't let a few bad eggs spoil your view of the forces. Of course there are going to be dickheads in the military, but there's dickheads everywhere. The majority of soldiers/sailors/airmen I have met are very decent and professional.

On a side note, I wouldn't think it would be wise to allow any mentally unstable people to join the police (regardless of their past service).

In addition, someone else in this thread stated that military personnel are trained to see civilians as potential threats, although this is true, I don't see how this is relevant. When you are patrolling in Afghanistan where most insurgents are dressed in the same clothes as civilians, it's only safe proceeder to act with caution if a civilian approaches your patrol in a suspicious manor. Very different to being on the streets of Bristol, in fact the training in quick assessment of a situations can benefit police officers, after all anyone can be potentially hostile to police (there's no uniform for criminals).

If anything I would personally see a move to the police from the forces as a natural career move. There's a lot of transferable skills and both the structure of the two jobs are very similar (uniformed, rank structure, protection of the public).

An automatic pass to join the police would be wrong, I agree, but coming from the forces shouldn't hinder your application as some are suggesting in this thread; if anything I would believe it would help.

Most of the time , DW isn't a show about time travel but a show that simply uses it to create settings and nothing more besides that which means that time travel related contradictions are often totally avoidable as long you stay away from Moffat's habit of incorporating time travel into the stories.

Also, this sounds like an alteration of the infamous ""50 year excuse "" people level at critics when they talk about DW's plot holes. The problem is those events and the ones that contradict them , are not 20 year apart or even 10 years apart, they are a few episodes ( weeks,months) apart. It is perfectly humanly possible to write this amount of time travel themed episodes (which is only a minority of DW episodes) without getting messed up. A good example of a show who doesn't fall over itself over the rules of time travel (or at least not as much as DW) is Steins Gates or even the Stewie/Brian episodes in Family Guy.

&gt;I don't think companions dying would necessarily raise the stakes and the stakes were obviously pretty high in Name, Day, and Time of the Doctor. In fact I have heard a lot of people say that they would actually like the stakes to be lowered at times so that not every situation is potentially world ending but still a danger or a threat.

No, it would actually lower them.But that is the point , people are more deeply affected by one little boy they came to know dying  than they are by nameless millions. The reason companions have to die is the same coupled with the fact that they are who we relate to and who we are (in theory) supposed to be most attached to.

&gt;I wouldn't say they are completely one-dimensional. We found out that there are Daleks that even the Daleks fear and put in asylum.

Dalek : Violent crazy killing machine
Asylum dalek: More violent , more crazy killing machine

&gt; Daleks and Cybermen should be relied on less but I wouldn't say they are completely one-dimensional. We found out that there are Daleks that even the Daleks fear and put in asylum. We had Dalek Sec, Dalek Caan, and Rusty all prove that somewhere in the Daleks is the capacity to not feel so much hatred (or can at least have an epiphany that shows them what the Daleks really are and turn their hatred that way) which pretty much added a whole new in new dimension to them that was not present in Classic Who.

The Daleks are still mostly one-dimensional entities just likethe Cybermen occurence, you are  talking about 2-3 cases out hundreds of Daleks and Cybermen. When you look at the Daleks it is even more distressing  because two of them weren't normally constructed Daleks, i.e. one was a human hybrid the other was defective.

&gt;I feel the reason why the Doctor sees certain issues as black and white most of the time is because he is afraid of seeing grey. He wants to be the good man and he feels like if he wades to far into the grey he will lose sight of his moral compass and tread out too far. Drowning the Racnoss wasn't a bad moral choice, it was how he felt doing it that was bad. He was going to watch every last one of them suffer. And he would have drowned had Donna not brought him to his senses. We were horrified by what the Doctor did in The Waters of Mars because he started sounding frighteningly like the Master which is exactly who he doesn't want to become.

The problem is that it is not presented as this is just the Doctor's point of view as being somewhat delusional and obsessed with a being a good man. In the Racnoss example, you gave Donna is the one that says he needs to be stopped whereas the Doctor seems cool with it.And that just makes Waters Of Mars worse , we should be horrified by what the Doctor did, not that he kind of sounds like a villain we know in his speech pattern.",0,1413039523,null,0,1413043490,0,cl6jkms,t3_2iwx9r,t1_cl6jkms,t1_cl6b0uw,null,1426579461,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

*""The American, Charles Brush is often credited with being the first person to use a wind powered machine to generate electricity, which operated for the first time during the winter of 1887. However, earlier in July 1887, Professor James Blyth, a Scottish academic of Anderson's College, Glasgow (which later became Strathclyde University) was undertaking very similar experiments to Brush, which culminated in a UK patent in 1891. Likewise the Dane, Poul La Cour, is known to have constructed relatively advanced wind turbines throughout the 1890s, which were also used to generate electricity which was then used to produce hydrogen.This paper investigates Professor Blyth's life, seeking to understand his motivation to generate electricity from the wind and his association with contemporaries, including Lord Kelvin. The paper argues that it was Blyth and not Brush, who was the first to produce wind-powered electricity.""*

What I *do* know is that other drugs appearing on the market are drastically lowering the cost of treating HIV and slowing down the progression. So wherever the Mail gets its figures from, they're basing it on estimates made several years ago.

The Telegraph also reported last year (2013) about this too...

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10142657/Police-spying-on-almost-9000-extremists.html

Some important quotes from the Telegraph article:

&gt; The news comes as the Metropolitan police face accusations of smearing Stephen Lawrence’s family and secretly bugging meetings with Duwayne Brooks, the main witness to the murder case. 

&gt; It was understood the Met covertly recorded two meetings between Mr Brooks and his solicitor, Jane Deighton, one of which took place at her office. 

&gt; ...

&gt;  His force said it recognised the ""huge seriousness"" of the latest claims about surveillance of Brooks, who is now a Liberal Democrat councillor in South London, and would investigate them internally.

&gt; Former undercover officer Peter Francis revealed the information in a book stating he was involved in the failed operation to discredit Mr Brooks.

&gt; Mr Francis’ unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), was disbanded in 2008, but later replaced with the National Domestic Extremism Unit.

false,Taure,null,null,"There's something of a gulf between possibility in principle and possibility in practice though. Yes, it's possible to compensate for intermittent supply by creating a massive capacity far in excess of your actual energy requirements. If wind supplies, say, 30% of energy demand and on a relatively still day it only produces 10% of energy demand then you need solar/tidal/biomass capacity of 20% of energy demand to meet the gap... in addition to the contribution those sources make to the energy mix normally. And the same is true for solar and overcast days - you'd need extra wind capacity to supply the lack of sun.

God help you if you have an overcast day with no wind.

So yes, if you have a load of redundant capacity then of course intermittent supply from any one source is not a problem. But the cost of such capacity undermines any cost-based argument you may have for renewables.

Compare this to a situation where you build a single power station that will supply 5% of energy demand and can be expected to supply that amount constantly. 

Yes, traditional power stations occasionally go offline... but to equate the occasional malfunction of a traditional power plant with the intermittency of renewables - not a malfunction, but part of their daily function - stretches belief.",0,1413042850,null,0,false,0,cl6krur,t3_2ixrcl,t1_cl6krur,t1_cl6kit4,null,1426578901,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

All of the problems you mention have been resolved by engineers decades ago; divine intervention is not required.

They are discussed in the sources I gave above.

&gt;it's not just that the errors were ""numerous and glaring"". Like the article says, it's that they're integral to the plot.

# 2. As you mentioned:

&gt;I think perhaps they could have hand-waved a lot of the problems in this story by saying that the egg exists on several additional dimensions...

Because, although I'm a huge science nitpicker/snob, I'm also a huge Doctor Who apologist. Most of the ridiculous scientific problems that were in the episode could be handwaved away by, as you said, having the creature or egg exist across multiple dimensions! 

This could also solve the problem of the ""single-celled prokaryotic organisms"" being giant spiders with teeth and web spinners and whatnot (impossible). As long as you say the words 'another dimension' to me, I'd be COMPLETELY content with all the nonsense. But what really irks me is that, although they could've fixed everything with just those two words, they didn't. A quick throwaway line was all you needed and you couldn't even be arsed? C'mon.


Now the Space Shuttle being able to land on the Moon? That's nonsense that can't be fixed by multiple dimensions.

The most recent nuclear power station built in the UK was based on a Westinghouse design, effectively underlining the years of failed designs from the UK nuclear industry.

Additionally, the industry made all kinds of fanciful promises in its early days about how electricity will be ""too cheap to meter"", while it went about keeping all kinds of liabilities and costs out of the record books, to the extent that these were only noticed when the UK energy industry was due to be privatised in the 90s. When the private corporations that were in the running to buy up British power stations looked at the finances behind the nuclear industry, they realised that anyone buying them would be inheriting an epic clusterfuck, so none of them wanted to touch any of it. In 1996, 8 power stations, the only part likely to be profitable, were privatised as British Energy for £2.1 billion, which was a relative pittance. The rest of the industry, burdened with (literally) toxic liabilities: decomissioning costs, fuel reprocessing costs, waste storage costs, etc remained in public ownership as British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.

UKIP wants to ""protect the NHS"" but at the same time institute wide reaching tax cuts that will cause a bigger shortfall in government spending. That's not even mentioning their proposal to increase military spending. (Why?)

They want to reintroduce grammar schools, an inherently bad concept which caused a major gap between education quality which was rightfully abolished decades ago.

They seem to believe that by leaving the EU we'll retain the rights to the free trade area which has become a cornerstone of the British economy, we were lucky to keep the pound. But at the same time they want to LEAVE those agreements to stop immigration.

They want to abolish inheritance tax, a big addition to the budget that brings in 3BN a year and only effects people that are quite well off. This will cause an even bigger wealth gap as huge sums of cash are passed down untaxed.

They want to guarantee armed forces veterans places in the police force, which violates the basic principle that they should be as independent from each other as possible to make them more approachable to the public.

Firstly, with physics maths and software development you will have no problem getting training and a job. What I suggest you do is start contacting schools to get some experience. Keep calling as it is generally a nightmare to get hold of the right person. Generally you need 3 weeks worth to get on a pgce, which is one route. I would suggest you try and get experience in two schools- one that is amazing and one that you feel like you need a stab vest for. A ""normal"" school will be a mix of both. If you come out of the shitty school still feeling like you want to teach, you'll probably be able to put up with the bull shit that makes up about 60-70% of teaching. Teaching is definitely something you need to want to do- it doesn't make a good fallback. About 70% of teachers leave in the first few years, which says a lot! Teaching is a mix of highs and lows and for me personally, the highs aren't worth the lows- what you need to decide is if they are for you. That's where experience comes in!

&gt;The __bootstrap paradox__, or __ontological paradox__, is a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) that refers to scenarios whereby items or information are passed from the future to the past, which in turn become the same items or information that are subsequently passed from the future to the past - this creates a circularity of cause-effect such that the items or information have no discernible origin. Thus, the paradox raises the ontological questions of where, when and by whom the items were created or the information derived.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"&gt; The thing is Doctor Who is a show that incorporates time travel, but it does not have to be a show about time travel.

Some people actually want time travel to play more of a role and some people want it less. I don't know the percentages but it doesn't seem like one side vastly outnumbers the other.

&gt; The problem is those events and the ones that contradict them , are not 20 year apart or even 10 years apart, they are a few episodes ( weeks,months) apart.

I will concede this point but also add that so far I don't think any contradictions have been egregious enough for me yet. But I will agree that I am not the norm because I have heard a good deal of the audios and read prose/comics so many situations that have happened in the show have similar situations that happened in the extended universe so some things may not seem as contradictory to me or I may have alternate explanations for situations ready to go.

&gt; No, it would actually lower them.But that is the point , people are more deeply affected by one little boy they came to know dying than they are by nameless millions.

I have seen that people feel that having a character they know well possibly die generally raises the stakes because they expect them to have plot immunity. Having Katarina and Sara die in The Dalek's Master Plan raised the stakes pretty high as did Adric's death at the hands of the Cybermen in Earthshock. And then there is a spoiler event in one of the Eighth Doctor audios that raise the stakes pretty darn high. And most people I have seen criticize the high stakes just want the Doctor to not face world-ending/universe-ending situations every week.

And it seems like our opinions on the Daleks and Cybermen just differ plain and simple. 

* I find the Daleks are shown to be more than one-dimensional in many of their episodes. Yeah some are rote and they become one-dimensional but there are plenty that go beyond them as just killing machines. They are shown to be quite deceptive and persuasive at times. They are also often willing to keep people alive to achieve their goals. The fact that some Daleks follow Davros and some follow the Emperor shows that they are not single-minded.

* I will agree that they have been less successful for me in making the Cybermen as dynamic in Classic, but I still find there to be plenty of dimensions sprinkled throughout. And I think the introduction of a different type of Cybermen in New Who expanded their characterization and I look forward to their being future episodes that deal with Mondas vs Cybus. 

&gt; The problem is that it is not presented as this is just the Doctor's point of view as being somewhat delusional and obsessed with a being a good man. In the Racnoss example, you gave Donna is the one that says he needs to be stopped whereas the Doctor seems cool with it.And that just makes Waters Of Mars , we should be horrified by what the Doctor did, not that he kind of sounds like a villain we know in his speech pattern.

The point of The Waters of Mars wasn't to show that the Doctor saving Adelaide was wrong nor was it showing that not saving them was wrong. Even Adelaide alludes to this saying that Time Lord Victorious is wrong, not that the Doctor himself was wrong. The point was how the Doctor responded to the situation and how he felt about the decision he made and what he did after he made this decision to save them. I was just using an example of the Doctor sounding like the Master. There is more too it than that. 

* He didn't have to take them all home. He could have taken them anywhere else in time and the universe to live out their lives. Everyone back at home would have still thought that they died and the flow of time would have remained in tact. But the Doctor didn't save them to save someone/anyone like in The Fires of Pompeii, he was trying to prove himself powerful and clever. Yes he could and would alter the laws of time because they were his to control.

* The Doctor calling himself victorious because he committed double genocide is pretty frightening considering he generally finds killing even a single person or a handful of people distasteful (except in certain instances).

* Had the Doctor had the presence of mind to sit Adelaide down and explain to her why he felt he had to save her she might not have responded as she had. Instead he belittled her intelligence and the importance of her and her crew.

My main frustration is the lack of communication from BT to me. I've had a problem for over a month now.

Everytime they claim to have fixed the problem it pops up again less than 24 hours later. The end result is that I'm left sitting here with a poor service that I'm basically powerless to do anything about. Writing them a letter of complaint won't improve my service if numerous calls over the course of a month didn't.

I have heard a lot of good things about Virgin which is why I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here. Everybody makes mistakes which is fair enough however I'm hoping they'll act quickly to rectify it. My main worry is that they're going to tell me to wait another 2-3 weeks before they can send out another engineer which would give a total wait time of 5-6 weeks for them to install their service, which in my eyes is pretty unacceptable to be honest considering it's less than a days work.

For all his frustration once he was over 30, the fact remains that only 13 players have scored more Premier League goals than Jermain Defoe. When you look at the names of those above him, it's pretty impressive.

I like the look of Berahino mostly because of what he does without the ball. We lack someone who presses constantly and makes runs constantly. I would take him for 15m in a heartbeat.

Employers are having to pay higher wages and employees still feel poorer as all the extra money just goes straight to landlords - essentially it means that more and more of the wealth generated by productive endeavours just goes to the idle property owners.

We are once again witnessing the rise of a new 'landed gentry' which is damaging business and industry via the leeching of the fruits of productive labour.

Ultimately the house prices will crash eventually when the economy simply cannot support higher prices as housing is already taking all of the surplus value. I just hope the politicians are willing to risk votes to save the economy before that point - sadly it seems most are willing to damage the nation so long as they get re-elected.

false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"I am an Electrical Power Engineer and I tell you now that, professionally, you're wrong. I'll explain why:

In the UK we're currently facing a major issue with our generation portfolio, in that over the next 10 years a whole lot of it is closing down. By ""a whole lot"" I mean a quarter: 1 in 4 power stations will shut. This has the very real potential to cause a system-wide blackout, because the supply of electricity must be kept equal to the demand every minute of every day. You can't easily store electricity, you need to produce it on demand in real time.

We need electricity, and we need it 24 hours a day 7 days a week, as a result of this reality.

Wind farms don't spin 24 hours a day. Do you know how much wind energy contributes to the UK right this instant? 2%. Download the ""UK Energy Watch"" app, it gives you it minute by minute.

Nuclear? 15%. That's with 2 nuclear plants offline and 2 at half capacity due to various boiler issues.

What's making up the rest? 45% gas, 28% coal, 9% interconnectors, and the rest is hydro of some sort.

When the wind doesn't blow, we get nothing. We're generating 88% of our electricity right now through fossil fuel, and the 9% from interconnectors (France and Netherlands) is probably fossil too.

Whether you like it or not we **need** something that can sit and belch out gigwatts of power every minute of every day, otherwise the power goes off.

Shut that 15% nuclear we have right now and build more wind turbines: you've traded 15% of our supply for maybe 1% more, because the wind isn't blowing right now.

Considering we're on 97% fossil fuel right now, what kind of fossil fuel do you want? Coal? Gas? Nuclear?

I pick Nuclear.

By the way, average capacity factor for wind in the UK is nowhere near 40%, don't throw blatantly biased sites like cleantechnica at me, go read DUKES (Digest of UK Energy Statistics) Chapter 6: you'll see 40% is the absolute best you can expect, not national average. Onshore capacity factor can be as low as 22-25%. It was 30% this year.

I should point out I wholeheartedly support renewable energy and want to see more wind farms. Dropping something as dependable as nuclear and switching to wind energy is the policy of people who don't actually understand how an electricity network works. It'll never happen with current technology.

Therefore no, our new Nuclear power plant is not a mistake: it's a fantastic triumph for energy security. I hope the rest that are being planned for are approved and built very, very quickly.",0,1413050500,null,0,1413050927,0,cl6nxvi,t3_2ixrcl,t1_cl6nxvi,t3_2ixrcl,null,1426577412,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

You can access your credit report for free with www.noddle.co.uk and that's all you really need.

There is no ""student"" classification on credit records, all that will be noted is that you have a £1,500 overdraft facility and you are often close to it.

It generally makes common sense to keep the student account for as long as possible, due to the interest free overdraft facility (interest free credit is always better than interest-bearing credit).

That said, you are currently living off *not your money*. You should work to repay the overdraft. [We have a section in the FAQ about budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/budgeting).

Lenders don't tend to like lending to people who never see a positive balance in their current accounts. 

Even though it's tempting to have savings and your overdraft, you would probably be better repaying the overdraft before having separate savings.

It's intensely frustrating trying to get anything put on here as it is, as most local artists will agree, unless they're one of the gilded few who have a direct line to the few moneypots available. Most of those gilded few are crap anyway, so their loss won't be missed. Abbie Spallen, one of the individual artist recipients from the Arts Council this year, made a great point when she talked about nepotism in the arts here, and the lack of opportunity for artists here ([last paragraph.](http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1488))

People need to engage with the arts, and the arts have a duty to be relevant to their audience, as much as they can without dumbing things down entirely. That hasn't been forthcoming from any of the major arts institutions in recent years and this is the end result of that. Ulster Orchestra included.

I'm cautiously optimistic that this is the kind of deathblow that will spark a mini-renaissance, if the artists are up for it. We can't expect special treatment, not when normal people are without jobs or opportunities. Artists have to earn their money just like everyone else, and it bears repeating - we don't deserve special treatment, and definitely not when we're not even creating very much of value here in the North as it is.

It's easy to condemn the cuts, which in the context of subsidized bonfires and exorbitant policing costs for marches do seem deeply fucked up, and they are deeply fucked up and it's a shame - but something has needed to be done about the arts in this country for a long time.

Citizen's Advice (which is a Solicitor from somewhere in Bradford - on rota) can advise as to the exact law but they will almost certainly also suggest sending a letter to the neighbour to try and nip it in the bud early and subsequently have follow-up appointments. The letter and initial advice will be free. Follow-ups won't be.

Litigation is very expensive, and very lengthy: think at least three years. Very few cases end in legal fees being awarded to the winner, so even if you get a ruling to restore boundaries, it might cost you several thousand pounds to get it.

Real could do without facing a decent side in the group stage and they will be expected to win, it's tricky for them. Liverpool will be looking to cause an upset and prove the point that we can live with the best teams in the Champions League. So most of our players will be extremely motivated here. It could even be a tonic and begin a good run of form for us.

Real's defence has had a tricky time of late, they are also sorely missing Alonso and Di Maria in the engine-room. I expect us to bring our best. Granted our best includes Skrtel flinging himself around, misplaced passes and Balotelli doing the unpredictable, but yes that's our best at the moment. I think we have enough in Studge, Sterling, Balo, Hendo, Lallana and Gerrard to cause any team in Europe problems.

- The autonomy. I may not be self-employed, and I don't get to choose exactly *what* I work on, but I do get to choose *how* I work on it. As a technical person, these are the decisions that I'm interested in making - not business development decisions for my design agency.

- The focus. This might be a turn-off for you. I do front-end day in, day out. That's all I really think about. I thrive on that kind of focus, and doing R&amp;D within a single field. You might prefer more variety in your life, though.

- The cushiness. Really, being a developer is a totally cushy career. Employers fall over themselves to provide 'cool' working environments, and in a lot of companies engineers hold much more power than front line staff in other domains. Except in finance, of course. Fuck finance.

**What I don't like**

- The isolation. I don't really speak to customers in my role or any users who might be affected in some way by the software I write. That's not to say I never get a 'thank you', but naturally I'm not going to see the consequences of my work directly. This might be different if I worked at a smaller company, though.

- Less flexibility. You might get the odd day working from home now and then, but basically you're going to be in the office, nine to five, every day. It's a different lifestyle to contracting.",0,1413057567,null,0,false,0,cl6qxex,t3_2ixk1r,t1_cl6qxex,t3_2ixk1r,null,1426576018,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Before we got about 300 kb/s but suddenly it was cutting out several times a day and speeds were halved. On one call we were told that our line had cut out over 100 times a day! Yet for some reason they were determined to try and not help us.

After endless weeks / months of phoning BT and speaking to some utterly incompetent people they finally sent out an engineer to check out the house. After 2 hours he couldn't figure it out and upgraded our homehub before leaving us with a still shitty internet. 

Phoned up again, 1 month later we got another engineer who told us he'd been working at BT for around 25 years but only just started on being a broadband engineer 3 weeks ago. He found the fault within 30 minutes, replaced and fixed it, our speed is now 450kb/s roughly and extremely stable. Most helpful BT employee I've ever spoken to, he even went and looked to see how far BT Infinity was from reaching us! (The plans BT had drawn up had us connected to Infinity by the beginning of summer but obviously that hasn't happened.)

The worst bit though was him saying there was another newer cabinet just 200m or so down the road that would give us much faster speed. BT won't connect us though, apparently they're too strapped for cash to connect our road to a faster line. Instead we have to stay on a cabinet fucking ages away with a shit speed.

Before this year I had nothing but good experience with BT but they've driven us up the wall with their incompetent customer support and general unhelpfulness. Why we had to pester them for months before they realised 'hurrdurr there's a problem in the line' is beyond me.
