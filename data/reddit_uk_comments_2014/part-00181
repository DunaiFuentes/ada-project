What the fuck else do you want to get from it? He scored goals. He's 21 it isn't like we were going to loan him to City or Liverpool. You want him to go on loan to a big name team next year so you'll shut up? He's in the top league in England and did well against all teams (including United with Ferguson).

There's nothing that guarantees that someone will be good enough. Look at Costa. He's had two shocking games in the WC. He also scored 30+ goals for Athletico Madrid. It isn't guaranteed that he will play well for us if we sign him.

He's assisted ALL of Sterling's goals last season. He's tied the all time goal scoring record of Ronaldo and Shearer in a single season whilst playing fewer games. He ended second on the assists table. There are no players out there of his caliber willing to move from their current teams, in his current position, that can play as well as he can... currently.

edit: inb4 people complaining about Moyes - the only reason United won the league in 2013 was RVP.

true,EvenArrantzier,null,null,"&gt;Spurs were shit without Bale.

I've copied and pasted this from an older comment because people don't seem to understand...

For the hundredth time...

Spurs didn't fail because of selling Bale. In fact their total points were practically identical. I think they had three less than they had with Bale, and in the first half of the season they actually had a point *more.*

They ""failed"" because 

- They played a high line with two slow defenders.
- Soldado was incapable of playing up front alone.
- The players they bought in were mostly average.
- AVB isn't a very good manager.
- Constantly changed the first 11.

Selling Bale barely had any impact at all in regards to their league standing.

Why don't people understand this? It's one of the biggest misconceptions of last year.

With Bale: 72

Without Bale: 69

Come on...

In fact I'd say their last season was more impressive considering the huge overhaul and managerial musical chairs that took place. 

So, you see, selling Bale actually had very little impact.",0,1403743834,null,0,false,0,cih6n3o,t3_293qf7,t1_cih6n3o,t1_cih6ihc,null,1434405571,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

I started trying to get support. when my past caught up with me. As a child myself and my sibling were severely abused. Our mum ended up killing herself, and then my dad went on to get his jollys from my 6 year old sister. some bad shit im sure you will agree.

I tried to get some therapy in late 2008. after going through 3 GP surgeries, (people often say if your not getting anywhere try a different GP).

finally at the beginning of 2010 I was assessed in surgery 4 appointments of around 3 hours each.

in may 2010 I was seen by a consult at the community MH team. This guy was completely up his own ass. after being told how lucky i was he pretty much left everything up in the air. I did ask for some to de-stress me and help get my insomnia. He refused point blank.

I then had a couple of short visits with nurses to talk about “treatment paths” (lol total f'ing joke). I had stated from the outset because it came up at initial assessment. That I was uncomfortable doing group type therapy because I needed to work through some of my abuse which I had never discussed with anyone at all and it is a big thing for me.

I was supossedly offered either group or one to one, I opted for the later. How ever this was roundly ignored and they kept on pushing the group. Eventually they did refer me to psychotherapy.

On receiving the referal I contacted the people I was referred to in order to discuss time frames for treatment. My contacts to the consultant at the psychotherapy dept were never answered although I was assured me messages had been passed on.

In July 2010 on the weekend of my birthday I received a discharge notice from the  psychotherapy dept. No response to my enquiries, no assessment, nothing. I basically lost my shit and made a suicide attempt.

At this point I approached some charities for advice. The overall view was tell the community MH team. Surely once they are aware of how serious your state is they will have to act. So I wrote to them and explained what had happened.

They wrote back making no mention of the attempt and instead made false assertions that they had offered to prescribe some experimental medication that was normally used for epilepsy?. Complete bull shit this simply did not happened.

Shortly after I received a discharge from them. This had a fabricated HONOS (mental well being score) and a statement saying that I had made threats to my self and others and if I should act on this it should be treated as a criminal matter!!!. This was late 2010. after this I made a complaint to PALS ( patient advice and liaison). After a few months of the dog aite my home work they eventually wrote back saying they had a little chat with the CMHT, their opinion differed. Case closed.

Went back to GP to get re-referred. This took a year.

In 2011 I had a meeting with the therapy dept. the woman I saw told me I would not be getting any therapy. By october 2011 I was in bad shape. I went to my GP and she referred me to the crisis team. They made their call to me explained the had been a reorganisation of the service and assurred me they would sort this out and promised to call back. I did not get contacted again, other than to receive another discharge notice.

During 2012 I became very withdrawn and the complex ptsd I am actually suffering from was really getting bad I stopped going out mostly because I was experiencing panic attacks. I did to some degree try to maintain mormality. But it was tough.

I eventually out of desperation contacted an estranged relative. My mums sister. She had inherited the lot from my grand parents and was living a very comfortable existence. Like a lot of rich people she has a complete empathy bypass. In short after promising to help pay for some treatment she bailed. I did get a small holiday out of it.

In jan 2013 I was getting ready to top myself. Someone got wind of this and called the cops. I was sectioned on a section 136 for assessment. It happened to start snowing that day and I was discharged. I think the staff were more concerned about about getting home. I had another meeting with the same consult I had seen before and explained that the false hope the lies and misrepresentation was not helping and I really needed. Some treatment.

The outcome of this meeting was a 2 page letter put in my file characterising me as being very difficult and critical of the service. I was discharged.

In mid 2013 the was a series on TV called bedlam which happened to be about the hospital I was trying to get help from. I got really pissed off at this white wash of a show/PR exercise. And took to twitter to slag them off. Perhaps in hind sight not a great idea. But at this stage I was desperate and my life was in tatters.

Sometime after this I received a call from the community mental health team asking if I still needed as they had been made aware of the tweets. I got quite upset the main reason they were calling was about the consult not about supporting me. At this point my physical heath was deteriorating and I had just had my gallbladder removed. I explained I was finding the call upsetting. My operation site was hurting and I would need to end the conversation. I also said I was was in need of help and I did want treatment. The next communication I received was, you guessed it. Another discharge notice. This notice said that I had got shouty on the phone so they discharged me (nov2013).

December 2013. my shakes which I put down to going in to shock. Started getting unbearably bad. On ths occasion it would not stop so after about 6 hours of shaking like a leaf I called an ambulance. In A&amp;E I explained the saga and the doctor offered to put me on a triage ward for a fresh start and a clean slate in order to get me the right help.

Once on the ward they tried to move me to another facility literally in the middle of the night. Although they promised to do all sorts of things like re enablement team, social worker  etc. none of this happened. They did prescribe some valium. 

I was discharged rather uncerimoniouly from the ward with the wrong medication and they refused to help me get transport home.

It then took 4 days of being bounced back and forth to get the right meds Ward: not our problem you’ve been discharged. GP: the ward fucked up and need to correct their error. Sigh.

My statutory 7 day review was with exactly the same consultant who had failed over 4 years to get me the right or any support. I was assigned a cpn. This was 23rd of dec 2013. The Community nurse told me she would contact me the next day to see if I was ok and to discuss plans. She did not call back and I did not hear form the Nurse again until  early January 2014.

I had a couple of appointments in jan/feb again I was told about getting other support re enablement team social worker welfare support etc. other than a meeting with a welfare/benefits advisor none of the other stuff was sorted.

Around this time my father was arrested as my sister had decided to report his abuse. I shared this with the nurse and explained I was concerned about the consult pulling my meds. As this was incredibly stressful and was bringing up all sorts of old issues for me. The consult pulled my meds the very next week.

After about 4 days I started getting the shake again and contacted the MH team. I was told ot take some responsibility for my self. Later that day I ended up being taken agian to hospital after talking to GP who decided to call the ambulance. After waiting 7 hours in A&amp;E a young doctor came and I could hear them discussing my case. This was around 1am. After giving me a speech verbatim of what the MH team person had told me earlier I was discharged without replacement medication. Just fuck off basically.

In march this year I had another meeting with the community nurse and told her I was really becoming averse to going to see them because it was leading nowhere and was simply demoralising me. She siad she would do me a favour and leave it as long as possible before calling me back in response to this???.

I have not heard form her since. I have resorted to salf medicating with Weed which really helps the ptsd symtoms but is meaning im going without food to afford it. At this point im really just living in the moment as thinking about this jst about makes my head want to explode.

Not all community mental heath teams are this shit. My sister is getting well supported.

Im pretty sure My consult has been peppering my file with disparaging rubbish because he dose not want to face going to corners court and tell a coroner oh we thought he was crying wolf. Some thing he has done in the past and is a mind boggling statement to hear from a supposed MH professional. My medical file is so full of false promises and false characterisations that if I were to give up. Any coroner would look at me notes and it would be case closed.

MY community MH service has been trough 3 re organisations in the last 12 years and still is a complete cluster fuck, with a completely toxic and damaging cultiure of blame the patient. More accountability is needed if a general doctor had fucked around a patient in such a way for so long I doubt they would get away with it but the maudsley just keep sweeping the shit under the carpet. The teaching hospital where this lady has just left post is in the grounds of the hospital I have been trying to get help from.I have been experiencing my own 5 year pus car crash. The amount of wasted GP appointments ambulances police call outs the impact on my family. The unseen monetary and social costs of situations like this are a pointless and unnecessary drain on other resources and in my case has left me with severely worse symptoms. I have lost all hope of getting this sorted and I need extensive therapy to get over trying to get therapy. Now that is mental. Fuck them, fuck them all.

tldr; been fucked around by MH services for years 5+ no treatment but plenty of blame the patient.

Took your laptops, aye?

Services such as Gmail keep a record of recent activity by IP address (a little number that identifies you on the internet). In Gmail for example, this is in the bottom-right of the mail settings page (""Details"").

If you were still logged into something, and they manage to fire the laptop up onto a network with you logged in, there is a chance that the activity will be recorded. Check your favorite online services for account history activity.

Microsoft has a similar service, which may record your xbox; http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/Account/Security/recentactivity.aspx.

When you have this IP and time, you can contact police. If they're significantly interested (they probably won't be), then they can reverse the IP to the internet account holder.

Of course, you will have to balance the need to track people with the need to secure your online services. With access to your laptop, they likely have a cache of recent passwords they could discover, so you will need to change them asap.

Here's my advice (what I have planned on doing).

Buy a light membership - and soon. It's affordable and the cheapest way to get access to tickets once they go on sale. You'll need to log on well before sales open and pray you have fast internet. Tickets generally sell in two blocks for each half of the season. Check and see if the game falls on a Champion's League weekend (either directly before or after a Champion's League match) just in case the date of the game is changed and you need a safety buffer of 1-2 days in order to attend.

If you have any other questions please feel free to ask!

Here are some direct quotes from him after he went out on loan to Everton early on in this past season.

&gt; ‘I was sitting in my hotel room in Brussels when the phone went to tell me I was going out on loan again,’ he said, ahead of Belgium’s World Cup qualifier with Scotland. ‘It was 7 pm, and that was the first I knew of it. There had not been a mention of it before then, but after speaking to my parents, I decided to take the plunge.
‘I talked to the manager as well, and while what he said was confidential, it just underlined that he is the best coach I have worked with. Some beat about the bush, but he comes out straight and tells you what he thinks. As a player, that is what you want.
‘The important thing, at 20, is to be playing, and while West Brom was an option, Everton was a better one. There are a few things I need to improve in my game, and Everton’s footballing approach and possession play can be perfect for me.
‘My movement and runs to the far post and near post could be better, and I have already had a good, long conversation with the manager Roberto Martinez about that. I’ve also known Kevin Mirallas since I was 14, and that should help. We talked about it (the loan move) all last night.’
‘Samuel Eto’o signing for Chelsea didn’t influence my decision, because I was already behind Fernando Torres in the pecking order anyway,’

true,DankJack,null,null,"Interestingly heroin only became prolific because of prohibition. I recommend you read Flat Earth News by Nick Davies. It's a fantastic book with an enlightening chapter about Heroin in the UK.


A lot of the major problems associated with heroin are actually consequences of its illegality. Consider this, if it was legal it would all be heavily regulated and medical grade. Medical grade heroin really isn't that bad for you. It only has two negative side affects, withdrawal and constipation. If the quality is consistent it becomes really difficult to overdose. You actually have to make a concerted effort to kill yourself, it's not something you can do accidentally. It also won't be cut with god knows what else. So in regards to the personal health of the user, heroin is a lot less dangerous than you think it is (when legal). I would argue it is actually safer than cigarettes or alchohol (If legal and prescribed by doctors).


Then consider if it were legal it would be much much cheaper. Heroin isn't very expensive to manufacture but the illegality increases the price. This high price combined with the desire to not enter withdrawal means users will do a lot to fund their habit. Prostitution, theft, etc. If it were legal a heroin habit wouldn't be more expensive than a cigarette habit. Suddenly you elimate all the secondary crime associated with use.


Now imagine if all heroin users could get a prescription from their GP. The addicts are now under medical supervision and are taught how to use the drug safely. Legalisation is much less harmful to addicts and society than prohibition.


I would also like to see more research into Ibogaine and possibly a government run treatment center offering Ibogaine therapy. We could realistically eliminate heroin addiction in a decade if we made a coordinated effort in this direction. Unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation about heroin.

Here is my advice, and a future warning to all:  

when it comes to mental health do **not** rely on your GP.  

As much as I respect GPs, they are fucking shit at mental health. Useless beyond description.  

If you seek help, go *directly* to MH services. Don't go via GP. Just don't.  

I know some staff in MH can be fuck-ups, but there are good people out there who are brilliant at their job.  

But for the love of God, don't go through your GP for mental health.  

At first, my GP recommended me to The Priory (which is private btw) with recommended treatment. An actual psychiatrist saw the recommendation and basically said ""Fucking hell. If you actually took those meds you'd be a walking zombie.""

&gt;

&gt;The long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series ___[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)___ has developed a large __fan base__ over the years.

&gt;*Doctor Who* fans are sometimes referred to as __Whovians.__  The usage was more common among fans in the United States during the 1980s, when the *Doctor Who Fan Club of America* (pronounced by members as Dwifca – now defunct) published the *Whovian Times* as its newsletter.

&gt;An early use of 'Whovian', outside of the 'Whovian Times', is from [Flaming Carrot Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_Carrot_Comics) issue number 19 (circa 1988), when Flaming Carrot leads a combined group of [Trekkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie) and Whovians into rebellion.

I don't think he's scored a single goal that Lukaku wouldn't be capable of scoring.

You have to ask yourself how many more ""immediate benefits"" is Torres or even Ba going to bring to this squad? Ba has knee issues which will probably mean he doesn't age well and Torres has hit 30, which is the point of no return for fast players in any sport. He will only be declining from here on out. 

Honestly the way you phrase the choice of ""struggling"" with Lukaku suggests that we've had great strikers and using Lukaku would be a step down. The #1 talking point about this team in any forum is that the strikers are just terrible compared to our rivals'. I really don't know if we'd be ""struggling"" any more with Lukaku than with Torres and at least with Lukaku there is the very real possibility that he *will* develop, whereas it should be clear to anyone at this point that Torres isn't going to get any better. His best days are surely behind and it only holds this team back to try and make him work.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;I'm not in love with lukaku and have no special admiration for him. But I tell you what, I understand why he would be upset enough to say silly things when he performs so well for WBA and than Everton and we still think it's a better idea to throw Torres out every game and send him on loan.
To each his own brother. Just don't think he warrants as much hate as the vocal MINORITY here have been giving him.

Personally I feel that his performances are blown out of proportion. Its never as simple as ""he's scored more goals than Torres so deserves to be upset about not getting a chance"". A prime example that I give is Michael Owen under Fabio Capello for England. He was scoring consistently for Newcastle but Capello refused to select him because he wasn't part of the team; didn't work for the team and instead wanted the team to work for him. Modern day managers want modern day strikers. Drogba was first of his kind because he worked for the team. That's what made him a threat in every single match, even though players like Darren Bent, Marlon Harewood, Yakubu have scored more goals in a season than Drogba over the years. In fact, there's only been 2 seasons where Drogba has been top scorer in the league. Lukaku has a tendency of disappearing in games. He might eventually grow out of it, but at a club at Chelsea, new age fans and the owner expect results and you can't win against the best of teams with strikers who go missing. But on this sub I see too much fascination with Lukaku. Whether I'd take Torres over him is debatable, but I would definitely start Costa over Lukaku.",0,1403750700,null,0,false,0,cih9jtx,t3_28tbzq,t1_cih9jtx,t1_cig821o,null,1434406949,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,CanIGetAWhatThats,null,null,"Before Luis Suarez came to Liverpool, he was playing at AJAX in the Dutch Eredivision. The AJAX manager just told the others to pass the ball to Suarez, then he would do the rest. So basically Luis Suarez was a 'one man team' and 'everything' depended on Luis suarez. - But there's 11 footballers on a team, so how can anyone put all the pressure on just one on the team? - And what does that do to that 'one' and his mindset? (111 goals in 159 matches for AJAX). Luis Suarez bit an oponent, and had to leave AJAX. Coming to Liverpool was a fresh start for Luis Suarez. But once again, Liverpool were then described as 'a one man team', and everything (once again) depended on Luis Suarez. I remember Suarez in the beginning at Liverpool, - he constantly shot at goal, getting 1 goal from 10 shots. Then the Patrice Evra saga begins, and Luis Suarez is wrongfully banned for 'racial abusing' Manchester United's Patrice Evra. And he's given a 7 match ban, which most have forgotten. But another one is added, as Suarez (discretely) fingers the opponent crowd, as they abuse him, - on grounds of the Patrice Evra saga. (Fair..?) And the English media can't tell enough, about how much a racist Luis Suarez are, and all his antics...etc. In Suarez mind he's still the 'one' in Liverpool's 'one man team', very much thanks to the media, constantly highlighting that Liverpool would be 'nothing' without Suarez. And of couse Steven Gerrard, not being a 'top top player' doesn't help Liverpool much..! (Joking). Then Suarez bite Ivanovic, and gets banned for 10 matches. Everybody's talking about, who is now going to score Liverpool's goals, with the 'one man' out of the team? Liverpool's next match is away vs Newcastle, and without Suarez on the team, Liverpool gets the club's highest ever away win in the EPL, when dismantling Newcastle 0-6. Next season (after last summers constant 3 months long haul Suarez saga) Brendan Rodgers and Dr. Peters has taught Luis Suarez, that Liverpool is not a 'one man team', - despite what every media outlet is saying constantly. - And look at Luis Suarez last season as a happy team-player in Liverpool. And all the awards etc. Then the World Cup begins. The fact that Uruguay is even in Brazil, is all thanks to Luis Suarez. - Once again Luis Suarez is 'that one man' in a 'one man team'. Uruguay loses to Costa Rica, without Luis Suarez. Who wasn't fit so soon after knee surgery. Then before the England match, the entire English media, totally slates him, and Roy Hodgson claims Luis Suarez is not yet proven 'world class' etc. A 50% fit Luis Suarez singlehandedly beats England, - which can't have been easy for Suarez emotionally, playing against 5 of his mates from Liverpool....! The psychological pressure Luis Suarez is under, both before and under the match Uruguay vs Italy, where, not only a whole nation (Uruguay) - but the whole football world, once again, is stating it's all up to the performance of Luis Suarez, to decide whether Uruguay or Italy goes home from Brazil..And then Luis Suarez 'snaps again' - and bites an opponent... Of course I have no idea of how much the reader knows about psychology, - but to me, it's very obvious that there's only so much pressure you can put on one man, with the whole world watching...! Luis Suarez may play football 'from out of this world' and do things on a football pitch nobody's ever done before. But he is also a humanbeing. And the way he has been treated, both in AJAX. And later in the Premier League, both by the FA (Man Utd) and the English media...! I don't think it's fair to treat Luis Suarez this way, when you consider the weight being put on his shoulders, by so many. And then the constant disrespectful behavior, from the media, calling him a racist and still talking about his 'antics' which is (were) in the past. But the fact that England and Uruguay ended up in the same group at the World Cup, was just bad luck. But it's not only the English media. It's also the entire nation of Uruguay, the whole football organisation in Uruguay, who need to learn from what Liverpool did, to HELP Luis Suarez become the world class footballer he is, without the constant pressure, to lift the entire team.

I've worked with 3 pregnant women in my 6 months with the company, all on light duties, some in late stages (8 months).

Management will work unpaid overtime to hit productivity targets because that is worth more to their salary than doing otherwise. Anyone else doing so does it off their own back.

Sick days do not count towards productivity. The company has a generous sick pay scheme (considerably higher than the legal minimum), but if someone is not going to fulfill their end of the contract, they will go to the Bradford Index.

The only case I can think of that requires a ""2-man"" (so sexist) lift is cooking oil. Can you guess what s.o.p. is with that? Two people lift it.

Standard travel expectation is 30 minutes. In exceptional circumstances, staff may be asked to travel further. I also can't think of an area that takes two hours to travel across. The furthest I can think of is 40 minutes from the furthest two stores at rush hour. Bearing in mind that shifts usually finish at 11am/6pm/9pm you never hit rush hour.

 Utter nonsense.

There is a big difference between wanting to start games and wanting to be the main striker. For example, Eto'o and Torres, this past season. Both started a lot of games but neither was our main striker.

I think Lukaku would be fine with getting the same amount of minutes as either of them, but he didn't want to end up in Ba's situation were the other 2 get to start games but he sits on the bench most of the time.

Manchester United and PSG both made it to the quarter finals, we made it to the semi finals. Not counting the performance bonus or the market share payout, we got an extra 4.9 million. There is no way a team could make it through the group stages and make more than a team who progressed further than they did, if you only account for the performance bonus.

The big thing that screwed us over is the market share payment. Countries with big soccer watching populations, but only a few teams in the tournament get a lot of money. Look at Juventes, didn't make it out of the group stage and only made 300k less than us. Actually, if you factor in their Europa League money, they made more than us (they would be 2nd in total money, behind Real and about 80k above Atletico).

The preformance bonus makes sense to me. You pay the teams a little extra to compete harder, but they can't make more than someone who goes further than them.

The market share payment is messed up and doesn't make sense to me. How does a team that only plays 6 games (Juve) get 13 million more than a team who played 12(us)?",0,1403754148,null,0,false,0,cihaygf,t3_292p4s,t1_cihaygf,t1_ciha221,null,1434407634,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,DrTenochtitlan,null,null,"This is correct. There are 156 individual stories from the classic era of Doctor Who, spanning the first eight Doctors. (I'm including the 1996 FOX TV movie with the Eighth Doctor in this total.) However, in all but one case, these stories were made up of several episodes. Most stories were made up of four or six parts, but could range from two to as many as fourteen episodes which featured cliffhangers each week. I believe the number of individual episodes of the classic series is around 697 (again, including the TV Movie as a single episode/story).

Now, out of the classic episodes, there are currently 97 missing from the archives. In the 1960s and 1970s, video tape and film storage space was incredibly expensive, and reruns really weren't possible at the time in the UK due to rights issues. So, many episodes were simply junked. Fortunately, beginning in the 1980s, a search began to try and recover some of these missing episodes. Some were (thankfully) taken by collectors instead of being junked. Others were copies found in the overseas archives of former British colonies, which watched the same programs but often didn't junk episodes that they were supposed to. As a result, a good number of episodes (though far short of all) have been recovered. However, there are still sadly 10 complete stories that no longer exist, and an additional 16 stories that partially exist, but have one or more individual episodes missing. All of them are from the era of the First and Second Doctors.

Now, what Netflix has done is simply take a sampling of classic stories from each of the old Doctors and posted them as representative of what each era was like. None of the episodes on Netflix are missing episodes of course, since they're still missing! lol ",0,1403755893,null,0,1403756264,0,cihbmc1,t3_2946o6,t1_cihbmc1,t1_cih99et,null,1434407903,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

* best midfield with targets:

------------------Striker------------------

----Hazard--------------------Oscar-------

------------Kroos-----Fabregas------------

-----------------Matic-------------------

* best midfield with only current players:

------------------Striker------------------

----Hazard--------------------Schurrle-------

------------Oscar-----Fabregas------------

-----------------Matic-------------------

As far as player go I think Schurrle will be the one to have a breakout season. We got a glimpse of that this season when he got to start and hopefully we will see more next season. IIRC he had the best starts - goals ratio of our midfielders.

And someone who I don't think will have a breakout season but will surprise people with his quality is Van Ginkel. With our current personnel I have trouble seeing him get enough game time to truly have a ""breakout"" season.

As far as how players fare in the pecking order this is what I think.

**Left wing:** Hazard, Schurrle, Willian, Salah

**Right wing:** Schurrle, Willian, Salah, Oscar

**Central attacking midfielder (4-2-3-1):** Oscar, Willian, Fabregas, Hazard (will probably be playing at LW, but can play here as well), *Kroos*

**The 2 central midfielders in a 4-3-3:** Fabregas, *Kroos*, Oscar, Willian, Ramires, *Tiago*, Van Ginkel

**Holding player in 4-3-3**

* Matic
* *Tiago*
* Mikel?

You could probably throw in a couple youngsters as well who would stay with the first team. Like Chalobah or Ake.

&gt;

&gt;A __Fluffernutter__ is a [sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich) made with [peanut butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter) and [marshmallow creme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow_creme) usually served on [white bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_bread). Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of [wheat bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain) and the addition of various sweet, salty and [savory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami) ingredients. The term *fluffernutter* can also be used to describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow creme.

&gt;The sandwich was first created in the early twentieth century after [marshmallow creme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow_creme), a sweet [marshmallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow)-like [spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_(food\)), was invented in [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts). During World War I, a recipe for a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, the earliest known example of the sandwich, was published. The term *Fluffernutter* was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market the sandwich.

&gt;The sandwich is particularly popular in [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) and has been proposed as the official state sandwich of Massachusetts. However, it has also sparked controversy because of its nutrition content and its possible contribution to [childhood obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity).

Cambridge has a lot of history, but still retains a small-city sense of organisation, cleanliness and general optimism. Probably because of the enormous student population, large green areas and relatively wealthy inhabitants.

Edinburgh is geographically interesting, with hills and crags and all sorts of features right outside the city great for scenery and walks. There are a lot of great historical aspects to it, and it's just generally a pretty city with a lot going on.

Took me from Calais up to Belgium then way back down round Paris to St Malo and back to Calais over a long weekend.

Gear wise I had nothing special that I wouldn't be taking with me on a long ride for the UK. I have a thermal base layer that is dead handy for when the sun goes down and eve on hot days it gets cold quickly.

Also make sure you have an accessible pocket or tank bag with your wallet in it. Having to root around in your panniers at tolls is not fun. So having your card handy to shove in the machine and then somewhere to put it with your ticket is handy.

Paperwork wise I am maybe a bit over cautious but I take:
EHIC card
Passport (obviously!)
V5 logbook
Insurance certificate
MOT certificate
Plastic and Paper parts of licence

That way your covered including any funny business at the border. Although to be honest last time I got the ferry to France the French border control in Dover just waved me through. No passport check no nothing, just straight through!

Hope this all helps, enjoy your trip :)

true,babybantick,eng-lestershire,Leicester lad in Derby,"Hey guys! I got an official letter of apology, here its is:
	
We are sorry

Dear Christopher

As you may have already read or heard in the press, following the Financial Conduct Authority announcement we have today issued a public apology. We have identified the customer group affected by a historical debt collection issue and certain system errors.

Following our internal investigations, we can confirm you have not been affected by either of these issues. You do not need to do anything but please read this email carefully.
	
	
Historical debt collection issues 

Between 2008 and 2010, we sent out letters to 44,556 customers claiming to be from companies “Barker &amp; Lowe” and “Chainey, D’Amato &amp; Shannon”. These letters were in fact from Wonga. They gave the misleading impression that customers’ outstanding debts had been passed on to a law firm (or other third party) with the threat of adverse consequences if the debts were not repaid quickly. Charges were added to some customer accounts as a result of this practice. 

This practice was unacceptable and should never have happened. It ran contrary to the principle of transparency on which our business has been built. 

System errors 

Following an internal investigation we have also identified certain system errors, which resulted in the miscalculation of some customers’ balances. Some customers overpaid Wonga whilst a greater number underpaid, with the majority of those customers who overpaid Wonga, overpaying by less than £5. 

All known balance calculation issues have been addressed. For existing customers, where they have overpaid Wonga this will be repaid with interest and those who underpaid Wonga will not be asked to pay the shortfall. 

Our apology 

We apologise unreservedly to all of our customers. Although you have not been directly affected by these issues, we are working hard to do the right thing and earn back your trust. 

Our priority now is to work with the Financial Conduct Authority, our regulator, to agree a redress programme which will ensure affected customers are appropriately compensated. 

For further information, visit wonga.com/apology or call us directly on our freephone number, 0800 840 0836 or national call rate number, 0333 005 0836 to speak to our customer service team. 

Yours,

There's a few things, in hindsight, that would have made us less preferred targets. Programmable timers for lights are a cheap and effective way to make the place look occupied when no-one is home, which is a really good deterrent. Keep keys inside cupboards, rather than out where they can be picked up (there is some ingenuity to an effective burglary), even at a distance. Motion detection alarm systems and visible CCTV are a more serious investment, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. Ask victim support about any schemes they may have to help cover the costs, which I'm told they sometimes do for certain kinds of victim.

So yes, it is pretty much stating the obvious. If whats been reported is to be believed then we are close to both. Close to both means all our current budget gone, even with player sales we'll have maybe another 30-40 mil to spend IF everyone player rumored to be leaving goes. 


That leaves us very little room for movement over a LB, CB, CM and Origi. Throw in the new wage demands and we're easily going to be over budget unless we don't bother with other areas.

Simple, apparently obvious breakthroughs do happen in product development, but they are rare.

The process change sounds extremely promising; anything which reduces the use of hazardous chemicals in manufacturing is always worth celebrating, but the fact that they don’t have an appreciation of how much this could reduce the cost of solar cells by, suggests they don’t have an understanding of what proportion of the cost of cell manufacture this process represents. A cost reduction of 50% of a process stage worth 1% of the part value ultimately doesn’t impact manufacturing costs that much.

It could be that companies haven’t been looking at this stage because it’s considered reasonably cost-effective and controllable with existing processes, it’s not worth re-qualifying a design over, or because their focus is on more expensive processes. Equally it *might* be a remarkable way of reducing the cost of solar cells. There isn’t enough information in the article to tell.

true,LLJK_Kennedy,lfc99,,"It's simply enough - society has decided that biting someone evokes a disgust above and beyond other types of physical contact. We have whole sports dedicated to physical combat, but still outlaw biting in them. 

Suarez should be given the maximum penalty for international games because biting has absolutely no place in the the game. I mean, at this stage Suarez has missed nearly half a club season in cumulative bans for the same act; that's not really on, is it? 

An international ban would help both Suarez and Liverpool too,  he was much more in control last season and is loved in Liverpool - there's not nearly as much pressure on him there as there is when he plays for Uruguay, as Sterling, Sturridge, Henderson etc have all had purple patches to make the headlines while he was quietly banging them in. Liverpool are a team with a star player. Uruguay is a star player in a team.  Big difference when it comes to pressure and expectations.  Apart from Cavani, he has the whole expectation of a nation on his shoulders. 

So yeah, give him an international ban, let him feel the love in Merseyside for another year or two. I'd almost hazard a wager that if he does go for a world record to Barca or Madrid, this won't be the last controversial incident of Suarez's career.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"The thing that a lot of people seem to miss is that at least so far as the police are concerned the legality of a substance has little to do with any harm it may cause and much more to do with the fact that they can arrest people in possession of it. Take away the illegality and the police can no longer arrest them. The police don't want to lose that power, although to be fair sometimes it is used to get people who are obviously dodgy but they haven't been able to get on anything else a la Al Capone on tax evasion. More often though it's used against regular, otherwise law-abiding folk who after being arrested can be investigated more thoroughly to find out if the police can stick anything else to them. 

Because the police face arrest and prosecution targets this kind of abuse of the system is inevitable. Instead of preventing crime it is in police interest to maximise their arrest rates as it makes them look as if they are busy, doing a good job and need more resources. However it also turns the police's natural allies against them as in practice it means that motorists end up being targeted and treated more harshly by the justice system than burglars. This disproportionality is already at the point where middle aged, middle class types are no longer even bothering to report crimes to the police. Having direct entry to the police force at superintendent level is a step in the right direction but there needs to be a complete overhaul of policing culture, including legalisation and regulation of drugs if we are to prevent this malaise from getting worse.",0,1403774188,null,0,false,0,cihgcmk,t3_294vfa,t1_cihgcmk,t3_294vfa,null,1434410206,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

&gt;The early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country.[57] **Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England**,[58] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.[59] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.[60]

&gt;In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots, inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.[61][62]

&gt;In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.[63][64]

&gt;Although the monarchy was restored, it ensured (with the Glorious Revolution of 1688) that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system.[65] During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power (and the interest in voyages of discovery) led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America.[66][67]
Since the Acts of Union of 1707

The Treaty of Union led to a single united kingdom encompassing all Great Britain.

Really there are a lot of variables that come into play in modern unionist and traditional loyalist culture (I say traditional as the two terms were at a time interchangeable). History, security, community and tradition all play a part.


**music**

You have the Ulster-Scots influence, there a plenty of pipe bands about the country to attest to that, but also the drumming culture has some root here. 

Lambeg drums, which do have a point and are an instrument, stretch from a competition between drummers, trying to out do each other with the size of their drums, until large drums became the norm, these are a different type of drum and are played entirely differently from bass drums, played with long, thin, curved canes. The skins are made from goat skins, and takes an entire goat to make one side, the dark line down the centre is where the spine was. The skins are made using centuries old techniques, when my father got his first bodhran made he used some skin of an old head, the craftsman was in awe of the quality of the skin because the skills used in making skins for bodhrans were long forgotten, if they were present at all. While traditionally not a drum confined to unionists, indeed there are reports of drums being shared, lillies being painted on for the twelfth and shamrocks painted on the same drum for the 15th August. With the stronger links within the Orange the loyalist drumming tradition has survived whilst the nationalist tradition has abandoned it.  Rhythms are played with many areas having their own rhythm associated with it, sometimes even two, of times played with an accompanying fife. The most commonly played rhythm would be the so called 'twelfth of July time' which is an alright tune but lacking very much in local quirks and originality. 

Drumming matches are really more about the qualities of the drum than the drummer. I seldom go.

***Loyal Orders.***

The Loyal Orders have gone through quite a bit of change over the course of time, I'll try to get the main points in.

**Reformation and England**

When the Reformation happened it was quite a shake up all over the world but especially in Europe, the pope had quite a bit of political power and any threat to the Catholic religion was a direct threat to it's power, so Europe was quite tumultuous for quite some time, with principalities siding one way or the other. England had a odd relationship with the reformation, Henry VIII flitting back and forth to suit his own ends led to a succession that was quite mixed,  subsequent monarchs had differing levels of tolerance for other religions, despite the of times brutal suppression of Protestantism it continued to grow. Following the joining of the crowns and a civil war which consolidated more power to parliament, Charles II was quite tolerant in his own beliefs and was a nominal Protestant, his brother on the other hand was not a Protestant and parliament tried to pass a law where they could pick a nice Protestant successor, namely Charles' illegitimate son, but Charles dissolved parliament instead, and then converted to Catholism on his deathbed. 

**Glorious Revolution**

When James (Charles' Brother) came into power he started doing some things that set alarm bells ringing in the minds of Protestants, placed Catholics into high ranking posts in the army and started taking arms of Protestants (at a time when there were no police or any protection from miscreants or criminals.), a practice that was followed every time Protestants were attacked and oppressed by the state. This was okay however because it was just one King, it wasn't going to last long, his heir being Mary, a Protestant married to a nice Dutch man, who happened to be at war with France. When James had a son, things were a wee bit more serious and parliament decided that things best change. They invited Mary and her Husband to take the throne, passed the Bill of Rights which enshrined in law some of the rights James had taken away from Protestants and the act of succession, and other limits on the Monarch's power. Naturally James wasn't pleased about this and went to his cousin in France to get a bit of help, in return James was expected to join in with the French against the Dutch forces.

**Williamite war in Ireland**

 England being filled with Dutch troops and Protestants was not the best place to start a counter rebellion so he went to Ireland where there were plenty of Catholics.  James did all right in Ireland until he besieged Londonderry, the tide changed after the siege was lifted and the Williamite war was won at the Boyne, following that there were still pockets of resistance which were cleared up with a fair amount of vigor, however at Aughrim it could be argued that it was quite unfair. 

So Following all that we have a free people in the form of the Bill of Rights (a very influential document) and the start of parliamentary democracy, things well worth celebrating, the church of England was free from a king suddenly deciding to change sides however it was still an established church which certainly wasn't going to be helpful in the next hundred years especially in Ireland.

**Formation of the ABOD**

A few years later a group of men decided to create a society to remember the freedoms defend at Derry and the brave men who shut the gates. This version of the Apprentice Boys of Derry did not last terribly long. However there were smaller similar groups: Orange, Purple, Black, Loyalist etc that existed through Ireland for the next hundred years.

**Battle of the Diamond**

A hundred or so years later, religious tensions in Ireland were at a high, a man by the name of Dan Winter got word that he was going to be attacked. Being a prominent Freemason he went to his lodge for help, they told him he was on his own. Dan quickly went out looking for aid and gathered a group of Protestants to defend his home.

Following the battle it was decided that having a group of friends and a community to look out for and defend each other probably wasn't a bad thing, so copying the formal lodge structure of the Masonic the Orange institution was born. A lot of smaller clubs and societies became lodges and warrants were issued, districts were formed, these districts were organised within the counties and the counties formed the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland (which had its headquarters in Dublin until the Irish civil war after partition). 

Although it was started as a defensive militia of sorts, it really was about bringing Protestants together, forming communities and friendships. After all if you heard your friend was being attacked you'd happily go to their aid, some random Protestant you never met probably not so much.

So the Orange was formed and decided on its beliefs but still no tradition of parading.

**United Irishmen**

Just 3 years after the formation of the Orange the United Irishmen rebellion had began, aided by the French. Although there would have been many within the Orange who would have agreed with some of the ideals of the United Irishmen, the emphasis of the Order was still very much on the defensive. The Army was in need of recruits to help fight against the Irish forces and militias and yeomanry forces were formed, often by recruiting from Orange lodges, not unlike the USC and UDR) It was here the tradition of parading was formed, with the parade in two ranks being a hold over from British irregular forces.  The bands naturally formed up to complement the parades.

As the years have gone by the focus of the orange has changed its no longer there for the physical defence of religion but has transitioned to a more community orientated social religious and sudo political group.",0,1403776204,null,0,false,0,cihgpf2,t3_2921af,t1_cihgpf2,t3_2921af,null,1434410367,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

You clearly know nothing about me or about how I have previously criticised Islam and the actions of Muslims. However, I criticise from a position of evidence rather than emotion. Whilst Muslims from the Indian subcontinent do appear to come from a culture of electoral fraud that is not the same thing as saying all Muslims come from such a culture or that non-Muslims from the Indian subcontinent do or don't also come from a culture of electoral fraud. 

&gt; why is it so wrong to point out what a poisonous religion this is

It isn't so long as you get your facts straight and properly source your evidence that supports these facts. Making blanket statements like

**2 Chronicles 15:12-13**

&gt;    Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.

**Exodus 22:19**

&gt; Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  ""The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.

**Jeremiah 48:10**


&gt; While the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men defiled themselves by sleeping with the local Moabite women.  These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods, and soon the Israelites were feasting with them and worshiping the gods of Moab.  Before long Israel was joining in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the LORD's anger to blaze against his people.  The LORD issued the following command to Moses: ""Seize all the ringleaders and execute them before the LORD in broad daylight, so his fierce anger will turn away from the people of Israel.""  So Moses ordered Israel's judges to execute everyone who had joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.  Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into the camp, right before the eyes of Moses and all the people, as they were weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle.  When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this, he jumped up and left the assembly.  Then he took a spear and rushed after the man into his tent. Phinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man's body and into the woman's stomach.  So the plague against the Israelites was stopped, but not before 24,000 people had died.

What happens is that revenue from the Crown Estate goes to HM Treasury, part of the Crown controlled by Parliament, rather than to the Sovereign them self. This is due to the agreement originally made by George III, which is renewed by every monarch.

Prince Charles, on his accession, could decide not to renew that agreement.

I very much doubt he would, because the real reason that agreement was made was because until then the sovereign was still meeting the costs of civil government himself, and those costs were greater than the income he received from the crown lands and various feudal rights. Parliament controlled taxation and by this point paid for the military.

So not renewing that agreement could see the costs of civil government, now several hundred billion pounds a year, return to being the responsibility of the sovereign, while the sovereign would only gain a quarter of a billion in revenue.

People make out that this agreement was a one way deal which saved the monarchy from bankruptcy, but it's really an important step in how this county's constitution and democracy developed, because it's the point where parliament took control of all the purse strings, and consequently paved the way for the monarch to be sidelined in how the country was run, because from this point on the government was paid for by parliament and the people.

It's pretty much impossible that Prince Charles wouldn't renew the agreement due to how important it is to the country's constitution.

&gt; I doubt it. They will forget about it after the hysteria and sensationalism calms down. Other clubs have players far worse than Suarez, and they sure aren't hurting sponsorship wise.

When a big company is interested in becoming a sponsor they will have a full risk assessment on every eventuality. If Liverpool come out of this ordeal looking bad then a potential sponsor will see that as a weakness and would be reluctant to offer contracts.

Over half their major honours have been in the era where they've had almost an unlimited budget for buying world class talent. Who's the last player Chelsea developed in their youth system and played consistently in the first team? They buy the talent (granted not as much as City but still much more than any other club) and pay astronomical wages very few other teams can afford in order to win the league. There's no developed style of football over 10, 20, 30 years. It's just whatever style suits their most expensive player this season. There's no building up and developing young players to integrate into the squad alongside one or two world class players, there's no soul to the club. That is buying titles my friend.

They may have created more chances but it was widely acknowledged against the ""big"" teams they parked the bus and played some of the most boring football known to man. I have friends who support Chelsea and even they were complaining about it. 

Also goes to show Liverpool are the better team, creating less chances but scoring more goals...

in the late 90s/ early 2000s, Chelsea was pretty much your Arsenal/Tottenham of the Premier League. We were finishing around the top 4 pretty consistently, but due to massive debt, could never break into the top 2. Sure in those early years a massive injection of capitol was needed for us to catch up with United and Arsenal, but that is no longer the case! Are you aware that liverpool currently operate at a greater Loss than Chelsea do? (2012/13 figures show a £50m loss vs £44m).

Sure there isn't a culture of adding youth to ""one or two world class players"", but that's because out team is already young and world class. 

Courtois - 22. Hazard - 23. Oscar - 22. Schurrle - 23. Salah - 22. Lukaku - 21. these are all great young players who (will) be playing for us next season. we also have one of the best youth loaning systems in the world. 

Sure against you and Atletico (away) we ""parked the bus"", but sometimes you have to do what you have to do! our second team defended very well against you and we won, derailing any attempts you had at winning the league.

It's a trick question because they would go up. You wouldn't have the benefit to the economy of all the Royal events, the palaces are already partly open to the public so no change there, tourism would decrease because there wouldn't be such an allure (especially to the Americans), and our trade would be seriously impacted as the Royal Family indirectly account for about £780m of trade deals a year by just turning up, hosting trade shows, encouraging local investors, meeting foreign heads of state who have influence over purchasing decisions, and generally increasing the standing of the UK around the world.

And then would you want a President in their place? Because most countries spend almost as much on one president and his/her immediate family per year as we do on the whole Royal establishment. And Presidents don't have the standing in the world that Royals do because Presidents are normally political, and people just don't trust them as much.

Also, the weekly meeting between the Prime Minister and the Queen has kept a lot of Prime Ministers sane and focused, and they've admitted as much themselves on a lot of occasions.

Here is the current standing in terms of seats.

There's also a report on party membership which can be downloaded from the page below:

UKIP have slightly more members than the Greens but still considerably lower than the Lib Dems and the SNP. In terms of membership, Labour are the biggest.

The also have control of zero councils, despite having the 4th highest number of seats (below the Lib Dems).

The only list that they appear at the top of is the European Parliament, which I guess makes them the biggest UK party in Europe. Green are 4th.

true,StavromulaDelta,null,null,"I've got a lot of experience from taking hayfever remedies for 2 decades now. As a teenager I would rub my eyes until they bled, sometimes on a daily basis. I have been told by doctors that they don't do steroid injections anymore because of side-effects and them not being significantly better than tablets and sprays. 

Here's what I do each day:

**Wake up**

* 180mg Fexofenadine (standard is 120mg for hayfever and 180mg is for severe [Urticaria](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Nettle-rash/Pages/Introduction.aspx) but I pursuaded my Doctor to perscribe the higher dose as my Mum was on it for hives.)
*  Beconase Nasal Spray, one in each nostril. Make sure your nose is clear and tilt your head forward as you do it. DO NOT INHALE. I found out last year that I had been doing it wrong for 20 years. You're supposed to let it sit in your nose.

**Home from work**

* Chlorphenamine 4mg. These can make you drowsy and you're not supposed to drink or drive machinery on them. They put me to sleep for the first few weeks each year but then I get resistant to them. 
* If it's a bad day then I'll take another nose spray dose. My prescription says one a day but over the counter it sometimes says twice.

**Night Time** 

* Maybe another Chlorphenamine if needed, but usually turn the lights off and pass out.

**General**

* Ibuprofen is an anti-inflamitory and if I'm feeling puffy or my nose is blocked up (usually due to swelling, not snot) then pop a couple of those.
* Eye drops. Use them liberally as soon as you get the itch. If I don't then I end up touching my eyes and get whatever's on my hands in my eyes and makes it 1000 times worse.


**EDIT**: These are the antihistamine tablets I've tried over the years in  order of effective to shit

* Fexofenadine (prescription only)
* Mizolastine (Can't find these anymore. I think Fexo replaced it)
* Chlorphenamine
* Cetirizine
* Acrivastine

About our 6-0 demolition of Arsenal.

&gt;We had that efficiency where every chance was a goal. I know it was a historic result. That one stays for a long time. The three points were important, especially at that stage because Arsenal were so close to us, but at the same time when you get this kind of result in a London derby it means a bit more to the fans. One day we have to lose [against Arsenal], and when that day comes maybe people will forget what happened before. The reality is in this moment we have never lost against them [with Mourinho in charge] in more than a dozen matches and we have always had good results. Whatever happens or doesn't happen, this 6-0 is something the supporters will not forget easily, and at the end of the day we play for them.'

His thoughts on Eden Hazard and his performance during the campaign.

&gt;I understand this beauty and these magic moments he brings to the game are what the fans enjoy the most. Obviously the fans enjoy and respect people like Gary Cahill, Cesar Azpilicueta, John Terry - people that are so stable during the season and do an incredible job for the team - but people like Eden bring the magic and win matches in one action. They have the flair and the artist's touch of the football. At the same time, he was not just that. He had a big evolution and he scored more goals than before. His work-rate for the team improved a lot too, so for a player like him he deserved it and the fact he was recognised by the fans gives him for sure more appetite for the next season to be even better.

And finally his thoughts on the upcoming season and what he thinks of Chelsea's future.

&gt;Next season will be very, very difficult, even more so. I know Chelsea will be better, but maybe the other teams will be better too, so it will again be the kind of league where you don't know if you're going to finish first or finish sixth. In this moment I have to think and feel and say we want to finish first. I enjoy this club, I like the club, and I like the league. I love the way people live football in this country. I was a little part of the process that made Chelsea a force in the last decade, and I come back with the dream to try to be a little part again of the next decade. After 10 years of titles and great moments, this is a moment to rebuild again, because teams don't last for ever. Clubs yes, but not the teams. In the same club you have to build another team. That's what we are doing, and for sure the results will come.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"If you want a city, Leicester is pretty nice, especially around the university, and quite cheap. But if you want really nice, quiet, relaxed, pretty, low crime and good community, without being expensive, Shropshire is the place to go. Nearby Wolverhampton has good train connections, but you wouldn't want to live there. My town in particular, Bridgnorth, is awesome, becuase:

* Cinema. Not many towns our size have a three screen cinema with 3D. Bridgnorth does. Yay! Also it's cheaper than the big cinemas like Odeon and Cineworld, and has less adverts - mostly before the listed start time of the film so you're not waiting half an hour after the film was meant to start before it actually does start.

* Steam railway. Good day out over to Highley Engine House or Kidderminister - and you can see elephants in the Safari Park from the track which is cool. Also the Railwayman's Arms at the station is a great little pub.

* Theatre. We've got one, and an unconnected amateur dramatics society. There's all sorts of things on, comedy, drama, music, play readings etc.

* Festivals and events. We have an annual music festival in August and an annual carnival (this weekend! Hooray!) and at Christmas there's the Victorian fayre and market in the high street with crafts and food and people dressed up and everything.

* Great cafes. Most of the cafes are local independant businesses. Chat with the owners and staff when it's not too busy and you're pretty soon one of the family. They often have homecooked cakes too. Delicious homemade cakes.

* Loads of history and old stuff to visit. There's the old ruined castle that got blown up in the Civil War, the steam railway, the cliff railway, and the early locomotive the Catch Me Who Can was manufactured in Bridgnorth - something that local ice cream parlour Knickerbockers, located at the bottom of Cartway next to the medieval bridge, has commemorated with a delicious ice cream called Catch Me Who Can.

If your statements don't proceed from reasonable premises through deductive rules to a conclusion, then you are just speaking nonsense. 

""Picking on the way you argue"" is pointing out the problems of your argument. We cannot determine anything at all by shouting over one another what our opinions are. 

I asked for a source (I humorously said ""sauce"" because it was so ridiculous) to the assertion that Distanceboy made that *all Muslims believe in killing infidels*. You replied with just a bunch of rambling from your own head. That is not a source. That is not an unbiased survey of Muslim belief. It was just a load of opinions you have. I called you out on it, and pointed out the capitalisation because it doesn't lend weight to your 'argument' that you cannot perform basic grammar. 

The logical way to tackle this would be to provide a source that all Muslims believe in killing infidels. Of course that's impossible because it's an incredibly stupid thing to say.

I love how you used the figures for External debt, rather than [Public Debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt) (You know, the one that matters) which is:

UK: 90%
US: 72% 

But sure, the UK has marginally greater Public Debt as a Percentage of GDP but this will most likely change mainly as Economic growth is greater in the UK. Economic growth recorded for this year is: [Source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10752204/UK-will-be-fastest-growing-economy-in-the-G7-this-year.html)

UK: 2.9%
US: 2.8%

While the source shows [here](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/government-deficit_gov-dfct-table-en) that the budget deficit in the UK is lower as a percentage than it is in the US. Budget deficits:

UK: -5.3%
US: -5.8%

In regards to your point to do with the GDP Per Capita between the countries, I take your point, but is also worth noting that the US is considerably more unequal than the UK?. Well, why does this matter? Well you have one of highest GDP's one of the larger developed countries but have the 34th out of a survey of the child poverty rates of 35 countries as shown [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/04/15/map-how-35-countries-compare-on-child-poverty-the-u-s-is-ranked-34th/) as it states ""The United States ranks 34th of the 35 countries surveyed, above only Romania and below virtually all of Europe plus Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.""

true,WhaleMeatFantasy,null,null,"I think there's a false dichotomy between knowing stuff and understanding stuff. I don't think people who are calling for more factual knowledge are suggesting students should just be given a list of dates and events. (Side note: this is pretty much what history teaching amounts to in Japan.)

The more facts at your disposal the richer your understanding of any given movement is going to be. The flip side is that it is very basic pedagogy that understanding something helps you remember it.

&gt;How important is it to know the exact date the First World War started, compared to understanding the consequences of the chain of events that lead up to that event (with fuzzy memory of the exact dates and figures of those events).

I would count both these examples as being knowledge of the kind to be recommended. I quite agree that being able to recite dates does not amount to much. But to know the events themselves and their consequences is still valuable learning.

I would contrast that with a shift to the kind of history source analysis questions which are, in some cases, becoming prevalent, where you don't need any real prior knowledge but are just expected to jiggle around with what's provided on the page and evaluate where the information comes from. It's basically just reading comprehension.

Another example which springs to mind is what happened to graphic design. When I took the course many moons ago a large proportion of it was learning technical drawing. I came out of the course able to draw in 3-point perspective and do isographic and orthographic projection (by hand).

The year after I took the exam the board dropped the technical drawing requirement. Instead they would show you a picture of a piece of packaging and ask, 'What are 5 things which make this a good piece of packaging?' (A question I remember from a sample paper I saw at the time.)

Good learning (and a satisfying intellectual life), as far as I am concerned, are about making connections between different things.

true,tree_bear,lfc99,,"This guy is an incredible physical specimen. He reminds me of a cannonball both in physique and playing style. Compact, incredibly strong build but with speed and balance and he just goes barreling into everything and everyone. He can get the ball at midfield and leave a trail of carnage and destruction on his way to the goal because he's not only stronger than everyone else but he has a lower center of gravity which (a la Sterling) allows him to get under people and hold his ground when fighting for the ball. If you go back and look at the replay of his second goal you see how muscular his quads are. This dude has in my opinion one of the most perfect bodies for football outside of Ronaldo.

Obviously with more game experience will come more consistency but you can see he is capable of a Robbenesque goal from long range. This ability to take long shots would be huge for our team because it would not only give defenses something extra to worry about but if the keeper parries then the strikers can be there to mop up anything in the box. He can score tap ins and slot the ball past. Incredibly accurate with his left, not quite sure if he uses the right for much more than standing and running. But it works for Robben and Di Maria and I don't see why he can't (in time) do the same things they do consistently.

Instead Mr Cameron decides to give first homebuyers (and second) extremely low deposit mortgages again - while holding the state (government) to ransom by guaranteeing the remainder of the deposit.

How.. fucking.. stupid... You're fucking over first home buyers with irresponsible lending and putting them at the risk of negative equity. Then you're fucking over the state by tying its fortune into the housing market.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; why should I have to pay more tax

Because you live in London where the jobs are.

I know that sounds like a trite answer, but that is exactly what LVT is for.  London is more attractive because the jobs are there.  You've got to remember that location taxes fall entirely on the landowner, so your rent would fall because of LVT.

But really ""why should I have to pay tax"" is a pretty dreadful argument.  Why should I pay VAT on my electricity, since I need that for the computer that I use for my work?  Why should I pay petrol duty, when I need my car to get to my job?

Further, LVT, introduced slowly would encourage the creation of jobs outside of this golden job paradise that is London by making it ever more expensive to have property there instead of somewhere cheaper -- both in terms of staff costs and business premises.",0,1403793161,null,0,false,0,cihlf52,t3_2952d6,t1_cihlf52,t1_cihio4d,null,1434413052,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

and

&gt;Surveys have shown that there is a widespread belief in several countries, particularly Eritrea, Egypt, Guinea, Mali and Mauritania, that FGM is a religious requirement.[107] Mackie and LeJeune write that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, which makes it difficult to interpret the data.[108]

So even many of the people in Muslim majority countries think their religion requires it... so much for us ignorant Brits eh! ;)

However they aren't really obliged to unfortunately, they're just saying ""it's not our problem"" and whilst I don't think it's the best approach there isn't really anything *wrong * with it

What? How does that work? Any extra costs for the landowner are getting passed straight onto me as a tenant faster than you can blink.


&gt;But really ""why should I have to pay tax"" is a pretty dreadful argument. 

That clearly isn't my argument, all your examples people pay the same rates of tax across the country. Those that have to live in high demand areas already suffer because they pay higher rents and because their properties are deemed to be more valuable higher council tax.

Encouraging movement away from London should be done through investment and incentives for other areas, not just profiteering from London until it collapses. London is already a shit ton more expensive for businesses than elsewhere but since the alternatives are pretty poor they stick with it.

&gt;

&gt;__Liverpool Football Club__ /ˈlɪvərpuːl/ is an English [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) club based in [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool). Liverpool F.C. is one of the most successful clubs in England and has won more European trophies than any other English team with five [European Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League), three [UEFA Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League) and three [UEFA Super Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup). The club has also won eighteen [League titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_football_champions#Total_titles_won), seven [FA Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) and a record eight [League Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup).

&gt;Liverpool was founded in 1892 and joined the [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) the following year. The club has played at [Anfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield) since its formation. The most successful period in Liverpool's history was the 1970s and '80s when [Bill Shankly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shankly) and [Bob Paisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Paisley) led the club to eleven league titles and seven European trophies.

&gt;The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the [Heysel Stadium disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster) in 1985, in which charging Liverpool fans caused a wall to collapse, killing 39 [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) supporters and resulting in English clubs being banned from European competitions for five years. In the 1989 [Hillsborough disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster), 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing.

To further back up my theory 9 was kissed by Jack and reacted the same way that anyone would being kissed by someone going off to die, 9 also got hit on by a tree and accepted it.  Same with 10 and cat nuns - and 11 said that he had dated an android once (not necessarily as 11) as well as having had relations with the Corsair while they were biologically male and female.  So while it's fair to say the Doctor *prefers* humanoid females, that's not to say he/she's not open to other genders/species.  The third Doctor once stated once that a Time Lord wasn't actually a 'man or a woman' but they used the genders to not confuse other species.  This has obviously been retconned in the 2005-current series but that fact still remains that The Third Doctor said he wasn't male or female.

Firstly, I had to do the Thinking Skills Assessment, which is quite similar to an IQ test. I recommend looking at some of the example questions to get a feel for what it is like, because practice can really help. I personally found it easy, but experiences seem to vary.

The interview was pretty technical, and not at all what I expected. The interviewers (two engineering fellows of the college) presented me with a series of printed questions, ranging from electrical circuits to fluid dynamics, and got me to solve them while talking through my thought processes. They helped me along when I got things wrong (e.g. I completely forgot how to integrate something). When I got to the solutions, they asked me more general questions about interpreting the results. Mainly they were trying to see if I understood how the maths relates to the real world, rather than just doing routine algebra.

We also spent quite a bit of time talking about one of my interests that the interviewer happened to share, which I think helped a great deal. I think people forget that a big part of the interview is for them to decide if you are someone they can get along with, and think that they can actually teach; if you get in, these people will likely be spending many hours in supervisions with you.

Please be aware that the interview style will vary wildly between the colleges, and between different people. What I wrote above comes from my experience at Queens', but may not be applicable to Churchill.

In my opinion, the Engineering course at Cambridge is really great, particularly because you have so much freedom to specialise however you want.

Firstly is that he has done it 3 times now, which makes it so much worse than an individual incident of madness. He has shown that it is a repeated problem for him and that he has a genuine psychological disorder.

Secondly, is that whilst most terrible things that players do on the pitch are in some way provoked (Take Zidane in the world cup), all 3 times Suarez has bitten somebody it has been almost totally unprovoked and off the ball.

Thirdly, and this one might be a bit unfair, but biting another player is just a bizzare thing to do. If you have ever played football (semi) competitively, you can understand why a lot of players lash out and stamp or kick another player when they are frustrated, angry, tired, etc. but biting another player is just an unthinkable thing to do! it's worlds apart form keeping a foot in a hard challenge because you're pissed off. it's just an assault.

Not like computer hacking, anyway. But it did involve junior reporters being told to hand over private phone numbers of celebrities (violating the trust between a celebrity and junior reporter). And there was ""social engineering"" with employed ""blaggers"" who would call phone companies and ask for voicemail PINs to be reset to a default.

I think this is what caused public outrage. It is terrible to lose a loved one. But it must be horrific to twist the knife and create false hope. That the messages probably expired in the system regardless of outside intervention is now probably moot - that the ""hackers"" had a complete disregard for the emotional state of relatives of a dead person was utterly unforgivable.

Firstly is that he has done it 3 times now, which makes it so much worse than an individual incident of madness. He has shown that it is a repeated problem for him and that he has a genuine psychological disorder.

Secondly, is that whilst most terrible things that players do on the pitch are in some way provoked (Take Zidane in the world cup), all 3 times Suarez has bitten somebody it has been almost totally unprovoked and off the ball.

Thirdly, and this one might be a bit unfair, but biting another player is just a bizzare thing to do.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; What? How does that work? Any extra costs for the landowner are getting passed straight onto me as a tenant faster than you can blink.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax#Efficiency

""Because the supply of land is inelastic, land rents depend on what tenants are prepared to pay, rather than on the expenses of landlords, and so LVT cannot be directly passed on to tenants""

&gt; That clearly isn't my argument, all your examples people pay the same rates of tax across the country. Those that have to live in high demand areas already suffer because they pay higher rents and because their properties are deemed to be more valuable higher council tax. 

My examples weren't geographic, but things like ""I need to travel to work so I already suffer because of all the fuel duty I pay"" are exactly the same form of argument as yours.

People in ""high demand"" areas might suffer because of high rents, but they don't live there because they like paying money to landlords, they do it because they perceive they are better off doing so -- there are compensatory advantages.  It's not correct to paint your choice of work location as something that was forced on you and resulting in only negative outcomes.  The very fact that you say your job is only available in London is also the very thing you are paying higher rent and council tax for.

Assuming you aren't a multi-millionaire, you would, in fact, be better off with LVT, since your below-average price accomodation would attract less LVT than the really expensive parts of London.

&gt; Encouraging movement away from London should be done through investment and incentives for other areas

That's exactly what LVT does.  It encourages private investment because of the incentive of cheaper property.

It's not profiteering from London in the slightest, it's applying a tax on those who have received unearned advantages simply because of their location.  Location advantages come from society in general surrounding the location, not from any action of the individual who owns the location.

&gt; make London hyper expensive and you probably will see lots of businesses move out, only problem is they will more to Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Singapore or any other a long list of cities which want to steal Londons crown. 

Yeah, yeah, that's the standard London answer to everything: you can't change anything that we already have because all the rich people will run away.  One of your example cities, _already_ has LVT, and is one of the most successful cities in the world:

""In Hong Kong, a government rent, formerly the crown rent, is levied in addition to Rates. For properties which are located in the New Territories (including New Kowloon), or located in the rest of the territory and of which the land grant take place after 27 May 1985, the government rent is levied at 3% of the rateable rental value""

LVT is usually argued for as a replacement for other taxes, not in addition to.  The total tax burden would remain unchanged.  Eventually even income tax and VAT should be subsumed.

Further: why would a company move to Abu Dhabi instead of, say, Leeds, which would suddenly be considerably cheaper relatively?

The idea would not be to simply switch to LVT, it would be introduced gradually allowing enough time for the incentives to alter people's behaviours.

Firstly is that he has done it 3 times now, which makes it so much worse than an individual incident of madness. He has shown that it is a repeated problem for him and that he has a genuine psychological disorder.

Secondly, is that whilst most terrible things that players do on the pitch are in some way provoked (Take Zidane in the world cup), all 3 times Suarez has bitten somebody it has been almost totally unprovoked and off the ball.

Thirdly, and this one might be a bit unfair, but biting another player is just a bizzare thing to do. If you have ever played football (semi) competitively, you can understand why a lot of players lash out and stamp or kick another player when they are frustrated, angry, tired, etc. but biting another player is just an unthinkable thing to do! it's worlds apart form keeping a foot in a hard challenge because you're pissed off. it's just an assault.

He is a pretty boy German midfielder who works really hard, and unfortunately that covers about 75% of his appeal. I just haven't been too impressed with him when we started him outside of EL. He hasn't gotten a good run of games, but I'm not sure that he ever will- he kind of suffers from the same thing Sig does in the sense that he will probably never play consistently in his preferred position (because of Eriksen). I am also not convinced that his best place is as a DM/deep midfielder. He played a few times in a lineup alongside Eriksen as a deeper CM (the 442 with chadli, sig, holtby, eriksen that drew west brom 1-1 comes to mind) and was pretty poor. Holtby won't cut it as a no. 10 and his fans want to pigeonhole him as a CM to drown out the fact that he just isn't good enough to start on a top 5 team. Recently people have been saying to make him the CAM and then put Eriksen on the left and lamela on the right even after lambasting sherwood all season for putting eriksen on the left. Some here are simply deluded and will not let their man-crush on Holtby go. (Leaving out Sig and Eriksen, who I will consider CAMs) Holtby is the best shooter and passer of our CMs. But he isn't the best dribbler, strongest, best tackler, or best in the air. In fact, I would say he is the weakest of our CMs in quite a few categories.

The route has to be quite long to have enough room for the entire procession, my club is usually finished the parade before some have even started. The location however is significant in this case.

Other times the location may not be significant, there are 12th of July celebrations all over the country, none of them have people splashing through the Boyne, my own county of Armagh take turns between the 11 districts, last year it was in Newtownhamilton, this year it is in Markethill, next year it is in Bessbrook.

 So we have to pick a route for next year, talks so far are indicating the route we took last time round, for the most part the districts rarely change their routes, whatever reason they were picked may be long forgotten but it's an opportunity to show off the interesting features of the district and possibly get people towards the shops. If it were me I'd want to show of Derrymore house but its a tad off the track. There is an expected length to these things so you don't want a parade that's too short.

Other places because of the regularity of their parades may have it in the same route every year, often a habit that has gone on so long it is now tradition, while there is nothing sacred about some of these routes I suppose there would be a nice feeling knowing that this is what your ancestors did.

Then there are other places where the route may be the most practical route, or even the only route available, the start point and end points are still the same, and have all the same significance, so the likes of the Ardoyne arterial route, its not a segway to piss people of it happens to be the most practical route for the Ligonel lodges to parade home, to where they meet and live.",0,1403797468,null,0,false,0,cihnh41,t3_2921af,t1_cihnh41,t1_cihgzaf,null,1434413999,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

They don't really play much of a role in your life beyond that point, but they're always ready to help out! Your college advisor is a first point of contact if you want to report any issues in your studies. They review your termly reports and are meant to assist you if you're having trouble with your course or thesis supervisors. You'll enjoy a free dinner with your college advisor in October.

2. Our largest accommodation sites are the Annexe and Stone Mason House. They hold around fifty students each. The main site is my personal favourite, though I've never lived there. Wellington Square is also close to college and quite nice, though I don't think there are more than 10-12 rooms available. I recommend you check out the Facebook group ""OxGradHousing"" to find private accommodation at this point. For the following academic year, you should start looking around as early as this coming December!

3. Firstly, St Cross is a large grad college. The traditional undergrad colleges usually have relatively few graduate students (less than 60!), meaning there are few events tailored to them. St Cross is very, very active socially, and should you wish, you can easily join the Student Representative Council and involve yourself in improving the college experience. Secondly, St Cross is quite diverse in the subjects studied by its members, and there's always a lot of excellent conversation to be had, whether with students or college fellows. St Antony's is a grad college in which the vast majority of students are in political science or area studies. This also has its advantages, of course, but I find the social atmosphere there carries a different vibe as a result. Just my personal opinion. Thirdly, the college is small, but incredibly beautiful. I truly believe its front quad is only surpassed by Worcester's! Pusey House is an under-appreciated affiliate of the college; be sure to use its library, which is much larger than ours.

4. My impression of college only improved as time went on and my relationships deepened. I joined the Student Representative Council in December of my first year as Careers Rep, and since January, I've been the Health and Safety Rep. Our college is in a very interesting transition period at the moment: the last five years saw a lot of maturation as we began hosting balls, renovated our bar, and designed a second student common room. The administration is slowly growing to trust us more and more. Most importantly, we'll soon build a large extension to the main site which will revolutionise college life.

* While he was banned at the start of last season, Liverpool had 3 wins, 1 loss, 1 draw. That's 5 dropped points. If we had those points at season's end, we would have won the league.
* He's now banned for 9 Premier League games, 3 Champions League games, and a few more domestic competition games. How many points might we lose this season that could effect *all* our key campaigns?
* We can no longer sell him for his full value this summer (even if we had wanted to). So we won't be able to get in more players of sufficient quality to sustain a run at the EPL and CL.
* Past controversies -- Evra, Ivanovic, transfer demands -- have pulled the club through the mire. 

While he's delighted us frequently, the man has damaged the club just as often. The tone of people's feelings about him need to be free of romantic notions of his value. He's caused as many problems as successes.

If Rodgers was being honest when he said, ""No-one is bigger than the club,"" then Suarez needs to be sold. Let others delight in his skill and despair in his madness.

I will now take the brace position for the tsunami of hate that I suspect is heading my way.

You'll find in countries where women are valued, like norway and sweeden, instances of rape are lower than in countries where they aren't, like Nigeria or basically any other African country you can think of.

You would be hard pressed to find an historically black country that has fewer cases of rape than an historically white country. I mean, you know this already, but for some reason need me to tell you, and now you'll probably pretend it's not true, even though it obviously is.

If cultural differences exist why do you find it so unbelievable that sometimes those cultural differences may lead one group to be more likely to commit rape than another? Or do you limit your acknowledgment of cultural difference to ""they're so much better at dancing than we are""?",0,1403798206,null,0,false,0,cihnuby,t3_29249p,t1_cihnuby,t1_cihgapl,null,1434414172,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I can't see any major long-term effects anywhere near what would occur with continued smoking. The ingredients are fairly simple and have been deemed safe for human consumption. 

Nicotine alone is nowhere near as harmful or addictive as people make out. The principle addition factor in cigarettes are naturally occurring MAOI's (which are like anti-depressants) and these work to enhance the effect of nicotine. You can feel this first hand.

Sweden? You mean the country that has the highest number of rape incidents in Europe, and one of the highest in the world?

Zimbabwe has a lower incidence of rape than the United Kingdom - http://www.statisticbrain.com/rape-statistics/. Egypt, Mozambique adn Sierra Leone all also have lower incidences of rape than many historically white countries - http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Rape-rate.

Because you're assuming that black British people have a different culture to white British, when black British are probably the most integrated ethnic minority, and some black British groups are intermarrying other groups so much that they could disappear in a few generations. Also, if people have monolithic cultures based on their race, why do Indian British people not rape as much as Indians from India itself?

The official land registry deeds still show the Crown as the owner of vast estates, especially around Sandringham etc, and people who rent properties on the lands there pay their rent to the Crown. That makes the outright owner the Crown, not the government or the state. The deal made by George III was that the profits went to the treasury, it didn't transfer the ownership of the lands.

At Real Madrid, he had Makelele covering if he went rampaging down the left, but was often caught a bit short in the defending area. Think Glen Johnson with bigger thighs and a teeny tiny bit more talent.

true,sea-weed,,NC15-20,"My brows are very dark and lately I've been practising different ways to make them look defined but not overpowering or too severe!

My favourite brow products are:

- Anastasia Dipbrow.  I use the Ebony shade and apply a tiny bit along the bottom of my brows using an angled eyeliner brush (mine's from Ecotools) and blend it upward before brushing through with a spoolie.  I also use this to fill in any patchy bits.

- Benefit Gimme Brow.  I use Medium/Deep as the last step in my brow routine, lightly brushing it over the arches and tails with a bit more on sparse areas.  It adds subtle fibres to make my brows look fuller and keeps them tidy.

- A matte mid grey-brown eyeshadow.  Currently using one in my Kat Von D Ladybird palette.  I apply this using my Real Techniques pointed eyeliner brush to the inner brows (closest to nose) for a gradient effect that adds depth and looks more natural.

- Tweezerman Slant Tweezers.  These are the sharpest and most precise, and I have quite a few pairs to rotate between use and being sent back for free sharpening service.

If you're new to shaping, I'd suggest seeing an experienced threader and explaining what you'd like them to look like.  After that you can maintain the shape yourself using tweezers.

Scenario 2) The club does want to sell. In which case we will get considerably less than we did before. This, as is the case in scenario 2, is not good.

You seem to know so clearly that the club doesn't want to sell him, how do you know this? For all we know FSG have had enough and want to get rid of him before he fucks up again.

My major problem with them is the lack of luggage space, the one time I travelled on a Pendolino most of the people in the carriage had their luggage stacked by the toilet and vestibule because there was nowhere else for them to put it. Changed trains at Crewe and the 20 year old Class 158 we caught to Chester had more luggage racks at the end of the carriages than the Pendolino did!

Having travelled on Voyagers and Pendolinos I can't say I've noticed the toilet smell on either of them, maybe it's more noticeable if you're at the end of the carriages.

My Dad served 10 years in the Royal Navy including the second world war and 3 Russian convoys. He was a CPO . He was lucky enough to keep moving ships before they were sunk e.g. The Rodney. He was involved in the sea battle that sunk the German Pocket Battle ship 'the Sharnhorst'. His last ship was HMS Jamaica which was used as one of the Destroyers in the film 'The Battle of the River Plate'. He was trained by the Navy to become a Master Chef (after he joined in the 1930s to escape the Great Depression and his parents could not afford for him to go to the Grammar School in Blackburn) and finally became personal chef to Admiral Hughes-Hallet, cooking for dignitaries such as Lord Louis Mountbatten. He never wore a ring because he saw too many men lose fingers loading breach guns aboard ship in battles. He also had a beard a sea which saved his face from scaring when a gun flash took it off! When working in the magazines in action he told me they were locked in from the outside! He said he had never witnessed deprivation before of the kind he saw in Murmansk amongst the Russian people. A chocolate bar handed to a child was immediately ceased - all available food went to the troops fighting the Nazis on the front.

Otherwise, it is a very good piece of journalism-blogging. I find the anecdote about the House of Lords being forced to debate a piece of legislation which wasn't finished particularly interesting, because it kind of spits in the face of Parliamentary democracy.

However, I kind of think that the author's judgement at the end is wrong. He's saying that both the 2008 Act (which makes minimising green house gas emission a statutory priority) and the 2014(5?) act (maximising petrol production) will both be in effect at once and 'make the Department for Energy's head explode' but what will actually happen is that the 2008 Act will simply be overwritten in places where it contradicts the 2014(5?) act. So it's actually sort of, slightly worse than he makes it out to be, because maximising petrol production *takes priority over minimising emissions* because the Infrastructure act is newer than the Climate Change act.

.

&gt;Along with his comments about Henry, the party's candidate in Enfield Town, London, has tweeted that ""Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich, strength through violence against the citizens"". He said Muslims ""like us to fawn to them"" and ""young Muslim men remind me of young Afrikaners. They are taught at an early age they have the right to abuse"".

Islam is organised crime under religious camouflage. Any Muslim who is not involved in organised crime is not a 'true believer', practising Islam as Muhammad commanded"".

.

&gt;And, earlier this month, in the wake of allegations of police corruption in the investigation into the murder of Lawrence, Matt Pavey, a Ukip candidate in Lewisham, tweeted: ""Does anyone remember the name Jean Bradley murder unsolved in Acton, London, in 1993. Anyone looking for corruption here? No, thought not."" Pavey tweeted two days later: ""Lets all take a moment to remember Jean Bradley stabbed to death on the streets of London in March 1993 and no justice #stephenlawrence."" And again that day he tweeted: ""Lets please take a moment to remember Penny Bell stabbed 50 times in London 1991. No justice #stephenlawrence."" Pavey said he was not prepared to comment on his tweets but that there was ""no malice"" intended.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Xenophobia itself is probably genetic in origin, and it can be explained in terms of evolutionary biology. The underlying problem is that a section of the population is biologically incapable of living in a multi-ethnic society. When that is imposed on them, they become frustrated and angry.

What do UKIP voters want? Essentially, a mono-ethnic and mono-cultural nation-state. Typical UKIP supporters in the United Kingdom want to live in British neighbourhoods, inhabited by British people, where English is spoken on the street. They want British shops with British staff, British hospitals with British doctors and nurses, and they want to work with British colleagues, for British employers. They want British schools with British teachers, where British children learn British culture and history.

From these aspirations, the policy follows logically. Society must be structured, so that they can live with each other as much as possible, free from the foreign elements which distress them, and contradict their aspirations.  Those who do not want to live separately from foreigners, would simply not choose to do so. 

Segregation has a bad name, and it would contravene national anti-discrimination laws. Those laws must therefore be repealed. The segregrated white British population must get their own education system. They must get their own registered businesses, which can  refuse employment to foreigners and minorities, their own healthcare system, with their own separate hospitals, and a separate media sector.

Equally the rest of the population, and their institutions, would be empowered to refuse access to xenophobic individuals. The result will be a gradual segregation of the economy, with the emergence of a separate ""white sector"".

I know that many people will dislike the idea of segregation. The international community would be enraged. What is the alternative, however? A frustrated, bitter, angry, and increasingly radicalised minority inside the indigenous population, that cannot be placated by any political stance of the elite. And then: more Breiviks, random killings of immigrants (as in Germany), bomb attacks on mosques, a competition in migrant-bashing between the main political parties, and ultimately some form of pogrom or forced repatriation. That is the logical end point of current trends: segregation is a better alternative.

This is a 6-8-10 midfield. Pretty common a lot of places, especially the Netherlands. Belgium are playing like this most of the time these days. It's a really good system.

The only thing I would say is that I think Oscar can play the 8 (box-to-box) role really well if given the chance. He's incredibly fit, and underrated defensively. I think he offers so, so much more than Ramires in possession that it's worth playing him in there.

If you want to catch up to the latest season, then start with Matt Smith's episodes (The Eleventh Hour, series 5, episode 1). Since they introduce a new companion at the same time (Amy Pond, who acts as a direct conduit to you, the audience), it's easier to figure out what's going on, since she's experiencing the stuff for the first time (Daleks, Cybermen, and terms that have existed for 50 years of tv show), same as you.

However, if you want a good feel for the overall storyline of everything new, start with Rose (series 1). There's a few more seasons to watch before you're caught up, but many of those episodes (especially in David Tennant's time) are the best in the history of the show.

If you're a little crazy, watch whatever Netflix has to offer, starting at the beginning. (Okay, since so many of the episodes are lost, it's not 'really' the beginning.)

[Neil Atkinson](http://www.theanfieldwrap.com/2014/06/suarez-bites-man-think-words-write/) had a great piece on the incident, and I think he eludes to a really good point that we (society as a whole) view bites different than a blatant stamp, punch to the face, kick, or a malicious two footed tackle.

You can bite someone and they'll be able to play minutes later, but you look like a psychopath and you'll have the book thrown at you (especially if it's offense number 3). 

You can break both their legs with an insane tackle, end their career, get a 3 match ban, and you look like an aggressive dick of a player. You can have a few of these incidents as we've seen with players like Pepe who have a reputation for being dirty, but we've got this obsession that biting is a totally different story. 

Maybe Luis is wired a little different. Clearly to him a bite is a clever equivalent to an elbow, a fist, or a tackle.

The standard ban is three games. This ban amounts to 20-something games not accounting for friendlies. It's unreasonable that a bite is THAT much more awful than an elbow to the face or a kick to the head (Fuck off Shearer). Even considering his previous record of biting it's incredibly harsh. You don't punish a third-time offender of assault with an imprisoning of 20 months if the standard jail time is three months. It's just not just.

In my opinion the ban is unreasonably harsh for Luis Suarez, but even more so for LFC. The club will be without a player for 4 months for an offence he commited in another shirt and will pay more than 3 million pounds in wages during that period of time, and all without a chance to appeal.

true,MrNorbertHubitch,null,null,"The ban is disproportionate, that's for sure. However, I feel more let down by Suarez in all honesty. We've stood by him completely, sometimes at the detriment of ourselves. I don't think people blindly defending him helps him change at all, whether the robust defences come from Liverpool or Uruguay. The guy clearly needs help. Nobody knows the full extent of his private life, of course (as it should be) but it seems as though he is a perfectly charming man off the pitch, who channels all of his demons when he crosses that white line. What he does on the pitch may not affect him too much off it. He has a loving family with him and he's obviously financially comfortable, it's possible he's perfectly happy to channel all of his emotional energy into his job. He's also a winner though, and I'm certain that he'd like to improve as a player and help the sides he plays for win trophies. Missing 10 games a season through suspension won't help his cause in that respect.

He needs help but he needs to help himself. All we've ever heard from him is excuses. It's the fault of the English media, FIFA, referees, other players . . . never himself! He needs to recognise that what he has done is wrong and is hurting him, Liverpool and Uruguay. He needs to be willing to admit his mistakes and also to be willing to try and change his behaviour. It doesn't help that everyone who wants him to succeed are going out of their way to excuse or proportion blame elsewhere. He needs to accept responsibility but if everybody is excusing everything he does, then why would he? He's still loved no matter how bad his behaviour is. That's part of the problem. In shirt, he's a spoilt child who does whatever he wants because it's reaffirmed by everyone who matters. Those who condemn it are the enemy anyway.

As a club, we need to support him and make sure he knows that his behaviour is costing us dearly. If the fallout of that is that we lose him, so be it.    Uruguay (the FA, the fans, his teammates etc.) need to do the same. Mostly, Suarez needs to face up to his responsibilities. He's twenty-seven years old, a father. He's not a child and he needs to grow up. FIFA could also do something. Instead of merely just punishing him, they could try and help him, try to start a conversation about how players' psychologies effect what they do on the pitch. It can manifest itself in a punch, a kick, an elbow, a nasty challenge, spitting, a headbutt, a bite. People sometimes lose control and allow their emotions to take over. Somebody earlier mentioned that a headbutt is premeditated whereas a bite is instinctive. It's absolutely not the case. Both can be either, but usually both are instinctive. Most people, even when emotionally charged, are able to control their actions to a large extent. Suarez is one of those that struggles with this. The worst thing is that we're reaffirming his behaviour by making FIFA the enemy. Just like he is himself. I'm pissed off with him, and you should be too and he should know it. He needs to change and it would be very nice if he could recognise this himself so that he can begin the process.

Everyone says this.  Also whenever interest rate rises are talked about it's ""it'll be passed straight on to the tenant!"" 

I don't buy it, most rentals (in terms of month-to-month cashflow) are profit-free already.  Do you think it's because the landlord, out of the kindness of their own heart, are making a property available at cost; or is it because that's the most they can get on the market?

Rental prices are set by supply-and-demand just like everything else.  In fact I could argue that since no-one rents something unless they actually need it, rental prices are a more accurate measure of property value than property prices (on account of for-sale prices varying due to speculation).  Rental prices are literally what someone will pay to have sole occupancy of that property for a set period of time, what could be a purer measure of it's worth than that?

He has also received bans for abusing officials, the above incident involving repeatedly kicking a player on the ground and punching someone, as well as somehow escaping a ban for a couple of stamps on Lionel Messi. He is clearly a player just as incapable as Suarez of controlling his emotions, and just as likely to commit violent and indefensible acts. And even if he isn't in the same quality bracket as Suarez, as a regular starter for Real Madrid he's hardly a low profile figure in the game.

And yet there is no suggestion when he gets sent off against Germany that he needs help. No suggestion that he has mental problems. No suggestion that FIFA need to take a hard stance as he hasn't learnt from repeated incidents. No suggestion that FIFA need to take a hard stance to protect players. 

People will say a headbutt isn't as bad as a bite, but the general rational provided for Suarez's punishment is that he is a repeat offender who hasn't learnt. Well here is another repeat offender who hasn't learnt. Yet there's no reaction to FIFA's 1 game ban. No suggestion that he won't learn anything from such a short ban. No suggestion that they're not taking the issue seriously. No suggestion that it's an inadequate suspension for a player who has a long history of going around doing violent and indefensible things with no real provocation.

**I hope we sell Suarez this summer.**

Don't get me wrong. I love the guy, and it'll kill me watching him play for someone else. But even if we ignore the various ways in which his behavior has hurt LFC, the deciding factor for me is this: *he's obviously going to do it again.* 

Whatever his issue is, it's obvious that it's going to continue. We all thought he was over it, but he obviously wasn't. To me, that suggests he's never going to be. 

And when he does, he's going to get a lifetime ban, or something close to that. 

I mean, given the atmosphere in England and the media's attitude towards him, can you even *imagine* what the FA will do if he puts a *toe* out of line in a Liverpool shirt ever again? He'll be crucified. 

In essence, what I'm saying is that I expect that even if Suarez isn't sold, it's only a matter of time before his Liverpool career is over anyway as the result of his own continued insanity. 

YNWA holds true and I will always like and support Suarez, but honestly I think the best thing for the club at this point is to sell him, especially if the Sanchez + cash rumors are true. Yes, he's irreplacable. But he'll be even *more* irreplacable if he bites someone again six months from now, gets a lifetime ban, and then LFC has $0 to replace him with.",0,1403809376,null,0,false,0,cihtkm1,t3_2968al,t1_cihtkm1,t3_2968al,null,1434417047,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Costa, or any other striker that comes in, is relevant to the conversation despite when those quotes were made. He wants to play every game. He will more than likely not get that here next season if we pick up Costa.

""When you're better than the current starting striker yes he has every reason to think he's earned the starting spot.""

That's incredibly subjective. Torres/Eto'o/Ba have certainly been far from stellar, but you can't say Lukaku would have worked out any better. He hasn't done anything impressive in a chelsea shirt. 

Regarding Sturridge, I do feel we sold him to soon, but I don't think it was a matter of Chelsea not realizing he was talented. He didn't work in our system, and even more so now, if anyone values their system over any individual player it's Mourinho. If Lukaku doesn't produce results consistently, and quickly, or if his attitude goes against what Mourinho feels is the good of the club, he will be loaned or sold. Deal with it.

It may, may not. There isn't evidence for it (as far as I know).

Even if there is, it's a feeling that we should try to withhold. Why? Because it harms others.

The quote above may seem normal but see the quote below:

The underlying problem is that a section of the population is biologically incapable of living in a society where paedophilia is illegal.

Paedophilia is only frowned upon by the society because it harms others. Xenophobia is frowned upon for the same reason. There's no reason why we should be advocating for segregation.

&gt;Segregation is a better alternative.

It isn't. Xenophobia has increased recently because of various factors, but I would guess that most of them comes from how we feel about society and that trend is worrying and we should be doing everything we can to stop that trend.

It is, in itself *not* a pejorative term or a racial slur.

It is *still* used in it's historical context to this day, for example the [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum](http://www.nlbm.com) in Kansas, The [United Negro College Fund](http://www.uncf.org), a still active minorities scholarship charity organisation, and the [National Council of Negro Women](http://www.ncnw.org), another charitable organisation. 

It should be noted that the designation *Negro* [still appeared on the U.S. census form](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/us-census-bureau-negro-respondents-race) until *last year*.

You'll notice all of the above is in relation to the United States as the word does not hold the same historical stigma here in the U.K. but is still not a preferred description.

Suarez is an exceptional player and we need him in the squad to play at our current level; I'm not sure if everyone here is serious when they claim that we don't need him or he's doing more harm than good. Yes, he's tarnished his own reputation with his stupidity, but why does that portray the club in a negative light? Because we have him?

I don't know about anyone else, but football, to me, is not a moral sport anyway; people dive, they cheat, they kick, punch, headbutt and elbow other players, there's racism and there's fights...and that's not even mentioning the unscrupulous way some teams go about recruiting players. Suarez biting three times is disgusting and wrong, yes, but people are only reacting so violently to it because it hasn't been seen before in the game -- it's a new type of violence and one that everyone is kind of unsure how to react to.

Now we're on the biggest stage in world football, and he does it AGAIN! again, in front of literally tens of millions of people, he totally unprovoked, bites another player! 

This is not a case of a player elbowing another player in the box, nor is it even a stupidly reckless 2 footed challenge, it isn't standard ""violent conduct"" - it is an assault. When one plays football, there is a certain level of physical ""abuse"" that is to be expected. you cannot complain if somebody hacks you down, or elbows you, or head-butts you (not like zidane) in a game of football, because they are all relatively normal actions in the game which can occur both accidentally and on purpose. I have played amateur football quite a lot, and even then tempers can raise and players can go into challenges recklessly, trip on purpose, elbow one another, and generally ""rough each other up""; what I have never seen is an outright unprovoked assault on another player - and that is just at amateur university level football.  

sure these things do occasionally happen, and they also get heavily banned - pepe got 10 games for example for his first offence (less than Suarez's first ban) of unprovoked violent conduct.

What I'm saying is (and you have said as well) is in a game of football, there is, as a normal course of playing, contact with elbows, hands, feet, knees, etc.  By and large most of these are accidental and no big deal.  Some are intentional, but still more irritating than dangerous.  Sometimes they are malicious and obvious, but it's rare.  Usually it's hidden behind a 'legal' attempt to get the ball.  I'm pretty sure no one tried to ever win a ball using their teeth, though, which means the bites are completely intentional and designed to solely inflict injury on the opposition and had nothing whatsoever to do with the actual game of football.

The conclusion in the two situations may be the same (""he's obviously not actually threatening her"") but in the first instance it's a private conversation between two people who are intimately involved and have established a certain level of trust. In the second, it's because if Fabricant was going to attack Brown, he would neither announce it on Twitter beforehand in an off-hand inappropriate joke, nor would he continue having a political career.

The difference is that Fabricant is a relatively high-profile politician (he's not cabinet-level but he did hold a vice-chairman position within the party in this parliament; he's one of the more recognizable MPs), and as such it's totally inappropriate to make comments such as these on Twitter. Even if he doesn't mean it. Whereas the boyfriend doesn't make these comments about a stranger he doesn't like, and doesn't make them in public. And he doesn't hold a position in the legislature where he could be perceived through these comments as being insensitive to issues like violence against women, although I admit that that's tenuous.

On the other hand, YAB is obviously going to capitalize on this. It already meets the criteria for her to complain within her paradigm (I think she gets an unfair rap on Reddit, for the record, though she's not a saint). Since it is obvious that it wasn't a real threat, she's not really relevant enough to the debate, I don't think. In another situation where it could more reasonably be construed as a threat, she would of course be relevant.

Xenophobes are only tempted to harm others when they are forced to mix with other races and cultures. And being forced to mix with other races is a harm to them, in fact. I think we should let people go their separate ways without judging them for something they cannot help.

&gt; Paedophilia is only frowned upon by the society because it harms others. 

There is no evidence I know of that proves this is always true.

&gt; There's no reason why we should be advocating for segregation.

I do not see how this analogy holds. Segregating the paedophiles from the children would not make paedophiles happy, whereas all that we need to let the xenophobes be happy is to segregate them. I suppose if a distinct, politicized segment of the population wanted to be free to have sex with their own children, you could argue for letting them be free to do that, but as far as I know there is no such segment.

The other is younger and not yet disillusioned, although she does have her heart set on emergency medicine, which one assumes is marginally less prone to budgetary constraints than general practice.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Indeed - research is useful and it stops us (me!) believing wrong things. On that note: do you have links or similar to the research you've seen?

With regard my initial comment, I would have once upon-a-time said similar but with a caveat with regard instances like, say, rape committed by a sober/not-as-inebriated individual on someone who was pass-out drunk (let's ignore the potential that the rapist isn't ""aware"" that their opposite number is incapable, for now). In that instance then surely, if a guy has been chatting up a woman all night, and they end up in bed but she's completely out of it and can't consent, and he ends up raping her, then it was about sex rather than him wanting to ""take her power""?

However, in order to fulfil a sexual desire, you have to be willing or want to ""take"" or to ignore that the other person is powerless or that you're over-powering them. That's the reason I would stick by the first comment: the rapist is dismissing the lack of power of their victim, or giving reign to theirs, as opposed to the act being completely sexual.

In so far as the ""not-aware"" rapist instances - I think that they are so few and far between that it's not worth clouding the issue. Having said that it could still be argued that not gaining consent, or not realising that the other person cannot, is an issue surrounding privilege, which is itself tied to power.

But I'm open to hearing/reading your thoughts and sources.

true,rcxdude,Robinson,Robinson,"I'm just about to graduate from the engineering course. I had a decent amount of experience with programming and electronics before applying (e.g. I played around with repraps in sixth form), and my grades were A\*A\*AA in maths, physics, further maths, and electronics (I took it early, the year before the A\* was introduced). So your marks look OK, it'll come down to your personal statement and interview (where the key is to say what you're thinking out loud!).

I would say that the Cambridge course is good if you want to be 'well-rounded' as an engineer, with the general nature of the first two years, and you can do some oddball combinations of modules in the later years, if, say, civil and information turns out to be your thing (I actually had to do structural calculations in one of my 4th year electronics module exams!).

On the other hand, the workload is huge (as far as I can tell you learn as much about each of the subjects as a more specialised course expects in other universities), and your results depend most strongly on pure theory: pretty much all of the subjects boil down to lots and lots of math and if you don't enjoy or are good at it then you're going to suffer a bit (I was a bit of a glutton for punishment: I really like control theory so I took a lot of modules on it but I suck at the heavy-duty maths a lot, so my marks suffered). There are some practical parts of the course, and they are quite fun and valuable for learning but they're not really important for your marks at all (it's really easy to get enough marks from them, so almost everyone is about level, and all the marks are for the quality of your report as opposed to ability to execute the project).

As another point, I would recommend you join one of the engineering societies. There's a solar car team, an autonomous flight and underwater vehicle team, a formula student team, a spaceflight team, and an eco-house team. If your aim is to learn a lot about engineering, then join one of these and put the effort in to contribute something (just showing up to some meetings to put it on your CV is pointless). It can be hard to do because of the aforementioned workload, but it really is valuable experience (of a different kind from an internship / work experience, which you need to do anyway), and gives you a huge boost in comparison to other candidates (not only does it give you something extra to put on your CV and talk about in the interview, but many of the sponsors of the team will sniff around looking for good candidates: about 50% of the senior team on the solar car project got jobs almost directly from working on the project. You also will gain connections which can be valuable for getting your foot in the door at employers).

true,iMisconception_fixer,null,null,"&gt;Paedophiles are only tempted to harm others when they are forced to mix with other young children. And being forced to mix with children is a harm to them, in fact. I think we should let people do their thing without judging them for something they cannot help.

Again, what you've said also applies to paedophilia.

&gt;&gt;Paedophilia is only frowned upon by the society because it harms others.

&gt;There is no evidence I know of that proves this is always true.


It's well-known that paedophilia is not choice. Some people say it's mental illness, some say it's sexual orientation, others say it's fetish. It doesn't matter, it's not really something people can choose. (Otherwise why do paedophilia even exist?).

Let's compare homosexuality to paedophilia. Neither of those are choices. Both are attraction to specific group of people. There is no difference between them except homosexuality means both of **consenting adults** can engage into sexual activity. This cannot happen for paedophilia as it's not possible to have young children to consent into it due to laws. 

[Here's a discussion on this matter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/1figxc/paedophilia_prof_at_griffith_university_says_we/)

&gt;I do not see how this analogy holds. Segregating the paedophiles from the children would not make paedophiles happy, whereas all that we need to let the xenophobes be happy is to segregate them.

This analogy does hold because it harms others. That's the point of this analogy. Segregation would harm others who do not want it (Hint: It's the majority). 

Scenario: A man aged 35 wants to have sex with girl aged 15. Can he do it? No. Why? It's illegal. If she does consent to it? It's still illegal because she cannot consent.

Even if he's nice person who genuinely thinks she's beautiful and has no intention of abusing her? It's still illegal because if this was allowed, it would harm majority of people. 

&gt;Xenophobia itself is autonomous, and not responsive to political process or government policy.

That's not true. You might want to read little bit of history, especially ones relating to rise of Nazi party, Golden Dawn, etc.

What, only love him when he scores and gets us in the CL, then dump him to the kerb when he obviously knows he did something wrong and can't control himself? 

Shame on you.

Because otherwise he's going to do this again and get a lifetime ban for it because the FA is even more likely to crucify him for this than FIFA was. 

I'd rather get something for him now than lose him for nothing in 6 months or a year when he ends his career with whatever his next bit of madness ends up being.

To be fair I have seen flaws in that website's maths before as they do tend to extrapolate out assumptions.

But you're right that doesn't make sense. It can't be skewed the spanish way can it? 

Maybe Man U gets a cut of international licences such as asian markets? Maybe they get a higher cut of that. I just realised I hadn't considered what UEFA actually do with the money from countries outside Europe. 

Looking at the docs from this season and last season it is remarkably strange, United are the only club that increased their market pool amount, whereas, City, Arsenal and us all had decreased values. 

Also the docs I am working off. (for reference of others and yourself)

That's a crock of shit though, not passing harsh sentences for false accusers (which, despite it's portrayal in the media, is extremely infrequent) would *help* rape victims, because like they said fear of harsh prosecution for making a claim that doesn't have evidence deters real victims from coming forward. The issue of false allegations damaging the credibility as an argument is bullshit, if people don't take rape accusations seriously then that's their fault, they are the ones victim blaming and it's their own shitty attitude if they don't respect allegations based on some tiny minority of false cases.

Reddit has this massive obsession with false accusations like it's the biggest crime against humanity since genocide. Without a doubt false accusations can be an awful experience for individuals but this kind of reactionary attitude towards false accusers isn't the solution to the issue and I think it only adds to the much bigger problem of victims not being able to speak up i.e. the vast majority of cases that actually are rape.",0,1403818092,null,0,false,0,cihy1i4,t3_296cn3,t1_cihy1i4,t1_cihurvx,null,1434419085,-53,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-53

Why do you think public debt matters more than external debt? [Most public debt in the US is owned by Americans themselves.](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17424874/) External debt is a better metric because it compares nations by how much they owe *foreign parties*. It's better for determining the financial independence and strength of a country.

As I showed, the UK is over four and a half times deeper in debt than the US is.

Hah! the very first thing you said is that I'm cherry picking statistics yet that is exactly what you did.

Your own link has US growth at 2.8% and 2.8% for 2014 at different points. For the UK it's 2.4% and 2.9%. The person I replied to was saying the US economy is going down the toilet. Your own link shows the growth projected growth rates for 2015 for the US at 3% and the UK 2.5%.

UK child poverty rate: [27%](http://www.cpag.org.uk/child-poverty-facts-and-figures)

The US and the UK also measure poverty differently. The US poverty threshold is an individual making [$11,700](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq1.htm) a year or less. 

The poverty line in the UK is someone making [£100 a week or less](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_Kingdom#How_poverty_in_the_United_Kingdom_is_defined_and_measured). Equivalent, to $7,800 dollars a year or less.

In all competitions for Liverpool, he played in:

**13 out of 14 in 2010-11 (Missed 1)**

* Rested vs Chelsea in PL because of fitness issues

* ***NOTE***: *I did not count the 4 Europa League games he missed because he was cup-tied as he'd already played in Europe for Ajax that season. That's not his fault.*

**39 out of 51 in 2011/12 (Missed 12)**

* 8 game ban for Evra incident

* 1 game ban for flicking off Fulham fans (9)

* Rested for Chelsea League Cup match in November (10)

* Rested for Fulham league match in May (11)

* Rested for Blackburn league match in April (12).

**44 out of 54 in 2012-13 (Missed 10)**

* Rested for the away ties vs Gomel (1) and Hearts (2).

* Rested for the away ties vs Young Boys (3) and Anzhi (4)

* Rested for WBA match in League Cup in September (5)

* Suspended for WHU match at Upton Park in December (6)

* Suspended for biting Ivanovic. Missed final 4 games of season (10)

**37 of 43 in 2013-14 (Missed 6)**

* Suspended for first 5 league games of season for biting Ivanovic

* Missed League Cup game vs Notts County (6)

**2014-15 (Misses 13)**

* Will miss 9 league games, 3 CL games and at least 1 League Cup game

**At the moment** he's played in 133 of 162 available matches up to today. That means he's missed 18% of them. After this new ban, he would've missed 24%.

I live just a short (and nice) walk from harborne high street (about a 15 min walk), and there are plenty of hotels at a range of budgets nearby, all on the Hagley Road which is one of birminghams major routes into and out of the city centre. They aren't very exciting but they are on major bus routes (though I don't know if they specifically get you up to the hospital). If you're hiring a car you can drive to the QE in about 10 mins or so. The immediate area of the Hagley Road is not very nice but after 30 seconds walk south you'll be in Edgbaston and then Harborne and both are very peaceful to walk around - we go jogging around our block and like to look at all the big expensive houses! 

Failing that if you stay near Five Ways rail station or University station, you can catch a very short train to Selly Oak which is close to the hospital. 

Let me know if that might work for you and I'll PM a list of the hotels in the area. Hope your son/daughter gets well soon.
