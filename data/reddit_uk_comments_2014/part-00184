There have been nights when I've gone home and cried over my inability to provide the families in my care with the support they deserve. 

Where I work we still manage to see the most acutely unwell kids straight away but those with mild/moderate anxiety or depression have to wait up to three months for an assessment. Following the assessment will have to wait up to 6 months to be allocated a clinician by which time they will either have improved and no longer need intervention or they will have fallen into crisis and will need a much more intensive package of care than previously thought. As a result of this the children's wards of our local general hospitals are increasingly full of kids who have taken overdoses while on the waiting list for therapy. 

One of the reasons the waiting list is so long is because the majority of our time is taken up with kids who are extremely unwell and need to be in hospital for their own safety but there simply isn't a bed available for them so we have to try to somehow keep them alive and functioning in the community. When they eventually do get a bed it will most likely be hundreds of miles away from their home and family because inpatient provision is so scarce and mental health beds are constantly being cut. 

The longer children and adolescents have to wait for help the more likely it is that their mental health problems will continue into adulthood yet Early Intervention services are being slashed. It's a lot cheaper and easier to  treat someone before their mental health issues become chronic but the powers that be only care about saving money now so the heavy investment in preventative mental health care that we desperately need to improve and sustain NHS services is simply not going to happen.

One fantastic computer game for learning about soccer is Football Manager. You can buy it from Steam. They might have the one for this past season on sale now since the season's over. Last I checked it was like 70% off but I'm not sure if that was temporary or not. This was about 2 weeks ago. I get the game every year but find I have less and less time every year to play. It's highly addicting though but also can be incredibly frustrating, but it will really teach you a tonne about the game. More than you could learn in ages otherwise. It gets involved in everything, the playing side and the business side of the game. I couldn't recommend it any more, get it! :P

Also, check out /r/soccernoobs. It's about 2 weeks old and its full of questions from new soccer fans. I tend to go over there to answer questions a lot too, so you'll probably see me around sometime.

motd.fm.vn - for 'Match of the Day' highlights of Liverpool games.

Remember seeing some defender just running up to a free kick and smashing the ball way off too, in what I believe was nothing but him believing the free kick had been taken and that some clever routine was in motion.

I have nothing against Scotland or Wales (in fact I used to live there), but after reading your reasons for leaving Quebec they may not be your best choices right now.

true,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;The tenant would be in breach of their contract. Tenants have a right to peaceful enjoyment but that doesn't mean total exclusion of the landlord.

If the tenant signs the contract to say they will pay £1000 if the rent is late, they're in breach of their contract, still an unenforceable term. Not mention that practically, If you have changed the barrel, not told the landlord and they approach you about it, you can be fairly sure that they have tried to gain access without your consent. Relevant to this discussion? Not really - but you can be sure that a court would be interested if the landlord suddenly did decide that they wanted to try and enforce such a term.

Renting your property essentially does mean total exclusion of the landlord (and anyone else!) There are 3 reasons a landlord may enter your home and I say your, as unless you are evicted by court order, the home is yours and not the landlords. This is even if you're not paying rent, the tenant has trashed the place or you think they've abandoned.

1. You invite them in
2. They have a court order
3. There is a *real* emergency

Note that I am not saying that strictly enforcing these terms as a tenant is going to do you any favours. Further discussion here by a group of people with much more experience practising law than me, http://www.landlordzone.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?26589-L-s-right-of-access-for-inspection-or-viewing the above is my understanding and as I believe is summed up in that thread, landlords would be wise to believe what I have written to be true and tenants to believe it untrue.

&gt;The landlord may still enter with reasonable notice under certain circumstances, for example emergency maintenance if e.g. flooding in the property affected a neighbouring property. If they had to make a forced entry under such circumstances as a result of not having the key, I would expect that they would be within their rights to charge for any necessary repairs.

I would argue that if indeed your landlord (or anyone else) did have to force entry in an emergency, that they would also be obligated for repairs in order to make safe ans secure the door as it is covered under the landlords obligations, section 11(1)(a) of the 1985 Landlord Tenant act. The would be the same as if the emergency services had to force entry, or a passer by acting in good faith. I would agree that the the tenant is liable for repairs to the door if the emergency was caused by the tenants action or inaction.

&gt; In addition, changing the locks may invalidate any insurance the landlord has taken out on the property if the locks were not up to the insurers requirements.

Changing the barrel would not affect the security/durability of the lock.",0,1403997694,null,0,1403999753,0,cijn40x,t3_29bwc2,t1_cijn40x,t1_cijmaxx,null,1434449813,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

You could (with a friend present) ask him if he was involved in whatever situation-- camp, church, etc. and if he was ever in the neighborhood you would have been in. If there's a chance your parents would be able to track down or know his real name, I would talk to them about it and try to find out. 

I understand that you have worked through the issues surrounding this, but it's SO important that it not happen to someone else if you can help it. While you wouldn't want to implicate someone who is innocent, I would absolutely call the police, tell the person's employer, or go to the media if you can verify the person has molested someone in the past.

Big Disappointment; May seem like a cop-out, but Suarez. Yeah, he looked good when he played, but he's let Uruguay down in a BIG way with his stupid antics. Also; Steven Gerrard. Not totally his fault, but it's clear he's well past his best football. And last but not least, Yaya Toure. I was expecting big things from him this tournament; he looked positively average.

Little disappointment; Akinfeev, the GK from Russia. He was supposed to be the rock at the back of that team, one of their marquee players, a successor to Lev Yashin in the great history of Russian goaltenders, and he looked poor.

true,Woodentop_renegade,null,null,"I'm not a lawyer, I'm a police officer. Lets talk use of force here because its worth talking about it in depth. 

There are two main powers to use force (unless you're a police officer, then there are three but the third is really only to do things related to PACE). 

1) common law self defence. So R V Palmer is a famous stated case and there are others. 

It can be summarised as follows ""A person has the right to use such force as is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances in the defence of his self or another or in order to prevent a breach of the peace."" - What this means is that you can use force to defend yourself or someone else (you're 20 year old bloke is probably going to be able to defend himself better than an 80 year old granny). 

Breach of the peace - It's not a breach of the peace and quiet. You cannot use force against the person likely to be the victim of the breach. ""A breach of the peace occurs where harm is done or likely to be done to a person or in his presence his property."" - So its quite a strict definition.

The other main power is section 3 of the criminal law act. The criminal law act provides that ""A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large."" 

This is an any person power (meaning you do not have to be a constable) however it can (and is) also used by police officers. That means that if you spot someone committing an arrestable offence (with citizen's arrest you have to be a bit weary because it only covers some crimes and in certain circumstances) you can use as much force as is reasonably necessary to get them to stop or arrest them until a constable can assume responsibility for them.

Anything based on the Geniatech ATV1200 is good, has all the outputs you could want. You've shown you're willing to mess around a bit to set it up, the only people i wouldn't recommend this to is complete tech-illiterates who might be better off with something already set up (you can buy Android boxes with XBMC pre-installed from ebay/amazon but if you can't learn to do this yourself you'll be stuffed for updates. It's really easy now anyway all the boxes are pre-rooted running ICS or later, you can just download and run an .apk for XBMC.  Some messing around with keymapping may be needed, though i've found Gotham to work perfectly OOTB with the Airmouse (around £10 included with some packages).

The reason for recommending AMLOGIC is that it's the developers' target hardware, so most stable + video format compatible.

Super Jan's never shown amazing finishing skills and an eye for goal that the likes of Ade and Soldado have shown last season or the one before that. 

I'm not saying Holtby should be played in the middle *just* to start, I'm saying is that he's got a skill set which our other midfielders lack at the moment. 

EDIT:fair enough on the never having played in the middle part. However, Holtby has said that he sees himself more as a number 8 than he does a 10. Will find a source on this soon. 

[I've found an article detailing his debut year at Schalke](http://bundesligafanatic.com/lewis-holtby-germanys-most-versatile-footballer/)

*There is a reason many coaches prefer more seasoned players in central midfield.  It is a mentally demanding and physically exhausting role but like he did at Aachen, Bochum and Mainz, Holtby adapted and performed well enough for Stevens to keep him there. He didn’t equal the level of performances he had at Mainz but he more than held his own and managed to score more goals than he had the previous season.
If anything, taking on a more defensive role and having more responsibility on the pitch might have even improved him as a player. It wasn’t the most memorable season for him but it was a crucial one in his development, especially having a player like Raul around him to learn from. The maturity in his game was seen all throughout 2012 as he captained and almost single handedly led Germany’s U-21s to the European Championship taking place later this summer.*

So, Clara gripes totally understood and valid.  River, I believe, is likely out of the picture(with a fairly good farewell in Name of the Doctor).

But with this new season we have a new Doctor, one who will have to be good based on his acting and character not because he is a Mr. Hottie-pants (a trend with Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith each getting progressively more attractive and appealing to the fan-girl/boy audience).  A Doctor who is being introduced as morally complicated and of deeper character potential.  

We have the quest for Gaillifrey and likely a more involved role of the Time Lords.  Which will open all sorts of different potentials and story lines, conflicts across time.  

A new strong male minority companion, Rory and Captain Jack are phenomenal characters due to the contrast they are able to provide to the Doctor of that time.  

What appears to be a bigger role for UNIT, whose involvement will bring a more human involvement in the doomsday scenarios.

We have a step back towards what made classic Who so rich and immersive.  I think that they have been trying to one-up each season and episode by doing what has always been done with the revamp, only bigger and better and with more silly gimmicks and shiny explosions, and as much as we love those (I own a fez, bc you know, they are cool) it has grown old.

For 13/14 he had an absolutely ridiculous purple patch, probably the best I can recall ever seeing by anyone if I'm being honest, for 16 games (Sunderland away to Stoke away) where he scored 22 goals and had 10 assists.  The rest of the season was still good, but nowhere near that level, with 9 goals and 9 assists in the final 17 games.

It also bears mentioning that in the PL era only 1 player has ever had back to back 30 goal seasons.  Sure, Suarez could be the 2nd guy to ever do that, but he could fall back into lesser Suarez form as well, added to which he could well do something stupid at any time and get a massive ban by the FA.  

So long as we get what we are after in terms of money and/or part exchanges, I don't see how it would be a disaster at all.  I seriously doubt we'd get relegated even if we sold him and did nothing at all and for me that's about the only thing that can be classed a disaster.  Might we end up 5th without Suarez but instead with others in the side?  Perhaps, but it's not like we didn't finish 6th, 8th, and 7th with Suarez in the side previously and there's every chance we could do much better than that as well.

I really don't understand all the doom and gloom people seem to think we'd see if Suarez left.  Is he good?  Certainly.

Basically the whole article is malarkey of the highest order, not an ounce of truth found anywhere about this supposed £110m splash out after the resulting sale of Suarez which the article indicates is pretty much done, or at least, no factual evidence for anything said. 

This article, is a sum of our recent interests, being mixed with the recent incident and uproar of Suarez, and being sold as something that is set in stone. 

There is absolutely no proof either way that we are going to stick by Suarez or sell him, it is all assumption, yet in this article, it suggests that Liverpool are poised to sell, thus, I would suggest it was very close a to lie, because the intent in the wording is to suggest that the deal is close to done.  

It's like you say, the club is hardly going to comment in suggestion of a sale, so there is no way the journo writing this can know what the club's stance is on this other than guess work and assumptions. 

It makes me laugh, that someone will post a link to one of our players being sold, and the article will have no quotes, and they will be down voted repeatedly and people will call for the sub to tighten the rules, and then an article with no quotes or source will be posted about us buying a big name player and it will be upvoted, its double standards. 

In fact, let us look at the article in depth.....

First line 

&gt;Liverpool are now stepping up their pursuit of Chile’s Alexis Sánchez 

Are they? Are they though? where is the proof for such a statement?

Second line

&gt;as they prepare to sell Luis Suárez to Barcelona

Proof please? prepare to sell is a suggestive term that insinuates that we are poised to sell, therefore is requires more information to back it up, unlike if words such as 'may sell' were used

&gt;More than £110  million worth of transfer targets **have been** secured or are **being lined up**

Again, its suggestive language trying to stretch as far as it can without needing to provide evidence. 

&gt;there now appears an acceptance at Anfield that he will go despite signing a new long-term contract.

Proof? Or are the fans being used to gauge this? an 'acceptance' at Anfield? I see no proof, I hear no proof, that's because there is no proof. 

&gt;ahead of the club’ss Champions League campaign next season.

Not one to pick on mistakes, but this is a major newspaper.

&gt;Liverpool will announce on Monday that they have signed Adam Lallana from Southampton for £23 million 

Will they? It's not definite until its done.

&gt;and will also make a move for another Southampton player, Dejan Lovren, the central defender, who will cost more than £15 million.

How do you know this?

Its annoying how people are quick to believe stories based on no facts what so ever as long as they are positive to their overarching opinions of what the club needs. 

Sure the reporter could have more information than us from inside sources, but I doubt that, to me this is nothing more than an fantasy article being used to draw readers and increase traffic. 

Not trying to be argumentative btw :), just proving a point.

It's true that acts of parliament are published and made available online, but by their nature they are difficult to understand, leaving the populace at large hopelessly dependent/at the mercy of a professional legal class.

I've looked into some laws, such as trespassing, and a handful of traffic laws. Quite a lot of things are not technically illegal, that is, forbidden by statutory or common law. Instead, private institutions (which are nominally a part of the government bureaucracy, in most instances) may sue under civil law, which is supposedly a means of resolving disputes. In practice, the time and expense involved in contesting a 'fine' levied under civil law makes them unavoidable.

For normal people, the rule is this; obey the police, and obey the rumours about laws. The law is not for you to understand. It is made by your betters. Do not resist or defy; you will be punished with fear, boredom, frustration and costs.

That all said, you obviously should check up on laws, and there are guides out there to help you do that. JFGI.

This is quite a good, even, distribution, considering he was playing right midfield. 9 (22%) of Willian’s passes were made in the defensive half, with the remaining 25 (78%) being made in the attacking half. **Out of his 25 attacking half passes (most on the team), 10 of these were made in the final third.

Even though it was built as a rich town in the 1840s, by the (19)60s and 70s it was a poor area, student accommodation for London universities, Church owned land, brothels, drug dens and so on, like much of the inner city really.   In the early 80s they wanted to convert our Communal garden into a car park.   Even the big old villas on the canal were split into apartments or occupied by eccentrics, writers, charities and so on.  I remember being mugged quite a few times as kid by people from one of our local council estates.  Little Venice is funny because it's located kind of between Paddington, Kilburn and Edgeware Road, and there are a lot of estates nearby. 

Today a full house on the street I grew up in goes for between £10m and £12m.   The old houses that people used to live in on the canal go for between £16m and £18m a piece.   Little Venice is a very rich area now, probably the prime overflow area from Kensington and Chelsea, and a big choice for rich young families because of our communal garden.  

I still very much like the area.  My parents still live there, and the influx of wealth has led to some very cool shops and restaurants opening up.  The gardens and canal paths have been cleaned up too, and I notice a lot bigger police presence than when I was a kid (apparently crime is still quite high).  I suppose LV is an example of 'extreme gentrification' since it went from a poor area not to a middle class area but a super-rich area, but I still think my parents neighbours are nice and so on, at least when I stop over to visit them. 

I am very sad that I will probably never be able to afford to live there.  But overall I think it is a wonderful neighbourhood and I'm happy it's cleaned up.

So what exactly are you trying to say here? Willian is better than Hazard now?

This completely proves my point, statistics like this don't prove shit. Hazard was clearly miles ahead of Willian in terms of importance and performances and then you try and spout up stuff like this.

If you have to dig around for ""articles"" and every damn statistic in the book to make a player sound good you know something is not right. We all watched every game of the season, we all saw Willian play. We don't need to look at pass percentages to know he doesn't make killer passes that lead to good chances or goals. 

The most important statistic for an attacking player are goals and assists. All other statistics should only support those two. All you are trying to do is substitute them. You sound nearly as bad as those Barcelona fans who think possession % is more important than goals.

The incident has nothing to do with Liverpool, as it was 1) his country, 2) in a different continent, and 3) unrelated competition. Your arguement is looking more like an opinion rather than the big picture. What's against the club here? What's at stake? Sponsors haven't pulled their funding yet. FSG hasn't sold him not once (racism), not twice (ivanovic), and this season is very iffy. It's clear that FSG and Rodgers believe that if you're good enough to play, you're good enough to stay. I think it's a good thing that LFC has become more involved in their footballers lives. I mean, not only has Suarez's behavior on the pitch become model (half his yellows, seldom diving), but the team as well has benefited from LFC's services. The whole team had won the fair play award, and their players constantly applaud the man management of Rodgers and the team psychiatrist.

It's damaging for *himself* as a player and his image, for sure. And then again, Suarez didn't talk shit during the moment of silence, when 96 important lives of the Liverpudlian families were lost. He's not that kind of person. He's just screwed in the head when it comes to competition. His anything to win mentality shows at a much more severe and blatant disrespectful form, when it's not his moments of magic and brilliance. I won't condone that mentality. No one should. It should be punished. Actions have consequences. However, it doesn't warrant severed ties and renouncement. When you have his *teammates* supporting him and vouching his character on and off the pitch, something is off. When he was accused of racism, his fellow black teammates like Johnson and Sterling defended him. When he was accused of biting, his teammates admitted his moment idiocy but continue to claim that he isn't the villain that you seem he is. If Gerrard is willing to sacrifice his credibility to back up Suarez, why shouldn't you believe him?

People think he's an evil person who pulls this regularly. He does look like he does this regularly. I don't think he's evil. I don't think he's misunderstood either, which is what people have been saying either. He's just messed in the head and needs help. Barcelona seems to be willing to take the risk, and I'm willing to bet they'll accommodate his mental instability much like LFC has last season. An absolutely gigantic club like FCB or Real Madrid shouldn't be going after Suarez, what with all the bad press and controversy surrounding him. If he's as toxic as you say, why would they want him? Why would  they want to risk 60-80m pounds to have him banned every season?",0,1404018592,null,0,1404019051,0,cijuci2,t3_29cokd,t1_cijuci2,t1_cijtgb0,null,1434454035,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

Secondly, all you're doing is spreading hate.

Third, that stat proves he CAN BE as good as Hazard, maybe better. It shouldn't be this difficult to understand.

&gt;Hazard was clearly miles ahead of Willian in terms of importance and performances and then you try and spout up stuff like this.

Duh. That was because the team played through Hazard not Willian. When the team has played through Willian he was chosen MOTM and scored a peach.

&gt;If you have to dig around for ""articles"" and every damn statistic in the book to make a player sound good you know something is not right. We all watched every game of the season, we all saw Willian play. We don't need to look at pass percentages to know he doesn't make killer passes that lead to good chances or goals.

I haven't dug around for anything or made anyone sound good. That article was by EPLindex and backed by OPTA stats - two of the most well respected sources. I'm sorry if this hurts your big boy feelings but your are WRONG about Willian and I've provided ample evidence to support that.

We? Are you speaking on everyone else's behalf too now? All you've done so far is talk without any fucking evidence. You aren't a pundit. You aren't a football expert. You your opinion or observations or whatever the fuck you call it have zero significance.

&gt;The most important statistic for an attacking player are goals and assists. All other statistics should only support those two. All you are trying to do is substitute them. You sound nearly as bad as those Barcelona fans who think possession % is more important than goals.

So I guess Oscar must be shit too then with his 4 goals and 5 assists last season. Kroos must be shit too with his 2 goals and 4 assists. Pjanic? Shit with his 6 goals and 6 assists all season in twice as many games as Willian. Kevin Strootman? Also shit with his 5 goals and 6 assists all season. Barkley? Shit. Only 6 goals and 0 assists all season. Wilshere? Shit. 3 goals 4 assists. Want me to go on?

Mind you, Willian has only started in 18 matches, which is half of most of the players I've just listed.

&gt;edit: also, that last collection of statistics is from cherry picked game, which makes it utterly useless in a discussion about an entire season.

Cherry picked? Lmao. Is there no end to your delusion. That was to show you how good Willian is. He hasn't been producing up front as much because he is busy helping out his DM and his fullback; more so than Hazard. But when he does have the freedom to go forward he can be devastating.

Its his first god damn season. There is clearly potential there. Different players take different amount of time to adjust to a league. Why are you pretending to be this thick? ",0,1404019355,null,0,1404019667,0,cijul7o,t3_29c9v4,t1_cijul7o,t1_cijtb0k,null,1434454219,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

I am sorry but this really shows you have a lack of understanding about football. Kroos, Strootman, Wilshere, Pjanic...they all play in a much deeper midfield role than Willian, they are not attackers. If you think they are the same position as Willian and Hazard its best we stop arguing right now.

&gt; Its his first god damn season. There is clearly potential there. Different players take different amount of time to adjust to a league. Why are you pretending to be this thick? 

What the hell is your problem? When have I said he doesn't have potential to be better or can't improve? If we are discussing his performance in the PL last season the fact that it was his first season here shouldn't mean that we change the value of his performances, he played the way he did.

 &gt; that stat proves he CAN BE as good as Hazard, maybe better.

Holy shit man, you can't be serious. Good lord, that stat is nothing. Hazard was on a totally different level than Willian this season performance wise, how can you not understand this?? 

**Hazard &gt; Willian** In almost every category, how can you even make this an argument?

&gt; Firstly, you conveniently ignored answering my question: ""As opposed to what? Your ""observations""?"".

You know what your right. What the hell was I thinking, basing my thoughts on players off of the games I watched. I should be more like you, I should just stop watching matches and head over to whoscored.com and opta to get my dose of statistics.

According to your wonderful statistics Max Kruse seems to be better than Mario Goetze, Robben, Julian Draxler and Isco. Maybe all the top teams in the world seem to be wrong in having much more interest in the other players. I mean Kruse is *statistically* the best player out of all of them...maybe you should give Bayern and Real Madrid a call and explain to them why they obviously have no clue what they are doing...

IIRC the 887VA uses a modem chip that is slightly dodgy on the BT network - Cisco has released numerous updates for the DSL firmware but it can still be finnicky. If you must do Cisco I'd recommend getting the Openreach modem and a Cisco router with ethernet WAN.

Plus IOS has a very steep learning curve if you haven't done it before, and I believe Cisco has locked down their site even more, you actually need a support contract for the specific hardware you want software for these days (although I believe you can get the most basic support contract pretty cheaply if you wanted to stay legitimate).

Their ""enforcement"" is basically buying the Royal Mail address database of all properties in the country and running it against their own list of licence holders. Those who don't appear in both, get sent nastygrams every 5 minutes. 

Sometimes they send one of their salesmen around (an ""enforcement officer"", made to sound powerful like a police officer but isn't in any way powerful, they certainly have no power of entry) to try to gain entry and potentially shop you if you've been silly enough to let them in and are doing something illegal (like watching live TV without a licence). But I think it would still have to go through court, they can't fine you on the spot or anything, and in some cases they're happy to let you pay up there and then (probably because going to court means more time and effort and potentially losing the case for them).

Unless the BBC (or their agents) send you a summons you have nothing to worry about. I wish they were prevented from sending their nasty letters out though - and no, I shouldn't have to contact them and provide personal details to get them to stop. They shouldn't do it in the first place - no other public sector organisation does this, I don't get letters from HMRC about tax fraud or from the police to tell me that committing a crime is illegal.

The thing with a draw is that it is not much better than a loss, of course games like Man City away, 1 point is better than none- but last year we were drawing to the likes of Norwich, Cardiff, Stoke, WBA and Spurs (at home, when they couldn't but a goal).

Do you have any idea what rape is? Does it pertain to only grooming and sexual exploitation of children? Does it only mean stangers? Please quit peddling utter bullshit. Rape is not gangs of men. Rape is not asian, muslim guys grooming children.

The switching service £100 is an incentive to close your current account with another bank and open one with Halifax. They transfer your standing orders and direct debits to minimise the amount of effort involved for you, but as was said above there may be some that you have to move yourself. 

As for the reward current account, you get £5 a month providing that your account is credited with at least £750 and you have 2 direct debits set up. If you, for whatever reason, don't get £750 in a month you don't get the £5. But it will continue as normal the next month provided you put in the £750. 

Before I changed my current account over (I already had the basic Halifax current account) I went into the branch and arranged an appointment with one of their advisors. It was great, the guy I had the appointment with was very helpful and gave some great advice. I didn't even know about the switching service until I went in there (I had another account with a different bank).

I got loud tinnitus which came on very suddenly.  It is a very high pitched ""noise"" and is constant in both ears.  At first, for a week or so, I thought it would go away but it soon became apparent that it was long term - that is basically what I was told by the doc.  I started to become fixed on the sound and listening for it all the time, my sleep stated to suffer and I started to go downhill.  

Then I started vomiting and retching - I became convinced I had a brain tumor or something similar.  This happened multiple times a day and I had to leave my office when it did and naturally started to withdraw - stopped going out completely and even took time off work - which I never do.  I couldn't concentrate on anything else other than the damned noise in my head and I couldn't face a lifetime of hearing it.  At this point I don't think I considered myself anxious but looking back I had started to loose it big time.  Sleep became none existent, my mind started to race constantly, I was still retching all the time and I had started to think of death as a very welcome option. Please note that I didn't want to die but I couldn't see how to live this way - I just wanted it to end.  I started to get obsessive, jumpy and drank hugely.  While alcohol helped to blat out reality for a while it made me much worse in the longer run - massive hangovers do not help with anxiety!  It got to the point of drinking a liter or so of wine in the mornings..

I think at this point if I didn't have the support of my lovely wife I may have done something dumb but she kept me together..

Anyway I got help in the form of some therapy and some SSRIs, stared yoga and meditation, cut back the drinking, got on my bike (indoors on the trainer as I couldn't leave the house at this point!) on and started to get better.

This sort of story is really fairly common if you read the tinnitus forums (which is not the best idea to be honest!) - suicide, anxiety and depression are hugely common in tinnitus sufferers.  I was given hope by posts such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1z4ynq/this_thread_gets_made_every_once_in_a_while_but/) which was so welcome at the time. 

The important thing to note is that it is a two way street to a certain extent.  While loud noise provokes the fight or flight response it also works the other way round in that a stressed mind will make tinnitus more apparent or louder.  A lot of people who have tinnitus learn to use it as a barometer of their anxiety and consequentially learn to relax.

I hope you get over your anxiety and that your tinnitus becomes easier to live with.",0,1404029168,null,0,false,0,cijx1li,t3_29aavi,t1_cijx1li,t1_cij8up2,null,1434455790,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But the poll also revealed a stark gulf between this group and the majority of...

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt;It can be summarised as follows ""A person has the right to use such force as is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances in the defence of his self or another or in order to prevent a **breach of the peace**.""

Which is distinct from the doctrine of self-defence. Whilst they're broadly similar (if you're using your power of self-defence, chances are that a breach is in the offing), Palmer broadly means that if you hit the other person as hard as you can with the first thing within reach, but stop when the danger is past, you're mostly golden. You don't get that same degree of latitude if using force solely to prevent a breach of the peace.

&gt;That means that if you spot someone committing an **arrestable** offence (with citizen's arrest you have to be a bit weary because it only covers some crimes and in certain circumstances)

This is also wrong. The term ""arrestable"" does not feature in s3, and neither does it appear in s24a PACE. As you know, that term was done away with by the SOCPA amendments to PACE - any offence is arrestable provided one of the arrest reasons exists. 

All a citizen need worry about now is, if exercising their s24a power, is that the offence they reasonably suspect a person is guilty of is triable either way and one of the limited reasons exist. Interestingly, the use of force for that power of arrest doesn't spring from PACE but comes from s3 CLA (effecting arrest).

Although it's is a bit more nuanced, the current state of self-defence/citizen's arrest can be summed up thusly:


1. If you have an honestly held belief (even if that belief is mistaken) that harm is about to occur, you can use force to defend yourself, others or your property. Although the niceties of that force don't need to be weighed up as you can act instinctively, you don't get to keep putting the boot in once the danger is past. 

1. You can use reasonable force to eject a trespasser from your property, even a police officer, if they are not there lawfully or you have withdrawn their permission to be there (although in the latter case, you have to give them the opportunity to withdraw before you wade in).

1. If you apprehend an imminent breach of the peace (where the breach is an outbreak of violence or damage to *your* property), or a breach of the peace is occurring or has occurred but is likely to reoccur, you can arrest (using force to do so) until that breach has passed - when you drag your mate away from a fight that's about to kick off, you've just exercised that power. This applies to E&amp;W, in Scotland it's an entirely different kettle of fish and appears to be a common law version of the Ways and Means Act (Police Powers, Amended) 1979.

1. s3 CLA provides a blanket justification for use of force to prevent crime, and to arrest offenders or to effect or assist in their arrest. This, combined with s24a PACE, gives a pretty broad remit for any person who sees something happening in front of them to use a degree of force to ensure that the person guilty of it (or whom you reasonably suspect is guilty of it) can't leave. Really, it simply codifies what you'd expect a citizen ought to be able do when faced with crime happening in front off them. However, the force used does need to be reasonable and there is an expectation that you do weigh the options, bearing in mind that other party can also rely on his right to self-defence if he believes you're going to give him a hiding rather than simply detain them.

I'm not a lawyer. Don't print this out and wave it the old bill if you're stood over the battered form of a shoplifter who's just nicked a can of Tennats Super Unleaded.

[CPS briefing](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/)

maybe they need to update the 'Societal Myth' section...

&gt;The legal definition of rape, including information on when it is to be presumed that the victim did not consent to sexual activity and that the defendant did not reasonably belief that the victim consented unless he can show otherwise. 

&gt;Non-Consensual Offences

&gt;* Sections 1-4 deal with offences where the defendant (A) engages in sexual activity with the complainant, without the complainant's (B's) consent. 

&gt;Rape (section 1)

&gt;The elements of rape are:

&gt;    (A) intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person

&gt;* (B) with his penis;

&gt;* (B) does not consent to the penetration, and

&gt;* (A) does not reasonably believe that (B) consents

&gt;Penetration of the mouth is included.

&gt;Rape is still a crime of basic intent, and drunkenness is no defence.

&gt;Penalty

&gt;Rape is indictable only and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

However, on this occasion, I don't think this is too far from the truth. 

Randy Lerner is looking to sell the club, and it is not surprising that he is unwilling to release a large amount of money for transfers/wages. This is being confirmed by the fact that our only two new players so far this Summer have been free transfers. 

I am very worried for the upcoming season. Our squad is not good enough, as highlighted last season; and two of the three promoted clubs have great potential to stay up. 

Leicester have a fantastic squad, and QPR have a lot of money behind them. Burnley will probably go back down, but I honestly cannot see three clubs worse than us in the Premiership at the moment. 

If I was Lerner, I would make absolutely sure that Villa did not get relegated next season; as a Premiership team is worth a whole lot more than a Championship team. He should make a bit more money available, just to ensure that we have the quality to stay up. Then, if we had a good season, he would have no trouble finding a buyer.

The town has been regenerated with the new shops and the cinema, it seems to be pulling away from Blyth and its working class roots and getting more gentrified. It's almost becoming a nice suburb of Newcastle a la Gosforth/Jesmond. 

When I was younger it was a decaying town, but one with lots of character. Now I feel that a lot of the gentrification and pricing out of lots of people who used to live there has made it more bland. My grandparents and parents who have lived there all their lives say much the same. The new Wetherspoons is one of the most soulless, boring places I've been into, even if it did finally replace ""Flying Chairs"" (The Travellers). Even the Blagdon used to be great four/five years ago and now it's an empty, tatty dump because people can't afford to go out for a drink. 

Now they're knocking down Parkside and replacing a beautiful Edwardian building that's stood there for 110 years with new flats, and I think that might be the death of the last vestige of old Cramlington. 

I know this is a bit /r/lewronggeneration but I feel that while my town in the surface has got more prosperous, it's lost a lot of the things that made it my hometown.

The politically sensitive yardstick of net migration to Britain stood at 212,000 at the end of 2013, a rise of 35,000 over the previous year but unchanged on the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Thursday.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/UK_net_migration.png

Regarding exampes of mass migrations that have lead to wars, history is littered with them. 

Everyone has their own opinion if it is beneficial or not but Europe is experiencing a mass migration for many reasons, that much is fact. 

Lastly on your point of a beneficial dynamic mix of cultures, this is all well and fine assuming those that are migrating are themselves ""Understanding of other cultures"" This is not always the case. Just because the UK has a history of acceptance of other religion and cultures does not mean those values are imparted directly to arriving populations.

Kroos, Strootman, Wilshere, Pjanic...they all play in a much deeper midfield role than Willian, they are not attackers. If you think they are the same position as Willian and Hazard its best we stop arguing right now.

Your argument was Willian's stats are poor for an attacker/playmaker. They are all attackers/playmakers. Pjanic plays as AM. Wilshere plays as AM/LW for Arsenal when they aren't short in midfield. Kroos played as AM for Levekusen and still practically plays in the AM role for Bayern. Strootman is an attacking CM. **And once again you've convinently left out Oscar and Barkley to suit your argument.** All playmakers/attackers. So no, not really different.

&gt;What the hell is your problem? When have I said he doesn't have potential to be better or can't improve? If we are discussing his performance in the PL last season the fact that it was his first season here shouldn't mean that we change the value of his performances, he played the way he did.

Except I'm not talking about potential or ability to improve. You're making him out to be a player who hasn't performed when in fact his attacking freedom was severely impaired due to the instructions he was given by the coach. When he has had the freedom to attack he has performed admirably. I've provided enough proof of that. Go watch the Stroke match in which he was center of our attack. We won that game 3-0 without Hazard.

&gt;Holy shit man, you can't be serious. Good lord, that stat is nothing. Hazard was on a totally different level than Willian this season performance wise, how can you not understand this??
Hazard &gt; Willian In almost every category, how can you even make this an argument?

What the hell? Can you not read? I have never said he was better than Hazard. But that he **CAN BE.** Fucking mind boggling.

&gt;You know what your right. What the hell was I thinking, basing my thoughts on players off of the games I watched. I should be more like you, I should just stop watching matches and head over to whoscored.com and opta to get my dose of statistics.
According to your wonderful statistics Max Kruse seems to be better than Mario Goetze, Robben, Julian Draxler and Isco. Maybe all the top teams in the world seem to be wrong in having much more interest in the other players. I mean Kruse is statistically the best player out of all of them...maybe you should give Bayern and Real Madrid a call and explain to them why they obviously have no clue what they are doing...

Why would I have a problem with you basing your thoughts on the games you've watched? What I have a problem with is you trying your best to convince everyone else Willian is shit and basically hating on a player who has performed amazingly for us **in only his first season in the EPL.** You're literally everywhere trying to claim Willian has played like shit. I'll tell you what, you replace Willian with Schurrle in the game at the Etihad, or the game vs UTD or the Stoke match and tell me if you think Schurrle would have played as well.

To be clear,remarking on this as a serious study is - when treating it with a gravity it does not deserve in any way, shape or form - utterly laughable. The author commits so many fallacies, obfuscation of statistics and general handwaving that it is very difficult to consider this seriously. If you really want a study on it, look for one from a reputable institution instead of some guy on the internet who selectively cites his statistics and doesnt give a reference for them, but relies on a fucking trawl of newspaper articles (which is not going to accurate).

TLDR: Just because any fucking guy can wear a suit and be a talking head on TV does not mean he is either right or justified.

EDIT: Some fantastic quotes;

&gt;We are very grateful to Peter McLoughlin for the hundreds of hours he has devoted to this work. His selfless dedication is reflected in the quality of the research and writing.

It certainly is reflected allright.

&gt;Given the way in which this debate has been framed, we cannot help but make much reference to “race” and to distinctions such as “white”, “black”, “Asian”, etc. **Let us state clearly from the outset: it is our opinion that the concept of “race” is a concept with no biological foundation. And the social signiﬁcance of this destructive concept is maintained principally by the left-wing racism industry.**

&gt;There may even be Muslim communities where there are no grooming gangs operating.

Way to remain objective, there, champ!

If you remember when Sam Fox started topless modelling she was [just 16](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Fox#Glamour_modelling).  It was legal back then, with parental consent, now you can't do adult modelling until you're 18. There was [Emma Ridley](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1357809/Emma-Ridley-Champagne-cocaine-original-Wild-Child-God.html) marrying Robert Pereno when she was 15, she was on the party scene since 13. Tamara Beckwith also partying in her early teens, dropping out of Cheltenham Ladies College when she got [pregnant at 16](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1373468/Tamara-Beckwiths-daughter-Anouska-My-mother-It-Girl-cared-parties-me.html). There was Bill Wyman (47) and Mandy Smith (13). Amanda de Cadenet who was around 16 (possibly below) when she was dancing at nightclubs with popstars.  Even Helen Benoist (16) and Peter Stringfellow (58) happened in the early 90s and didn't cause huge moral outrage. 

I'm not saying any of this was right, but it was pretty mainstream and accepted *at the time*.  I suspect it wouldn't be now.

None of this need change following Brexit though. We control our currency, will have relatively free movement (much as we did before with very few European countries requiring a visa for British passport holders) and will still be a member of any trade deals that we do not depart along with the EU.

&gt; The money we would save not paying into eu dues, we would end up spending anyway in competing with the EU.

Except we are a net contributor to the EU, making other states more competitive at our expense. Besides, there is a very compelling argument that we should be free to decide what we spend our money on.

&gt; If we stopped spending the vast amounts of foreign aid, and policing wars abroad - we'd equally save a huge chunk, as well as some lives.

Not sure I agree with that. UK foreign aid spending brings a great deal of stability to the world, helping to reduce and minimise conflict. Similarly our military interventions have been aimed at preventing increased risk to loss of (British) life and despite their relative unpopularity do seem to have moved conflict theatres away from the UK.

How can we have a sane debate when people are presenting innaccurate ""facts"" as the orignal commenter made (that effectively there is no net migration to the UK). This is untrue. Even the official statistics are on the conservative (little ""c"") side by nature. 

We are talking about 200k people net per year (at a minimum) and 200k net people who tend to have higher fertility rates than native population in the UKs case. In reality it is probably much more. 

Are there more pressing global issues, yes (what does that have to do with this discussion?).

My issue is that I actually like British culture and values, and I see that disappearing quite rapidly in many areas unfortunately. Many of the immigrants arriving bring little of value to the UK economy , if we are talking benefiting the UK we would have higher standards on those arriving in the shape of education and expectations on assimilation, much like the US model of immigration. Right now we have massive ghettos in the UK which is not going to be good for anyone.

&gt; 4\. Weaken the European Project and Strengthen the Transatlantic Alliance

&gt; A robust transatlantic alliance remains crucial to U.S. strategic interests, as the ongoing NATO-led operation in Afghanistan continues to demonstrate. At the heart of the NATO alliance, the Anglo–American Special Relationship—Washington’s most important bilateral partnership—is vital. In marked contrast, the European Project, or the process of “ever-closer union” in Europe, is weakening transatlantic ties while undermining economic freedom and prosperity in Europe. The U.S. needs to recognize that support for European integration is no longer in its interests or those of the nations of Europe.

&gt; As public disillusionment mounts across the European Union, Washington should support the principles of self-determination and economic liberty in Europe while taking a strong stand against the development of a European Union defense identity. A Europe of independent nation-states would best advance U.S. interests in Europe, a strong and enduring transatlantic alliance, and democracy inside Europe.

&gt; Washington should be cautious about the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which could well lead to increased regulation and the importation of the EU’s managed market into the U.S. A transatlantic agreement that does not empower consumers and open market opportunities for entrepreneurs would be a bad deal for everyone, especially the U.S.[3]

But I guess my point is that Britain could also choose not to join EU sanctions, or could choose to withdraw its support from an existing sanction at any time without the agreement of other member states, which obviously reduces the power of any EU sanction.

Thus a country under EU and British sanctions could lobby the shit out of the UK to drop the sanction, which would cause another UK/EU rift.

To take your example, Steve Clarke would be awful for the overall performance of this Liverpool team, because the way he sets sides up to defend - narrow and compact, deep defensive line, 2 banks of four off the ball rather than pressing - goes completely against what Rodgers wants - high defensive line, fullbacks pushing up and DM dropping back to create a back 3, midfield pressing.

If you brought in Steve Clarke and got the team to defend his way, we'd be much less effective on the counter-attack because our players would all be starting from deeper positions. We'd also score fewer goals because we wouldn't press high up the pitch, forcing opponents into mistakes in dangerous areas. We'd also lack width because our fullbacks wouldn't be getting forward as much. We'd be wasting the energy of the likes of Henderson and Lallana and the attacking tendencies of Enrique and (when he's in form) Jonhson. 

Keep in mind that Rodgers' style of play is ambitious as fuck - there's a reason not every team is trying to play like we are, because it requires top quality players all through the team. We don't have top quality players at the back - defenders that are good in every aspect of defending, and therefore never exposed one on one no matter what sort of striker they're up against. Sakho looks better at the World Cup because he's not being asked to do as much individually as he is at Liverpool; but he's got the right blend of all-round attributes to be a success for us with the right CB partner.

Except... it isn't a cornerstone of our constitution. To the extent that there is a limit on the monarch in our constitution, it is that she doesn't exercise the personal legal powers she has (in her capacity as monarch) in a personal way, but only on advice of her government.

This then leads to the suggestion that the monarch should not openly express political opinions, as that could expose the illusion that she has legal powers (for example, if she came out against a bill and yet still gave it royal assent - on the advice of the government). She is, however, free to have political opinions and express them (just, ideally, in private).

But that isn't really anything to do with Prince Charles. Other than that he might be the monarch some day, so should perhaps keep his lobbying private.

Our attack on the other hand has awful depth. Last season I'd rather have played Sterling with a broken leg and punctured lungs than anyone off our bench. If we hadn't scored before 60 minutes we looked doomed. Better attacking cover will also mean that our defense gets better since we'll be able to put on players that can keep our high pressing game up. 

Our whole team was dropping deep after 60 minutes last season because we had no threats left after keeping a high pressing game. Everyone was exhausted by then. We never looked in control once our midfield and our attackers had lost the press. This may solve a lot of or problems defensively. Mind you I still think we need someone in the Thiago Silva mold (a calm leadertype who's never out of position) and new fullbacks. I just don't think they are the most urgent positions to strengthen.

Again, the monarch is allowed to have political opinions, and to express them. What she isn't allowed to do (by convention - probably not enforceable by law) is to exercise her personal legal powers as monarch in any personal way.

true,cubone23,null,null,"&gt; Free movement would likely return to a similar status quo to pre-EU levels with no visa requirements for Brits to visit most EU countries but residency visas needed for those wanting to live abroad on a more permanent basis. This is hardly a major inconvenience.

I disagree strongly. As UK citizen and long term traveller, I cannot express how much more difficult it is to live and work in places like the USA and Canada than in Europe. Building relationships and putting down roots in a country you can only be certain of being able to stay in for a year can be very stressful. Applying for the VISAs themselves is expensive and time consuming. The lives of 1.8 million UK citizens would face drastic upheaval.

Don't forget that [EU migrants in the UK are almost exactly balanced out by UK migrants in the EU.](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5cd640f6-9025-11e3-a776-00144feab7de.html#axzz361uJ4GtD) Assuming that everybody returned to their home countries (unlikely, but that seems to be the motivation here), there would be no reduction in competition for jobs, and likely an increased strain on welfare as people struggle to rebuild their lives at home.

In summary:

In order to conduct a stop and search, an officer needs to demonstrate reasonable suspicion that you were in some way thought to have been implicated in a criminal offence. 

The power of arrest under section 24 of PACE requires two elements:

First, that you have committed an offence, or are suspected of committing one.

AND (And this is the one that most officers tend to forget)

Reasonable BELIEF that your arrest is NECESSARY

Use of force

Everyone in the UK is entitled to use reasonable physical force in certain situations, such as self defence

This also includes police officers, who, under various pieces of legislation are entitled to use force in order to prevent crime etc, but again on the basis that only the minimum force required is used. This can also include pre emptive uses of force, to prevent themselves being assaulted. 

Application of handcuffs is a use of force, and police are required to justify this as well.

Also, local environmental aspects like not creating areas that become a breeding ground for vermin, or creating a parking problem for the local community.

In the ~5 years I've been renting the property, I saw returns going down, both because rental prices went slightly down (I was stupid enough to keep the place stubbornly empty for two months before I gave up) but a lot more so because property prices rose so much. If we'll take property value into account (and deduct inflation and other overhead), I'm pretty sure the number will be significantly higher than 4.5%, though I didn't do the math recently (I probably should).

My understanding is that rental returns in London and even the UK overall saw a general downward trend over the past five years (rental prices didn't change enough to catch up with property prices spiking like mad); I don't think our landlord is making much more than 3% on the flat we currently live in, for example.

&gt; What the hell? Can you not read? I have never said he was better than Hazard. But that he CAN BE.

So let me get this straight for the record, based off of his performances last season you think he can be better than Hazard?

&gt; What I have a problem with is you trying your best to convince everyone else Willian is shit

You see that is your problem, you are blinded by your love for Willian that you cannot understand I am not trying to tell people he is shit. All I am saying is that he is *not* perfect and has some serious decision making problems that have been evident all throughout the season and of course a huge lack of goals and/or assists. Not once have I said he is shit, you have made it seem like it.

The rest of the time was spent in the desert fossil hunting after my supervisor drove all the way down and met us in Marakech. I can recommend the Majorelle hotel for a cheap night or two, but it doesn't have a pool and it's probably not good for a week fancy holiday. I did stay at the universities 'Club' for a couple of nights which was very nice, had a pool and peacocks roaming around but you have to be signed in by a member of the university which we only got because my supervisor broke down in Casablanca and we needed an extra couple of nights in Marakech so he phoned a friend to pick us up and find us somewhere to stay, and he chose there.

The one thing I'd say about Morocco is that the touristy places are **very** touristy- the food is more western (compared to what you'll get in the smaller towns), the entertainment is a bit fake (the dancing and music you'll see in big hotels/restaurants isn't Moroccan at all apparently) and any fossil shops will usually have many fakes, composites (real fossils artificially glued together to get a higher price) and fake rocks/geodes.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;Your argument was Willian's stats are poor for an attacker/playmaker. They are all attackers/playmakers. Comparing Willian to Strootman, Pjanic or Kroos is like comparing Willian to Xavi...they do not play the same role. I don't know how much I can repeat this to you.

Again you are convinently ignoring Oscar, Wilshere and Barkley examples. But since you're being a prick about this, I'll explain it to you. Pjanic is exactly like Fabregas. Not Xavi. Kroos is exactly the same, but now plays in a deeper role for Bayern because they don't use a formation with a CAM. Kroos played as ACM for Leverkusen and that's where he shone in Bayern's youth academy. In fact, here's an excerpt from wikipedia: ""He has been praised by journalists[4] and former professionals[5] as a player with all the qualities for the role of an attacking midfielder"". For its sources go to his wiki page.
So yes, I can compare them to Willian because he is an attacking-mid too.

&gt;So let me get this straight for the record, based off of his performances last season you think he can be better than Hazard?

Yes. And not just based off last season, but also based off his performances for Shakhtar.

&gt;You see that is your problem, you are blinded by your love for Willian that you cannot understand I am not trying to tell people he is shit. All I am saying is that he is not perfect and has some serious decision making problems that have been evident all throughout the season and of course a huge lack of goals and/or assists. Not once have I said he is shit, you have made it seem like it. And then you basically constructed an argument which makes him seem like the perfect player/playmaker, which we all know is far from the case.

Blinded by my love for Willian? I don't hold any sort of personal affection for him, other than supporting him because he is a Chelsea player. And no shit he's not perfect. If he was he'd be winning WPOTY steady. But that's not what you've been doing. You've been claiming everywhere that he lacks quality and that the proof of that is a lack of goals/assists, which is a bullshit claim. You have not said ""he is shit"", but every single post of yours implies it. That's my problem.

Also, no where have I claimed he is the perfect playmaker, only that he can be if he is given the chance and under the right guidance. He is still only 25/26 and in only his first season in a new country.",0,1404051789,null,0,false,0,cik17sc,t3_29c9v4,t1_cik17sc,t1_cik0mav,null,1434458232,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I wanted David Tennant to be the Doctor...more accurately, he *was* the Doctor and this Matt Smith guy was an imposter with delicate eyebrows.

By the same token, though, once I'd finished Matt's run, I was hesitant to watch Season 1. I thought, ""There's no way I'll like this guy."" (Didn't help that I can't stand stupid Rose.) I decided to give it a shot, and after 2 episodes, he's fine. He's not, like, ZOMG!! or anything, but he'll do. And really, it's Doctor Who, so that makes me happy. 

As for Capaldi, I think I'm looking forward to him because he just looks so interesting, even in stills. I love the way they've costumed him.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"I did. If he had done well in that position he would have remained there even after Raul's departure, but he didn't. Schalke found their midfield to be a little too light even when deploying a destroyer alongside Holtby. His energy is obviously not a concern, but his positional discipline and his tackling (while good for a #10) is a little suspect when playing as a CM. For Schalke it was one of those things where they had just picked up this promising talent and he needed to play. It's not that he was terrible. He wasn't. It's just as I said, the midfield was a little lightweight and lacked a certain punch. However, when presented with a better opportunity Schalke returned to fielding two destroyers instead of just one partnered with Holtby. I watched many Schalke matches that season as I've been following the Bundesliga for a long time. The article is vague about it, but the drop off in form from Holtby as a #10 at Mainz to being deployed as a CM at Schalke was significant for me and the fact that he rebounded so positively once he returned to the #10 role was a clear indication of where he's best deployed.

 I know Spurs are traditionally a much more attacking side than Schalke, but that feebleness that Schalke experienced in the spine of their team worries me. I'd much rather see Bentaleb play alongside Sandro or Capoue. Why attempt to put a square peg (Holtby) into a round hole when we already have a promising and young round peg (Bentaleb)? I'm a big fan of Holtby, but why should we put Bentaleb's development on hold when it seems clear to me he's ready. If we need to we can even field Sandro and Capoue as the central pairing. Both are destroyers and Capoue can pass the ball from the back as can Vlad and as can Vert. For me it all depends on what were trying to do and who we're playing.

3rd Arsenal - Offered some great matches over the years, and would probably be higher up if they ever won trophies consistently.

2nd Barca - Where to start. By far the most arrogant fans, and after that UEFAlona match where we could have had 3 or 4 penalties, I've never detested a team at such a level. How then could Barca be no. 2?

1st Liverpool - I don't consider Liverpool a team, more a plague. I grew up in the Mourinho/Benitez rivalry, and we had a lot of CL conflicts in that period. However, the largest thing I cannot get past is their fans. Constantly bringing up their history and presenting it as equal to modern day success, and they're love-in with the media (Gerrard).


On the other side, some teams I genuinely like:

Southampton: Always liked the way they produce young talent, its just a shame they can't hold onto them. They play great, attacking football.

Everton: Even moreso since Martinez took over, I've loved their style of play. Consistently overachieving with a comparably small budget.

Charlton: No specific reason, just the premier league felt a bit empty once they dropped out.

Fulham: Don't really consider them a 'great rival'. They always felt like a little harmless brother.",0,1404054916,null,0,false,0,cik25cq,t3_29dyc7,t1_cik25cq,t3_29dyc7,null,1434458849,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10

The comedy focuses on the camaraderie between the soldiers, situational comedy, bureaucracy, conflicts of interests and relationships, and is contrasted with the deadly situations the soldiers are required to defuse. A major plot arc revolves around a will-they-won't-they relationship between the Captain and the Padre. The series was filmed in South Africa. The name of the show refers to the unit's callsign. A second series began on 27 February 2014, consisting of six episodes.

That takes away many of the problems we have with sending healthy people for time consuming an expensive diagnostics at hospitals.

I was lucky. I went to my GP with a specific (but very unusual) presentation of leukaemia. It was really, really not the kind of thing that a GP would put 2+2 together on. But the GP knew something was up so referred me to a (non-oncology) specialist who pretty quickly narrowed it down, ordered good tests and a day later I found myself eating some chemotherapy. 

My GP was good - he knew that whatever was going on with me was a bit weird, and likely needed treatment outside the expertise of a GP practice. He could easily have fobbed me off, and although he didn't suspect cancer he still took appropriate action. I can imagine in other circumstances, a different GP might not have acted so quickly - but it's hard, it's a judgement call rather than a scoring sheet.

In effect, the minimal implementation of this already occurs - e.g. if a GP repeatedly failed to refer post menopausal women with vaginal bleeding under the 2 week rule for investigation of a gynecological cancer  (it is accepted practice that there are few, if any reasons not to refer someone under those circumstances) then they would be open to disciplinary action by the GMC the result of which would be in the public domain...

Perhaps on the second or third visit the GP ought to send off some blood tests and depending on the boys history they might actually end up sending off things like HIV and glandular fever first. On the third or fourth visit when the GP finally takes some bloods and it turns out to be lymphoma (a cancer) they aren't really to blame. It was just bad luck for both the doctor and the 18 year old boy... furthermore, missing lymphoma for a few weeks isn't necessarily the end of the world. On the other hand, sitting on something like the first example makes the chance of metastatic spread (beyond the point at which the cancer is treatable) much higher.

The danger with this is that it will trigger the most almighty rush on specialist referral services imaginable... and as Yellowbenzene knows, the queue for the MRI scanner isn't getting any shorter. Skittish GPs dumping marginal cases on hospital specialists and services that aren't in a position to cope might actually have the reverse of the desired effect - in which legitimate cancer referrals get lost in a sea of rubbish referrals... and end up with delayed or missed diagnosis as a result.

That's an actual rape culture. It's also where many of these grooming and Asian rape gangs come from.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"It's not just about cultural identity, it's the fact that a federalised Europe would represent a fundamental constitutional change that no British people or government has ever really been in favour of. The UK is a political union of 4 home nations who share close cultural, political and geographical ties. That is a very different proposition to a United Europe which would have 28+ members with hugely different cultures, economies and priorities. Quite apart from the hugely difficult tensions and conflicts that would natural arise from such a union (just see how happy the Greeks are with Germany after being bound together by the Euro), the sheer size of the project would almost certainly mean that UK citizens would find themselves with less democratic power than they enjoy now simply because the weight of their vote is now diluted and their parliament is more distant. The political culture of the EU is also a problem. It seems fairly clear based on recent history that the received wisdom in Europe is that private consensus is better than public debate and that the elites can be trusted to quietly agree and carry out what is best for the people. That may well work in Europe, but it is utterly foreign to the UK who have a healthy disregard for our politicians and a mistrust of backroom deals.

The fact is, if the EU continues to push for a United States of Europe without making any sensible arrangements for  those who don't want to join, they will be pushing the UK to the exit. I wouldn't mind so much if people had been explicitly consulted on whether they wanted a federal Europe and said ""yes"", but the evidence is that the question has never been clearly asked and that wherever it has been hinted at, European people are lukewarm on the prospect .

* the police were not welcome in that community in those days

* the community (""policing"" etc..) was run by the IRA. If someone was on drugs, criminal, creating ""bother"", maybe even just ""unliked"" etc... then people would go a Sinn Fein office or IRA members to ""get it sorted"". 

* the kids hated the ""Ra"" because of ""punishment"" beatings etc..

* no real police 


So the ""HOOD"" culture was born. Hated by the IRA, yet they done the stuff they learned from the IRA, in the areas where the IRA had made impossible for the police to police.


**edit, from a 1999 article** http://www.economist.com/node/184247


&gt;Sinn Fein, bolstered by 40% of the Catholic vote, smoothly explains IRA attacks as a “regrettable” consequence of their community's refusal to trust the 93% Protestant RUC. Community pressure, they say, forces the IRA to punish criminals.

&gt;But it is clear that IRA punishment beatings are not simply vigilante justice. Over the years some victims have been singled out because they criticise the IRA, some for nothing more than personal clashes with IRA members. During the first ceasefire of 1994-96, a series of IRA killings were claimed in the bogus name of “Direct Action Against Drugs”. Republican sources suggested later that DAAD had siphoned off anger and bloodlust while their leadership struggled to prolong the ceasefire. It is also true that the IRA does its best to preserve local antipathy to the RUC: when Donegal Celtic, a Catholic football team, was recently drawn to play against the RUC in a tournament, it was pressured to withdraw.

&gt;But there is a basis for the republican claim that punishment beatings enjoy some local support. A total of 9,500 stolen cars were recovered in west Belfast last year.

**Mobile Telecomms:** the UK has four major mobile networks - EE (also branded as Orange and T-Mobile), Vodafone, O2, and 3 (often styled as Three) - all of which enjoy good coverage in most urban areas. There's also a significant market of smaller companies buying bandwidth wholesale from the big four and selling their own branded products (but backed by one of the big four networks), such as Virgin, Tesco Mobile, and GiffGaff. Consider [CompareMobileDeals.com](http://www.comparemobilephonedeals.com/mobile-phones/SIM-Only/SIM-Card) to find the best deal for you, based on your expected usage.

**Terrestrial (Landline) Telecomms:** Virtually every property in the UK is served by a phone line provided by British Telecom (BT), who maintain the infrastructure that's in-turn used by a plethora of smaller companies (in a variety of different ways). Meanwhile, ""cable"" companies have laid their own fibre in some areas, although this is mostly limited to urban centres: if you're out in the sticks, you're not likely to get good coverage! Ignoring the specifics of the major technologies, your best starting point would be [thinkbroadband.com](http://www.thinkbroadband.com), which provides speed/coverage/price/etc. comparisons between the major players.

Most of the bigger terrestrial players offer bundles including landline phone, cable television, Internet, etc. Personally, my experience is that companies that provide all of these services in a bundle tend to be less-helpful when you invariably need to phone up about a problem with any one of them, and I keep them separate: but it's certainly true that there are cost-saving options if you ""bundle"".

**Shopping:** the UK has a well-developed supermarket culture, and you'll find that wherever you live you're not far from at least one, and probably several, large supermarkets. Tesco dominate the market, trailled by Asda, Sainsburys, and Morrisons (the balance varies regionally), but you'll also find a good number of stores from Co-Op, Waitrose (more-expensive), Aldi, Lidl (both very cheap so long as you don't mind finding the English name for things about fourth on the packaging), Iceland (mostly frozen food) etc. We're also well-supplied with smaller convenience stores, many of which are franchises to a chain (Spar, Happy Shopper, etc.). The supermarkets, and especially the large ones, typically offer the best-value for day-to-day grocery shopping.

Hope that gets you started (and perhaps inspires others to give more-specific recommendations).

One phone network that lots people will recommend is Giffgaff because for £10 you get 1GB, unlimited texts, 500 minutes per month or £12 for unlimited data and texts plus 250 minutes, but they run on O2 and in some parts of Hertfordshire (Potters Bar I'm looking at you) the signal is abysmal. 

Three do some cheap 1 month rolling and 12 month sim only contracts with unlimited data and 4G is included. But you might want to check coverage where you'll be living first on their websites, and Tesco mobile are cheap too.

Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three are the companies that run the mobile networks in the UK so when you check coverage check with their websites. As well as their own tariffs, there are a load of virtual networks who run over their networks with their own tariffs, and that's the likes of Giffgaff, Tesco Mobile, Virgin Mobile, TalkTalk mobile, Lebara and many more.

You can get some good comparisons here http://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/compare/sim_only_deals/ and Carphone Warehouse and Phones4U will sell you tariffs from most big networks.

For internet check TalkTalk, Plusnet, BT, Virgin Media, Sky, EE and a few others. Uswitch is good for this too. If you go with Virgin, EE or TalkTalk this lets you get better deals on their phone tariffs also and some firms combine internet with TV and a landline phone package. Remember that whatever the advertised price is on internet, line rental will almost always have to be added at around £15 per month. This is always on their adverts but is always a bit smaller than their headline rate. Fibre broadband is usually a bit more expensive than normal.

Supermarkets are Tesco, Sainsbury's, ASDA, Morrisons, Waitrose, M&amp;S Simply Food, Aldi and Lidl. They won't all be in the place where you're living. The first five of those plus Ocado and Iceland, offer online ordering and delivery or collection and you can often find £20 or £15 off your first shop with each of them.

Bigger branches of these stores sell so many different things. As well as groceries, if you find a Tesco Extra it'll sell furniture, electricals, they have their own bank, books, mobile phones, film subscriptions and so on.

I don't think you have Amazon in Australia to the extent we do over here? That's good for pretty much loads of stuff. For bricks and mortar stores you have department stores such as John Lewis and Debenhams and Marks and Spencer that sell most things, IKEA for cheap furniture. Find you're nearest retail park or shopping centre and there'll be shops there to fill your house with stuff and keep yourself clothed.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Let me tell you exactly how this will work.  

Companies are currently expected to provide 28 days leave (w/o mucking around with bank holidays for simplicity's sake), not including a 104 weedend days, but not including commission.  So 233 actual work days.

All companies will do is reduce commission strokes in line with the average commission they currently pay over 261 days to cover the extra 28 days they're now not actually earning commission.  There's no extra money coming into the company, and their commission strokes will already be geared with cost-benefit in mind.  

On the face of it the company pays the same, and the recipient receives the same (on average) if they take their full 28 days over the year.  

However there is another aspect to take into account.  The company is now obliged to pay out on a forecast, and the paid commission-leave may be above or below that forecast, or be based on a different business cycle.  They might be paying out commission-leave based on a good year when business is now slow.  Companies could actually see themselves losing money.

But again, just as companies will adjust the commission stroke to accommodate the 28 days leave, they'll also adjust it so they have a holding account, or insurance, for fluctuations in commission.  This too will also come out of the commission.  It's all very good if the average commission paid on vacation leave based on the previous year turns out to be less than the average of next i.e. commissioned sales go up on the year, but it's costs the company more if commissioned sales on average go down on the previous year.  Not only does the company now have less money coming in, they've also now got greater overheads.

There's a third dimension:  sales may be seasonal.  So anybody with a touch of nouse on commission will be booking their holidays when sales are typically worst. The company has to pay out on an average based on when sales/commissions are high at a time when sales/commissions are worst, making the discrepancy even greater.  They'll of course adjust for this a 3rd time and commission rates will go down again.

So in the spirit of Keynes companies will simply, in all reality, lower their commissions again on the days they do work to compensate for commission-paid leave, but also lower commission rates a second time to cover any potential future short falls.

---------

So we have two scenarios;  one is where the employer gets a higher commission stroke, is entitled to their basic paid salary and 28 days leave, but it is their own responsibility to save 10-15% of their commission for when they take their holidays.   The second scenario is the company takes responsibility, averages out the commission over a set period, reduces the commission accordingly, then reduces it again to cover potential additional liabilities.

**tl;dr?**  It means less take home money for the employee and adds more bureaucracy to the company.  The alternative is pay the commission 1:1 when it is earned, put the money in their hand and tell them it is their own responsibility when they spend or save it.  That way means added commission incentive and less bureaucracy.",0,1404059068,null,0,1404059582,0,cik3m1b,t3_29e2ac,t1_cik3m1b,t1_cik2ook,null,1434459798,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

America is such an untapped market (relative to the amount of dollars available, there are already a large number of fans who have picked allegiances) that making inroads here could help get the finances and prestige to attract and compete for the world's best players and lead to tremendous success.

Although the MLS is growing in popularity, I believe that a lot, if not most soccer enthusiasm will be directed towards the Premier League, for a variety of reasons. And with NBC doing an amazing job presenting it, ratings will only continue to rise. 

That said, I don't know if Everton are ""ideally placed"" more than other teams. Yes, Timmy Howard plays for Everton. But there's only a small percentage of people who are soccer fans looking for a BPL team to support who don't know that already. It'll drive fans to support Everton (as we've seen in this subreddit with all the new fans posts) but that alone won't drive them *en masse*, on say, Man U levels. 

Rather, Everton should be doing whatever it can to capitalize on this awareness by reinforcing it as much as possible. Roberto Martinez on ESPN helps. Everytime the graphic of his bio shows up that helps. Evertime Tirico makes an Everton joke, that helps. But the club should think bigger. Have preseason tours in the US every summer. Get the new Everton kit on the streets. Both on the backs of existing supporters, but also on the shelves of local soccer stores next to Man U and Arsenal jerseys. My father knows very little about soccer, but even he has heard of Liverpool and Manchester United. Everton need to get on that level. 

But the biggest way to do that? Invest in winning. Competing for titles gets attention more than anything else. Its how you get on Sportscenter, its how you get that nebulous name-recognition more than anything else. Tim Howard competing for 4th place doesn't get on Sportscenter. Tim Howard competing for a title gets its own feature. Roberto's graphic on ESPN right now ""led Everton to 5th place"", the budding American soccer fan does not know the significance of that. If the graphic read ""led Everton to Champions League spot"" or ""Premier League title"" that's something else. 

In addition to winning, keeping the stars created by winning will help too. When kids pick up FIFA for the first time they'll pick Everton because they want to play as Ross Barkley- just like when my generation started playing FIFA they picked Man U because they wanted to play as Rooney (in fact, I'd argue that few casual fans in Amerca under 25 know that Rooney ever wore an Everton jersey). 

I know the finances aren't the best. But man, if there was ever a time to make a gamble, this is yet.

true,ceelo_purple,eng-westmidlands,Brum,"Streaming children based on ability has a negative effect on the overall educational outcomes for that nation.

Let's leave IQ tests aside for a moment and look at something more basic, like age. Kids born at the start of the school year are older than their classmates and the younger the kids are, the more important that age difference becomes. The difference developmentally between 4 and 5 years old is massive. 

Now, in countries where these differences are allowed to shake out naturally over time, there's no negative effect on educational outcomes and the successful kids show an even distribution of birth months. So what happens if you take the brightest, most promising kids at that age and put them into a gifted programme? Then their peers with July and August birthdays will never catch up to them academically, because the developmental differences become magnified. Originally the only reason they were the smartest kid in their class was because they were the oldest kid in their class, but once you stream them it's not just age, but additional practice, individual teacher attention and the confidence of being in a gifted programme that lets them shoot ahead. Kids with autumn and winter birthdays who started out completely unexceptional are more likely to be accepted to university, because those early differences become magnified.^[1]

Okay, so we can see that using something as arbitrary as birth-month to separate kids leads to unfair results, but that's not the same as the Eleven Plus or some other IQ test, is it? Well, first of all IQ is not a good predictor of success. While in the early part of the 20th century many scientists (and in particular eugenicists^[2]) argued that intelligence was innate and a predictor of future success, the results never quite panned out that way because other factors were far more significant predictors of success including work ethic and creativity^[3] while social class and home life was the most significant factor of all.^[4] That's not to say that working class kids are doomed to fail, quite the opposite. It's that *we're failing those kids*when we focus our attention on ""the bright kids"" and ignore the evidence that kids from disadvantaged backgrounds can compete with them on an equal footing so long as they are provided with additional educational support.^[5]

I was a kid with a September birthday who grew up in a county that still has grammar schools. (At eleven I was in the position of choosing which of the two selective schools I'd been accepted to I'd prefer to attend.) So I think it's fair to say that I benefited massively from the system. That doesn't mean it's the best system for the country, though. At every stage of the educational process we artificially reduce the potential pool from which we can draw our ""best and brightest"" with an unseen cost to science, art, industry and the British economy.

In the UK a culture that normalizes or tolerates rape would be never be acceptable. Now that multiculturalism has been acknowledged as a failure it cannot protect rape cultures from the non-developed world from taking hold here, as we are seeing with the comments in this thread.

&gt; Things like rape when people are unconscious or too drunk to consent are common in university life

This is the second time you've used this to support your argument but this is where your argument fails as this is not common amongst students, nor is it normalised or tolerated. There is no ""lad"" culture that normalises or tolerates rape. It is a figment of feminist imagination as rape statistics and studies on rape, despite their shortcomings, reveal. Rape is illegal and rapists can and do receive heavy sentences consummate with the seriousness of the crime.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"But we're not talking about culture. We're talking about race.

&gt;I respectfully disagree that the **race** of the attackers makes no difference. For those of us interested in preventing this sort of thing from happening again there appears to be a discernible pattern, way out of proportion to their population, for ""**Asian**"" men (or whatever the PC code is these days for Muslims with cultures from the Indian subcontinent) to be involved in sex crimes against **white** girls to the extent it appears they they are targeting **white** girls. Now we do not know the **race** of the victim in this example but once the **race** of the perpetrators has been revealed it is reasonable to ask whether this incident reinforces or contradicts the pattern. If it does reinforce the pattern then in terms of preventing it from happening again the **race** of the perpetrators is relevant.

Your culture is part of your upbringing. One's race has no inherent connection with their upbringing. If you want this to be about culture (or upbringing) then why don't you use those words? You make one reference to culture in that entire comment, and yet 6 or 7 references to race. If you want to talk about where people come from and how the culture is, that's fine. Argue that the BBC should say ""a girl who was born and raced in the UK was raped by a group of men who were born and raced in Pakistan"" (or wherever they hail from) but not that the BBC should say ""a white British girl was raped by some people of Indian decent"" (no allusion to where they were brought up, or their culture). One harbours interests in socio-economic conditions and upbringing, the other provides a genetic and scientifically incorrect narrative. 

TL;DR: Talking about culture is fine. Talking about upbringing is fine. These things are legitimate causes of rape culture and rape, so should be halted. However, that is not what was being said in this thread. What was being said was about genetics. There is no value in knowing an individual's race and only leads individuals to believe in racial (incorrect) narratives.

If you want to look at some touristy places that aren't super-cheesy, then the Ben Youssef mosque is gorgeous art-wise, and the [photography museum](http://www.maisondelaphotographie.ma/) is quiet, engaging, and home to super-friendly hosts who will feed and water you like family friends.

If you don't know Arabic and only have time to learn one or two words:

LA: no.

SHUK-RAN: thank you

VELLI: expensive

* The notice of planning permission was put in a place where you would have to walk up a public driveway to see it. So nobody knew that it was happening before it was too late. I'm sure many of them wouldn't have minded that much, but it was the hiding that annoyed people. Complaints when the scheme was discovered did nothing.

* However, when the first busload of teenagers travelled down the narrow lane to the farm, a few residents physically blocked it from travelling any further.

I've never lived in London, so I'm not sure how common rhyming slang is amongst real Londoners, but you don't hear it very often in the rest of the country unless someone is trying to be funny or pretending to be a stereotypical cockney.

Rhyming slang supposed originates from the criminal underworld in East London having their own code, so they could discuss crimes openly without incriminating themselves. It basically substitutes a word with a well known phrases that rhymes with it, and sometime abbreviating the well known phrases so it no longer rhymes. Here's a dictionary of cockney rhyming sland: http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/

However, as you might have gathered, there are a lot more dialects in Britain than just cockney. Move 20 miles in any direction and you will find a new accent and vocabulary. The best you can do is watch TV shows on youtube or BBCiPlayer if you have a proxy and get an ear for it.

I watched more EPL this past season than ever before, but mainly as a casual fan of the sport, not a particular team.  After watching their play and doing quite a bit of research into their histories, two teams really drew my attention: Everton and Tottenham.  With some strong marketing and on-the-field success, I agree that Everton has a great shot to capture some loyal supporters for some of the same reasons I was drawn to Everton.

Some bullet points:

- Classy team, and classy play

- Strong recent American connections with Howard, Donovan, and McBride

- Always competitive, if not the most successful recently.

- Smaller/lesser-known/underdog of two teams in a large city.  The other teams I root for stateside are the NY Mets, NY Jets, NJ Devils, and Brooklyn Nets if that helps anyone.

- Last, but certainly not least, the fucking fans.  You guys and gals are great. Knowledgeable, supportive, and active.  I feel like I've found my friends and family across the pond!!

If ownership can capitalize on the name recognition of their current World Cup players, Everton could see a HUGE bump in American supporters, and hopefully find another strong revenue stream.

I knew Timmy was already there and when Landon went on his most recent loan, that's when I started to get interested. I mainly began watching to see Landon compete against European competition to see if he was capable (I think it's safe to say he should have stayed). And Those two -- Timmy and Landon -- are American heroes so if this club was good enough for them, it was good enough for me. 

Now I'm knee deep and love everything about the toffees. Were few and far between but there definitely are some of us over here (live in western NY).

Especially when Brits are in a very good position to migrate to a country where they wouldn't have to support so many elderly people with their paycheque.

A shrinking or stagnant population is the vicious cycle, because it means less and less workers paying to support more and more elderly people. That is unsustainable and everybody knows this. Why do you think politicians in many developed countries are trying to INCREASE birth rates? They're not doing it for the fun of it, that's for sure. Or is it perhaps a left wing plot of some kind?

You had mentioned the CL 2005 final, I'd recommend watching a few videos on the FA Cup 2006 final with West Ham. You will start constructing a mini shrine of Gerrard in your room and whisper his name three times every night before you go to bed. Having his name in the back of your first kit is quintessential to becoming a supporter of course.

Learn the history, traditions, and legends of the club. Some information can be found on the sidebar of this subreddit.

* Hillsborough Disaster
* Shankly, Paisley, Dalglish &amp; the golden era
* Keegan, Rush, Dalglish, Barnes, Fowler, Gerrard, Carragher, etc. the legends 
* Rivalries with Everton &amp; Manchester United
* You'll Never Walk Alone(learn it)

This is arguable the best time to start supporting this club. We have a talented young manager in Rodgers, young talented players in the academy and first team, we play highly attractive attacking football under Rodgers, and fucking Suarez the mad genius.

If you want to go on to higher education I would retake at least some of your GCSEs, specifically maths, science and English because a lot of unis and jobs require Cs in those subjects. I would talk to some colleges and schools in your area and find out if you can retake your GCSEs alongside doing a BTEC or Alevels. I went to school with quite a few people who failed important GCSEs like maths and English and the school we were at offered them the opportunity to retake these while taking their Alevels. Another option is to retake your GCSEs at a college and do your Alevels through Open University - it costs more so might not be suitable but their courses are pretty good and you should get a tutor to help teach you. 

Also, don't think of this as 'time wasted'. I totally flunked my Alevels (as did many people I know) and decided not to go to uni. Then at 20 I decided that I actually did want to get a degree - I got a graded a First in my first year *and* I have two years of work experience in my industry that none of the people on my degree have.

true,happlepaff,english,Stratford-Upon-Avon,"I hope he takes notice of this. For two reasons:

1. If we want to look at a heavily privatised health service, look no further than America. They have the best gear and amongst the best training, and yet, in the recent health care effectiveness survey, they ranked flat last. Both in terms of effectiveness and in terms of expense. I hope this won't happen to the NHS.

2. The ""brain drain"". I've heard a lot of concern about the alleged flux of UK doctors, trained at NHS expense, fleeing overseas. Whether or not this is a problem at the moment is moot: I'm a medical student and, whilst I can only speak anecdotally, I know that a hell of a lot of my colleagues (as in, all of the ones I have spoken to) fully intend to leave the country and practice overseas if the NHS fails. Prime target is Canada. I firmly include myself in this category.

A lot of people wonder what we can do to save the NHS. It's really not that hard:

1. Stop trying to privatise fucking everything. Look at PFI and take a lesson. Free market dynamics only work when there's a level playing field (and sometimes not even then). If the NHS has to compete against the private sector, the playing field isn't level, because private facilities can refuse to treat high-risk or complicated (read: expensive) cases. No such recourse exists for the NHS.

2. Repeal the HSCA. See above. Almost nobody in the healthcare profession thinks this was a good idea. It's fragmented healthcare services and threatens to completely balls up everything.

3. Stop slashing mental health. Look, I get it: it's easy to see when someone is wandering around with leprosy or a missing foot: it's much harder to see when someone is depressed just by looking at them. From a PR perspective, slashing mental health budgets is a victimless crime. Except that mental health is also very, very cheap in terms of cost-effectiveness. Poor mental health is correlated with poor physical health. In reducing mental health aid, all we do is store up a ticking time bomb of physical maladies to lumber on the (already overstretched) physiological healthcare systems. Did you know that Birmingham City Council has reduced mental health spending massively? ""But happlepaff, what does 'massively' even mean?"" I hear you cry. **94 fucking percent** is what massively means, in this case. 94%. Just think about that. Specifically, it's dropped from about £2.4 million to a little over £100,000.

4. Generally give the NHS some bloody money. [Here is that survey I mentioned.](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror). Notice something funny? That's right: the NHS is the second cheapest per capita. Right behind NZ, which ranks 7th overall. And yet the NHS ranks first in just about everything. Except healthy lives, which is interesting, but the point still stands. This neatly demonstrates the NHS to be an incredibly lean, mean and efficient organisation. So when we see 'efficiency savings', this is really akin to lopping off a runners leg to reduce their weight. 

When I qualify, I will take slashed pay, mad hours and stupid workloads until I start frothing at the mouth to preserve the system we have. But the fact is that I shouldn't have to. I should feel like the government is *on my fucking side*.

**Bonus fun fact:** the secretary of state for health used to have a duty to provide free-at-point-of-access, universal healthcare regardless of personal income (I can't remember the exact wording). Shortly after this government came to power, they voted to remove that duty.

The UK media has been unabashedly doing so for decades, and the political class that very well knows that business doesn't want out of the EU, suddenly finds it hard to control the demons they found so convenient before.

Worse, this has driven a lot of the continent to the point of not caring whether Britain remains in the EU. Public opinion in Camerons attempt to sideline Juncker (whom he couldn't prevent earlier because he decided to pull the Tories out of the European conservative party) on the continent was mostly ""good riddance"".

You can kill them with a firearm too, if you happen to be licensed to have one. However the force still has to be reasonable. For example, you can only shoot someone if they are threatening yourself or your property with violence and are an active threat. If you shoot someone while they are retreating, then you are an idiot.

1- Talk to your supervisor and confirm that this plan will work with him / her. It is unlikely that your supervisor knows how this hybrid-residency thing works but you need your supervisor's support whatever the process happens to be. 
2- Talk to the department (if they are competent) or the division and explain the situation (your actual residence time, the research waiver, your agreement with supervisor) and see what they say. 
3- Keep in mind that, if your program is anything like mine, you have a 'confirmation of status' project to submit in the 3rd year (normally the 2nd term) which works much like the transfer of status project but will require attendance at a 'defense', probably in person (and probably not in the term you submit in, which is a pain). 

Odds are that the meaning of the GSO.8 dispensation will decide the issue. I would not want to assume that it makes sense on the face of it, but the departmental admins. will tell you. And be very clear on the question you are asking as in 'I lived in Oxford for 3 terms, and did research away, for 3, under this form. Does this mean I have 6 terms residence or not?'

Unfortunately, we also live in quite an unhealthy country in terms of lifestyles. That is, by and large, people in the UK drink too much, are overweight and smoke too much. 

Obviously, improving public health is another duty of the NHS, but it's handled by a separate entity to the bulk of NHS services (by the various national 'Public Health X' organisations).

They are huge brands that require positive promotion. The problem is the risk of him doing it yet again, wich could end his career. Repeat offenses require higher punishment. In the end his future here all boils down to money. If the club gets a bid at 80m+ a transfer is more likely to happen now than it was three weeks ago.

I also anticipate being in 1:1 negotiations without having to get another 27 countries on side first, all with their own shopping lists and prerequisites, that tariffs between our traditional partners around the world be dropped altogether (and to even build some new bridges as Iceland and New Zealand have been able to do in the Orient).

That would require Scotland to secure an opt-out in its ascension negotiations. I personally see that as very possible and likely, because iScotland's only land border is with rUK. The question remains though, whether Scotland would end up conceding on other potential opt-outs it would like, in order to secure this.

&gt; There would be no need for border controls, except at airports.

Not necessarily, if rUK quits the EU and iScotland remains in it. It would depend on to what extent rUK retains bits of the EU.

One possible indicator is the extent of border control between Sweden and Norway, which has customs checks (because Sweden is EU and Norway is not) but not immigration checks (as both are Schengen).",0,1404077410,null,0,false,0,cikb97l,t3_29dq95,t1_cikb97l,t1_cikawwo,null,1434465053,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's very rare for English police to be armed, and I'm sure you already know about our strict gun laws. Personal self defence items like pepper spray or tasers are also not permitted for the public at all. 

I think what you need to bear in mind is that we see government very differently from US citizens. We *expect* the government to have a major hand in things - the Post Office (even though it's been sold off), the NHS, the National Rail, and in fact most major problems here are referred back to the government; i.e. ""Well, the government should do something about it."" 

There is much more expectation that the major political parties will manage what is going on in the country, and that smaller local governments will bumble along and bungle it up most of the time. That also links in to things like CCTV, which I imagine you as an American will file more on the 'intrusive' side of things than we do, and the whole NSA/GCHQ revelations, which as a whole went down without that much interest over here. No one was that shocked (or even that bothered) that the government is/was spying on personal communications here because, well, they're the government. 

So really, if you're looking for a place where you have the whole American idea of independent self preservation, you're not going to find it here. Our government is probably far more hands on in every day life than yours is. But as for aggressive gun happy policing, you'll get less of that over here too. It just depends which one is more important to you, I suppose.

&gt;The EFA inspection found a classroom culture which was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a ""madrassa curriculum"" and reported that ""posters were written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited. Posters were found in the classrooms encouraging children to begin lessons with a Muslim prayer, one saying: “If you do not pray, you are worse than a kafir”, and staff reported that loudspeakers were set up in the school to broadcast a call to prayer. The few pupils that elected to study a Christianity unit as part of the Religious Studies GCSE course had to ""teach themselves"", because the teacher focussed on Islamic studies which the majority were studying.[37][38]

&gt;Year 11 pupils about to sit their GCSEs at the school were instructed to partake in an Islamic fast, taking neither food nor drink, to place them in the right “spiritual frame of mind” for the exams. Additionally, students were expected to fast during the month of Ramadan. Some staff at the school expressed fear that neither eating nor drinking amid high temperatures during the 18 hours of daylight in the months of June and July would compromise pupils’ health and their ability to learning.[39]

&gt;The sexes were segregated in the classrooms and boys and girls suspected of being too friendly towards each other were disciplined. The Department for Education inspection found the seating arrangements “often with boys sitting towards the front of the class and girls at the back or around the sides”. The annual sports event for boys and girls was scheduled in different days.[39] Girls claimed to have been discriminated against and said some were sent home from a tennis tournament because their dress was too ""revealing"".[40]

&gt;Subjects such as Personal, Social and Health Education, Biology and Sex and Relationships Education were bowdlerised to conform with a conservative Islamic teaching. Pupils studying biology were not taught the section of the syllabus about Reproduction and the teacher stated when briefly outlining Evolution that ""this is not what we believe"".[41] A former staff member said that one teacher had handed out a worksheet stating that women “must obey their husbands,” and told his class that wives were forbidden from refusing their husbands sex.[38]

&gt;A former teacher at the school reported that the current head teacher, Monzoor Hussain, expressed “mind-blowing” anti-American views at school assemblies, describing the US as the “source of all evil in the world"".[6] In school assemblies, former staff alleged that a senior teacher frequently praised Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda recruiter that had been involved with at least three major terror attacks, and referred to non-Muslims as “kuffar”, an insulting term for infidel. The teacher also used school facilities to copy Osama bin Laden DVDs. External speakers were improperly vetted.[36] An extended Islamic assembly for its Year 10 and 11 pupils was arranged with Sheikh Shady al-Suleiman, an extremist preacher who has called on God to “destroy the enemies of Islam”, “give victory to all the Mujahideen all over the world” and to “prepare us for the jihad”.[42]

true,listyraesder,null,null,"Most British police officers are against being routinely armed. There is a minimal armed policing presence in most forces across the country (all highly trained marksmen). The exceptions are the British Nuclear Constabulary who guard nuclear power installations, policing of airports, and the Ministry of Defence police, while police in Northern Ireland have the option of carrying a sidearm due to the lack of a handgun ban there.

There is a certain militarisation in that the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism firearms unit (which is active across the UK) routinely trains with the SAS in hostage rescue and assault manoeuvres. But that is more to do with the SAS being the best, and allowing police access to the same skillset, besides the fact that the CT police are only used in narrow circumstances. All armed officers in Britain are required to do intensive re-training every six months at great cost, another barrier to militarising the police force.

Armed police are able to use their handgun sidearms on their own judgement, but use of long guns has to be cleared by the central command authority on a case-by-case basis.

A tactical firearms response unit (which handles day-to-day firearms work, as opposed to planned raids or major incidents) is called out for two main types of incident; those involving blades and those involving firearms. In the case of firearms the armed officers will go directly to a confrontational stance, but in the case of blades it is more normal that they will park a street or two away and allow non-armed officers to make the first contact and determine whether the blade is still in play or whether it has been discarded. This limits the escalation.

A major difference between UK and US police is that the US police are there to enforce the law, while British police aim to keep the peace.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"The key thing here is that many symptoms people present to their doctor with are of common illnesses which don't warrant immediate referral for further investigation, even if they are symptoms which *can* overlap with certain cancers.

For example, a woman going through the menopause might present to her GP with a history of hot flushes and heart palpitations.  The GP would be completely justified in telling that her to keep an eye on things and see them again if it gets worse or doesn't respond to whatever treatment they might suggest.  Now then, those symptoms can also be characteristic of carcinoid syndrome, a rare constellation of symptoms caused by a very uncommon tumour which secretes serotonin and has often spread around the body at the time of diagnosis.  Do we refer all peri-menopausal women with these symptoms to a surgeon with a view to imaging or blood test?  No, because the condition is very rare.  

The same reasoning could be applied to the tragic story in the article.  A woman in her sixties is reasonably likely to have piles, which are a much more common cause of rectal bleeding than anal cancer, which is commonest in young, gay men who are receptive partners in anal sex.  The patient may have had anal cancer *and* piles, which the doctor examining picked up and then thought they had found a cause for the bleeding.  It is frightening, because it would be so easy to miss something like this, even if you did take the correct history and examination at the time.

Neck node enlargement can be caused by cancer, but is most commonly due to infection.  If it doesn't go away then you would get sent for an ultrasound, and I suspect any GP worth their tongue depressor would arrange this.

I work in imaging, which sees a lot of business from the investigation of suspected cancer.  At the moment, the waiting lists for scans are long enough up and down the country, and there aren't enough doctors in my speciality to cope with the demand.  If this goes ahead, we will see a surge in defensive referrals from shit-scared GPs which will mean that people who *do* have a good picture of having cancer will potentially be scanned too late.",0,1404079188,null,0,false,0,cikc12v,t3_29e0ts,t1_cikc12v,t1_cikbdrg,null,1434465456,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I don't think anybody is going to be able to answer definitively, because the Companies Act is the longest Act in British Parliamentary history (so obviously nobody's actually read it). 

The Website says that it is counted 'businesses' and that the information comes directly from 'Companies House'. Companies House holds information and receives annual financial information from all private businesses except occasionally for unlimited liability companies. The true answer to the question is what constitutes a business, i.e. whether being self employed constitutes a business, and that answer is buried in the 2006 Act. However, the the article on self Employment and Sole Traders gives the impression that they are treated as a form of company or business and therefor will have to send their details to Companies House and therefor will be counted on the map shown in this thread. There's certainly going to be start ups included in the figures shown, but the figures are probably a lot more vague than it first seems, because things which aren't startups (at least as we normally think of them) are included.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;It's important we understand this if we're going to protect vulnerable people in the future from such men.

One approach which has been suggested, although it'd be very controversial and raise as many new problems as it solved, would be to offer a whistle-blowers' amnesty to paedophiles who could give hard evidence against high level paedophile rings in which they were involved.  The problems are obvious.

Real Madrid are preparing a raid on Liverpool for Raheem Sterling.

The Spanish giants have identified the teenage England winger as a future world star, but were planning to wait until next summer before making a move.

Sunday Mirror Sport understands, however, that the European champions are so concerned about the tendonitis knee problem that plagued Cristiano Ronaldo’s World Cup that they want to seal a deal for Sterling now.

The 19-year-old capped a sensational season with Liverpool by being one of England’s few outstanding players in Brazil.

He played in all three games for England as Roy Hodgson’s men bowed out at the group stages with just a single point.

But Sterling’s outstanding contribution against Italy has prompted Madrid to believe he is ready to handle a switch to the Bernabeu.

Madrid are ready to offer £25million-plus - despite still maintaining a strong interest in £70million-rated Liverpool bad boy Luis Suarez.

With Suarez’s future hanging precariously in the balance following another biting outrage which has seen him banned from all football for four months, Brendan Rodgers will be desperate to keep Sterling at Anfield.

And Liverpool are in a strong position to turn down any bids after qualifying for the Champions League. Sterling still has three years left on the £35,000-a-week contract he signed 18 months ago.

And, as revealed by Sunday Mirror Sport last month, Liverpool are any to discuss terms about a new deal that would catapult the Jamaica-born youngster beyond the £100,000-a-week mark.

But Madrid are already compiling a personal profile on Sterling and weighing up whether he will relish a move to Spain. They did the same before spending a world record £86m fee to recruit Gareth Bale from Tottenham last summer.

The impact the Wales international has had at the Bernabeu has encouraged the belief inside Real that signing top line, emerging Premier League stars can pay off for them.

Ronaldo is scheduled to undergo an operation to cure his tendonitis and rehabilitation after surgery could take months.

With Madrid also ready to listen to offers for Argentine winger Angel di Maria, they are in the market for top recruits as they aim for an 11th Champions League triumph and a tilt at recovering the La Liga title from local rivals Atletico Madrid.

Sterling arrived at Liverpool as a 15-year-old in a deal which saw the Reds hand QPR an initial £600,000 in a deal worth £5million.

England boss Hodgson admitted during the week that he would like to see more of his players move abroad to further their footballing education.

true,operatorhabit,,Downpatrick,"There's a load of sweet places in the Mournes to camp but it all depends on how far off the beaten track you want to go or how willing you and those in your party are to travel/walk. My favourite place to camp in all of the Mournes is on the summit of the mountain Doan (just above Loughshannagh and even further above the Silent Valley/Ben Crom Reservoirs). It is relatively easy to get to and grants you, in my opinion, the best panoramic views of both the mountains and beyond [(see here)](http://mountainviews.ie/summit/290/_serverdata/pix/picmtn_ct-00290-11.jpg).  However if that seems a bit too ambitious the Annalong Wood, both on the western side near the Carrick Little track and on the eastern side down near Dunnywater, are good shouts and firm favourites of mine. I'd also suggest the northern shores of Loughshannagh, probably my most frequented camping site and quite popular with other campers. 


All of these sites require a bit of a dander to get to but they're all accessible (or located just off) from very popular tracks and thoroughfares into the Mournes which in themselves are accessible from well-known car parks (eg Carrick Little carpark, Ott/Blue Quarry carpark etc). However if you aren't up for a bit of a trek then there's always the likes of Meelmore Lodge and The Rock amenity sites.


If you're going to venture into the Mournes though and are intent on having a bit of a swall please, please **PLEASE** clean the fuck up after yourselves. The amount of times I, along with others, have had to clean up campsites after scummy wankers have all but destroyed the place is beyond a joke. Leave no trace. 


If you need any other suggestions I'll be happy to give them to you.

In other countries such as the USA its more common to have a buyer rep and a seller rep who then do all the negotiations on behalf of their respective paying client.
  
I've been in the industry for just under 10 years and I set up on my own to try and NOT be a total bastard. I even tell clients from the start that I won't engage in morally or ethically questionable business practices on pain of termination of contracts without notice. I want my business to be known as a bastion of integrity and good practice, so it does stick in my throat to be tarred with the same brush as others in my industry, some of whom really are utter scum, but not all - there are good guys out there (I was and still am one of them!).
  
I was going to set up a free training/advice clinic for tenants and Landlords etc with sign posting to legal professionals or advisory bodies where appropriate but nobody seems interested; even though I come across such a huge amount of incorrect knowledge on a daily basis.

Society and culture of the time, in that area, created the ""hood"" culture. It's what happens when there is no real police presence and the ones being judge, jury and executioner did so at will, and attacked everyone who they deemed as unwelcome.

Of course the ""hoods"" were going to talk about the people who shot and beat them. You can't claim it's ""touting"" as they were not being disloyal or defectors of any sort. The ira was their enemy. How many were caught being hoods anyway. The police were not allowed to freely operate in those areas to obtain evidence etc...



The reason for people not cooperating with the real police was valid. So you can blame it on the way the RUC operated and the underlying society. But republicans and the ira played their part by kneecapping and beating whoever they wanted without a real trial or justice. The whole DAAD thing was also retarded. Geez, this country was really shitty and they were ""punishing"" people for taking drugs while.... the people doing the punishments were sitting in bars taking liquid drugs. The ira created ""hoods"". **That whole DAAD period created the most joyriders ever.**

true,IanCal,null,null,"&gt; Firstly with a stocks and shares ISA, if you allocate your full yearly isa allowance, can you trade the holdings in the account and have it remain tax sheltered regardless of how active you are in selling and buying? I assume so?

Yep. As long as it's all kept inside the ISA, it doesn't matter how much you buy/sell.

&gt; Secondly, if you have a certain amount in an isa allowance, for example I have quite a large amount in a fund isa with RBS, this isn't with a trading account, but can I sell some of that fund and switch the cash to a different provider and still have it be tax sheltered? 

Possibly. It sounds like you've already got a stocks and shares ISA but they've got very limited fund access. I'm not too sure though from the description. You can transfer from one S&amp;S ISA to another but BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THIS!  You **can't** just take money out and then put it into a new one, you have to do a transfer, which will be initiated through your new provider. It's all perfectly fine but if you take the money out you'll lose out on the allowance.

If it's a fund that's not available with your new provider you'll be able to sell everything and transfer cash, then buy the funds you want, otherwise you don't have to sell at all it's just the person controlling it changing.

Second of all, did I ever say he wasn't as good as Rose? This sub hates Danny Rose, I don't think he's horrible, but obviously Davies is an improvement there. The thing is, a slight improvement from Rose may not be enough because of what we give up in athleticism and the fact that honestly, Davies seems completely average. We need LBs like Holebas, Baines, Rodriguez, Filipe Luis, Siquiera, who can bomb up and down the flank and be both attacking and defensive. Especially if Eriksen is deployed on the wing. We lack a crossing option from the left which severely limits the complexity of our attacks - and from what I've seen of Davies not only is he mediocre going forward he is prone to being caught out while attacking and lacks the elite pace to make up for it.

Would I be mad if we bought him? No. Just slightly disappointed. The Davies transfer also seems not to be a ""steal"" to me, which is fine, but there's a reason that Swansea is negotiating with us.

&gt;

&gt;The __British Rail Class 142__ is a class of *[Pacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacer_(train\))* [diesel multiple units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_unit) used in the United Kingdom. 96 units were built by [BREL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREL) in [Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_Carriage_and_Wagon_Works) between 1985 and 1987. They were a development of the earlier [Class 141](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_141) which were introduced in 1984.

&gt;They were initially built for use on rural branch lines. However, as of September 2011 they are mainly used on busy commuter routes in the major cities in the north of England, with some also in use on local services around Cardiff and on Devon branch lines.

&gt;Under the [Disability Discrimination Act 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995) all public transport must be accessible by 2019 meaning Pacers will need to be withdrawn by that date unless they receive an extensive refurbishment. Porterbrook, who own the class 143s and class 144s, have proposed such a refurbishment,  while Angel Trains who own the class 142s do not see such a refurbishment as a viable option. The Long Term Passenger Rolling Stock Strategy for the Rail Industry indicates no new DMUs will be ordered in the next 10 years,  which means Pacers will need to be replaced by existing DMUs cascaded from newly electrified lines.

It wasn't the immigrants who evicted people and crashed the economy and ruined millions of lives across the modern world, it was a shitty corrupt capitalist system run by irresponsible bankers who crashed the economy... but in a hard time like this it easier to target immigrants and feel like it is their fault.

If someone was going to say ""this book will change your life"" if I did read it, it would be with about as much cynicism as I could possibly muster. Some people don't want to be told what they will enjoy and prefer to discover it for themselves. It's the reason I refused to watch firefly until years after the hype died down and why I don't watch or read the Games of Thrones series. 

You could present just about any book and it would resonate with one or two people, and the rest would find the content boring. Or chose a different style of book and it would resonate with a different couple of people. Personally I'd chose ""Belching Out the Devil: Global Adventures with Coca-Cola"" by Mark Thomas. Which is essentially a very long newspaper column about the evils of coca-cola written in a humorous way which made me stop buying and drinking the products. 

But I imagine most people would find having their favorite drink berated for the unethical treatment of factory workers offensive and just turn off to the idea. So the book wouldn't have any effect at all. 

1984 is one of the few books I can think of that might have impact across a wider group than most. A lot of popular music has influence from the book which the kids might have heard of also many popular video games have references to the book or even set in a very similar world as the book. Also many of the themes are pretty relevant to modern life modern day surveillance of people from the NSA and GCHQ via the internet being especially relevant.
