If your not free for the meetup, I'd be happy to meet another time.

Also, myself and my [colleages](http://www.bitcoin.is.it/) might consider using your leaflet as part of a two sided flyer. If we do, it would be good to discuss how we could reimburse you for your work :)

It isn't. Money rules there WAY more than it does here. If you're a politician there, companies lobby you openly to get something passed as law. Here, there are more rules surrounding it. You only have to look at the mess they have with internet/broadband to see how messed up the government is. Local governments suppress innovation because they are being bankrolled by companies with vested interests to keep the status quo.

Here, the government would be allowed to intervene in such a situation to grow innovation and keep things ticking over, it's why we have things like subsidies and competition rules, to stop one company becoming all powerful and gunning everyone else down. In the US that would be a no-no simply because of the label, government intervention.

I understand what you're saying about having a federal government and you might think that I'm going OTT with this but an American style federal government relies on pretty hard capitalism that a welfare state cannot co-operate with. You might say that's a good idea with all the crap this country gets with regards to benefits and people sponging off the state until you realise that the welfare state funds the NHS. Which I might add is being ruined through privatisation brought about by a tory government which is not a million miles away from US ideologies with regards to markets.

Swings and roundabouts I guess but the Americans most certainly have not got it solved with governments. They have far more problems than they care to admit to themselves, forget anyone else.

What we have now, works. Right up until we get the kind of hung parliament we had before where most of the country were being ruled by people they didn't vote for, since when has that been ethically right? Once we change the voting system, to something that actually provides representation according to the number of votes akin to the alternative voting system. Bureaucracy will exist no matter what system you have but you can at least let every vote count.

The problem isn't only the system per se, it's the goons who run it. Of course, it will never change because the people making the rules have the vested interest to keep a system which keeps them in a job and to an extent you can't blame them but that doesn't make it right.

In this youtube channel, called [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) you can find some handy videos on both alternative voting systems (and how they are fairer to everyone) and also the problems that America has with regards to finance and bankrolling it's nation through corporate interest.

I understand what you might be saying, all you want to do is copy the structure but leave all the rubbish behind. You still run into the problem that every county (or whatever division you use) essentially becomes it's own little country with different rules and different laws.

&gt;

&gt;The __Special Air Service__ or __SAS__ is a [regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment) of the [British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army) constituted on 31 May 1950.  It is part of the [United Kingdom Special Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Special_Forces) (UKSF) and has served as a model for the [special forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces) of many other countries all over the world.   __Special forces__, or __[special operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations) forces__, are [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military) units highly trained to perform unconventional, often high-risk missions.

&gt;The SAS together with the [Special Boat Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Boat_Service) (SBS), [Special Reconnaissance Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Reconnaissance_Regiment) (SRR), [Special Forces Support Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces_Support_Group) (SFSG), [18 (UKSF) Signal Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_(UKSF\)_Signal_Regiment) and the [Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Special_Forces_Aviation_Wing) form the UKSF under the command of the [Director Special Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_Special_Forces).

&gt;The SAS traces its origins to 1941 and the Second World War, and was reformed as part of the [Territorial Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom\)) in 1947, and named the [21st Battalion, SAS Regiment, (Artists Rifles)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Regiment_Special_Air_Service_(Artists\)). The [Regular Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army) 22 SAS later gained fame and recognition worldwide after successfully assaulting the Iranian Embassy in London and rescuing hostages during the 1980 [Iranian Embassy siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Embassy_siege), lifting the regiment from obscurity outside the military establishment.

I thought your point was that they shouldn't be paid through taxes, but instead privately through the individual? 

&gt;There is no net job creation.

But there is. The argument wasn't that the public sector creates more jobs than private, it's that it created jobs period. Which it does. Although while we're on the subject, you could argue that the public sector creates more, since the government is obligated to give as many people coverage as possible when it comes to things like emergency services / infrastructure. Not so with the private sector, who care for nothing except lining their own pockets.

Again, when it comes to your 'Everyone should pay for it themselves instead of through taxes' argument, I ask: What happens if I don't have the money for those things? 

Magically not having to pay tax won't mean squat to me in that situation, because I'd be too poor to pay most taxes anyway, and any money saved wouldn't go near paying what the private sector charges for healthcare.

Gerrard no longer has the lungs to run and Lucas isn't the best runner since his injury and while he'd hound opposition players he isn't as mobile as Henderson or Allen.

Both Lucas and SG need a runner playing next to them in order to press spaces they aren't going to get to, since they're not the quickest and pressing in those positions would take them out of position exposing the back four. BR tried to solve this by having Lucas be the one who's pressing. And while we were comfortable on the ball defensively the problem was that thanks to having both Lucas and SG on the pitch we had to reply on Coutihno in the final third to get any attacks going.

Which is why when Allen came in it became a bit better as we had another outlet in midfield instead of just Coutinho to get take the ball out of our half and into the oppositions half.

I guess my point is that Gerrard and Lucas just don't work together, Lucas isn't bad, he just doesn't offer anything offensively, which is greatly hindering his contribution to the team.

true,the_oncoming_storm,cnty-scotland,The Glorious Kingdom of Fife,"&gt; This is a very interesting analysis however it is just that - an analysis.

*Just* an analysis?  Which part do you disagree with? Bear in mind that my gripe with your comment is not your opinion on whether Scotland could make a success of it alone, but this:

&gt; I'm sick of subsiding...

and this:

&gt; The other nations are happy to bleed England dry and reap all the rewards whilst moaning about it - and not having to pay.

You're not subsidising Scotland, England isn't subsidising Scotland,  the other nations of the UK are not subsidising Scotland.  Scotland, for a long time, has been a net contributor to the UK treasury.

Additional spending (in all parts of the UK) involves *borrowing*, and Scotland's deficit mostly consists of servicing the interest on borrowing that was not spent in Scotland. 

This cannot be clearer, but let me repeat it, because the rest of your comment indicates that you have missed the point, **there is no subsidy**. It's a popular myth, but it's verifiably false. Go and look up the government revenue and expenditure figures if you don't believe me. 

Let me take a couple of your other points:

&gt; If the Scottish Universities aren't charging and aren't receiving funds from the UK Treasury who is funding that?

There is no extra money coming from the UK treasury to fund them. Funding comes from the Scottish block grant, its size governed by the Barnett formula. All these ""free"" things (tuition fees, prescriptions etc.) are just the result of different spending priorities by the Scottish government. The same policies could be realised in England if you voted in a political party that supported them. 

&gt; Scotland will have to set-up its own NHS and fund it despite not charging for anything. Where will that money come from?

Scotland has had its own independent health service since conception. As has England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. They've always been independent. Among other things we also have our own education and legal systems.

&gt; Why should one part of the same nation incur no medicine costs but the other part does? 

The joy of devolution. Remember, it's not that Scotland incurs ""no cost"", it's that we pay for it directly from the public purse. In England, the party incumbent at Westminster could choose to do the same thing, but instead chooses to spend that money on something else.

You are, of course, entitled to your opinion on how successful or otherwise an independent Scotland would be; however that's neither here nor there to the point I'm making, which is (one more time for good luck) that as part of the UK, Scotland receives no subsidy from the other UK nations.

I realise this comment probably comes across as a bit ratty, but I'm tired of people parroting this *received wisdom*  when a cursory glance at the UK's books, or basic knowledge of how devolution works would put it to bed once and for all.

They also therefore wish to distance themselves from black people whose ancestors were not slaves so they don't end up being put together in the same group.

Is that correct? It still makes no sense to me but I just want to ensure I understand what you're saying.  
e.g. for example to create an equivalent for Caucasians could I for example try to make a distinction between Caucasians that have a history of serfdom and those who have a history of nobility or merchant class?  
Would that be similar?  

I mainly don't understand because I've always seen ethnicity to be part of more ancient history where we all mostly lived apart and went off on our own divergent evolutionary paths. I find it odd that somebody would wish to create an ethnicity based on more recent past (last 200-300 years).

You seem to suggest that ""harsh"" treatment will change something and I can only assume that you are hinting towards reducing crime. It's been proven time and time again that harsh penalties do not act as a deterrent. One thing that's almost universally true about criminals is that *they believe they will not be caught*. It's pretty much a pre-requisite to crime in most cases except among a small number of literally crazy people. 

America is the textbook example of having a brutal penal system. Their recidivism rates are incredible, once someone is ""in the system"" they will almost always be in and out of it throughout their whole life.

I think firstly and probably most obviously is that a random guy on the internet has heard of SOAK. Most people who have spent any significant time in Oxford will have noticed detest, SOAK and others. I'm sure the infamy is a major part.

I think also lots of the people I met in that scene have the attitude of ""I hate everyone other than my select group of mates."" Not because they've done anything wrong but more because they see them as sheep or just midless drones. So tagging everywhere and having these sheep complain about the continual SOAK showing up everywhere is good in their eyes.

Also just to address the point about how beautiful oxford is. It definitely is, but as with any city there are large areas that aren't so nice but are clearly visible. I can't say for sure but I doubt they would tag any visible area of the old college buildings.

Go to noodle nation by Gloucester green and look towards the Red Lion. Up high and slightly to the right there is a massive SOAK tag. Same with down the end of Botley road under the fly-over.

As you said, we were defensively comfortable for most of the game (until we started to lose our heads after they got the goal.)

The reason that Cou was isolated today wasn't because of Lucas-SG being slow though -- it was a poor formation choice by BR 4-2-3-1, with Henderson pushed too wide, and also Soton compressing the ""10"" area where he operates. With our fullbacks pushing up, and soton packing the midfield, there was simply no room to play. 

Allen was put in to change the formation to 4-3-3, and with Cou going wide forward, our attacks got much better. (We eventually moved to a 442 diamond with Sterling as a #10 when Lambert replace Cou).

One problem for me is that the NHS have already saddled themselves with a lot of debt (via PPI), to keep things going in the short term.

Pilkington's transfer was kind of expected with his non-showing in pre-season games. He is probably one of the players who had a negative influence in the dressing room and needed to go if the team is expected to grow.

With regards to the Wolf, I would have liked to have seen him have a go in the Championship because I thought he would have grown a lot while playing in it and then been a real thread in the Prem once we get promoted.

No because I quite like the rest of the UK: Scotland and Wales (although I haven't been to NI). The soft-power cache that the UK has would be rather damaged if it were suddenly to splinter into 4 countries. I like being able to claim association with the Edinburgh Festival, the mountains of Snodownia and the Cairngorms, with Alexander Graham Bell and the many Scottish inventions, with celtic mythology and history in Wales, Scotland and Ireland and of course with Rob Brydon. Equally I hope people from elsewhere in the UK feel like they can claim association with which ever part of England they like the most and hopefully will come and visit it as part of their own country. 

However if Scotland decides it doesn't want to be part of that then frankly I don't really see the point of trying to hold together an association of 3 countries where 92% of the population live in 1 country and consequently where those countries MPs be further proportionally dominated by English MPs in parliament. I don't see any problem with England being independent - in fact I think it would do very well. It's per capita GDP is much higher than the other 3 countries and frankly I think it would retain the lion's share of the soft-power that the UK currently enjoys diplomatically and culturally. It might be nice to return to English history and English culture. We could have our own national anthem perhaps, we could make St Georges Day a holiday and talk seriously about English achievements without feeling a slight tinge of guilt for being Anglo-centric. I've been reading a book about Elizabeth 1st and it's interesting reading the *dramatis personæ* writing about England as a political entity with such nonchalance, something that would seem almost rude to me because the PC thing to do today, like the government or the BBC does, is to be concerned for the sensibilities of the other countries. It would be nice to be rid of that, not because I don't care but because it's silly that we have to pretend the union isn't lopsided when it clearly is and then have to face criticism for it (especially as a Londoner). Then again it's not clear that England wouldn't be lopsided but at least there would be less animosity to overcome before an adult discussion could be had about economic balance inside and outside of London. 

All in all it would be nice if we could just be quite and be friends but if that's not possible I'd be perfectly happy to be a part of an independent England.

English policies? Erm...destroy the devilish Papist threat wheree'er it be found, recapture Calais, Bombay and Hong Kong immediately, everyone gets a stately home in the countryside, send the Queen to America where she'd be much more appreciated and probably paid more and of course build castles on the Scottish and Welsh borders again.

&gt;In this book, Angell argued that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay. J.D.B. Miller writes: ""The 'Great Illusion' was that nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest.""[1] The economic interdependence between industrial countries meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved.

&gt;...

&gt;It is sometimes said that the outbreak of World War I disproved Angell's argument in The Great Illusion, but Angell had not maintained that a war was impossible, rather that it would be futile. Although some aspects of Angell's argument have dated, his discussion of economic interdependence ""was important and innovative.""

None of my points about Townsend's performances last season is untrue.  Beyond that, I did not make any general comments about Townsend overall.  Nor did I make any comments about previous seasons.

I will say that I rate Townsend's performance last season approximately how I rate Lennon's performance last season, as they each accomplished approximately the same results with their play.  The difference is that I think Townsend has more potential upside for the future.  In another thread, I've actually been defending Townsend, after a fashion.

I thought today was the best game I've seen from him recently. It still wasn't good enough, but considering he's now our 3rd choice LB it really wasn't that bad.

He made a few good runs forward, saved a goal on a diving tackle, and wasn't nearly as bad as he'd been in preseason. Glen still gave the ball away too often and too cheaply, but a good portion of our attack went down the left. You have to at least give him *some* credit for that. 

I think the days of him being a very good fullback are over, but he's hardly the worst fullback in the league. Move him back to his natural position and get him some confidence, and he'll be serviceable again.

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"Honestly, I think the solution is for BR to be willing to drop Gerrard from the team. He's still a fantastic player, and has a good deal left to give. But him and Lucas essentially need to play the same role for us, and it doesn't work when they play together. Fortunately, they both have different strengths and can fill different roles for the team, even playing the same position.

IMHO, we should consider starting Lucas when we need more defense - remember how much of a destroyer he was when KK was in charge? He was an absolute class DM, but he was asked to play defense and distribute from the back only. 

Gerrard should get the start more often than Lucas, but particularly in matches where we need more going forward. Lucas is woeful in the final 3rd, Gerrard is far more useful even at his age, and he's got the vision to pick a pass from anywhere. 

Give Lucas the start when we need to play more defensively and conservatively, and start Gerrard instead when we're looking to be more offensive minded. This has the bonus of also giving Stevie a rest - there's no way he should be asked to play every league and CL match at his age.

It was frustrating to see him lose possession but I prefer him trying to make things happen rather than to him being timid. The better decision making will come with time. Ultimately, I think Him and Aguero are the best striker pair option.

Dzeko was great but is limited in that he isn't a good dribbler or creator for himself. He was excellent in link-up play though, as he was in the opener last year against Newcastle. Couldn't ask for a much better performance from him. 

On Demi's yellow I was looking for where Kolarov was. IIRC it was a break but it wasn't one where you couldn't see it coming. I love Kolarov but I can't recall him ever racing back to try and defend a counter. He gets himself far enough up the pitch to get altitude sickness but doesn't have the legs to get back defensively. Demi is great when he has a fullback next to him but he doesn't have the pace to cover the left side on the counter. Mangala will be a definite improvement in that aspect. 

Aguerooooooooo looked better than he has in 6 months. I hope he can have a fit season. Silva was also great. I would like for Navas to start on the right next game though. Keeping width is very important imo. Nasri and Silva both go all over the pitch and can tend to clog the middle. 

Yaya had a great ball but looked so lethargic. He still has that feeling about him that he could flip a switch and singlehandedly create a goal but he doesn't seem to want to flip the switch. I don't know if it was because he isn't as confident in Fernando as he is in Fernandinho or what but it wasn't a great performance from him.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I was really impressed with Manquillo today. I felt his yellow card was rather harsh and he did really well to stop Tadic in the first half. In the second half Soton went straight after Johnson and more or less stopped even trying to play down our right flank. Between Clyne going in dry on Johnson repeatedly and Tadic drifting very far into the middle/left side to create we just lost control of the midfield (Lucas and Gerrard were barely keeping track of Ward-Prowse and Schneiderlin on their own... throw Tadic in too and it's chaos. Also Ward-Prowse looks ready to have a huge seasom) and conceded that first goal, then nearly came completely undone a few times. It may have looked like bad defending from Skrtel/Lovren a few times, but it was really more the midfield failing and leaving them out in the cold.  The Allen sub really saved our lives. I'm disappointed we didn't get to see Can play against Soton's very physical midfield in Wanyama and Scheiderlin as I think he'd have really balanced things out well for us.

I disliked the 4-2-3-1 for us today in general as I think playing with a dedicated CAM and leaving just 2 to do the main defending centrally really exposes us when one of the two is Gerrard (let alone Gerrard and Lucas together). When we moved to the diamond we immediately became more stable because we had 3 bodies recovering and defending the center of the park.

Doesn't need to when he gets played week in and week out... Even over Schurrle how can score more goals than him with a fraction of the game time..

&gt; Its also ironic for you to ask me not to play favourites given your obvious favouritism for Lukaku and dislike for Willian.

What? All I did for Lukaku was understand where he was as a player in his career and be able to understand his decisions to want to leave. Its not really favoritsm, unlike others here, including yourself who just bitched at him like an angry ex-girlfriend...

As far as Willian goes he is one of my favorite players in the squad..I just don't let my admiration towards him delude my judgments of his performances. He has been a shit playmaker and goalscorer for us, for the position he plays that is unacceptable and he **has** to improve.

You can't play the number 10 role and then not score or set up goals, I don't give a fuck how much you run around.

&gt;  Guess who Willian was making passes to all of last season. That's right. Fernando Torres. 

Fucking excuses again. Juan Mata finished as the **LEAGUE LEADER IN ASSISTS** with Torres as a striker. Willian couldn't even get a handful and he had Eto'o around as well.

&gt;Fernandinho also plays higher up than most DMs do. City try to play attacking football, which allows their entire system to play further up the pitch.

Umm I don't give a shit how attacking they are. Fernanindho plays as the furthest back defensive midfielder, he should never be getting more assists than a number 10/winger. This is common sense stuff which *you* should know.

true,jcmosch,logo,,"I agree on most areas, but I'd like to know what you think about some areas where I differ-- 

I liked Fernando's aggressiveness, but throwing himself into tackles like that will earn him a fair few reds throughout the season. Also, I worry that a team with better attackers will pass around him or draw him out of position easily as he tends to chase the ball. 

Clichy was clearly playing out of position. His crossing was worse than it is on the left side, and he didn't contribute attacking as much as Zabaleta would have. He's a stop-gap rather and I'd no doubt take a fit Sagna or Zaba over him there.

I also thought that until Silva scored, he was deadly quiet. He barely touched the ball, and I thought that Jovetic worked much harder to get onto the ball and create chances. He didn't convert - and lost the ball, but I'd take him working hard. Silva of course converts what he gets, but needs to be much more involved and allow Jovetic to push higher up.

Instead of splashing out a few million for one striker who can score lots of goals we've brought in a few players that can score goals between them, which is a much safer idea. Sharp himself can score a lot of goals and I think is a great replacement, but adding in Doukara and Ajose while having Smith, Poleon and *the others* we are looking pretty good. Plus it looks like we're going to bring in Antenucci who can score a decent amount too. 

Definitely one of the best signings of the window, I'd say pretty much all Championship clubs would love to have a player like Sharp so it's great to see someone choose us...

true,frankielax,null,null,"There is a ton of confusion about the terms of this loan.  According to Mundo Deportivo (and the concensus at our subreddit), these are the terms:

-Liverpool pays 2M Euros for a 2 year loan

-Atletico can cancel the loan after 1 year for 5M Euros

-At the end of 2 years, Liverpool can buy him for 15M Euros, but Atleti retains the right to refuse the deal.

This is obviously different from what other places are reporting.  I'm still not sure which is the most accurate, but I will say this as my personal opinion... the above scenario seems the most likely for a couple reasons.  I find it very very hard to believe that we would agree to sell him outright for a mere 5M Euros. Makes no sense for us to essentially have to buy our player back for 5M after a year while also giving you guys the option to buy him for basically the same price. Management still very much believes he is the future as both our RB's are 30 years old. Javier is also a born and raised Atletico fan so if he is promised minutes, he will want to stay. 

Now from Liverpool's perspective... I have no idea why we (Atleti) retain the right to refuse the 15M bid. I haven't heard of an option to buy from a loan that has included this clause before so I have no idea how accurate it is.  If Juanfran maintains his high level of play and Javi feels that he will play more at Liverpool for the foreseeable future, then no doubt he will sign with you permanently. However, it appears that Atleti has also done their best to protect their interest in him as a future player.  

I've taken the ""we'll see whatever happens a year from now"" approach and plan on just watching and enjoying him play well for Liverpool without worrying about his future. I'd love for him to come back home and be our RB for the next decade after this loan spell, but if it doesn't happen, then Liverpool is a great place to be and he will no doubt be a success.",0,1408338042,null,0,false,0,cjtc2yc,t3_2duaoo,t1_cjtc2yc,t3_2duaoo,null,1435295299,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

true,itspi89,null,null,"I really like watching training videos so this was really interesting. I agree with you about almost everything! I didn't watch Pelle too much during his previous stints so my knowledge of his tactics is isolated to his time with City. Overlapping runs are his bread and butter along with holding the ball until a defender is drawn and taking advantage of the space left behind. This seems pretty basic but it's not exactly what every team does. Often other teams prefer a quicker pass under the principle that the ball travels faster than the dribbler. The overlapping runs is one of the reasons I think Zabaleta is probably Pelle's favorite player. He's an absolute nuisance to defenders by overloading one side. Pair him with a speed merchant like Navas and you cover the weakness of overlapping runs (leaving a hole in the defense) because Navas (and Milner) does not mind tracking back. This doesn't work as well on the other side when Kolarov is featured though. He doesn't have the pace to make it back, and usually the player who's in front of him wont be effective in tracking back either (Nasri/Silva). This is why I like Clichy on that side despite his crossing might not be nearly as good as Kolarov's which adds another dimension to the attack. Against clever players like Neymar or Robben, Kolarov would be more of a liability. 

Another thing: Nasri's ball recycling is by design. When you have players such as Navas, Zabaleta, Silva, Yaya, and Aguero all having license and the responsibility to make penetrating runs, you need a player like Nasri to keep the ball. What will often happen after an unsuccessful overlapping run is that they end up swinging the ball across the pitch and it will end up at Samir's feet as they reorganize.  

&gt;Then at the 1 minute the same, this time with a long pass to the end of the pitch and then Pelle's shouts ""Centro atrás"" (Not sure how to translate it. Cross back?).

Sort of. In this context, he's telling the player to direct the cross to the edge of the box. 

I'm really excited about the possible emergence of Jovetic though. To compete in Champions league and the league, City really needs the depth up front for rotation considering Negredo and Kun's injuries last year. Further, Jovetic's creativity can be a massive asset in the case of an injury to Silva. City tends to stagnate when the Spaniard is not in the squad and I'm not entirely sure Yaya's occasional moments of brilliance is going to be enough when the competition got so much better than last year. 

EDIT: almost forgot something about Zabaleta. What's fun to notice is that teams started to assign their winger to track Zabaleta a certain distance to limit his touches on the ball. In response, what the boys do is drag the winger deep, lay off a pass to one of the central defenders who give it to one of the midfielders and then it comes right back to either Zabaleta or whoever is playing in front of him and then they start their attack again. Kind of funny watching the winger get frustrated as it happens multiple times during a match.

For which you can blame politicians and the press, who have done their utmost to demonise and even dehumanise those on benefits.

&gt; and then go ahead and invite themselves to his house. That's his private space, and what goes on there is really none of their business.

But it is. One of the responsibilities given to DWP staff, again by politicians, is to ensure that benefits are only claimed by those entitled to them. There are many ways they can use to check entitlement, and one of those is to confirm with their own eyes that the information the claimant has put on the form is correct.

&gt; I certainly wouldn't invite someone in who's treating me awfully.

As is your right. And they are in their right to mark that down on their forms as a suspcious failure to comply with a reasonable request, and sanction benefits as a result.

true,JimmothyTwinkletoes,null,null,"If Dzeko played like Jovetic today we would wonder where the urge to dribble past everyone came from. I agree that Jovetic wasn't great today, I just admire his tenacity and believe that he will improve with more playing time. He won't match Dzeko's skillset because he is a completely different type of forward than Dzeko. Dzeko is a target man whereas Jovetic is more of a second striker. 

I also think Jovetic matches up better with Aguero than Dzeko does, but thats just my opinion. When you are picking a starting-XI you have to chose the players which would best complement each other on the pitch rather than the most talented eleven. The only players who I think are too good to keep off the pitch right now are Yaya, Kompany, Silva, Aguero, and Zabaleta. The rest of the squad should be built around them. 

Since Aguero is such a ball dominant forward I think playing him with Dzeko could lead to the offense stalling as everyone would be looking to put the ball at Aguero's feet. Jovetic has the propensity to track back and get the ball around midfield or even further in and also tends to stay further back than Dzeko does. When Dzeko and Aguero are on the pitch at the same time Aguero has to drop deeper back and facilitate the passing more. I think Aguero is best when he can just go all out trying to get a goal.

IMO Jovetic would have benefitted immensely from Navas starting on the right too. Nasri and Silva can cause things to get clogged up in the middle at times due to them not being true wingers. We're best served playing one or the other with Navas opposite.",0,1408342820,null,0,false,0,cjtdmdf,t3_2dt6gl,t1_cjtdmdf,t1_cjtd11w,null,1435296250,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

Kidding. I agree with you but I don't think you just pass Lucas off unless you've got a replacement because of depth.

I'm hoping Brendão hasn't forgotten the lesson he learned early last season; Gerrard and Lucas play better when they're both not on as holding mids together.

That said I honestly think the lineup today was a rather pragmatic one off, and Migs bailed us out. 

I can only imagine that for some off reason Brendan decided that a 4-2-3-1 would be more suitable against new Soton as opposed to our 4-3-3 we played against Dortmund. Lucas and Gerrard have played alongside one another like this before, I would imagine that's the only thing that kept Can from starting.

We need to move beyond the belief that professional sport exists just to entertain us and generate revenue at a certain level. Yes it does this, but we also desperately need to get more people playing sport. Our NHS is crippled by inactivity-related illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and stroke. Sport and activity is the most cost-effective solution to this. Yet there is a massive drop in girls playing sport once they get to puberty because of pressure to 'look feminine', 'not act competitively' and (seriously) because 'sweating is seen as unattractive'. I can follow up with links to Sport England and the WSFF if you like. 

If young girls (or women) see this and think 'that looks amazing - I want to try that!', you might have found a future world champion. Or you simply might have started someone on a sporting habit for life - learning physical and social skills to see them through. 

The problem comes when you don't see women's sport, or disabled sport in the public eye. We should be proud that Scotland incorporated disabled events at the same time as non-disabled at the Commonwealth Games. If we don't see it, those groups aren't aware of the opportunities open to them. Even worse, companies won't see a financial value in sponsoring these events and that money won't trickle down to grassroots sport. And then there won't be any opportunities and we get into the mess we are in now with health care. 

Saying it isn't as good as men's is dumb for a lot of reasons but mostly it misses the point - those women will now spend their time doing interviews and visiting children's sports events to talk to gathered participants. Please don't squash their enthusiasm - they could be your children one day and you will definitely have to pay the price if they fall prey to a lifestyle of inactivity.

There are loads of jobs in London, I assume this is where you're moving, as London is powering our way out of recession. The UK technically has gone downhill but that's mainly due to the worldwide recession that hit us in the final years of the last government. The current government have been tasked with getting the economy to recover and obviously the tactics they've used have been quite unpopular in some quarters. They've cut back on welfare, public sector spending and public sector jobs whilst reforming education and the NHS with a view to make both more efficient. Efficiencies have resulted in job losses and pay freezes for nurses and teachers and generally all types of council workers which make up quite a large number of the employed in some towns and cities (I'm from Coventry and this is definitely the case here). Basically that's the gyst of people's gripes towards the current government.

true,bottomlines,null,null,"&gt;who in their right mind would attack the UK? Russia? China? Iran? and why? 

Who knows. Things can change pretty quickly. Nobody anticipated Putin making a land grab on Ukraine either. And the world has sat by and watched. So maybe Putin could start projecting further West since he learned that he can invade places and suffer zero consequence. Argentina too may decide Falklands 2.0. 

Maybe China's economy starts to slow and they fancy boosting things by seizing some disputed islands, or maybe just seizing Taiwan. Maybe North Korea decide a full on invasion of South Korea. 

As for the UK mainland - who knows. Maybe a resource war over oil or shipping lanes? Maybe the EU collapses and we start another war. 

&gt;As long as we have the US 

We may not always have them. They have presidential terms of only four years. We don't know that the guy in 4, 8, 12 etc years is going to be friendly to the UK. Blair and Bush had a creepy special relationship. Cameron and Obama less so. 

&gt;and others as allies we don't need defence because nobody would dare attack us anyway as long as we have their defence 

What a selfish and stupid point of view. 

Firstly, there's no guarantee they would defend us. If Russia decide they fancy some North Sea oil, would Italy and Germany and everybody else really get involved and fight/die on our behalf? I'm sceptical. 

Plus, as I already said, most of Europe don't hit NATO military spending targets anyway. So most of Europe is militarily weak and might not be able to defend us even if they wanted to. 

And finally, if everybody took that selfish view of relying on everybody else, we would all be pathetically weak. Compare that to Russia and China who are increasing military spending every year. 

&gt;Let the US funnel all their money into defence... their defence is our defence 

May not always be the case. And besides, why are you so comfortable depending on them and being indebted to them? They wouldn't provide military help for free out of the goodness of their hearts.

US banks plan ahead for UK exit from EU

By Martin Arnold and Sam Fleming


Wall Street banks are drawing up preliminary plans to move some London-based activities to Ireland to address concerns that the UK is drifting apart from the EU.

People familiar with Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley 
told the Financial Times that they considered Ireland a favourable location for some of their European business if they needed to move them out of the UK. One said he was already planning to move some activities to Ireland.

The people said their plans were in most cases still at very early stages. But they said the US banks had started preparing for the eurozone’s impending banking union that threatens to isolate Britain and, ultimately, for a possible UK exit from the EU.

“I’m frankly looking at moving some activities to Ireland,” said one senior UK-based manager at a Wall Street bank. “I think the Irish central bank and government would welcome this. It is not so much Brexit, more about legal entity optimisation.”

Most US and Asian banks have chosen to base their main European operations in the UK, giving them an automatic passport to carry out their services across all 28 countries in the EU.

But senior US banking executives said the UK was unlikely to be granted the same “passporting” rights if it left the EU – the so-called “Brexit” scenario. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on a renegotiated EU membership if his Conservative party wins next May’s election.


Executives at American banks in Europe are reluctant to speak publicly about the issue for fear of upsetting the UK regulators. One said: “I don’t think people are making enough of it – a lot of passported activities that cannot take place in London will not exist here any more.”

As the European Central Bank prepares to take charge of the biggest banks in the eurozone later this year, there are fears among some executives at US banks that this will drive a wedge between the UK and the rest of Europe’s financial system.

Britain is already challenging an ECB policy in the European Court of Justice that would force clearing houses handling euro-denominated transactions to decamp from London to the eurozone.

The UK hosts more than 250 foreign banks and last year it generated a financial services trade surplus of $71bn, about a third of which came from trade with the EU, according to TheCityUK, a financial lobby group.

Most observers assume that if the UK did leave the EU then Frankfurt or Paris would be the most likely alternative for US banks looking to shift parts of their European activities out of the UK.
But Ireland’s attractions for US banks include its low corporate tax rate, English speaking population, English-style legal system and eurozone membership. “Dublin is selling itself very hard at the moment,” said one banker.

Citigroup employs 2,500 people in Ireland in banking and markets, trade and treasury services and investor services. Bank of America and JPMorgan both have more than 500 staff in Ireland. All three have Irish banking licences that would allow them a passport into other EU countries if needed. Morgan Stanley has a hedge fund administration business in Dublin, but no Irish banking licence.

Barney Reynolds, a partner at the law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling, said: “The noises you hear from the American banks regarding Brexit are concerned ones. It is very complicated and expensive to move infrastructure like trading floors, but it is not impossible. If you are looking for one event that might trigger it, it is Brexit.

“London could essentially end up as an offshore financial centre. That would mean there was a need for a big onshore financial centre in Europe and the obvious candidates would be Frankfurt or Dublin.”

The trend in recent years has been in the other direction with the US banks having moved activities out of Ireland. BofA has recently moved most of its $600bn fixed income and derivatives book from Ireland to the UK mainly for tax reasons, but also at the request of regulators.

Goldman Sachs gave up its Irish banking licence last year when it sold its hedge fund administration business in the country. 
Goldman has looked at other EU locations for parts of its UK-based business, including Dublin, but for now it has decided against any move. JPMorgan has no plans to add to its Irish operations.
Foreign banks in London warned about the possible consequences of departure in a submission to the Treasury published last month.

The Association of Foreign Banks, whose members include BofA, Société Générale and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, said Britain should stay in the union given the volume of its business with the rest of the EU and the importance of influencing its rules.

“If Britain withdraws from Europe, then foreign banks may reassess their reasons for maintaining their business in Britain and may decide to continue their business elsewhere,” the group said.

true,spacetimebear,null,null,"Hello, i was in a very similar situation to you a few years ago: finished degree, moved back, signing in to the job centre and getting quite frankly completely useless advice. Which eventually ended up with me telling them to fuck off.

First, straight to the point: yes you can deny them access. However they will probably hold or stop your payments if you do this. 


And I know that you didnt directly ask for my advice in getting a job but here it is anyway. 1. If 'they' say your cv is awful they probably arent wrong, most if not all are. Im not sure whats on yours but writing a paragraph at the top about your degree, what you learnt and a bit about your dissertation would be very helpful, especially if applying for degree relevant jobs. 2. Lying on your cv is mostly bad(people lie about their degree all the time) but thats where the first paragrah comes in, make it good enough and it'll show that you know what youre talking about. Heres where lying is good though; make some of your interests relevant to the job. I.e if youre looking for an IT job put something about 'setting up networks for neighbours' 'building repairing pc's' 'flying drones' or whatever is relevant. 3. Cover letter means more than a CV. For any job that allows one, you should include one. Put in firstly why you want the job, secondly what you'd bring to the job and finally some crap about your work ethic 'highly organized and self-sufficient' try to go for more creative terms than what i just put as power words are rediculously annoying. 4. Remember that your CV and Cover Letter are only what gets you through the door to an interview. Make yourself stand out from the thousands of other boring fools.



When they say your degree means you dont need further training this is partially true. You will always need on the job training for whatever role you're new to. However just having a degree (at i assume a 2:1 or 1st) is basically having a sign that says 'i'm not an idiot, i can learn things' and you should treat it as such, maybe even moreso as simply finishing a degree (thats about 16-20 years of being in the education system) shows that you can see things through and thateven when times get tough you can finish what you started, which is a lot more than most people that want to tell you what to do have accomplished. I finished my degree in a random field that often gets mocked, I was left thinking i wasn't qualified or trained for anything and my degree was a waste of time. However after months of being knocked down by people 'older, wiser and more experienced' that actually know nothing about anything(as is apparently how most adults get through life) i realized, and you should too, that you are far more qualified to work in your chosen field(probably more qualified than a lot of people in other fields too) than many other people that will apply for the job.



On to getting a job. Dont know if you tried it but I spent a few days gathering details on any and every company linked to my field in the surrounding area, once I had a list I went through to check for any jobs or graduate programmes and applied to as many as possible, applied to most with a cover letter on top of my CV. Some didnt bother to respond(wouldnt want to work for those company's anyway now, I reply to every single work email i get, its not that hard, people are just lazy) some politely rejected and others gave me an interview.



Hope some or all of this was helpful. Good luck with finding a job!

Unfortunately, the quality of the sport relative to the men's equivalent is almost always inferior, and people will always want to watch the game with the best players, skills and technique. 

I'll admit I haven't watched any women's rugby, but I've watched a bit of women's football and I watch women's cricket quite often (it's often on Sky Sports), and I can tell you that there is absolutely no comparison between watching the men's test cricket and women's. Having spent so much time watching men's cricket, watching the women is really quite poor. The bowling is nowhere near as fast, fours and sixes are rarer, and the players...just aren't as good. We've been spoilt on a diet of watching sportsmen playing at world-class levels.

One could argue that if women's cricket received more funding and training opportunities then they could reach the standards that the men play at (in fact, once or twice [there have been murmurings of the best female players breaking into the men's side, though it is a county second XI](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/14/england-cricketer-sarah-taylor-mens-match)), but the cold reality of it all is that, for cricket at least, women aren't ever going to bowl at 90mph or hit six sixes in an over. And that's what people pay to see. 

I think the other problem is that women in general don't tend to be as interested in sport, and of those that are, a large percentage would still prefer to watch the men.

This is true, but the reason is because most workers are replaceable - most jobs aren't sufficiently difficult that you can't find someone to fill their boots within a few weeks. The few jobs where this isn't the case - C types, individual contributers (e.g. skilled software developers) haven't seen the same erosion of their income (in terms of share of company income).

So rather than 'top bosses' rewards being out of control, I would argue it's the opposite, basic level workers are in such oversupply that the price of labour has been driven down relative to what the company makes. FTSE100 companies have increased revenue and profits massively over those last 15 years, but the bottom of the labour pool hasn't really seen any of that because they aren't really individually valuable.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"Yeah, Kaboul was disastrous and we're lucky that Carlton Cole didn't understand the rules properly in the first 30 minutes. We definitely got off lucky - but there were so many promising moments in the game that I think we can build on. Salient points for me:

* For all the stick he got last season, Rose looked just a little bit better. He didn't close his man down enough and let Downing send in too many crosses, but he made important clearances and tackles in the game and was up and down the pitch a lot.
* Capoue as DM was working really well. He put in a good shift before he had to shift to CB where he wasn't awful either, but definitely not very good.
* Ade looked a little off the game, I think someone like Soldado would have worked better with sluggish players like Collins, but Ade did get that second yellow so he kind of redeemed himself just a little bit. However, I do feel that Soldado up there would have created a lot more.
* Eriksen was disappointing. I've never seen him misplace so many passes, give the ball away so much and be so ineffective in the final third. First game, we will ignore him. He is our glorious Dane.
* Lamela was a 6/10. He doesn't have that electric speed, tends to dally a little on the ball, but he didn't get very many clear chances on goal to take a nice shot. Eriksen playing better + Soldado around should unlock him.
* Bentaleb did nothing shocking, he doesn't deserve to be dropped from the squad.
* Lennon. Sigh. As much as I love his pace and his electric bursts and the tracking back he does at time, I think he needs Walker to complement him. The two of them down that side TOGETHER tend to work better. Lennon without Walker looks lost.
* Townsend was good when he came on. At least he got Adrian to move and work for his wages. Fairly sure that in an 11v11 game with 90 minutes, Townsend would have got a goal/assist.
* To Dier is to do. Would like to see him partner Vertonghen in defence although I'm not sure what that would mean for pace in the back line.

All said and done, it wasn't a terrible performance. We have to up our game next week before we face Liverpool.

* Increased unionisation. Plus: employees get a fairer deal and balances their bargaining power against the already unionised business leaders. Negative: you impact the UK's international competitiveness, impede business profits, deter foreign investment.
* Introduce basic income. Plus: employees are better able to both a) work for less money for less valuable work and b) choose not to work when the work isn't really paid well enough - it's a fairer system for both business and workers. Negative: national cost of developing, planning and implementing such a system could have a huge impact on a rocky economy.
* Cull the labour pool. Plus: Similar to what happened from the 90s to the 00s by putting everyone on the sick, artificially restricting the labour supply allows jobs to pay better and allows those who aren't really adding to the labour pool to opt out.

It's not that he doesn't believe in defensive mids, he (of course) explained his position wrong....what he was trying to say is that he doesn't want a specialized defensive destroyer in the midfield he wants a more rounded and versatile midfielder.

Regardless, i think he would have a hard run of it with Palace....he doesn't exactly organize a defensive unit and Palace don't have any dynamic creative players....so he would have the squad firing up field in the ""kick the ball around"" attack but with a completely unorganized defence.

Black pudding - Yes please. White pudding is also acceptable

Mushrooms - If done well and not soggy then yes. If they are a soppy mess then don't bother.

Hash browns - I don't care is this makes me a heretic. Good hash browns go really well with everything, although the same can be said for a good bubble and squeak.

Baked Beans - Not loads but just enough to add another texture.

Fried Bread - Only one slice needed, should be fairly crispy but not dripping with grease.

Toast - Honestly I can take or leave toast, only useful for mopping up in my opinion.

Drink - A glass of good quality Orange Juice or a cuppa.

Portion size - 2 x sausages, 2 x bacon, 2 x eggs, 1 x black pudding, some mushrooms, 2 x hash browns, a ""normal portion of beans"" and 1 slice of fried and toasted bread is fine. Quality over quantity. I would take a smaller well thought out breakfast over a heart attack sized portion any day.

This is a myth with regards to executive pay. Top executives can ride on a single  success and job hop on the back of it (parallels can be seen with football managers). Daniel Kahneman did a study on CEO performance, which is summarised here in [this FT article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/634181be-4769-11e1-b847-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Ak3uuHvD).

&gt;Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2002 for his work on decision-making and uncertainty, argued in a book published last year that we all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences and that wisdom and courage will be rewarded by success. So when it comes to evaluating business performance, we tend to place a heavy emphasis on the impact of leadership style and management practices.
But the reality is that luck plays a very large part as well. Kahneman estimates the correlation between firm success and CEO quality, and comes up with a stark conclusion. On his analysis, “Even if you had perfect foreknowledge that a CEO has brilliant vision and extraordinary competence, you still would be unable to predict how the company will perform with much better accuracy than the flip of a coin”.
This is why the performances of great companies, which have been analysed in best-selling books such as Built to Last or In Search of Excellence, usually looked much less impressive in the years after the books were published. It’s also why a study of Fortune magazine’s ‘Most Admired Companies’ finds that over a 20-year period, companies with the worst ratings went on to earn much higher stock returns than the most admired companies.
The starry performance at the outset was in good part due to luck, and was therefore bound to diminish over time. It’s what Mr Kahneman describes as a statistical fact of life: regression to the mean

Schurrle had 30 appearances last season. Willian had 25..

&gt;What? All I did for Lukaku was understand where he was as a player in his career and be able to understand his decisions to want to leave. Its not really favoritsm, unlike others here, including yourself who just bitched at him like an angry ex-girlfriend...

Understand where he was coming from? He wanted to be number 1 automatic first choice striker in Europe's 3rd or 4th best squad with a league winning, CL finalist striker in the squad alongside him. If you understood where he was coming from then you are more delusional than I thought.

&gt;As far as Willian goes he is one of my favorite players in the squad..I just don't let my admiration towards him delude my judgments of his performances. 

Oh, but you let your admiration towards Schurrle and Lukaku delude your judgements? 

&gt; He has been a shit playmaker and goalscorer for us, for the position he plays that is unacceptable and he has to improve.
You can't play the number 10 role and then not score or set up goals, I don't give a fuck how much you run around.

He has not been a shit playmaker. If you actually paid attention to his passes from inside our own half to create counter-attacks you wouldn't be this clueless. Its his contribution in the final third that lacks because he's barely ever in the final third as our main playmaker. Our play last season flowed through Hazard and Oscar, and Willian only when he played as ACM. When he did play as ACM and was our primary focus he great (check out our win vs Crystal Palace). Also, he has always said that he focused on his defensive discipline before his attacking threat. That was clearly a message conveyed to him by Jose Mourinho. I don't know how many times I have to repeat these points to you.

&gt; Fucking excuses again. Juan Mata finished as the LEAGUE LEADER IN ASSISTS with Torres as a striker. Willian couldn't even get a handful and he had Eto'o around as well.

Uhhhhh... Guess what.. Mata was playing in a **different fucking system** with no defensive balance. And guess what.. In that system, we leaked goals and finished outside the top 4. Eto'o was not asked to play as deep as Willian did. I think you have zero knowledge about how we played last season.

&gt;Umm I don't give a shit how attacking they are. Fernanindho plays as the furthest back defensive midfielder, **he should never be getting more assists than a number 10/winger. This is common sense stuff which you should know.**

And the way we played sucked the energy right out of the crowd. I don't know if it was heard on TV but the majority of people were incredibly frustrated yelling for the team to push the ball forward and press them when Soton had the ball. There were a lot of times were literally no one made runs, the ball just stuck in the back line and in the relatively rare occurrences the ball did go forwards, the crowd did get more excited and the chanting restarted. Also based on some comments,  it appears that our cheers whenever Lovren got the ball and Soton boo'ed him went unheard. 

Also as /u/smthompson said, there were a lot of tourists (including myself) but most of them didn't know the words to the chants except for YNWA and the one where we repeat Liverpool. Even the most basic ones like Reds marching in and Gerrard chant went by most people. The weather didn't help either as it was quite windy which tends to make people cave in rather than get up all excited. 

This was my first game ever at Anfield and I expected the first game to not have the greatest atmosphere, hopefully I can get tickets for another game (probably against Aston Villa) and the atmosphere will be much better.

I'm an environmental scientist, getting my masters at Harvard. I have personally crunched some of the air quality data that is released from Kings College in London. Daily averages in some areas are just under alert levels for some contaminants. It would be reasonable to assume that during rush hour you are routinely exposed to significant levels.

I'd be happy to share my report with you confidentially (It's scientific and dense though).

I'm sure someone will post that video of King's alternate transportation exposure experiment. The conclusions are misleading and the study was incredibly flawed.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"To repeat myself, I strongly suggest reading u/yes_please_vicar's link to understand the legal case for extradition, which is quite strong.

The relevent section is as follows as regards to your claim:

&gt;This one is not so much false as very misleading, but is again frequently cited by wikileaks and many other sources.  In the UK, the Crown Prosecution Service charge a suspect when police have gathered enough evidence to bring criminal proceedings.  Sweden has a different process, which the High Court summarised quite clearly (see Ground 3):

&gt;Although it is clear a decision has not been taken to charge him, that is because, under Swedish procedure, that decision is taken at a late stage with the trial following quickly thereafter. In England and Wales, a decision to charge is taken at a very early stage; there can be no doubt that if what Mr Assange had done had been done in England and Wales, he would have been charged and thus criminal proceedings would have been commenced…. On this basis, criminal proceedings have commenced against Mr Assange.

&gt;Thus, stating that Mr Assange has not been charged implies that criminal proceedings have not begun.  This is absolutely not the case.  It would be more accurate to say that Mr Assange has been avoiding being charged, or that he faces charges immediately upon his return to Sweden.

&gt;The original Supreme Court judgement stated that Assange “stands charged”. As can be seen from the High Court judgement, this is not understood to be the case, due to the different times at which charges are brought in Sweden. In England, charges mark the clear beginning of criminal proceedings.  While criminal proceedings have begun in Sweden, formal charges are only laid immediately before trial. It was pointed out to the Supreme Court that their statement was wrong, and they amended it.  The judgement does note, however, on page 90, that the extradition process is so that suspects can “face charges”.  The Supreme Court did not make any correction to the fact that Mr Assange faces criminal proceedings – just their own error which contradicted the High Court.

&gt;It is worth comparing the extradition process in the recent case of Jeremy Forest, who illegally took a schoolgirl to France with him.  A European Arrest Warrant was issued, then French police arrested and detained him, and he was then extradited. He was charged on his arrival back in the UK – the English police having no power to charge him whilst he was abroad.  Mr Assange remains outside of Sweden; he similarly cannot be formally charged until he returns.

&gt;Had Mr Forest fought extradition, then he, like Mr Assange, could accurately claim to have been detained without charges for an extended period. He would, however, like Mr Assange, be subject to criminal proceedings.",0,1408363915,null,0,false,0,cjti3bc,t3_2dv9dt,t1_cjti3bc,t1_cjthxo7,null,1435299122,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I decide to stop my days cycling early at a campsite and use the wifi to write home. Luckily the wifi was strongest in the bar. I figured of pop along, bosh out 2 or 3 emails then head back to my tent and cook some food.

Those plans went out if the window when I found out beer was 25p a pint. 8 pints in and these 2 horrendous women straight out of a Russian propaganda movie sit next to me and ordered shots. To this day I have no idea what it was. It was dark purple. I carried on drinking until I was on the verge of passing out then stumbled back to my tent.

I woke up the next day with my legs sticking out if the tent, the tent zipped around them, no trousers on. My head felt like it was in a vice made of nails. That hangover was the second worse hangover I've ever had.

People think they're fine and then they aren't very very quickly. As this is still really only end of life care, this could be seen as saving money, if you really are quite callous about it.

Being overweight and obese on the other hand gives you chronic long term conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or arthritis, which cost the NHS money over the whole of a lifetime. This is on top of the end of life care that pretty much everyone needs.

Your friend should be able to challenge any deductions fairly easily through the dispute process and possibly reduce the amount held back.

https://www.tds.gb.com/
https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview

As to whether you are liable to your friend, I believe that a verbal contract is enforcable in Scotland (whereas it wouldn't be in England), but I'm no lawyer.

If I'm honest though, it sounds like your friend has done everything that he possibly could to make things work for you, despite him having failed his year at Uni and probably having bigger concerns for himself. 

You should probably consider honouring your agreement with him. Whether you were aware of it at the time you made the agreement or not, this was a risk that you were accepting. 

The fact is that you made an agreement to live with your friend, he trusted you and stumped up the whole of the deposit. You now seem to want to deny this agreement was made and leave your friend carrying the can.

If you were to behave this way in business relationships then you would struggle to find people who will deal with you on a repeat basis, which is often 80% of your work.

I'm asking for sources here. *

&gt;Not to mention when the governor of the Bank of England stated that only a fiscal union would be feasible (as opposed to a currency union) he earned SNP accusations of meddling and bullying.

I mean this just sounds like bollocks. 

**Edit**:

 Your first remark isn't true. It is a monetary union that is called for in the whitepaper

&gt;Four currency options were examined by the Fiscal Commission - the continued use of Sterling (pegged and flexible), the creation of a Scottish currency and membership of the Euro.

&gt;They concluded that retaining Sterling as part of a formal monetary union with rest of the UK will be the best option. The Fiscal Commission proposed a practical and workable model, including governance and institutional arrangements that would create a successful and robust framework.

&gt;The Commission's analysis shows that it will not only be in Scotland's interests to retain Sterling but that - post independence - this will also benefit the rest of the UK.

&gt;Under such an arrangement, monetary policy will be set according to economic conditions across the Sterling Area with ownership and governance of the Bank of England undertaken on a shareholder basis.

It then goes on

&gt;A shared successful monetary union needs to have an adequately designed framework for financial stability and fiscal sustainability. These are areas which have also been examined in detail and reflected in the recommendations and advice of the Fiscal Commission.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"Even in competitive activities where physical strengths makes no difference at all, women tend to compete at a much lower level than men.

For example in Chess there has never been a female world champion, and only one woman (Judit Polgar) has ever come remotely close. Similarly in video games, female professional players are exceptionally rare (the only one I know of in the League of Legends scene is Colalin, who played as a substitute for Taipei Assassins).

Why is that? Is it simply that women show less interest in these games, so the talent comes from a smaller pool - in which case exactly the same could be said for football or cricket, or is there more to it than that?

I'd also suggest that the reason women are successful in Tennis, is because the men's game tends to be so heavily dominated by strength and power, leaving more room for subtlety and skill in women's tennis than men's. The women may not be able to compete on a level playing field with men, but I find there games much more enjoyable to watch.

true,bennasaurus,,Something German.,"My life is basically a permahangover.

I have many stories from my cycle trip last year and all are very much because of booze.

Or how about the time I flew to Vegas and got first tattoo.

After spending 5 hours attempting to not cry like a little bitch I left the tattoo shop with my mate, he was equally sore. Staggering about like nutters we stumbled into a dark and smoky steak house and were pointed to the back of the room.

I had the porterhouse (medium) he had a ribeye (well done, amateur). We started with a nice bottle of red wine. That was our downfall...

Meat consumed we headed to Caesars palace and were apprehended by a little hottie with $20 all you can drink wrist bands. In true English fashion we bent that bar over and shafted it like only Yorkshire men can. We went in hard with whiskey chasers. We tipped the chick $50 to make sure out table never had an empty bottle on it. 

We smoked our own weight in cheap menthol cigarettes and upset a Native American women (I ate her business card). We bought weed off this ""big black mamma"". Her tits were the size of my head.

I staggered across the 6 lane road and somehow made it to bed. Where I blacked out.

The hangover lasted for the rest of the trip. I couldn't smoke for 2 weeks.

While I was passed out my friend balanced things on me and took lots of photos to make sure I knew I was a waster. That trip taught me a lot about drinking.

Taught me Americans can't binge drink for shit and my mate is a total cunt.

Additionally the Glamour vs Value firm was studied in the 90s I believe where it was proven firms with worse fundamentals on average outperformed firms with better fundamentals - where I'd base the explanation on a) behavioural finance as investors bid up the price of firms they think are a 'sure thing' and bid down the price of firms they think are trash and b) institutional investors are constrained to only buying highly rated stocks but control much of the available investment capital, in essence crowding out returns from good stocks. 

I anticipate Kahneman's conclusions are actually related to the same phenomena - people consistently overestimate the value of strongly performing firms and underestimate the value of weakly performing firms. All the superstar CEOs will have the price bid up in a week (Steve Jobs anyone?) but over time their performance doesn't consistently beat the market enough to warrant that.

This doesn't solve the problem though that in general labour is not terribly skilled now, whereas there is a perception that certain roles are.

Leave the items on sale, prosecute anyone causing damage to any store via the normal channels. 

The idea of protesters focussing on foreign matters resulting in local stores feeling compelled to baton down their hatches is ridiculous. Why should they? This is the UK - not any Middle European country. If they want to protest then fine, but our law remains our law and they must abide by it or be prosecuted - simple.

It really won't be, like I said, in 18 months I am replaced by a robot.  18 months is nothing, it's next summer and a few more months.  Plus the rate of advancements in technology is constantly speeding up.   

Laws are already being put in place to allow automated vehicles, so the majority of people driving for a living are soon to be replaced by computers that can drive better than meat can and never need a rest.

It's great, pointless jobs are shit.

Yes. Degree-level OU courses are modular and each module is assigned points. Typically you need 120 points at level 1 (equivalent to first year full-time at uni), 120 points at level 2 (equivalent to 2nd year full-time) and 120 points at level 3 (equivalent .. you get the idea).

The OU rarely place any restrictions on how many or how few modules you want to do in any given time period, however if you were to sign up to do more than 120-points-worth of modules in a year I suspect they would very strongly try to dissuade you. Remember, that's supposed to be the same amount of effort and time that a full-time university student would be putting in. If you're trying to fit in OU studies around anything else (full time or part time work, caring for kids or sick relatives, etc) it's going to be very, very tough to even achieve 120 points in a year, let alone more.

Lloris

Fredericks - Dier - Vert - Davies

Soldado

Reasons are - Davies offers more protection for Eriksen to roam (he popped up everywhere) - I always feel Poch will flip the system and have the LB more reserved and the RB pushing forwards (Walker, Naughton, Yedlin &amp; Fredericks are all pacey as hell). Capoue can drop back into defense to cover for Fredericks going forwards.

Fredericks has massive pace, deserves a chance to shine (and will if he wants to be in contention for a spot) and can exploit the space Lamela creates on the outside by cutting in. Holtby is gifted with great vision, needs to be an AMC and he's the perfect choice pressing the CB's as he doesn't have the discipline to play MC and press effectively there. 

Soldado seems much more ''mobile'', in the sense he can be out wide and whip in a great cross (believe it or not) and he's starting to play a much more free role and not just a straight poacher.

Maybe it's my blind optimism for Holtby - but I've seen what he can do for Schalke and for all the love Eriksen gets, I believe Holtby can have as much as an impact. But I totally get your justification - in the ideal world I'd have a direct AML, like Depay, Eriksen in the middle and Lamela on the right.

&gt;

&gt;A __lock__ is a device for raising and lowering boats between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal [waterways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway). The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber in which the water level can be varied; whereas in a [caisson lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisson_lock), a [boat lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_lift), or on a [canal inclined plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_inclined_plane), it is the chamber itself (usually then called a [caisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisson_(engineering\))) that rises and falls.

&gt;Locks are used to make a [river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River) more easily navigable, or to allow a [canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal) to take a reasonably direct line across land that is not level.

a) Schalke aren't too far from us. Hell, if we played 10 times - we might edge it or it might be a stalemate. Full strength 11's. There, he was the creative hub - the 10. I watched Schalke a bit, and started to get more and more interested in German football since the BVB/Bayern rivalries the past few years when BVB won the title. They were hurting after they lost him - and were lucky they had Max Meyer and Draxler just stepping up. Lots of articles out there say ''how will they deal without his creativity?'' and such. He was important, and was German u21 captain and there's tons of stats and articles to back that up. To go from AMC Number 10 at arguably one of Germanys best clubs in the CL - to CM and loaned to Fulham is pretty crazy. 

b) He was doing this in the German league, which is miles ahead of the Dutch league when Eriksen was doing his thing. 

I'm not saying Holtby is better than Eriksen - rather Holtby has never been given a chance to prove he could be as good and as influential as Eriksen. And also I feel Holtby is a better choice AMC for Poch's system than Eriksen. It's like playing Eriksen at CM and Holtby at AMC and saying ''lets try Eriksen at AMC!''. I feel Holtby's reputation has been...tarnished, by medicore form playing CM when that's not his position. Even if he's all for playing there, and all positive about how he can play anywhere in the center...no. He's a AMC. And he has killer technique and vision that you just don't see from that deep. When he plays that deep, it just exposes all his flaws - lack of defensive discipline, pressing like crazy ALL over and not focused on the CB's and DM's of the opposing side and he can't play those cute passes if he's stuck on the halfway line.

true,houseaddict,null,null,"No, hardly anybody 'earning' that much money is paying the 45% income tax. It's not like a salary, they take it in share options, pensions, private medical care, dividends. When you work out what the rich actually pay percentage wise in tax on their incomes it is less than the 50% that poor people pay.

&gt;The highest rate of tax, that is the share of income lost in tax, is paid by the poorest 10% of households (or families). The poorest 10% of families pay 45% of their income in tax. The other 90% of families pay quite a similar rates of tax, varying between 31% and 35%. You can see this in the chart below. As your income increases you naturally pay a bigger amount of tax - but the rate (the percentage) of tax hardly changes.

&gt;Curiously this all means that, except for the very poor, the UK has what is called a 'flat tax system' - everybody pays the same rate of tax as each other. But this flat tax system is achieved by combining a progressive income tax system with a system of very high indirect or hidden taxes - what are called 'regressive' taxes that target the poorest.

Edit : Should have picked up that last bit, I actually chose 'we' deliberately. When i say we i mean tax payers, all taxpayers are right to expect that the burden falls equally on people and those that can afford to pay more, pay more. That is the case right now in terms of absolute numbers, however I feel the percentages are still some way off. The 45% tax people keep banging on about here, that used to be 80% when Thatcher first came to power and she kept it at 60% for most of her term in in office though of course it was down to 40% by the time she left.

Then the people setting up this automation are going to have a nasty shock when they realise that actually, yes, all those people you just made redundant do actually still need to be fed, housed, given healthcare etc and this will need to come out of taxes somewhere along the line.

The welfare system provides (badly in most cases) for all of these already.  Most advocates for a Basic Income however advocate a high-level for such an income, e.g. the same level as the current median salary.  What's lacking however, is any proof such schemes both: a) work as intended, and b) have no unintended consequences.  For example, the salary of the few non-automated low-value jobs would go through the roof.

It is an interesting situation though.  We're on the verge of the first time in history where the lowest rung of society (can't really call them 'working' class anymore) are entirely obsolete.

true,decemberwolf,english,Saaaf faackin Laaandaaaan,"A Tattoo gives a certain impression, just like a suit or a hoodie or dyed hair. These things identify us as belonging to a certain subculture, and Tattoos are considered unprofessional and a sign of a lifestyle which is inconsistent with a conservative lifestyle. There is nothing *wrong* with any of these things but if that is not consistent with the image that a company is trying to portray then this is entirely relevant to the situation at hand.

for example, a waitress in a hotel is supposed to serve customers and take orders whilst presenting a professional face. One working in the local wetherspoons has a different definition of professional presentation and therefore will have a different dress code. 

Having a job isn't just about having the skill to do the tasks assigned, it also requires that you fit the company image, do not bring the company in to disrepute and a plethora of other things, often image related. 

It wouldn't matter to me if a waitress had a tattoo, but if I saw a concierge with his kid's name tattoo'd on his neck when visiting the Hilton, I would certainly be taken by surprise.


Ultimately, tattoos are a choice which we all make, and which we must make after we come of age. They are an art form and have history and meaning which must be taken subjectively.

You can't tell when an ecu will fail, or a sensor will pack up, nor can you look inside the engine to see whether internal shims, valves, etc are worn. You can mitigate for a vast number of things but not everything.

Sure, but you can reduce the risk by buying as low-mileage a car as possible within your budget. Those parts will eventually go, but if your car has only done 60,000 miles, they likelihood is that they're not in too bad shape.

Well... they do and they don't. Find a good local independent mechanic, and the pricing is a lot more sensible than main dealers. If your car is more than 5 years old, you won't lose much by having non-main dealer servicing on your history.

Moyes had to go. We had finally acquired wonderful stability and his lack of faith in the youth and negative tactics started to become tired. Don't for one minute think he didn't work fucking magic during his tenure.

Tactically, bobby has taken the work rate ethic and tenacity instilled during the Moyes era and added passing play and aggression. Players like Mirallas shined under this system. Naismith finds some form. individually minded loanees Deulefeu and Lukaku stir things up. Barry and McCarthy add some incredibly needed confidence in midfield, replacing the at times horrendous constant of phil Neville. Highlighting what could be a new era.

Indeed, but I'm part of a sector of workers. Every picker in every warehouse in the UK is now very close to being replaced because it's already cost effective.  It's only going to get faster and cheaper.

There are a whole lot of pickers in this country that are very shortly going to be replaced by technology that can run faster, 24/7, doesn't need to sleep and has less picking errors.

&gt; Driverless cars are in their infancy and are nowhere near being capable of being dropped into any particular city.

They're very much are in their infancy, which is what's so great.

They're already safer than we are at driving.  Laws are being readied and masses of people working in transportation are going to be replaced rather soon.    Hardly any time has passed and they're already safer than we are.

true,LFCSAVOLVER1,null,null,"women fucking baffle me!... but to be fair i'm sure they baffle themselves from time to time... not very often though, i haven't known many of my girlfriends to assume THEY were the problem in any given tense situation... it's almost always us... im sure there's a good reason for it to continue happening otherwise it'd stop, hormones are undoubtedly a bitch, but its just a shitty situation where people get hurt. the way i see it, regardless of gender there are some unifying truths. 1. everyone loves sex. 2. everyone for the most part likes the IDEA of kids(maybe you don't want to have them/can't afford to, but we all have that triggered into us genetically). 3. most of all, romance is nice for a while until you have to think about the stresses of life together as a couple. (and if you think about it the romance only really comes back when the kids aren't around anymore, don't get me wrong they provide very different and valuable qualities that get us through life... kids are cute, naive, and curious which is why we love them so much) 

I've rambled for a bit(and brought the notion of kids into the picture in a big way), and i doubt anyone will read this and i'm sure i may be wrong about a few things, but this is just how i see it. 

By the way, I'm 25, single, no kids, and admittedly: quite cynical about romance in general because IMO society has become to complicated for it. I've simply seen too many lives destroyed by people being together who clearly were unhappy(sometimes in complete denial about it). 

Especially after doing some reading on the subject of prenups, im gonna say: breach the subject on the third date from now on just to avoid the stress. This has gotten insane. I definitely don't wanna hurt my gf/wife emotionally, i certainly don't want to hurt myself, and most importantly i don't want to hurt my kids if and when i have any... 

i would love it if a girl would weigh in on this... i hope i didn't say anything too insensitive, i'm just sharing my opinion/perspective...

This is nothing new and has been done for a variety of diseases. The plan is on the HPA website.

Nope. I've regularly worked with contractors on 150-200k. They do pay tax but it's more like 20%.

You simply pay your self a low basic, PAYE wage, the rest you pay as a divvy and get a lower rate of tax as a result. You also charge VAT at 20% and only give the government something like 11% of it. They also they get to claim back thousands more on things that we all have to pay for like travel, computers, phones (so they're not taxed on those things). MP's used to be a lot better at this but got found out and decided to clamp down a bit.

There's lots of other scams for not paying tax that I've heard of like putting your company in to an offshore umbrella scheme - but I'm reluctant to get in to those conversations.",0,1408372391,null,0,false,0,cjtl24t,t3_2dvb1o,t1_cjtl24t,t1_cjtk06l,null,1435300720,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Indeed. If he hadn't skipped bail and tried to claim asylum there'd be no additional cost of policing him.

&gt;No, absolutely, you're right

Thanks I'm glad we agree.

&gt;Do you think they put that much effort into other people who skip bail? 

I'm not aware of any comparable situations. If Assange wasn't in an Embassy then they'd be able to get a warrant to enter and arrest him - job done, no additional costs. As it is they know here he is and can't just walk away because then a person who has committed a crime in the UK (breach bail) would then be able to evade justice.

There are plenty of bail act offenders who try to evade justice and are pursued by the police. Assange is different because he ran away to an Embassy. The police have no choice but to stay there until they get him.

true,hireddithowareyou,lfcflame,,"Here is [Seydou compared to Vela](https://imgur.com/zq9EUcY) with your stat set. Not sure why I lost the stars, but here is who wins in each category:

Stat | Doumbia | Vela
---|---|----
Goals Scored | **18*** | ~~16~~
Assists | ~~7~~ | **12***
Chances Created | ~~23~~ | **78***
Shot Accuracy | **63%*** | ~~54%~~
Successful Takedowns | ~~30.99%~~ | **43.54%***
Transfermarkt.co.uk | [~~£22.24m/€27.8m~~](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/seydou-doumbia/profil/spieler/75287) | [**£17.6m/€22m***](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/carlos-vela/leistungsdaten/spieler/35773/saison/2013)


Now Doumbia has played only half the minutes of Vela and maybe 2/3 of the number of games, so I think analyzing the numbers on a per game basis is useful.

Stat | Doumbia | Vela
---|---|----
Goals Scored | **0.81***  | ~~0.43~~
Assists | ~~0.3181~~ | **0.3243***
Chances Created | ~~1.05~~ | **2.11***

I couldn't figure out a good way to convert the percentages into something I could calculate on a per game basis so I removed those. Never watched him play so I can't give you more than this, but based on the stats, the fact Vela plays in La Liga versus Doumbia in the RPL, and the predicted price according to Transfermarkt (even more so if I use your €20m predicted price), I'm going to side with your original choice and say Vela is the best buy of the group.

EDIT: Thought it would be useful to add some videos. Unfortunately the choice of audio isn't the best, so don't hesitate to mute your speakers before clicking the links.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Why not? 

I have no particular axe to grind (although I support legalisation for pragmatic reasons), but Aedonix is right.  There is very little evidence that demonstrates that cannabis directly *causes* mental health problems.

It is the all-important different between *correlation* and *causation*.  For example, there is also a [high correlation between people who smoke tobacco and those who have schizophrenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia_and_smoking), but that's not to say that smoking tobacco causes schizophrenia either.

The study you linked to makes this absolutely clear in the second sentence of the first paragraph.

&gt; This study could not establish whether adolescent cannabis use was a consequence of pre-existing psychotic symptoms or a cause.

In that context, Aedonix's comment was more or less correct.

&gt; There is zero evidence to support the theory that cannabis *causes* mental problems. It is entirely possible though that it can bring out ones that are already present though, but that would be true no matter what drug was taken

I don't know about ""zero evidence"", specifically, but there are lots of studies that show correlation and none that I'm aware of that show conclusive causation.

There are also studies (such as one published in the European Journal of Psychiatric Research a few years ago) that shows that the overall rates of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders has stayed constant or declined slightly in the general population over the past 40 years, despite the fact that cannabis consumption has increased significantly.  If stronger cannabis is being smoked by more people more often then why has the percentage of people with mental health problems stayed the same?

One of the problems with cannabis research is that it is often funded and/or authorised by government agencies whose mandate is to *reduce* drug consumption.  As such, proposals for research that aims to *disprove* a connection between cannabis and mental health issues (for example) are much less likely to get approved than ones setting out to prove it.  

My personal opinion, for what it's worth, is that people with mental health issues should avoid, or at least be very careful in their cannabis consumption. I have little doubt that the two are intimately connected, even if it's not a causative relation.",0,1408373473,null,0,1408373794,0,cjtlj6t,t3_2dskrh,t1_cjtlj6t,t1_cjsq63t,null,1435300989,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So many techniques and pieces of equipment were developed during the troubles that have been used the world over. 

Some of the best plastic surgeons and violent injury doctors learned their trade here in the 70s and 80s; or learn from those who did. Especialy with bomb and burns victims. 

Also; policing. We had the worlds first professional police force in the RIC (another export across the world; Custer died with an RIC pistol on him) and for all the RUC's faults many new tricks and techniques were developed. The first plastic baton rounds based off wooden ones used in Hong Kong, better plastics in riot shields, better tactics in riot control and in the military too. The ""Paddy pusher"" was first used here. To reasonably good effect. ""Snatch squads"" as well; used the world over to nab people. 

Bomb squads use techniques learned in NI. Hell, terrorists in the middle east are still using bombs like the ones the IRA used. And people can defuse them because of training from guys who did the same jobs here. 

A quote from a book I have called the British Army in Ulster: ""Ulster, in fact, has turned into an excellent proving ground for pieces of Army equipment and technology of all kinds, and numerous advances have been made to keep pace with the situation.""

Like it or not; as much as I think we should be known for other things we shouldn't shy away from the Troubles. Terrible times; but a load of cool shit was developed and I dont' think anything begs more investigation and understanding than those times. 

Maybe we could move past it if the government opened up its books and admitted its activity and so the same with members of the PIRA et al. But that is unlikely. ",1,1408373911,null,0,false,0,cjtlqes,t3_2dvh3q,t1_cjtlqes,t3_2dvh3q,null,1435301118,-1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-1

I came to the conclusion that your monthly income tax is calculated on your income **rounded down to the nearest pound**. Any remainder will then be added as a carry over income to the next pay packet and the cycle repeats. The 20p variance derives from the fact you're only in the 20% tax bracket.

For example, imagine your taxable income is £1000.40 and income tax is 20%

Month 1 - Income tax due = 20% of £1000.40 = £200. This leaves 40p carryover due to rounding down the income.

Month 2 - Income tax due = 20% of £1000.40 + 40p carryover = £200 again. This time you have 80p carryover.

Month 3 - Income tax due = 20% of £1000.40 + 80p carryover. This time your income plus carryover goes into the next pound and thus you're taxed £200.20 with 20p carryover.

Seeing the spread of a players rating will be able to judge how reliable that rating is, with presumably lower reliable players being less impactful as otherwise people would have noticed them one way or the other...

Really ? Every time ? What about all of the people accused of assault, or domestic violence, or sexual assault who are granted conditional bail but subsequently breach it. Is it still an offence that has no direct consequences for anyone except police procedure ?

Breach Bail is a serious offence that the police will pursue. If they know where the person is they'll go and get him and won't let him go. Just like Assange.

&gt;would this cost exist if Assange had remained on Bail outside the Embassy ?

&gt;No

You know this is the real answer. If Assange had remained on bail and not fled then the additional policing costs would have been £0.

Anything else is just a lot of words.

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"The most common example is when hiring actors for a part or models you can hire people of a specific age/skin colour/gender/etc. This is actually a reasonably big deal because you can simply say that a part of your clothing stores clerks jobs is to ""model"" clothes during work and then you can get away with only hiring attractive* (well, women who appear to be aged between 18-24 with a BMI between 18 and 22 and a bust size... etc. because that's who the clothes arae designed to fit) staff for clothes stores.

Another example is I think that religious organisations can hire people based on their faith if they can show a genuine need for that role/faith. For example, if all employees are expected to lead a prayer group I *think* you can specify that the applicant be a practising member of your faith.

You can also always word the requirements of a job carefully if there is a genuine need for it, for example, if you are looking for a person to provide rape counselling for women raped by men then you could have as job requirements the ability to empathise with the people you work with and the ability to make them feel comfortable in you're presence. You could then reasonably hire a woman over a man on those grounds (and if you swap genders then you can hire the other way).

The idea of not working and being given a comfortable income is just not going to sit well with those who are still working.

Simpson is a bit more of a head-scratcher; if we are planning on playing a good chunk of our games in an alternate formation with a more traditional 4 man back line, then he shouldn't want for playing time. Otherwise, the harsh reality is that he's a (perhaps unsuitable) backup for Isla, or someone you wheel out to sit on a lead. Cup games too. We saw Traoré fulfilling the role as required on Saturday, getting into those one-on-one footraces chasing balls down the wing. He has the pace to do that, Simpson usually won't. Maybe there will be a game or two where they'll know the opposition have to line up with someone slower for whatever reason, and they can give him a run-out.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Who will unload the lorries and trucks? Who will load them? 

Robots, which will be able to load lorries with much less cm^3 error as a bored human paid £6.50 an hour. 

&gt; Who will knock on the doors, hand over the parcels and record their signatures? If they turn up at the wrong address, who will find out where they need to go? 

The automated pod will arrive to the location you asked, be that home, work or to your exact location at any given moment.  Recording signatures is as simple as NFC tech we already have, or recording a photo of person that handles the package.  Either way, the errors will cost less than they currently do.

&gt; Who will maintain the vehicles? Who will keep tabs on each of the vehicles and any small individual faults that would be picked up by a human driver? Who will go out to fetch a vehicle that has suddenly decommissioned itself in the middle of the country and lost its signal?

Maintenance can also be handed via automation.  Computers are much better at handling data than we are.  Faults / errors can be booked for inspection. 

The main thing is much fewer humans will be involved.

&gt; Who will make sure they're all back in their parking bays at the end of the day, make sure they're all switched off and locked up? 

Ermm, you know we're talking about automation right?

&gt; We could go on forever. Each example I've just thought of in the last few minutes is a new business niche. I can't wait for driverless cars, but until we create real AIs and actual on-the-ground robots (definitely not happening in the next 18 months), people are always going to be needed.

We could, but even these minor faults are not stopping progress.  Driverless cars are here, right now.  

I don't know why people keep saying 18 months.  That was a figure I gave with regards to MY job.  Which IS being replaced in 18 months with a warehouse that has 60% automation.  60% if not more of the place I work out will be replaced by automation very soon, drivers are next.

We were promised ""more attacking football"" and indeed saw more possession and chances than what we saw most of last year. But we saw him play three players well beyond their depth (Nolan, Cole, Vaz Te) and that made for a lot of poor chances. Vaz Te was the performance I was most satisfied with, because he looked a menace save his finishing... but we really need to be more clinical up front, and we need more support for our finishers.

There are probably 8-10 clubs in Ligue 1 that could easily hack it in the premier league, so the level of competition is above the Championship.

EDIT: I should add that I think sending attacking players on loan to Ligue 1 would not be as beneficial as the level of defense is not as high there, and the level of attack is quite high. That makes it a much greater challenge for a developing defender than a developing attacker. Someone at the career stage and playing position of Alberto or Suso would probably not benefit as much as someone like Ilori for that reason in Ligue 1.

true,seoi-nage,null,null,"I sat an engineering interview in December 2005. From what I remember:

1) Not a lot. In fact basically nothing. The only mild bit of preparation that I had did was to read some newspaper articles about nuclear power, because I had selected that from a list of ~10 topics to discuss in my interview. 

2) The questions that I remember are:

a) [In a civil-focussed interview, since I had indicated that my main interest was civil engineering] ""If you were to show a visitor around your local area, what work of civil engineering would you take them to see?"" I talked about a viaduct near to my house, which it later turned out had been worked on by my interviewer. 

b) ""Do you agree with the current government's [Blair's labour] stance on nuclear power"". Can't really remember how I answered this one. I think I just gave a balanced answer and tried to argue both sides of the debate.

c) ""Look at these two clamps [I was handed a G-clamp and a spring clamp]. What do you think the advantages and disadvantages of each clamp are?"" I think I talked about: ease of manufacture, ease of use, durability, and maximum clamping force. Then as a follow up question: ""How would you go about manufacturing each type of clamp?"".

d) ""Draw a graph of sin(x)/x"". I'd never seen this function before so got it pretty wrong at the first attempt, but they helped me figure out the correct graph.

e) They asked me to come up with an expression for the power output of a water wheel. I can't remember exactly how they built up the question, but I don't think they simply asked me to derive the expression from scratch.

There were doubtless lots of other questions, but I can't remember them now.

3) I wouldn't think so. Their job is to teach you the first year course. In the interview I think they're more looking for you to demonstrate (1) a good grasp of the maths and physics that you're studying at school, and (2) an interest in all things engineering. I'd suggest your time would be better spent reading up on anything in the news that contains engineering issues.

Garcia was at his best near the end of last season when both City and their opponents were more fatigued and slower and he could use his strength, height and reliable short passing to keep City in control and prevent any opposite momentum building.   

 Yesterday (though this is just one game mind you) I rarely felt Fernando was in control of anything. He was good at recovering and making up for his/others mistakes using his pace and absolutely sick slide tackles but City only looked capable of 'seeing out' the game at 1-0 when Fernandinho came on to reinforce the midfield.   

Anyway as I said this was just from one game and I admit I didn't see many of the pre-season games so I'm probably not the best one to judge, though I'm fairly certain there was a Porto fan that said something very similar either on /r/mcfc or the official Fernando signing thread.",0,1408382774,null,0,false,0,cjtq8o5,t3_2dvxan,t1_cjtq8o5,t1_cjtoqqw,null,1435303457,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

Just think about that, 2 years before my Gran was born, the British Empire still existed and was at the biggest it ever was. 

We are still holding onto that. We are trying to hold onto our place as a dominant force in the world, punching far above our weight for a country the size we are now.

The Empire allowed the UK to become a center of many kinds of industries and technologies, during the Industrial Revolution, and today, in what I call the Financial Revolution.

We are still riding the wave that the Empire started, the Government is doing what it can do to show the world we are important that we are a dominant country in international politics. This won't last for ever, we will fall on our arses and have to take a back seat, but successive Governments are trying to ride the wave as long as they can.

Poch was brought in to get us playing attractive stuff and really it wasn't much of a change from how things went last season (granted we won, so that should come into play), but a lot of spurs fans prioritise an improvement in our style of play.

I know it's his first game, but this is a match rating, not a season rating and so I just base it off the performance, which even with even numbers wasn't wonderful. The red card does make it difficult to judge as it becomes reactionary management at that point but maybe how he reacted wasnt the only thing on my mind.

It's clear now that AVB was simply not a good man manager; he didn't really know how to handle many players, and that caused discontent in the locker room, which will only spread.

Sherwood, similarly, just basically ignored a large number of the new signings, for reasons that still aren't clear to me.

In any events I think Capoue (and the rest of the Magnificent 7) have, in Pochettino a coach who values them as players, and has the right combination of man-management skills and tactical acumen.
