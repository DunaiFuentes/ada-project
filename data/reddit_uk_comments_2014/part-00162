true,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; I was surprised at just how few actual rough sleepers there are out there - I thought it would be far higher.

It probably is. I've been out and tried to locate homeless people to confirm if they're rough sleeping and check out our local hotspots (as a job - it's not a hobby) and we know for a fact we don't see everyone. The majority of rough sleepers don't wan't to be found because it's extremely dangerous, I'd imagine it's a lot easier to remain hidden in London.

What you'd describe as ""persistent, genuinely homeless"" people are in many cases accessing accommodation, albeit short term and unsuitable. I know the most prolific rough sleepers in my own city tend to spend their time in a combination of hostels, hospitals, prison, with friends/family, in other cities or in local authority accommodation. I'd imagine the same is true for London, those numbers are just a snapshot and the problem is much larger in scale when you take into account that not all homeless people are on the streets, but it doesn't take much to get them there.

It's about investing more in drug an alcohol treatment and mental illness, but also access to housing, housing support, adult and child social care and education.

Liverpool winger impresses England manager
In the sweltering heat of Miami Shores yesterday, one England player came nicely to the boil. Raheem Sterlingâs performance on the training pitch at Barry University was described as âbreathtakingâ and âunstoppableâ by Roy Hodgson, which makes it all the more regrettable that the Liverpool winger will miss Englandâs final World Cup warm-up match today through suspension.

The meeting with Honduras at the Sun Life Stadium represents Englandâs final rehearsal before their World Cup campaign begins with the demanding assignment against Italy in Manaus in a weekâs time. In an ideal world, Sterling would have a belated chance to push his claims for a starting place next Saturday, demonstrating the pace and the verve that left his manager and his team-mates enthralled yesterday, but his suspension, after a red card against Ecuador on Wednesday, represents a lost opportunity for player and team.
If there is one thing that abounds among the latest crop of English youngsters, whom Hodgson congrat-ulated himself on being âboldâ to include in his 23-man squad, it is not defensive fortitude or tactical disci-pline. It is speed.

Theo Walcott has missed out on this tournament through injury, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlainâs medial knee ligament trouble remains a source for deep concern, even though he will join the squad in flying from Miami to Rio de Janeiro after todayâs game.

There is justifiable excitement surrounding Ross Barkley, potentially a secret weapon for England in the tournament, but Sterling â on the basis of his Liverpool form this season, rather than just yesterdayâs training session â is the youngster who looks best equipped to make an immediate impact in Brazil.
Even before Sterling was sent off for what Hodgson called an âover-exuberant, slightly recklessâ challenge on Antonio Valencia, it had been suggested from within the camp that the manager was leaning away from starting with him against Italy. The red card and subsequent suspension seemed to decrease his chances further, given that by next Saturday he will have played 39 minutes of football in five weeks, but Hodgson maintained yesterday that the Liverpool winger is in his thoughts for a starting role against Italy.
âIf you saw training, you will have seen some outstanding moments from him and other young players,â Hodgson said. âHis reaction to the red card has been excellent. He was unstoppable at times in training. Some of the things he did out there were breathtaking and heâs not going to lose any fitness. He was going to start this game. When he was sent off, that was a blow to my plans, but it doesnât affect his chances of playing when the tournament starts.â

Steven Gerrard has been impressed with Sterlingâs response to his message when he joined his young Liverpool team-mate in the dressing room after the Ecuador game. âStraightaway after the incident I spoke to him in the dressing room and I said it was important he put himself back in the frame for Italy, and heâs done that,â the England captain said. âHe was the best player in training.â

The feeling persists that it will take a change of view from Hodgson, perhaps caused by underperformance from others today, for Sterling to start against Italy. Against Honduras, unless he succumbs to the temptation to try out a 4-3-3 formation, the manager is expected to revert to the front four who started in the 3-0 win over Peru eight days ago, which means Adam Lallana, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck in support of Daniel Sturridge.
âPeople are trying to second-guess every team and the formation,â Hodgson said with regard to questions about his plans for Honduras and, more to the point, Italy.
âIs this the starting XI? Is he going to play this way? Is this the formation? But I reserve the right to put the team out that I want to play in this game. If people get it wrong in trying to second-guess me, thatâs their responsibility.â

Hodgson was asked whether the temperatures, both in Miami and in Manaus, would have any impact on his selection plans, perhaps compromising the contribution of an energetic box-to-box midfield player such as Jordan Henderson, who is expected to start alongside Gerrard today.

âThe thing about the heat is that itâs standard for everybody,â the manager said. âEven the South American teams find it quite hard. Iâm not going to change everything weâre doing because itâs hot. We have to make sure we can get through these games and can play 90 minutes in the heat. â
Interestingly, encouragingly, Hodgson added that he expects to shuffle his pack â not just within games but between games, getting away from the traditional idea of a first-choice starting XI â to combat the type of fatigue that England have suffered in previous tournaments.
Hodgson still hopes that Oxlade-Chamberlain will be able to make an impact in Brazil. The Arsenal youngster, who injured a knee in the match against Ecuador, will be part of the squad that flies to Rio overnight this evening, while Jon Flanagan and John Stones, the young defenders, remain on standby in case the FA decides before Fridayâs deadline that, with Fifaâs approval, Oxlade-Chamberlain needs to be replaced. Stones will fly home tomorrow while Flanagan will stay on in Florida on holiday.

âI will alert [Flanagan and Stones] that, if the worst happens, I will probably bring one of those two back,â Hodgson said. âTheyâre both fit young men in top physical condition, but I hope the chances of that are very slim because we want to keep Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with us.â
Again, we were talking about a man who would play no part against Honduras. It is up to those selected today to do their bit to ensure England can thrive without their young flyers.

&gt; He said Tasers were an ""effective and ""less lethal alternative"" to firearms.

[In this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7952817.stm) the point is reiterated and again ascribed to Paul McKeever

[This article]( http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/uk-police-get-6000-tasers-national-roll-out) directly quotes Paul, rather than paraphrasing, as saying

&gt; Not only does Taser provide a less lethal alternative to firearms but it provides confidence and reassurance to officers when confronted with volatile situations

and now I'm bored of googling. But I think it's safe to say that the idea of them being an an alternative to firearms is a bit more than ""internet facts"".

The last thing our government would really want in the event of a national emergency is a load of untrained, unskilled people wandering around it. I don't know what kind of national emergency would lead to a draft, but you asked.

No war will bring the UK together against a common enemy. Our country is too diverse to truly be on a total war footing again.

WWIII would likely create greater divides in our country, each time it has looked like that our country is going to go to war in the last 10 years (Post Iraq, roughly) we have seen a greater movement towards protesting the fact that we are going elsewhere to fight. In the situation of WWIII, this may not entirely be the case, but it is likely to have a very similar response.

In 2007 firearms officers were allowed to use them in situations where firearms had not been authorised. Also in 2007, tasers began to be issued to non-specialist officers.

By 2009 they were used over 3000 times, in 2012 over 8000 times and in 2013 over 10000 times.  Incidents where people have been tasered include a number of ill and disabled people who were unable to comply with officer due to their medical condition - for example a blind man whose white stick was mistaken for a sword and a person in a diabetic coma on a bus, some-one was even shot off their bike with one FFS.

There have been a pile of complaints from people who were not offering any threat to police, merely not complying with what they believed to be unreasonable demands and were shocked as punishment.

true,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Temporary accommodation is for people that present to the local authority as homeless. To be offered temporary accommodation the local authority must believe that you have some kind of priority need - you must be able to demonstrate that if you were left to sleep on the streets, that you would be more vulnerable than the average person.

In reality this boils down to people with children, the disabled (severe mental or physical) There are some other exceptions as well but generally speaking. The council can also offer you accommodation whilst they investigate your circumstances. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the council may only house you temporarily, or accept that they have a full duty to house you. Local authorities use B&amp;B accommodation and private rented accommodation because they do not have enough space in their own temporary accommodation (usually because of their own lack of social housing stock) Going down this route usually falls under the term statutory homelessness and the laws are set out in the [housing act 1996 (Part 7 is the good bit)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/52/contents) and the [homelessness act 2002](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/7/contents) mostly boring but has some stuff about reviews - you're legally entitled to ask the local authority to review their decision though the majority are upheld.

Homelessness for which there is no statutory involvement is usually called single homelessness and this includes hostels, night shelters etc. There's no requirement for a local authority to have a hostel (or shelter, they're interchangeable) so it's not uncommon for a rural area to have anywhere for single homeless clients. Local authorities tend to have hostels which are commissioned (i.e. paid for by the tax payer) run by charities, or run by faith groups. Hostels might have local connection criteria (e.g must have a connection to the local authority) and have wet/dry alcohol policies.

&gt;A few days is nowhere near statistically significant enough to get in a fuss about. Measure daily but take weekly trends. If you do an office job and don't do much exercise, assume that ""sedentary"" estimates are pretty close. Cut 500 kcal from that and expect to lose 1lb/week.

Yes, yes, I know I know. Trouble is, I'm impatient. I have old dresses I want to fit into. I lost 1.5 pounds overnight, which is pretty remarkable given I had two bottles of wine for dinner. So, in future, I shall be on a wine diet.

true,Flower_Fairy,null,null,"No you're right, we're not talking about just surgery or physical transition. In the same way that putting on a dress doesn't make you a woman, having a vagina doesn't make you a woman and a penis doesn't make you a man.

First let me establish some basics. Sex (male, female, intersexed, etc.) refers to physical characteristics like genitalia, body shape, hormone levels, and chromosomes. This is typically used interchangeably with gender, but when talking scientifically about transgender people, gender refers to gender identity.

Gender identity is a scientifically recognised phenomenon believed to be formed at ~3 years of age, after which it is extremely difficult or impossible to change. It is an individual's private sense of their own gender, and a fundamental part of their sense of self. Most people are not aware of it because it matches their sex, but in transgender people there exists for some reason (one theory I've heard looked at the hormonal washes that take place on the body and brain in the womb) a mismatch between their sex and gender. Some trans people are aware of this incongruence from a very young age and know their real gender as children, some don't figure it out until they're older, sometimes much older.

In whatever case the mismatch causes gender dysphoria, a medical condition that comprises a high risk for stress, isolation, anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem and suicide. Some also feel completely detached and removed from their body, leading to the cliche of ""a man in a woman's body"". Gender dysphoria is so severe that [41% of trans people attempt suicide](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/28/local/la-me-ln-suicide-attempts-alarming-transgender-20140127). The only treatment for this condition is physical and social transition to make the individual's sex match their gender identity.

When we talk about whether or not someone is a man or a woman, even outside of transgender specific cases, it makes sense to include trans men as men and trans women as women. The trans part is just a modifier like gay, white, short or whatever. We respect their self-reported gender identity over their physical sex, partly because it's extremely painful for them when we don't, but also because it makes logical sense to; a trans woman has the same gender identity as a cis woman does, and it's gender identity that is important when it comes to who that person is, to that person's identity. Going by sex wouldn't make sense, for one thing sex isn't binary whatever system you use. Some men lose their genitals in accidents or at war but still consider themselves men, some people have [rare chromosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Klinefelter_XXY) etc.

Sorry this is long, but it's a complex topic and not as simple as some people would like to think.

There is no air conditioning on our Spanish-built trams.

http://schwandl.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/edinburgh-tram.html
&gt; Otherwise the CAF trams feature most things one would expect of a new tram, screens announcing the next stop, acoustic announcements, etc. but no air-conditioning, and as it appeared, no proper ventilation either. Unexpectedly, the first day of operation, 31 May 2014, turned out to be a very warm day, and with the trams packed with curious passengers, the air inside the trams got quite unbearable despite some open windows.

&gt; âExcuse me...when does the driver switch on the air conditioning?â I ask.

&gt; After all, these trams were built in Spain and they must know how to keep cool.

&gt; The ticket man fixes me with one of those stares which indicates that he's encountered a pain-in-the-backside when everyone else is enjoying themselves as if on a fairground attraction.

&gt; âWell sir. We have a system of circulating air to keep the cabins cool,â he says.

&gt; I'm looking around now and see some vents in the ceiling. I raise my hand to feel the strength of the air circulation but there's not much air coming in.

&gt; There's only one window, ajar at the top, further down the cabin while the other windows can't be opened.

&gt; I ask the inspector: âCan't the driver just switch on the air conditioning?â

&gt; âAs I say sir...it's a system which circulates the air and it's on all the time.â

&gt; âYou mean there's no air conditioning?â

&gt; âEr...well no. But we don't really need air conditioning in Scotland. Ha Ha Ha.â

No other player in our squad can create a goal like Gylfi can - his powerful and quick shot really astounds me. Not too many players like him, and those that can't see that must be blind. Look at the power he can get on the ball while mid stride or jumping in the air in this vid - name me 5 other players that can do that. 

Maybe he could be a good substitute for Lambert in our squad? He could play as a playmaking and ball distributing CF, though he's better a little farther back. 

I really do like Gylfi and I hope he does well with us this next season. If he leaves, and I really think he should if he doesn't get solid minutes, then I'll be a fan of his wherever he goes.

true,watchthatcorkscrew,hampshire,Hampshire,"I think it helps to remember that we don't all share identical biology, but the more extreme traits (such a genitals) can and have been traditionally grouped in the binary male/female - that doesn't mean they should be, and the fact that trans individuals exists indicates that the issue of gender is far more complex. 

Fundamentally, gender is a construct, where we decided what was 'masculine' belonged to 'males' and what was 'feminine' belonged to 'females'. This is patently untrue - we learn to culturally perform 'maleness' and 'femaleness' from our role models and the behaviours we are rewarded for. Gender is a sliding scale, rather than a set of categories: so then, it follows that biological sex will not always (or ever fully) match up with these ideas of man/woman. When trans individuals express that they identify with the opposite gender to their sex, they are identifying with the other end of that gender spectrum, not telling you they have switched biologically. Though they may have physically changed, you have to remember that - like I said earlier - there is no universal experience of the male or female body. Even in terms of height, strength, build, amount of hair on the body, voice tone, expression, fitness, genital shape and size, etc etc., we all vary so hugely, so it is entirely possible to alter this and identify with womanhood or manhood even though your cellular, biological make up is strictly medically male or female.

This does raise further questions about gender realignment surgery, and it's not something I have experience of so wouldn't want to comment on with any conviction, but I would suggest that its a mixture of needing to fit into cultural zones of 'normality' but also to find a way of identifying with their own body.

See, that's the problem.

I used to feel the same way, until I was fortunate enough to meet a very good transgender speaker called [Jacqui Gavin](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=jacqui%20gavin). 

I'm not going to lie; I went along to see how much of a bloke she looked like.

Fifteen minutes in, I'd totally forgot that's why I went. I became acutely and powerfully aware that I was looking at a woman who'd struggled with her identity her entire life, because of what her body looks like. Like a fat girl who thinks she's ugly, or a tall girl who thinks she isn't feminine, Jacqui's identity was not her skin (although she was, in fact, very feminine). 

Some people are born in to this world trapped in a body they didn't choose. Did you ever have one of those days where you feel like you didn't ask for this, where you didn't ask to be born, where you don't want to do a certain thing but you have to because it's expected of you? It's like that for these people, every day, but worse.

I can't say this applies to all transgender people, but it seems to be the case for the majority: there is no point where they choose to become (eg) a woman. There's not a day where they wake up and think ""you know what, stuff this for a game of soldiers, I want to be a chick."" It's a deep rooted identity that they have always had, often desperately trying to reject, but they realise the truth is that they have always been a woman in everything but the bits growing off their body (and, typically, what their parents want them to be...) Do you choose to grow cancer? No, it just fucking happens, but it doesn't dictate who you are. So you cut that shit out of your body.

So now I find myself getting very annoyed when I see stuff like

&gt; a real woman

because it implies not only are transgender people *not* women, or never can be, but that they never were to begin with. That's a fundamental misunderstanding of the trans community.

I mean you're talking about a group of people who think their lives would be easier with their sex organs surgically mutilated, their hormones reversed, and their place in society automatically dropped to one of the lowest pegs and they'll take shit for that their entire lives.

You think someone does that if they don't genuinely believe that transitioning will give them something unimaginably important to them? 

So before you spit out three words of ""a real woman"", think about *what that means* to someone who wants nothing more than to be seen as female.",0,1402182271,null,0,1402182452,0,ci1s8bk,t3_27joso,t1_ci1s8bk,t1_ci1nhlv,null,1434139051,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

While in some species the *roles* they do are different (ie female lions hunt, which is generally considered a 'male' thing in human society), there *are* differences.  A biologist can distinguish a male dog from a female dog, a male whale from a female one.   Gender is a fundamental part of most forms of life- and it's the same for humans too.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"If you take just devolved departments (Things that are likely to remain unchanged) our government employment rate is only about 1% higher than the rest of the UK. 

The 5% bump (Our 23% rate vs UK's 18% rate) is caused by ~100k jobs in non-devolved departments, IE UK-wide institutions with locations in Scotland. 

The exact number of jobs lost will depend on how divisional those non-devolved departments are. If the Scottish locations focus on the Scottish end of the system then we won't lose many, we'll need our own versions of those systems anyway. Anything that runs something for the rest of the UK will lose a lot because our version of it won't need to be as big.

(Take public corporations for example, 17k jobs.. but if you look at the list of public corporations located in Scotland pretty much all of them have 'Scottish' or 'of Scotland' in the title, indicating they are regional wings not head departments. In fact I'm having a hard time finding one that hasn't been set up just to deal with Scotland)

I'd say maybe about half of those 100k would be lost, so assuming nobody goes *with* the job it's an unemployment increase of ~2.5%. That's before considering any completely new government jobs created, it's entirely possible the SNP is planning some 50k employee energy management department, I don't know.

true,watchthatcorkscrew,hampshire,Hampshire,"Ok, I probably wasn't clear: in critical terms there is a difference between sex and gender. Sex is the biological make-up, gender is the 'role' and performance. What you described is sex, which allows scientists to - as you point out - identify a male whale from a female whale. However, in terms of role there are common roles, yet the observable roles vary massively between species (lion/chimp/ant) and within species. Also, these roles commonly become less defined the more 'advanced' a species is from a evolutionary standpoint. Lions are instinctual creatures, their biology dictates their male/female role, they're not functioning on cultural norms in the same way (though that's the usual nature/nurture debate and its impossible to be certain whether genetics or culture can solely influence anything). 

In these examples, like whales, their societal structures usually influence those 'roles' - essentially, male whales don't carry the foetus so they have more partners and have to be more aggressive to win partners and the like. Even so, their observable gender roles change - there are aggressive females, etc. Dolphins are really interesting because they have sex for pleasure and bully each other and communicate in far more complex ways, and they have even less of an observable gender structure. 

Humanity is far far far more advanced, our gender structures are so far removed from our biological sex because we partner up, we use language and travel and plan and can manipulate and coerce in ways entirely removed from our base instincts so we can create incredibly interesting and complex cultures and societal groups. Our gender is therefore removed even further from our biological sex. Just to say that dogs have established gender roles so so does humanity is like saying 'dogs sometimes trade things for sex and affection but don't have shops so we should dismantle our economic system right away' (also, if you have a dog you may well have observed totally unusual gender traits - my friends female dog is a more aggressive pack animal than my male dog and is always dominating him even though he's older and bigger, its just individual differences).",0,1402183871,null,0,false,0,ci1stx5,t3_27joso,t1_ci1stx5,t1_ci1s8pe,null,1434139334,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;None of your points seem to be arguments for an independant Scotland. 

They are. 

The political spectrum represented in Westminster is very narrow, this is mainly a result of the political system we have (FPTP, uncodified constitions). There is not the political will to reform the UK and thus we are unlikely to see alternative or more diverse politics come in to play. 

Furthermore, the politics represented at Westminster are to the right of those in Scotland. Whole areas such as welfare remain reserved to Westminster and thus the policies we are seeing implemented are much further to the right than popular political opinion in Scotland  (also things like immigration).
We are also seeing changes in (mainly) England of things like the NHS, Education. It has become apparent since the Tories were elected in 2010 that devolution is unable to cope with major divergence in these areas (and further divergence seems likely, consider the rise of UKIP in England and Wales).

The setup we have at the moment is not fit for purpose and not likely to reformed in the near future. At the same time the rise of intraEuropean politics has seen the need for the UK as a single, centralized political unit diminish. 

&gt;They're just the same complaints many English people have about Westminster too

&gt;I actually gave you a great response about how hamstrings could potentially harm you if they are not properly taken care of and gave you a whole list of examples.
(You conveniently didn't respond when I gave you a whole list of PL players whose careers where greatly affected by their hamstrings)

Yeah, I didn't respond because I did not want to respond to such silly examples which had nothing to do with Costa. You don't want us to sign him because he has 1 minor injury that had not had enough time to recover. Superb analysis. What I was arguing was that hamstring injuries are RARELY ever career threatening. Terry has had hamstring injuries in the past and he played through it before getting surgery, after which he had zero problems with it. Your examples were idiotic. Yeah Aguero had an injury problem with his hamstring this season.. because he was rushed back like Costa. Michael Owen was old too old and too fragile after sitting on Madrid's bench and moving to Newcastle. Louis Saha was just injury prone like RVP. Kieron Dyer is not even a real example because he never played for a big enough club. Walcott another player who is constantly rushed back. Jack Rodwell another example of injury prone player who has had injury issues since he was young, just like RVP, just like Dyer. So yeah.. How about you give me an example of a player who hasn't been rushed back, isn't naturally injury prone (which Costa isn't) and still has problem with his hamstring..

&gt;Do you think Ramires is better than Khedira, Modric, Di Maria and Xabi Alonso? Because if you think he will start then he will have to be.
A simple yes or no answer should suffice..

He isn't better but he is just as good as all those players. He doesn't have any amazing technical abilities like Alonso or Modric but his work-rate his higher than all of them. Including Di Maria. He isn't the best in tackling but he's definitely better than Di Maria at it and he just as amazing at breaking up play. Just because he hasn't been good enough for the last few months people like you are wanting him to be sold. Not even half a bad season is what it takes for you to turn on a player.

Also, I was going to write a big block of text about the hamstring thing but I am not going to get in petty arguments with you so I will keep this brief. Costa is in the WC, if he tweaks his hamstring again he will be rushed back, if he does so anytime in the season for us, as our only world class striker he would be rushed back. That was my entire point. All of those players fucked up their careers and hamstrings by continuously rushing back. Do you think Walcott is more important to Arsenal then Costa would be to us??

&gt; Do you think Ramires is better than Khedira, Modric, Di Maria and Xabi Alonso? Because if you think he will start then he will have to be. A simple yes or no answer should suffice..

What I am defending though, is the existence of 'gender' in the first place.  And if biological 'sex' does exist (ie male/female) and gender (ie man/woman) is flexible, why do transgenders call themselves 'MTF' (ie female to male) rather than 'MTW' or (man to woman)?  Clearly there is a belief in the trans community that you are changing *sex*, and that is simply untrue in my opinion. 

Right now we are at a point where any remotely competent doctor, given 5 minutes with a trans person's body, could distinguish that they are not, in fact, an actual male/female.   Until gender surgery truly switches genders so that differences (everywhere from the brain to the genitals) are nonexistent between a trans person and a birth-gender person, I cannot accept that the wholesale switching of genders is possible.  

That's my point.   That until medical science advances to a sufficient degree that it is possible, on the smallest relevant biological level, to become another gender, I don't think it's possible to consider an FTM male or an MTF female.

Lol. So anyone that disagrees with your opinion thinks the manager is bigger than the club. Yeah makes sense. This actually shows how limited your powers of perception are. Let me elaborate.

Did you know that Fergie went 3 seasons without winning a trophy when he first started at Man UTD? Are you saying they should have sacked him after season 3? Did the Man UTD board say that Fergie was bigger than Man UTD just because they stuck with him? I mean what kind of an idiotic comment is that. 3 seasons and no trophy with a manager who is proven has won it all OBVIOUSLY JUST NEEDS MORE TIME. You are so God damn spoilt with the recent success we've had that you think everyone should be expendable at the slightest dip in performance. This opinion of yours is overflowing with Ramires too. Sell him because he's had a shitty 6 months. Pathetic.

Its actually exactly the same. Your comment was: ""Three seasons without a trophy is unacceptable for Chelsea FC and he would definitely be gone way before that happens. Get your head out of his arse.""

I don't know why you're on +12 and the guy arguing with you is -15. This happens all the time in games. The ball is there to be kicked, in real-time it looks nowhere near as bad, and unless the whistle has long already blown there's nothing wrong with it. As it happens the ball doesn't go anywhere and it looks stupid, but there's no guarantee of that as he starts winding up to kick it. 

Plenty of times players fall on the ball and players try and kick it out from under them. So long as it's still in play, and you're kicking the ball and not booting a player on the ground, you'll rarely see even yellow cards for it, let alone reds. He gets the ball, makes zero contact with Sturridge, and he's not going in high, near the face/head, or with studs showing. Sure, if he'd missed it would have been a nasty kick to the player, but that applies to like pretty much any tackle. 

It's a friendly, which makes it really stupid and unnecessary (along with a lot of fouls in that game this evening), but if it was in a competitive game I don't think you'd see a card or even a foul drawn for that. Let alone a ""straight red, no doubt"". If the ball was near his ankles rather than his junk nobody would even care. Unless he misses the ball and kicks Studge in the ribs or his groin, there's not even any real risk that he's going to injure him and it's not particularly dangerous, just potentially painful for Danny (but actually not really because the ball probably serves as a fairly good cushion). Nobody would even bat an eyelid at this in a PL game unless there was a good two or three seconds between the whistle and the kick.

Can we not be the kind of sub that circle-jerks about how things like Sterling's foul on Valencia was not even a yellow and red was stupid, and then when it *is* our player it's suddenly a blatant red, just like the Mancs said we'd react if the situation was reversed?",0,1402185921,null,0,1402191849,0,ci1tkep,t3_27kto8,t1_ci1tkep,t1_ci1regy,null,1434139681,-17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-17

There have been a couple of times this season where Suarez has been fouled, gone down and clutched the ball, and the player has kicked the ball in Suarez's hands/body and absolutely nothing has happened as a result of that. If it's before or just as the whistle is blown for a foul it's totally fine so long as you're kicking ball and not player. Any 50/50 with a goalkeeper coming out to claim a ball and the striker goes in is similarly dangerous, if not more so because of the opposite momentum of each player, and you rarely see cards given for them even if they're pretty nasty, so long as studs weren't raised.

Or the time where a Swansea player [kicked the ball at RVP's head, well after the whistle had gone, and only got a yellow](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/9764264/Manchester-United-striker-Robin-van-Persie-could-have-been-killed-says-Alex-Ferguson-after-draw-with-Swansea.html) (and then didn't get a ban afaik).

Adults should be able to fully comprehend the sanctions given to them, but do the kids? What happens when the child isn't given his Â£2 to go buy lunch at school, do they starve, or go nick some other kids lunch/money?

When it comes down to it, it is impossible for a parent to control what their child does in school. I am sure that when we are all in school we skipped a few days and got into trouble without our parents ever finding out.

Punishing the parents is not the way to punish the children. Punishing the children is also not always the best option. I would like to think that rewarding good behavior is the more suitable option.

It is far more likely that she was always meant to be a new character for the 8th season, one that Doctor and Clara were to meet multiple times and it would lead up to the Time of the Doctor reveal in the Series 8 finale. Too bad for everyone involved that Matt Smith was done and was ready to do something else.

Tasha Lem didn't recognize Eleven's new body, implying that she knew him from before - this is backed by the Doctor stating she was an old friend.  

If Tasha really is River, and we know that River's timeline is traveling opposite the Doctor's, then the only way she wouldn't recognize Eleven is if she met him as Twelve - which couldn't have happened at that point because the Doctor was still destined to die as Eleven on Trenzalore.

From a continuity POV, the only reasonable way Tasha could be River is if she existed in that incarnation somewhere between being born and showing up as Mels in Let's Kill Hitler.  We know that she used her remaining regeneration energy to save the Doctor in that episode, and that she died in that incarnation in Forest of the Dead.  

From River's timeline, Tasha Lem could only have existed prior to Let's Kill Hitler, and this creates a ton of continuity issues.  River first learned to fly the TARDIS in that episode, yet Tasha was flying it in TotD.  Tasha would know that Eleven regenerated into Twelve, so River would have known that Eleven couldn't die at Lake Silencio.  Add to that the fact that would have known all about the Silents, and the Kovarian sect.

Looking at River's story overall versus cherry picking elements from a single episode really doesn't support the idea that Tasha is or was ever meant to be River.

All we see on the series is a snippet of his life - he has a history that we haven't seen and know nothing about.

1.  I don't think Lallana is quite a 5 on the BS meter.  Frankly I think Southampton just don't want to sell, but their actions regarding the potential transfer strike me as more stalling until after the world cup anticipating a stirring performance from Lallana.  Nothing to lose really, if Lallana shines his price goes up, if not, well, we'll take the $25 million you offered before.  In my opinion we won't see movement on Shaqiri or Lallana until after the World Cup, although if we want Shaqiri I sincerely hope I am wrong.  Admittedly I have never been too excited about Lallana, but that mostly arose from my vain hope that we would sign Rakitic, who apparently became enamored of the [comforts of Barca's bench](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/1686566.jpg).

2. Shaqiri is definitely more than 1 on the BS meter.  Nothing solid, only smoke.  Hope it happens before the world cup, as the Switzerland team is going to revolve around him and a good team performance will drive his price through the roof.

3.  Moreno is the most likely of the three targets to come to Liverpool, and sooner rather than later considering he will not feature in the world cup.  Clear interest from Liverpool, consistent links, and an indication from Sevilla that they are willing to sell.  Most likely player of the 3 to be at Liverpool next year (and the one I am most excited about - personal opinion, but I think if we get him he'll be the signing of the summer).

Fixed the quote for them. Housing bubbles create huge economic growth, as we also saw under Brown. Doesn't make him a financial genius though. We've gone from flatline growth to steady, pretty good growth, with an alarming trend towards unsustainable growth. It's pretty obvious what the cause of that is... 

The Tories austerity has just been code for ""slash departments that we want to make smaller"", the deficit hasn't been cut nearly as fast as they promised it would because it would have involved huge tax hikes. It's not really southern Europe style austerity where everything including the kitchen sink is cut and taxes got increased hugely.

Most of the properties used to be directly owned, but most of the stock was shifted to 'arms-length bodies' called 'housing associations'. These bodies own the property and act as landlords (often referred to as social landlords) and factors (maintenance managers), e.g. Glasgow HA is limited to Glasgow, whereas Cairn HA owns properties all over Scotland - these are just two examples, there are many others.

They are not free, they are just affordable. There has been a major shift in perception WRT social housing over the past 60 years: after the Second World War, council houses were highly desirable, as they were brand new and had stable, responsible landlords. This slowly shifted, as a number of council estates (areas of council housing built at the same time) became associated with deprivation and gang violence. Then came the 'right to buy' reform under Thatcher in the 1980s, which allowed council/HA tenants to buy their properties at a discount: this was in keeping with the widespread belief at the time that home ownership was superior. This created problems, as it remove the most desirable housing stock from the hands of the councils/HAs, meaning that social housing (and poorer tenants) were concentrated in less desirable areas.

true,KillMrFarage,cnty-england,Yorkshire!,"&gt;what you think about Scotland Independence (do they want it only to get off from EU? Who will be their king/ruler?)?

I'm not really bothered about the referendum if I'm brutally honest, if they don't become independent fine, if they do then that'd be a start for England to gain its independence from the UK which can only be a good thing. I find it annoying when complaints are made by some Scots that the UK Government 'doesn't fairly represent them' despite two of the last Three Prime Minsters in the country being Scottish. Oh and a man called Alex Salmond will be crowned king and Cersei Lannis-Nicola Sturgeon will be crowned Queen if a Yes vote comes to pass.

When you say 'UK Regions' it's really just more of English Regions like East of England, South West, Yorkshire &amp; Humber, North East England etc. Wales and Scotland are usually compared to these Regions as they're of comparable size roughly to the other countries. 

Northern Ireland is a result of the British Empire, I can't remember when but we went to Ireland and it was part of the UK but up until 1922 (I think) the Republic of Ireland became Independent as the 'Irish Free Sate' while Northern Ireland was to remain part of the UK for the protestants in Ireland who wanted Ireland to remain part of the UK. This is what's known as the 'partition of Ireland'. This pissed a lot of Irish people off and their was a civil war that erupted out of it, 'anti treaty' forces that wanted the whole of Ireland and 'Pro treaty' forces that were happy with the deal they were being offered, the 'anti treaty' forces knew that Britain suffered horrifying loses in the First World War and that if pissed off enough they'd re invade and potentially wipe out the Irish population. Anti treaty forces won.

Through the 60's to 90's is what's known as [The Troubles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles), I really don't want to go into detail because I'd be here all day so I'll just leave a link.

Yes, The Republic of Irelands government wants Northern Ireland but it's not exactly eager anymore and UK government isn't exactly jumping with joy to keep it either as the UK heavily subsidises N.Ireland.

This is ridiculous.

I don't know about the Suffolk site, but a rejected proposal on a slightly smaller scale in my borough was to be sited on low-grade agricultural land, the kind of plot that isn't particularly fertile or profitable anyway. 

As I understand it many other proposed solar farms are planned similarly in order to overcome local planning objections before they're even raised. To say that they would be built on valuable arable land is nonsense; far from all arable land is valuable and most has to be enriched with fertiliser to support modern industrial farming.

Solar farms are no more unsightly than conventional and nuclear plants like Dungeness (next to an AONB/SSSI in a shingle beach habitat almost unique in the world) or Drax.

&gt;To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic. (*1984*)

You are asking that people completely disregard objective reality in order to not hurt the feelings of men who say they are women. Humans are a sexual dimorphic species. There are males, and females. Males have XY chomosomes and produce sperm. Females have XX chomosomes and produce eggs. These are basic biological facts. 

If a man believes he is a woman he is suffering from a delusion. He says he ""feels like he was born in the wrong body"" - what exactly does that feel like? How can one possibly know what it's like to be in the right or wrong body? How can a man possibly know what it feels like to be a woman, if he isn't one? 

If he wants to, he can chose to put on a dress and get his genitals amputated, create a fuckhole, get silicone implants, take hormones. He may approximate the appearance of a woman, but he will never be a woman. All he is doing is mimicking a woman by altering his appearance and behaviour. If you dig up his body in a thousand years time archaeologists will take one look at his skeleton and declare he was a male. No amount of wishful thinking can change the fact that he has a male body.  

Frankly the idea that a woman is the sum of a pair of tits, a fuckhole, and a smearing of lipstick, is incredibly offensive to me. It's womanface, akin to blackface. And what's even more offensive is the fact that you would have me swallow this carefully constructed lie, and not just play along with the delusion, but *really believe it*, in order not to hurt their feelings.

&gt;

&gt;The __River Wharfe__ is a river in [Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire), England. For much of its length it is the county boundary between [West Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire) and [North Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yorkshire). The name Wharfe derives from the Old English 'weorf' or Old Norse 'hverfr' and means ""winding river"". 

&gt;The valley of the River Wharfe is known as [Wharfedale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharfedale). The river source is at [Beckermonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckermonds), [Langstrothdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langstrothdale) in the [Yorkshire Dales National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Dales_National_Park) and flows through [Kettlewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlewell), [Grassington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassington), [Bolton Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton_Abbey), [Addingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addingham), [Ilkley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkley), [Burley-in-Wharfedale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burley-in-Wharfedale), [Otley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otley), [Wetherby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetherby) and [Tadcaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadcaster). It then flows into the [River Ouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Ouse,_Yorkshire) near [Cawood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cawood,_North_Yorkshire). The section of the river from its source to around Addingham is known as Upper Wharfedale and has a very different character to the river downstream.

&gt;The river is approximately 97Â km long before it joins the River Ouse. It is a public navigation from the weir at Tadcaster to its junction with the River Ouse near Cawood and tidal from [Ulleskelf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulleskelf).

true,fozzy143,CupFinalsCrest,,"Firstly I completely agree with what you've said. Many of us had major doubts of Pellegrini at the start of the season, and even before that when Mancini was sacked. But now looking back over the last 2,3 years I don't think anyone can argue that it was absolutley the correct decision to remove Mancini for Pellegrini. Absolutely. Manuel in my mind has done everything asked of him and more for his first season in charge: Two trophies, respectable Champions League run, big scorelines, player improvement, some youth involvement (not as much as we'd hope, but I get the feeling next year will be more heavily youth focused [see below]) and finally he managed all this without causing a fuss, without any media attention and without loosing it. For a club of our size and stature that's a big achievement, though it's worth noting he was helped by other media shitstorms in other/the same city (Mourinho, Moyes, Steven Gerrard Gerrard etc.).  

Now for concerns:   

- He didn't win any of the very tough, big games:  

 - People can point to Munich away but I strongly believe Pellegrini fielded, in what his mind was, a weaker side against Munich and got lucky with the scoreline. Stand out performances from Milner and Silva helped but the game itself didn't feel like a big one, it didn't have the pressure or the nerves or the feeling of two titans colliding so I'm not going to count it. People could also point to Arsenal/Liverpool/Chelsea (FA Cup) at home but once again, all of them were at home, Arsenal and Liverpool performed terribly away from home against all the other top four sides. The one that deserves the most credit was the FA Cup win against Chelsea, it came at an important crossroads where our title credentials had be severely dented from the 0-1 to the Mourinho a week before and by winning it we certainly put ourselves back in the running. But the matter of the fact is we lost against Chelsea both times it really mattered in the league. Sloppy seconds aren't good enough for Manchester City. Under Mancini in the league games I feel felt confident whereever we went or whoever we faced. Chelsea away? No problem. Liverpool away? I'll take a draw but we can win it. Arsenal away? Maybe we can rest a few. Mancini got his tactics right, he had the team tightly drilled and capable of winning any game. Pellegrini hasn't so far.  

- [In Ferran Soriano's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzkRGvL0VNY#t=1999)  (that I highly recommend you watch) he mentions two leadership styles: Direct and Delegation/Coaching. For me Pellegrini falls into that second catagory and Soriano discusses (far better than I could) why the Delegation/Coaching style of managment often fails once you've won. Could Pellegrini suffer from the lackluster second season? Very probably. he's going to have to find a way to reinvigorate and motivate the team. Usually you can do this by either signing new players, bringing in a new Manager, sticking with your current Hard-as-nails Manager or bring through some young players. Now we know we're going to have a relatively quite transfer window (Sagna, Fernando and Mr C.B. are hardly going to revolutionise Manchester City), we know Pellegrini's going to keep his job and I don't think Pellegrini is like Capello, Mancini, Mourinho, I don't think he has the style to keep a team winning over many years (though I'd love to be proved wrong). This leaves the best option as bringing through the youth players, putting some fresh blood on the bench in order to motivate and scare everyone else. Though credit where credit's due he has made the tough decisions this year when he dropped Hart and stuck with Demichelis despite all the media criticisms.  

Overall: I'll lower your 9.5 to just a 9 based on my comment about him not winning the big games, but if he can prove me wrong next year by showing his claws then I think we might have found someone special.

Putting solar on supermarket and factory roofs, and the like, is fine, but even if we did that on every square inch, it would provide nowhere near enough energy. Solar on domestic roofs is too expensive and also quite limited in scale. Recall the recent statistic which said Britain has more acreage allotted to golf courses than to physical house floor space. Utility scale and commercial scale solar is still quite expensive, but it consistently reduces in cost by 8% a year, and will probably be competitive with conventional generation in Britain within about 10-15 years.

Similarly, the compromise position on wind is putting them out at sea, but whereas onshore wind costs the same or a little more per unit electricity than nuclear, coal and gas, offshore costs double, and a lot of those costs are inherent and unavoidable material costs from building enormous foundations to withstand the sea.

It does make you wonder how many alternative technologies we want to develop before we find one which is acceptable.

It is very strange that you admire Nigel Farage and UKIP, considering you are the kind of person that the movement is based around disliking, I suppose you can support whoever you like but it seems deeply ironic to me. 

On Northern Island, it is in the UK because Ireland was formerly occupied by the British Empire, albeit in theory integrated into the UK rather than a territory. After the war of independence, the northern part of Ireland voted to remain in the UK. Ireland definitely wants it back, you would be hard pressed to find an Irish person from the Republic who doesn't want a unified Irish nation. However in the north of Ireland there are many Irish people who would prefer to remain within the UK, and conflict between these two groups has been a cause of bother for many years (massive understatement). British views on the Irish are mixed, there is definitely still an anti-Irish sentiment held by some people, and from time to time one will hear jokes about the  Irish. I personally view the Irish as kin, but my grandparents were Irish immigrants so I am bias in that regard.

As far as regional stereotypes go, the most important one to be aware of for you is the Yorkshire/Lancashire rivalry, which is not especially serious but does manifest in sporting events and the odd joke. It is derived from the time of the War of the Roses. As far as learning about British culture, the problem you will have is that when you read something about it, the focus will be on upper class culture in the south (like which spoon to use and how to formally greet royalty and so on), which doesn't really apply to most people here. The book ""Watching the English"" by Kate Fox is perhaps worth a read but it does generalise a lot.

true,amongthewolves,lfc99,,"Lallana maybe inexperienced in regards to never playing Champions League football, but I think Rodgers clearly sees he has talent and his mentality is solid. You have to remember that Southampton were in League One and Lallana has helped the Saints through two promotions into the Premiership, and has captained the club for two seasons now. It's not the same as Champions League though? Yes, that's correct. But looks at where he is now, he's in the England national team based on merit.

With respect to his transfer to Liverpool, we made it abundantly clear of his valuation and have not only met but exceeded it as well. Southampton are being raided of their best players and it makes sense that they want to keep their captain and maintain their position in the Premiership. Premiership = $$$. It's in Lallana's court now to make a transfer request if he's adamant about progressing to the next level and playing continental football with us. Rodgers and FSG know damn well not to overspend on players, given their past mistakes.

I think we'll wait until the end of the World Cup to see what Lallana will do. If we can't pry him away from St. Mary's, then we have other targets who are willing to join us now and have Champions League experience as well.

The rest were clearly to add depth. Aspas is the only signing that we can really call a failure right now. Kolo was a bargain and brings experience to the dressing room and Sahko has had an inexperienced LB to deal with all year.

This summer is the summer where Rodgers' spending will truly be judged as we can now focus on atracting start quality to improve the first team directly but we know far too little right now to actually judge it either way other than the fact that Rodgers has taken us from 7th to 2nd in his short time here.",0,1402225386,null,0,false,0,ci23qon,t3_27m0bv,t1_ci23qon,t1_ci23nxj,null,1434144542,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

To say Allen, Sakho and Borini have no chance of getting our money back if they were to be sold, I think is a bit harsh. 

Allen is a good, talented midfielder. He may not be world class, but I think he has done well overall. He's dependable and perfect to have in the squad. His value certainly won't of gone down. 
Borini was expensive I guess, but he's young and if he can get over 10 goals as a second option striker at Lfc his value will probably go up.

Sakho is potentially Frances future captain, who had  good first season   - once the rough edges of his game have been polished a little he will be immense. 

I think with all of these transfers there has been an element of risk, gambling slightly on future improvements rather than buying the finished product,  but don't forget that this was really the only way Rodgers could get players - world class players werent exactly falling over themselves to join us.

Now we have champions league we can aim for players that are good now, and not in  few years. Getting linked to (and hopefully buying) players like shaquiri  and moreno  is testament to how we have improved. 
Now we can offer the chance to play fucking awesome football as well- I think it must be genuinely appealing to join Lfc now if you're a pro.

You can find a blogger with your skin type/shade/undertone and see what they like/recommend, look up reviews and swatches (Makeupalley is pretty good, but they are US-centric) and look up tutorials on how to pick out foundations best suited for you (the Lisa Eldridge series, or Wayne Goss, etc.).

true,ddster23,lfc99,,"You have a valid argument, but many of the points made are shallow and don't dig deeper into why Rodgers signed these players or why he let them go. 

Starting with Assaidi. He was signed in the time when Rodgers said ""A team needs 75+ goals to be a squad challenging for the Champions league, we were nowhere near that, but we will work towards that."" He saw Assaidi, who had a great goal scoring to price ratio. He knew that he wouldn't be a long-term signing. He simply doesn't fit in Rodgers system, Assaidi is a natural winger that doesn't adapt well to the style of football Rodgers likes to play. He is a player that fits perfectly into a squad like West Ham or Stoke which is why he would be much more valuable there. It was smart to let him go, because he won't be valuable to us, it would be miles better to have Ibe playing rather than Assaidi.

Next, Allen. He was injured with a shoulder injury for much of the season and forced himself to play which set him back even farther than expected. He's not the type of player that will come in and score two goals, he is the same type of player that Busquets is to Barcelona. If you haven't watched the Busquest's Importance Barcelona video, you should give it a watch, only a few minutes of deep analysis. He sets the tempo of the game, and ontop of that he has the work-ethic of an animal. The guy is 24, he's the type of player, if on another team, would shut down Liverpool's first 20-25 minute rampages that we saw so often this season. He'll be key next season in games against teams that play a more fast-paced game.

""The Iberian Trio."" You were correct here, for the most part. Aspas was a disaster and easily Rodgers worst signing. I would love so much to see him thrive, but it simply isn't happening. Borini is ahead of him, and now we have Lambert that is even better. I truly believe we bought Alberto and tried to send him out on loan right after the purchase but failed to do so. He was no where near ready to play in the Premier League. He hasn't grown up in England like Sterling Henderson, Ibe, etc, that are in the team at similar ages to him. The loan move to Malaga this summer is more than ideal, we will see him given playing time and next year I expect him to be loaned out to a PL side. 

Moses was an absolute disaster, and there is no manager that can be at fault for that. There simply isn't anything you can do when a player who won AFCON Player of the Tournament completely gives up and sits on the pitch and picks flowers. There's no one to blame there except the player himself, he can go fuck himself is all I have to say.

Sahin. The main thing to say here is, just because a player is good doesn't mean he's good for every team. Sahin was a player that wouldn't fit well into any PL side. His style of play flourishes in the Bundesliga style of football, but is crushed in the PL style. If you recall, every time he was given the ball, he would be shoved off the ball. He's unable to play in fast-paced, high-pressure games which English football is notorious for. He needs space and time to show what he can do.

Lastly, if you're saying Sturridge and Coutinho were the only players that provide decent return for their money, you're absolutely mad. Sturridge and Coutinho are signings that repaid their costs two-fold. They blew all expectations and flourished under Rodgers, and set the bar at the highest rung. Now after that, normal supporters that don't take time to look at things holistically will compare the following signings and expect them 10 million pound signings to play like 25 million pound signings. At the beginning of the season Rodgers talked about how Keepers are evaluated by the amount of points they earn their club. His goal was to average 2 points per game, and he did that, and in the first half of the season Mignolet was to thank for that. He, himself, has saved us 4 points, and for his price tag that is MUCH more than worth it. It's hard to judge CB's this seasons due to injury and lack of consistent pairing. Just watch next season, Sakho will be our second best if not best defender, I guarantee you that.

true,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"First I want to say thanks for the discussion.  

What you don't see is that this is how the business works. No club has a huge success rate on transfers. Especially clubs that were out of Europe and looking to make shrewd purchases, you end up with promising buys that either flop or rise. 

I also don't understand the negativity really. You could have said half this stuff about Henderson after his first season, same with Lucas. If this season shows anything it's that our players can play better than we thought. 

I also think you're being very premature and not realizing that many of these players were bought young as investments. Alberto, Ilori, and Borini all have plenty of time to develop. And Borini looks to be doing just that. Meanwhile while Allen hasn't been Xavi esque, anyone who expected that from him was being a bit deluded. He has fit into the squad well and clearly BR is getting what he wants out of him. He has had good performances and is an extremely versatile utility player in midfield. 

Of course you'll get poor buys like Aspas. And I would much rather have a few poor buys then an Andy Carroll situation again. But those buys come with the players who succeed. Sturridge, Coutinho, and Sakho have been fantastic purchases IMO that make players like Aspas worth it and then some. 

Oh and on the loan point, I think Brendan recognizes that loans can help when we are scrapped for depth, but also realizes it is good to have a solid team core. And as an aside on Sahin, of course he's a good player, but the question you need to ask is is he a good player for our system (similar to Fabregas at Barca). And the answer was no, not with Gerrard on the pitch. So I wouldn't blame that on Brendan at all, shit happens.

The problem is though, you are most likely on a low income, and the houses (this one built 20 years ago) were built so cheaply and poorly, that you have to do constant repairs/touching up. And to get it to any kind of decent basic standard, it would cost me thousands upon thousands to do it. Because of everything would need removing, floors, walls(hollow walls) door frames, windows. and replacing with better quality stuff. The floors are just crummy old flat particle board sheets, put on beams that are not level to begin, so every room has a slant, and the floors creak. want carpet/vynal/tiles? you need to fix the floor first, and pay for it yourself. because fuck you.

 The rendering on the walls grows new cracks every few months. patching it up and painting regularly, is fucking futile. The walls that are not brick, are paper thin(seriously they are about 4 inches thick). with no insulation. So you can hear a pin drop in any room in the house. great when you share the living space. ..

Every thing springs a leak, regularly. everything that is supposed to work, breaks regularly. And god forbid should you call your landlord to send around their contractors to fix anything...these People seem to be on day release from broadmoor, and have no fucking clue what they are doing. They end up in an endless cycle of, 'fixing' something, only for it to break in ten minutes, so they send another person who complains about the cowboys and 'fixes' it correctly, only for it to break in a few hours, so they send another person who complains about the 'cowboys'..ad infinitum. until you hire someone to fix it yourself.  
And thats only if you are lucky, a lot of the times they will steal from you, or deliberately damage your house (like huge chunks of plaster from the walls while carrying a small toolbox.., unscrewing water drains so they flood the floor, even though they were not even working on the water system), treading oily boots through your carpet, that you worked and saved for.(for wich they tell you they will send a professional cleaner around to fix...nope, they will say *anything* to get you to shut up, because fuck you). 

So you end up using all your spare, money constantly patching up a piece of shit house. That still looks like shit, because you can't afford to replace everything and do it correctly. even if you did, you could get kicked out for arbitrary reasons.. even though all your neighbours are scum bags, and alcoholics, drug dealers,  and kiddy fiddlers. but somehow are a protected species, left alone to do whatever they want not only by the council but by the police too.

true,archon88,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"&gt; UKIP have an MEP in Scotland so it isn't this left wing paradise that you'd like to think it is.

I went to the hustings in Glasgow and listened to him (Coburn). He's a clown, and he got about 10% of the vote, in an election with very low turnout. He's representative of Scottish politics in roughtly the same way that Nick Griffin is representative of English politics.

&gt; discredit those of opposing views.

I wouldn't necessarily describe the Tories like that, much as I disagree with them. The problem with UKIP is that they're kind of like a clone of the Monster Raving Looney party that got itself taken seriously. Their understanding of energy, economics, environmentalism, science, health, etc. is close to zero. Again, please put the future of the country in the hands of experts, or at least people with some understanding, not these jokers.

&gt; wishing to regain your own sovereignty and have full control over your own affairs

Is that really what Westminster offers? The UK has never enthusiastically supported the project of European integration, so this latest pretense that the existence of the European Union is unbearable, is completely absurd and hypocritical. I'm hardly uncritical of the EU myself &amp;ndash; at its worst, it's little better than a mouthpiece of neoliberal dogma (the TTIP is a case in point). My problem is that the UKIP criticism isn't intelligent, it doesn't come from a progressive standpoint, and much of it is in bad faith (their MEPs end up getting paid for a job they don't do, which is emblematic of the waste they claim the EU promotes).

&gt; Microscopic Scotlanders

The SNP isn't isolationist and it does not want to pretend that Scotland is a precious little jewel that needs to be safeguarded from the evils of the Continent. The analogy doesn't really work. It's not the size of the country that matters; it's the size of the vision.

&gt; Also, /r/Scotland is hivemind cesspit where anything other than pro independence dogma is upvoted. 

I guess you meant downvoted. Perhaps this is because many Scots would like to ""regain their own sovereignty and have full control over their own affairs""?

No. Closest thing is a 16-25 railcard (assuming that that's your age range). Saves a third off most rail fares, but it costs about Â£30 to buy. Perhaps slightly cheaper online if you buy online with a promo code (unsure if you'd need to use a UK address if buying online, but no issues buying in a train station). 


Yes they're expensive. Â£40 for that trip (276 miles, not 400) isn't too bad considering most advance fares (i.e. the cheap ones) go on sale 12 weeks in advance and in summer they go quickly. The last train of the day to Newcastle is usually the cheapest, but it gets into Newcastle at about 1am. 

Get the bus if it's too much. National Express and Megabus are the two companies that'll cover your route. British Airways and Easyjet also fly from Heathrow and Gatwick respectively to Newcastle. I've been paying Â£22.99 for my Easyjet Gatwick to Newcastle flights. BA is usually around Â£50 booked early enough.



Also, if you weren't already, your best bet is to book using the actually train companies websites, not a middle man like The Trainline. You want East Coast for the Newcastle trip and Virgin Trains for the Carlisle trip.

Although I twisted those forks and partly bent part of the frame during an accident and had to replace them. 

I could do nearly all the repair work myself but for example busting a wheel was near Â£100 out the bank. I used to do maintain it constantly replacing bearings when they needed to and it just got far too much in time and money. Right now I'd much prefer a bike that would let me ride long distance. In the end I think the only stock part on that bike is the frame/stem/cranks and handlebars even the bottom bracket had to be replaced at one point.

Which brings me onto a tip, If you do do this. I recommend on bikes that allow it you should offer a 'service' where you remove the bottom bracket and slip in a sealed note (waterproof of course) containing the owner/address/contact detailed. Slip it in between the gap between the BB and frame and seal it back up. That way if their bike ever gets stolen they have proof inside the bike that it is theirs. It's fairly simple to do and it's rather unique (for a business to do) and is actually 'fairly' common thing for cyclists to do with high end bikes. All you need to do is pop the cranks off and unscrew the BB, you just have to be careful not to screw the threads on the frame but shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes.",0,1402231767,null,0,1402231948,0,ci24tgk,t3_27k7g8,t1_ci24tgk,t1_ci24lwk,null,1434145051,1,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,1

He came back from injury and clearly lost a yard of pace and weren't sharp. 

Moses and Cissokho to me weren't Rodgers signings. They don't fit in with the ideology of a Rodgers team. Their first touches are terrible and they have zero technique. We had a wafer thin squad last season, so it might explain a lot of players being brought in to bring the numbers up.

We have a tremendous starting eleven. Time to build a better squad this year and go again. Assaidi to me strikes me as a stop gap player. A player you bring in with a small fee, see if you can get a tune out of him then sell him on.

Rodgers has been brilliant in the sense that he's came in and got the wage bill down. Liverpool would be seen as a team were players could turn up after a few good seasons elsewhere, get a big contract and that's it. Now players get big incentive based contracts which I completely agree with. Exactly the reason why we're trying to get Johnson to take a pay cut if he wants to stay.

If you look at measurable violent crime such as robbery, rape, murder - the UK is consistently lower. We are a much less violent place than the UK.

I actually don't think guns have to do with it. It's more like the UK has less poverty, less gang wars, less racial tension, less large cities, a different style of policing, but most importantly a TOTALLY different social attitude. 

There are 2 million guns legally owned by normal people in the UK - yet a tiny, tiny amount of gun crime. We are far from being a gun-free country like much of the world (and many British people) falsely believe. But the thing is, even when British people have guns, we don't tend to use them in crimes. Handguns were not banned in the UK until the 90's, but even before the ban our ownership rates were very low. And if you look at gun murders before and after the ban, they haven't really changed. You could argue that the ban has stopped more murders - maybe that's true. But it's also true that there was no significant reduction in gun murders after the ban either.

The Single Market and competition rules make it only a matter of time until before the NHS falls to the pressure of private insurance.  Other models need access and to be allowed to compete under a single market - but the NHS model has been rather unique maintaining free service at the point of use.  

We saw a similar breakdown with the postal directives and the Royal Mail; now the NHS already has the WHD and the EU Clinical Trials Drirectives chipping away at it.

You may like the NHS.  I like the NHS, and I'm certainly glad they came through for you - but the supranational group you're thanking for NHS, the EU, is the very organisation that threatens it.

It's factually correct that black people are disproportionately the victims and the shooters in gun murders in the UK. It is not racist to state that fact. It would only be racist if somebody said the shooters are violent BECAUSE they are black, or that black people are more violent. It's pretty sad that you ignore the problem or dismiss it as simply racism.

See the FBIs own information: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expanded-homicide-data

&gt;Concerning murder **victims** for whom race was known, 50.0 percent were black, 46.0 percent were white, and 2.6 percent were of other races.  Race was unknown for 175 victims.

and

&gt;Of the **offenders** for whom race was known, 52.4 percent were black, 45.2 percent were white, and 2.4 percent were of other races.  The race was unknown for 4,077 

If you look at the full data here: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-2 you will see that the single highest demographic for gun murder is black males between 20 and 24 years old. The second highest is black males 25-29. 

For reference, black people comprise around 15% of the US population, so it is VERY disproportionate that they are the offender or victim in half of murders. 

Another source - the bureau for criminal justice - http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4863

&gt;The average homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than the rate for whites.

That's a fairly sad and despicable statistic. So yeah, gang culture involving black people certainly is a factor in the high gun murder rate in the US. And it's not racist to say that. You really shouldn't misuse the term racist - it's like the boy who cried wolf, and you actually contribute to shutting out reasonable discussion of facts because people are too scared of being labeled racist.

true,flapjackcarl,lfc99,,"I see where you're coming from, but I think the main thing you're missing is that he was operating in a market in which he was severely limited for options. If you can believe the rumors over the past couple of transfer windows, we were in for some great players (Mkhitaryen, Willian, and Costa) and probably a few others as well. The issue is, they didn't want to come to liverpool. Rodgers tried to sign those world class players, and they didn't want to come. And who is to blame them? 2 seasons ago we were completely lost, playing with no true style and with no direction forward. We did not look like a team triumphantly charging to a champions league berth. We looked like a team that was heading towards mediocrity. 

Rodgers has come in and changed all of that. He's maybe two incredible buys (Sturridge and Coutinho for a grand total of 20 million pounds, now probably worth at least 50, maybe more). He's also performed a minor miracle with henderson (under dalglish, he was played as a winger and did nothing but sprint up and down the field. He was hardly involved in build up and looked lost as to what his purpose was on the field). Now, Henderson is one of the most important players in our team, with his work ethic, pressing, and passing enabling us to play the high pressure attacking style we play. He's also continued to develop sterling making him the most promising young english talent playing today.

That's the great. Now for the good.
Sakho: He was very expensive, but he's still a huge talent. Keep in mind he's very young, especially for a centerback, a position that tends to take more time for a player to grow into. I think Sakho will be at the club for a long time to come, and I think he'll be come a vital part of our team next season. He has the ability to be the vocal leader in defense we've been missing since carragher retired, and that value cannot be understated.
Kolo: What to say about Kolo, before he made several terrible errors, he was a great part of our defense. He led the team, played well, and made us laugh and smile for the low low price of 0 pounds (excluding wages). He's also a valuable personality to have in a squad full of young inexperienced players. A very astute signing in my opinion
Allen: In the first half of the 2012 season, and the end of last season, Allen showed exactly why he was brought in. He's the sort of player that doesn't obviously improve the team by contributing goals or assists, but he's very valuable in more intangible ways. I saw him compared to busquets somewhere in here, and that's a great comparison. He presses hard, intercepts the ball, and recycles possession. Did we pay a bit over the odds for him? Yes, but at the beginning of last season he looked every bit a 15 million pound player.
Assaidi: yes, I'm including him here. He was brought in for 3 million, pennies in todays market. He was a gamble that never made an impact, but if you believe the rumors, we may be selling him for more than we paid for him. Not bad business in my book.
Borini: He still has a great chance to make an impact at liverpool. He proved his worth at sunderland last season, helping them make a remarkable comeback to stay up. He still has more to prove IMO, but I think he's a useful player to have.d
The undetermined: Aspas/Alberto/Llori. It's tough to call on these. Aspas has been a flop, and i genuinely feel for him. He's had limited opportunities to prove his worth. I think he's a better player than we've seen, but sadly I think his time in Liverpool is done. Alberto and Llori still have a great shot to make it at the club, they simply need time to mature. Only time will tell with them. 
The bad: Moses/Cissokho. I put these in the bad, because Moses was utterly useless, and Aly just never proved his worth (although he was a capable defender). But they were LOANS. thats the purpose, you try before you buy. We wasted some wages, yes, but they could have added tremendous value for no cost.

All in all, I think rodgers has done quite well given the limitations he's had to work within, and I think we could easily recoup that 100 million spent if we were to sell all of these players. And in 2 years, we'd likely profit on the expenditure. ",0,1402235012,null,0,false,0,ci25jhc,t3_27m0bv,t1_ci25jhc,t3_27m0bv,null,1434145390,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Im not saying it's definitely gonna happen, but the fact remains that Real  Madrid are mad bastards with a fat checkbook and fans that are fickle as fuck.

Also try 'split ticketing' it can be time consuming but you can save a LOT by doing it. For example i recently tried to book a train from Manchester airport to Sheffield, quoted me Â£25. When I booked the tickets separately ie man air to man pic to Sheff the price dropped to Â£8.  This article on money saving expert probably explains it a lot better.

Of course Muslims will raise their children as Muslim, that's how religion works. It seems silly to say that it makes them ""separate"" to the rest of the country, unless they go fundamentalist with it. Newsflash: Not everyone is atheist, this country is made up of many religious groups. 

Getting back to the actual issue here, the problem with schools like this is these are state school that are obviously trying to give children an ""Islamic"" education, likely with some approval from parents. That is wrong, state schools need to move away from religion especially when it's a group of nutty Islamists who are trying to influence other schools and forcing out non-muslim headteachers.

When you include wages, Allen really isn't that expensive because he's on relatively low wages for someone who cost 15m.

Specifically, Sakho is off game pace of the premier league and is occasionally caught out of position or a step behind the play, but he's also transitioned from Ligue 1, so give him time to adapt. He's also a physical monster, fantastic in the air, and our strongest tackler and in 1 on 1 battles. I think he'll prove to be a good buy in a couple years, and can see him being a centreback for the long term.

Allen has shown this season that he can come on and change the game. He's been fantastic as a substitute in many games, and is absolutely brilliant as squad depth and an occasional starter. He's fantastic at keeping possession and breaking up play, and once he gets better at pushing forward and finishing his chances, he'll get a lot more plaudits.

Borini looks to be a good player, and he's young. He'll improve and he's had an impressive season at Sunderland. I think we should hold out on judgement until he's back at anfield showing us what he can do.

true,Wolfgang_Wolf,null,null,"Firstly, as has been stated already, ice hockey in the UK is not split up in terms of organisation into the home nations, so it is hard to compare Scotland on its own to other countries.

Scotland is actually one of the strongest regions in the UK in terms of ice hockey, with 4 out of 10 teams in the Elite League (Dundee, Edinburgh, Fife and Braehead) being Scottish. In addition, the only two British-trained players to have been drafted by an NHL team (Tony Hand and Colin Shields) are Scottish. Tony Hand is considered to be the greatest British-trained ice hockey player ever.

However, that last paragraph was all in the context of British ice hockey, so in an international context, this is not great. Because of a lack of reliable natural ice in any area apart from possibly some remote, sparsely populated corners of the Highlands, ice hockey in Scotland does not have a natural advantage over the the rest of the UK. So like the rest of the UK, ice hockey has to be played in indoor rinks, which are scarce and expensive to use. There are whole host of other issues hampering the growth of British ice hockey, but I don't fancy writing a whole essay about it right now.

In your hypothetical, the Bank of England has banks loaning to one another at X%, the government too can therefore borrow on a short-term basis for X%, people however believe the government has too much debt and so they decide they want to exchange out of Pounds into something else.

Thing is, and I'm going to borrow a quote here: *'Runs' on currencies in a floating rate system can only really happen if there is a patsy taking the other side trying to defend a peg either by intervention or with interest rates. As Mike Norman points out without that the speculators are just fighting amongst themselves.*

If you don't have a patsy trying to hold it up (eg the UK through much of its pegged-pound history), rates quickly find an equilibrium where everyone's happy once more. They don't keep on falling as for every unit they fall, someone else is finding UK exports more appealing, UK's looking a cheaper place for foreigners to invest, fewer imports are being purchased, etc.

There's just no mechanism by which it can free-fall ""causing crippling inflation"", which is why that does not/has not happened as a consequence to a government borrowing too much of its own free-floating currency, not even in Japan.

You're concerned over an unprecedented hypothetical that doesn't really make sense, basically.

The effect of HRT is far reaching, it even extends to changes in vision (this topic is really interesting); turns out the eye uses two key depth cues - ""motion parallax"" and ""shape-from-shading"", and biological men are significantly more likely to prioritize motion parallax while biological women rely more heavily on shape-from-shading. [Here's a fascinating article about how the 3D virtual reality systems in the Oculus Rift using motion parallax over shape-from-shading made women sick when they tried to use it](http://qz.com/192874/is-the-oculus-rift-designed-to-be-sexist/#/).

Bone structure differences are quite dependent on when the individual starts hormone replacement therapy, if it's prior to or early in puberty their bone structure would be (to my understanding) identical to that of the sex they're transitioning to. Up to ~25 years of age, prior to epiphyseal closure, I believe the differences would be quite small as only some bones would be affected to a limited extent. After that the width/size of some bones might be typically masculine (or feminine in the case of trans men), but details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens. HRT would prevent such changes from developing any further (or allow them to take place).

No bullshit.  No problem.  Works perfectly well when recruiting doctors from India or nurses from Malaysia, for example.   We simply recruit.   

https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/advice/overseas_cand.html

In fact, being part of the EU means that it makes it more difficult to recruit from outside the EU, and by being obliged to recruit from the EU first can actually mean recruiting the person less skilled or qualified.

Far better to improve our own level of teaching for medical professionals by dropping out of the EU and the WHD, and then to extend the same immigration/work visas policy to all medical professionals wherever they may come from, inside or outside the EU, based purely on skill and experience, and to recruit the best wherever they come from.

If for example it was a choice between a top 10% in their class candidate from the top Bulgarian medical university, or a top 10% in their class candidate from the top Australian, Indian or Canadian universities, I'd hate to think that the Canadian, Indian and Australian aren't on a level playing field to the Bulgarian.  If not at least on the simple ground that their experience of working in a health system and the expectations placed on them will be much higher and in line with what we already have than compared to a comparatively poor and still developing Bulgarian system.  From skill set alone there is a reason to recruit from developed countries or where they have completed their education in English based on a UK model.

Doctors and nurses from within the EU that can compete with those outside the EU would be just as recruitable by the NHS if weren't part of the EU.  We'd just have higher standards and a fairer, more equal system.

Costa has just earned a Â£30m+ move to Chelsea, Immobile has been signed by Dortmund. The other three are the top 3 players in the world right now. That is the company he is in. The kind of company Rooney has not been in with for a while. 

This England team should be built around Sturridge, he is England's best player right now. Yesterday yes he missed his chances, but his ability and movement was obviously on a different level. Missing a chance or two happens to every striker, remember his game vs Arsenal away? He responded to that with a brace vs Swansea.

With Liverpool we move our entire formation around to get the best of SAS, and we justify it in the goals and the direct link up play. It was evident from the very first game they played together (Norwich at home with [that](http://youtu.be/fc0e4dJ6zEY?t=1m24s) dummy). There hasn't been anything to suggest that it is worth compromising the midfield to include Rooney in his favoured position, either from Rooney's performances or his partnership with Sturridge.

Instead we should play a 4-3-3, this is beneficial to Sturridge, Hendo, Gerrard, Wilshere or Barkley and is the perfect counter attacking set up for Italy. England played a 4-3-3 for most of the qualifying campaign and then just before the tournament we switch to a 4-2-3-1 because Sturridge deserves to play and Rooney just has to play.

United fans always point to stats but anyone can see from watching Rooney that he is poor as a traditional no.10, he plays as a second striker which means he doesn't help the midfield (which England cannot afford). He is not creative, he never plays neat one twos (Barkley did it within 2 minutes of coming on yesterday by contrast). Sure he has a decent amount of goals and assists (mostly from set pieces) but even when he scored 30+ for United he never performed for England when it mattered.

Chadli just takes up space on the pitch. He's quicker and better defensively than siggy but not enough that he should play in front of him. For those of u saying that a player needs to be more than just goals, the game is about points and we have few players able to hit game winners these days.

To better understand human nature and as a by-product reconsider unfounded and harmful views.

&gt;Males have XY chomosomes and produce sperm. Females have XX chomosomes and produce eggs. These are basic biological facts.

Wrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXY), wrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility) and wrong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_infertility).

&gt;If a man believes he is a woman he is suffering from a delusion.

This isn't true. Highly experienced medical professionals - psychiatrists and psychologists - disagree. The scientific consensus is that transsexuals are not mentally ill. They have a much better understanding of the topic than you or I, who are we to question that?

&gt;If you dig up his body in a thousand years time archaeologists will take one look at his skeleton and declare he was a male.

Incorrect, especially if the individual started hormone replacement therapy at a young age. If it was before/during puberty there would be nothing from the skeleton to suggest they weren't female (or male, trans men exist too). Up to ~25 years of age, prior to epiphyseal closure, I believe it would be very ambiguous as only some bones would be affected to a limited extent. After that the width/size of some bones might be typically masculine (or feminine in the case of trans men), but details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens. HRT would prevent such changes from developing any further (or allow them to take place).

PRP a feature of New Labour policy across the board. Blair was amongst the foremost advocates of New Public Management, which implemented PRP in as many areas as New Labour saw fit. It leads exactly to what you're saying. More generally, it is teaching kids to pass exams rather than actually learn. Its also a feature of Higher Education; many universities receive funding per graduate, which encourages them to pass students regardless of how smart, dumb or interested they are.

I agree your brother's viewpoint and that of those teacher's he says have quit because of it. It clearly rewards all the wrong things. Quantity of over quality unfortunately seems to be where New Labour and now Gove are headed.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;As I've said there DEFINITELY WOULD BE LESS EU doctors if there were visas. Getting a visa is not like buying a ticket for a plane!!!

It is if you have a sponsor, because the sponsor does all the running, even paying for or acquiring the visas before hand.  And the NHS is the UKs largest employer, so getting a visa through the NHS if they want you to work for them will be a doddle.  Hell, if you have a sponsor, they'll probably even pay for the flight.

And, oh look, that Guardian pdf shows that plenty of people run this particular gauntlet from outside the EU already.  When looking at where non-UK doctors trained you have to go down to position #5 before you come to an EU country. 

The UK could offer visas to whoever it wanted.  The NHS could recruit from wherever they wanted.  Recruiting outside the EU would not be a problem.

&gt;Yeah, nice to pick up the poorest EU country, out of the 27 there are, just to make some kind of a point.

Well, of course, I was making a point, but it's a valid point.  

We have a poor country, with poor levels of training and experience, but its trainees are given priority.  Put everybody on a workvisa and the best wanting to come to the UK to work in the NHS will still be able to come whilst we have vacancies.

&gt;And to tell you something, which you, a typically ignorant person doesn't know about, it is often that in least expectable place something major can come out. For example, I'm from Poland and whether you believe me or not, Polish medical system and their doctors are often much more capable than the British ones. 

Then we shall buy what we want and recruit what we need.  And they shall come.  And if that means we end up recruiting more Polish doctors, nurses or emergency responders, then great.  Don't have to be part of the EU for that.

What we won't be doing is going down EU liberalisation which is already affecting medical trials and the level of training for doctors, which is already leading the NHS further to privatisation.  We can keep the NHS and raise standards.

We most certainly don't need to be part of the EU to allow the NHS to effectively recruit professionals on visas.

In that example, we are in contact with the IOC and the IOC is usually co-ordinating, as it represents all the sports.

I mean - every single benchmark people have given, from 100% of GDP, 150% of GDP, 200% of GDP, quadrillion yen of debt has just come and gone. At what level of government debt do currencies spontaneously explode?

&gt; you airily say 'people find uk export more appealing' but that export capacity doesn't exist to be instantly switched on and the UK imports many staple items which cannot just be switched off

The value of the pound's continuously changing according to people and foreigner's desires to hold it, and to use it to purchase exports/imports. It's how floating currencies work. Some factors work to push the value up (foreign investment, exports, foreign savings in pounds), some factors work to push it down (investment abroad, imports, domestic savings in foreign currencies/foreigners dissaving pounds), with the exchange rate floating to find an equilibrium value.

&gt; At the core of your argument seems to be that that a national govt can spend 200% (or any amount) more that it's income year on year to infinity while suffering no ill effects, does that sound plausible?

Of course not. **All** governments are constrained in their spending by what their economy can actually produce, irrespective of how it's funded.

That is, it doesn't matter if the government confiscates a vault from a drug ring that has a trillion pounds in it and tries to spend that, or if it prints it, or if it borrows it, taxes it, or if it's spending pounds that it's saved via past surpluses - if in any given year the government attempts to push demand past what the economy can actually support, the **only** possible outcome can be inflation and/or shortages. This is true for **all** governments.

It's why Norway doesn't lower taxes today for instance - not because they ""don't have the money"", but because they're concerned that with the economy already fully employed, doing so could only serve to bid up prices ie cause inflation.

So whilst *debt* isn't a concern, each individual budget/fiscal stance is. The government is very capable of running a ruinous inflationary budget if it likes, irrespective of whether it borrows or spends past savings, or even via simply misguided policy. It's similarly capable of stifling demand and forcing people onto the unemployment stack by simply spending too little/taxing too high, as we've seen in the UK over the [past many years](http://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-per-capita-ppp). *Any* government can stifle opportunities by doing this - there's always going to be a level of taxes that if exceeded, will destroy jobs in the economy. Just look at Greece or Spain for an example of where government's have gone far too hard on the brakes.

Now what you're supposing is that *on top of* the real constraint that the government faces - that the economy can only produce so much - you're supposing that there's an *additional* constraint that the government can also run out of pounds. And that therefore the government can't just make full employment and price stability its prime goals, but also has to try and balance the budget to the best of its ability - a constraint that often leads to full employment being abandoned, meaning that the economy as a norm operates below capacity, as we're concerned about the government ""using up all the pounds"" and being denied any more.

If it doesn't want those particular doctors it will be because it can hire better elsewhere.

If the NHS wanted those EU doctors it would have them.     
If it could get better, it would be able to get better.       

**Why would there be less EU doctors?     
Do you think they wouldn't be able to compete under workvisas?**  

- IF they can compete they'll rise to the top. We may even have more.     

- IF you're arguing they wouldn't be able to compete on the same workvisa model as those people outside the EU then you're arguing that the NHS will improve by leaving.

WIN-WIN!!!

Being part of the EU is not a prerequisite.  We don't need it.  We certainly don't need it to staff the NHS.



&gt;Let's pick up the worst UK's hospital and base whole NHS on that ONE hospital? Is this still a valid point? 

No because that's obtuse in the extreme.   To draw parallels to the EU with that analogy you'd have to say that you accept the worst hospital in the UK on the grounds that you have to accept the worst to get the best.   In the EU you have to accept all members equally.

Of course in the NHS we don't have to do that.  There is nothing to stop us criticising the worst hospital and not treating it the same as the best.   You say your analogy doesn't work, and that's why mine doesn't apply?!? - but it is your analogy that doesn't work.

There is absolutely no reason why the UK should be giving priority to movement from poorer education systems, from lesser health systems, because they're part of the EU over non EU members.

If we didn't give priority to some over others, and if the UK found itself outside the EU, the NHS would still be able to recruit people from all over the world just as easily, including those from the EU, just as OP with the heart attack noticed.

&gt;You picked up poorest EU country, just like all other EU countries were at the same level. Yet, Brexit would happen with whole Europe, not only Bulgaria.

It's not necessarily about Barca being willing to let him go but just that since they prioritised signing Neymar, they now have a surplus of attackers and need the money elsewhere.

Currently they have Neymar, Sanchez, Pedro, Tello, and now Deulofeu and of course Messi. Since they play 4-3-3 you'd think that wouldn't really be an issue since Neymar/Sanchez/Pedro can rotate over a 60 game season. But in the big games Sanchez is usually dropped for Fabregas and I think that hurt him, he doesn't feel trusted. Now they seem to think Deulofeu can replace either of Sanchez or Pedro as third choice.

Barca have needed an alternative to Messi for a while like a natural no.9. They tried it with Ibra, then with Villa. If they were to sell Sanchez I think they'd sign a striker. The rest of their money will go towards someone to replace Fabregas/Xavi - Rakitic it seems - and the defence.

Barca fans would actually prefer to sell Pedro despite him being homegrown, but Sanchez's agent seems to be pushing for a move as he's less willing to sit on the bench and has had lots of offers whereas Pedro doesn't want to leave.",0,1402244617,null,0,false,0,ci28j3x,t3_27mgyu,t1_ci28j3x,t1_ci287f4,null,1434146866,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

It strikes me as very similar to Arsenal fans last summer. Yes, our bid wasn't insultingly low, but Lallana has a contract with Southampton. They are not required to sell him if they don't want to, and if they do decide to sell him, the *only* valuation that matters is theirs. 

He's their star player, and as you've said, their whole squad is getting raided this summer. Sure, they'll have money to buy replacements, but we both know they're not going to be able to attract replacements of Lallana/Shaw's quality, so if they want to overcharge for him, that's their right.

I'm also not sure why you're saying they've been continually hiking the price...I can't recall seeing their quoted price being anything other than 30m. 

Obviously as a Liverpool fan I think that's high, and I want us to get Lallana, but I don't like this attitude that just because we have some money that meets *our* valuation we're entitled to get the player.

Intersex and transgender are not the same thing. It's also not a valid rebuttal to my argument. There are people born without legs, but that doesn't mean that humans aren't a bipedal species. 

Psychiatrists might well play along with their clients' delusions, but that doesn't make them real. An awful lot of surgeons, psychiatrists, and endocrinologists are making an awful lot of money by going along with the trans narrative. IMO it's incredibly unethical to be performing all this unnecessary surgery. You wouldn't give liposuction to an anorexic who believes she's fat, so why are they removing the breasts of women who believe they're men? Anyway, my point is that the medical profession has a vested interest in going along with it, but it doesn't prove anything. 

What I would like you to answer me is this: what exactly is it that makes a woman? Is it a dress? Breasts? A Vagina? Smooth legs? A swaying of the hips? A high pitched voice? Because all of these things aren't what makes a woman, these are all just bad stereotypes. And all that transgender 'women' are doing is performing a bunch of stereotypes associated with women. 

If men's skeletons can magically morph into women's, just by taking hormones, I'd like to see the studies because I'd be really astounded. Do they morph back again if they stop taking them? In that case I'd also question why it is a lot of men find it necessary to have 'facial feminisation surgery', which shaves off bits of bone.

Thank you yes I am aware that interest rates vary, however the adjustments in the economy you describe take place under minor shifts, the economy simply does not have the capacity or is able to shift fast enough to accommodate a major slide.

Currencies can't infinitely vary to find an equilibrium without causing internal problems because we are not a self sufficient country.

Since introducing top-up insurance to its national insurance, medicine prices have begun rising rapidly not unlike what we see in the US.   Their stays in hospitals after an operation are getting shorter too.  Insurers are becoming less and less willing to pay for lengthy stays.

They're not there yet, and they still have a national insurer - but all the US-style cracks in the ice are there.

France is a different kettle of fish.  They have private top up insurance too but they're very much kicking back.  Having said that they do pay a lot more, and they also pay at least â¬23 to visit their GP.  They can claim up to 70% back.  

Still, there's something about the principle behind the NHS that it should be free at the point of use, that you shouldn't have to check your wallet before you seek medical attention, that really resonates with me.  I'd rather have an NHS system slightly behind chasing a French system if it means staying loyal to that principle.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; equilibrium without causing internal problems because we are not a self sufficient country.

If by ""self-sufficient"" you mean able to get by just fine without foreign trade.. well, I don't know any countries that could really.

But that's why we trade. The UK's particularly good at it - each month it exports about GBP42bn worth of stuff, and imports about GBP44bn ([figures](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/imports)). That, to me, is about as self-sufficient as one can hope to be. If we're not borrowing foreign currencies, if we're paying for our imports with exports (free floating currencies allow for imbalances where one or the other party's saving the other's currency, so the few percent delta is not a concern) - why, that's a perfectly sustainable model, which is why it works, and why it won't collapse. Japan is much the same.

&gt; if the currency slides far enough we literally would lose the ability to keep the lights on.

To clarify, this slide you're talking about comes because people *in the UK* have decided they no longer want to hold pounds. So they dissave them, buying foreign currencies and assets as a store of wealth instead right?

Now in this hypothetical where the pound's sliding.. why doesn't the government simply raise taxes? The government can boost demand for the pound instantly domestically - it can go so far as to make it scarce, drying up job opportunities and causing *deflation* as you see in much of Europe. In a snap, it can make offloading pounds the very last thing on people's minds.. so if the solution is so simple, if demand can be restored in a snap, why would we ever lose ""confidence"" in the first place? And again, why haven't the Japanese?

That is, why are we preemptively making money scarce through austerity and budget cuts.. instead of simply doing it when/if it seems demand for the pound is falling - which is, if you're being honest, is a hypothetical without precedent? That is, if you have a contingency plan, and your fear may prove to be irrational.. why preemptively starve the economy of spending today, when it may not be necessary at all?",0,1402246148,null,0,false,0,ci29459,t3_27l8va,t1_ci29459,t1_ci28on8,null,1434147140,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I already know that and understand the point of view of Yorkshire people. But if coal mines were not really able to pay for themselves..?

true,Flower_Fairy,null,null,"You claimed some ""basic biological facts"" as being the case for all men and women, when that simply isn't true. Sex and gender are more complicated than that, I gave examples. I never said being intersex and transgender were the same thing, except in that they are both exceptions from the norm of ""XY = man"". The point is you can't use a rule to exclude trans people when there are already established cases that break your rule.

The idea that psychiatrists are conspiring to make more money is nonsense. A lot of these people are extremely dedicated and care deeply about their patients. You can't dismiss several entire professions as ""playing along with delusions"".

The anorexia comparison doesn't hold up because allowing an anorexic to ""treat"" themselves however they wanted would result in them dying slowly and horribly, allowing a person with gender dysphoria to treat themselves however they wanted would result in a much happier, content and well adjusted member of society. A better comparison to make your point would've been [BIID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_identity_disorder), but that doesn't hold water either since BIID people desire a body state that's less functional than they currently have and so should arguably be protected from hurting themselves. You can't make that argument for trans people who want to transition since they just want a body that works differently and no less functionally, a body that is the norm for a very large number of people.

The question of what makes a woman is the entire focus of the comment I linked, the answer being their gender identity. I agree that it has nothing to do with the stereotypes you listed. I think you accidentally agreed with me when you said that not all people with a vagina are women and that women having a vagina is just a stereotype.

The idea that all trans women are doing is performing some sort of act is silly, what possible motivation would there be for them to do that? You think they'd cause massive upheaval in every aspect of their life, put all their relationships and career on the line, take drugs for the rest of their life, open themselves up to some of the worst discrimination and possibly even have a major surgery... Just for the sake of a performance they're putting on? The amount of pain the dysphoria causes them, how resistant gender identity is to being changed, the relief they get from living as the gender they identify as and the young ages from which they're sometimes aware seem to pretty clearly indicate that it's something much more fundamental.

I never talked about magical changes to skeletons, I mentioned that HRT can prevent any sort of magical change being necessary if it's started at a young enough age. Facial feminisation surgery would be pointless for someone who started HRT in their teens.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"I see where you're coming from but I'm not willing to chalk Fabregas up as this classy former captain of Arsenal who is ""once a gunner, always a gunner"".

Keep in mind, he left. He didn't let his contract wind down and leave on a free transfer like a one-club-man with a yearning to return home, he didn't dismiss transfer rumours when a high flying Barcelona came knocking, he left for a big Â£35m transfer fee with a couple million in bonuses at 24 years old. 

If you ask an Arsenal fan they'll probably say he left because his friends from the national team, and guys he grew up playing with at La Masia were all there - and that might be a factor. 

But let's be real here. This guy was Arsenal's rising star and youngest captain and he jumped ship in his prime when a bigger and better club that was winning title after title came banging at the door. Bear in mind,  Fabregas went 6 years without any success at club level. He was winning individual PFA, UEFA, ESM, and PL accolades, a World Cup and a European Championship but winning shit all with Arsenal.

You know who this sounds like? Robin Van Persie.

Arsenal's talisman up front. Sure he got injured all the time but boy could he fire in goals when they needed him the most, so supporters defended him and bragged when he scored 30 goals in the 2011-2012 season. They also made him the captain in 2011!

He won individual PL, UEFA, Arsenal, and PFA awards during his tenure at Arsenal but, again, six years with zero trophies at club level.

The difference, van Persie was a little more open about his motives to leave. ""Oh the little boy inside me wants to go to Man United."" Sure, he danced around it a little bit, but he wanted a PL medal around his neck before he hung up his boots. He was scoring goals for a team that wasn't going to effectively challenge for a piece of silverware. 

The difference between Fabregas and Van Persie is a matter of PR and the narrative surrounding their exits, but let's be real - they both wanted the same thing, success. One club wasn't giving it to them, so they went somewhere where they were guaranteed at least *one* title.

This is just my interpretation of it anyways - and I think you make a valid point. All optics considered, he was Arsenal's poster boy. I just think it's bullshit. If he had moved to City instead of Barcelona, he'd have been an absolute villain. But he moved home, so it's acceptable and he's still a hero? 

I won't speak to the ""Mourinho"" player bit, because I think that it's just short hand in this subreddit for ""I; A) don't have the depth or breadth of knowledge to have a serious tactical discussion about football, B) see that discussion is about player on a team in a league I don't follow or watch, so I'll ask if he's a ""Mourinho Player"" to find out cursory and otherwise useless information, or C) notice that we're talking about a potential/existing player I don't like, so I'll say he's not a Mourinho player and everyone will know what I'm getting at"". It's like people who say so-and-so doesn't fit ""The Systemâ¢"" and leave it at that.

I'm not willing to believe Fabregas is going to be ""always"" a gunner. If he was always a gunner, he'd stay in Spain where his friends (the people he left Arsenal for in the first place) are playing. Either way, if he's coming to Chelsea he's going to have to mind his tongue and win over people who think he's persona non grata.

If they were deploying to a job for which firearms were not approved (like searching for a missing child) then they couldn't take their tasers.

We've been arguing back and forth on the same subject for about a day now and I don't think you're actually understanding my point of view.

This is meaningless. 

'Feeling like a woman' is based entirely on stereotypes. Please prove me wrong. Please tell me what you think a woman is. Explain it to me in any way that doesn't involve a set of stereotypes.

I didn't 'accidentally agree' with you when I mentioned the word vagina. I mentioned that because some men seem think that getting a surgically created fuck hole = being a woman. It doesn't.

That period has now expired and, if he stays, Adebayorâs basic pay is likely to be Â£80-90,000 a week.

The crown estates are one of several property portfolios owned by the Queen. But unlike the others, the Crown estate is leased to the government in perpetuity at the start of each new monarchs reign, in exchange for a stipend to live off many times smaller than the proceeds created by the crown estate... it was originally negotiated largely because the income from the crown estate can be spikey (i.e. a lot of it was agricultural and a bad harvest = no money). This meant the monarch had a guaranteed income regardless of the profitability of the land, and the state had the benefit of greater income in the longer term - plus the state had the size to absorb the spikey income. It is important because in principle the Royal Family could, if they wanted, not sign them over at the start of a new reign. It gives them protection from the Government trying to ""land grab"" their assets. Although it may be controversial having one family own so much, the bottom line is regardless of its moral rights and wrongs, the monarch does legally own that land - and if the government took the land or failed to pay for it, they'd be breaking the law.

The Queen 100% owns the crown estate. It is her personal property, leased to the state. Proof? - Here is Jacob Rees Mogg [putting it far more eloquently than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anb7BKIujtI).

So what then are places like Balmoral? - These are parts of **other** property portfolios owned by the Queen, however they are not part of the crown estates, so are not leased to the state. There are other packets of Royal property and assets that are similar - like the Prince of Wales 'Duchy of Cornwall'.

&gt;No because that's obtuse in the extreme.......In the EU you have to accept all members equally.

Nope. It's exactly the same. You won't treat any British citizens in different way, just because their local University isn't up to a standard good enough, to staff that local hospital with people on a level seen nationally.

Also, nothing stops the EU in increasing those levels and that's THE WHOLE reason EU exists, to raise standards in poorer EU parts, making all people, at least in Europe EQUAL.

I really don't think that NHS gives priority to EU doctors, but not to the non-EU ones.

So? Again, the EU is a global initiative, which aims on increasing equality on our continent, to treat people exactly at the same level, to make their lives easier.

What you and whole anti-EU group wants is to build borders and stop integration in Europe. Obviously, the ideal scenario would be to make whole world equal, but that won't happen, at least in our lifetime, simply because of huge differences between first and third world countries. The EU tries to make that level of equality at least in Europe and you can already see that by looking at some Eastern European countries, which for example like Poland weren't affected by global financial crisis, or (I think) Czech Republic, had a high increase in GDP or something like that.

&gt;Brexit means being able to recruit wherever, whenever, and whoever, we want.

Yet, it won't achieve the same easy level we currently have in the EU as there always will be visas, permits and whole ""Papers, please"" (check out that game if you're into it) kind of approach.

&gt;Why would there be less EU doctors?

As I've told you, because it's HARDER with visas and many people would rather go work in other EU country, rather than apply for a visa and fulfil all (often hard) requirements the Home Office asks for.",0,1402256213,null,0,false,0,ci2d85u,t3_27m2id,t1_ci2d85u,t1_ci28fpi,null,1434149079,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The __Global Peace Index__ (__GPI__) is an attempt to measure the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness.  It is the product of [Institute for Economics and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Economics_and_Peace) (IEP) and developed in consultation with an international panel of peace experts from peace institutes and [think tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank) with data collected and collated by the [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist_Intelligence_Unit). The list was launched first in May 2007, then continued yearly. It is claimed to be the first study to rank countries around the world according to their peacefulness. It ranks 162 countries (up from 121 in 2007). The study is the brainchild of Australian entrepreneur [Steve Killelea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Killelea) and is endorsed by individuals such as [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan), the [Dalai Lama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama), archbishop [Desmond Tutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu), former Finnish President [Martti Ahtisaari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martti_Ahtisaari), Nobel laureate [Muhammad Yunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus), economist [Jeffrey Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs), former president of Ireland [Mary Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Robinson), [Jan Eliasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Eliasson) and former US president [Jimmy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter). Factors examined by the authors include internal factors such as levels of violence and crime within the country and factors in a country's external relations such as [military expenditure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_expenditure) and wars. The index is launched each year at events in London, Washington DC and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.

My other granddad was a carburettor specialist in the RAF in North Africa; when the normal aeroplane techs couldn't fix something, they sent for his team of specialist engineers.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Yet, NHS is having shortages in qualified staff, even though there is a free movement in the EU as well as non-EU qualified staff can apply for visa! 

So we drop the WHD that comes with the EU, for the NHS, and open our field to an even greater recruitment field...only focusing on the skills we need over an open door policy to all.

&gt;Nope. It's exactly the same. You won't treat any British citizens in different way, just because their local University isn't up to a standard good enough, to staff that local hospital with people on a level seen nationally.

Errr....yes we do!  That's exactly what we do.  We absolutely gauge people on the university they qualify from, and the level of their education.    

People scrabble to get to the top universities for good reason, precisely because we look at their level of education.

&gt;Also, nothing stops the EU in increasing those levels and that's THE WHOLE reason EU exists, to raise standards in poorer EU parts, making all people, at least in Europe EQUAL.

But that isn't a UK issue.  In increasing EU levels the UK bar is going to drop lower if it has to raise the EU average.

The UK however could keep a higher standard, and then recruit from the highest standards still.  

&gt;I really don't think that NHS gives priority to EU doctors, but not to the non-EU ones.

GREAT!  So you just abandon that EU doctors need to be in the EU to be hired by the NHS.  Exactly what I've been arguing.  The UK doesn't need to be in the EU to hire NHS staff!!!

Thanks.

&gt;So? Again, the EU is a global initiative, which aims on increasing equality on our continent, to treat people exactly at the same level, to make their lives easier.


A global initiative that requires some, those outside the EU, to be treated differently?

This 'global initiative' of yours...it's somewhat counter to an equal standard of recruitment for those outside the UK.  Rather it looks to prioritise people from the EU.

You say, ""to treat people exactly at the same level"".

Yet all I'm suggesting is that all EU people be treated the same as those outside the EU...

&gt;What you and whole anti-EU group wants is to build borders and stop integration in Europe.

Rather promote integration.  Not allow immigration without integration, and to promote EU immigration on par to the rest of the world. 

&gt;The EU tries to make that level of equality at least in Europe and you can already see that by looking at some Eastern European countries, which for example like Poland weren't affected by global financial crisis, or (I think) Czech Republic, had a high increase in GDP or something like that.

Nothing that couldn't be achieved outside a Free Trade Deal outside the EU.

&gt;Yet, it won't achieve the same easy level we currently have in the EU as there always will be visas, permits and whole ""Papers, please"" (check out that game if you're into it) kind of approach.

But it would be better for the UK and the NHS.      

Everything beneficial can be delivered by the UK being outside the EU.   We could still recruit the people we need.

&gt;As I've told you, because it's HARDER with visas and many people would rather go work in other EU country, rather than apply for a visa and fulfil all (often hard) requirements the Home Office asks for.


If you're arguing that an EU doctor wouldn't be hired if they had to meet the same requirements of a non-EU doctor (and they clearly don't have an issue being hired), then you're really arguing that if there was an even playing field then the NHS would end up hiring better doctors.

Malta and Cyprus were beside us, as was Greece. Greece was defeated by German forces in 1941 (?) following a failed invasion by Italy, but Britain was fighting in Greece. 

Following the fall of Greece, Britain fell back to Cyprus only to be driven out by German Paratrooper forces within 2 weeks. However, despite this, Britain knew Africa needed to be held. It had been invaded by Italy, and Germany had taken the Iraqi oil fields. Thus, the African front opened and the only way to maintain it was to hold the Med against the relatively strong Italian Navy. They also needed to hold Malta as their port in the Med, which they did.

In 1943, we invaded Italy, believing it to be the way into Germany. However, they soon realized the mountains in the North were just not a realistic invasion route, which led to the Normandy front opening.
