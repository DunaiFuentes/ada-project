We have a great local butcher and a decent grocer. The weekend market is pretty good for the area but the farmers markets are popular enough.

All of this is in the town centre, yet Tesco want to build an out of town supermarket (larger than the other two) with no direct link into town.

They may be cheaper, but they won't offer the variety that we currently have. Sometimes I want to pay more, to get the leg of lamb from the farmer down the road and know how it was looked after. Sometimes I am happy with the cheap chorizo from Aldi, but sometimes my wife wants the better cheese from Waitrose.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; this doesn't stop any current government from imposing absolutely anything that overrules any specific freedom that we might have

And yet that hasn't happened since magna carta. In Europe, on the other hand, what you fear for the UK has happened repeatedly over many centuries. As such, the English Common Law system has proved more effective for time immemorial.

&gt; what's the point of having freedom by default when you have an authoritarian government who will happily overrule any freedoms without a second thought?

There is no difference between what the UK can overrule and what the EU can overrule. The differences lie in that the government of the UK is accountable to the people of the UK whereas the government of the EU is accountable to the wider EU, not to the UK and that unless something is specifically prohibited it is permitted under the UK system whereas the opposite is true under most EU states' law. As such, your perspective appears weakened rather than strengthened by this argument.

&gt; I simply cannot and will not ever be able to reconcile the way we elect government. This is one of the major reasons I would take a European government over our own. Even if more flawed by other metrics, a better representation of the people is preferred and has a lot of weight to it when all things are considered.

Why do you feel there is a better representation in the EU system? That seems counter-intuitive. Do you feel that the Lords represents the UK better than the Commons because it is appointed rather than using FPTP?

&gt; I have more faith in the EU to create a better EU and a better world for everyone than I have for the UK creating a better UK, or a better anything for anyone.

I cannot convince you to renounce faith through logic and evidence, but I can propose articles that call you to question that faith. Within the EU peoples have competing interests. Nation states enable these interests to be balanced at a more local level than a superstate. Where peoples have coinciding interests their states can enter treaties to address those interests. All of this can be done directly obviating the additional cost and bureaucracy the EU brings. Everything positive the EU does can be done without it if the people want it. The superstate is simply a superfluous gravy train for career bureaucrats. ",0,1396560808,null,0,false,0,cgjdylh,t3_221eii,t1_cgjdylh,t1_cgjbxze,null,1433197797,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Kavarian Chapter could travel in time - they had to, in order to get River back in time. But it wasn't established that the guys who created the Apollo program could do that.

&gt;and destroying the economy in the process

*'the economy'* is a loaded political term used by elites to justify the excesses of economic systems that benefit them. Why should working people submit themselves to this 'economy' that rules over and above them. Society's ills and problems are simply cast of as *'it's the economy'*, therefore denying people the ability to solve these problems for fear of hurting *'the economy'*. People aren't allowed to control their lives, poverty is justified, austerity implemented, and homelessness is ignored always in reference to that illusory notion *'the economy'* - what it really means is profits and capital are more important that labour and human life and wellbeing. The term is employed to stop people acting to ameliorate their condition, under the false axiom that *'the economy'* refers to everyone's interests when really it only refers to some (of course this fallacy infects the whole discourse, the parameters of economic success such as GDP or productivity is measuring the rich getting richer, profit increases and capital accumulations). 

If people had simply accepted the dictats of *'the economy'* then we would be working 12 hour days as people previously did, we wouldn't have a weekend, we wouldn't have holidays. Those things didn't just natural emerge; they would fought for by workers around the world. The [8-hour day struggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day) was part of the global militant workers movement, of course those that opposed it then argued it would ruin the economy, using the same arguments that had been used against banning child labour.

In fact the amount of annual hours worked in a country has little effect on the economy, countries like the USA and Britain have less holidays and work more overall, yet our productivity still lags behind countries like Canada and Germany, countries with relatively strong workers’ rights. That said we should question why 'efficiency' and 'output' should even be a goal, is it more important than everything? 

&gt;Also I completely disagree with your statement

Disagreeing with facts just makes you look silly. In 1979 the CEO of a UK company earned slightly less than 10 times as much as the average worker on the shop floor. By 2013 a CEO of a FTSE 100 company is paid about 160 times the average UK worker. Over that same period workers' pay - when inflation is taken into account - barely rose at all, and any meagre gains were lost in the 2008 crash, since when most workers' wages have been falling in real terms. [Source](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2439396/COMMENT-Forget-politics-envy--makes-economic-sense-close-gap-executive-pay.html)

During the 1960s *""pay and productivity grew in tandem, but they separated in the 1970s. In the 1990s boom, pay growth lagged behind productivity by almost 30%""*. Looking purely at direct pay, *""overall productivity rose four times as fast as the average real hourly wage -- and twenty times as fast in manufacturing""*. Pay did catch up a bit in the late 1990s, but after 2000 *""pay returned to its lagging position""*. *[Doug Henwood, After the New Economy, pp. 45-6]*

Those massive rises in productivity since the 1960s should have both increased the wages and decreased the amount of hours worked, but they don't, because such logic doesn't regulate capitalism, which only seeks profit, the extraction of which comes at the expense of workers. The domination and exploitation of the work process will never change unless workers organise to change it; the present mode of operation certainly benefits some.

The crowd will get behind them and they will start to leave themselves open looking for a second. That will allow us to counter. We will score before half time, Studge making it 1-1.

The reality is that most people in the UK don't like them enough to want them near them (although personally I don't really mind them) and they often get stopped because of planning permission failings. Also, large offshore plants can be built nearer to some of the larger population centres as the crow flies which is important when considering transmission losses. Even if the planning disputes didn't exist, there's simply a lot more space suitable for turbine placement offshore than onshore so you can't really split them off. It's also easier to put a large array of offshore turbines close together in a bank like the London Array offshore than onshore than it is on land where it's difficult to find larger suitable sites. 

The other thing is, that's the cost for new nuclear which would (if the government weren't being stupid and basically tendering it out to every company trying different reactor designs) start to fall because of the expertise that gets built up; once you have the infrastructure in place to build a nuclear power station, building a second should fall in cost. They tend to be built near each other (Sizewell A, B, Hinckley Point, Dungeness). The expertise has drained from the UK and the infrastructure has disappeared because we haven't built any for such a long time.

Also the fact is being proud of Britain doesn't mean being proud of just its countryside, food etc., but involves the tacit unquestioning acceptance of lots of other things. Being patriotic is absolving yourself of critical thought, hence why the Daily Mail could say - quite legitimately under the assumptions of patriotism - that Ralph Milibands questioning of why we have an army, a queen and so on was anti-British. The illusory notion of the nation, just like race, has always been employed to do awful things. Patriotism necessarily implies subordinating other countries to your own, which can be used to justify many things (bringing civilisation etc.). It a notion that literally kills, it means that people should risk their lives to save people or protect interests just because they are from the same nation, not because they know them, agree with them, share any rational beliefs with them, but because they were born in the same geographical area. 

The concept of the nation was constructed by a ruling-class to gain the support of those they ruled, to proclaim there was no class interests only national interest which apparently everyone shared - thus justifying sending millions of soldiers to die in wars to protect the status quo of nations that denied them their true liberation and lives. National interest is synonymous with ruling class interest, and represents the denial of class interests and human interest that transcend borders and the particular interests of elites.

true,rudderrudder,null,null,"I can elaborate but let me first clarify. I didn't say that ""basing"" your opinion on your experience is embarrassing. We all do that. I said that supporting your argument with that experience is silly.

1) Most times I see this done in online soccer forums it is an attempt to settle a disagreement. As in 'my opinion is right because I've played XYZ and you obviously haven't and if you were a great player like me you'd know that I'm right.' It's an online forum and the only currency you have is your ideas and ability to support them with words.
2) Frankly, 99.9% of us who have played don't have credibility at the level of Liverpool. Judging a player or play based on what we've ""done a hundred times"" is ignoring a vastly superior opponent, massive pressure and, very often, how a player is being told to play the game. Appealing to your prowess as a player to give credence to your opinions makes one look vainglorious in the extreme.
3) that's not the case in your example - given that it's just the basis of your opinion. But if you were arguing with the legion of idiots who say dumb things in online soccer forums by saying ""I'm right based on my experience and you're wrong based on your lack thereof"" you haven't really made an argument. You've made an appeal to authority that no one in an online forum can evaluate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority)
4) Seriously, online arguments are pretty embarrassing regardless of how they're conducted. Dudes typing away at their keyboards about situations we know almost nothing about. It can be fun, of course, but trying to take it too seriously... well, I guess I'm proving my own point here...

&gt;

&gt;__Argument from authority__ (*Argumentum ab auctoritate*), also __authoritative argument__ and __appeal to authority__, is a common [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy). 

&gt;Fallacious examples of using the appeal include   any appeal to authority used in the context of [deductive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive) reasoning, and appealing to the position of an authority or authorities to dismiss evidence. 

&gt;The appeal to authority is a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy)  because authorities are not necessarily correct about judgments related to their field of expertise.  Though reliable authorities can be correct in judgments related to their area of expertise more often than laypersons, [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] they can still come to the wrong judgments through error, bias, dishonesty, or falling prey to [groupthink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink). Thus, the appeal to authority is not an argument for establishing facts.

Also, given the fact that he wants to leave and is surplus to PSG will mean he would come relatively cheap. Will definitely make for a very good back-up if we also sign Diego Costa too.

The UK does not have 50% unemployment, halving the number of hours people work will require companies to employ twice the number of people, people who don't exist. Also at twice the cost, since they apparently have to pay people the same for half the work so you instantly double business costs at a minimum, probably more since there is now a 45% excess of employment, wages (and prices) would all sky rocket, many if not all businesses would go out of business. In the long term since the price of man hours just doubled robotics will see a huge boost and many low skilled workers will find themselves replaced by machines.

On top of that, a 40hr week is in no way unreasonable, in fact I would love to work a 40hr week it feels like a holiday when I do. It represents less than 25% of your time at work, how much do you hate your job if you can't manage that?

straw man be straw man. You can be proud of your mother, you know her, you love her and so on. In fact is has historically been the prerogative of nationalism to proclaim the nation as the highest interest, i.e. it is more important than your mother, your love for it greater – but for any critical observer the love for a mother is very different to a love for a nation (I can talk to a nation, I can see a nation, I can’t speak to it and so on, in fact most people can’t even define it). 

Being patriotic is the assumption that you have more in common with 'British people' than with 'American people' just because they are British. And this notion is employed to justify many dangerous and negative things. Illusory notions like 'the nation' hide the fact that you're a lot more likely to have something in common with Americans or French people of the same age range and social status than with all 'British people' independent of any specificity. And when another major war comes people will be forced to fight (and like usual if not, imprisoned for being 'un-patriotic') against some other people for this thing 'the nation'. Patriotism completely disables meaningful debate, no one in the media or establishment society will ever question systematically things like the army (i.e. why does it exists, why should people be paid to kill other people, why isn't it wrong to order someone to kill others) for fear of being called 'un-patriotic'. And hence why we get the near complete consensus on all issues of national policy, with any difference in the margins, and any slight criticism always premised with the 'but I support this country'. Is someone bad for not supporting their country? Is someone bad for recognising national interest is code of ruling-class interest (for it makes little difference for the ruled which group rules them).

Similarly, most of them won't do stuff in a public court - if a case they have goes to court they'll hire a barrister to do it for them.^*

As for finding a solicitor, competitiveness/low prices might be a thing to look for, but that may not be the best thing. I've never had to instruct a lawyer, but the Law Society has a [find a solicitor](http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/) page, with some information about solicitors, and there's a [Legal 500](http://www.legal500.com/books/l500) list of the 'top' 500 law firms in the UK, sorted by region and practice area.

You could also try asking over in /r/uklaw - they might know better places to look for.

^* The analogy I like to use to explain the difference between lawyers, solicitors and barristers is that if lawyers are doctors, barristers are surgeons, and solicitors are most other kinds of doctor. If you're sick or have a problem, you go to a normal doctor who, if needed, will find you a surgeon. Going straight to a surgeon with a medical problem might be weird.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Perhaps this is difficult for you to comprehend, but the connection people have with their country can be a motivator for them to do their best for the country

this kind of irrational appeals to emotion is exactly the problem. It patriotism that assumes a doctor is there to help British people, i.e. people in this geographical area, and not of course any people seriously ill or in greater need around the world, because they are, after all not British, and hence not worthy (or not as much) as British people - independent of their medical condition. Why should people care more about this country than other countries? More about these people they don't know than others they don't, especially when so often it comes at the expense of those others. Why is making this area great so much more important than making another area great (to the extent that most are willing to sacrifice the success of other areas for that of ‘their’ own) 

Also the examples you give are weak at best. I doubt very much people who pick up litter when asked would say their primary motivator is patriotism or nationalism, they would say they like to keep things clean etc. which has no relationship to the nation. The same goes for doctors, I doubt very much that their primary reason for their occupation is nationalism or patriotism - under that assumption a doctor would treat a British person over another only due to them being British, which is quite an unusual act for doctors who’s primary motivator is helping **people** independent and irrelevant of and from nation(s). In fact doctors are a good example against nationalism considering it's one of the few occupations that tends to transcend borders and nations more than others (i.e. doctors without borders) - and in fact countries - such as Cuba - who generally downplay nationalism contribute much more to programs such as doctors without borders, and do a lot more to help people around the world independent of nation (i.e. [Cuban doctors bring free healthcare and eyesight to the forgotten people of Haiti]( http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/08/cuban-doctors-bring-eyesight-healthcare-to-haiti/), or since 2006 Cuban doctors have restored vision to 2.2 million Latin Americans through simple eye surgeries, a tiny country of 10 million sends more doctors to assist in developing countries than the entire G8 combined. More than 20% of Cuban doctors — or 15,407 — are on missions in 66 countries around the world and have saved 4 million lives over the past five decades, think of the difference that absence of nationalism and patriotism has created, the lives it has saved. [source]( http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2012/06/02/cubatrained_doctors_making_difference_around_the_world.html)). 

I would content that the less a doctor cares about 'their' nation, the better the doctor. The flipside of course would be refusing to help people who aren't from 'your' nation, which isn't uncommon in nationalistic countries. Proclaiming to put Britain first automatically comes at the expense of other people and the subordination of other nations who are Britain’s 'lessers' and who we 'compete' against for our right to 'greatness'. The notion of Britain is always utilised by mental charlatans and tyrants. Also I think most of this debate here has actually been outside of the central content of patriotism and nationalism, its origin and function, the question of whether the nation is good or not isn't about supporting Britain in a football match etc., it's a lot more meaningful and important than that.

*""When I was in high school... I asked myself at one point: ""Why do i care if my high school's team wins the football game? I don't know anybody on the team, they have nothing to do with me... why am I here and applaud? It does not make any sense."" But the point is, it does make sense: It's a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority and group cohesion behind leadership elements. In fact it's training in irrational jingoism. That's also a feature of competitive sports""* -N. Chomsky-

*""..jingoism, racism, fear, religious fundamentalism: these are the ways of appealing to people if you’re trying to organize a mass base of support for policies that are really intended to crush them.""* -Chomsky-

Edinburgh Castle is hard to miss, being atop Castle Rock in the city centre, though it's pretty expensive to get in from memory and a lot of the buildings within are surprisingly modern (or at least only a hundred or two years old).  There's also [Craigmillar Castle](http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_123), which is a fairly small medieval castle, and there's [Lauriston Castle](http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/Lauriston-Castle.aspx) - to be honest more like a small stately home, but quite interesting as it's basically been preserved as it was in 1926 when it was last lived in.  At the risk of speaking heresy I'd consider skipping Edinburgh Castle itself - I think Scotland has better castles (eg Stirling), and Edinburgh has better things to see!

Art museums - there are three main ones which comprise the [National Galleries of Scotland](http://www.nationalgalleries.org/).  You have the National Gallery itself ""The world’s greatest art in the heart of Edinburgh"" which is right in the city centre at the bottom of the Mound, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (I think you can guess the type of painting in here) which is a couple of minutes' walk away on Queen Street, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art which is a middling distance away, but there's a free bus that runs between it and the National Gallery.  Would definitely recommend all three, bonus is the admission's free too!

Probably also worth a look is the [Museum on the Mound](http://www.museumonthemound.com/), located within the beautiful Bank of Scotland head office on the Mound, and concerning itself with money and related things - unusual, and again free entry.

Could then take a walk down the Royal Mile (many ancient buildings), there's the Museum of Childhood there, and at the bottom you can see both the striking [Scottish Parliament](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/visitandlearn/436.aspx) building, and the [Palace of Holyroodhouse](http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/palace-of-holyroodhouse) (where the Queen stays when in town - you can go in though it does cost)

Depending on the time you have available it's definitely worth going up either Calton Hill (just at the east end of Princes Street, more central) or Arthur's Seat (just south of the Old Town, slightly further out) for the views.

There are also guided tour buses, while perhaps a little ""obvious"" and touristy they're a decent way to see around several major sites that are a little way from the city centre (eg the [Royal Botanic Gardens](http://www.rbge.org.uk/), or the former [Royal Yacht Britannia](http://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk/)), and you'll learn a few odd snippets that many locals don't know (like [where in Edinburgh there's a statue of Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Calton_Cemetery#Scottish_.E2.80.93_American_Soldiers_Monument)).

&gt;A focal point of the graveyard, just in front of Hume’s tomb, this piece of statuary was erected in 1893.  It depicts a standing figure of [Abraham Lincoln](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln), with a freed slave giving thanks at his feet. A bronze shield bears the old US flag, and is wreathed in thistles to the left, and cotton to the right. Two regimental flags lie furled, the battle being over. The black man holds a book, indicating that he is not only free, he is also now educated. This was the first statue to an American President in any country outwith the USA. It is the only statue of Lincoln in Scotland, and the only monument to the [American Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) outwith the USA. The monument was erected at American expense to a small group of Scots (only one of whom, William Duff, is buried under the monument, the rest being nearby) to whom it felt indebted, and wished their graves to be marked, despite their later poverty. They had all fought for the [Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War\)) (the North) in the American Civil War. The inscription, ""To preserve the jewel of liberty in the framework of Freedom"" is a quotation from the writings of Abraham Lincoln.

There are a lot of unhappy and stressed folk out there with high fixed outgoings  and expensive cars...

With regards pensions, remember that you can only access the money relatively late in your life. But the benefit of pensions is that the government puts back your tax when you contribute to it, and therefore that grows more than an equivalent post-tax ISA.

I'd suggest continuing to contribute the company pension you have; save for your house deposit in a cash isa; and anything left over put into funds in an ISA. I strongly recommend researching funds a lot. Eventually you'll have more money in a SIPP pension and stocks and shares in an isa.

One thing that outsiders who I've spoke to have said, is that they can't understand how the people and the city are inherently linked. Whereas Scousers feel a close connection to the city ie the city is them, this just doesn't happen in any other city apart from maybe Newcastle. In most other cities it seems to be a case that people just happen to live there; the connection to the city is much stronger amongst Scousers. 

Non-Liverpool people often find the 'scouse pride' thing at best bizarre and and worst annoying. It seems that scouse pride is the main thing that contributes towards peoples prejudices against Liverpool. For them, it appears narrow minded. 

Having said that, the consensus these days seems to be that as a city Liverpool is on the up. The vibe of the city is much better than it was even ten years ago, and my non-scouse friends often says that it rivals Leeds and Newcastle for a night out.

true,Max2tehPower,MX,mexico,"I'm seeing pessimism in a bunch of comments. Yes, we rely on City to lose two games (or lose one and draw one) at the minimum, which looks to be against Liverpool and Everton away, which seems possible after Arsenal held them at the Emirates. Chelsea have a very good record at Stamford Bridge, and though a draw may be a possibility, those remaining home games are against relegation candidates, so those teams will be trying to play for more than a point, with how close it is down there.  

Away is where Chelsea suffer the most. Swansea plays possession football, so there's a good chance that we may use that as an advantage. Cardiff will be the last challenge. If Chelsea beats Liverpool at home, which looks likely since Liverpool have to rely on their offense and dominance of the ball to win their games, then all Chelsea need to do to win it is beat Cardiff. If Cardiff haven't been relegated by then, then they will be fighting for their lives, which could work for us if they decide to go on all out.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am going to say something controversial that will no doubt be downvoted to hell, but I work in inner city schools.  The kinds of people reading this and indeed reddit are typically middle class parents who have both the ability and the interest to read that article.  You typically are pretty good at stimulating your kids' language skills.  You talk to them, you encourage them to interact with peers (who also have pretty good language and cognitive development).  Heck, you read with them nightly.

The children the government is talking about don't have those opportunities.  They may sit in front of the TV a lot more, have far less exposure to oral language because their parents are busy working 2 or 3 jobs, or haven't been exposed to a lot of language themselves as kids, or don't have the money to take them to exciting or informative activities.  

These kids come to school age 5 often with the language level of a 2 or 3 year old.  They are hugely disadvantaged before they even begin.  and they're slow to catch up.  Some don't catch up at all.  Their attention isn't there (you spend half the year trying to get them to sit still at carpet time), their language skills aren't there (and guess what? research shows vocabulary is a HUGE factor in literacy), their fine motor isn't there, and their social language skills aren't there.

The way in which the government (or at least, the media) is portraying this is way off in terms of the language they use.  It shouldn't be seen as 'starting school' - in fact, in countries such as Canada the 0-5 age range/development is typically under the health system.    It's more like 'extra optional stimulation' that should involve play, play, play, fun activities encouraging fine motor, gross motor, and teaching them how to play.  Sticking understimulated kids in a room with each other with no role models (because what upper middle class parents send their kids to the same daycare as the working class or immigrants?) is not enough.  They need to be shown HOW to play, how to ask questions, how to be creative (can't roleplay 'king' or 'queen' if you don't know what one is, for example).  They need  a stimulating, enriched environment, to go on fun outings and be taught vocab, to experience things their parents can't show them. These kids haven't had that stimulation, and don't deserve to be so far behind now and even more so later in life because of their parents.  Because these kids are statistically more likely to drop out of school, end up homeless or in jail, and that costs the taxpayer even more.  Noone is forcing anyone to make these kids attend, but it's too bad the general newspaper reading public can't read this, understand what a life of poverty is like, and recognise that yes, these kids need extra help, and if they don't get it, everyone will pay for it in the future one way or the other.

Next to Bath there is [Bristol](http://visitbristol.co.uk/). I would say that Bristol has a creative tint to it. After all this is the city that borne Banksy so it has some unique street art. Along with the street art, Bristol also has the SS Great Britain and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. It's also a good place for a night out.

Just south of Bristol you have the ""village"" of [Cheddar](http://www.cheddarvillage.org.uk/places-to-visit/). Cheddar boasts not only Cheese but also [Cheddar Gorge](https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/) (plus caves), Britain's oldest Skeleton, and the world's best Strawberries (go to the garden shop next to the reservoir for the best). Talking about Strawberries, Cheddar is also the start of the [Strawberry Line](http://www.strawberryline.org.uk/) which you can walk cycle all the way to Shepton Mallet. Also in the local area is [Wookey Hole](http://www.wookey.co.uk/) (IMO much better than the Cheddar Caves), [Wells](http://www.wellssomerset.com/), and [Axebridge](http://www.visitsomerset.co.uk/explore-somerset/axbridge-p500343). 

As you are coming in the summer you should go to [Devon](http://www.visitdevon.co.uk/)/[Cornwall](http://www.visitcornwall.com/) and have a lazy day at the beach or have a surfing lesson. If you go to Cornwall you could also go to Land's End. You could also take the ferry to the [Scilly Isles](http://www.simplyscilly.co.uk/). I noticed that you haven't been to [Wales](http://www.visitwales.com/), maybe go to [Cardiff](http://www.visitcardiff.com/)? I don't know if you have been but [NI](http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/) has some attractions like the [Giant's Causeway](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/giants-causeway/), [Belfast](http://visit-belfast.com/) or the Walled City of [Londonderry/Derry](http://www.visitderry.com/). There will be stuff happening if you go around the 12th of July, like marches, just be careful on what you do/say.

As others have said [Liverpool](http://www.visitliverpool.com/) is a great city. For [Scotland](http://www.visitscotland.com/) I think it's midge season but [Loch Ness](http://www.visitlochness.com/) might be an idea. If you just want to have a few days to get away from it all the [Sheltlands](http://visit.shetland.org/).

Though technical not part of the UK the [Isle of Man](http://www.visitisleofman.com/) has a motorbike event every June. If motor races are not your thing you can go hiking up Mt. Snaefell and see six Kingdoms. If you want something more continental [The Channel Isles](http://www.visitchannelislands.com/), they were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by the Nazi's during WW2.

I hope this will give you some ideas.

Edit. Just thought of [Glastonbury](http://www.glastonbury.co.uk/pages/) the hippy/woo city of the UK. See where Jesus' father Joseph is suppose to have stuck his staff and where the remains of King Arthur was ""found"". There is also the Torr which has a nice view at the top.

 ""*Breakfast - Done Properly""

1. Wake up in a Georgian country house with a hangover of biblical proportions. Slide your arm from beneath the slender alabaster neck of the recumbent debutante and silently pick your way through the detritus of last night's party to the kitchen.

2. As soft golden sunlight arcs low across the paddock and gilds the chromework of the Aga like melted butter, find a big pan.

3. Heat an unconscionable quantity of oil to a gentle simmer and slip in the freshly made local sausages. Sausages should not be pricked and never fried. The intention is that they should poach in the oil.

4. As the sausages poach make tea. If it is a proper farmhouse there will be a gigantic 'Brown Betty' teapot of the type used to fortify British battalions throughout the last Great Unpleasantness. Add a spoonful of leaf tea (need we mention the sordid subject of bags?) for each person and 'one for the pot'. At this point the kettle will start its song, beginning the process of gently awakening the recovering partygoers. Pour the water over the leaves. The tea serves the same purpose to a hungover Englishman that chicken soup serves to a Jewish New Yorker with a headcold and hives. This is not cooking...it's an emergency clinical intervention. An Englishman's mother will offer him tea as first response medical aid even if his arm has been severed by a combine harvester.

5. Move the sausages to the warming oven, pour off all but a light glazing of the oil and begin to brown the bacon. Much has been written about good bacon and I do not propose to repeat it. Suffice it to say...smoked...streaky...thin...crisp. Place in the warming oven when done.

6. Open a can of Heinz baked beans -accept no substitute- these are not so much a foodstuff as an architectural element of the finished plate. Think of beans as colour and a concealer of disheartening flashes of empty plate between meats.

7. Mushrooms and tomatoes may be grilled at this stage but no gentleman would consider eating them. They are vegetables. Vegetables are a form of table decoration. They aren't food - they go next to food. As the great Dr Johnson should have said 'Vegetables are what food eats' and I have no intention of disagreeing.

8. Americans eat hash browns at breakfast. Theay are disagreeable to an Englishman. I understand that the French, who can make food out of almost anything, use them to sole espadrilles.

9. There are many different ways to cook eggs but most of them are purely of interest to invalids, children and the feeble-minded. The correct or 'proper English egg' is fried with lightly browned edges in the fat left over from the bacon. At the last minute, oil is flicked over the top of the yolk to seal it. This dangerous procedure causes the yolk to form a perfect, golden, viscid capsule, the violation of which with a rough shard of toast, is the nearest that an Englishman will permit himself to unbridled sexual ecstasy.

10. While the eggs are being coaxed into tumescence the first of the walking wounded will have arrived in the kitchen. Ignore the bashful looks and tousled hair and administer tea in large quantities. Mugs enable fingers to thaw and many a tryst has been sealed by a coy glance over the chipped china rim. The more robust may be set to the simple task of toast.

11. Working quickly, lay down toast, top with an egg, flank with bacon and sausage and fill the spaces with beans. Serve forth.",0,1396594458,null,0,1396594639,0,cgjqy2n,t3_225ugg,t1_cgjqy2n,t3_225ugg,null,1433204052,60,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,60

What gouging? What are they doing that this law prevents them from doing? I've never had to pay a ""BBC iPlayer fee"" to my ISP and to my knowledge no ISP has never publicly considered the idea, despite being allowed to. What may happen in the US has no bearing on what may happen here, unlike them we do have a more competitive industry.

&gt; How about the fact that this law is going to enshrine basic, standardised access to the internet on equal footing for everyone in the UK?

When am I getting my free internet connection? I think you're giving it more credit than it deserves. Not a lot is going to change, because the things this law ""protects us from"" haven't even happpened over here. Except roaming charges, but that isn't net neutrality.

&gt;  How about the fact that the telecoms companies and broadband providers (in the UK at least) have been caught with their hands in the till time and time again, and have been attacked by Which? And offcom repeatedly over the years for over-charging and under-performing 

Why is this law going to prevent that? I don't see how it will. I don't think I'm going to believe Which on anything to do with internet access, they're the ones who believe providers can give guaranteed speeds despite it being pretty much impossible (everyone's line is different, you can't guarantee speeds to networks you don't own and control), it sounds like they know nothing about networking and all about grandstanding.

It's time the whole lot was dualled though. Temple is finally going to happen, it was a braindead decision to leave a 2 mile bottleneck in between two long stretches of dual carriageway and it's good to see that the council really wants it and that the government is for once happy to pay for it.

They seriously need to fully dual the A30 right down to Penzance (until they do, they're just shifting the bottleneck around), and build decent roads from it into at least St. Austell and Truro rather than pushing the traffic through several villages.

You'll find most of the places you'll want to visit on the axes of High Street and Cornmarket Street, but don't be afraid to wander further afield! Christchurch Meadow (accessible to the public on St. Aldate's St) is beautiful on a sunny day, as is University Parks (up Parks Road, just off Broad Street). Try and climb up the bell tower of the University Church, St. Mary's, as this commands an absolutely AMAZING view over all of the city. If you can sneak in, try and see the Oxford Union, because it's a masterpiece of arts and crafts architecture.

In terms of places to shop: if you're into books, you can browse in the enormous Blackwells for hours. Some unique places off the top of my head for gifts are Scriptum (Turl Street), which is the very essence of Oxford, Objects of Use (On a little road off of Turl Street), and Pylones (Cornmarket Street).

Food is generally good wherever you go, but some personal hilights are G &amp; D's (numerous, but the biggest are on St Aldates and Little Clarendon Street), Cafe Loco (opposite Christchurch meadow's entrance), Mission Burrito (St. Michael's St).

Also, top tip: don't buy any 'University' merchandise, as it's likely to be overpriced, cheaply made, inaccurate, and frankly it makes you look more like a tourist than the dreaded red caps.

No, and people can take reasonable measures in the defense of their own person. But isn’t this about that point where reasonable measures become un-reasonable?

The question is; do people have a responsibility not to put themselves in potentially dangerous situations? 

If a young woman agreed to meet a stranger off the internet in a remote location without anyone knowing her whereabouts, even though she would not deserve anything nasty which might happen to her, hasn’t she been irresponsible in exposing herself to such risks? Not criminally irresponsible; for that to happen you’d have to be putting someone else at risk of harm…

A middle age man soliciting sex from strangers in a deserted layby really isn’t any different.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"Agreed. My impression is that ""net neutrality"", on Reddit and other places, is basically ""anything I don't like about my ISP"" and that NN means that they'll suddenly get that gigabit service for free. The other angle is that people on Reddit who whine about their ISPs don't seem to know the first thing about networking and furiously downvote anyone who tries to explain why something might be why it is. It's also unhelpful, just as with the whole healthcare debate, to use the US as an example of how things will work here if we didn't have some sort of net neutrality legislation.

But if we look at the Netflix and Comcast/Verizon problem, I don't see how it would have stopped that. The problem is a lack of capacity between Netflix's ""ISP"" (Cogent) and Verizon/Comcast for the demand for Netflix (as far as I can tell, the EU proposal doesn't cover this), not deliberate attempts to throttle Netflix by either of them (which would be prevented by the EU proposal). Hence Netflix is dealing direct with Comcast instead of having to deal with Cogent, who are well known for their shitty peering and transit arrangements over the years. Cogent are cheap, and there's a reason for that.

I don't really understand how to read the EU document linked to in the article, but my impression of it is that at least one of the amendments actually allows the ISPs to charge for priority access to certain services, provided they don't degrade it for those who don't pay. How is that ""neutral""?

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"You have some funny ideas about efficiency. Cutting corners =/= efficiency. Streamlining processes and developing quick analysis tools increase efficiency, lying to say the job is done when it hasn't been done does not.

In the world of engineering, cutting corners and lying about it could lead to critical and possibly fatal incidents, which leads to criminal prosecution for gross negligence.

Even salespeople for engineering companies can't lie. We have things called contracts. No claim can be made without being backed up and without a clause for consequences if the promise is not delivered. Good salesmanship does not require lying.

Frankly, it's just really stupid from the employee's viewpoint too. If you lie on your CV and get a job (by lie, I mean an outright lie, like a fake degree or classification, not an exaggeration of how much you contributed to your last job), your entire career from that point is completely dependent on no one ever finding out you lied. If anyone ever found out, years down the line, they could destroy your entire career and credibility, even if you were a model employee otherwise. You can't just move on when people know you've done something like that.

Recently, there was a guy who took a job as a civil engineer without a degree in engineering (by lying about having one). He worked for over a decade with no problems or issues, he was by all accounts a good engineer.

The fact that it's creator has gotten in trouble regarding anti-semitism and people misuse it as such doesn't mean it is an anti-semitic gesture. The last thing the world needs is another gesture to use negatively. It is the governments and other establishments calling an anti-semitic gesture that are creating an anti-semitic gesture.

A gesture of anti-establishment in my opinion is a beautiful and powerful thing. And quite frankly, I am not of the opinion the Dieudonne is even anti-semitic. Hell, his first comedian partner is his childhood jewish friend. Antizionist is not the same as anti-semitic, and even if Dieudonne is, let the gesture hold its power as antiestablishment, rather than making it yet another way for people to demonstrate hate.

I find it absolutely ridiculous that Anelka got in trouble for making the gesture, and it will be even more so if Benny gets in trouble for tweeting about it.

Also, I know people here like to joke about Benny being stupid because of his tweets, but the man is actually quite intelligent and makes an effort to stay educated. He frequents museums in London, and his stance on football, while sad that he doesn't have the passion for the club like we fans do, is wise in a sense, and I do respect him for it.

And when you consider that a good deal of our team is people at the height of their physical fitness, it's also not surprising Brendan hasn't dipped into the bench more.

I'm certain Alberto deserves an opportunity to impress next season. His not ""breaking in"" this year has nothing to do with whether he can. Chelsea loan players out all the time - there's nothing saying we can't loan him out and bring him back with the intention to play, ala Suso.

Iago, I feel, is a bit more difficult position. We've probably gone further this year than Brendan or FSG anticipated. I think most of us felt that if we scraped 4th we'd have done magnificently. Instead we're in the title race.

I don't think this completely changes our intent going into the summer window, but it certainly makes it more likely that we're going to look for a top 3rd striker who we can get guaranteed goals out of. Leaving our 4th striker to likely be a young gun. 

If Brendan gets a look at Borini and Aspas this coming summer and thinks Borini could go out on loan again, maybe that opens up the slot. But otherwise I think it'll be tough for him to find game time. Especially when Luis and Sturridge are incredibly hungry individuals who never want (or really need) to leave matches.

It's not that Aspas couldn't become a 10-15 goal a season contributor across a few campaigns. It's that we might be able to find a 15 across campaigns guarantee.

But we all, as astute fans, must acknowledge that Aspas has essentially been in the Sturridge Chelsea situation. He can't get game time. It doesn't say anything about him as a player.

And it especially says nothing about Alberto as a player. Just give the lads time.

Helenius might also get some additional game time and we might see the return of Gardner soon.

Who knows, this injury might become a blessing in disguise for Villa. Benteke will certainly stay for another season now which is a massive positive and some young players will be given a chance. 

Our fixtures aren't incredibly tough, and thats were we tend to play a bit worse. Maybe some fresh new legs will make a difference.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"To be fair, they have both gotten a considerable number of their manifesto pledges through and coalitions compromise the constitutional value of election pledges and manifestos. 

For instance, if the UK elects a majority government then the Lords will pass any legislative which broadly consists of something which was in their manifesto. However, the House of Lords tolled the coalition partners that this would only take place if there happened to be something which was in *both* of their manifestos (effectively nothing). So the constitutionally legitimacy of their manifestos was weakened hugely and we, the public, have to accept a compromise between both of their manifestos. 

Furthermore, the main Conservative policy was cuts and a return to growth which they've (rather belatedly) been achieving. Whilst Clegg's tuition fee pledge obviously did go tits-up, there's a lot of smaller policies he has managed to get through. He promised a referendum on electoral reform, for instance. There's a lot of policy which protects children and schools. It was Lib Dem policy to remove innocent people from the crime register, which has been achieved. It's much smaller stuff than the Conservatives, obviously, but then the Lib Dems did only get 50 MPs and 20% of the vote compared with the Conservatives 36% and 300 seats.

We live in a representative democracy. The sooner we stop getting surprised that not every pledge gets implemented the better. That's just how the system works.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;The European Parliament has voted to restrict internet service providers' (ISPs) ability to charge data-hungry services for faster network access.

&gt;Operators have said the move would hinder their efforts to manage traffic.

Well that's a bold faced lie. Amendment 236 specifically addresses the issue between Traffic Discrimination (Price gouging) and Traffic Shaping (Ensuring quality). The wording is key and as follows:

&gt;Providers of internet access, of electronic communications to the public and providers of content, applications and services shall be free to offer specialised services to end-users. Such services shall only be offered if the network capacity is sufficient to provide them in addition to internet access services and they are not to the detriment of the availability or quality of internet access services. **Providers of internet access to end-users shall not discriminate between functionally equivalent services and applications.**

Amendment 236 preserves Traffic Shaping while stating that all similar service types, say Netflix video streaming, must be subject to the same restrictions as all other kinds of video streaming under that Traffic Shaping. It makes it illegal for NSPs and ISPs to block or restrict competing services. This is a good thing for consumers.

BBC - 0, Truth - 1.

&gt;The ""net neutrality"" proposal would put the EU at odds with the US, where video streaming service Netflix is paying the country's biggest cable firm for preferential treatment on its network.

It was a profoundly bad precident to begin with. Netflix were held to ransom by the cable firm meaning their customers couldn't access Netflixs' services in a reasonable manner. The American internet market is rotten to the core. It's akin to saying ""Mussolini might have been a fascist dictator but at least the trains ran on time"".

&gt;It would also prohibit mobile networks and broadband providers from blocking services - such as WhatApp messages or Google Drive storage - that compete with their own offerings.

Good!

&gt;However, the mobile and cable firms have warned that the law would also prevent them from being able to offer enhanced services - for example charging a movie site a fee to ensure that their 4K ultra-high definition films played smoothly on consumers' devices when they might otherwise stutter.

Why should the network providers be paid twice? Why should the customer pay for access, and then the content provider pay to have their service given fair access. I can guarantee we will all still need to pay for our internet connections, even though the companies are now double-dipping for payment. It's going to go on their balance sheets and there will be no tangible improvement for the consumer. Infact prices will probably rise as the Provider costs will need to rise too.

The logical conclusion for this argument is that you end up with internet 'Channels' where you pay £5 a month to access the Netflix link, £3 a month to access Spotify, £8 a month to access iPlayer / BT on Demand / Sky on Demand. All of this on top of the existing subscription fees. Sounds rubbish doesn't it?

&gt;""The current draft legislative compromise in the European Parliament reflects very restrictive views on how the internet should work and on how specialised services with enhanced quality could be offered.""

Specialised services for video and audio networking already exist for the people who consider these to be of high priority to them and their business. These types of network will not be impacted by the Net Neutrality legislation.

&gt;BT added that the UK's major ISPs currently operated under a voluntary code that promised to treat all traffic consistently, regardless of its source, which already provided ""an extremely strong safeguard for the neutrality of the internet"".

BT would eventually start charging non-BT customers £3 a month to access BT on Demand services on top of the normal subscription fee, simply because you're not using BT as the ISP. The same goes for Sky and Virgin. ""Everyone else is doing it, so why shouldn't we?"" it only takes one to move the market.

&gt;The proposal should mean subscription services - such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Blinkbox and Sky Go - do not have to face raising their own charges to take account of new data speed fees from the ISPs.

Huh? Hang on. Why is this statement buried half way down the article? Below the one about 'What they do in the US'?

&gt;However, with telecom and cable companies needing to cover the cost of infrastructure upgrades to cope with increasing data demands, one market watcher warned that consumers should expect bigger bills.

If only bandwidth had fallen rapidly in cost ($/mbit/month): http://i.imgur.com/U8XwRSD.jpg

Boo hoo. Raise your prices, change your network or die. That's how the high tech industry works. I'm happy to pay my ISP £25 a month for a service which fits my needs.

Overall, I don't think the article was *that* bad but it certainly leaned towards the negatives of Net Neutrality (loss of an opportunity to price gouge consumers and content providers) than the positives (ensuring barriers to entry remain as low as possible for internet companies).",0,1396602953,null,0,1396603229,0,cgjseh7,t3_22635q,t1_cgjseh7,t3_22635q,null,1433204736,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

If you do a new ISA investment you will normally invest in a new cash ISA any time after 5th April using money held in a current account.

However, like in your scenario, if your money is already held within a cash ISA then you are talking about doing an ISA transfer, not a new ISA investment. So your interest will always be tax free. If you wait until after the 5th April the only thing you have lost is the potentially higher rate on the new ISA.

Withdrawals will include transfers to a new ISA, so if you are still in a tie-in period with the Halifax then you might be penalised for moving to a new ISA provider.

&gt; So, what do I do? 

Okay. What do you want to do? I am saving for a house. In London. Which is... difficult and... frustrating

With your current assets and salary (assuming you are not in london [or outer london]) you could look at getting a property. A mortgage is pretty cheap debt and it could be a really good idea to buy a house and pay off as much as possible before they start raising interest rates (whenever that will be)

As a saver you are going to get screwed untill they start raising interest rates. But you have financial liquidity. If suddenly you wanted to spend £20k on something you can

Cash&gt;shares&gt;bonds&gt;property

Are on a gradient of security and stability. In relation to each other and within themselves (some shares are risker than others). Typically the safer the investment the less risk you would expect to take on and the smaller the expected return. Paradoxically there are particular bonds that might return more than shares, and vice versa blue chip stocks or utilities could provide a less risky investment than a bond

Asset allocation and general investing are interesting things to read up on. I really like [monevator](http://monevator.com/) generally. Especially the passive portfolios. An old rule of thumb is subtract your age from 100, invest your age as a % in bonds and the rest in stocks, the idea is that the portfolio will become very stable when you are near retirement and take the most risk when you are young and can afford to take them. Nowdays you might look at bundles of investments and diversify a bit. So I might set up a portfolio like this  
30%	FTSE 100  
10%	FTSE 250  
25%	UK bonds  
15%	Developed global equity (US, etc)  
10%	Emerging global equity  
10%	Gold  

And then rebalance that whenever I invest a significant amount or an investment grows or shrinks 4% from its initial weight

Source.

&gt;The ballot box is not a means of expressing some 'will of the public', it the means to legitimating and justifying the rule and domination of politicians.

If the interests of the public and the interests of businesses converge, what is the problem? It's the *people* who vote for politicians. Not the corporations. They can try and influence our vote, but they can't change it. If they influence our vote to the point where people change their minds, and people have been exposed to fair alternative points of view, surely we should just aspect that that is the will of the democratic majority?

However, many times has the public voted against or not voted for further rights to companies, for instance the European Parliament's vote yesterday on Roaming charges. I don't see how the electorate is merely a rubber stamp for big business. You're going to have to explain that much better.

2. 
 * Young full-back to play mainly on the left. Preferable if they are capable of playing both right and left sided. £15m
 * Young midfilder to play as understudy to Gerrard, Hendo and Lucas etc. Will Hughes is the best name that comes to mind. £20m
 * Winger/ST. Konoplyanka is still a possibility. £15m
 * Goalkeeper to be second/third choice. Playing in four competitions means we will need that extra cover. Hopefully we can find one on a free or negligible amount considering they are only backup. Perhaps Lukasz Fabiański who is available from Arsenal for free and is only 28 (not too old for a keeper) and would actually be proper competition for Mignolet. He's be a real coup.

3. Assaidi, Reina and Coates to leave. Perhaps only loan Coates out again but this time to a PL side. That is if a PL side would want him. Keep Aspas as 4 strikers is the optimum for fighting in 4 competitions (for a team that generally plays two strikers).

true,ChuckFH,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"It's a bit of a grey area, as this is non-commercial images that we're talking about.  

As a freelance photographer, I own the copyright to the images, but I would always require a model release from anyone identifiable in the images if they are going to be published for commercial purposes.  This clarifies two things; that the model is aware that the images will be published and the level of renumeration to be received.  This stops people coming back after the fact and claiming they didn't understand how the images would be used and demanding more money.  In the case of someone under 16, it also involves getting the consent of a legal guardian on their behalf.

There can also be licensing agreements that limit your rights, as author, to do as you wish with the images e.g. where a client has paid for exclusive use for a set period of time or has specified ""total buyout"" where they will pay to have exclusivity in perpetuity (which costs them a lot more money).  In these instances I wouldn't, for example, be able to put the image onto a stock library, to gain additional income from them.

On the privacy front, in the UK you are prohibited from taking photographs without permission somewhere that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. E.g. if I was to enter a person's garden and start taking pictures of them through their bedroom window, then I would be breaking the law.  I could, however take photographs of that same person walking down the street and then publish them, non-commercially without falling foul of any law.

Does the victim of the revenge porn have an expectation of privacy when, at the time, they (presumably) consented to have their picture taken?  As I say, a grey area.

Pterosaurs are often referred to in the popular media and by the general public as flying dinosaurs, but this is incorrect. The term ""dinosaur"" is restricted to just those reptiles descended from the last common ancestor of the groups Saurischia and Ornithischia (clade Dinosauria, which includes birds), and current scientific consensus is that this group excludes the pterosaurs, as well as the various groups of extinct marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs.[7] Pterosaurs are also incorrectly referred to as pterodactyls, particularly by journalists.[8] ""Pterodactyl"" refers specifically to members of the genus Pterodactylus,[9] and more broadly to members of the suborder Pterodactyloidea of the pterosaurs.[10][11]

&gt;Being patriotic is absolving yourself of critical thought

What a surprise, an ideology which promotes itself as the highest point of authority? Unheard of! But please do remember that we are talking about patriotism, not nationalism. A patriot is not automatically a nationalist.

&gt;Being patriotic is the assumption that you have more in common with 'British people' than with 'American people' just because they are British.

I don't understand this, are you implying that this is not the case? Please note that I am talking from a collective point of view, not an individualist point of view. Most certainly you will be able to find individuals from other countries who have more in common with you than people from your own country.

When you throw in other factors such as differing age ranges, you're going slightly off the point. Of course the country of residence is not the sole contributing factor in similarities between different groups of people. Age, sex, political leaning, wealth, race, and so on are just some of the other contributing factors. If you can accept these other factors, then why cannot you accept the country of residence as one of them? Could your aversion be ideologically motivated?

Completely agreed, I haven't seen him play as dangerous or as ""cutting"" as he once had. Is he underutilized? Maybe? But even though he's having an impressive season (as it is his first) I haven't seen him be as effectual as Schurrle has going forward.

&gt; I'm also looking forward to Salah as another option to Schurrle as the fast pacy winger however he can play on the other side of the pitch.

I wonder how Hazard would play in the middle with Schurrle on the left, and Salah on the right. That's a terrifying prospect, and something that will have to be experimented next season, especially given the acquisition of another solid CM.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"In principle, rail lines are what is called a natural monopoly. The reason being that really only one entity can control  and use the service. You can't have two entities controlling the same line as their schedules may clash, there is an issue over who gets the repair bills and so on. Plus unless you want the entire country covered in rail lines you can't allow every company to build it's own physical line. 

The way the government settled on combating thus and allowing competition in the private sector was the franchise system we know, love, and are also aware aware after the great Western line fiasco, isn't exactly reliable. 

To be honest I think all the system needs is to give the power back to the customers. The reason competition works well is because customers can easily lodge their displeasure. If the government and not the customer is the one terminating services the the people actually using the services need to petition a third party, unrelated to their use of the service, in the hopes of getting the service changed. Thus the train companies don't need to give. A shit about customers, just keeping the government happy. And if you answer to someone in the government who just wants a quiet life then just don't blow anyone up. 

On the other hand if part of the franchise agreement was to have an automatic review and audit of the providing company if more than a certain percentage of ticket buyers over a given period expressed dissatisfaction, that could put power back in the hands of the customer. This is just one way. Another could be a flat out petition. If more than 100,000 signatures arrive backed by ticket evidence of the trip, a review is made. Not ideal, but a step in the right direction.

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"Same as a Bailiff is not the same as a High Court Sheriff.

*Bailiffs*
&gt;Bailiffs have the right to take away some of your possessions (but not anything that you can’t live / work without) so they can be sold to repay your creditor(s). They could be court officials, or employed by a private firm.

&gt;In most cases, bailiffs wouldn’t get involved unless the case had already been to court because you couldn’t come to an agreement with your creditor(s) – although HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs) don’t need a court order to send bailiffs about VAT or income tax debts.

&gt;If you owe money for magistrates’ court fines, the bailiffs will have the power to force entry into your home to take away possessions. So will HMRC bailiffs, as long as they have a magistrates’ warrant.

&gt;County Court bailiffs (for other debts), can’t take anything behind a locked door (in your home, garage, shed, etc.) on their first visit, unless you let them in or they find an unlocked door or window. Once they’ve been in, however, they will be able to force entry on any subsequent visits in connection with that debt. 

*Debt Collector*
&gt;Although any contact from a debt collector should be treated as a serious matter, they are not bailiffs and it’s illegal for them to pretend that they are. They’re not court officials and they don’t have the right to force entry.

&gt;Creditors can instruct debt collectors – or sell them your account – when you fail to pay back a debt as agreed.

&gt;If they’re employing the debt collector, they’ll be hoping that you and the debt collector will reach an agreement so there’s no need to get the court involved.

&gt;If they’ve sold the debt to the debt collector, your creditor will no longer be actively involved in the matter. The ‘problem’ of getting the money back will be the debt collector’s – and so will the money.

&gt;Debt collectors have to follow the same rules as the original creditor. 

*Sheriff*
&gt; If you have a debt of between £600 and £5,000 (including court costs), you will seek a judgment in the County Court. Once you have this, you then have a choice for enforcement between either the County Court Bailiff or the High Court Enforcement Officer (HCEO).

&gt;Debts below £600 can only be enforced by County Court Bailiffs. Judgments for debts of £5,000 and over can only be enforced by an HCEO.

High Court Enforcement Officers (HCEO)

&gt;HCEOs are authorised by the Lord Chancellor and work privately or in private companies.

&gt;HCEOs work under the authority of a Writ of Fieri Facias (Fi Fa). This is issued when a County Court Judgment, Order or Tribunal Award is transferred to the High Court for enforcement via Form N293A and a court fee of £60. The transfer process normally takes between 5 and 21 days.

&gt;If successful, the HCEO will collect your judgment debt, your court costs, your £60 transfer up fee, interest at 8% and their fees, costs and charges from the defendant.

&gt;HCEOs earn their fees from the judgment debtor, but only when they collect. If the HCEO is unable to collect, there is an industry regulated abortive fee of £60 plus VAT paid by the creditor for each address visited. Other than the abortive fee, the HCEO receives no income for an unsuccessful enforcement.

&gt;As a result, HCEOs tend to have significantly higher collection rates than those of the County Court Bailiffs, who are salaried without any financial incentive to collect.

&gt;Unlike the County Court Bailiff, the HCEO does not have to give the judgment debtor any advance notice of their intention to collect, giving them the advantage of surprise. HCEOs are also permitted to force entry into commercial premises to enforce, a power not permitted to County Court Bailiffs.",0,1396617690,null,0,1396617972,0,cgjveei,t3_225o3r,t1_cgjveei,t1_cgjtsg4,null,1433206149,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I completely agree that palatinate needs to be able to show the Uni that they need to be aware of the image their decisions give to the rest of the world. They also suck at giving a larger proportion of their funding to DSU and that might actually help them be better. 

On the other hand, they give so much free reign when it comes to how you organize your time at the uni an actually do a great job at creating the opportunities for people to do what they want. The DSU has shown itself to be incompetent on a number of occasions, and working a lot on student theatre, it's had a massive impact on people just being able to do what they're good at. They don't even allocate a lot of the funding they do have and it's just ridiculous when you have all of these people who are essentially trying to prove themselves as a Lib Dem party candidates when they have bugger all training and have caused the DSU to go into massive amounts of debt. They signed contracts years ago which meant we don't even play our own radio station in the union building and have restricted opening hours so much that there is literally no reason to go to the student's union.  

I feel like yes, the Uni is becoming more of a cooperation, but they get stuff done. I honestly feel like they've done more to support extra-curriculars (which contribute to us having higher employment rates than any other uni) than the bloody students union itself. Some of the stuff the SU kicks up a fuss about is so damn banal too. They object to colleges becoming more centralised when it makes everything cheaper and has been going on for the last 3 years and no one has noticed. It's just so frustrating when all anyone wants to do is get a good degree, a good CV and get funding for the stuff that makes everyone look on us more favourably as graduates.",0,1396620990,null,0,false,0,cgjwmjg,t3_226db6,t1_cgjwmjg,t3_226db6,null,1433206728,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

From what I read the privatisation of the network has brought benefits, like increased number of services, new trains and more jobs. What it lacks is competent government support with large infrastructure upgrades, and a subsidy system that works, again something that is being poorly run by the government. Why should turning over control to the government result in increased efficiency or investment if this is the case?

Lots of private enterprises appear to have gone bust trying to either upgrade the network or increase capacity, so this picture that's being painted of greedy fatcats just interested in profit and not investment is also facetious, isn't it?

So in summary what you have is a badly planned and executed privatisation of the rail network in the 90's, sorry - badly planned and executed *by government*, the consequences of which we are still living with today.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"Actually it's not a third of the price since the pound has inflated massively since privatisation of the rails. The price of tickets has increased by somewhere in the region of 20-30% since privatisation. That's not an inconsequential amount, but given the chronic underinvestment that BR suffered from it was inevitable that large quantities of capital were going to need to be raised in order to carry out major works over several decades, as is being done.

It's not an accurate picture to just look at private companies as if all the increases in cost go to profit, because they don't.

People hear the old ""Privatisation is good because it creates competition"" and think ""How on earth can you have competition on the train lines?"" and I understand the question but what they're failing to take account of is that train companies aren't competing with each other. First Great Western aren't competing with Virgin, they're competing with Ford. First Capital Connect aren't competing with Arriva, but with Easyjet, and Scotrail not with Northern Rail, but with Megabus.

This *is* good for us as it means the companies are forced to invest significant sums of money to stay alive. BR never had that problem. Everyone uses BR? Ok whatever. No-one uses BR? Ok whatever. That's fine if you want a money sink which provides a poor, slow, late service. I don't, and while I do dislike the over the top variations in private rail prices, the fact that I can get a train for £15 return to my home 100 miles away if I book 10 days in advance seems pretty OK to me.

I can't see why a private company would want to risk a large scale upgrade or investment when they are already running a profit, particularly when the government will probably cough up the money at some point anyway.

The reason why British rail failed was the attitude of the government at the time to public services, other countries such as France and Germany appreciated the necessity of keeping the railways public but also use private sector funding. You can see this from the fact that SNCF and DB run many routes in the UK, the profits of which go back to be spent on their own domestic routes.

The private companies have done their part in improving services since BR and have been given plenty of opportunities to improve further but it seems that free market forces can only take this industry so far in the UK.

Contrast that with Mourinho calling his defenders 'ridiculous' and implying that he doesn't have any 'real strikers', and you see the true difference in quality between those two managers.  

My favorite thing about Rodgers is that not only will he own up to his coaching mistakes, but more often than not he'll fix them before the second half, and certainly before the rematch if he's able.  That feeling of steady improvement and working towards something great as a cohesive unit (i.e. 'team') is invaluable, IMO.

You can totally understand when you look at the finances and see that an SU is pumping 5k a year into a publication which, for a want of sensationalism, consistently berates them and FOIs the university to attempt to find fault.

Not that this is bad thing, but you can see the severe conflict of interest.

&gt; “Here’s the thing: I can change the future so long as the future has not already been established as part of my own past. I can’t rescue Amy and Rory because I already know that I didn’t.
&gt; 
&gt; “But what do I know about Trenzalore? There’s a big monument that looks very like my TARDIS. There’s a temporal fissure leading to my timeline. Maybe it’s my grave. Maybe, one day, it’s my burial ground. Maybe it is something else entirely, and we got it all wrong. Don’t know. Don’t plan to find out for as long as possible.

Enrique is 28, relies on pace and muscle, and now has a knee problem. Rodgers might be looking at other options as Enrique is pretty one dimensional offensively and prone to defensive lapses.

Don't get me wrong, I'm actually a pretty big fan of Enrique. He impressed seriously his first year and I thought he was quite good when Rodgers pushed him further up the pitch.

If you make such a bold statement you really need to back it up with facts. Your only reason can't be that you thought he was a weak candidate. 

No, that's not an accurate representation of my argument and what I thought of him as a candidate has nothing to do with this discussion. Objectively he had less experience and a weaker track record than other candidates. He was selected in spite of this because he was marketable and he was marketable for a number of reasons, including charisma, but the overriding characteristic was race. John Edwards was widely considered to be a more charismatic candidate at the time of the primaries, but didn't tick the race box and Hilary Clinton, despite not serving in the previous Clinton administration, was considered the most accomplished candidate. In the end the decision came down to whether to elect a female candidate or a black candidate, other considerations no doubt mattered to those aware of and actively interested in politics but at the end of the day race was the most important factor.

&gt; If race was the defineing [sic] reason for his nominantion [sic] and presidential win then why did a black man not become president sooner?

To be honest the title of the article, while accurate in a brute force sort of way, is utterly intellectually dishonest. The price of fares has increased by 245% - OK. But salaries have risen. I can't find the '93 figures, but in 1986 the average full time worker earned £3.87 per hour, in 2011 they earned £12.62 per hour (226% increase). Understanding worth and value in historical terms is a moderately complex thing because there's no single metric by which we can compare a cost in 2014 and a cost in 1993, however what can be clearly said is that to just say ""Well it cost £93 then and it costs £320 now so that's a 245% increase"" is grossly misleading to your average punter. It would be akin to saying ""Look at that guy, he used to drink 2 bottles of coke a day and now he drinks 8, the greedy bastard!"" while ignoring the fact that those 2 bottles of coke were 2 litre bottles and the 8 bottles are 1/2 litre ones.

edit: It's actually quite incredible how much things change. I recall mentioning my remuneration for my first real job to my father and he laughed and said what he'd been getting for his first job.

I never said you were, I feel I've either not been very clear or you're being deliberately obtuse.  I'm talking about blocking ISPs from bringing in tiered and priority access to internet services, something that is looming very large in the future of our transatlantic friends.

Because it will severely limit the amount of selective pricing and double dipping that the networks can get away with.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I'm not sure how to feel about the double charging because either way the consumer will probably end up getting shafted; if the ISPs can't squeeze more from the content producers to cover the costs of improving service, then they'll just fuck the customers even harder.

I'm not sure what information you've read but ISPs and NSPs are making normal profits. This isn't a fight for survival, it's a fight for bigger profits. In no way, at any point now or in the future, would these higher prices translate into faster infrastructure upgrades. It is solely lobbying for bigger shareholder returns. There is nothing good in this for the consumer or content providers. Even in something as homogenous as internet traffic, there is value in quality networks, and prices will reflect that. It might be capital intensive but that's what drives the industry.

The market is working as it should do already operating on Net Neutrality principles. These companies are trying to move away from those principles by introducing 'toll roads' on internet connections. This would introduce barriers to entry for new content producers and threaten the egalitarian nature of the internet.

&gt;And probably streaming content providers were passing their costs on to customers too, and I doubt they'll reduce their charges after this goes through. I guess the net result is that people who don't subscribe to streaming services will end up slightly subsidising those who do? (admittedly by a tiny, tiny amount)

The company I work for don't buy the debt, we follow the same rules as our clients and it's very tightly regulated by those clients, and regulators such as OFT/FCA (although it's now moved fully over to the FCA, which basically gives us the same guidelines to follow as the OFT used to) CSA, OFCOM, etc.

As an example, we have to approach vulnerable debtors in a considerate way. Offering financial advice, forwarding to debt management companies, negotiating something the debtor can afford based on their personal circumstances. Strictly speaking we don't want to, but we're regulated in such a way *we have to*.

Although our letters can be taken as very threatening in tone, our company can't essentially do anything at all. You know how much clout a debt collection agency will have based on the wording of letters. It's all ""may"" ""can be"" ""could possibly"" when it comes to the ""further action"" (another vague term).

It's a hard job to be genuinely, willing-to-help in. Sometimes the simple fact is someone will owe money and there's no disputing it. You can only do so much, but as a *debt collector*, we won't employ bully tactics or kick the door in to take your sofa if you don't pay.

true,theyeatthepoo,null,null,"&gt;No, that's not an accurate representation of my argument and what I thought of him as a candidate has nothing to do with this discussion

Here is what you said:

&gt;Seriously? He was arguably the weakest candidate in the Democratic primaries

Obviously that is a matter of opinion. In your opinion Obama was the weakest candidate. Its your opinion since you cannot state that candidates can be or should be objectively judged on their experience rather than say their vision. Thats a subjective argument, its your opinon. Therefore, it is only your opinon that Obama was a 'weak' candidate and it is therefore only your opinon that he primarily won because of race based on the fact that this must have been the case because he was the weakest candidate.

Obama came onto the political scene when he gave a speech at the democratic convention in 2004. He was not the first black democrat to give a speech but it was the first speech to really blow people away an imedietly elicited predictions that he would one day be president of the united states. 

Neither Edwards or Clinton could draw the crowds or the excitement that Obama could. Obama's politics where to the left of Clinton and most of the other front runners and it was for that reason that he outflanked them in a post Bush election and won. He also had a much better campaign which we built from the ground up. It meant that he got the votes out when it mattered. 

It was not irelevant that he was black but it was not the reason he won it. Just ask Hermain Cain.

People vote based on Jobs. They always do. It's the economy stupid. People do not vote for candidates, thinking that doing so may put them in a worse financial position, just because they think its neat that they are black.

&gt;Neither party nominated a candidate.

If race was the defining reason for his Obama's nomination and presidential win then why has a black man or women not been nominanted by a party sooner? When it comes to to presidential candidate nominantions its about what support you can get to make a bid, rather than being noimated by the party. So why has this not occured?

For example, if you can prove your incomings and outgoings with a budget sheet or something similar, filled in with aid of a certified financial advisor, you can fairly easily get something in place to repay any debts for a monthly figure, and that'll stop anything going further if you're willing to pay.

However, this can turn against you if you advise you're willing to pay and then don't. You can get yourself in a pretty deep hole if you agree to pay and flake on it, which essentially doubles the seriousness, as you would owe the money anyway, and owe the promise of repayment.

Even if it's something as useless as £1 a month, if you show you are willing to pay, and do - you should be fine.

He said the price has gone up by 20-30% after you account for inflation, not 245%. Adding 20-30% to £65 is £78-£84, so it has gone up by more than he claims. To get back to £100 you need to add 53%.

So that's it, adjusted for inflation, the prices of train tickets have gone up by 53%(ish, and assuming numbers are right). In other words for every 3 tickets you bought back then you can now only buy 2(again i think :p).

if i got the math right. £100 / 245 * 100 = £40.80.",0,1396636092,null,0,false,0,cgk3pfk,t3_226gki,t1_cgk3pfk,t1_cgjyd4j,null,1433210131,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"Provided you have studied a course of at least 12 months in length, your Tier 4 visa should expire four months after your course completion date.

During this four month period you can work full time provided you have finished your course, including handing in all outstanding course work and dissertations. You are subject to the usual student employment restrictions, so you cannot be self-employed, or a professional sports person or entertainer, and you cannot take a permanent vacancy.

At the end of the four months you must either leave the UK, or have applied for another visa. If you apply for a work visa (Tier 2), you may continue to work full time while the UKBA processes this.

From 6 April 2013 the requirements for a Tier 2 (G) visa are:

• You must find an employer willing to offer you a job and ‘sponsor’ you. The employer must be licensed to the UKBA.
• You must be offered a job which pays at least £20,300 per year
• You must have a Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD degree, or have completed the first year of a PhD. Postgraduate diplomas (unless a PGCE or PGDE teaching qualification) will not be accepted.

If you apply in the UK and you still have leave remaining on your student visa, your employer will not have to pass the Resident Labour Market Test. This means that your employer will not have to search the UK and EU job market and prove that you were the most suitable applicant, before they can offer you the job. Furthermore, your application will not affect the restricted numbers of non-EU applicants that your employer can offer a job to. This will make it much easier for an employer to offer you a position in their company.

Once you have submitted a Tier 2 application, you can take a permanent full time job while waiting for the visa to be processed.

If your application is successful, you will be given a visa valid for 3 years, which you can extend for a further 3 years. After 5 years, you can apply to settle in the UK provided you are earning at least £35,000 per year or if the job is on the Shortage Occupation list or it is a ‘PhD level’ job.",0,1396637061,null,0,false,0,cgk469y,t3_227lwv,t1_cgk469y,t3_227lwv,null,1433210352,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,otterdam,cnty-uk,Lahndahn,"&gt; Perhaps I am overly cynical and somewhat facetious about private companies but I still think that it is impossible for the best service to be provided to a customer on a railway line if a profit has to be made.

If you compare to airlines, it is absolutely possible to both make profit and provide varying levels of service. Some airlines fit out their planes very well and charge a premium and some cram them full with passengers to reduce the price. Private companies take on the risk of large investments if the risk of not investing is more severe (i.e. people choose the airlines with newer, nicer planes, fuel efficiency lowers price, and more).

But you will notice that it's only possible because there are quite a few airlines competing for your business, whereas on the railways you are lucky if you have a choice for your journey.

I really hope my heart makes it through the rest of the season, which is weird to say since I'm an extremely fit and healthy 26 year old.

Miles per hour is a poor unit to use when we consider our speed. This is because if asked to judge an hour we're not very good at it. We also struggle to judge a mile. At 30mph you're doing 44 feet per second or just a shade under 13.5metres per second. Doesn't sound so slow when you think about it like that. 

Consider that most built up areas have far more hazards than rural ones or indeed the motorway or dual carriageway and a heck of a lot can happen in in a second. 

Good machine control is not about how fast you can go. I could take someone who has a car licence but doesn't give a fig about motorcycles and teach them to ride at 100mph in twenty minutes. The mark of a good rider is that they make progress in a calm collected, safe, smooth and systematic manner whilst being unobtrusive. 

Want to go fast, take it to the track. Take some track lessons.

Normally, you should check with your GP's office (just call and ask reception, no need to speak to a GP). Ask for a travel clinic and they'll advise on what to do.

In my case, the practice has a travel clinic which is run by the nurses. I had to fill in a travel form detailing my plans and vaccination history, then got an appointment with the travel clinic nurse who told me what I need to get and administered the necessary meds. Some vaccinations require a course of treatment, not a one off, so **make sure you sort this out at least a month before you go!**

Going to Malaysia, you'll probably need some vaccinations on top of the UK requirements and these will not be free. But unless you're going to one of the high risk malaria or rabies areas, it shouldn't cost too much. 

Also, **make sure you get good travel insurance cover for your trip!** The kind that will airlift you out if you need treatment that is not locally available is highly encouraged.

&gt;

&gt;The __Heysel Stadium disaster__ (pronounced: [ˈɦɛizəl]; [Italian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *Strage dell'Heysel*, [Dutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language): *Heizeldrama*, [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Drame du Heysel*) occurred on 29 May 1985 when escaping fans were pressed against a wall in the [Heysel Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium) in [Brussels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels), Belgium, before the start of the [1985 European Cup Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_European_Cup_Final) between [Juventus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) of [Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) and [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) of England. Thirty-nine people—mostly Juventus fans—died  and 600 were injured. [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;Approximately one hour before the Juventus-Liverpool final was due to kick off, a large group of Liverpool fans breached a fence separating them from a ""neutral area"" which contained Juventus fans. The Juventus fans ran back on the terraces and away from the threat into a concrete retaining wall. Fans already seated near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed. Many people climbed over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the disaster in order to prevent further violence. 

&gt;The tragedy resulted in all English [football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) clubs being placed under an indefinite ban by [UEFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) from all European competitions (lifted in 1990–91), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional year and fourteen Liverpool fans found guilty of involuntary [manslaughter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter) and each sentenced to three years' imprisonment. The disaster was later described as ""The darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions"".

If you start with Series 5 you miss out on a HELL of a lot. You miss the entire runs of two of the most popular Doctors and you miss a lot of the world building that Smith's era falls back on from time to time. Especially in the case of the Time War. 

Adding to that, I have to disagree with you. Moffat can spin a concept like no one you've ever seen, but while he's been showrunner everyone of those concepts has fallen flat on overused cliches and deus ex machina. Moffat's writing since he became showrunner (bar TEH) has to be some of the clumsiest I've ever seen. 

Stick with the series OP, it has a few ridiculous cheesy moments (especially while it's re-finding it's feet) but there's a lot of real quality which you'll be talking about for years after.

People not getting back to you about CCTV, forensics taking forever to come back, witnesses who don't turn up when asked even though they agreed to. These can all cause major headaches. You might have to spend two or three days on a single case and there is no guarantee that you will catch the offender.

 So say you get ten crimes a month and you're actually dedicated to detecting crime. You're not a detective. You also have to be in the community on high vis patrol, you get abstracted for police aid (think football matches), crime scenes, cell watches and so on. You also have to take crime reports and enter them (entry alone can take upwards of an hour except in the simplest of cases). This is the reality a lot of officers are dealing with. 

Want me to detect three crimes a month, no problem I'm going to need not be expected to do all the other stuff as well. But that is the reality being faced by a lot of officers. The crime reports they're getting are not always that simple either.

It's also not very interesting to me. EU or no EU the UK isn't going to become Somalia and I'm very much hoping that in the next 50 years we'll have moved away from the employment-&gt;reward mechanism as economic driver (probably just dreaming).

What's a more interesting debate is what effect a federal EU would have and whether it's desirable since that's now quite openly the ultimate aim of the pro-EU politicians. 

Is there any reason other than economic for me to give a crap about the citizens of another EU country? If national identity continues to be eroded by mass movement of citizens then what replaces it? Are some countries destined to simply feed professionals to other nations leaving them permanently disadvantaged? The list goes on and on.

Loads of questions to be answered, but since every one is a political minefield you won't see these issues being debated.
