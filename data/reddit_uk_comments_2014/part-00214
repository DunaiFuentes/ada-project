true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"&gt; One big fear with decriminalisation, which is something that you have mentioned, is the idea of this pot smoker lifestyle taking over with everyone becoming lazy feckless wastrels smoking weed all day

No , I want to make my experience perfectly clear. Some people turn into problem smokers some don't.  Cannabis is pleasurable because it directly stimulates the reward mechanisms on the brain. For some people, after prolonged use they seem to become less able to get pleasure out of life without pot.  Like I say it happens to some people and not to others. 

With regards to the Dutch. I have heard that they live a very different life. The family is far more important and kids are less often left to their own devices like in Britain [source](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6360517.stm). In Britain we tend to have a ""how much can you take?""/ ""prove yourself"" attitude to our alcohol which is different to the continent's attitude of ""drink is there to be socialable"". If we legalise pot we may end up with kids trying to out do each other like they already do with alcohol rather than taking the continental attitude. This is the problem with cross cultural comparisons. The amish or the mormons in utah could legalise pot and the uptake would be very low because of their religious beliefs. This doesn't mean the uptake would be low in britian. 

&gt;What are your thoughts on heroin legalisation?

Most heroin users would have had a lot better lives if they never met the stuff.  Legalising is to a certain degree legitimising. Here is the problem as far as I see it.  A heroin habit is expensive. It starts out at £5 a night and quickly rockets to £45 a night( With is £300+ per week ). The cost is why most heroin addicts steal.  If we lower the cost of legal heroin more people are going to take it and get addicted, if we raise the cost addicts are going to have to steal more.  So the only option to lower ""getting money for drugs crime"" is to give it away to addicts for free. The problem with that is to make sure addicts don't lie, stock pile, sell or overdose is that it has to taken in supervised conditions. Running injection galleries free for addicts is problematic and free heroin will attract users to claim they are addicts for a free hit. The other option is what we have now which is methadone. With methadone you have a heroin substitute that is clean and can be taken in a pharmacy without needles and is swallowed so is difficult to stock pile. Methadone is NOT perfect, a lot of addicts on methadone do go out and take some heroin once a week or once a fortnight but taking heroin occasionally means they don't need to steal to feed a daily habit. This so far seems to be the most workable solution.  Methadone is easy to administer vastly reduces heroin use and heroin related crime. Few people are going to claim to be heroin addicts just to get some methadone.  Methadone isn't perfect but until something perfect comes along it's probbaly the best we have. 

   The problem I have with heroin, crack and methamphetamine is that a high portion of users develop crippling addictions. That's why I think society would probably be better off without crack meth and smack.  Cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana are different. Far higher proportions of users CAN do an occasional night and never develop a problem. 

I know it sounds a little bit like I'm coming down on the side of the status quo but I do believe that the status quo isn't derived from carelessness, stupidity or dogmatic entrenched positions. There are a lot of clever, caring people trying to reduce the problems of drug use and trying to balance the harm of drug addiction and problem users with the reality of modern recreational drug use. It's out of this balance that the status quo is made. ",0,1406337504,null,0,false,0,cj7zipr,t3_2bkksg,t1_cj7zipr,t1_cj7jeqz,null,1434902624,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It doesn't says whether it's causative or incidental, that's true, but the poster just says that 1/3 rapes happen when the victim has been drinking. Maybe most of those 1/3 happened when the victim had had only one drink, which hardly makes them more vulnerable. How many of the rapes happened when the victim was impaired enough for them to be more vulnerable?

I definitely don't buy the ""misconstrued signals"" argument as an excuse either, and that was a bad point that I didn't really think through. The alcohol could make a difference as to whether someone with the potential does commit the act though. Some people are more violent after drinking, and someone could be more likely to violate someone's boundaries after being inebriated. Both would be examples of people committing acts already in them, but both could well have not occurred if the offender hadn't been drinking.

And your points only underscores the gravity of the situation in Palestine for me. The Ukraine conflict is much less old than the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, so is the Syrian conflict. Both countries are fighting to keep out foreign invaders and both have similar occupied territories like in the Israel/Palestine conflict.

The Israel's have occupied land since 1967, UN resolution 242 has not yet been dealt with. The blockades in place don't only seize weapons but deny the Palestinians enough basic necessities to function as a society and they still rely on huge international aid, even in peace time. It's in the Likud charter to deny the Palestinians a state, you know like Hamas has said they don't recognise Israel but when have you heard of that side of the story?

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Likud#Charter

They reject a Palestinian Arab state and go on to say what is still happened right now.

&gt;""The Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river. The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign state. Thus, for example, in matters of foreign affairs, security, immigration and ecology, their activity shall be limited in accordance with imperatives of Israel’s existence, security and national needs.""

They continue to use the blockade as an economic sanction so they can never form a nation and they continue to expand the amount of land which the claim for settlers. If that continues, what will eventually happen? That is the main reason why Hamas continues it's campaign and the reason why they are supported by some of the people in Palestine.

Foreseeable issues: Kaboul is chronically injury-prone.  Lennon will not be happy to drop so far in first-team preference, nor (likely) will Townsend.  Nor Rose.  I'm not certain Vertonhen and Chiriches will do well together, so I've slotted Vlad in as second-choice behind Jan, but obviously if Jan is starting every match then Vlad will need regular playing time as well in order to get better at playing with him.  For his wages and because I think we really ought to be going all-in on Soldado for the time being, I think Ade gets shifted out, in which case we need a bit more depth at striker.  And I suspect a lot of you will dislike how far down in preference I've placed Holtby; frankly, I don't know if there's a place for him, and he may be the best make-weight we potentially have if we want to bring in someone at LW or CB.

Let's just work it out a sec, I work behind a bar in didsbury, it's nothing fancy just a standard pub. At £6.50 per hour (which is actually a little higher than I get I think) I'd have to work about 9 hours for £57 to attend the Liverpool game. I also need to get there, so add an extra hours work for transport. 10 hours. Match programme and a bite to eat, an extra hour. Let's not forget my Cityzen card at £35, add another 5 hours. Now so far this is 16 hours. Because my pub has a lot of staff, mostly students, it tries to split shifts evenly resulting in us struggling to do more than 40 hours per week. After attending the city match I have 24 hours of work left for the week to help pay the bills, rent, car insurance, fuel, travel to see my girlfriend, food and social activities. Yesterday I did a 10am - midnight shift just to try and earn some extra money so I can buy my bro a birthday present. 

Now I know our season tickets are very reasonable but in my sort of job I can't get every Saturday or Sunday off, in fact I've not had one off yet since May. 

Maybe I'm just ranting but with this level of inflation in a season or two it will probably be cheaper for me to go on holiday for a week than attend the handful of city games I manage to get to throughout the year.

Recently though I have started to play again with friends and hopefully in a friendly league next summer, and to actually watch matches. I will admit this is mostly due to a few great World Cup matches that I watched, and it really pulled me in and made me want to watch. I was rooting for Spain, which is odd because I have absolutely no relation to any Spanish people, I just gravitated to them. 
Anyway, me and a few friends decided to add football to our sports list (most of them watch NFL but I don't enjoy American or Canadian football) which was mostly just hockey. So we decided the Premier League would be the best to watch, time zone wise and talent and language as well. We all figured we would choose our own favourite teams in the league and I chose Liverpool almost immediately. I like the players, especially Sterling, the logo, the chants, the colours even the name Liverpool sounds awesome to a simple Canadian. And the history. I am a Montreal Canadiens Fan, oldest team in the NHL and the most Stanley cups as well, so Liverpool's history makes me feel all warm inside. 
I read your post and I was just wondering if fans like me are considered band wagoners and treated like shit or do I just dive in?

I've done it to smarter cunts than you; and it usually gets results (angry quotes; fluster photographs; days in court). Aim of the fucking game; dickhead.

If your talking about terms like ""turnover"" and other terms such as ""trikeration"" (shudder) that come straight from football or some other sports, then your thinking makes sense and I compeltely agree.  However the term cleats is what Americans in all sports call boots. That isn't something taken from football, its just what we call them here.  To call that ""nonsensical"" or ""bastardiseing"" is nothing short of being intolerant of another culture.  It's a different word used the same way.  It has nothing to do with inteligence.

Terms like outside back, PK, soccer,  and the like are American terminology that again isn't taken from other sports.  It's used the same way and its just what we call it.  It has nothing to do with inteligence.  I am a huge fan of the  Premiere League and as such I find myself using words like boots, pitch, fullback, and similarly British terms.  I don't see that as a problem.  I don't like American fans that only use the British ternminology and look down on other people for not using it.  I think that is elitist and harmful to the sport as a whole.  However I also cringe the same way you do when an American who doesn't fully understand the sport doesn't know the correct terminology.  

This is the part I'm going to get downvoted for in this sub, but I don't care.  I think that English people who look down on Americans who correctly use American soccer terminology just because its different than them and accuse them of something like ""basterdising the sport"" need a reality check.  It's the 21st century.  England is no longer a world power in soccer.  Your best will beat our best more often than not.  However I would feel comfortable stepping on the pitch as a player or coach against your average English fan (or any other country's soccer fan for that matter).  I live and breath this sport.

&gt;Map of average property prices paid in 2013 in England and Wales. Based on price-paid data from the Land Registry.
&gt; 
&gt;Sales were binned by postcode into 1km x 1km squares aligned with the OS National Grid, and the average taken for each cell.
&gt; 
&gt;Colourised by quintile; blue is cheapest 20%, white is mid-price, red is most expensive 20%. There' were around 780,000 sales, with around 16 sales per km^2 cell on average.
&gt; 
&gt;Rendered in QGIS; data munged with a Python script and SQLite.

On the blue end of the colour scale, other than the obvious North/South contrast, the Welsh valleys stood out to me. Mostly old mining towns, I think. On the red end of the scale, if you [view the original size](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stevefaeembra/13990751023/sizes/o/), you can't help notice that London hardly has any low-end parts at all anymore. There's like two pixels of lightest blue around ... Brixton, I guess, and a smidgen of blue around Tottenham; much of the traditionally poor Eastend is obscured by the letters, but eyeing the little you can see it seems like you have to go beyond Barking to get to any blue.

Lazy question: what's the patch of blue midway between Bath and Oxford?",0,1406347052,null,0,false,0,cj83ajb,t3_2br5xh,t1_cj83ajb,t3_2br5xh,null,1434904509,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I can probably live with cleats in all honesty since that is just apparel, but when people bastardise actual football terminology it isn't me being elitist, it is me losing the identity and culture of football. This by definition is bastardising the sport. Don't be offended. It is reality.

Every other English speaking footballing nation (look at Ireland, Australia, etc) use the same terminology. So why can't Americans? It's just lazy. What it feels like to me is an imposition of someone else's sport onto ours. This isn't NFL or NBA. This is football.

There's a big difference between what I said (a person using American sport terminology for football gives the impression that they don't know what they're talking about) to what you said (if I use American sport terminology it doesn't mean I am unintelligent). It has nothing to do with intelligence but everything to do with adapting to the culture. 

For Americans, yes this is a new and shiny sport, but don't forget that tactics, analysis and terminology has adapted and evolved over a hundred years. 

And please, what you're saying about you being a better footballer than an average English fan is ridiculous. I bet I've got a bigger knob than you. Don't let this get so personal. But lets be clear on this: in terms of professional football, there is a gulf as wide as the ocean when it comes to talent between England and America. 

The advantage the Americans have in this sport is that they aren't weighed down by their history. Watching the USA play is refreshing because whilst the quality of play and tactical awareness is quite poor, they are positive and run around a lot. There were a bunch of teams like this in this WC - Costa Rica are a good example but so too are Algeria and Iran. It is great to watch.

I'm not looking down on you because you call it ""soccer"". You know that the Brits coined that word, right? I don't think I'm even really looking down on anyone anyway. I'm just not willing to engage with people on this subject because it seems to me that they don't know what they're talking about.

&gt;

&gt;The __bootstrap paradox__, or __ontological paradox__, is a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) in which information or objects can exist without having been created. After information or an object is sent back in time, it is recovered in the present and becomes the very object or information that was initially brought back in time in the first place. Numerous [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) stories are based on this paradox, which has also been the subject of serious physics articles. 

&gt;The term ""bootstrap paradox"" refers to the expression ""[pulling yourself up by your bootstraps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping)""; the use of the term for the time-travel paradox was popularized by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein)'s story *[By His Bootstraps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By_His_Bootstraps)*.

Paulinho as first choice in midfield is a bit of wishful thinking, as I *do* think he has serious potential and I'm frustrated by the generally middling quality of most of our 2013 signings.

Now, the risk is that a player sees the competition he faces for his spot, becomes demotivated, and declines precipitously in quality (I'm looking at you, Gomes).

true,Domhnallbain,null,null,"""Rightfully"" Northern Ireland should have been smaller than it turned out. An Independent Irish State was declared to be legitimate due to the huge vote Sinn Fein got in the 1918 general election. However several areas which voted for Sinn Fein had their votes ignored, namely Counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry City. So while many people who voted to live in an Irish Republic were denied their rights, virtually nowhere that voted to remain in the UK experienced a similar injustice (apart from the Trinity College Dublin constituency).

As a Donegal man I believe we have suffered more neglect than any other one of the 26 counties due to the presence of the border. While I have considered that Donegal may have possibly benefited from better infrastructure if it had been included in Northern Ireland, on the other hand it probably would have been an incredibly violent place if it were a part of the North during the Troubles, due to the terrain and the population (Think South Armagh x10). So I think we got lucky really by not being part of Northern Ireland

However the main reason Northern Ireland isn't any bigger is because if it was it would cease to exist. If Northern Ireland were to be made up of the 9 counties of Ulster, then the Nationalist population would greatly outnumber the Unionist population and would have likely been united with the rest of Ireland a long time ago. The 6 county state was created for the specific reason to prevent the Nationalist majority from gaining control of Ulster.",0,1406356426,null,0,false,0,cj86dw3,t3_2bre07,t1_cj86dw3,t3_2bre07,null,1434905957,13,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,13

Ask for a two or three year long lease with a six month break clause; I've been able to negotiate such and in so doing only had an interest rise of something like £12 a month in year 3.

Don't hope, check up. Ask the estate agent how many properties your future landlord owns. Tell them that you're only interested in professional landlords, not small time landlords.

&gt;Can you elaborate on what a six month break clause is? Sounds UK-specific.

It's pretty normal in the UK to have year-long leases that you cannot get out of; however, because I have had some awful neighbours in the past, I have always insisted upon having a six month break clause. This gives you the ability to give notice at month 5 to end the lease at month 6, or anytime after the 6 month period with a month's notice should you so choose. Managing agents are usually pretty okay with this if you explain that you are worried about the unknown; you can't predict moving into a place that has terrible neighbours who keep you up all night, and you really do not want to be locked into a year long lease if that turns out to be the case. This did not affect my ability to negotiate another two years on my lease once I'd been there for six months, fyi.

&gt;This is a great idea. What other sort of things can I do to win over a landlord's/managing agent's peace of mind?

If you want to negotiate a two or three year lease with minimal rate rises, you could voluntarily provide them with your last year or twos bank statements showing a regular income and on time rent payments. I don't know if it's specific to the last place I rented, but their forms stated that I wasn't allowed to rent a place over 33% of my income; they also wanted a personal guarantor because I had been in my job for less than four months. However, you may be able to negotiate on these points with enough evidence.

&gt;In traditional [Chinese culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_culture), ___qi___ (more precisely *[qì](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Tones),* also ___chi___, ___ch'i___ or ___ki___) is an active principle forming part of any living thing.    *Qi* is frequently translated as ""natural energy"", ""life force"", or ""[energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(esotericism\)) flow"". *Qi* is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) and [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts). The literal [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation) of ""*qi*"" is ""breath"", ""air"", or ""gas"".

&gt;Concepts similar to *qi* can be found in many cultures, for example, *[prana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana)* and *[cit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cit_(consciousness\))* in [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu) religion, *[mana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana)* in Hawaiian culture, *[lüng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_(Tibetan_Buddhism\))* in Tibetan Buddhism, *[ruah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruah)* in Hebrew culture, and [Vital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism) in Western philosophy. Some elements of *qi* can be understood in the term [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(esotericism\)) when used by writers and practitioners of various esoteric forms of spirituality and [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine). Elements of the *qi* concept can also be found in Western popular culture, for example ""[The Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force_(Star_Wars\))"" in *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars)*.  Notions in the West of *[energeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality)*, *[élan vital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital)*, or ""[vitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism)"" are purported to be similar.

How about planning to retire in 15 years, and looking at a mortgage where you are for that duration?

Even if you have to downsize, you'd build equity that you could then use when you retire to relocate to a larger property in a lower cost area.

Regardless of the apparent futility of reigning in your spending, I would strongly suggest doing so. The housing market isn't a guaranteed one way bet, and the more money you have to throw at any opportunities the better, and in the mean time, you can at least get some return on it.

£40000 is about 2,500 after tax, or 1700 after rent. With that kind of income, if you can get your spending under control, the visa debt is very easy to repay, and you could build some sort of deposit in fairly short order if you really pulled your finger out.

Could you at that point look at a BTL, with a view to liquidating that to provide capital when you retire?

Buying clothes in charity shops is a good idea, there are plenty in most towns. Obviously prices vary but when I worked in a shop in Cardiff a decent pair of jeans would be maybe 5-8 pounds and a shirt about four.

I think it would be possible for you to get some work, I would recommend having a look on Gumtree to see what people are looking for in whatever area you're thinking about. Plenty of people wanting to learn languages and tutoring is the kind of thing that you can do without official channels - there are no official certifications  needed for someone to provide/advertise private tutoring services.

You might also be able to find cheaper living if you look at lodging with a family, or someone who needs a house sitter/live in cleaner. It's not necessarily that easy to find but I believe the opportunities do exist. I know someone who came over from Germany to study and lived very cheaply in an elderly lady's house in return for helping her with house work, Shopping, etc. Au pairing could also be a possibility but idk if that's harder for men. Also see what's about on air bnb.

That's all my advice for now but best of luck!

£27m Shaw, £25m for Lallana (-25% for Bournemouth, so 6m) and £4m for Lambert = £56m.

If we add in the current two strong rumours of Lovren for £20m and Chambers for £16m, that brings our total income to = £92 million.

So far our expenditures are £11m on Tadic and £8m on Pelle, which is only = £19m. 

So really we have only just scratched the side of what must be a huge pile of cash [a la the Dark Knight](http://cf.badassdigest.com/_uploads/images/day_4_zn.jpg). Without some investment soon people are going to seriously (and I mean seriously) doubt the intentions of our board. We could literally throw £30m at a marquee signing right now and still have enough for some good deals on players to replace those we've lost AND provide depth. Instead they seem to be struggling to sign anyone, with so few rumours persisting beyond a Daily Star report of ""interest"" that most of us don't really have any idea who might be next.  

Also, if true that Fraser Forster and Nathan Redmond have both been bid on had them turned down, then you've got to ask what the board are playing at to not be able to get the bid done quicker. At present money is not an issue for us. Yes, have discussions, but teams know we're in the money and in need right now, plus if we're bidding a ""derisory"" figure for players like Forster, then it comes across as the board trying to save too much money... for what?

Unless we soon see a real influx of players, at least 3, and I'd want maybe 6, then we really don't have what I would call a strong team to line up with at the start of the season, and will just get held to ransom on the last day of the window where we may or may not buy anyone anyway, leaving us in a possible bad position for the whole year.  

Only shining light is obviously our youth, who have been doing OK in the friendlies, some of them doing great in fact. But everything can't fall to them, especially not with most of them at 18. Koeman did wonders at Feyenoord with youth, but this isn't the Eredevisie, and the PL will destroy us if it comes to that. Look at Villa a few season's back, no decent investment, had to rely on youth all season for both squad and depth, and have been in or near the relegation scrap since. Same happened to us after a season in the Championship, because we were in such financial trouble.

I imagine you'd be able to find a landlord who'd be willing to do that without too much trouble - they don't want vacant periods, after all. (Usually my negotiation has been the other way around - getting a two month rolling notice period after six months rather than a full year tenancy.)

Of course, some of the letting agents might be less keen as they tend to get fees on signing a new agreement each year, but it should be doable. If an agent tells you something can't be done, insist they actually ask the landlord (sometimes it's just stuff the agent doesn't want to do, rather than something the landlord has a problem with).

Oh, and on the subject of UK tenancies, watch out for any tenancy which prescribes particular utilities suppliers. There's a particular near-scam where the agent gets you to use overpriced energy/etc suppliers who give the agent a kick-back.

Word of warning for you: get a very detailed inventory. If your landlord does not want to provide one, pay to get one done yourself, or do your own and get them to sign it. Our landlords are notorious for trying to steal deposits, and most people just suck it up and reach a half way agreement when in fact the damage is ordinary wear and tear. I go over inventories with a fine tooth comb, even including details such as 'no manual provided' for domestic appliances; if your washing machine breaks and they haven't given you a manual, fine. If they have, they can hold you responsible.

Another example: a bathroom had an extractor fan (underneath the shower head) to get rid of damp because it had no windows in it, but the string had a brass fitting on it. One day I turned it off and it pinged out of my (wet) hand and cracked a tile. The landlord wanted to charge me £700ish to re-tile the ENTIRE BATHROOM when I gave my notice. It was only due to a very vigilant inventory person that I was able to argue that putting a very heavy fitting in a slippery bathroom area was daft, and kept my money. 

Happy to send you photos of the way I marked up my last inventory if it helps you get an idea of what to do. ",0,1406363851,null,0,false,0,cj87zyk,t3_2brdtn,t1_cj87zyk,t1_cj86hn5,null,1434906903,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

They haggled over Ulster being in home-rule or not. The UUP wanted all of Ulster and the IPP wanted all of the island. The compromise was the six counties but was never actually enacted.

Fast forward to the War of Independence and in an attempt to alleviate the problem Westminster created two home rule autonomous regions called Northern and Southern Ireland. The Southern Parliament was boycotted but it put in place the border we know today.

Then during the talks for the anglo-Irish treaty Craig, who wouldn't show up to the talks in person, was offered all nine counties for exclusion from the Free State but he rejected it as he knew he could not hold NI without a good majority and so the old compromise deal was used again.

We lived in a Victorian house split into four flats, so a common one was ""I'm visiting someone upstairs"" - so I'd ask who ask I knew everyone in the building, and it would change to ""...after I've been up the shops"".
""Very nice, but *who are you visiting?*""...and on it would go.

One woman wouldn't give up, and after complaining that she had to park somewhere, so we quickly went from a polite ""sorry, this is a private drive"" to shouty replies like  ""Where am I supposed to park, then? I need to go shopping""?

My reply was along the lines of ""Where does your parking problem become mine? This is my front drive! Fuck off!""

She then started on ""You can't threaten me, black mother on her own with a child""

""What? What are you talking about? What does that have to do with parking on someone else's drive? Why don't you call them police, and tell them a complete stranger is getting upset because you're parking on his drive? Fuck off!""...and so on.

When my Wife did it, we had one guy who then kept saying ""Send your man out .Tell him to ask me to my face"" and stuff like that, which was difficult as I was at work.

Watching Last Week Tonight previously, they have targeted powerful companies/governments trampling on peoples' rights, the hypocrisy and corruption of FIFA, human rights abuses in Africa - you get the general idea. They highlight hypocrisy, corruption, misuse of power, etc in a funny way.

This segment just seemed a little cheap to me. I'm no huge fan of the Commonwealth Games, but it is fair to say it means something to alot of people, its partnership with UNICEF and many other charities is very laudable and it brings together people who have a common history (good, bad, awful, great) - people choose to participate and get excited about this event.

Alluding to the idea of it just being a copy of the olympic games events, but less good, yet, they then go out of their way to list sports that are definetly not in the olympic games: bowls, mountain biking, squash, etc and then slag those off. Don't abandon your argument mid sentence!

I'm sure I can be accused of not having a sense of humour about it, but I love John Oliver's show when it picks the right (usually horrible) targets... but this segment is the kind of thing that me and my friends used to say to each other when we were sulky teenagers about things that we thought were uncool. huhuhuh look at them... trying hard at things, it's not even the olympics huhuhuhuh OMG they're playing netball huhuhuh

Diamagnetic materials have a very small, but non-zero response to magnetic field - they very slightly repel magnetic fields.  For something like pyrolytic carbon (which has a stronger than usual diamagnetic response, and is very low density) you can get it to float on a strong rare earth magnet.

Therefore, I'm afraid, that _every_ material has a response to magnetic fields - even if it's so small you need high precision precision machinery to show it in some material.

The terms used in this item are unclear if they mean 'magnetic' in the colloquial sense (which maps to 'does steel stick to it', hence ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic), rather than the more technical sense.  So I suspect that they would be able to argue that the use of the term was 'correct' in some sense.

The supermarkets are so efficient that they are eliminating competition at a local level.

This is one of the challenges of capitalism, it's strive for efficacy rewards scale.  Size allows better prices from suppliers, and enables them to undercut the competition.

The extra tax is a good tool to introduce a little inefficiency.  If this money is sensibly reinvested into free parking in town centres, or providing better local shopping centres it will help balance the domination of the big 4 supermarkets.

Supermarkets cheap food comes at a price, their workers are less well paid, they don't need local accountants, or delivery companies.  They are less likely to source local foods, and tend to focus on a few big brands.

If it means that we pay a fraction more for our food. While making us think about using more local services, then we will all be a little better off.

Before you ask 'how is it not voluntary?', some people believe economic pressures force homeowners to have to put themselves in debt in order to be able to get a family suitable home.

&gt;They're not comparable because one has a basis in a framework which we (apparently) agree is generally good, and the other has a basis in 'gay people are yucky'. You don't need to get into whether housing is a human right to see the difference. 

You're just reading into it way too far, I said 'legalistic' for a specific reason because he was defending an eviction purely on the basis of ""court orders which have been given all proper legal scrutiny but which have judged the bank to be entitled to the assets which they are claiming."" which some people find to just be a ridiculous defence of the status quo, again, they don't agree with the concept of it being a voluntary contract because of reasons outlined above.",0,1406372830,null,0,false,0,cj89hhc,t3_2bodc5,t1_cj89hhc,t1_cj7w5pd,null,1434907659,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,phys1cs,null,null,"On the last point, the credit card is absolutely worth it. You get 3% cashback on petrol, plus the first year's fees are waived if you've got the 123 current account so that's ~£39 a year for doing basically nothing. Even after the first year, you'll be quids in just on petrol, and the supermarket cashback will add up once you move out (and it's useful to have a credit card anyway, as long as you always pay the monthly bill in full).

As for what to do with the money - that depends on what your plans are. If you want to buy a house within a couple of years, you're probably best keeping it in cash. You can open a second 123 account, for a start. The current interest payment is 20,000 * 3% * 1/12 = £50 pre-tax. Take away 20% tax and a £2 fee gives you £38, plus presumably £0.93 for cashback (direct debit on phone bill or something). You could earn interest on the extra £7400 too if you opened another account - they should be fine with that as long as you say it's to organise your finances or something rather than just to make more money... Remember to transfer the minimum amount in each month and set up direct debits etc though.

If you're willing to take a longer term view, you can contribute up to £40k a year to a pension and the annual capital gains tax allowance is about £11k, so there's still plenty of room for tax-efficient investing in equities and bonds. A pension is always a good idea, ideally through your employer's scheme. As for general investments in non-cash assets, it's something you'll need to do long term if you want to beat inflation, but if you were planning on putting a lot of money into a deposit or similar in the near future then you might want to stay away from equities for the moment as the value of your investment can drop very quickly.

Also note that £1100 a month probably won't leave much to spare once you're living away from home. Probably not enough to be comfortable living on your own in many areas, so if you're going to be living in cheap shared accommodation for some time it might make sense to invest for the slightly longer term. With that amount of cash, it would be very easy to live beyond your means for quite some time though.

I would also say that some of these things should be considered local problems. Obviously, slavery is bad, unsafe working practices are bad, pollution is bad etc. - but unless there is a credible local effort to prevent them, anything else will just be a token effort. Supermarkets don't aim to have dodgy suppliers in their supply chain, they just have a lot of suppliers, some of which are in bits of the world that don't look after workers well.

A business of any size can be ethical or unethical. In fact, a small company is going to have less control over their supply chain (unless it is very short and local, but this probably only applies to a minority of businesses). It's just that big business scandal is high profile enough to dig into.

Don't get me wrong, I believe small and decentralised is better, I just believe the world is complicated. Better to treat the cause.

However, the problem arises that many people complain that they are not given a choice - either by management expectation, or even explicit threat of sanction (loss of job, missing out on promotions etc), and are thus expected to work for no compensation for part of their time at work.

Whilst it is true that a yearly salary for given hours (rather than an hourly wage), does have some flexibility, in that your boss might sometimes expect you to finish a task instead of leaving on the dot of five, if there is no 'give' with the take, and you are never allowed home early on a quiet day, then you're simply doing more hours than are on your contract, and still only getting the same pay.

Basically, a job requires a certain amount of time, both scheduled and predictable, and a certain amount of extra contingency time, (which can often also be approximately predicted), and should be taken into account by employers - not just ignored, on the assumption that the worker will take up the slack - the employee's work life balance depends on knowing the hours they are paid to be at work, and when they are free to be on their own time.",0,1406375753,null,0,false,0,cj89zl6,t3_2boina,t1_cj89zl6,t1_cj7fa4x,null,1434907806,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This is because most people feel that they don't have a choice. It doesn't matter if there is another party that better matches your opinions. If you are on the political left, you basically have to vote Labour just to try and stop the conservatives winning and vice versa.

If you felt that say, the Green party more closely matched your ideals, you can't vote for them because that just means one less vote for Labour and thus the conservatives are more likely to win.

true,Aphexs,null,null,"Hey, I work for an energy company (not one of the big six) so I can give you some info.

- If you share a gas bill with another flat, there's most likely only one gas meter serving both flats. This would be the case if the property was just one single house before it was separated. Leading from this, ask your landlord about the meters. Ask them where they are, and also ask them about the gas bill situation. The property may have 1 gas meter and 2 elec meters, or 1 gas and 1 elec.

To be honest you should have separate meters for each property so the landlord may be trying to get away with classing the property as only one residence, which would make it harder to get the bills sorted.

Again, ask the landlord about the meter situation and about gas and electricity for the property, whether the flats are separate of if they treat the whole building as one. Before you sort out bills, you'll need to know exactly what the situation is.

- Gas and electricity are always on. The energy is only turned off when say a house is vacant for a long period of time and the owner has requested it, or if someone hasnt paid their bills in a VERY long time (talking about years).

The electricity and gas will already be on, and you and your flatmates will be responsible for it from the date your tenancy starts. I would advise you to find the meters, **take clear pictures of them, including the readings on the front, and save them** as this will back you up if there's any dispute with the bills, and also proves what the readings were when you moved in. The landlord or letting agent should know what company is supplying the electricity and gas already, so get the details off them, then phone up the companies and inform them that you're living there. They'll ask for your details, the date your tenancy started, and also the meter readings. Give them your name and the names of everyone living there. Then get your flatmates to contact the energy companies themselves to inform them they wish to be equally financially liable. This will avoid anyone fucking off down the line and getting away with not having to pay any bills. Trust me, this helps.

Tell them that you don't want to fix in to a contract yet, and that you'll shop around. Go on some comparison websites and find the best deal for you. If you've found a good deal with another company, sign up with them. The switching process takes around 6 weeks, so once its happened you'll receive one final bill from the companies that you initially contacted.

- Not sure about water, I'd ask the landlord or letting agents about that.

One final thing, once you've (hopefully) got it all sorted out, GIVE METER READINGS ONCE A MONTH. You have no idea how much grief and problems occur because people don't give readings, then they blame their energy company when they receive a huge bill. Just submit the readings once a month, and you'll always know exactly what you're using.

true,fogard14,null,null,"&gt;It's just lazy. What it feels like to me is an imposition of someone else's sport onto ours. This isn't NFL or NBA. This is football.

How are the terms like outsideback or PK relevant to the NFL or NBA at all?  They are different terms that have nothing to do with any other sport.

&gt;For Americans, yes this is a new and shiny sport, but don't forget that tactics, analysis and terminology has adapted and evolved over a hundred years.

For me, as an individual, it's a sport I've been playing my whole life.  Not a shiny new thing.  I'm not talking about tactics or analysis.  Yes the terminology has adapted and evolved over a hundered years and its going to continue to, hence the reason some of these terms are created.

&gt;The advantage the Americans have in this sport is that they aren't weighed down by their history. Watching the USA play is refreshing because whilst the quality of play and tactical awareness is quite poor, they are positive and run around a lot. There were a bunch of teams like this in this WC - Costa Rica are a good example but so too are Algeria and Iran. It is great to watch.

I agree with all of this.


&gt;And please, what you're saying about you being a better footballer than an average English fan is ridiculous. I bet I've got a bigger knob than you. Don't let this get so personal. But lets be clear on this: in terms of professional football, there is a gulf as wide as the ocean when it comes to talent between England and America.

This is my point I was trying to get to when I talked about my ability to play/coach.  I hate getting looked down on as an American by people from other countries like England or Mexico just because it's more popular in their country.  Steven Gerrard or Peter Withe can look down on me because they are much better and understand the sport much better than I ever will.  However I hate it when your average English person hides behind them and says ""well professional football in England is better so I know more"".  No you don't.  You don't live the sport like I do.



Here's my main point.  You can make fun of journalists and ""plastic"" fans for using the incorrect terms all day long.  I agree with you and do the same thing.  However there are plenty of American soccer terms that are strictly soccer and have nothing to do with knowledge or love of the sport.  I use a mix between American terms and British terms because I know both and I use what I like.  If I use all of the exact terms as British terms than I lose part of my culture as an American.

Despite this, the last 3 times I've been there, when mid-20's people hear I'm British, they immediately want to talk about John Oliver. I never really understood the different between Jon Stewart's show and John Oliver's show until it was pointed out to me that isn't merely ""poking fun"" at the republicans, he's actively trying to provoke thought and sometimes change with the subjects he covers.

Take the bit about net neutrality, for example. Stewart would have made a load of sarcastic remarks about the situation, and left it at that. Oliver actively is trying to invoke change and what he considers is the ""right thing"" and I think that's what a lot of the younger generation in America want, they want someone not only to point out the absurdity of the situation, but someone to actively campaign about it.

The most interesting segment was the bit about GM. To us in the UK, it seemed pretty obvious that they should be held to task, but the people I talked about with it said GM was pretty much infallible due to their history of being an American car maker. The segment on GM was a wake up call to a lot of people it seems about the potential evils of big business and the private sector, and while it didn't get as much publicity as the net neutrality bit, it definitely made some voters take notice.

For starters, most West Ham fans have berated Sam Allardyce for getting us promoted and keeping us in the Premier League. While I am not at all fond of Kevin Nolan, he was our leading goal scorer and led the assists last season, so having him in the starting line up would seem logical.

Pre-season is all about game time and getting back into the swing of things, results don't really matter. It isn't promising that reports I have read on the games say the same thing ""Passed it about well, but then hit it long when they ran out of ideas.""

The problem, As Kumb has said, seems to be in the boardroom. It seems like it's just Sullivan, but I might be wrong, but he has done his best to undermine the manager at every step. It was fairly obvious that Zarate was a Boardroom signing, baring in mind he was at Birmingham under their reign, but to spout off to the papers about that and Ravel Morrison is just embarrassing.

Even worse, some of them seem to have come away infected by the hatred they tried to put an end to.

So what's in it for me? Why should I care about it so much, when on a geopolitical level it's not as threatening to me or to this country as Russia taking over Ukraine, or the central middle east turning into a state straight out of the 8th century, complete with beheadings, public whippings and crucifixions?

I paid a flat rate of just under £45/month for bills (so ~£11/week), for 12 months, and then got £150 back at the end because we didn't use that much. That was in a house of 6. It wasn't much different to what friends in similar sized houses were paying, maybe like £30 more over the year each.

All individual occupants pay Glide directly, rather than it being fed through one person. Seriously, it was so nice because we didn't trust a couple of people we were moving in with. Turned out to be a good decision because the internet was done separately, and they never paid on time or had the money (hello smoking habits). Glide do offer internet with it as well I think, we just decided to go separately.

Could be worth a thought, unless you really know and trust them all to pay on time.

Can you go back and get advice from the charity? Or any other welfare advice place, CAB etc. they might have some ideas on how to put pressure on having a decision made (and will also help if her claim is not successful).

If your mum's struggling with work, am I right in assuming that's because of her illnesses? If so, you may want to find out more about ESA. That's paid at a lower assessment phase rate even while she's claiming but has not yet had a work capability assessment. Although the fact that she's working right now might complicate things if she claims soon as there are certain rules on when someone can start a claim. Again, any welfare expert will be able to help you. Or there are heaps of advice on the internet if you know where to look to get a basic understanding of ESA/PIP.

Where did he do that? He stated ""Britain (or rather all the countries of the empire)"". Maybe incorrect terminology, Canada hadn't been part of the 'empire' for nine years but I don't see him saying what you are accusing him of.

Canada was a member of the British Commonwealth (the 'British' part hadn't been dropped yet) and most Canadians would have considered themselves British to some degree. In the same way that now someone might be Scottish first and British second or English first and British second people in Oz/Canada/NZ (amongst others) largely identified themselves in the same way until a good bit into the post war era.

&gt; Also, our American friends would probably take offense to your statement. They weren't in the war, but their merchant fleet was running back and forth across the Atlantic at risk to support the UK. To dismiss their support also is callous of you. Such a short memory you have. :(

You should look into some of the diplomacy between Churchill &amp; Roosevelt both before and after America's entry into the war. It paints a much grimmer picture than the view that is held in popular belief. We paid for every scrap of metal that was shipped across that ocean. In fact we were still paying off the interest up until 2006. The fact that tagged along to the conditions of lend lease was the dismantling of the British Empire to make way for American economic hegemony puts it well below the realms of 'support' as you put it and more into the realm of Realpolitiks.

true,raceAround126,null,null,"**Background**: I've worked for a DCA (less proud moments). I also worked for four years developing financial software primarily with regards to credit and financial products. I'm not an IFA, nor am I financially ""qualified"", but from my experience dealing with IFAs, Compliance officers and the like. I've seen more than a few credit reports.

**'You have no successfully settled credit account'**

This is a bit of a red herring and can appear for a variety of reasons. Have you ever missed any payments? Do you have any agreements to pay on your record (denoted AP)? Were you ever delinquent with any of your accounts? This may be a strong possibility as to why it's there. But without seeing the report itself, I can't tell you exactly (I'm not asking to by the way!)

**'The age of your accounts indicates lenders are likely to view you as higher risk'**

Yes, absolutely! Your last credit card was opened in 2014 and the one before only a few months. In fact, you have been applying for a lot recently! That could be a red flag dependent on your lender's criteria.

**Aqua and Vanquis**
Close them! They are not good things to have on your credit report and I have seen some lenders refuse credit solely based on histories with sub-prime lenders.

**Unused credit cards**
Same story. There are multiple reasons. Firstly too many credit cards, with or without balances, could indicate that you are struggling financially. Similarly, the unused balance could be seen that you are not making use of existing lines of credit. 

**Current accounts**

You only need one. Keep the one which offers you the best rate of interest on your balance. I doubt it will be much. NEVER use your overdraft for anything!

**Closing credit cards**

It will initially hurt your rating when you close accounts. Recent closures are seen as negative activity, but this becomes irrelevant fairly quickly, approx 6 months or so.

**The nitty gritty**

What is your aim here? Are you intending on applying for a mortgage at some point, or are you seeking a loan?

**CreditExpert**

Cancel your membership today! It can get expensive with the direct debit. All you need is the £2 statutory report from both the lenders, Experian and Equifax! You don't need to sign up for anything and believe me, their scores are utterly meaningless!

**Defaults and CCJs**

You don't mention it, but if you have any, are your defaults marked as settled? If so, what date were they settled? You need to wait six years before these drop off your record. Any CCJs? Were these settled within 30 days of judgement? If so, you will be able to have them removed.

Highly doubt Reina will still be at the club, but there's no doubt in my mind that he's a better all round keeper than Mignolet and much more capable in terms of commanding his box/organising his centre backs. 

Not convinced Flanagan will be used at LB much this season, and though he was decent last year, I still think he was vulnerable a lot and often targeted by the opposition. Enrique for me is better all round. 

Lallana is obviously out for the first few matches, but regardless of that I would play Coutinho. Proved last year that he steps up in the big games and this year I can see him stepping up again and improving that goal return.

Didn't I just demonstrate in my last post that the economy can grow without increased pollution?

&gt;It has everything to do with thermodynamics, since waste co2 represents an increase in entropy.

In thermodynamics, the entropy of an isolated system will always either increase or remain stationary. Good thing the Earth isn't an isolated system them. We constantly receive energy from the sun that we can use to decrease entropy on Earth. That's what photosynthesis and photovoltaics can do, and it's why other life forms didn't cause the planet to be uninhabitable within the first few thousand years of existence.

If you are trying to use physics words to sound clever, just stop. It's not working.

&gt;And there is nothing more to GDP than the ability to do work energy and resources are the fundamental requirement of a functioning economy. You can magic up a billion quid in derivatives but it has no intrinsic value.

GDP is short for Gross domestic product, not gross domestic energy use. Services such as healthcare, retail and banking have clearly defined value but do not consume significantly more resources than a world without them would. Products such as intellectual property, movies, vidya games, music, research, books. Those all have clearly defined value yet can take up effectively 0 resources to produce.

The only thing that matters is that you filled out a P46. Your national insurance number will be on there. The HMRC will match it up to your previous role and that will be that. It really doesn't matter which checkbox you ticked. Technically, if you were let go from your previous job and only just started this one, it *is* your first job since the new tax year. 

You may find your first paycheck will be emergency taxed but after a month or so, it will sort itself out. And really, HMRC deals with this every day. They're not going to call up your employer with personal details of previous employment, that's not what they're there to do.

Could your employer find out? Well, I'm assuming that you've only started recently which means you are still in probation. Which means they will want successful references. Have you already provided references? If your story is that this is your first job, then they will usually take personal references from people who know you. You sound quite young, therefore probably not loads of work history, so usually employers are lenient. If there's no references to get, then there it is!

Your probation period is there to gauge your efficacy at performing the role. If after three months everyone's happy and all the paperwork is present, then all good. If you goof off, or ""misconduct"" again, then, well... silly you!

But no. There's no way to tell from HMRC documentation that you have a previous role. You could probably take an educated guess, but that's not proof and if they've hired you, I doubt that they're out to hang you straight away!

For what it's worth, despite the other reactions here, I don't blame you for covering it up. Anyone who's walked in with a previous history of getting sacked for misconduct (they've had to admit it) is an instant rejection. Not necessarily my rules, but more HR themselves.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"As I said, Western interference has been much less than Russian interference. The people in Ukraine (or at least the people in the west of Ukraine) wanted to create closer ties with the EU. You can't blame the EU for the people in Ukraine seeing ties with them as better than ties with Russia. To combat this, Russia sent subsidies to Yanukovych to sweeten him up, taking a much more direct role in Ukrainian politics. This sparked the riots in Kiev, and his ousting, not because the EU and the West incited them, but because Yanukovych went back on his word and went against the will of his people to side with a country who's actions many disagreed with.

When conflict broke out in Crimea and the east, again, Russia took a much more direct and imperialistic role than the EU and the West. Russia sent soldiers into Crimea, helping pressure the region into voting to join Russia, and supported rebels in the east of the country. Again, the EU is only guilty of existing, and you can't blame the EU for Russian imperialism. 

This situation is nothing like Yugoslavia. The conflict in Yugoslavia stemmed from a rapid growth in nationalism which had been suppressed under Tito, and was due to powers within Yugoslavia (namely nationalist parties in Serbia and Croatia coming into conflict, and the vote from Slovenia to leave). The conflict in Ukraine can be directly attributed to Russia, both pressuring Yanukovych to not create closer ties with the EU, and more directly sending soldiers into Crimea and arming rebels in the east. 

Imagine the outrage if the EU, or countries in the EU, sent soldiers into Ukraine. Anti-EU people in this country would be crying imperialism and reduction of sovereignty, yet they seem willing to ignore Russia doing to exact same thing to push their anti-EU agenda.

He's got all the physical tools to be great and just needs to refine that mental game of his, but at the same time, there's a laundry list of young, pacey wingers that looked dangerous but weren't productive that ended up not really attaining the expected high level.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; People blame the EU for the crisis, as the EU offered Ukraine the option to join (or create closer ties with the EU), and that made Russia act.

They blame the EU and US, amongst other things, for helping to foment the original coup d'etat which ousted the elected president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, not by any stretch a popular revolution, and replacing him with a Western-leaning partly fascist-led junta.  Some allege an involvement in the Maidan sniper killing also (and there are certainly some serious anomalies which make this highly unlikely to have been the work of the previous government).

The leaked conversation between Victoria Nuland, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the US ambassador to Ukraine demonstrates the extent of US collusion in installing a hard-right puppet regime in Kiev and details some of how EU members stoked protests there to secure regime change.

[The CIA themselves admit providing $4 billion of funding for the Maidan protests because Yanukovych wouldn't sign an ""association agreement"" with the EU](http://theother14.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/leaked-cia-report-ukraine-current-issues-and-u-s-policy/) which included implementing a severe austerity package and provisions for the dumping of EU goods in Ukraine.  In order it get those sort of measures in place they needed a full-on client state, and they didn't much care if it was  racist, anti-Semitic, hardcore neo-fascist one which had to be imposed on the 80% of Russian-speakers in the country.

Not to mention the EU/US both have form on this, not just the kind of general form of which they have plenty, but specific form in the Ukraine - when they funded the Orange Revolution to bring to power a pro-Western government in Ukraine; but on that occasion too, it was not stable, and disintegrated pretty rapidly.",0,1406384851,null,0,1406385622,0,cj8c788,t3_2brn1r,t1_cj8c788,t1_cj89xw9,null,1434908905,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Just a side note - reading the wikipedia page of Stephen Byers and this article side by side is  illuminating:

*In his diary, Alastair Campbell recalls the ferocious monstering that was given to the then transport secretary, Stephen Byers, in the spring of 2002, which continued even after he had resigned: “It’s like they get a corpse but then are disappointed there is nothing left to try and kill, so they kill the dead body too.”*

- Hack attack

*Byers' troubles continued over the following months. The Labour-dominated House of Commons Transport Select Committee criticised the party's transport strategy, and a long-running row over Byers' decision as Trade Secretary to allow pornographic-magazine publisher Richard Desmond to buy the Daily Express newspaper returned to the limelight. The pressure on Byers was too much, and he resigned on 28 May 2002 to be replaced by Alastair Darling. The BBC announced the change with the comment ""It's bye-bye Byers, hello Darling"".*

Markovic was praised heavily before coming here so I see only positives, a true, unadulterated talent. 
 
Lambert is a romantic, yet pragmatic, move for very little money and is a great role player in the offense.

Lallana is another good move but I do feel that the price tag may hinder him for a little while.

Can looks to be an absolute steal.  I could see him becoming a starter quicker than any other player brought in this window.  

Origi I'm not sold on, while yes he has talent he is very raw and will probably need a year or two on loan before he can be properly fused with the starting XI

Remy for the price paid for him it is a good move, I just hope he doesn't upset any chemistry.  But I'd see him starting on the left as the season progresses.  

Lovren I feel is unnecessary with all the CB's we currently have.  I admit the 'leadership' role is needed but I have my reservations.  

Obviously LB needs to be attended to and soon.  Moreno or Bertrand seems to be the decision now 18 mil to 9 mil.  Hopefully whoever is chosen works out because this position is becoming irritating.

 Well yeah, I know that... That is why I am saying why didn't we go for someone cheaper, less ovepriced? It's not like we were forced to buy Lallana.

&gt;  He is a player that really badly wanted to come, he will give it 100% to play the best he can for the shirt.

 Ok, but most of the people who want to go to the club would give 100%. I mean, they are professionals paid to play football, why wouldn't someone give 100%.

&gt;  Being English also means his communication with the team (mostly English) will be very good.

 I guess it's a small, small perk. A lot of international players have decent english skills, like Shaqiri does! Also, it's not like they are discussing rocket science, so they have to have wide vocabulary :)

&gt;  He is proven in the EPL and was playing for a team that had the same tactics, style of play that Liverpool had. So adapt-ion wouldn't take long.

 If someone is a world-class player, he will easily adapt himself in EPL just like Coutinho did, and how many other international players adapt themselves in EPL.

Lallana - Great signing and about right price. He was in the PL team of the season remember.

Lambert - Short term signing which will really help us in the next two or three seasons in terms of adding depth and an experienced head. Great signing.

Markovic - Real prospect got for a bargain price owing to the release clause and third party ownership.

Can - Good talent which could evolve into a world class talent. Versatile in playing position which makes him perfect for our midfield. Exploited release clause to get him for under half his true worth if not more.

Remy - If he can stay fit then he'll be a 20 goal a season striker. For £8.5m that is a great price. 

Origi - Pipped to be Belgium's next great striker with some saying he has the potential to better Lukaku and Benteke. High price for such a young striker but it could really pay off.

Lovren - Authoritative voice at the back. High price but you pay what you must to get what you need. We need Lovren.


We don't NEED a £30m signing but what we do need is two fullbacks. We are getting Manquillo it seems like so we just need a left-back. If we need to spend £30m to get the right LB then so be it. In the end it isn't how much you pay for a player, it is if the player is a right player.


People get so hung up on transfer fees it is hilarious. I still see Ilori quoted as a £7m signing even though that is simply not true (as confirmed by Rodgers early on last season).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;How are the terms like outsideback or PK relevant to the NFL or NBA at all? They are different terms that have nothing to do with any other sport.

I have no idea. If they aren't derivatives from another US sport, then I have no idea. Maybe this explains why American players often face a lot of problems with positional play in Europe.

&gt;For me, as an individual, it's a sport I've been playing my whole life. Not a shiny new thing. I'm not talking about tactics or analysis. Yes the terminology has adapted and evolved over a hundered years and its going to continue to, hence the reason some of these terms are created.

You tell me. What is an outside back that a full back or wing back isn't? Sounds like a word replacement for the want of ease of understanding in a specific market.

&gt;This is my point I was trying to get to when I talked about my ability to play/coach. I hate getting looked down on as an American by people from other countries like England or Mexico just because it's more popular in their country. Steven Gerrard or Peter Withe can look down on me because they are much better and understand the sport much better than I ever will. However I hate it when your average English person hides behind them and says ""well professional football in England is better so I know more"". No you don't. You don't live the sport like I do.

It sounds like you have a really big chip on your shoulder about this. ""You don't live the sport like I do"" - really? Again, this just sounds insecure. One thing I will say is that there's really no substitute for watching quality games live. Most tactical analysis is only really possible if you're able to see the full pitch. I moved to HK a few years ago and that's the thing I really struggle with - not being able to see quality players off the ball. If you're in America and perhaps only watching the MLS live, then you're missing out. Mind you given that England has 50 million football fans and a finite amount of stadia, your average football fan in the UK probably isn't going to too many games either. They, however, have this means. Either way, it's stupid to make comparisons on how important the sport is to each other. It's immature.

&gt;You can make fun of journalists and ""plastic"" fans for using the incorrect terms all day long. I agree with you and do the same thing. However there are plenty of American soccer terms that are strictly soccer and have nothing to do with knowledge or love of the sport. I use a mix between American terms and British terms because I know both and I use what I like. If I use all of the exact terms as British terms than I lose part of my culture as an American. We don't all have to do things exactly like the Brits do.

I understand your point. Like I said the last time, I disagree with it. I don't see any advantage in bastardising the sport's nomenclature for the sake of appeasing one nation of fans. There doesn't seem to be any tactical innovation for the terms used. They seem to have just been replaced with no respect for the culture or tradition of the current nomenclature. And, speaking as a foreigner looking at America, this type of behaviour is often type-cast to your typical American.",0,1406390276,null,0,false,0,cj8e2zq,t3_2boihu,t1_cj8e2zq,t1_cj8aet7,null,1434909726,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

Yes I have two defaults unfortunately, both with telecommunications companies from 2012. 

One I'm just putting together all my documentation to send to the Communications Ombudsman, as it's an ongoing dispute that I'm hoping the ombudsman will rule in my favour. It's not a huge amount (£650) so I'll happily pay it if the ombudsman doesn't find in my favour. 

The second is another dispute, but as it's a relatively small figure (£250) I've asked the relevant debt collection company if they would remove the default from my file in exchange for full, immediate payment. They said yes, so I'm in the middle of sorting this one. I didn't think this was possible, but apparently it is. 

Ultimately I'd like to take out finance on a new vehicle, and save for a mortgage deposit. I'd like to save a good 15-20% deposit before looking for a mortgage, but that's a few years away yet. 

My salary is quite good (55k) and u have quite a bit of disposable income each month, so it's really frustrating having a low credit score because of my poor experiences with the two telecoms companies.

Great Britain. I know London's the centre of the universe and all, but some London area statistics would be more useful.

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_227904.pdf suggests that people who work in London spend a fair bit of money and time getting to work. Presumably most of the people who spend more and take longer to get to work, aren't doing it from Central London. 

&gt; It's pretty rubbish that national and local governments don't build affordable housing as this would keep prices down and stop the need for giving so much money in housing benefit to private landlords.

Agreed for outside of London, but how do you think this is going to happen in a city where the land alone is going to be insanely expensive? Expect the taxpayer to pay for that so that the few can live in ""cheap"" flats in Zone 1?

And then once he's lost the ball he's completely out of position to help against the counter-attack because he's committed forward.

When he was a good attacking fullback then you could forgive his defensive issues and he was still a good player overall, but at least for the last six months he seemed more a liability than anything else.

In regards to the Nuland-Pyatt call, I still think there is a clear difference between contacting the (at the time) opposition in Ukraine and offering advice, which is what the US and probably EU officials did, and threatening severe economic sanctions, trying to essentially bribe the leader of Ukraine, and when that didn't work invaded the state and funding rebels in it, which is what Russia did. Of course both sides have interests in Ukraine, it's the way Russia have gone about it which is the issue.

This also covers their friends, relatives, and anyone else visiting the property. If they are in breach of this agreement then they will be liable to enforcement action and possibly eviction.

Since your neighbours have young kids they might not be able to prevent them throwing the odd thing over the fence, but it's reasonable to expect them to make some effort. And constant loud music is unreasonable if it goes above and beyond ""everyday noise"". 

Given that your neighbours are foreign, personally I'd have a go at politely explaining the situation to them, unless they seem batshit. They might not realise that they are causing you grief, and/or they might not appreciate that this could lead to serious consequences. 

If that doesn't get anywhere, or if it causes them to kick off, google anti-social tenant &lt;your local authority name&gt;. There should be a number to call.

People who spend longer to travel are probably travelling a longer distance - it's fairly simple stuff.

&gt; This seems to suggest that around 5% of London journeys are over 50 miles. So not millions.

I prefer to use proper sourced stuff instead of some person's blogspam. http://legacy.london.gov.uk/gla/publications/factsandfigures/dmag-briefing-2007-03.pdf is bit old, but it suggests:

&gt; Workers in London who commute by train trave
lled the longest distance on average (32km),
though the average for Inner London (33km) was
far greater than Outer
(20km). 

Obviously not ""50 miles"", but I think you seem fixated on that exact number. The point is that people are commuting large distances, made longer by slow commuter rail, and still extremely expensive (season tickets will be thousands per year even for somewhere like Reading to London, which can get you into Westminster in 25 minutes). Undoubtedly when HS2 happens, Birmingham will be a dormitory town for London.

&gt; By higher density. By using some of the 59,000+ empty homes in London.

You need land to build higher density places. Experiments in tower blocks in the 60s haven't exactly helped the idea of putting loads of council house tenants in massive blocks. As for empty homes, why do you think the government has the right to do that?

&gt; By taxing the second homes and private rentals that are pushing house prices up. Etc.

Agreed. But I don't think it is quite as easy as that.

If you have an Android phone or an iPhone, consider spending three quid on the Real Time Trains [app](http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/apps). It's basically the same information on the station departure boards but having it on your phone means you can refer to it during your journey.

The National Rail Enquiries site has information pages for most stations, including [Chester](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/CTR.aspx), [Crewe](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/CRE.aspx), [London Euston](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/eus.aspx), [London Liverpool Street](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/lst/details.html) and [Ipswich](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/IPS.aspx). They also have handy maps of the station showing the layout of all the platforms.

Finally, regarding the Tube, be aware that there is major [engineering work](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/june/major-refurbishment-for-euston-escalators) happening at the moment to replace the escalators at Euston Tube station. /u/vln's advice about using Euston Square Tube station instead is definitely a better idea.",0,1406394224,null,0,false,0,cj8fq2s,t3_2brt0l,t1_cj8fq2s,t3_2brt0l,null,1434910507,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; At the time there was no civil war. No republic had seceded. The U.S. was not engaged in a public dispute with Yugoslavia. The region was not even in the news. World attention was focused on the international coalition the Bush administration was assembling to destroy Iraq—a war that reshaped the Middle East at a cost of half a million Iraqi lives.

That law was passed at the end of 1990, coming into effect in 1991. By that time: Milosevic had already inflamed tensions between Serbs and Kosovans in Kosovo; Serbian nationalist thugs had already pressured Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro into appointing pro-Milosevic governments; a Serbian dominated federal council (4 of 8 chairs had pro-Serbian/pro-Milosevic governments) effectively disarmed Croatia and Slovenia, further inflaming tensions in the government of Yugoslavia; democratic elections in states result in almost all of them electing nationalist governments, the Croatian government especially offended Serbians, as the banner they used was the same banner used by Croatian fascists in the Second World War, who killed many ethnic Serbs; Slovenia voted overwhelmingly for independence; ethnic-Serbs began to rebel in Croatia. 

If that doesn't look like the rapid deterioration into civil war, I don't know what does. 

I also dispute the impartiality of that website, which has a tag line of 'information, activism &amp; resistance to U.S. militarism, war &amp; corporate greed, linking with struggles against racism and oppression within the United States', not that we shouldn't criticise US imperialism, just I would rather have more impartial websites. Another article on that website suggests that the [Ukrainian military may be directly responsible for the MH17 crash](http://www.iacenter.org/ukraine/ukraine072214-2/), another is [defending North Korea](http://www.iacenter.org/korea/korea020213/), another is [defending the actions of Russia in the East, and legitimising the referendums](http://www.iacenter.org/ukraine/ukraine051414//). That website is has an obvious anti-American bias, to the point where it is supporting actions from Russia it would condemn if they were from America.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"For the price of Suarez, Assaidi, one of the defenders that will leave and the loan fees we have managed to strengthen the team in every position except the striker who we downgraded. 


If we had no CL/EL and bought Lallana and Remy for Suarez we would still have top 4 team (not squad obviously). We had problem with over reliance on Coutinho for chances from midfield and also over reliance on Hendersons high intensity pressure. Both would be solved by Lallana. Suarez movement between the lines will IMO be solved by Sterlings improvement after playing no10. Remy would compliment Sturridge as the team counters and both of them are able to pass forward to the other one ala Suarez diagonal pass to Sturridge vs Sunderland and Sturridge cutting in and passing for Suarez on the far post.


One of the problems we had (rarely) was when teams sat back towards the end of the season, neither Suarez nor Sturridge were able to solve it due to the problem needing creative mids to solve. Some of the goals came from Sturridge and Coutinho outside of the box shots, others from Sturridge and Suarez dribbling and passing in the box, some from penalties etc. Point being there was no systematic way of breaking them down, and I was worried this would become the norm if we fixed our defense and attacked the same way. So in this hypothetical situation of Lallana and Remy in for Suarez we would still have shity defense and our style would work for the most part.


With Remy, Lallana, Lovren, Lambert and a decent FB we will sort out our defense and see more clubs sitting back. But unlike last season (Suarez only drops back occasionally when we are pressing high) we will have Lambert and Remy being able to be subbed in if we are goalless and the other team is sitting deep. They will take their chances in the box and will also provide option for crosses in the box. Lallana and Coutinho midfield should be more creative than Hendo/Allen when we are drawing and in need of goal, this was not optional last season when Coutinho would tire towards the end. Then there is still the creativity of Sterling and Markovic, both who should be able to provide chances for whatever combination of strikers we have. 


The team is IMO completely different in terms of potential, with Suarez our highs are very high, but we could not use the team from last season consistently over a long period, it just required injured Coutinho or Hendo or Gerrard (still have this problem but a midfield 2 of Can/Hendo should solve some of it), we did fine without Suarez or Sturridge, but it's the players who don't have replacements or allow for flexibility that could kill us towards second half of the season (Arse/Spurs syndrome). Luckily Hendo was able to play for the first 30+ match days and Gerrard didn't get suspended after he got DM role. But we can't rely on luck and this new team will sort of most of those problems.


Playing in CL I would take the team we will assemble by the end of the window over the team we had last year, we had a decent record against top 4 but in knockout rounds you need variety and with Suarez you get one brilliant match of 2-3 goal involvements and one average match, Sturridge isn't one to score 2-3 goals often and he distributes his involvements very evenly which is why we will do well if that translates to CL. We will also meet clubs that will keep the ball and against Arsenal first half we saw what happens when teams press us in our box, Suarez showed he has brilliant positional awareness but speed is speed and he isn't as great at counter-attacks unless the opposition defenders are tired or unfocused. Sterling, Markovic, Remy and Sturridge will be a huge threat for teams that can keep us in our box and play high line and even if 3 start we have 1 off the bench when the other team tires. Couple of seasons ago Barca were saying how Walcott was the most dangerous Arsenal player and it was only due to his pace, last season Guardiola said something about how he is worried most about Valencia when everyone knows he is shit at finishing. Teams that will dominate us with possession will get beaten on the counter, teams that sit back will get flooded in the box by strikers who can finish and we will have enough options to replace out of form players instead of persisting with them.


Real has Modric, Bayern bought Thiago and moved Lahm to midfield, one of my hopes is that BR doesn't abandon possession football totally and finds a place in the team for Allen. Possession football works great against certain opposition and has huge returns in terms of preserving the players fitness levels and high % wins against smaller clubs who haven't trained to oppose it. As nice as Dortmunds style sounds, it's them that had huge number of injuries last season and not Barca who has through the last 4+ years only had 18 or so players in their squad who contribute through the season despite being involved in every cup there is. I have high hopes for this squad, everywhere there is some exciting player and some young players that might develop into world class (ignoring defense/keeper) with a manager that wants to develop them and is willing to experiment in order to find a place for them.",0,1406395236,null,0,false,0,cj8g5it,t3_2bs2u3,t1_cj8g5it,t3_2bs2u3,null,1434910717,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Russia moved troops into Crimea without permission from the Ukrainian government and without declaring war or otherwise giving notice prior to this action. This action is one of clear hostility towards the sovereignity of Ukraine.

Certain parts of international law are considered to be customary international law; they apply to all states whether ratified by them or not. One of these is the Hague Convention of 1907 as agreed upon at the Nuremburg Trials.

Section III (Convention Relative to the Opening of Hostilities) Article 1 states “The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war.”

Russia has carried out what is called a ""Crime against peace"".

true,raceAround126,null,null,"Two defaults mean you're not getting credit from anywhere that isn't subprime. But you know that. 

OK, so the first £650 one. Depending on the circumstances, an OFCOM decision is not a cast iron ruling. As in, it's not technically enforceable and if it ever ended up in a courtroom, there's a lot the telecoms company can do to mitigate the original complaint.

Satisfying the default does not clear it from your record. In fact, the default does not drop off your credit file until 6 years after the default is satisfied which, from what you say, it currently is not. 

The good news is, *generally* the companies generally tend to go along with the ombudsman's rulings. I've only ever seen a few cases where it's not happened and it was usually down to either mistakes in the original complaint or investigation or the ruling was challenged for being too extortionate. But given the amounts and the fact you're only asking for a default removal, I shouldn't think you'll have a problem. That is, provided your complaint is upheld!

The second one, are you working with the original lender, or the debt collection company it was sold to? If the latter, then get over to all-about-debt forums. The guys there have more knowledge than anyone and will happily advise you. But, for a quick summary, you will need to have a fully written and signed agreement that cleaning up the credit file is part and parcel of the full and final settlement. Due to the small value, don't get sucked into unenforcibility and attempting statute barred. The full and final settlement is the correct idea, provided you ensure the wording is bullet-proof.

If you can have a third party write a cheque for you to cover the amount, it infinitely reduces the likelihood of the DCA trying to screw you over. Remember, DCAs are not your friend nor are they financial institutions. They are there to soak you for money constantly. So get advice from AAD properly before you finalize anything! AAD usually appreciate a small token of appreciation (a tenner or so) but the advice and guidance is worth ten times that. (I don't run the site or anything, just had good experiences with it!)

As for aspirations, do nothing but save. £55k is an excellent salary, so make sure you have that ISA working for you. The housing market is the ideal investment right now (working on purchasing my second flat)!

Most certainly, do not take out any more credit until all this is sorted and you have a good few £k of savings. And don't screw up your chances of getting a mortgage because you have £10k of vehicle finance on your report. I drive a £500 Fiesta and it's doing me proud! Over 2000 miles in this last month and it's still ready for more!

If you want a mortgage for, say, £200k with a £50k deposit, if you have existing finance outstanding on your report worth, say, £10k, the mortgage lender will simply calculate that as you having £50k - £10k = £40k deposit.

So keep that record clean if a mortgage is in your future!",0,1406396206,null,0,false,0,cj8gkdf,t3_2bazsi,t1_cj8gkdf,t1_cj8e62p,null,1434911000,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Not sure why I'm being downvoted - watch full matches with these players in (not football manager/fifa) and you'll see. Matip, Savic &amp; Perrin are much better than Kaboul &amp; That other shit guy. Many French people feel Perrin should have got in the French Squad over Mangala, and plays for St Etienne. Will we go for players like this? Nope. 

And Balanta will be at a HUGE club, most River fans are surprised he's not in Europe now - Same with Doria. And Sean Morrison is great. Does the club even HAVE a scouting team? It's ridiculous.

 If you consider how Mourinho has set up the defense to have one defensive fullback and the other attacking, it leaves Dave on the bench for now at least. With Luis coming in, Dave is no longer the better attacking fullback, and defensively Iva is more physical and better in the air. As far as marking and reading the game and actually making tackles I would rate Iva and Dave about the same.  

My last opinion is that Iva, although not as skilled on the ball as Dave, is more willing to take risks going forward and making passes. Whereas Dave seems to always want to take a backseat just making easy passes or going backwards for the most part, to let others do the offensive work.

I don't know if studying for a term will be pro-rata but you'd be looking at £3k just for tuition. Their scholarships and bursaries only apply to students who'll do their whole 3+ year course there. So you'd have no money for shelter, food or housing. Obviously different universities have different costs and may have different scholarship/bursary policies so it might be worth deciding where you'd like to go (the north will be cheaper to live in), then contacting the universities directly.

I'd recommend waiting until after term starts in September/October to contact any admissions offices, right now they will be rushed off their feet and not inclined to be helpful. 

I'm not sure what the rules on working are, but companies are unlikely to hire you if you're there for only one term. You might get some cash in hand work tutoring. 

You probably won't get a visa if you can't prove you can cover your living costs. Sleeping in a shelter is not really an option, seeing that we have too few spaces for our homeless people already, they tend not to accommodate people for several months and I doubt it'd count as a permanent address for the visa application anyway.

Harborne High Street has a Waitrose (Expensive, but nice.), a Marks and Spencers (Expensive again.) an Iceland (Dirt cheap, but mostly frozen food.), and a small Sainsbury's (Not really cheap, not that nice, limited selection.). There's also a green grocer's that is good and cheap. It'll be less of a trek for you to go to Harborne High Street and just shop between Iceland and the greengrocer's. Also, during term time there's a fruit and veg market on campus by University Centre that is good and cheap.

Aldi in Selly Oak will be cheaper than any of that, but it is kind of a long walk from Pritchatts. Probably too long to walk if you've got heavy bags to carry home, or frozen food on a hot day. The walk back is uphill, too. There's a really great Korean grocery store in Selly Oak called Seoul Plaza where you can get really cheap staples like rice, soy sauce, etc. There's also a big Sainsbury's in Selly Oak but, despite its size, it's pretty expensive and has a strangely limited selection. Finally, there's Costcutters on the Bristol Road in Selly Oak. I think it's actually called something like University Superstore now, actually, but everyone will call it Costcutters. It's really expensive for Western food, but has a lot of staples from the sub continent for really cheap, like chapatti flour, basmati rice, split peas etc.

Most students don't go into the city centre very often, but in the city centre there's the Bullring Outdoor Market most days, which has dirt cheap veg, and a lot of vegetables such as okra, yams and kerala that are harder to get nearer the uni. The Bullring Indoor market has cheap meat, and is probably the easiest place to get fresh fish if you're living in Pritchatt's. Also nearby is the Day In Supermarket in the Arcadian which has a really wide range of Chinese groceries.

Firstly, I would like to commend you on a well informed, well put together post. You make a lot of points that I agree with.  That being said, I completely disagree with you about us not needing a marquee signing.  

We have made many right moves this transfer window, and I am generally pretty happy with what we have done. I think, however, that if we truly want to cement our place among the very top teams in the world we need to bring in marquee signings whenever it is possible/feasible (meaning that the player is available, plays a position that we need to strengthen, and is willing to entertain offers from us).  That may sound ridiculous at first, but hear me out.  

Marquee signings are about much more than the footballing ability that they bring to the team.  Arguably just as important is the message that bringing in marquee signings sends, not only to our players and fans, but to players and fans of all the teams around Europe and the world.   By signing big names, it shows that we have the ambition to compete at the absolute highest level, and that we as a club are willing to do anything to get to and stay at that level.  If we don't sign big name players at least every few windows, I fear that we will lose many of the players we have spent time developing because they want to play for the ""best"" teams in Europe.  Not only will big names improve our team, but they will help us keep the players that we have developed into big names.  

I love the idea of buying young players that have lots of potential to turn into great players, but buying exclusively those types of players won't get us to where we want to be.  Look at the list of players you typed out above; all of them except Lambert, Lovren, and Lallana are touted as the type of players that have potential to improve our squad, but that won't improve the first team immediately.  We are relying on them to live up to their hype, which is not anywhere close to a guarantee.  Lambert, Lovren, and Lallana, while all good, are also not world class players.  This window might be a little too early to start bringing in truly world class players, but I'm talking about the future as well.  We can't be constantly playing young players to develop them while also competing with the giants of Europe and expect to win.  It's just not feasible in the long run.  

My main point, which I am arriving at after a very long post that kind of goes in circles a bit (I'm sorry, I have been terribly sick the past few days and I am quite out of it) is that **in the modern game**, signing big name players is the only way to stay at the top.  Look at Arsenal, for instance.  For the past decade, they have opted not to sign big, already established players and instead signed promising talents to develop.  This has worked relatively well for them, as they are in the top 4 every year.  The problem is that they haven't won any trophies (besides last year) and, more worryingly, they have lost they best players many years in a row.  This is because their players see the lack of big signings as a lack of ambition.  While getting top 4 every year would be great for us, it should not be our ultimate goal.  We need to be winning trophies, and there is only one way to do that in the long run: big signings.  


TL;DR: If we don't make marquee signings (at least occasionally), we will end up like Arsenal has been for the past decade: relatively successful while never winning anything and losing all of their best players to more ""ambitious"" team.

&gt;Coulibaly gave us a first half lead from the penalty spot after Gunners skipper Isaac Hayden was sent off for bringing down Ruben **Lameiras**, before Winks wrapped up a comfortable victory in the closing stages of the second period.

&gt;Our first clear-cut chance fell to Coulibaly after 12 minutes, but the striker dragged his shot wide after a neat interchange with **Lameiras**

&gt;Semi Ajayi slid in to deny Oduwa as he tried to convert **Lameiras'** through pass.

&gt;Ogilvie won a tackle in midfield and fed **Lameiras** who showed lightning-quick footwork to trick his way between Ajayi and Hayden - the latter tripping him as he went through.

&gt;We began the second period in the ascendancy too, Oduwa finding the side netting from a tight angle on the left and McEvoy being denied by Siemann before **Lameiras** curled a shot over the top.

&gt;**Lameiras** and Coulibaly both tested Macey around the hour mark before Oduwa nearly doubled our lead. He latched onto the latest **Lameiras** through ball and, after seeing his initial shot blocked by Macey, he got a second bite of the cherry - only for Siemann to block.

&gt;On 62 minutes **Lameiras** showed great vision to play McEvoy in behind the defence

&gt; **Lamerias**, though, was unable to cap a fine performance on the night with a goal as he sent the set piece over the top.

&gt;Macey spooned another **Lamerias** effort behind for a corner shortly afterwards, before the same player was off target after a clever one-two with Winks.

We also have Marcus Edwards, who plays for England u16's and is a bit of a prodigy. [Here's a clip of him in 2010, Afro kid in the black kit - doesn't do anything tbf lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0NjmWDoJfU) and Alfie Whiteman is another player to look out for.

true,TurbanCowboy,lfc68,,"Fucking hell. The whole 'we need a marquee' signing is so tiresome. Brendan Rodgers is about the *team* and the *squad*. Last year we had the former but not the latter. All the steps we've taken so far this summer are to ensure we now have a squad. Just look at Lallana's injury and what it means - we'll still have Markovic, Remy, Borini (if he stays), Lambert, and Can all able to slot in the positions he'd possibly play in (out wide/central). That's depth. These are players that fit the bill, that Brendan wanted, and are good enough. 

We didn't make a 'marquee' signing last season and we played the best football we've played in years and challenged for the title. The last time we challenged for the title before then we signed Robbie Keane and David N'gog. A marquee signing means nothing. It's about the manager's ideas being properly implemented and having players that buy into his vision. Not reputation and a big price tag. 

Markovic is one of the brightest young talents in world football. As is Emre Can. Sterling, Coutinho, and Ibe are all a year older and a year wiser. What else do people want exactly? Show some bloody faith in the management. ",0,1406400845,null,0,false,0,cj8iix1,t3_2bs2u3,t1_cj8iix1,t3_2bs2u3,null,1434912060,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,iamaravind,lfc12,,"lol okay that was fair argument, but here's my two cents on why a marquee signing is not required.

One, people always love to quote the Arsenal example when talking about not buying any big name players and having to sell their own stars. The reason they did that, and adopted a buying youngsters only transfer strategy was that the new stadium they had just built required significant funding from the club, which took away their ability to really spend in the market. Google this if you have to, but Arsene only switched to buying young players when construction of the Emirates began. Before that they had no qualms about signing players like Henry and Bergkamp, and now Ozil and Sanchez. It was just something that had to be done for a while to balance the books.

Moving on, buying big name stars does yes add quality to the team but brings on massive risk as well. Sure they can play out really well a la Ronaldo, Bale and Aguero, but they could backfire at the expense of the team like our shit with Carrol, Torres and Shevshenko. Carrol, yes does not quite fit that world class marquee signing mould, but when we signed him we payed as much as City did for Aguero, on the back of an impressive first half of a season for Newcastle. So expectations were really high.

Signing players like this, mean that they are a guaranteed a place in your team, no matter their form or effort in training, to validate the large outlay. All the signings we have made to date on the other hand are not guaranteed their place in the team, which means that any player in our sqaud can be starting in their position if they impress the gaffer with their hard work and play. This ensures that only the best, most hungriest players go out to start every game, and ensures the competition in the sqaud is high, motivating players to succeed.

Marquee signings are not needed when you have such a young talented squad as ours, cause we players that have the potential to be world class. Think back to when Pep Guardiola took over Barca, his only big signing were Dani Alves and Pique, who at the time was not considered world class. His method was to instead develop the existing players at the squad, and bring on players from the reserves that they had developed like Pedro and Busquets. That worked out well for them winning the Champions Leauge comfortably. When they signed Zlatan the next season to match Real's Ronaldo/Kaka/Benzema move, the results were still good but not as successful. He didnt manage to adapt and they wasted a lot of money on his signing when he was loaned to Milan and sold at a cut price.

Tl;DR : Marquee signings are not needed to be successful if you already have a solid team with promising youngsters. They can disrupt the balance of the team, have immense pressure on them to validate the price, and the risk of flopping would be a detriment to the success of the team

true,Jlowry13,,Newry. 384 1st pref votes. Baird's sausage rolls,"&gt;I think the park at the bottom of Barcroft and the flags there abouts aren't an issue as it is a nationalist area. 

It is an issue, just because no prods live in the area (I'll give you three guesses as to why) doesn't mean there aren't any to be offended, it is an official branding that Prods are not welcome in that area, and by extension Newry as a whole, and given Sinn Fein's blatant disregard for the equality impact assessment shows they just don't care about Prods at all.

Now you may say that its really of no issue as Prods don't live in the area they're not going to have to see it and all what ever excuse you want but the fact of the matter is that's demonstrably nonsense. The park is right beside the SRC, it you want an education, it's there. It's right across the road from the sports centre (where the votes for all the council seats in the area are counted) its not something that's easy avoided.

And that's before you bring up the issue about what sort of an example is it setting for the children who use the park.

&gt;In the same way you wouldn't go into to the Newtownards road and ask them to remove their flags and emblems etc you cant expect the people of Barcroft et al to do the same. The important thing about the whole ""shared space"" idea is that you recognise the rights of certain parts of the community to celebrate aspects of their history that you may not necessarily agree with. 

I fully agree with the idea of shared space the issue here is that Sinn Fein obviously have some issues with it, why is Bessbrook a shared space but Newry city centre isn't?

&gt;A good example is on the 12th of July you have boys marching in old time UVF uniforms and at Easter republican parades you have boys marching in IRA uniforms from 1916. Whilst you might like one, both or neither you have to respect a communities ability to 'celebrate' its 'culture' in ways that may not appear appealing to you. You might think the old UVF men are heroes of Northern Ireland and deserve all the praise we can give, you may just see the parade as loyalists trotting out emblems of the good old days when they were in charge. You may see the men of 1916 as revolutionary heroes, you may see them as the blood stained fore fathers of the PIRA. 

I'm not denying people should be able to express themselves, Nationalists are perfectly free to express themselves throughout the entire Newry area, in some cases policing their own parades, we're lucky to get our one parade a year into the city centre never mind police it ourselves.

&gt;The crucial thing is that you recognise more than one point of view exists(and certainly more than the black and white examples I have used but you get the idea) and respect the rights of those who chose to express themselves lawfully. 

I totally agree but why should the right to express yourself be dependent upon where you live?",0,1406401855,null,0,false,0,cj8iy75,t3_2borok,t1_cj8iy75,t1_cj7z8gr,null,1434912333,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,Shploosh,lfc87,,"I realize that Arsene only stopped buying big name players because the club couldn't afford to, but that only proves my point even more.  They stopped being as successful around the time that they stopped spending big money on players.  The reason that they stopped spending money doesn't matter to this conversation; we are only looking at the results of not making marquee signings.

The only reason we payed so much for Carroll was because we needed a striker at the last minute and everyone knew that we had just gotten huge money for Torres.  I won't consider him a ""marquee"" signing because it's not only about cost, but about the quality of the player as well.  Torres was good, but he was also coming off an injury that affected his pace, arguably one of his biggest strengths.  It's hardly surprising that he didn't keep up his form at Chelsea, though I will admit that nobody could have predicted just how bad he would be.    

I agree with a lot of what you say.  Signing expensive players does come with a lot of risks, and it definitely isn't the perfect solution for building our team up over the coming years.  I love that Liverpool gives young players with potential a chance to shine and develop, but I don't think that we should place all of our eggs in one basket.  I'm not saying that we *only* need marquee signings to be successful, but rather that at least a few marquee signings every once in a while is necessary to build an even better team while also showing the rest of the world that we are serious about being one of the top teams in Europe.  I would say that even though marquee signings can be risky, buying players with potential can be even riskier.  A big player turning out to be a bad transfer looks bad because they carry large prices, but if you think about it a few failed prospects (especially at the prices that we have payed this window) can be just as financially devastating as one big player not working out.  Not to mention, it is way more likely that a young player won't fulfill his potential than an already established star turning out to not work for us. 

Also, I don't think we should spend big just for the sake of spending big.  I think that if a big name player is available in a position we need, and Brendan Rodgers thinks he will work in our system, then we should absolutely be willing to pay big money.  However, if a big name player that might not fit our system is available, I would rather see us pass him up for a few lads with potential that would fit our system.  

TL;DR: We need a combination of marquee signings and young players with potential because they both serve different purposes.

Since I last looked up what this meant I've already forgotten, so here it is for others:

&gt; **Social Justice Warrior**. A pejorative term for an individual who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation. A social justice warrior, or SJW, does not necessarily strongly believe all that they say, or even care about the groups they are fighting on behalf of. They typically repeat points from whoever is the most popular blogger or commenter of the moment, hoping that they will ""get SJ points"" and become popular in return. They are very sure to adopt stances that are ""correct"" in their social circle.

&gt; The SJW's favorite activity of all is to dogpile. Their favorite websites to frequent are Livejournal and Tumblr. They do not have relevant favorite real-world places, because SJWs are primarily civil rights activists only online.

If you fall out and there are any disputes about the utility bills, all responsibility would land on you if you are the only account holder. It's simple, you phone up the utilities company and say you want to add someone, then pass the phone over so your flatmate can give their details.

As to 1), in this case I'm surprised the landlord doesn't just include the gas in the rent and pay it himself from that. As /u/grounderror suggested, get in touch and see what arrangements can be made, and perhaps ask what previous tenants did.

2) Water cannot be legally turned off. Gas/elec I think can be, but I think is very unlikely unless the previous tenant didn't pay for a long long time, like years. Just be sure to get the meter readings from the day you move in (photograph them), so you don't get stuck paying for anything the previous tenants didn't pay.

3) Water, look online for who your local water supplier is and phone them to let them know when you're moving in to the property. Some letting agencies do this for you with all the utilities but it's worth making sure they have the right info. Some water companies let you do this online, but I think it's best to take the time to make a phone call, as they can clear up any questions you have.

It's barely detectable in the vapour being breathed out. It has no effect on anyone and doesn't smell.

There comes a point in the discussion of freedom where your freedom to ""not want ""smoke"" in your face"" becomes an unreasonable desire when opposed to my desire to vape. Since it's harmless, why should your desire be counted above mine? I mightn't like the smell of your aftershave. Seriously, no one wears Jazz any more. I shouldn't have to put up with it on a train. Therefore, we should ban aftershave, right?

I cannot for the life of me remember who it was or what 'department' she was in, but since you are taking all of your classes from one of the colleges instead of different one, I would say that you are less likely to run into the same issue I did because each college is very aware of their scheduling (or so I was told when I asked why it was happening).

As far as eating and groceries you can always go into town and get something cheap. There is also a cafeteria-style eating place in Bramber house where the Co-op is that was pretty cheap for what they offered, and the two pubs on campus that are run by the student union. Brighton has many many grocery stores all around, but the one I would usually go to was the Sainsbury's Super Store on Lewis road, it has bus stops right out front and they come every ten minutes or so (it's about the size of a regular supermarket in the states while the regular ones are very small). Also, you may want to try and put some larger bottles of shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, whatever in the suitcase you plan to ship because for some reason I found toiletries kind of expensive for what they were compared to the states and the selection was very slim.

Other popular grocery stores that I went to were Tesco's and Marks &amp; Spencer's. Marks &amp; Spencer's was one of my favorites because they just seemed a bit higher quality and to have a slightly better variety in what you could get there (the best dutch yogurt hands down!), but they were a bit of a further bus ride into the city center. I mostly cooked my own meals (usually for the week's dinners; lots of pasta and rice...) and I would by a bagleman or a sandwich at the Co-op on campus for lunch and it worked out alright. I didn't want to spend an exorbitant amount on food because I wanted most of my money to go towards travel. I went to Rome, Florence, and Venice for two weeks when there was a break, and then to Paris at the end of the semester before flying back to the states.

When I went to US it was the last time they had a September program so international students could have a full semester because their fall semester used to start in October. It was just international students taking only one class (met twice a week if I remember correctly) and the rest of the week we could do whatever. They offered many reasonable trips that we could all purchase and go on, so if they still do that I would definitely do a few of them. I did the walking tour of London and the Stone Hinge/Bath one (stone hinge is very very anticlimactic, but you should at least see it once just to say you did I suppose; Bath was a beautiful city and if you're a big Jane Austin fan then they have a museum their, too). If you plan on flying to other parts of Europe if you get a break, I would go on cheapoair.com and look at what Easyjet offers (they were a really cheap and decent airline). Also hostelworld.com for cheap hostels in whatever area you plan to visit. Make sure that when you look at hostels to prioritize proximity to ATMs and metro stations, do they provide or rent towels and bedsheets, do that have A/C, do they have wi-fi. Also most places in Europe (especially automated ticket terminals) only take cards with pin in chip technology. America has dragged it's feet in this area, hence all the huge identity thefts we have here from retailers like target. So, carry cash with you always, and your passport to get into pubs and such.

I am sure we can offer him a higher salary also, I know that famously Diego was on a massive wage when he was there- but I am sure nobody in the club would mind if Lukaku came in as our highest earner, as they all know his class. 

The friend factor is worth taking into account, but he must have made good friends at Everton- and it is well reported that he and Mirallas enjoy spending time together in locked hotel rooms. He also seems to really respect Martinez, and I am sure Bobby would have let him know how he plans to develop him as a footballer if he did sign for us long term. 

If he went that I wouldn't be shocked- it may end up being a case of us not wanting to shell out what Chelsea want, or we may not want to offer the type of terms that Rom wants...

Basically, there are lots of indirect benefits to members of the Commonwealth that whilst don't have short-term gain, will have a substantial long-term gain.

I rewatched the Iran game the other day because I had a few hours to burn on the train- and he was really impressive. He kind of reminds me of a younger Carrick, he has a long way to go, but he has good technique with both feet, and when coupled with his physicality he is almost impossible to force into making a bad pass. 

Off the ball he is far more aggressive  than Carrick, and he is forced to use his physicality more than I would like here. He reminds me Joe Parkinson a bit in that respect, but however good Parkie was (and he really, really was), I feel the game has moved on a lot.

 To play that sort of style you need to be 100% fit, because any weakness leaves you exposed. Just look at what happened with Lucas for the shite- guy looked world class, got injured and was never the same again. The midfielders who succeed long term in the modern game are the ones who are more cultured, and read the game (Carrick as the prime example), rather than having to commit time and again. Jimmy McCarthy is amazingly cultured for a young kid, and Barry, although hugely aggressive- is never chasing lost causes or making silly runs, so I think Besic will take a lot from playing alongside them.  

Obviously a higher level of opposition await him, but he has all the potential to be a star in our side. Let's just hope he understands the meaning behind that blue shirt, and what an honor it is, because if he does- he will be huge.

What's unique about Liverpool is that everything else is cheap. It's a very affordable city. There are more restaurants where you can get a very nice dinner for 2 for under £30, than any other place I've been in the UK.

true,Mhoeb,1972crest,,"I understand that it must be frustrating for you to see things changing at the club, and this comment is in no way an endorsement of raised ticket prices, but the vitriol with which you lace your comments, either explicitly or implicitly in regards to foreign fans, is really disheartening. I'm absolutely positive that there are ""gloryhunters"" out there, but that's the cost of being a successful team. Now maybe you'd give back some of our recent successes if it meant the club wouldn't be experiencing these changes, and I suppose I would understand where you'd be coming from.  

Foreign supporters like me understand the limitations of our fandom, we understand that there is an entire experience of supporting city that we cannot relate to or understand, we take no joy in seeing increased ticket prices, we understand that football is about community, that a club is built from, and is a reflection of its local community. In my case, this is why I fell in love with the game, its unlike anything we have in my country. We know that we are not and will never be able to artificially become a part of that incredibly special relationship. I'm consistently written off as a glory hunter by supporters of other clubs who know nothing about how/when I came to support city, but to hear it from within our own ranks is a completely different level of demoralizing.

The reality of our club is that its completely and thoroughly globalized, for better or for worse. We're owned by a sheikh, managed by a Chilean, captained by a Belgian, frustrated with an Ivorian, enamored with a gaggle of Spaniards, inspired by Argentinians, sold shampoo by an Englishman, etc. I don't understand how for some, when it comes to legitimate supporters, the script completely changes. 

Now this is not to say that I think prices should be increased- it really does sicken me to think that lifelong supporters (like you I can only assume) could be priced out, and the guilt that I feel in thinking that, as a foreign fan, I could be in some way responsible, that guilt is very real. The global nature of our club is not a device that I'm using to push some agenda- it's irrefutable fact. We are not the first club experience this growth, nor will we be the last.

There is no way to intellectually or emotionally equate my experience as a supporter to that of a Mancunian who pays his/her hard earned money to support the club they love. This isn't news to me, and I and most like me easily understand this. But the elation that I felt on 93.20, the disappointment I feel after a loss, the fervency with which I follow our every move during transfer season, these are all very real experiences to me.

I apologize if I'm completely off base with this comment (a significant possibility) but I suppose this just presented me with an opportunity to get something off my chest that's sat with me essentially since I fell in love with the game.

Rodgers saw the talent in them and developed them into the stars they are today. I have complete faith in him to do the same with the likes of Markovic, Can, and Lallana too. 

I'm saying the marquee signing thing is nonsense. It's unfounded. EDIT: And I'm saying trust the management because with practically no transfer kitty and bringing in the likes of Aspas, and Cissokho and Moses on loan, we played our best football and made a real push for the title.

We need to be open to the truth but we also need to be mindful of scaremongering.

Other nicotine replacement therapies are available on the NHS. The difference is they are geared towards giving up and stopping, vaping is not geared towards anything. Anecdotal evidence alert: I tried loads of things and came to the conclusion that I like smoking. I like inhaling and exhaling.

Non-smokers will have a hard time dealing with that. It's almost a taboo opinion. But I actually like vaping - i'm not doing it to quit. If there are no health effects from it I will do it, unless something happens, for as long as I can see. I like it. Most people won't understand that it's not just about replacing nicotine. It's about the whole thing - the hobby, the process. Maybe that is only a thing for me because of years of nicotine addition, I admit that. But then there are plenty of people vaping nicotine free liquids.

It's an extremely complex issue that all comes down to this - does it hurt me and does it hurt you if I do it near you. If the answer is no to both, or even a bit to both - then it's my choice and you (not you specifically) have no right to stop me doing it. Your cars hurt my kids. your food hurts my environment. Your clothes are made in sweatshops. Everything - well nearly - has some sort of negative effect on something. Until vaping is proven to, or at least even linked to, some sort of negative effect - people should fuck off and pick another thing to have a go at. And if it can be used to lessen the amount of people smoking then I really can't see any argument against it.

&gt; it is an official branding that Prods are not welcome in that area

I would 100% disagree with that. You on a personal level may feel unwelcome and that is sad(if its any consolation as a Newry man and a nationalist I extend all possible welcomes to you). But you do not speak for all protestants no more than the name of that park speaks for how people in that area feel about protestants. It is a commemoration of a hunger striker, for you to extrapolate that all protestants are unwelcome off the back of it is a fairly big step. This is the problem with NI. When one community is expressing itself it is not at the cost of an another nor is it threatening another. Of course in some instances it can be but I don't feel that was the name of this parks intended purpose. 

&gt; Sinn Fein obviously have some issues with it

Take it up with them my man I'm not associated with them and never intend to be. 

&gt; I'm not denying people should be able to express themselves, Nationalists are perfectly free to express themselves throughout the entire Newry area, in some cases policing their own parades, we're lucky to get our one parade a year into the city centre never mind police it ourselves

Take it up with the Parades commission, the PSNI, Stormont or whoever you feel will be best able to effect the change you think necessary. I was merely using the parades as an analogy. 

&gt; I totally agree but why should the right to express yourself be dependent upon where you live?

You see here is the thing. It shouldn't be but in NI it is. I think the discussion we are having here shows that there does need to be some consensus on dealing with the past. The GFA signed in 1998 brought us peace(relatively) but it cannot do away with the past 40(or 100, or 200 or however far back you want to go) years of history. As a society we need our political leaders to facilitate a dialogue which will allow us to deal with the past. Obviously the Hass talks didn't work out but at least the idea was there!

This has fuck all to do with Left/Right politics. The most rabidly anti-tobacco person I know is a died in the wool Tory who actually advocates criminalising smoking. I'm a more liberal-minded Lefty and think that's utterly absurd.

As for vaping: I think it's highly probable it will prove to be a considerably less harmful activity than smoking and for that reason I would definitely encourage taking it up in preference to tobacco smoking.  

That said, the health effects from vaping are still relatively unknown and while that's the case I would prefer my nearest &amp; dearest and I not be subject to secondary inhalation.

It's important that you understand that I speak from a postion of someone who started attending City games when we were at the lowest point in our history. I started going to Maine Road in 1998, the year we were in the 3rd tier.

I grew up, went to schools, in a city in which MCFC played in the shadows of a 'super club'. A corporate monster, which drew supporters from all over the country, and abroad.

These supporters were only attracted to United for the glamour, they were shallow and fickle, and they took great pleasure in ridiculing City, in spite of all the success they enjoyed.

We saw ourselves as the true Manchester club, *real* football supporters, who followed our club not because it was fashionable or glamorous, but because they were our local club, and we prided ourselves on that loyalty.

This is why it particularly irks to see those same caricature gloryhunters becoming City fans now.

I won't generalise of course, and not all new fans are that particular type of supporter, but those caricature type fans do exist.

And while that's not a major issue (as you said, it's an inevitability given the now global nature of the game), it becomes one when these people replace the core supporters. 

I accept that we have new fans, and I genuinely have no problem with them attending City games, I welcome them. But what shouldn't happen is those new fans attending games at the expense of the long standing supporters. That is what brings out the vitriol as you put it, because it's a major cause of resentment among long standing fans.

We've seen it happen at other clubs, and we don't want to see it happen at City. And we didn't think it would given we were promised that it wouldn't.

There is no problem as long as ticket prices remain reasonable, and thus the core support will not be priced out. But once the ticket prices go crazy, due to a new demand of tickets which didn't exist not so long ago, from new supporters, then the core support become slowly squeezed out while the new fans come in.

I don't think anyone would agree that that is acceptable.

The club doesn't care though, they just want to charge the most money feasibly possible for match tickets.

With the increases in the capacity of the stadium new supporters could be easily accommodated, but at this rate a lot of the long standing supporters will be priced out of the existing areas of the stadium and long standing supporters might eventually become a minority, with new fans filling the extending areas, and the existing ones.

And with that goes the whole culture of this football club.

That's what we fear most. We don't fear new fans, they're not the 'boogeymen'. We fear City becoming United mark II, we fear City losing its identity and becoming everything we used to despise.

I hope you can recognise that it isn't personal, most of my anger is reserved solely for the club.

Fans, new and old, should be enjoying the journey of watching City becoming a world super power together, instead it's looking increasingly like that is merely a pipe dream, and City have succumb to greed.",0,1406413046,null,0,false,0,cj8nqh3,t3_2brvhj,t1_cj8nqh3,t1_cj8mwt2,null,1434915029,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

&gt;

&gt;The __52-hertz whale__ is an individual of unidentified whale species, which has been regularly detected in many locations since the 1980s, calling at the very unusual frequency of 52 [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hz). This pitch is much higher frequency than that of the [Blue Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Whale) (15-20Hz) or [Fin Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_Whale) (20Hz), whose migration patterns it is most similar to.  It appears to be the only individual with this [call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_sound), and has hence been described as the world's loneliest whale.

Just for clarity's sake (if you're interested):

I have no problem with new fans, you can't blame young kids abroad for liking a great football team, especially if they're from a country where there are no great football teams.

What I don't like is new fans who were adolescents/adults when City were midtable, but didn't care about us, or support us, and only once we became a top side did they declare themselves 'City fans'. I detest that, gloryhunting at its purest.

If you're from the UK, most people will have a professional football club of the two or three top divisions within their towns or cities.

If you shun those clubs for a Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Barcelona, Real Madrid, then you're a gloryhunter.

When I started attending City games at Maine Road we were a 3rd division club.

If people like me didn't support our local club then, City wouldn't be what it is now.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"&gt; Didn't I just demonstrate in my last post that the economy can grow without increased pollution?

You absolutely did not.  What you showed was that if economic growth had been less, then all other things being the same the amount of CO2 / dollar (the 2 per capitas should cancel out, which is how I know you suck at maths) would have been slightly less.  That still implies that CO2 (or whatever measure of pollution you want to measure) is *created for each dollar of GDP*.  This means that the amount of pollution created is *proportional* to GDP.  GDP is growing exponentially, therefore CO2 will grow exponentially, QED.  In order for your statement to hold, you would have to *remove* CO2 from the atmosphere, which brings us to thermodynamics.

I'm using physics words because they're appropriate, relevant and because I understand them, having a masters degree in the subject.  I am quite aware that the earth is not a closed system.  I am *also* quite aware that we are creating entropic waste products (such as CO2, slag heaps from burning coal, mine tailings and rubbish tips).  We are also creating these waste products at a much faster rate than the planets natural systems can deal with them, and faster than any PV powered system could ever hope to deal with them.  Annually we burn carbon equivalent to roughly 400 times the planet's productivity [source](http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange1.pdf), making any natural decomposition of those wastes effectively negligible.  Which means that these waste products are now starting to impact human life in a number of locations and ways.

I can't be arsed dealing with your last paragraph because the statement "" Those all have clearly defined value yet can take up effectively 0 resources to produce."" is such a fucking laughable load of bollocks.

And, as I've said elsewhere, there is no such thing as the UK economy.  There is one hyper-complex and eeply interconnected global economic system, which has an expression in the UK.  The ""UK economy"" is in no way independent of the rest of the world in any way, and as such it is effectively meaningless to consider it as such.  In addition, there is only one planet we're living on, and frankly it doesn't recognise national borders when it comes to economic production.  Only global economic figures have any meaning in this context.",0,1406415367,null,0,false,0,cj8opiz,t3_2bodot,t1_cj8opiz,t1_cj8bu69,null,1434915489,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There are no considerable advantages to allowing mass immigration, it creates competition for minimum or low-wage jobs which means that the poorest in society are the ones that miss out.

But with immigration of adults it doesn't fit in with the natural order because now you have competition for jobs that aren't there.

Not sure where you're getting human rights out of, although I'm pretty sure that those attending the rally today are very much in favour of Palestinians having the same rights as Israelis. 

But since you've brought up human rights though, remember it was the Catholics who were denied the same rights as Protestants at the hands of the unionist majority at Stormont back in the 60's and 70's.

So actually the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (whose leadership was made up of both Catholics and Protestants) had plenty of rallies calling for equal human rights in our country.

Since half of all smokers die of a smoking related disease, that's 25000 people dying a year.

Back of a fag packet calculations I know, but if there's no known harmful effects of vaping, but a known death rate for smoking, it would seem illogical to me to restrict it, given the numbers involved.

I suppose the main argument is that - you choose to do it, I choose not to - given the risks are small, but there is a small risk, why should your behaviour affect me? The answer is that it shouldn't. But there is a view that your car shouldn't affect me either. And it does. And yet people drive and cars produce waste products that are harmful. So the balance is around the benefit of the ""thing that causes harm"" vs the effect to innocents due to the ""thing that causes harm"". And what that line is - I don't know. It's an interesting question really.

That's why I think safe standing is the only possible way, this new expansion will help, but I don't think prices will go down. There's certainly enough public interest at the moment that Lineker etc are getting on to that all the premier league clubs might do a token subsidy gesture some time soon but again, it's only a short term solution.

I saw someone on twitter saying that this whole Cityzen membership thing (which is obviously a massive farce) stands to make the club around 1.8 million in a year (not sure how they'd worked it out, but maths isn't my strong point) which is 100k less a year than we pay Scott Sinclair!

There's no global footballing superpower which isn't like United's now, Barca is 70% tourists, Real Madrid is only tourists as far as I can tell, and that's how it's going to be for us. The only clubs that do it well are the German ones, and what's the biggest difference? Safe standing and good ticketing prices. But Bayern are fan run and have never needed significant investment, Dortmund I know less about but they're not really as big a club as City plan to be, despite obviously recent successes.

America on the other hand is funding Israel with billions of dollars in military funding, as well as propaganda support and so on. *That's* why we were at the gates of the US consulate today. 

The war in Syria is a completely different affair. The Israeli army have the most sophisticated military technology on the planet... they have no excuses for killing innocent children. 

Civilians caught up in the war on Syria have been able to flee the country and seek refuge elsewhere, the people of Gaza do not have this ability. They live in an open-air prison. 

There are people and organisations already helping the people in these other conflicts, Israel and Egypt control the borders to Gaza - people and supplies are extremely difficult to get in to help the people there because of the restrictions Israel has placed on the tiny piece of land there. 

Also, the amount of Palestinians that have been killed in such a short space of time (&lt; 2 weeks) is significant. 

A lot of people at this rally today are in political parties and organisations who regularly call for an end to ALL wars and who campaign on behalf of organisations like Amnesty International. You can't just assume that everyone who attended the rally doesn't care about all the other 'worse' things that are happening in the world. 

The only point I'll agree on is that the press perhaps spend more time talking about the Israel/Palestine issue than they perhaps should, because it's a conflict that many generations of people have strong views about since it has occurred over such a long period of time and many countries have been pushing out propaganda for either side of the argument as well.

He may not have showed his dark side right away, but committing genocide on the Daleks without out a second thought despite pleas from Donna, seems pretty dark to me (even War and nine gave what the did a great deal of thought).

I graduated with a First in Computer Science and had offers thrown at me in the 19k-21k range as I was a graduate, one place then offered me 23k as they said I was an ideal candidate.

No, but he could have started over Oscar last Season quite easily.

Marin and Schurrle are players that can move around the pitch, Schurrle can play on the right, on the left, central, striker, anything that's needed (he's best on the left, btw).

Marin wasn't given the chance to play, the same with De Bruyne (DBs shit as well, right? £20m shit).

He's a great little player, good enough for any Team if given the chance and position he needs, his foot work is beautiful to watch.

Imagine Hazard, Schurrle, De Bruyne, Marin and Mata playing in the same attacking force, it would have been PHENOMENAL.

And I don't mention Oscar because for me, he isn't good enough for the positions he's in (RW and CAM don't work for him in the BPL).",0,1406419864,null,0,1406420235,0,cj8qhxl,t3_2bs228,t1_cj8qhxl,t1_cj8q1yz,null,1434916363,-4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-4

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"I don't agree. We could end up avoiding having a crowd like United if we remained affordable and kept ticket prices within a reasonable range. Of course success will attract new fans, some of them totally plastic, but they wouldn't become a significant proportion of the match day crowd without increases in ticket prices which priced out the long serving blues.

But the club are ruthlessly pursuing an agenda of increasing match day income, with a total disregard of the effect on the fanbase.

And it's particularly galling because I think we're in a position where it isn't even necessary from a financial perspective.

Increases in the cost of match tickets and season tickets would represent a mere fraction of gain to our overall income. I don't think FFP serves as justification, merely an excuse.

Safe standing could be an answer, but only if it meant significantly cheaper tickets in those areas, and it still wouldn't be enough if the general theme in the rest of the ground continued. It'd be like attempting to heal a deep gangrenous wound by covering it with a plaster. 

I think that the overall theme at City, and across the league is fucking reprehensible, clubs here in England have been taking the piss for too long.

An interesting point about the wagebill, we have the highest wagebill in world sport. What is an extra one or two million a year in revenue from increasing ticket prices?

Yaya earns a million in a month.

If we were really concerned about FFP or our revenue we could alter our wagebill, and stop paying squad players like Sinclair and Garcia circa 60 or 70 grand a week, and then struggling to sell them because of said absurd wage and clubs refusing to meet it.

We got around £60 million just in domestic TV money last season.

United have just signed a kit deal with Adidas worth £75 million a year. In comparison we currently earn a mere £12 million a year from Nike, similar to what QPR earn from them.

These are all things we could look at as an alternative to ripping off the fans who made this club what it is today, from pricing them out of supporting the club they've stood by for decades.

We don't have to sell our soul to be a footballing superpower.

Like you said, safe standing would represent a start, but I'm sceptical it'll ever happen, and I think there's a strong likelihood the club could just use it as a token gesture much like 'Value Gold'.

I'll admit, I hadn't considered the possibility of ""turning into another United"" a serious fear for local supporters, but it seems completely well reasoned and understandable, especially for you and supporters like you who were in the proverbial trenches and took god-only-knows what kind of abuse. Again, due to sheer geography, these are the types of experiences I couldn't possibly have been exposed to, sentiments I may have been completely ignorant of had you not explained it. But I get it. Thank you.  

I'd seen your comments on a couple of other posts on this sub, and I've seen the people who generally respond to you.These people who are reactionary enough to use their internet anonymity to go toe-to-toe with you in arguments that would almost universally end in ad-hominem bullshit, these people don't exactly present a good image for foreign fans. I'm definitely aware of this, and 'caricature' is probably a fair word.

Part of the reason for my comment was to discuss some things I'd been thinking about, but admittedly there was a part of me that wanted to engage you as a foreign supporter who rarely ever comments at all, and who is eager to understand the experiences of the locals who've made this club what it is, who's attendance at third tier games made it possible for the club to become what it has.

Your comments on the clubs declination into a frenzy of greedy cash grabbing is troubling. These are issues that aren't often discussed, but need to be reflected on in a serious way. However, in looking not only at the landscape of world football, but at the nature of the global economy, I'm sad to say that I tend to meet hope for any kind of pluralistic altruism with profound pessimism. It is especially sad in football, that clubs like city who relied so heavily on their local supporters at their lowest moments so soon seem to forget them at their highest. But this scenario wouldn't be unfamiliar in the business world, and its increasingly looking as though this is the world that football inhabits.

To prevent this from happening http://cdn.gifbay.com/2013/01/angry_cristiano_ronaldo-23583.gif one of the wingers, in this game mostly Townsend will support him. If it looks like a stressful situation is about to happen the second winger and AMF will push up too. This creates a pretty interesting situation. Capoue and Mason are the centerpiece in this kind of defending. If Townsend goes chasing the ball, his DMF is covering for him while the other takes the middle. It seems like we want the one on one situations to involve our Fullbacks pretty excluisvly. Makes sense to get Davies to cover up for an accident prone Rose if that is the case. 

Also if both wingers a apply pressure, mason and capoue will actually pull out pretty wide, and Dawson takes a step up to interrupt any ball going long. And if the wingers are not up applying pressure they will take Capue/Masons place to support the fullback while Capoue basicly becomes a third CB. This means that the goal seems to be apply tons of pressure, if they get past that pressure, stall for time untill the wingers are back in position and then start the pressure again. 

The two most interesting conclutions I will draw from that is that we will put a lot of faith in Walker/Davies to one on one their man and whoever has Capoues role (wich he has had in all 3 matches, might be a sign that Poch has a lot of faith in him) has a massive responsibility in getting his positioning right.",0,1406423041,null,0,false,0,cj8rqb9,t3_2btizh,t1_cj8rqb9,t3_2btizh,null,1434917090,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16

You should post more often as you're clearly an intelligent bloke with much to contribute.

I'm glad you engaged me on the topic. Like you observed, most, in fact all of the times this topic had been raised on this subreddit most people contribute nothing but ad hominem attacks. They create a straw man and do their best to undermine the whole issue.

That's offensive, given how sensitive this topic is, and quite honestly sometimes I have responded harshly given I've often taken offence.

You're the first person on this subreddit to tackle me sincerely and fairly on this subreddit.

And I genuinely appreciate it.

You've demonstrated a respect for the core support, this club, and its culture, and that means a lot.

I'd gladly welcome you to a game. Show you around etc.

It's fans like you we need.

People with a disregard of this club's history and culture, and what it means to City fans?

Not so much.

But please do stick around mate, we could do with more redditors who genuinely contribute to the sub.

I'd also like to apologise to you if I've offended you at any previous points where I've have had said negative engages with other redditors. Such exchanges can bring out the worst of me, and I wouldn't like to have offended someone like yourself.

They then admit that the lack of civilian casualties can also largely be pinned on the presence of early warning systems that enable people to evacuate before the rocket hits.  Given the highly localised nature of the Iron Dome systems (currently there are 9 batteries in place protecting specific urban areas), it's also very likely that a lot of rockets are not intercepted because they're not going to hit anything worthwhile.  This isn't to say that the rockets themselves aren't dangerous, but that they are poorly aimed therefore unable to hit their intended targets.  It's fair to say that the effectiveness of Hamas' rockets is little, but I don't think that can be equated to the argument that they are somehow insignificant.  Any rocket which successfully landed on its intended target would cause a large amount of damage (which is the intention of those who fire them).

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"I'd worry most about City and United, then Arsenal.

City, the reasons are obvious.

United are my number 2 worry. Van Gaal seems to have the team clicking and they have and easier start to the season than all the other big teams. That nice start will give them time to fine tune things against EPL level teams. Van Gaal has them playing a 3-5-2, which I think a lot of lesser managers won't be used to playing against. Without the distraction of Europe and a squad who has something to prove after a terrible last year, I think they will be a completely different team than we saw last year. With maybe one or two more signings, I think they could still be in the running come April/May.

Arsenal seem to have the same problem they always do. Lack of depth. They still have yet to sign a striker, or a proper DM. They remind me a bit of our team under RDM/Rafa. Defensively sound, tons of talent in their band of attacking mids, but no physical presence in their midfield and an inconsistent striker (although ours wasn't inconsistent, he was just consistently shit). Just like last season, I expect them to beat the little teams and get pummeled by the big ones. If they can stay injury free, I'll worry about them, but I'll worry more about one of those flying pigs shitting on me.

I would just like to mention how I feel about Liverpool, too. They just sold their best player, basically rebuilt half their team, and will get bogged down with Champions League. I am feeling a Spurs type meltdown this year.

My prediction for the season:

1. Chelsea

2. City

Your lungs get pretty fucked up and clogged with all the crap in traditional fags, but vaping lets you ingest small particles of liquid into your lungs that release the chemicals instead.

As far as I'm aware, vaping doesn't do anywhere near as much damage to your lungs as traditional fags, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. (Also, please feel free to let me know if anyone knows exactly what physical damage vaping causes to your lungs.)

Psychological addiction? I think they're about the same on that count. Nicotine is the main addictive ingredient in both, and it's incredibly effective as a stimulant and a very addictive substance.
