But why let the facts get in the way of a good narrative?

From a more practical perspective, if they're going to do this, ALL the iPlayer interfaces need a massive re-design. It is hopeless at surfacing content across all platforms. It's very good as a *catch-up* interface, but if you're going there looking for something to watch the way you would go to Netflix or YouTube, it's a mess.

It needs a much better search, all the landing pages need to showcase more content more efficiently and it needs a vastly more robust show subscription/watch list solution.

&gt;**Primer** is a 2004 American [science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) [drama film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_film) about the accidental discovery of a means of [time travel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel). The film was written, directed, and produced by [Shane Carruth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Carruth). Primer is of note for its extremely low budget (completed for $7,000), experimental plot structure, philosophical implications, and complex technical dialogue, which Carruth, a college graduate with a degree in mathematics and a former engineer, chose not to simplify for the sake of the audience.  The film collected the [Grand Jury Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sundance_Film_Festival_award_winners#2004) at the 2004 [Sundance Film Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival), before securing a limited release in the United States, and has since gained a [cult following](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following).

&gt;

&gt;The **bootstrap paradox**, or **ontological paradox**, is a [paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) of [time travel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) in which information or objects can exist without having been created. After information or an object is sent back in time, it is recovered in the present and becomes the very object or information that was initially brought back in time in the first place. Numerous [science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) stories are based on this paradox, which has also been the subject of serious physics articles. 

&gt;The term ""bootstrap paradox"" refers to the expression ""[pulling yourself up by your bootstraps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping)""; the use of the term for the time-travel paradox was popularized by [Robert A. Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein)'s story By His Bootstraps.

The players are waiting. Gerrard slowly marches on, the deafening roar of the Kop thunders throughout Merseyside. He glances over his shoulder; an ecstatic Brendan Rodgers is clapping his hands, shaking his head in delight. Eyes back up, and a wry smile creeps across his face as he watches his brothers up on that stand; a singing Lucas and Suarez with each others arms over their shoulders, Skrtel fist pumping whilst piggy-backing a resolute Agger, Toure watery eyed as a rush of nostalgia brings him to the verge of tears. But as Stevie nears the podium, he notices the rest of the players grinning directly at him. As his foot lands on the first step, Mignolet and Hendo laughingly jump out of the way, and to Gerrard's surprise, hiding behind the victors was none other than our legendary number 23.

Reina, Alonso, Garcia, and a host of past legends stand with the rest of Anfield, watching from the stands their final dream being completed before their very eyes. Gerrard reaches for the handle; he has waited too long to feel this silver which has eluded him for almost two decades. Carragher lets out a low chuckle as he holds the other handle, and promptly looks into his dear friends eyes.

true,rydleo,null,null,"The aggregate value of the three you mention is pretty low, perhaps £15M or thereabouts at most.  Reina and Assaidi have low book values, so anything made on them is mostly going to be upside, but Borini was bought for £11.7M on a 5 year contract, meaning his amortized value is 3/5 of £11.7M, or about £7M.  From a reporting perspective, if we sold him for £10M, we'd only report a gain of +£3M in other words.

In general, you are correct though in that player sales can be accretive to the club's finances in a very positive way to offset losses otherwise, at least for that year.  Unfortunately aside from Suarez and Sturridge, I don't think we have any other single players who would be likely to pull £20M plus into the coffers.  Clubs like Chelsea who can sell a Mata for £37M and hardly notice he is gone are very much at an advantage here and it is one of the reasons I believe they've embarked on the strategy of 'buy all the young players in world football and loan them'.  If they can do a De Bruyne or two every season it will help them massively financially moving forward to offset losses that otherwise might see them run afoul of FFP not to mention they get to keep the best of the lot which isn't a bad thing either.

Overall though I wouldn't worry too much about FFP for the upcoming CL/Europa season.  It's the one after that where we might have a bit of an issue. ",0,1394072178,null,0,false,0,cfvi7ys,t3_1zoby1,t1_cfvi7ys,t3_1zoby1,null,1432677285,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

This however is not the case, its not about persecuting those that already live here, its about controlling the flow of immigration. The UK is a hotspot for a lot of foreign nationals, mainly coming from Europe, due to our healthcare and benefits system. 

UKIP's main agenda is to control the rate at which we accept people coming into the country, with freeze policies and the removal of illegal immigrants (This isn't unusual in any other country). Our economy doesn't have the strength to carry this huge influx of people. While its true that a lot of immigrants bring valuable trades and skills, the large majority do not. All the other major parties have very little/no plans to curb this intake. 

The point is, to be racist, they would have to be excluding a specific nationality, race or peoples. The policies apply to everyone. Immigration is necessary to diversify, however, the existing populace should not be impacted. It would be like someone coming into your home and living there rent free. This obviously still doesn't apply to a lot of cases, but for the times it does you can't discriminate against one scenario and then allow another. It also removes the excuse 'All the foreigners, have taken our jobs', no more sitting at home complaining about it, when in fact the culprit is just lazy. 

Its not persecution, its maintaining what we already have, having open borders is living beyond our means.

The school DID NOT have a bullying problem.  EVER.  Say that again and you'll be expelled!  Do YOU understand me you little shit?!!?

The school are only to happy to phone the abuser if it's one of the parents and have them present.  This person will be sat right next to you... you know what'll happen if you dare say a word; you'll be sent home... to the tender mercies of your abuser.

The school is only too happy to believe the line ""Well you must of done something to deserve it"" and consider the matter dealt with. 

The school will send you to a counsellor because you're ""emotionally disturbed"" (no shit, a child being put through the sort of psychological torture outlawed by the Geneva Conventions might be ever so slightly fucked up).  This person has a large case load, deals with multiple schools and children.  They do not want to know what is really happening.  They want a quick and easy fix. 

Child Line will (or at least did when I called them) tell you to tell the school, if you refuse then it's tell your grandparents.  When you explain to them that a) the school's first action is to bring the abuser in and b) the only grandparents available are the parents of the abuser who consider that person to be the apple of their eye and never lies here is the response you'll get:  Sorry, we can't help you."" *click dialtone*.


Now I want you to understand this isn't the system failing.  That is the system in normal operation and every time bully is mentioned (usually because a kid snapped and either killed themselves or other people) you can clearly see that the system in the 80's is exactly the same as the system in 2014 with the singular exception that now, thanks to the internet and the ""Information Age"" a given child can burn through all available options in a week or so and intrinsically know: nobody is going to save you.  

And this system will never change because no school will ever admit it has a problem with bullying, drug abuse.  No parent will ever admit ""I might be abusive to my kid(s) and should get help.""  It's always going to be the childs problem.

So what did you want to discuss with regards to bullying?

Edit: -1 so you don't want to talk about bullying and how the systems deal with it.  Why even bother making the thread?",0,1394085688,null,0,1394092010,0,cfvnsjg,t3_1znd3f,t1_cfvnsjg,t3_1znd3f,null,1432679977,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It isn't just the Daily Mail readers though, you see the same attitude from people on Reddit, the various news networks and such.  It's very hard to escape the message that someone unemployed is a work shy scrounger. 

It's also hard to escape the message that if we put the boot in a little harder it will make these scroungers actually get a job.  Is that not what IDS has basically been saying, publicly, since he got his current position?

Combine that with a large percentage of the population (spread through all age ranges) who will intrinsically believe and trust what people who appear on TV say; because if they weren't reliable and trustworthy then they wouldn't be on TV (and that same circular logic applies to anyone they consider in a position of power) and...

Well you get a lot of people baying for blood in what some economists are calling ""The Great Recession"" and they've elected a government who'll deliver.  They don't actually care that schemes like Workfare will cost more than just paying the benefits themselves just so long as the people who are being blamed for all societies woes are punished.

3. Saints getting to a point where it seems unlikely that they'll progress any further - with all due respect I'd be very surprised if they seriously contend for a CL role. Once Lallana's fulfilled his ambitions of taking Saints as far as possible, he'd be more amenable to moving

&gt;

&gt;**Risperidone** (/rɨˈspɛərɨdoʊn/ ri-**SPAIR**-i-dohn) (trade name **Risperdal**, and generics) is an [atypical antipsychotic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic) drug which is mainly used to treat [schizophrenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) (including adolescent schizophrenia), [schizoaffective disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder), the mixed and manic states associated with [bipolar disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder), and irritability in people with [autism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism).

&gt;Risperidone belongs to the class of [atypical antipsychotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic).  It is a [dopamine antagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_antagonist) possessing [antiserotonergic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiserotonergic), [antiadrenergic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiadrenergic) and [antihistaminergic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihistaminergic) properties.

&gt;Side effects of risperidone might include significant [weight gain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain) and metabolic problems such as type 2 [diabetes mellitus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus),  as well as [tardive dyskinesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia) and [neuroleptic malignant syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome). Risperidone and other antipsychotics also increase the risk of death in patients with dementia.

When Andy Hornby detonated HBOS, and Lloyds bought it, Lloyds kept their registered office address as London, but maintained the head office as 'The Mount', the BoS\HBOS HQ.  I'm guessing there may be some 'tax relief' involved, since it seemed odd to me at the time that they didn't just move everything to centralise with Lloyds, since it was a takeover, not a merge.

Not sure if these articles are just scaremongering for personal gain of certain shareholders, though - since the HQ is already in London, surely Edinburgh could just be an 'offshore office'?

It's not about getting back what you put in, it's about supporting the wide range of things they do.

Let me be clear, I don't think they should cut it, but given the massive amount of money that needs saving it's probably the best option.

It's a well enough constructed story, but a mystery just isn't a mystery when you know whodunnit.

Other than that, I've been on a bit of a short story kick. I read [*The Penguin Book of English Short Stories*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2020316.The_Penguin_Book_of_English_Short_Stories), which, like any collection, had some hits and some misses, [*The Country of the Blind*](http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/3/) was a particular favourite. Check out the top review on Goodreads for a grand example of applying modern sensibilities to the past.

I also read Wilde's [*A House of Pomegranates*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2298136.A_House_of_Pomegranates); I vaguely remember reading a lot of his fairy stories as a child, and while I appreciate the structure and message much more now, some of the charm of the plot has been lost as I've got older, I think.

For novels, I finally got around to [*Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1127205.Attack_Of_The_Unsinkable_Rubber_Ducks), which was great. It has this semi-non-linear structure that was pulled off really well, it wasn't so overused as to become a gimmick, which is always a danger. The plot resolution was one of the couple of theories I came up with as I read, but it was well written enough that I kept up more than one until quite late in the day.

I've not really got a book I'm currently reading. Not finished *Ringworld*, but I'm also not really in the mood for it. I may pick up the next book in the Dresden Files, or go on with a few more short stories, I haven't decided yet.",0,1394093116,null,0,false,0,cfvpq17,t3_1zpc0r,t1_cfvpq17,t3_1zpc0r,null,1432680885,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

**EDIT:** Coincidentally I grew up in the TVP area, and was party to and a victim of abuse. On one occasion, and this was long before the internet. An incident made a couple of lines in the local news paper. The bucks free maybe. It wasn't much more than 140 characters. I was mortified it was vague and didnt really name names but I knew and so did the other kids they added 2 and 2 together &amp; ripped the piss hard!. So on top of abuse I had to deal with bullying as well. In this day and age shit goes round and round on twitter face book and in the play ground.

I just think the are better ways of raising awareness than distilling abuse and suffering in to 140 characters to provide some miss conceived fly on the wall up to the minute progress of the old bill on a shout. Bloody get orf twitter and do the policing!!

Yes there are things like cyber bullying and there are still kids who feel the need to bully those different from them, but I think this is kept to a much smaller minority. I could easily name the bullies of our school (around 10-20 in a school of 1200). 

Children are much more accepting than I remember - we have openly gay, lesbian and bisexual pupils and many aren't afraid to personalise their uniform to their own tastes and style their hair in interesting ways. 

I think that we have a much more varied celebrity culture now and that helps. Kids see film stars, musicians and TV personalities embracing their quirkiness and this gives them the courage to do so as well. 

Of course its not perfect. And there will always be unfortunate stories of children harming themselves due to bullying. Its the sad nature of children and poor parenting (of the bullies). But I think we making good steps towards a more accepting society.

Unfortunately by the time I worked this out I had become a target, and it took a while for this strategy to work. It's easier to avoid being a target in the first place than to stop being a target. 

""Punching the cunts"" rarely worked. The bullies couldn't be seen to be defeated by one of their targets, so they would call in reinforcements. There always seemed to be plenty of trainee thugs to call on. It turned out that a lot of them regularly got the shit beaten out of them by dad/big brother/mum's boyfriend,  so they weren't afraid of being on the receiving end of a good kicking. 

Names can be pretty painful. the key isn't that it doesn't hurt, it's that you don't show that it hurts. If you're bullying someone and don't get a reaction, you'll soon give up.

In later life we all meet bullies, and learning to deal with them is important. But we don't teach people to swim by throwing them into a swimming pool.

I was saying that calling both the John Lewis 15% and the controversial banking bonuses ""high bonuses"" is silly because they're not comparable. I bought up the cap since it is a simple way to illustrate the size of the bonuses we my be talking about in the banking sector.

Regarding sales commission. No, I don't support a cap, but then I'm not sure I support a cap on bankers either, though I do think saying that shareholders should have to vote if bonuses exceed 200% is reasonable.

A couple of difference: A salesperson's commission will usually be calculated exactly based on sales earned. A banking exec's calculation is often much more nebulous. Moreover, the risk inherent in the banking operation may well not become apparent for several years, which is why locking up bonuses as stock options may be better than dolling out cash every year.

The problem for the wider population is that usually, bank savings rates are higher than inflation, because banks need to attract savers to bring in money.

That isn't the case at the moment, as things like quantitative easing have made access to other funding cheaper for banks, meaning that they don't need to attract savers so much.

Because I'm doing pretty well, but you lot just keep letting the side down with outbursts of nuttiness.'

&gt; anecdote warning my high school economics teacher used to work in the Treasury, and said that the stress and complaints teachers have pale into insignificance compared to that.

He was comparing one particular teaching job with one particular Treasury job.  I imagine teaching in an inner city school that's in special measures and has poor leadership would be vastly more stressful than many Treasury jobs.  Also, I suspect most economics teachers teach A-level students (since economics isn't commonly taught before that age AFAIK), which does seem to be quite a lot less stressful than dealing with younger kids, especially since most of the more difficult ones don't end up doing A-levels.

This is also anecdotal, but as someone who has a lot of friends and relatives who are teachers, the most stressful situations seem to be Ofsted inspections, special measures, and working under poor headteachers.

* Worth knowing some chants if you fancy a sing song and don't know any (youtube them if you don't know them.. when the spurs go marching in is a popular one for example).
* There's a few ways to get to the ground but one way is to go to Seven Sisters train station and just follow the crowd (30 minute walk), that way there's also a spurs shop on the way selling merchandise. If you don't fancy the walk, White Hart Lane train station is a lot closer and you can get there on a train from Liverpool St.
More info here: http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/the-stadium/directions/
* The toilets are very busy at half time at a football game so you'll have to queue, the line for food is the same. Maybe worth going to the toilet and getting your food before kick off/leaving early at half time to make sure you get everything sorted.
* If you get a pint before the game at the stadium you're not allowed to bring it your seat with you, so leave yourself some time to drink it.
* Leave yourself some time to get there and soak in the atmosphere, or maybe go to a pub before if you fancy it (there will be bouncers on the door making sure you're a home fan/away fan, depending on if the pub is a home/away pub).
* Have fun!

I don't know, I've probably forgot some stuff. I don't get to games that often, 3 or 4 times a year maybe so I'm not exactly an expert, but I hope something there is in some way helpful.

&gt; If your commute is a pain, then coming back to a place you WANT to be (rather than is convenient) tips it for me.

Agreed. I was living in central Brighton in a studio flat for a while, but working a shit retail job in Worthing, so was about a 3 hour daily commute (thankfully only couple of days a week).

While the place I lived was kind of shit, and at first I hated everything about my life because I had nothing to come back to, as soon as I made friends locally being that central in Brighton really made it for me. 

I could have moved to Worthing - saved time and money, but I am certain that I would still be in that shit job today without the good life I have currently.

I used to live an hour away from where I worked, by public transport. The journey was horrible, especially after a  bad, long work day (10 hours) when you really wanted to get home and relax. But once home, it was easy to go out to relax/de-stress

The office moved and is now 40 mins walk from where I live, or a 15 min bus ride and 10 min walk. If I'm having a bad day, I get the bus and am home nice and easily, and can relax sooner. If I've had a good day, I can walk, enjoy the sunshine (if it's around) and chatter with colleagues and maybe call in at the local bar on the way. 

I had the opportunity of living closer to where I worked when the office was in the other town, but the other town was THE most boring anywhere - they had an Ikea and one Italian restaurant. No bars, no shops, nothing. 

Where I live is a lively town, with plenty to do, lots of restaurants and it's really nice to be able to leave work and go to a restaurant/bar/cinema in the evening.

2.) In Broadmoor, he was diagnosed as being a Paranoid Schizophrenic, which would in fact make the original basis of his claim during the trial valid; ergo, there is a possibility of rehabilitation.

I'm not opposed to life imprisonment, but I think dismissing the possibility out of hand in such cases is something of a double standard when we as a nation pride ourselves on being compassionate and believing in rehabilitation; we extend this courtesy to murderers, thieves and paedophiles all the time - Peter Sutcliffe, is in fact mentally ill - the fact that he is now medicated means that we as a society owe it to ourselves *as* a compassionate society to consider the possibility that he is in fact to a degree, rehabilitated.

Now...Whether that means a full release, or at least let back into the mainstream prison system is here nor there, but as someone living *with* mental illness, I find it frightening to think that if I've done something wrong and I'm not fully conscious of it, the law and society will hold me responsible for the rest of my life.",0,1394114236,null,0,false,0,cfvtj5j,t3_1zpc0r,t1_cfvtj5j,t1_cfvtd59,null,1432682680,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

That's typically why the amounts in those clauses are so high, too; the clubs are guarding against inflation, and future increase in value. So when Suarez was first bought from Ajax for 22.5 million, a release clause of 40 million guaranteed the club would make a profit of 17.5 million; two years into that, though, and that 40 million looks like a hell of a bargain for, say, Arsenal or Real Madrid, so when we renegotiated we probably tried for no release clause. Suarez (or, more likely, his agent), not wanting to be caught in a situation in two years where the club was floundering and not willing to sell their best player, wanted a clause inserted, so the new clause (from what I read somewhere) is something around 75 million, with certain conditions that must be met (I think it's not applicable to other BPL teams, and Liverpool can't have qualified for the Champions League, or something like that).

A 2011 Food Standards Ageny study found that non-stunned slaughter, even in Halal slaughter houses, is marginal at best, with 3% of cattle, 10% of sheep and goats and 4% of poultry going unstunned.

http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/board/fsa120508.pdf

RESULTS OF THE 2011 FSA ANIMAL WELFARE SURVEY IN GREAT BRITAIN

&gt;4.12 Non stun slaughter methods are subject to additional OV checks. These include specific checks on timings required by the law for religious slaughter, which are calculated based on throughput. Cattle restraint pens for non stun slaughter are subject to approval by Defra.

&gt;4.13 The FSA does not regularly collect data on the method of animal slaughter at an aggregated level. Detailed breakdown of specific slaughter processes and methods through the survey has allowed identification of the proportion of animals subject to slaughter by religious methods in that week.

&gt;4.14 A total of 43,772 cattle / calves were slaughtered at 194 establishments, of which:
o 1,314 (3%) were slaughtered by the Shechita (Jewish) method at 4 establishments, with 10% of these were stunned immediately after bleeding.
o 1,727 (4%) were slaughtered by the Halal (Muslim) method at 16 establishments. 84% of these were stunned before slaughter, and less than 1% stunned after bleeding.

&gt;4.15 A total of 307,512 sheep and goats were slaughtered at 202 establishments, of which:
o 1,917 (less than 1%) were slaughtered by the Shechita (Jewish) method (all not stunned) at 4 establishments
o 154,795 (50%) were slaughtered by the Halal (Muslim) method at 39 establishments. 81% of these were stunned before slaughter and less than 1% stunned after bleeding.
4.16 A total of 16,101,844 poultry were slaughtered at 73 establishments, of which:
o 71,236 (less than 1%) were slaughtered by the Shechita (Jewish) method (all not stunned) at 5 establishments
o 4,766,237 (30%) were slaughtered by the Halal (Muslim) method at 29 establishments. 88% of these were stunned before slaughter.

&gt;4.17 **The results indicate that the number of animals not stunned prior to slaughter is relatively low, accounting for 3% of cattle, 10% of sheep and goats and 4% of poultry. They also show that the majority of animals destined for the Halal trade in both the red and white meat sectors are stunned before slaughter.**

Or you've got an RSPCA factsheet ( http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232719611043&amp;mode=prd )with a reference to DIALREL paper based on information in 2007/2008: ""Assessment of the incidence and scale of religious slaughter practices"" which came to the conclusion that:

&gt;..74% of halal slaughter of cattle, 93% of halal slaughter of ruminants and 100% of halal slaughter of poultry in the UK involved pre-stunning.

While it is not entirely perfect, the idea that Halal slaughter as it is carried out in the UK is largely inhumane is wrong.

Also, this study from Cardiff university regarding the Halal Food Authority (which requires stunning) singled out in the article, albeit it focuses on slaughterhouses in wales (from circa P26 onwards):

http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cplan/sites/default/files/MM_Halal-Slaughter-Practices-Wales.pdf

&gt;**HFA’s reasons for accepting/allowing stunning in their standard for Halal slaughter lay in an increase of meat consumption, especially chicken meat, within the Muslim community, which can only be met by the large slaughterhouses that are designed with electric stun baths to increase the speed of production and to improve animal welfare. Thus the HFA’s message is: if meat consumption continues to increase and the price of meat is to remain affordable, ‘stunning to stun’ and not to kill will help to serve the Muslim community. Most importantly, animal welfare as well as human safety at slaughterhouse would be jeopardised if slaughter without stunning was performed for large-scale production.** HFA argues that kosher meat can be produced with slaughter without stunning because, contrary to Halal meat, it is produced in low quantities, manually even in the case of chickens, at low speed and high costs, supplying a small percentage of the population.1",0,1394116595,null,0,false,0,cfvuaqw,t3_1zprag,t1_cfvuaqw,t3_1zprag,null,1432683042,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"Okay.

When I was 14 years old (im 32 now) sitting in Biology Mr Holland said ""right since we've finished early do you want more work or a tale?""

A round of 'Tales!' got yelled back to him and so science bogged off for the last 20 minutes.

After thinking for a few minutes he asked the class 'Who likes custard creams?' and as it turned out pretty much the entire class did.

So Mr Holland then started to relate to us his time working at a biscuit factory with how hard the work was and the process of making the biscuits.  Then he goes ""Now  cream is nothing more than fat and sugar with some colouring that's all mixed up.  What you also need to remember is this was in the 70s when all this health and safety crap wasn't around so when I worked on making the cream we didn't have hair nets and coats etc. Christ it was hot in that factory too especially in summer with the ovens on so it wasn't uncommon to be sweating your balls off whilst making the cream so you'd end up sweating into the mixture."" 

By this point some where going ""oh god that gross"" and we are all looking at him with slightly disgusted yet fascinated looks on our faces. At this point you can tell he's finding our reactions hilarious so he started on again with this huge bloody grin on his face.

""Oh you should have seen what into that stuff. Hair, snot from people sneezing, fag ash, plasters - there was all sorts of crap falling in.""  

At this point there was some of us going ""I think I'm going to be actually sick"" and other remarks and of course we all went ""you're talking bollocks right Mr Holland?""

To switch he responded ""Nope, and worse people didn't always wash their hands after going to the toilet and that's not the worst of what has gone in. There's always accidents at factories and pests like mice especially back then but i'll leave that at that."" 

Of course that meant everyone's over active imagination supplied a cornucopia of body parts, rats, spiders, flies, birds, and bloody cockroaches falling into the mix as they get trapped in the machinery.

I turned to my mate and said ""I'm never eating a fucking custard cream again"" he responded with ""fuck just custard creams, if its got a filling im not eating it""

Mr Holland heard that and said ""Don't blame you, you should have seen what went got into the caramel!""

Thankfully he didn't manage to go onto the other biscuits because the headmaster was doing his rounds so Mr Holland cut it off with ""Aw shit here comes baldy"" and we had to pretend we where still working.

------------------------------------------

He was a good laugh Mr Holland, for open day that year we came in early and changed all the cupboard labels with things like ""extra large dildos"" and ""Anal lube"".  

After watching us all giggling for the first 15 minutes he went ""Ok, what the fuck've all done?"" until he spotted one of the labels and responded with ""Oh you fucking bastards!"" and ran around ripping off the labels before the first parents came in.",0,1394118045,null,0,false,0,cfvutol,t3_1zpfmj,t1_cfvutol,t1_cfvscg9,null,1432683357,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

I think that there was a deal made with the British public after WWII. That deal was the welfare state, including affordable housing. I think Thatcher broke that deal and the housing crisis that we now exist in is the consequence. 

Do I think that the people should be helped to live in places that they already live and have family in? Yes. 

The minimum wage has just gone up. By 15p. Nowhere near in line with inflation for the past 10 years. Cleaners still get paid minimum wage. Which means that in order to live anywhere near where they work, cleaners live in shitty conditions. Which strikes me as unfair. 

The VAST majority of people on benefits are ""decent"" people, whatever that means (and what does that mean? That they only break the same laws as everyone else? Or does it mean ""share the same middle class values as me""?). And I would much rather a few scumbags got away with it than people who genuinely needed help didn't. 

The implication of the Wayne and Waynetta references is that we don't want poor people who don't even buy organic, having children in our nice middle class areas. They might get in a fight with little Orlando. Fuck em off to the North where we can forget about them. It smacks of classism and it disgusts me.

And Townsend is far better than lennon - Lennon wouldnt start for the likes of Cardiff and Norwich - hes utter shit.

Townsend is a quality player and provided way more attacking wise than Lennon did vs cardiff. A lot of people on here including yourself it would seem have too poor an understanding of the game to see that.

Look at our goal, it came from Townsend breaking forward and then laying off a good ball to Adebayor keeping the fluidity of the attack going.
What did lennon do when he got into a similar position late in the game? He passes it straight to their centre-back.

This is embelematic of how bad Lennon is. He rarely provides much of  a threat going forward and is an incredibly limited player. The fact that lennon has been passed over time and time again for England call-ups would indicate how little he is rated by people in football.

true,probegt,flair8,,"I moved to London from NYC in Sept '06. My plan was to familiarize myself in advance with some of the clubs and players, and then watch the PL for the first half season and let the team choice come to me. Was more interested in watching individual players at that time and letting that shape the team decision; for example i was impressed by Drogba's skills but hated his diving antics and how he spent more time on his ass crying than on his feet working, so that canceled out Chelsea...Ronaldo was amazing, so I'd make sure to watch him more.

Incidentally around that time Bill Simmons from ESPN [wrote an article](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060719) detailing his thought process on how he'd decide who he'd follow, which was interestingly written and which I took into account (he picked Spurs). 

I had some rough guidelines on what team I would select:  would preferably be a local London team, though i wouldn't completely cancel out folks like Liverpool or whatnot, and I didn't want to bandwagon too much, e.g. Man U and Chelsea were out.  My closest friends at work were a mix of Tottenham, West Ham, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest supporters, so their feedback was an influence as well. I also tried to visit as many grounds as I could to get a feel for the atmosphere and the experience.

West Ham was something I found myself trying to get into, simply because as a East London resident (was out by the Wharf) they felt like the local team (tho Charlton was out there too, but I didn't want to do that to myself. Also, I didn't want to pick a lower league side and didn't want to catch too many beatings so I canceled out Millwall). Ultimately it was Spurs who caught my attention the most, cause they were simply exciting to watch. Berbatov played a big role in that. Keane and Lennon too, and towards the last quarter of the season I was devoted to watching them every game I could.

So by the start of the '07-'08 season I was solidly a Spurs supporter. A season which then introduced me to the turmoil of being a Spurs fan. It's been a wild ride ever since. Moved back to NYC after the '09 season, and the PL has stayed my most watched sport back home as well.",0,1394121052,null,0,false,0,cfvw0z9,t3_1zl103,t1_cfvw0z9,t3_1zl103,null,1432683923,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised police to charge Max Clifford with 11 indecent assaults allegedly committed between 1966 and 1985. Alison Saunders, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London, said:

“We have carefully considered the evidence gathered as part of Operation Yewtree in relation to Max Clifford, who was initially arrested on 6 December 2012 over allegations of sexual offences.

“Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Clifford to be charged with 11 offences of indecent assault relating to seven complainants. The charges are:

One offence of indecent assault relating to a girl, aged 14, in 1966

One offence of indecent assault relating to a woman, aged 18, in 1974/75

Three offences of indecent assault relating to a girl, aged 15, in 1977/78

One offence of indecent assault relating to a woman, aged 19, in 1978

Two offences of indecent assault relating to a girl, aged 16 or 17, in 1981/82

One offence of indecent assault relating to a woman, aged 19, in 1980/81

Two offences of indecent assault relating to a woman, aged 18, in 1984/85

“Mr Clifford will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 28 May 2013.

“We have also decided that there is insufficient evidence to authorise charges in relation to three separate allegations. These decisions were taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and our guidance for prosecutors on sexual offences.

""May I remind all concerned that Mr Clifford has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.”

Additional information

To allow journalists to track progress, it may be helpful to know that until this point the CPS has described the file relating to Max Clifford in the following terms: “a man in his 60s from Surrey arrested on 6 December 2012 in relation to possible offences of a sexual nature.”

Ok, let me stop you there.

I need to dispel this myth that teachers get 6 weeks off every summer.

It's just not true.

My partner is a teacher and she gets at the most 2 weeks off at summer and that's if the college she works at aren't running summer schools or refresher courses for mature students etc. During other holidays she gets one or two days off and then has to be in work either marking or lesson planning or doing the work she couldn't do during term time because she is that busy. They have a set number of holiday days, just like people in ""regular"" employment do and cannot just take 6 weeks off in summer or 2 at Easter, it *does not* work like that.

&gt; just getting a week or two off a couple of times a year isn't enough to totally recharge the same way you can after the summer break.

There is no recharging. It's just like me or you or anyone else taking 2 weeks holiday to go away in summer. It's arrive back on Sunday, back to work Monday.

It's a somewhat similar plot thread to NOTW, but is much more humourous and lighthearted in tone (most of the time). The First book in the series of seven (three released so far) is **The Lies of Locke Lamora**, and is a damn good read. 

Speaking of which, I've just finished the latest in the series, *The Republic of Thieves*. WHilst still as well written, hilarious, witty, etc. etc. as the previous two, it just didn't seem to flow as well, plot wise. The ending was a tad confusing and muddled, so I might have to re-read it to make things a bit clearer.

true,JetSetWilly,null,null,"Actually I think the teacher's union is kind of a problem for teachers as well. It is hard to fire teachers and that is not a good thing for teachers either. If you talk to teachers they will all moan about terribly bad teachers they know who despite being amazingly incompetent, remain employed. 

Now, the teacher I know who works extra time is in the situation where she is not permanent. In fact most schools are highly reluctant to hire teachers on a full time basis, so the usage of semi-permanent, part-time or supply teachers is very high - at least here in Scotland. 

What do you think happens if you say to your boss, ""I don't want to work this extra time period, it is supposed to be protected development time""? What happens is, you put yourself at risk of suddenly getting a lot less hours, or not getting that permanent job if it finally comes up, or gaining a reputation as a trouble-maker.

So actually, I think you would be quite surprised at the creative accounting that goes on around working hours and regulations. most teachers are not in fact hardcore bolsheviks ready to strike at a moment's notice, and can and are taken advantage of. And a timetable is only a small part of the work - lessons don't prepare themselves. The bureaucracy and referring-to-social-services and marking doesn't magically happen. A lot of it happens at home (unpaid and off the record).

I believe the unions can be counterproductive to teachers and that most teachers don't even like the unions in many respects, but are not in a position where they can do anything about it. But clearly they need to have some sort of union. If my job offers me a 1% pay rise, oh well, I'll get a job somewhere else that pays more. You don't have that option if your only potential employer in your career is the state - so both sides need to have some kind of collective bargaining power.",0,1394128330,null,0,false,0,cfvzcxo,t3_1zpfmj,t1_cfvzcxo,t1_cfvyzj8,null,1432685493,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This has always been the core of the Barca model. Kids come through La Masia and they are pushed pretty young into the first team. It is the reason why there have been poorer patches of Barca's history, but also times when they are bringing through the best in the world regularly. 

At Real Madrid, yea- he wouldn't have a chance, but he is pretty much perfect for breaking into the Barca squad. You can't tell me players like Sergi Roberto, Cristian Tello (at least 2 years ago) are really any better than Deulofeu, and they have seen plenty of minutes, due to Barca's homegrown development policies.

Arranged interviews with Martin Bashir for the 5 men accused of killing Stephen Lawrence, two of which have since been found guilty.

His whole wealth is based on him covering up celebrities' scandals by manipulating the media.

Believed to be behind the false rape allegations against Neil &amp; Christine Hamilton , he had to pay them damages for libel.

The episode of Louis Theroux meets Max Clifford shows his real character, worth looking for the episode on line, quite revealing.

Represents twats Like Gillian McKeith, Rebecca Loos &amp; Pamela Bordes.


But in his defence he did fuck up lying politicians on regular basis by revealing the extra marital affairs  of Prescott, David Mellor, &amp; helping expose Jefferey Archer commiting perjury when he was running for London Mayor. I'd say the motivation was his own wallet rather than helping the country.

Some do know how to write a CV - I'd be lying if I claimed otherwise. 

*However* a surprising number of them do not know to include vital information about their education or background - even 1st class graduates of Computer Science who don't expand on what their University modules covered and what skills they actually picked up. 

Plenty have spelling mistakes - though this continues right up to adult / senior management level. 

...and a healthy number are simply poorly laid out or confusing, messy, ugly to the eye. People seem to forget that this is a snapshot of who they are and on the strength of it they will or will not get a job. Amongst graduates in particular this crops up - I often have to amend details with their consent or format the CV to be easier on the eye. 

(Point being that all of this should be taught at GCSE/A-Level to a basic level. Just one or two modules in English classes titled 'this is what your CV **must** contain' would make a world of difference.) 

With regards to dress and behavior... we've had people show up to interviews in tracksuits and (on one memorable occasion) someone even relieved themselves in the car park of the offices they were applying to work at - because they were running late and didn't want to ask for the toilet when they got into the building(!) - then there's those who forget to turn their phone off or are otherwise unprepared. 

We wind up having to babysit because grown adults don't realize these things for themselves. 

So I hate to say it, but I really strongly feel that schools should be the place where these basic skills are introduced. A few hours on the basics of getting a job and what you *must* do and how you *must* present yourself might mean the difference!

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not the OP &amp; IANAL - but let me draw a similarity which has already been tested. Let me focus purely on the legal aspect here, nevermind the changing social attitudes which are a different kettle of fish.

A story ran [in England about the couple who owned a B&amp;B](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25119158), who expressly didn't allow gay people to stay in the hotel. 

The fact they own the property isn't what they were selling - they sold the service of a room, and breakfast. The colour of money isn't different between people regardless of sexuality. Because they were making a public offer of a service in exchange for money, they have to abide by the law. The couple in the article drew a line in the sand (""No Gays""), and it broke the law. Regardless of what your personal beliefs are, it broke the law.

Not too dissimilar is the story of our taxi driver. He's offering a service with his car (getting you to the pub.) But because he's willing to take money for the service, but _potentially¹_ discriminate on the grounds of sexuality - he's breaking the law.

You might turn round and say ""What if I'm lashed at the bar and get refused another drink. Am I 'discriminated' against because I was drunk?"" and the answer is simply, No. Why? It's not illegal for a bartender to refuse you service for being drunk.

It's [enshrined by law](https://www.gov.uk/equality-act-2010-guidance)² that it is illegal to discriminate by many things, and one of those is sexuality. If you're willing to publicly sell a service in exchange for money, you can't discriminate. 

That is why it is unreasonable for a taxi man to discriminate on who he's picked up as a fare, and that's why it's a problem that he ejected them from the car.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Tell me, please, preferably using more than a single sentence, why are multi-well pads a bad thing?

They evolved because of the geology and the distribution of the gas.  Conventionally, you find a likely site, drill a well down to your oil/gas, and then move some considerable distance away and try the same thing again.  With multi-well pads, you're putting wells down everywhere, saturating the land with them at a very high density to get at gas which is widely and, broadly speaking, equally dispersed under the ground.  This means longer term, heavy industrialisation of larger areas which are being fracked unconventionally, with all the associated noise and air pollution (including methane which is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas), as well as masses of materials being hauled in and huge quantities of sometimes hazardous waste products being hauled out.  

It also inevitably means greater risk as a result of how things are scaled up.  How many wells do you imagine will be drilled across the UK if the proposed target of 60% of UK's land is reached?  What is the cumulative probability of a significant ecological or public health and safety disaster with that many, even if the individual risks are small?

Independant:  ""One Whitehall source""  ""Whitehall insiders said Mrs May had been advised"" ""One source said the Home Office now looked “pretty isolated"".  When you see these kinds of things without a solid reference it's normally the paper's opinion hence the lack of proof.


Telegraph: ""evidence for some labour market displacement in recent years when the economy was in recession"".  It quoted the report directly. It also includes the counter argument ""However, the report also makes several points that may support the arguments of those who say immigration is not harmful and may have economic benefits"".


One factor in this article is the independant article is from before the report was published so we should excuse them for not quoting directly.


The telegraph does present both arguments, then analyses, them finishes with a disclaimer that the effects may take several generations to play out.

I'm not sure what part you think is BS but no, it's not. Deontological systems of ethics, at least of the various versions I've spent time on, do not consider forcing others to act in a certain way to be moral.

&gt;But this is irrelevant. You can discuss how ethically superior you are all you want, but all it really comes down to is that I'd rather live in a world where we try to fight bigotry rather than one where we accept it as someone's personal right.

*""You're right but I don't care""* - gotit. I know that's how this society will be run, I know that Brits by and large don't much care about liberty so long as they're comfortable and safe and no-one is hurting their sensibilities. I get that. Calling laws against bigotry ""fighting"" it is like calling executing someone winning a game of chess though. You're not fighting it, you're banning it.

It's an easy, inelegant, and as I've argued fundamentally immoral solution to a problem we don't like, and what really makes it so bad is that the only reason people who believe like you and I do that discrimination along lines of colour/race/etc. can ban it, is because we happen to be the majority, and that 50 or 100 years ago the people who hated, say, homosexuality, were able to keep it illegal precisely because they happened to be the majority. It's the use of brute force to prescribe morality as we see fit, and just because I happen to think that it's good not to be a racist homophobe, doesn't mean I want to use the tools previously used by racist homophobes just because I happen now to outnumber them.

Ultimately, it sets a precedent that this method of achieving the society we seek is OK, that we don't need to win the intellectual and moral argument, we can just ban things we don't like. I think this is pretty obviously a negative trend to keep going, and that it could quite possibly backfire at some point, but even if it never did (which seems inevitable), it still seems like a faulty way of attaining the society we desire.",0,1394133565,null,0,1394133775,0,cfw1v96,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfw1v96,t1_cfw1mg4,null,1432686674,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But you're justifying a system where people would be forced to shop/live/work elsewhere due to 'freedom to discriminate'.

&gt;""You're right but I don't care""

Uh, I didn't say you were right. I said you can discuss ethical systems as much as you want, but the fact is is that none of them are 'true' or 'right', because morality is subjective.

As for your mad rant, okay pal. If you think racism is moral, or good, or 'elegant', then you're really not worth my time. Please feel free to spin this into me being intellectually checkmated by you, but we both know the simple truth of the matter is that you're saying pre civil rights era america was just hunky dory, which is in opposition to all history we have on the subject.

&gt;can ban it, is because we happen to be the majority

That's not true. People in my country don't really care about transgender people like me. Democracy has to have laws that protect transgender people even though the majority doesn't want that to happen. We must have a system where those who are weak are protected from the strong. Your method of allowing people to discriminate truly does consist of majority rule, and would mean that I personally would not be protected and probably rejected from most businesses. And when it comes down to it, most people wouldn't give a damn. At that point you'd tell me to campaign, start a movement and educate people, but I fail to see why I should have to educate people that I'm a human being. The truth of the matter is that the government needs to protect those who cannot protect themselves. That's all there is to it.

&gt;It's the use of brute force to prescribe morality as we see fit, and just because I happen to think that it's good not to be a racist homophobe, doesn't mean I want to use the tools previously used by racist homophobes just because I happen now to outnumber them.

Do you think I actually do, given all I've said against it?

&gt;You're saying pre civil rights era america was just hunky dory

No I'm not, and you either know it or you're not reading with much attention.

&gt;That's not true. People in my country don't really care about transgender people like me. Democracy has to have laws that protect transgender people even though the majority doesn't want that to happen.

It will only happen *because* the minority wants it to happen, if you live in a democracy. If the majority want XY or Z banned strongly enough then it gets banned, if they want it legal, it's legal. I agree there's certainly a lag for transgender people compared with LGB laws, but they'll no doubt come in a similar way.

&gt;Your method of allowing people to discriminate truly does consist of majority rule, and would mean that I personally would not be protected and probably rejected from most businesses.

It's not majority rule at all, it's individual choice. How on earth can you think allowing people to make a choice as an individual is more ""majority rule"" than democratically elected ministers who represent the majority of the electorate simply banning something?

&gt;The truth of the matter is that the government needs to protect those who cannot protect themselves. That's all there is to it.

That acts as if being rejected from a business is an attack on your person from which you need to be ""protected"", but rejection is not an act, it's a failure to act.

I don't, but I do have a moral right not to be judged because of the color of my skin, sexuality, gender etc. They can refuse to serve me if I'm being rowdy or abusive or unpleasant. I thought you libertarians believed that everyone should have equal opportunities?

&gt;Do you think I actually do, given all I've said against it?

If you don't think its okay, you think its acceptable.

&gt;It will only happen because the minority wants it to happen, if you live in a democracy. If the majority want XY or Z banned strongly enough then it gets banned, if they want it legal, it's legal. 

That god we don't have majority rule, then.

&gt;I agree there's certainly a lag for transgender people compared with LGB laws, but they'll no doubt come in a similar way.

There's no way to ensure that, and it certainly won't if bigotry is made legal.

&gt;It's not majority rule at all, it's individual choice. How on earth can you think allowing people to make a choice as an individual is more ""majority rule"" than democratically elected ministers who represent the majority of the electorate simply banning something?

That comes down to majority rule when the majority is against a certain group. What do you think maintained pre-civil rights era america? Lots of people making an individual choice against black people comes down to oppression.

&gt;That acts as if being rejected from a business is an attack on your person from which you need to be ""protected"", but rejection is not an act, it's a failure to act.

Being unable to buy houses, healthcare, shop at local stores, buy clothes and get employment is an attack on a person, yes. And thats what pre-civil rights era america was like. You're saying that was right, and that it would have solved itself, when it wouldn't. The free market wasn't going to fix that, we had to force people to see each other as human beings.

&gt;No quite clearly one regards a non-physical act and the others a phsyical act, but prescribing morality which doesn't impact upon the freedom of others via the law is the same in principle, regardless of what morality that is you're prescribing. As I said, it's the same blunt tools, just a different aim.

Laws against stalking constitute a non-physical act, but we agree that stalking is genuinely harmful psychologically. Being the victim of discrimination/hate speech also creates incredibly psychological harm.

I assumed Libertarians believed that being seen as a human being, being given equal opportunities was part of the entire philosophy, but now I see that you guys don't really care if people are bigoted and think their right to refuse opportunities to people they don't approve of should be protected. It is the government's job to protect those who are too weak to protect themselves. I'm guessing you're a white straight guy who has never been in a position where you need protection in that way (though I doubt you'll admit it since you know it detracts from your argument), but you should really try to open your ears to the people who need that protection, and would be affected by your legislated bigotry. It isn't as simple as the mom and pop store refusing to serve certain people. Ultimately it comes down to largescale bigotry that ends up being protected by people like you as 'their right to be a bigot'.",0,1394136388,null,0,false,0,cfw38pb,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfw38pb,t1_cfw2e4p,null,1432687399,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,LikesToCorrectThings,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Indeed.  In fact, giving it some more thought, these kinds of hoops that we inflict on those in need of our help actually make it more interesting for the fraudsters.

If you're genuinely disabled, the invitation to prove, once again, that your birth defect or terminal illness hasn't miraculously cured itself, and still causes you bother, must come as a blow.  Then you have the logistics; you need to arrange the visit to the doctors.  Maybe your disability means you need some help getting there, so a friend or relative has to take a day off work to help you.  Or maybe you have to pay for a taxi out of your already low income.  Then you have to sit there while someone pokes and prods you and confirms that yes, legs don't grow back, blindness doesn't spontaneously cure itself, and bureaucracy doesn't cure cancer.  It must surely be a traumatic experience.

What's worse about this is that most people with disabilities that I know don't like to let their disability get in the way, so when asked the government's over-simplistic questions like ""can you lift something over your head"", they might answer ""yes"" even though it takes every ounce of their effort to get it even half-way, because ""damnit, I'm not letting this get the better of me!""

But, flipping it around, if you *are* deliberately defrauding society, suddenly the whole thing becomes a challenge.  You relish the opportunity to get one over on everyone else.  You gladly take medical leave from your job, if you even bother to have one, to jump in your taxpayer-subsidised car and drive yourself to the hospital.  It's no bother to you because you're *not actually disabled*.  Then when the doctor asks you questions, you fake it, and answer them in the most pathetic way possible: ""no I couldn't possibly lift anything over my head, it just *hurts too much*"".  Your pride's not on the line, because guess what?  You're acting.

I'm told a lot that I come across super confident, well spoken and extroverted and I might share a few laughs with that person but neither of us makes future plans and then I just sort of...never see them again.

I read it and it was a bit disappointing, just one battle after another with very little in the way of plot or characterisation. I wasn't expecting the novel to be a great work of literature, but I was hoping to get a decent story out of it at least. 

However, I noticed that the novel specifically came from a ""battles"" subseries and it occurs to me that I may have picked the wrong one up.

Meanwhile, 'Dell double charges customer and refuses to issue refund' can be flipped around to 'Customer double charged and declined refund', and the victim/aggressor relationship remains intact.
