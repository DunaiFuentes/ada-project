Rose: You gave him a 3/10. I think that's ridiculous. I'm all for buying a LB in the summer (I would absolutely love to land Rodriguez), but Rose is not a 3/10. 3/10 is like a solidly below average starter. Rose is just average. I'd put him as a 5/10. 

Sandro: You gave him an 8/10. Nonsense. Sandro was the best DM in the Prem before he got hurt last year. 10/10, no question.

Dembele: You gave him a 7/10. I would give him an 8. If it wasn't for his lack of ability to pick a final pass, he'd be a 9. He's arguably the best midfield dribbler in the Prem and is incredibly hard to knock off the ball. Just look at yesterday to see what he can do when he's in form. I just think a 7 is a notch too low.

Lennon: You gave a 4/10. I think he's been poor lately, but he still has more to offer than a 4. I would put him as a 5.5/10. He keeps width really well and can run at defenders. He lacks any semblance of an end product, which is why I'd keep him as a 5.5 and not higher.

Adebayor: 4/10. No shot. When he's on his game, he's one of the better strikers in the league. I honestly think his attitude problems get overblown. I think it should be clear now that his poor play last year may have been partially his fault, but it was also the result of AVB's shit tactics. Anything below a 7/10 is crazy.

In my mind he still deserves a new contract, or the contract extension option, even if he doesn't reach CL.

He was given a 3-year remit to reach the CL, and right now he's ahead of schedule despite not receiving the reinforcements to the playing squad he expected (and justifiably deserved; he's wanted a marquee attacking signing for the past two windows, and instead he's got Victor Moses on loan from Chelsea). That's before you consider how many players have improved under his watch - how many other clubs have managed to improve their existing players as dramatically as Rodgers has?

Firstly, *football* is still in it's adolescent stage in regards to popularity in the States and it's  not mind blowing that new fans will be attracted to the already prominent teams. This happens for a variety of reason but is so blatantly obvious that I don't think more needs to be said about it. 

What upsets me is the propagation of this idea that all Americans are, to use your terminology, *glory supporters*. Even if that were the case would it be so shocking?
The United States is about six times the population of England with a land area that is approximately 75 times larger. Oh and like three thousand miles of ocean in between. Part of the appeal of English football is the large number of teams in close proximity to each other which allows rivalries to blossom. Talking specifically about English football, I imagine that most local supporters are simply born into their fandom and experience these intense rivalries from a young age. Clearly this type of imprinting is much more rare when you never get a chance to watch a game in person. As a result, we have fans whose allegiance has been determined in a wide variety of ways.

So fine, there is some small fraction of the population that are not true fans and we, as smart individuals, are able to understand how this could happen. You take things a step farther when you start talking about sports rooted in OUR culture and continue to misrepresent the facts. We are a sporting nation. We have die-hard fans of all shapes and sizes. Just because in your personal life you know a couple people who have switched allegiance doesn't mean we need to label the entire country. Americans get a bad rap for all sorts of shit internationally and it's not going away anytime soon. Is it too much to ask for one of our own to say something positive?. We all know there is a large foreign interest on this sub as confirmed by our recent poll and I'm getting tired of this idiot American vibe going around.

I apologize if this comes off as a personal attack towards you. I just want people to know the large majority of us are in fact true fans.

&gt; But he shouldn't get a new contract before he gets Champions League in my eyes.

Why not? We're progressing in the right direction under him. Barring a horrendous collapse in these last 13 games, we'll have undoubtedly made significant progress over the past 2 seasons regardless of our final league position. And that despite being undermined in the transfer market both last summer and this summer/winter. Any new manager would not be likely to pick up immediately where Rodgers left off, and we would be consigning ourselves to another 'transition season' like last season. 

&gt; And we should get a Director of Football. One that can work with the manager. Really, that shouldn't be that hard?

And yet, it is. AVB's suggested he wasn't entirely pleased with Baldini's work - and the Bale money could certainly have been better spent - Sunderland sacked De Fanti, Cardiff's owner accused Iain Moody of overspending and sacked him, and Kinnear doesn't deserve a mention. The only big team that is successfully using a DoF in the PL right now is Man City, and theirs used to work at fucking Barca - sporting directors of that calibre aren't a dime a dozen.

Also, as we saw with Comolli, entrusting the entire player identification and negotiation process to one individual is too much power for one person. The committee system can work - and the calibre of player we've been after has been the right one. We absolutely *should* be going for players like Mkhitaryan, Costa, Willian, Salah and Konoplyanka.

1. You'll definitely be waiting a while. Maybe not HOURS, but probably at least one. I had to wait that long to see Freema Agyeman last year. The way signings work is that you get to the front of the autograph line (the previously mentioned hour), pay the fee (yeah, fees suck, but most of the actors require them), and get something signed. If you don't have anything, there are usually pictures of the actors up front that come with the autograph fee. If you don't want to pay the fee (I didn't) you can just say hello to the actors (not really worth the wait, IMO, and I only did it because I was with a sad friend who wanted to see Freema to make her feel better). Alternatively, you can pay and take personal pictures with the actor/actress of your choice (provided that he/she is doing them) and get THOSE signed.

2. No idea, I missed it last year. Sorry. On costumes, though, just wear whatever you want to. As a Captain Sexy Harkness cosplayer myself, I recommend Jack, but you can do whatever you like.

3. How deeply friendly everyone there was. I ended up going alone because I was the only one out of my group of friends to get a ticket and was worried that I'd be wandering around alone. I ended up having a wonderful time (hence going this year) and made friends that I'll be rooming with this time around.

4. No opinion, really. I just had fun being there and didn't do a ton of specific events that would mean a lot to everyone else.

5. As many or as little as you like. Some people don't go in costume at all, and some people wear different ones every day. I'm just going to be Jack the whole time, sometimes with the coat, sometimes without it, but never really changing anything about my cosplay. A friend that I met there, alternatively, has several different Captain Jack Harkness costumes (ranging from first meeting with the hat to Satellite 5 lots of leather to Torchwood-era) that he rotates throughout the event.


The important thing is to just show up and have fun. I'm sorry that I missed your post a month ago, and if you've already got all of this advice from other sources, then I'm sorry for typing so much stuff.

&gt;Sectarian attacks and alleged ethnic cleansing
The IRA carried out sectarian attacks. Sutton attributes 130 sectarian killings of Protestants to the IRA. The IRA often denied being involved in such attacks and sometimes used cover names for such attacks. For example using the cover name the South Armagh Republican Action Force, the IRA killed six Protestants at Tullyvallen. Some in the IRA were unhappy with it carrying out sectarian attacks, but others considered them effective in preventing sectarian attacks on Catholics, as for example in justfiying the Kingsmill massacre of ten Protestants.
A former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service has accused the IRA’s campaign in some border areas of amounting to “ethnic cleansing”. Sir Kenneth Bloomfield was speaking at the launch of Professor Henry Patterson’s book which claims that in County Fermanagh the Protestant minority there believed they were being ethnically cleansed by the PIRA, although this is a contested allegation.

On the other hand, the 10th Doctor did not want to regenerate quite yet because he loved being that Doctor.

 We all give each other shit during the week over messages or when we meet up, every Saturday night we hang out at one of our houses, play fifa until the games start and watch whichever one of our teams is playing. Can't really do it on Sunday/Tuesday/Monday nights since the games are middle of the night and we have work the next day. But we defend our clubs as if it's our baby. Read all the articles during the week, watch press conferences and other videos about players, record midweek matches, watch the highlights and try to catch glimpses of loaned players through this subreddit. Have a lot of scarves, jerseys, random memorabilia, posters. 

I work with a lot of english people who grew up in England supporting Everton, Liverpool, Norwich, Leeds, Southampton and a few others. They tell me stories of how it was growing up in England and actually going to the games, how the culture is etc. and I feel so jealous haha

I do support my local club (Western Sydney Wanderers) they only came in to the A-league last season but I'm a season holder this season and only missed the first 5 home matches of last season. Went to one game and I was hooked.We go to the game about 2-3 hours before the match, have a feed, few beers then join in the march through one of the main streets singing and chanting to the stadium. It feels great so far, hopefully be able to go to England to watch a game live just to see how it is live compared to the tv.

Highlight for me has been seeing Gallas play live. Wasn't anything extraordinary but just seeing a former Chelsea player playing in my backyard after all those years watching him through a 42 inch plasma was pretty cool. There are a few Chelsea supporters who sit near me born in England and they were cheering him on even though he was playing against us.

Also there's a few local events like [Refresh Belfast](http://refreshbelfast.com/) that are quite popular and a great way to meet other people in the industry.

As for all Americans being glory supporters, I never said that.

Glory supporters exist all over the world, not just in America, and yes we are a sporting nation, but that doesn't absolve many of us of only chiming in on sports when our team is winning. I'm not really very fussed about what people think of us as Americans because in my opinion most people have made up their minds already and they either love us or hate us. 

I spend a lot of time in other countries (England in particular because my wife is English) and I catch shit constantly for supporting Chelsea, especially over there. I get called a glory supporter. I am told I don't know what I'm talking about. I get grilled by even our own supporters in England because I somehow should prove that I know about Chelsea when I could answer questions that your average English supporter doesn't know about our team. I've put up with a lot and I never complain. 

I love Chelsea, end of story. I am happy when they win and sad when they lose. I wear the kit every single day they play, and watch as many games as my time allows.

I think next year is going to be the toughest year in terms of proving that we can bring these players home and fit them into the system. If we can't get one of Lukaku or Courtois into the first team next season I think we've got to have some serious doubts about the viability of this plan. 

The obvious counter to this point is that: ""if they don't fit the system or aren't good enough to make the team then they shouldn't play."" And while that point is totally correct, that still doesn't resolve the question of if two of our brightest prospects couldn't make it, what chances do some of these other guys have?

I think looking at your lineup, if in five years we still had Courtois, Lukaku, Piazon, and Chalobah playing for us, I would label this program a huge success.

I'm not sure about Lukaku. Much like Courtois, he can't come back expecting to be given the starting spot for nothing. Mata and KDB weren't willing or able to adapt to what Jose wanted and they're gone now. I suspect that if Lukaku doesn't want to play Mourinho's way, he'll be sold.

We needed pace on the wings with Traore and Hoillett. Kranjkar is our creativity, so must sit behind the striker.

I know a couple of other Blues fan, a City fan, a Villa fan, a Nottingham fan, a couple of Arsenal fans, a Real Fan, and way too many Barca and ManUtd fans. There are a few glory hunters, but the crowd I run with are generally well informed and have been playing themselves forever. It's fun to take jabs at each other, and while it can get a bit serious (people not talking to each other for a few days) it's generally fun spirited.  Luckily, these guys know their shit , so we can have intelligent discussions about things, despite our team preferences. We all also try to support the LA Galaxy and go to games fairly often, so we try to keep up locally, but honestly Chelsea is way more exciting and I consider myself a bigger Blues fan than a Galaxy fan.  I think a reason why many Americans don't quite understand the rivalries is because they don't realize how geographically these teams are clustered together and how for some English fans, these teams represent their home parish or socio-economic status. There are plenty of heated sports rivalries in the US, but none are really geographically that close to imitate anything in England. The closest thing I can think of is in college sports locally between UCLA and USC, especially since I've lived this rivalry most of my life and am a UCLA alum(Go Bruins!). Anyways, being a Blues fan is awesome in the States because there aren't a ton of us around, so meeting another Chelsea fan is always exciting. I've been repping the team for like 8 years now, fell in love with the team after learning about Drogba. I had always played and casually watched and followed, but Drogba caused me to start following the team. It was great having something to follow between football and basketball and beyond. I own a ton of jerseys, have a Chels flag up and have become more hardcore over the years.  Soccer is such an international sport, I find it silly people get angry over foreign fans. If you can let foreigners play for your team, you can let them be fans too. I get that we may not have as deep or inherent attachment to the team, but I can assure you that while I may be not British, I do indeed bleed blue.

&gt;Header: Liverpool's inconsistency explained

Explained! So you have the answer all along! Presumptuous beyond belief. 

&gt;It appears to be a pattern with Liverpool this year.  

What appears to be a pattern? What kind of opening is this? 

&gt;As a major fan I have watched every game this season and have noticed Liverpool play down to their opponents.

Are you saying only major fans watch every game? Is this some sort of accomplishment? What if someone missed a match? They aren't major fans anymore? 

&gt; but you can't win em all

but you can't win 'em all. 

&gt;I do notice however, Liverpool tend to come out every once in a while and just absolutely play their hearts out and abolish their opponent

Grammar and sentence structure. Nobody cares if you noticed it or not, this isn't some major observation. 

&gt;Why can't Liverpool play like this every game? I have no idea


So you are here to explain consistency, but you have no idea why Liverpool can't play like this every game? 

&gt;for sure Brendan Rodgers is not to blame for our occasional top quality play

What are you trying to say? He shouldn't take credit for good play? Are you trying to say ""Brendan Rodgers is not to blame for our poor performances on occasion""?

&gt;We have the star power up top of course with the Golden Boot leader Luis Suarez and the very much in form Daniel Sturridge, with Phillipe Coutinho and speedy Raheem Sterling behind them.

Premier League top scorer, not Golden Boot leader. By the way, Suarez is Golden Boot leader, Sturridge is 'very much in form' and Sterling is 'speedy'. Coutinho is just sad. 

&gt;Here is what I believe to be the reason for Liverpool's inconsistency, INJURIES! 

In caps! Have you considered bolding it as well? How surprising, a team of 11 players don't play the same all the time because different members of the 11 players get injured at different times. 

&gt;Obviously he has made mistakes, but everyone makes mistakes and he has shown he can produce great balls over top to Liverpool's attack.

If everyone makes mistakes, why mention his? 

&gt;Skrtel, who started off the year as a substitute has shown an unbelievable amount of passion and desire for Liverpool as he has produced 4 goals this season. 

Skrtel, who started ~~off~~ the year as a substitute, has **outlined** ~~shown an unbelievable amount of~~ his ~~passion and desire~~ ~~for~~ **importance to** Liverpool by chipping in with 4 goals this season**, a great tally for a centreback.**

&gt;Glen Johnson who has been having a very poor season due to his injury has been replaced by the young John Flanagan.

The young John Flanagan, who has replaced Glen Johnson due to injury. 

&gt;Not to mention the real cracker of a goal he had versus Spurs.

Incomplete sentence. 

&gt;Last but not least, Aly Cissoko.

The most overused cliche ever. 

&gt;Jose Enrique was major blow earlier this season 

Is he Captain Cocaine now?

&gt;once again thanks to Brendan Rodgers, we have an experienced back up in Cissoko. 

Didn't you thank him for ""having a rotation"" earlier?

&gt;Cissoko is of course not the best, but he has certainly shown he wants to win and help the team. He has produced enough solid games to keep up the reds in the top 4.

While not the best, Cissokho has played solidly to help keep the Reds in the Top 4, with standout performances at XXX and YYY. 

&gt;Other than the back four we have also seen our very consistent, defensive midfielder go out due to injury, Lucas Leiva.

So Lucas Leiva is a midfielder who is very consistent and defensive? It should be ""Other than the defenders, we have also seen Lucas Leiva, our consistent defensive midfielder missing due to injury"". 

&gt;He is basically an extra center back building a brick wall for Simon Mignolet, the Liverpool keeper.

No, I thought Mignolet was a contractor in charge of supervising the masonry. 

&gt;We have seen the likes of Joe Allen fill in for him especially when Gerrard was out.

Are you going to explain what Gerrard's absence has to do with this? 

&gt;I believe the occasional inconsistency of the club is due to the immense amount of injuries. 

Immense? 

&gt;Rodgers, Mignolet, Kolo, and anyone on the team are not blame for a game in which Liverpool have dropped points.

If you're not going to blame players or the manager for playing poorly, then there really isn't anything else you can blame players for. 

&gt; this new highly attacking goal scoring Liverpool 

Needs more adjectives. 

&gt;I leave you with this, that thrashing 5-1 victory over Arsenal has most certainly given the reds a boost of confidence and shows that we can beat the big named teams. Lets keep the momentum going and get this top four spot! YNWA

Living on campus will be lots of fun as there will be lots of people in the same situation as you. Musselburgh and nearby Portobello are both nice wee seaside towns (you can get sunburn and hypothermia at the same time here) and Edinburgh itself has great history, cultural events (August is crazy - google edinburgh festivals) and good people as well.

They post cann tables when they lead the league, they make team of the week the top post when their players are in it but its barely got 100 votes of they are not, they post all these different tables trying to prove their classiness and I cant stop laughing at them.

So many of these numbers in the other teams are ex Chelsea players. Our academy isn't shit just because we dont retain them. Given how our players have been treated while putting in better performances for England in the past,  I don't give two shits if our academy doesn't contribute further even though I am born and bred.

Things to do ( as in MUST do): Visit London for a day out/ Go to Wales whilst it sunny (it's fucking beautiful)/ Go to the pub!/ Go to a local football (soccer) game/ Go to Oxford/ See as many historical sites (Roman ruins, castles, Hadrians Wall, Cathedrals ect) as possible/ Visit the North (I would suggest at least seeing Liverpool and York) and also check out Scotland. 

Believe me, all of those things sound so vast but the UK is so small you could drive all those places and back within a day.

As for things you should know...British people tend to be very conservative. Not politically (although David Cameron IS in power...), but socially. A ritual greeting of 'alright?' replaces 'hello' in many places across the country, and I wouldn't recommend actually answering. Just say 'alright' back and smile. Drinking in public is accepted and commonplace in the north (and in many ares in the south too).

Can't think of anything else off of the top of my head...Oh right...British humour is dry and deadpan. You may think people are insulting you when really here thats how we all laugh. (Not at Americans...just at each other in general). I suppose the '\#BANTZ' culture doesn't help.

With regards our transfers I'm not as bothered as some that we didn't get anybody new in, I think the team can get fourth without new bodies and the title was out of our reach, mostly because if we did get seriously into the race we would not have coped mentally that well without any real experience of a race for anything for most of the players sand Rodgers (bar promotion)

What did trouble me about the window was mentioned in the video and that's a lack of solidarity. Do FSG/transfer commitee trust Rodgers' judgement? Will they go after not the players we needs to maintain our progress but the players that can elevate us above that? Will this lack of coherence cost us more targets?

I also worry, like everyone else it seems, about our ability to get targets but more so our tendency to fail to get publicised targets. I understand it being difficult to get players of a certain standard for a certain amount of cash and that is fine but the clubs obsession with ""bargains"" needs to stop. It worked well with Coutinho/Sturridge but it has also cost us money with Ilori/Aspas/Alberto who haven't contributed much this season and probably won't do next year either. (can't say too much on the quality of these lads yet because they haven't fucking played much).

We all know how important the summer transfer window will be regardless of what happens in the league and the need to sign top quality players quickly will probably make or break the following season (dramatic as that sounds!) a committee that's been together for three windows can surely get it together  but if they don't it should be changed altogether either with new personnel or a new structure.",0,1392108464,null,0,false,0,cfcft20,t3_1xkbni,t1_cfcft20,t3_1xkbni,null,1432347262,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

However, fast forward a few years with large population growth and it's taking so much out that the rivers aren't having time to replenish/recover as underground rivers take much longer than surface water to do so. 

This is all due to there being no negative impacts financially to the company, 95% of people don't know it's happening nor understand where their water even comes from, and there's no to very little regulation in place to say they should change practise.

So while religious types might meet up to talk about god, reinterpretations of scripture, re-learn and reinforce the lessons of their faith, atheist types have equivalent topics; innovations in science, political affairs, moral and philosophical debates.

In short, atheists as a group largely *do* share beliefs and values. And likely have just as much in common as members of a religious soc.

Finally, part of the reason atheists feel a need to clump together into societies is to show solidarity and have a common voice to oppose the influence held by large religious groups - and a lot of the ground these groups are fighting over is stuff like evolution, age of the earth, etc. Large focus groups are able to pressure government and policy moves to a disproportionate extent, and large self-declared atheist societies can counterbalance the influence of extreme religious ones.",0,1392110259,null,0,false,0,cfcg47f,t3_1xj1jp,t1_cfcg47f,t1_cfcfirt,null,1432347407,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; About the size of my 1st living room.

Imagine you made a box that had the profile of a doorway. This is about 0.8m x 2m. 

If it had a square base, the volume would be 1.28 cubic metres. That box is just enough for you to stand up in and it's just a bit wider than your shoulders. you could turn around in this volume, you could squat down but that's about it. Try sitting comfortably inside a doorway.

So 3 cubic metres is roughly two-and-a-half of those boxes in volume. EDIT: About equal to an under-stairs storage area.

That is a very small living room.

The EPS classifies a ""mid sized car"" as being roughly [3 cubic metres of interior volume](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-size_car).

On the contrary, despite some strong ""small Government"" rhetoric from the Conservatives immediately after the 2010 election, when you look at the reality they have continued doing what every government since 1997 has done, and increased the centralisation of power.

For example in our education system, the rise of Academies and Free Schools means that local councils no longer have any say in how those educational establishments are run. The only person who can dictate what those schools can and can't do is the Minister for Education.

This trend has continued in other aspects as well. The NHS reforms, although theoretically putting financial control in the hands of local-ish doctors, also give the Minister for Health an enormous ability to personally take control of huge chunks of the health service, including issuing orders to permanently shut entire hospitals.

And in general, money has poured away from local councils and from community initiatives. Nobody in government ever speaks of the Big Society any more. That's because they've been quietly cutting not only the amount of funding to NGOs, quangos and community groups but also restricting ever more tightly what they can do. Look at the Environment Agency, whose local workers in Somerset said they needed £4 million for flood defence; they were given just a tenth of that by DEFRA.

Children are being forced to endure such circumstances.

HMRC have recently made declaring tax even simpler, and crypto profit is a single item, so its pretty straight forward (get an expert to walk you through it once, then you should be able to pick it up yourself), well done to HMRC to be fair.

I do take the point that free schools and academies are directly accountable to central government, but as they are less affected by standards such as the national curriculum and influence from local government I would say that balances out on the authoritarian scale.

I'm not familiar with the NHS reforms nor the handling of the EA, but limiting the power of NGOs, quangos and community groups may be interpreted in similar terms: power is being moved around government rather than out of it. There are pretty obvious dangers with centralising power as opposed to devolving it, but both are authoritarian in the sense of being controlled by political power as opposed to free association and decisions made without interference from third parties.

All of the political rhetoric is empty. All of the claims of the right wingers has been proved blantly false. They don't need to provide sources for speeches, so they don't. Where are these millions of Romanians and Bulgarians? It was all scaremongering. It's the same with benefit scroungers - over half of all government welfare in the UK goes to pensioners, but no political party riles up crowds about that, because pensioners vote. Vast hordes of immigrants and benefit scroungers don't vote, because they don't exist! But they get people scared and angry which means votes. Without anyone to call bullshit on the absurd claims of the extremist right you get a horrific situation like the Golden Dawn in Greece.

Take a look at Britain. Go to the dole office - Who's there? Is everyone in the job centre an immigrant? No, I'd be shocked if any are. Is the job centre full of ""scroungers""? I highly doubt it. Sure, there are a few scumbags who fiddle the system, but they are very much the minority.

Every time you read an article or hear a speech about these issues, look at the sources. 99% of the time you will find the sources to be highly suspect or just straight up fantasy.

In terms of tax returns, Bitcoin should be treated as an asset and taxed as such. Business have to declare the assets they hold in their accounts, and individuals have to declare any profits on trading assets which are then subject to capital gains tax. We should avoid trying to create a new tax framework for Bitcoin and adding to the administrative burden for individuals and businesses.

In relation to VAT, the existing rules for sales should apply. The country of the end customer and, if they're in the EU, their local equivalent tax registration status, determines the applicable VAT. The value of the transaction has to be recorded on the company accounts and VAT charged accordingly. This already happens with non-GBP transactions for UK companies, and if the HMRC wish to set the exchange rate for BTC to GBP for accounting purposes they should add it to http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/exrate/

The idea behind it is that people are not going to give up anything be it heroin or cigarettes unless they are ready to. But the nature of heroins illegality means it has more of an impact on the day to day life of the user - you don't have to wait about for your dealer to turn up to get your pack of cigerettes, not having your cigerette that day isn't going to have you locked up in bed trying not to crap yourself etc. Thus its very hard to keep a job and get yourself out of that cycle on something like heroin or crack cocaine for that matter. Being given supervised heroin takes the worry of sourcing the drug and the withdrawal associated with it , allowing people to rebuild their lives far quicker. 

""Today, there are 23 clinics across the country that treat roughly 2,200 drug users, or about 6% of the nation's heroin addicts. The average stay is three years — a quick stint for users who average 15 years of heroin use. Less than 15% relapse into daily use""

Right. But the perception is that the people who are entrusted with preparing for this sort of major situation have done a crap job. This applies to town planners approving unsuitable developments on unsuitable land (such as floodplains) and to the various agencies responsible for mitigating against flooding. This includes not spending the necessary funds on the upkeep of existing prevention systems (drainage, barriers, etc.) and not investing in new and improved defences as requirements have grown or shifted.

In some cases the old infrastructure can actually create problems. In one case, can't remember where exactly, SW I think, the narrow arches on an old stone bridge caused debris to build creating a damn effect. When the damn burst it caused a massively destructive flash flood.

true,whatisthisaRUSE,lfc99,,"Also, I think it's a great indication for the future. Don't know if it's the same in English, but in Norway we have a word called winning culture. I think the reason United was so dominant was because Ferguson managed to make winning an integral part of the club mentality and culture. I think we could do the same with the way the club is being managed at the moment. We have many young players that lack experience and in a couple of years they could be our Scholes, Giggs, Neville etc. Right now we have a great foundation for the future. One other thing I think Ferguson did right was he never signed to many players and always had a ""core"" of players and a squad who knew the culture of the club and helped new players settle and adapt the mentality of the club. If we could keep up this work I think that would be the case for us as well. Looking at the team last game we had Skrtl and Gerrard who were the only two players who have been at the first team for a long time. We also have a new manager, system, owners etc. It is like the club has been reborn and people forget ""how young we still are"". I think if done the correct way this could be the start of an era for Liverpool. This is the thing I love about BR. THE MAN HAS A PLAN (*cough* Moyes *cough*). And I think that what we see this season is how huge the benefit of sticking to our plan has been. BR have learned from earlier mistakes and the team is learning. We fuck up less and less and I think soon the 1-1 at West Brom will be 1-0. Maybe it's just me but I see/feel a mentality and culture developing in the club. Just look at the determination against Spurs, Everton and Arsenal. And look at how the players celebrate the goals. I'm so excited for the future and can't wait to see the club develop, hopefully in the right direction. I'll be here anyways. It's not long ago I sat in my sofa watching us play Stoke football with the likes of Carroll, Downing and Konchesky. I will dream of the title as long as the math adds up, but I'll take 4th any day.

Yes the bus was avoided at all costs by most people but on a cold and rainy night it's very tempting. I would go on with a couple of young girls who were in on the fact that I was a support worker and as far as the Jesus army knew I was homeless.


 They would focus on young vulnerable kids and do everything they could to get them to join them especially if they had some sort of artistic talent.

It should be noted that a lot of the youth you see begging are junkies who do have flats but never go there because they are more comfortable with the homeless culture. 

Kids would get on there and disappear and we would never be able to get in contact with them again, there was one recovering junkie kid who was a DJ who had been with them, left and told us that they took him to the farm but it was too weird for him. They ended up luring him back with a promise of help with his DJ career - this kid was actually very talented and had several indie CDs and was generating a lot of interest, that was the last anyone ever saw of him.

That is, it can be reasonably expected that such an event might happen once in a hundred years or so. However, with records only going back a few hundred years in the UK, and modelling only able to predict so much, there is still a great deal of uncertainty.

My wife was involved in a major engineering project to protect a water treatment works near Tewkesbury. It flooded a few years back and left many thousands without water for an extended period of time. The engineering was done to protect it against a 'thousand year event' - that is the worst possible scenario imaginable at the time.

The work was completed, and guess what? This is that thousand year event, just 5 years later. That throws both the periodicity calculations into question (I.e. are we now dealing with a hundred year event? A Decade event? Will this happen every year?) and means that if it floods again, not only were the protections inadequate but that even MORE money will have to be spent to protect (or relocate) it going into the future.

Ultimately, we've had a truly exceptional period of extended rainfall, and that floods things. You can to some extent choose what you allow to flood and what you protect.

In their last 6 they have won 4 drawn 1, we have won just 2 and drawn 2. 

Calling the Spurs game a fluke loss is glossing over the frailties in our side. Overall we played better football, but you don't get points for style. The fact is we only managed to sustain pressure for a total of about half an hour, and only tested the keeper on a few occasions- call it a fluke, or whatever you like, but the fact is that we didn't do anywhere near enough in front of goal to win that game.

The main issue is that we have kept 1 clean sheet in the last 10, whilst that would be fine for a side like Liverpool- we do not have the quality going forward to just outscore teams- and worryingly it does not seem like a pattern that is going to stop.

---

Once again we are just being killed by draws- whilst we have shown more sting this season in turning 1-1 into 2-1, 9 draws so far is just too much. For some perspective Spurs and Liverpool both have 5. There are so many people defending these draws as decent performances against hard to beat teams... Well, if you want top 4 you need to beat these teams, and we are just not doing it.

He was hired at perfect timing, the pressure was on the owners after they fired KK. We were as low as we could get, under Everton, Spurs, Newcastle and the other top 4. He had much to improve, we weren't scoring a lot, playing frustrating football etc. So we had tons to look forward to. But that won't be the case with a stable team that is always in top 1-2.

For british managers, Liverpool job is huge, only United and England job probably go above it. There is no other place to carve out your history. Who will know what manager won trophies for City and Chelsea in 30 years unless they obviously pull United under SAF.

He then uses unemployment graph, that starts at 2004, talks about the changes post 2012 (irrelivent) and then looks at a RPI income adjusted graph since 1964!

I get the impression he just googled image searched some graphs, didn't even look at the data properly, presented it **very** poorly.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've been thinking about this alot lately too. 

I figured something cool out the other week. Shopify doesn't have a directory of the retailers who use it's platform, BUT you can do specific Google searches to find UK companies that use it.

e.g. on Google UK search for ""by Shopify"" (including quotes) and make sure it only shows UK results. This way it finds all the UK retailers who use the line ""ecommerce by shopify"" or ""software by Shopify"" that is usually included at the bottom or in the terms and conditions of the sites. There are 100s

Why this is important is that Shopify retailers only have to sign up to BitPay and then pretty much flick a switch in the Shopify admin to automatically start accepting Bitcoin. That's 10 minutes work on their part, opening them up to 1000s more customers and possibly getting free advertising from it too. They still receive payment in £ so it seems like something that may be worth their time.

I've put together a list with about 100 retailers on it so far that I was planning on contacting. Maybe I could stick it up in a Google doc and share it and we could contact the ones we're interesting in seeing adopt BTC?

Look, here's the deal with pitbulls - they're huge, they're strong, they're pure muscle, they're bred to fight, they have a high pain threshold, and they're scary-looking. To both people and to other dogs. Are their personalities a ""tabula rasa"" in the sense that they can they be just as harmless as any other dog if raised in the right environment? Yes, probably often-to-most of the time.
There are a couple of problems with this though. One, many pit bulls are not raised in ""the right environment."" A lot of the ones who are rescued from crappy environments, sadly, have either been abused or have at least ""seen some shit"" and are broken, and are beyond rehabilitation - they are ticking time bombs. They won't necessarily attack a person or other dog at any given time, but the odds that they will attack someone at some point are definitely elevated. It's not that they haven't attacked anyone, it's that they haven't attacked anyone yet. And it only happens once - they have to get put down after the first time.
On top of all this, because they are so strong and scary and intimidating, **if they DO get into a fight, the likelihood that they will injure or kill the person or animal they are fighting with, is much higher. They will stay in the fight longer, they will probably win, and it is much harder to get them to STOP fighting.** I have had Jack Russells most of my life. Every once in a while they get into a fight, and sometimes it gets pretty bad, maybe one will grab the other by the scruff and there is squeaking and I have to separate them, and maybe a dog starts bleeding a bit or gets hurt from being slammed on the ground. But that's usually the worst of it. Now if one of them were fighting with a pit bull, and the pit grabbed a jack (or god forbid a child) by the scruff and started jerking him around, the little jack is fucking dead with the first snap of the jaws. That isn't a prejudice thing, it's a body mass and strength thing.
Add to this the fact that other dogs are naturally intimidated by pit bulls' size and appearance and they are more likely to interpret an ambiguous behavior as aggressive, and therefore to start a fight to defend themselves. Again, this supersedes any human ""prejudice,"" this is a phenomenon that other species can see too.
So yes, given all this, I am very wary of pit bulls. If someone I know and trust has raised a pit from 8 weeks, and I know it to be a well-trained, friendly dog, then I am unreservedly fine letting my dog play with the pit. But if someone I think is kind of irresponsible, or who adopted an adult pit from an abusive or unknown background, I don't want my dogs around it, even more so than most other breeds. It's just common sense.",0,1392125078,null,0,1392125324,0,cfcimyd,t3_1xljy4,t1_cfcimyd,t3_1xljy4,null,1432348615,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Therefore housing costs are relative to the market - If you double every households buying power, or even half it, the cost of housing will basically just double or halve.

Government subbsidies (both UK and European) incentivise landowners turning the maximum possible area into ploughed fields, and the greedy buggers have taken every penny on offer.
* there's this misguided idea that you're supposed to dredge rivers to allow them to drain their catchment more quickly. What this actually does is allow downstream areas to be flooded more rapidly. Actual scientists who study this stuff say you should plant more trees, hedges etc, and allow rivers to be closer to their natural state (winding and half-choked with supermarket trollies) to slow down the water.

In truth, their fondness for people and gentle nature actually make them terrible as guard dogs, or even attack dogs.

If you see a Staffie with a problem you should look to whoever is holding the lead because that is most likely where the problem lies.

But how would you, the viewer, determine that? If and when a showrunner casts Helen Mirren as the Doctor, that showrunner isn't going to say ""we cast Helen to appease the feminists"", surely? I trust you won't assume the worst as soon as someone other than a white male is cast?

And given that the Doctor is an alien with no ties to Earth or its culture other than a superficially human appearance, couldn't casting a specifically white male actor be considered just as much shoehorning as any other decision?

Let's recall that the Doctor was initially played by a man in his fifties, yet he's been played three times by actors who were cast in their late twenties. David Tennant and Matt Smith are up there among the most popular actors to play the Doctor, and Peter Davison has his own enthusiastic fanbase too. When these Doctors were cast and accepted (more or less) by the fans, it was at least partly on the basis that they could play characters older than themselves. The magic of acting - *and the alien nature of the Doctor* - allowed for that suspension of disbelief. You can't abjure that second part of the rationale. It was especially central to Smith's portrayal of an ancient being at the end of its life in the body of a young man. Age might be a different category to race, but in any production other than Doctor Who a twenty-six-year-old would be laughed off the stage for playing an eighty-year-old man. But this *is* Doctor Who, and in Doctor Who we *can* take it seriously - for a little while, anyway.

By all means judge whoever is cast as future Doctors on the basis of their skill, but other than that if you suspect there is some sort of PC motivation behind the casting just take a moment to *really* think if you're being consistent.",0,1392128650,null,0,false,0,cfcjn8s,t3_1xlosp,t1_cfcjn8s,t3_1xlosp,null,1432349136,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

He has not been playing well enough (even though I fully acknowledge and appreciate his effort and improvement) to keep a better player out of the side.

Not sure about the heritage railway, if they own it they might be able to cut a deal with NR to allow for them to use it provided it's not needed for anything else.

these are the people who call chanting and shouting 'violence'. Can you not see how in this quote they make very little, with fiery rhetoric, attempt to seem like a lot. The totality of 'damage' was a bit of graffiti on 'historic' buildings (what building isn't historic?), a door that came off its hinges, and some pushing and shoving with staff. Can you find any evidence of anything else apart from this? No (in fact photos show security staff pinning protesters down and punching them). 

In fact the only person who was taken to hospital was one of the protesters who was held inside a kettle illegally for 4 hours and collapsed, after which the police refused to let an ambulance into the university grounds to help her. 

&gt;Your perceived ""right to free speech"" which we don't even technically have in this country doesn't give you the right to deface and damage property and hurt staff. 

Free speech is more important that property, especially when 'damage' is writing on a wall. How do you think the freedom to think and speak freely was won? I'll tell you now it was a lot more 'violent' than this, and it doesn't just stay, it has to be defended. But I'm glad to hear that if Hitler had invaded Britain today you would have done everything short of anything to save your freedom of speech, anyone who 'resisted' by writing on walls would be against freedom of speech…right.

true,scottyj1994,null,null,"Ill try and touch on the some things that havent been mentioned

Right Back  +  Left Back
These are typically in my mind the easiest positions to play in the team. 
A good fullback typically will achieve the following goals :
1) Keep the winger coming at him quiet
2) Hold the line well with his fellow defenders - the line refers to the invisible offside line along the defence. Managers will have different ideas about how high they should hold this line depending on the teams philosophy. But holding the line is crucial to any defender, if one is too deep players are onside, and vice versa if one is too high.
3) Pass the ball well out of defense - look to find midfielders and target men like Adebayor rather than an inaccurate long pass to nobody
4) ""overlap"" the winger and try to add an extra number into attack with focus on good crossing and pace

I feel Kyle Walker and Rose in the main do no 4 very welll, Walker does 3 better than Rose. Both rely to heavily on their pace to bail them out of problems with 1 and 2. 
Benoit Assou Ekotto came across as a very effective LB in his time here because his passing was incredibly accurate and effective, much more so than the current full backs.

Centre Backs 
For me there are a few types of successful centre back
You have the no nonsense player who is tough but fair in the tackle, occasionally too passionate to demonstrate to other players what it really means, and is typically very good in the air and controlling the defence. He lacks pace and occasionally makes big mistakes This is Michael Dawson
You have the defender that is a bit lightweight but is just as quick as most strikers, has the touch and confidence of a midfielder to carry the ball forward. Almost certainly has a mistake in him round the corner, but very nice to watch. This is Vlad Chiriches and a younger Billy Gallas
The combination is the near perfect defender pre 2007 Ledley King or Jan Vertonghen.
Centre Backs real responsibility is to prevent goals by any means!

Right Midfield Left Midfield
Again there are a few types
Less attractive clubs will employ Central midfielders who lack pace in these positions because they will work hard and understand their defensive responsibilites better than an out an out winger. Think James Milner at Man City in the past, even Gareth Barry has played on the wing before and hes about as quick as your dad!
Spurs have a long tradition of fine wing players - Cliff Jones, Ricky Villa, David Ginola, Darren Anderton, Lennon, Bale, Lamela etc....
In my mind a winger should have significant ability to unlock defenses through skill pace or strength. It is a REQUIREMENT in my mind that they can beat their full back. Siggurdson struggles with this and shouldnt be played wide! Crossing ability and the ability to pick out a pass are also a requirement. 
I feel Lennon has improved in all these areas over the years and it will be exciting to see how Townsend and Lamela develop.

I understand that you'll be disappointed on that score, but as a straight male I like the Doctor as a complex character who can be admired - and that's how I think of the companions as well. Billie Piper's pretty, but I didn't like Rose for romantic reasons, I liked her because I sympathized with her concerns and wanted her to get what she was looking for in life.

I'm not criticizing the place of romance in Doctor Who, but I'm hoping you can recognize that Doctor Who is not at heart a love story, and has value beyond the romantic qualities of its leads, and ideally can stand or fall on its own merits whether or not any of the characters are attractive.

To put it another way, I suspect Kirk and Picard have very different levels of conventional sexual attractiveness, but Picard is nevertheless recognized as a worthy successor to Kirk as captain of the Enterprise, right? It's still recognizably Star Trek, isn't it? I think the Doctor is as much an archetype as he is a specific character. Romana and, to some degree, River Song are both instances of characters taking on consciously Doctor-like qualities, though they are very different characters to any Doctor we know.",0,1392129161,null,0,false,0,cfcjte7,t3_1xlosp,t1_cfcjte7,t1_cfchse5,null,1432349216,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt;

&gt;**Tool** is an American [rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up has included drummer [Danny Carey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Carey), guitarist [Adam Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Jones_(musician\)), and vocalist [Maynard James Keenan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_James_Keenan). Since 1995, [Justin Chancellor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Chancellor) has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist [Paul D'Amour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_D%27Amour). Tool has won three [Grammy Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards), performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.

&gt;The band emerged with a [heavy metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music) sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and later became a dominant act in the [alternative metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_metal) movement with the release of their second album, Ænima, in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, [visual arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts), and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and commercial success around the world.

&gt;Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of [progressive rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock), [psychedelic rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock) and [art rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_rock). The relationship between the band and today's [music industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry) is ambivalent, at times marked by [censorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_music) and the band's insistence on privacy.

He used to show me videos of Chelsea in the 1970's (the 2 legged FA Cup Final is a must watch) and 1980's and I fell in love with the histroy of the club, despite not winning much. Osgood, Chopper Harris, Bonetti and Dixon all became heroes of mine despite being way before my time. Then he started taking me to games and I was hooked. Gullit, Zola, Vialli, Lebouef, Desailly et al. Success didn't really matter too much to me. The Roman Revolution brought an exciting new chapter attracting players, managers and success that I could not have dreamed of. If, however, Roman had not came and we had not had the success we have had so far, I would still be as blue as I am now. 

As for foreign fans, I say the more the merrier! If they can get 1% of the pleasure I do from being a Chelsea fan, why would anyone want to deny them that? I want Chelsea to be seen as an inclusive club for everyone, as long as you just haven't jumped ship from another team just because they aren't doing so well (I'm looking at you ex-Man Utd fans)! I think some people in the UK find it hard because we didn't have a choice as to who we support and feel like alot of people are jumping on the bandwagon as soon as we have had some success. As long as you stick with us through thick and thin I don't mind.

I've just spent the last 10 days in Mumbai working, people are happy, it's chilled and even though there's a ton of poverty and the traffic and pace are mad, no-one seems to give a fuck. They just do their own thing at their own pace. People actually talk to each other without needing an ulterior motive. What's that about? 

You could say that there's a lot of love there. There's fuck all here. 

When you arrive back, you can see it in peoples faces, we're stressed to hell. You can feel the tension like an elastic band ready to snap. 

I put it down to too much interference in our lives, we're not being allowed to be who we think we want to be here. And who we think we want to be is defined by all the wrong reasons and motives. 

 Too many rules, too many regulations, too much emphasis on work, money making and business. Too many people trying to sell us shit we don't need. Too many people in pseudo authoritative positions trying to squeeze more money out of us and trying to tell us what to do, who to be, where to be. Way too many busybodies and we're being fed this constant onslaught of depressing news and even more  depressing entertainment. 

We've turned into a society where pretty much everyone is on the take and nobody really gives a shit about anyone else. 

But I don't believe that's our fault, I feel we've been driven towards it, mainly because those we elect only represent their own needs and the people with power are literally sucking us dry. We're paying these people through the nose so they can service their own needs, we're getting pretty much nothing back and they're ruining what we do have. 

Their own rhetoric is rubbing off on the common man too: ""If they don't give a shit any more ( and they don't ) then why should I?""




I will say though that this country may be relatively safe, but damn does that come at a cost.  

You could say I'm painting a pretty depressing picture of this country here but, to be honest, I'm not really seeing anything else.

Because race and gender are fundamentally different from age; they're far more static.

Think about it--we all pass through many different ages in life, from child to adult to old age, but we are *always* part of the gender(s) or race(s) we are born into. 

I'd be fine with them changing the Doctor's race if it was done correctly, but the key thing is, it can't be done just for the sake of changing the Doctor's race. As others in this thread have said, the actor who is cast has to be the best for the role and not just shoehorned into the show for diversity's sake. 

I would be less fine with changing the Doctor's gender, since I think that would be a more fundamental change to his character. Going in and saying ""oh, by the way, the Doctor has always been transgendered, (s)he's just never bothered to exhibit this in any previous regenerations"" rewrites a shit-ton of cannon, again for no reason other than diversity.

A badly cared for dog (and the signs of that are often too subtle) can snap, and when a big dog snaps there are going to be tears. The focus needs to be on education, even simple things like reminding people actually walk their dogs properly.

I love these dogs, and will fight any BSL that comes from this unless it is sensible. Which it won't be.

In my opinion, these dogs should not be banned, but there are plenty of people that should be banned.

I'm on just under half that, though to be fair, I don't know how well finance pays - obviously I don't know your specific role either, but I imagine you'd do well to get £40-45k at your age, with your qualifications and experience. $70k is £42k, for what it's worth.

Regarding the journey - depending where in London you want to work - you're looking at between a 60-90 minute drive into town, as London is straight down the M1 from Northampton, though this would obviously be more during the morning and evening rush. You could probably get the train down too, which would likely not take much more than an hour.

Regarding finding a job, I suppose I got a bit lucky - I sent out CVs via websites and recruitment agencies toward the end of my Master's. Little previous experience other than a placement year and a bit of small amount of personal projects. I got a few interviews for jobs in the £20k area, without success.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"Some people are asking why this is a bad thing; let's look at what the relevant bits of the bill do:

* It makes landlords liable to a £3,000 fine if anyone allowed to live in the rented property is in the UK illegally (in some ways), even if they were not named on the rental agreement, or if they were a legal resident at the start of the agreement,

* It makes it illegal for a bank to open an account for someone who is in the UK illegally unless they have carried out a background check,

* It bans people from getting a driving licence unless they fit into a few categories of legal immigrant (but it still bans some people in the UK legally, I think).

Taking these one at a time, the landlord requirement has several problems. The most obvious one is about how hard it is to know if someone is in the UK legally - immigration law is pretty complicated; and even the Home Office regularly seems to get it wrong. The result of this could be that landlords will refuse to rent to anyone who looks remotely foreign, as even if they appear to have appropriate paperwork, they might still be present illegally (or be illegal before their rent ends). Except none of this applies to people from the EEC or Switzerland, even if they are here illegally.

The Bill even contains a specific provision for the creation of a code of practice to prevent illegal discrimination - which to me suggests the Government is admitting they expect this law to cause mass discrimination.

The bank account provision is interesting in that it only covers *opening* an account - so if someone not in the UK opens one, then comes here illegally (or legally, but stays beyond their permission) they're able to keep using the account. Also banks don't get fined for non-compliance, unlike landlords.

So this stuff adds extra paperwork. It encourages suspicion (people having to check everyone to see if they are illegal), particularly of anyone who seems remotely foreign (although, of course, the Government can take away British people's citizenship). It is privatising the ""Papers please!"" mentality.

And what about the positive effects? Is it going to stop people coming here or staying here illegally? No, it just means that they're not going to have driving licences, have to stay/rent with dodgy landlords, or try to hide, and they're not going to be able to use our banks.

---------------------------

A couple of other points; from my limited understanding of immigration law etc., this isn't aimed at people who sneak into the country illegally - they're unlikely to be renting, using banks, taking driving tests etc. anyway. This is more aimed at the people who come here legally and then end up overstaying their visas (e.g. coming here as students and then settling down with a family).

Other things this bill does:

1. gives the Government the power to deport families of people here illegally (even if they themselves are here legally, I think),
2. lets the Government demand biometric data from people coming here, or applying for British citizenship, 
3. severely limits the ability to appeal immigration decisions by the Home Office (they keep losing appeals, so rather than fixing their system they're removing the ability to appeal in many cases),
4. tries to redefine Article 8 of the ECHR to make it easier to deport people the Government doesn't like (I'm not sure if the Courts will accept this),
5. lets the Government impose an unlimited ""charge"" on immigrants (in theory to cover their use of the NHS, but it isn't required to be anything to do with the NHS),
6. makes marriage registrars refer potentially-suspicious marriages to the Government, so they can decide whether it is a ""genuine relationship.""

To me this Bill seems to be blatant foreigner-bashing; making it harder and more expensive for people to live here if they might look or be foreign. Some of it may be in breach of the ECHR or EU law.

University education is a difficult one. Bearing in mind you expect higher earnings with a degree, the poorer people who enter lower paid positions ending up paying for the richer to study making them even richer. On the other offering free education for all allows people to break free and get higher paid jobs. In an ideal world I agree it would be free. Tony Blair introduced the fees after the Tory's increased the amount of places. Remember the government still heavily subsidise universities. 

Jobs for life were always unusual and were often unionised. Print, docks, miners etc. For the average university graduate in the free jobs market jobs for life wasn't a thing. 

I know what your saying though. It's does seem the rich are getting in-proportionately rich. The balance has gone off cock.

MBAs are aimed more at managerial level but it's hardly unheard of for someone with an MSc to achieve the same (additionally, many MSc students are experienced learners as it is).

Of course, as far as I know, this could be different in America.

true,kvural,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; Think about it--we all pass through many different ages in life, from child to adult to old age, but we are always part of the gender(s) or race(s) we are born into.

I think you're underestimating how fluid both gender and race are. Jazz musician Billy Tipton lived as a woman until his mid-twenties. (And was treated as a man from then on; no one discovered he was born a woman until the postmortem, including his children and partners!) The first African-American major league baseball player died legally identifying as white, even though he was born (in legal terms) black and a slave.

It's not just person-to-person; cultural attitudes about these things change very quickly. In the early 20th century you wouldn't have had so much as a raised eyebrow if you believed Englanders, Frenchmen and Germans to be of different races; now that sort of differentiation is largely the interest of fringe groups.

Moreover, we're applying human paradigms to an alien character. For all we know the Time Lords have no concept of race. Sure, there are Time Lords with darker and lighter skin tones, but why should that mean to them exactly what it means to us? Our histories are totally different.

They are characterized as being rather stuffy and conservative in gender terms...but then think about regeneration. In a human woman, you'd imagine beauty to correspond to youth and health (in broad social stereotypes, at least). But for Time Lords, a woman who looks 50 to us may well be 400 - which is rather young for a Time Lord! And Matt Smith, who looks like he's in his late twenties, plays a character over a thousand years old! Imagine what sort of weird attitudes Time Lords must harbor about gender and sex when appearance, chronological age, and health are so disconnected from one another.

Perhaps calling the Doctor transgender is a big retcon...but then if you think about it, in a lot of ways the Doctor doesn't conform even to our expectations of how these things work. He marries a woman several orders of magnitude younger than he is, though he looks substantially younger than she does. He falls in love with Rose, and he's something like forty-plus times as old as she is. And this is on the rare occasions when he even expresses anything approaching romantic or sexual inclinations!

By any human standard of how gender and sexuality ""normally"" work, the Doctor is fairly bizarre. By more inclusive definitions of the term, he's already a transgender character.",0,1392134230,null,0,false,0,cfclrcg,t3_1xlosp,t1_cfclrcg,t1_cfckqt1,null,1432350133,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I think my response to your questions would be:
a) I trust the price stability of bricks and mortar more than I do in stocks and shares! As long as you do not sell, you can ride out any small drops in price in the short term. 
b) It depends on the size and type of property you are looking for and in what area. You should aim to have a 15% deposit without forgetting to set some money aside legal expenses and stamp duty (if any)
c) the agent will take a percentage of whatever rent you receive. Some agents are even offering to pay your rent even if your property is vacant. So no rent = no fees. You should be able to cover your mortgage and agent fees with the rent you can charge, particularly if you do not live at the property as well. All the while someone else is paying off your mortgage for you, by the time you came back to the UK you could have a mortgage free property! I advertised and manage my property myself as it is not too time consuming and therefore do not have to pay an agent, so I am not entirely sure how much they charge but I think it is something in between 7-12%. If I were to move abroad, however, I would certainly consider hiring an agent.

However you describe it it is not a dog with a mind of its own. I'm not going to come up with a comparison because in this case there simple isn't a decent analogy. Even the loaded gun one doesn't work because the control of mechanical items lies purely in the control of the owner (save for malfunctions). Live animals with their own will power are simple not comparable - sorry.

&gt;So what would you suggest? An outright ban on more breeds?

Not at all, I simple feel we need to debate how we can reduce attacks, maulings and the occasional deaths related to dangerous breeds. To just simply ignore it is irresponsible. Wanting a review doesn't necessarily mean a call for the destruction and banning of a breed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Makelele was good, but his form was declining and it was quickly evident that he wasn't good enough anymore. Not with the way Essien and Mikel were playing.

Carvalho is the same story, although he could have played another season or two, but we bought the promising David Luiz as his replacement six months after he left, so it's all good. 

Arjen is the only player to have left Chelsea while playing fantastically during the Roman era. He left for Real Madrid and I fear that Eden will follow in his footsteps. Hazard has already said that his favorite player is Zinedine Zidane and I've read some rumors that Real Madrid is his boyhood favorite club. But if FFP will be as serious as Chelsea perceive it to be, Real will have a difficult time to sign him, considering the acquirements of Gareth Bale for £80m, and Suarez &amp; Agüero constantly being rumored to them. They would most likely cost around £100m-£120m, and Real would most likely make a move for either one of them before they would go for Hazard, who could definitely go for the same price Suarez and Agüero would go for. Also taking into consideration that the Spanish government wants to reduce Real (and Barca's) TV distribution money, while the smaller clubs plea to end to duopoly of the sharing of TV distribution wealth in Spain gets more and more attention, there is a slight possibility they can't afford him.

They could find another manager who has the same or even more skill than Rodgers. Additionally, FSG do not tolerate losing . 

With the Red Sox in 2003, the manager, Grady Little, brought them to the semi-finals of the playoffs and he was promptly fired when he lost the final game of the playoffs. 

In 2011, Terry Francona couldn't control the clubhouse which resulted in the Red Sox missing out on the playoffs. They had a 10 game lead and an assured place in the playoffs barring catastrophic collapse. There was catastrophic collapse. He did not return

In 2012, Bobby Valentine was fired 1 year into his 3 year contract after leading the Red Sox to it's worst season in the past decade. 

FSG has also traded away or let players go if they did not give results. Their business model is about winning games and making money. Losing Suarez would be terrible because he has lifted Liverpool to new heights for the past two years. Rodgers has done great work, but Suarez is simply more valuable than him at the moment. Also, FSG is not stupid. They will not wait around for Rodgers to get into the Champions League. FSG is expecting it by the end of this season. If not, then they will move on and find some other manager who can give them what they want.

true,IUsedToBeZed22,newcr-5,"Columbus Crew SC, Everton, Sky Blue FC","No, or if it is introduced, it will be forty or fifty years from now. It doesn't work with how sports have operated in America for generations and generations. Very few people rich enough to own and operate a soccer team in this country want to take on the risks that would come with lower divisions. There is a pretty pronounced talent differential between each of the American divisions in soccer, and corresponding gaps in attendance, revenue, etc. 

American sports don't have gradual levels of play, for the most part. There is no minor league football (American, aka 'gridball,' or whatever), as college football takes that role. There is a minor league basketball system, but it is wholly unpopular (avg attendance for some of these teams is around 1k, compared to around 18k for the NBA), and consists of teams that are direct affiliates with NBA teams. Minor league baseball has many tiers, with MLB teams having an affiliate in each tier, designed to represent a different level of talent and player development. The idea that teams could move ""up or down"" is very foreign to US sports fans who do not follow soccer teams overseas.

Should MLS embrace pro/rel? Eh, it's not that easy. MLS and the NASL (the second division) don't really get along. There are folks within the NASL that have this pipe dream believe that the NASL will one day overtake MLS. It won't happen. MLS recently announced an affiliate deal with USL-Pro, the third division. Many MLS teams now have a feeder/affiliate club in that division. USL-Pro and NASL *really* don't get along. Lots of bad blood there. Below that, and it's amateur teams made up mostly of college students who are playing during their summer vacation, or other similar types. Hell, even many NASL players need off-season jobs to earn a living wage. The gap between these teams (save for the Cosmos, but that's another bag of worms entirely) and MLS sides is massive, and it's another reason pro/rel won't happen anytime soon.

Most MLS fans actually love that pro/rel doesn't exist. While we've all seen it create some exciting storylines abroad, it means that investors are more likely to make an effort to put a good result on the field. It also makes MLS's parity rules go by much more smoothly, and we LOVE our league's parity. Anything can happen to anyone any given year. Even though teams like the Galaxy and the Red Bulls can attract some great names, there are no giants that dominate the league year in and year out. Every year has its David against these Goliaths, and it's really neat to see. You know how great it feels to watch Man United spend all that money and have all those great players and still be mid-table? That kind of thing can happen any year in MLS. 

(*I really really love MLS, so I'm sorry if I went on a tangent there*)

**TL;DR**--No. It's hard enough to get soccer-ignorant Americans to give a chance to a sport with a clock that counts forwards, a sport in which games can end in a draw, a sport without distractions from the game (music, flashing lights, cheerleaders, ""clap your hands / make noise"" orders from the PA system, commercials, etc.), and a sport that they're convinced is ""gay"" and ""just full of diving divas."" Adding pro/rel not only runs the risk of dissuading possible new fans (and a growing league needs to grow every year), but also would turn the majority of American investors off. The possible benefits (making the league slightly more tolerable to American ""Eurosnobs"" who refuse to watch MLS because it's not as good as top Euro divisions) don't outweigh these costs.",0,1392138067,null,0,1392139312,0,cfcngsj,t3_1xm6ms,t1_cfcngsj,t1_cfcn2s0,null,1432350936,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

This season Brendan has done well using Sturridge/Suarez/Sterling and even Hendo to exploit the space behind the midfield (infront of the defense) and/or space behind the defense. 

It all depends on how Fulham set up. I'd imagine after watching the Arsenal game they'd expect us to come out firing. It will be interesting to see how Brendan sets up as it's an away fixture 3 days ahead of a big cup tie.

You know the extraordinarily cold weather America had? That's something they're not properly prepared for, as it was a strangely strong polar vortex from the north. The south was getting ice like they'd never seen before. 

This polar vortex affected the jet stream, which goes from west to east. A particularly strong polar vortex means a particularly large change in the jet stream, which heavily changes the weather conditions over the atlantic, and slap bang on the british isles. And it's created a very large flood and storm situation, one which isn't what people are normally prepared for.

It might not be much use, but this is what I wrote to my MP

&gt; Dear Julian Huppert,
&gt; 
&gt; I have written to you in the past regarding matters of mass
&gt; surveillance, and as of late matters have come to a head. February 11th
&gt; has been designated 'The day we fight back' and while most of the
&gt; attention is centred around the NSA, there is cause for concern in the
&gt; UK as well.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't oppose surveillance, however surveillance is only legitimate
&gt; when it is targeted, authorised by a warrant, and is necessary and
&gt; proportionate. Mass surveillance contravenes Article 8 (the right to
&gt; respect for private and family life) and Article 10 (the right to
&gt; freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The
&gt; European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly stated that surveillance,
&gt; if conducted without adequate judicial oversight and with no effective
&gt; safeguards against abuse, will never be compatible with the European
&gt; Convention.
&gt; 
&gt; I also believe that Parliament has failed to hold the intelligence
&gt; agencies to account. Parliamentary oversight must be independent of the
&gt; executive, properly resourced, and able to command public confidence
&gt; through regular reporting and public sessions.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to see an independent inquiry, to report before the next
&gt; general election, to recommend legislative reform. This appears to be
&gt; the only way of holding intelligence agencies accountable for their
&gt; actions.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt;

&gt;I'm referring to the network within the UK. It's really not that hard of a concept to grasp.

Then you're not talking about the internet you're talking about a series of interconnected networks and servers,  it's really not a hard concept to grasp.

&gt;&gt;Just because GCHQ has mass gathered this information does not change the fact that the information was there to begin with.

&gt;That completely changes everything because GCHQ are gathering this data without our permission and using it for whatever they want.

No they're not. They gathering meta data that states Number A called Number B at Time C. 

They can't do anything with that information on its own. So unless there's already an investigation in to you, they're doing literally nothing against you.

&gt;&gt;And it is open, stop saying such glorified statements....and for the forseeable future it will be. 

&gt;No it's not. There are thousands and thousands of sites now blocked for access in the UK. That is not an open internet. And considering the information coming out of the snowden files with regards to GCHQ and NSA, the only person make glorified statements here is you.

You're more than welcome to swap ISPs to gain access to those sites.

You agreed to the T&amp;Cs for your ISP so you accepted the right to not view those sites.

In contrast, in China you have no options to access those sites and bypassing those blocks is an offence.

Its not even comparable so stop being so dramatic. 

&gt;&gt;Luckily your opinion is neither fact nor infallable.

true,hazardousplay,present,Eden Hazard,"A lot of Yank supporters come to be as an consequence of a distinctly American social situation: 

Point #1: Americans as a whole are much more transitory, both physical and socially. It's a nation of immigrants, so urban/suburban communities have been constantly evolving for decades. People move for jobs much more than elsewhere. There is much less communal homogeneity because of the constant flux of people in and out of towns and neighborhoods, and so there isn't as much of family/local identity or tradition. This hasn't been the case in the UK until more recently.

Point #2: Nowhere in the world is there a stronger sense of ""individualism"". It's all about making a life for yourself and making yourself happy. The lack of communality from point #1 goes hand in hand with the individualism and the result is that Americans largely have to ""define themselves"", and in a consumerist culture like the United States, that means through buying things and becoming a ""fan"". That's why you get people on here and /r/soccer asking ""which club should I support?"" and posting ""look at my new jersey!"". Asking which club you should support would be a ridiculous question in the UK, but it's a perfectly normal thing in the US.

Point #3: This individualism, combined with the internet and the growing but still low popularity of football in the US, often means people are supporters in isolation. They don't have a father who they go to matches with, or a bunch of mates to banter with. The fraternal aspect just isn't there and it makes for a much different experience and a much different supporter.

It's not right or wrong, but that's just how it is. Everyone here is essentially saying ""Foreign fan? No problem as long as you actually love and support the club/aren't plastic"" which I agree with. Sure you don't get the same experience when football isn't a cultural stalwart, but when the same passion is there, nobody has any right to call you a fake supporter.

However I think it'll have to be via second place or not at all. Can't see us finishing outside the play-offs but can't see us going up that way.

**How is Harry doing?** Personally, I think it's harsh to blame him for performances like last night considering how a lot of us have said before the season started that not getting relegated would be an achievement. So as disappointing as it is to see such a lackluster show last night, in the grand scheme of things we're doing alright, and Harry is doing his job just fine in my book.

**Tom Carroll** I think he's very good technically, but some teams in this division are very physical and so small players like Tom will get bullied off the ball, so perhaps last night and at other times he hasn't been the best selection. Although I have watched him play against weaker teams such as Yeovil this season, where I found him to be decent on the ball.

**Niko Kranjcar** He's obviously very talented, and watching him sometimes is like watching Taarabt, although this applies when he's playing both well and badly. He's got some great goals for us this season and at times his individual flair has been very useful, however it can be infuriating to watch him arrogantly give the ball away through deliberately risky passes and swagger around the pitch when we're chasing the game.

**Jermaine Jenas** Haven't seen a lot of him this season to be honest, would say that he's a player we have enough of and don't particularly need to retain, although this obviously depends on who we lose and bring in come the summer. Decent work rate.

**Assou-Ekotto** Similar to Kranjcar in that he is very talented, yet doesn't *seem* to care much for the team, I think that's fair to say. However he has been one of our most consistent performers this season so I'm not going to slate him. The Burnley home fixture recently was poor, because the third goal especially was his fault for thinking he could physically beat the Burnley attacker, but everyone makes mistakes. The thing that made me angry with him was that when he got knocked over he looked up, saw Burnley would score and went down holding his knee instead of getting up and at least trying to win the ball back rather than pathetically trying to save face. That and the way you'd think he'd learn from his mistake yet invited the same pressure and gave away at least two identical chances from the same mentality later in the game, once in injury time. But other than that game he has been great for us.

***

Overall I think to go up it'll have to be in second place, which should not be out of our reach. It's easy to get overly-pessimistic after watching the game last night but putting things into perspective, we're doing well and still have a great chance of going up.",0,1392143188,null,0,false,0,cfcpwh5,t3_1xjy0d,t1_cfcpwh5,t3_1xjy0d,null,1432352086,5,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,5

There is an issue of supply - which I don't think anybody doubts - and governments are wary of fixing it because increasing house prices seem to lead to votes. Falling house prices causes economic woe, but increasing house prices only really helps governments get voted back in.

The ideal situation would be if the government created a housing scheme which would ensure that house prices could not fall in any real way, but which stimulated house building.

The long term ideal is house prices staying static in real terms, but falling relative to average wages. This would reduce speculation in house prices - people are buying houses simply as an investment regardless of rental income. It would mean that in 20 years houses were considerably more affordable for people, but without the problems a sudden correction would cause (a correction can't really happen anyway because demand is propping up prices).",0,1392143198,null,0,false,0,cfcpwn3,t3_1xlsfl,t1_cfcpwn3,t3_1xlsfl,null,1432352087,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Fluorophore1,SaE,Science,"Hello Cloudman,

To increase your chances of graduate entry, get excellent grades, along with practical lab experience in a setting that is relevant to your chosen field.  Being able to prove that you can pay the course fees in full will also help you gain entry - some courses are oversubscribed and if you snooze you lose  - I have the impression that places are more readily allocated to those who show that they can pay up front and won't have to drop out because they're broke half way through the academic year.

Taught MSc degrees usually accept lower entry qualifications than MSc(Res) degrees.  

You can [contact our international office](http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/international/country/north-america/usa/introduction) for more information about these things once [you've chosen which PG degree you want to do.](http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees)
 
To move here for study, you will need a Tier 4 visa if your chosen course lasts more than 6 months.  There's lots of information about that [here.](http://www.ed.ac.uk/staff-students/students/new-students/visas/need-a-visa)

Finding accommodation when you're here is relatively easy - you can [apply to accommodation services](http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/accommodation) and they'll try (usually successfully) to place you in university accommodation.  In the UK private rooms are the norm, although you may be sharing a kitchen and bathroom - depending on how much you want to pay.  
 

Alternatively, if you want a private flat then there are lots of adverts up around the student union buildings, Gumtree and estate agent shop windows.

true,Ardal,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Before I go any further I should add that I began my working life with BR and after 25 years I retired from a  European Rail Strategy position (on behalf of the UK) and worked almost every conceivable operations job in between. I was a staunch member of ASLEF and later TESSA and believed entirely in National Rail, I fought privatisation for years, then after privatisation I saw the other side of the coin.  

&gt;Funny that isn't it.
They weren't profitable then suddenly when they're sold all of them become hugely profitable.

There is nothing funny about it, managers of national rail were like managers of all other national industries, ""ooops I've gone a couple of million over budget, but what the hell, there's always more money"" The mentality of BR management was disgusting, the senior managers would just say ""we can't deliver"" and the government would cough up more cash (otherwise the media would slaughter whichever party was in power at the time)  the unions miked the railways like a fucking cash cow, my basic pay in the early days was 8k a year I never made less than 20k because of union practices (neither did anyone else) The rolling stock was fucked and had zero investment for decades from EITHER political party. 
Other countries have much lower staff wages than the UK, significantly different infrastructure rules in terms of build and maintenance costs and a very different culture to the UK where intentionally 'stopping the job' is funny as opposed to fucking sickening. 

&gt;Ohhhh you're talking about after the Tories gutted them in order to justify the sale?

The tories didn't gut the railways, both parties did over decades, I know I had to work and manage during both sets of cunts....there is no difference between them except Labour dare not privatise because of their union connections and the money they took from the unions. They ran on a ticket of renationalisation when Blair got in, he had 15 fucking years why didn't he renationalise, even when the unions threatened to pull their millions out of the party (and eventually did) BOTH parties fucked the railway investment strategy for decades before privatisation. 
&gt;Funny how all precedents show that they could do. Don't you think?

What precedents exactly show they could be profitable? The fact that they never were at any time in their history? The fact that the losses suffered were continually growing and performance in terms of budgets, punctuality, delay and cancellation was continually worsening? They are the precedents in this case and absolutely nothing in them pointed to profitability in the future. 

Your 'points' show the view of a sun reader who thinks they know all about the railways when in fact they clearly know nothing at all. 

I'll reiterate, I worked all through both sides of this shit, I absolutely love the uk railway network and the incredible people who keep it running (far more punctually than ever before) If there was a way to make the railway better I (and 99% of the people who work there) would jump at that chance and grasp it with both hands. 

The truth is that after a staggered start where massive investment was needed, the railway companies in the UK have improved beyond comprehension. There are a few remaining pathetic companies that are  genuinely hog tied by agreements made during the national rail days London Midland  for example are fucked by BR agreements, a return to national railways simply cannot work and only those seeking to profit (unions + front line staff) would disagree, those outside the industry who call for renationalisation simply do not understand the complexity of the issue.

* Salmond wasn't promising it, Trump was. Salmond was failed just as much as the rest of us.

Trump and his people have said that Salmond told them not to worry about the wind farm, that it wouldn't happen. EDIT: I appreciate here that it's one sack of hot air's word against another. 

* Or maybe, just maybe, he genuinely disagreed with what Trump was doing...?

Maybe, but what extra information did he have when he started backpeddling that he didn't have when he agreed to the plan? He knew about the plans for the farm so why not back the council from the start?

* The same Aberdeen council widely regarded as morons by most Aberdonians?

I don't see why this is relevant? Or how it can be proven?

1: How on earth could he have known Trump wouldn't deliver?

You can't know for certain, but if Cameron or Blair or anyone else had happily accepted these extremely generous claims about jobs and investment we'd all be going mad-and rightly so.

2: How on earth would he have know ""many"" of the jobs would go to outside contractors? That's no exactly something one includes in a business presentation.

I'm sure there could have been some paperwork written up securing a promise that all jobs created would go to Scottish workers, no?

3; How's being tricked and then penalising the person who tricked him a ""lack of respect""?

It was a lack of respect for the people and politicians in his own country I was referring to. Aberdeenshire council didn't want it, blocked it, and Salmond stepped in and overruled them. Lack of respect.

4: There is no guarantee of an SNP government, as there will be a general election with independence. Scots will be free to choose who leads their new government. Furthermore, I think I had heard Salmond was planning to step down in the event of a Yes vote, but I may have imagined that.

Of course there isn't, but it hardly affects my point that this is a man who hopes to lead an independent Scotland, does it. EDIT 2: I hadn't heard that part about him stepping down.

What really gets me about signing Jenas was that at the same time Faurlin was exiled to sit idle at a circus club in Italy. A bit hard to forgive Redknapp for that one.

&gt; a lot of us have said before the season started that not getting relegated would be an achievement

That's a fair point. In the wake of the Austin signing [I made this comment last summer:](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1jhmf6/charlie_austin_signs_for_qpr_in_a_3_year_deal/cberhk6)
&gt;I'm still going to predict midtable and just enjoy seeing some goals again, and hopefully some more energy at the ground than last season

Expectation A well and truly surpassed, but B and C have fallen well short.

I also made [this comment even earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/1j22i5/the_squad_situation/cbadp5o):

&gt; It's up front where it all looks donald the ducked. Even if they bring in Austin and he gets 25, where will the other 40-45 come from?

It seems all these months later I have my answer - [from barrel-scraping](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/queens-park-rangers/top-scorers).

A bit like the way the media take every comment Jose makes and suggests it's all mind games and also the way in which us fans take comments Jose make as ""taking the pressure off the team"". Not everything he says is cold and calculated, he's a slave to his emotions just like everyone else, which means there's a possibility that he can talk absolute rubbish in the heat of the moment.

What's worse is that now people are dragging Courtois into this little category with comments such as ""Those Belgians sure like to talk"" and are allowing it to tarnish their view on them.

It seems like either of them can't say anything now without some fans taking it the wrong way. I don't think they have said anything bad at all and this particular comment from Lukaku is actually well said and it's something you would expect players of his age and stage of development to be saying. They are both well within their rights to say ""Look how well I am doing, it should warrant a chance in the first team come next season"". That's what we should be encouraging our players to do, if they don't fight for themselves then no one will. It's a big club and, sometimes, you have to make big noises if you want to be heard.

He spends £3M on rollercoaster maintenance, makes £6M overall, has £3M profit

alternatively he adjusts regulation so he only spends £2M on rollercoaster maintenance, nobody knows because this is the real world and the majority of people aren't omniscient rollercoaster safety experts, he still makes £6M in profit

the idea that people can make perfectly informed judgements about everything they do is ridiculous. I can guarantee you you don't know everything you would need to know about every appliance in your home to ensure it's safe for you to use, and are reliant on government regulation in some way. Same goes for rollercoasters, have you looked at the schematic for every ride you would ever go on? have you personally inspected every safety system on all of them? do you have the qualifications to know whether a 2.5 inch bolt is going to support the track if the cart's brakes fail and the cart is over maximum capacity because the operator is a 16 year old with no training? of course not, which is why the government regulate those things, which is why allowing a person who would benefit from improper regulation to regulate is dumb.

I found working in the city, dealing with the kind of people that the press frequently love to demonise to be far better and more preferable to working than many of the people I came across in education and academia.

A problem that the people I know who didn't like about barcap (and have subsequently left) is a hyper competitive culture, they often will have two separate teams doing the same thing in competition.  They felt that due to circumstances outside of their control, the sword dangling above their heads could come down on them.  I only know people who were in the front office, either trading or being maths / comp geeks, in fairness outside of management these are the most well remunerated positions so stress is to be expected.

I moved to London knowing only two people who lived here, so a lot of my friends are people I've met working, since I switched to consultancy work a while back, I've been round to quite a few places, most banks have very different vibes.  Many banks are really a collection of smaller businesses that operate with the same email domain (they aren't under the same roof, share no real infrastructure other than email or phone, half the time, that is heavily segregated!).  For instance last time I was in RBS, I sent a message to a friend without realising he knew the team I was going to be doing some analysis with, my *Like a stripclub on Tuesday night, smells of sadness, despair and they know they aren't the A-team* so yeah that made making friends interesting! (The smart ones did kinda agree, but still the beer was entirely on me for that week).  Others are sometimes vogon grade bureaucratic.  I got paid thousands of pounds once to sit at a desk, without a computer, or a phone, or a pedastil, I wasn't authorised to use my companies equipment, clear desk policy meant I couldn't make notes as I wasn't allowed to take paper off the floor.   However they kindly let me read my kindle.  This was a classic politics, someone was sabotaging someone else's empire, they didn't want me to help fix things, quite insaine.   Other places have made 14 hours of maths I struggled desperately to comprehend fly by.

I guess I am saying it's always different depending on where you are, the firms are huge.  However they often have an overriding vibe, that permeates through them.

They are large, slow and hard to hide making them very vulnerable. Granted, that makes them similar to aircraft carriers - so I suppose something like a carrier battle group could be developed to protect them.
It seems like an inefficient, expensive and vulnerable way of delivering anything at all.

Standard are also winning the Belgian league by 10 points currently, meaning he's played a massive part in getting them there.

There were rumours he was going to move to us in January, but Standard wanted the full amount for him rather than paying in installments (as is normal for transfers). My guess, if that's true, is that they want to sell but also want to win the league, so it had to be a major advantage to them to let go of him at that point in the season.

true,vonbond,null,null,"Hey verisimilite - 

I'm assuming that you will submit an application by October 15 2014 which gives you almost exactly 7 months. I am a bit of an expert on the UK admissions system so do message me for further details and ask any question you have (I mean *any*) and apologies if any of the things I say go over your head.

Number 1: your priority right now, if you are serious about Oxford, is the following: you have to choose between Engineering and Fine Art. Neither is 'better' or 'easier' or 'more worthwhile' but one will suit you better than the other and you know exactly which one that is. I would love to say to you that you could major in one and minor in the other, or even double-major, but at Oxford it doesn't work like that. There are, of course, students who take two subjects, but these are usually closely related, like English and History, or French and English. [Look at this page for a sense of what goes with what](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses/az.html#ae), and I'm afraid that you can't switch it up.

Number 2: Your university experience is going to be COMPLETELY different from any of your peers who stay in the states, and that starts with your application process to British universities. [I'm sure you've already read this but read it again](http://d3upfpng8piaqj.cloudfront.net/UGP%202015%20Applying_Finance_Careers.pdf), and [read this too] (http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/international_students/index.html). This is particularly useful: 
&gt;Admission on academic ability and academic potential alone. We attract many future leaders to Oxford. Our students run numerous extracurricular clubs and engage in community service. But like most U.K. universities, we do not assess our applicants on those characteristics. We select for academic ability and academic potential, as judged by secondary school results (examination results and/or predicted grades), a personal statement, an academic reference and, if required for the subject, an admissions test or written work.

I'm a graduate student at Oxford and it's fucking hard work, I'm just putting it out there.

Number 3: Fine Art at Oxford is brilliant, Engineering at Oxford is brilliant. Every single person who applies for those courses is qualified and/or motivated to do those courses. (obviously there are exceptions...!) Think about what it is about your academic achievements that suit you to Oxford and applying. 

3a. Fine Art is about practical skills and about history and theory. They even say on the website for admissions that having a Foundation Degree (a British, one year degree that prepares you to study Fine Art, where you leave with a degree at higher education level but not at the 'full' bachelors requirement) and/or a BTEC (practical, vocational qualification that takes two years instead of A Levels) are recommended. If you have a burning passion to go to Oxford to study Fine Art, you will in no way be disadvantaged by taking some time out to study art elsewhere. Bear in mind that you can always come to Oxford after these things and know whether it was the right thing for your whole-heartedly.

3b. I know less about Engineering, maybe someone else can jump in here. Engineering is an applied subject, it takes a LOT of work and it can be converted into a four year degree (or five, with a year out in industry but I don't know how it works at Oxford), which gives you an undergraduate Masters degree. 

Number 4: just to be provocative, can I ask you what motivates you to study in the UK? Oxford is NOT the be all and end all of UK undergraduate education (and to be honest, thank God it isn't), and this is a question you may well get asked at interview at any UK university. 'Why Oxford?' 'Why the UK?' are both good starting points to help you really work out what you want. If you want Oxford as a brand-name on your CV, think about why that is important to you, and think about what the things are about the brand that speak to you.

I'm going to stop there for now: feel free to PM or reply and I'll hopefully ask you less irritating questions next time! But seriously: do think really carefully about which subject and WHY Oxford and WHY the UK and then you'll see some light at the end of the tunnel.

Oh and I'd also seriously investigate whether you are on track to achieve the right entrance requirements for either subject and work backwards from there. ",0,1392149016,null,0,false,0,cfcstb2,t3_1scwn5,t1_cfcstb2,t3_1scwn5,null,1432353521,2,false,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,2

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;Salmond told them not to worry about the wind farm

Oh, I thought you were talking about the jobs. Even then, I think it's dubious Salmond work against his own party's policies like that, even with the incentives. Furthermore, Trump have absolutely no proof, and a very bad reputation for underhand tactics.

&gt;Maybe, but what extra information did he have when he started backpeddling that he didn't have when he agreed to the plan?

The knowledge that Trump would then try stop the windfarm, feeling his money and influence would mean the Scottish government would just roll over and agree with him.

&gt;I don't see why this is relevant?

Well it only adds to the likelihood that they made the wrong decision, at the time.

&gt;Or how it can be proven?

I'm not from Aberdeen myself, but have heard some very bad things from people up there. Just recently there was some furor over a badly handled city centre regeneration.

&gt;but if Cameron or Blair or anyone else had happily accepted these extremely generous claims about jobs and investment we'd all be going mad

...would we? How could the public know these figures were generous? Even then, wouldn't even some of the jobs generated have been beneficial?

&gt;I'm sure there could have been some paperwork written up securing a promise that all jobs created would go to Scottish workers, no?

Well then, that's Trump breaking a promise made to the Scottish government, not Salmond falling for an obvious trick. Furthermore, it demonstrates that whoever was in charge of the deal *was* aware of the need for certainty on that front, and not a ""a worrying lack of foresight, intelligence, respect, [or] political nous"".

&gt;Lack of respect

Which could be entirely justified, given Aberdeen City Council's reputation for incompetence, corruption etc. etc.

&gt;he wants his party leading it.

Can you be sure? I feel, above all else, he wants what's best for the people of Scotland. I think it is entirely likely for a man who just fought to give Scots the freedom to choose who leads them, and won, would then respect their decision on who leads them, whoever it was.

&gt;The UK has invested GBP £1.08 billion in development funding for the JSF. Britain has also worked for five years for an ITAR waiver to allow greater technology transfer associated with the project. The effort, backed by the Bush administration, has been repeatedly blocked by U.S. Congressman Henry Hyde because of his concern about potential technology transfer to third countries. On Friday 27 May 2006 President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a joint statement which announced:
&gt;&gt;""Both governments agree that the UK will have the ability to successfully operate, upgrade, employ, and maintain the Joint Strike Fighter such that the UK retains operational sovereignty over the aircraft.""

* he'll promise vast profits in exchange for relatively minor investment
* you end up making vast investments
* he ends up taking the minor profits and fucking off

On the other hand, if you only bother to do half a gnat's fart worth of looking into Donald Trump, you'll only find out one thing:

* he lies like a beast and you shouldn't leave him alone in a room with any 'business opportunities' such as any small change you have or a child holding a lollipop

He knew Trump was opposed tot he farm! That's why Trump had requested promises from Salmond that the farm wouldn't go ahead. That's what Trump is referring to when he says Salmond duped him. 

I don't think Trump was breaking a promise because this worker clause clearly was never written up, again that shows Salmond not thinking of the people in his country. 

You trying to tell me that the leader of the SNP, the champion of independence doesn't want that party to have a crack at the whip when it comes to deciding who runs the country? Come on.

do you know the rate of death in theme parks of the top of your head? can you make a tangible comparison to the rate of death using your toaster, or walking to your car, or using a computer?

do you quantify every single risk you take in your life relative to the benefits, in an objective way, without any error before making decisions? do you think everyone else does?

no, because you aren't omniscient and you aren't a savant, just like the vast majority of people in the UK. The truth is you don't know how dangerous theme parks are, and unless the media reported on it you, and me, and everyone else here wouldn't be any the wiser if the fatality rate started increasing after this guy took charge. 

You don't know every single dangerous and safe chemical that go into your food, which is why the government have health inspectors who *do* who can make the decision for you whether or not something is safe to eat.

You don't know how every single possible car is going to handle every single crash you're going to be in, which is why the NCAP rating system exists and why cars in the UK are MOT tested by experts.

You don't know how to tell every electrical appliance possible is safe for you to use, which is why every electrical appliance that can be sold in the UK has to abide by regulations set, again, by experts.

why would you know which rollercoaster designs out of the infinite possible designs there are for rollercoasters are safe? How do **you**, personally, judge the safeness of the ride you're about to go on? do you ask to inspect every bolt for rust, look at the stress models, etc. and understand all of them? do you personally test the metals used making the ride before you sit in the cart?

No, I don't think a company would *try* to kill its customers. I think a company would *try* to make as much money as possible, and that making money isn't always in the interests of everyone. Is it cheaper to spent 10 million pounds testing every ride, or pay one million in compensation/to guarantee non-disclosure when a cart derails and injures 20 people? Is it cheaper to pay €50M recalling every renault hatchback to fix a brake issue, or pay €5M hiring a team of excellent lawyers to block every claim in court?

1. Yes, the journey between London and N'hampton is commutable. Train takes in the region of an hour and the station seems to be set up for regulars - with live screens showing the status of the tube at the other end, and the train itself terminates at Euston. However, if you're planning on joining one of the big dick firms, I would assume they're all based either in The City or around Canary Wharf (which will add anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour to that journey). And you will get very, very, very tired of that extra leg, very, very quickly - and will probably start to entertain notions of getting yourself a place actually in the city. Not least because the train company will gouge the shit out of you for the pleasure. Which brings me to:
2. I don't know what Northampton has to offer in the way of entertainment, but judging by the shitshow I watched on Saturday, soccer isn't it.

In case this fact slipped by you, everyone is unique, so no one is pretending everyone has the same interests. You seem to be implying that men and women don't have the same interests, which is a huge conversation that frankly I don't think you're educated enough on to speak about, given what you have said so far. I'm also not interested in being the one to educate you, sorry, there is plenty of reading out there.

Those who control the media have a responsibility to be representative of the populations they are reflecting. Panel shows are a perfect example of where the sexism of the industry at all levels has locked out the participation of women in highly visible and completely genderless roles.

I mean, you don't have to believe this, but if you read basically anything about what women have to deal with in the work place maybe you'll start to understand.

I don't have to. Based on my knowledge of amusement parks I can choose whether or not to take a risk. I don't have to be omniscient or a savant. 

&gt;You don't know every single dangerous and safe chemical that go into your food, which is why the government have health inspectors who do who can make the decision for you whether or not something is safe to eat.

So you expect food producers to purposely poison their customers for short term profit, rather than raking in long term money by repeat business. Makes a lot of sense. Without government, we'd surely all be dead from our food.

&gt;You don't know how to tell every electrical appliance possible is safe for you to use, which is why every electrical appliance that can be sold in the UK has to abide by regulations set, again, by experts.

Experts != government. Ever heard of UL listings? Completely VOLUNTARY participation by companies to showcase a commitment to safety and quality.  Stop being obsessed with the idea that only the magical government can ensure quality and safety in our lives. You sound so afraid of the world it's amazing. 

&gt;How do you, personally, judge the safeness of the ride you're about to go on? 

I take a risk based on the reputation of the theme park. If they have problems which are known at a frequency that **I** deem unacceptable, I'll stay home. 

&gt;Is it cheaper to spent 10 million pounds testing every ride, or pay one million in compensation/to guarantee non-disclosure when a cart derails and injures 20 people? Is it cheaper to pay €50M recalling every renault hatchback to fix a brake issue, or pay €5M hiring a team of excellent lawyers to block every claim in court?

And once I know that the company would rather settle out of court than ensure safety, I will stop patronizing them. Vote with your wallet. The ways in which a corporation can get out of responsibility are BECAUSE of the government, not in spite of it. The very idea of a corporation shields actual PEOPLE from facing the repercussions of their actions. I'm not from the UK, so I don't know all the ins and outs of your system, but I assume its similar to the US, in which food companies can bribe the FDA to allow certain amounts of rat feces into our food.

The issue with companies like Flipboard is their future is very unstable. It's hard to gauge the realities of their business when they've been failing to get traction for *years*. Unless you've been working there for at least a year (not just a couple of weeks like your friend did) it's hard to get a sense of those things. It's much easier to get a sense of what a workplace is like if it's a Tier 1 company like Google or Facebook (these tend to put a halo around your career). For companies like Flipboard it's much harder, especially since their success is very dependent on a single (so far unsuccessful, unprofitable) product. I'd be wary of shops like Flipboard that burn through investor cash and don't have a definite future ahead of them.

You're in luck though because if you're a halfway decent Android dev there are a lot of opportunities here in the Bay Area. You should have no problem interviewing, etc.

Anyway we're facing an improving Sunderland side who will be looking to score three points to haul themselves as far out of relegation as possible. I still reckon they'll defend but not park the bus (to try and get us on the counter) and hopefully, with Jovetic, Silva, Navas and Yaya we can get some good link up play in their final third and smash a couple home. Look for us to start defending after a two goal lead so we can rest key players for Saturday. Jovetic and Dzeko will start up front, with Jovetic coming off to be replaced with Kolarov later in the game. Negredo will probably start against Chelsea so it wouldn't surprise me to see him on the bench tomorrow.

Everyone says that but it's a pointless statement as all dogs who *have* attacked are put down. 

&gt;  About 2 people die a year because of dogs. 

And about 5000-6000 attend hospital because of bites. Do you honestly believe that we don't have a problem because of the fact that only around 3% of attacks result in fatalities?

There seems to be a handful of breeds that are responsible for the bulk of serious attacks. Most of these breeds were bred for centuries for violence and there seem to be underhanded attempts to distract from this (e.g. the dropping of ""Bull"" from the name ""Staffordshire Bull Terrier"", given the dogs bull-baiting history). I'm not saying we should be exterminating these dogs but quite frankly I think breeding more of them should be banned. They serve no purpose and are a throwback to a dark part of our past where we forced animals to fight to the death for our enjoyment.

I should say the above comment is what happens on a good day. There are a lot of things which can go wrong and very easily delay you by an hour or more. To make it worse, when things finally do get moving again the trains can be extremely crowded. Like, so full you couldn't physically fit another body in the carriage. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say this happens maybe twice a month (the delay, not necessarily the extreme crowding).

Then once in a while (maybe a few times a year) someone will jump in front of a train. The whole line stops for many hours, as it is initially a potential murder investigation. There is nothing worse than arriving home at 10pm knackered and hungry, knowing you will be up at 6:30am to do the same commute again.

Personally, I quickly found that commuting wasn't for me. But that's just me, plenty of people are fine with it.

As an aside, while the journey from Northampton is usually a little over an hour, there are fast trains from MK which do it in 30mins. Have you considered living in MK instead?

No. That's not how economies work.

If prices of houses increase, the demand for houses decreases. Remember, demand isn't the number of people who want a house, it's the number of people buying houses.

It's microeconomics 101

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_curve

Game theory would indicate a situation where, if anyone builds houses, everyone's profit drops slightly, but if you build houses, your profit increases greatly, that the logical decision for every company to take would be to build more houses. This is why cartels based upon producing less almost instantly fall apart.

The logic you are using here would suggest that the best thing for gold mines to do would be to mine as little gold as possible, but, in reality, the best thing for them to do is mine as much gold as possible because, even though this slightly reduces price per unit, the increased volume of sales makes up for it.",0,1392154662,null,0,false,0,cfcvpo9,t3_1xlsfl,t1_cfcvpo9,t1_cfcj3qi,null,1432354889,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;He knew Trump was opposed tot he farm! That's why Trump had requested promises from Salmond that the farm wouldn't go ahead. That's what Trump is referring to when he says Salmond duped him.

But, I have not see anything to suggest Salmond actually gave any assurances. The fact he actively defended the windfarms being built can be seen a proof of that. It's all very well just to say ""he backpedaled"", but there's only Trump's word that he forward pedalled to begin with!

&gt;I don't think Trump was breaking a promise because this worker clause clearly was never written up, again that shows Salmond not thinking of the people in his country.

Oh, okay, I had thought, from your comment, such a thing *had* be drawn up. But again, unless Trump specifically mentioned that a significant proportion of these jobs would not go to Scots then that is still Salmond being tricked. Easily tricked maybe, but nothing to suggest he simply didn't care that these jobs wouldn't go to Scots. Particularly as the whole reason for wanting the course in the first place was because it would bring in a lot of jobs.

&gt;You trying to tell me that the leader of the SNP, the champion of independence doesn't want that party to have a crack at the whip when it comes to deciding who runs the country? Come on.

If he thinks that's not what's best for Scotland, yes. They said much the same thing at the end of George Washington's presidency, many in the British government were surprised he actually stepped down. 

I think one could be justified of accusing Salmond of being naive, but I'd disagree with saying he did anything dishonest, simply because the only person really accusing him of that is Trump.",0,1392154699,null,0,false,0,cfcvqca,t3_1xlrbi,t1_cfcvqca,t1_cfctuix,null,1432354906,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Nuclear is a variable source of power - there are all kinds of was that a nuclear power station can be prevented from supplying power to the grid, so you will always need backup reserve available to use.

Any power station is not going to be 100% reliable, of course, but arguably nuclear is more predictable/reliable when it is in operation. Wind and solar are not as predictable or reliable and are dependent on available resources.

I'm not sure why you're conflating the two.

&gt; The variability in demand is much greater than the variability in generation from installed renewable energy sources, so there's a long way to go yet before a lack of base load capacity becomes a problem.

Is it not already looking to be a problem? National Grid is already suggesting that we're going to run into issues if we don't get new generation up soon. I'd rather have some whopping nuclear plants making a real difference than some wind/solar plants efficiently converting subsidy into bugger all power output.

&gt; If you want to spend your money on nuclear, be my guest. I'd rather put mine into a community energy coop, that as well as providing clean energy and funding community energy projects offers the potential to provide a decent financial return.

Leicester Uni is one of the top 20 in the country, **defo** better than UEL but the city is rather less ok (as a local I can say that!) I'm guessing you've already checked out the wiki and although it's far bigger than Lawrence, it's one of the smaller UK cities with only ~300k and as such is more neglected than the bigger cities and there is less to do. 

The uni campus is small but nice - the SU and library are pretty awesome and there are lots of international students mostly from China but also get some Erasmus and American students. Nightlife and shopping are ok. It has a **massive** Asian population (and sizeable African/Eastern European communities) so it might be kind of disconcerting but that means plenty of good Indian food. Most importantly the football team is doing great now (and the basketball team is not too shabby either). Also Leicester is very central with good transport links to the rest of the country - London is little over an hour away by train.

Tbh it's not a pretty city, in fact it's pretty damn ugly compared to many other places in the UK, but [it's not completely shit](http://leicesteritsnotshit.co.uk/) and has it's moments. Personally I'd suggest try living in a completely different culture elsewhere in Europe but if you are set on Britain go for it.

true,kvural,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; And I don't think, as portrayed, the Doctor at least would be as comfortable regenerating into a female body as you seem to. He's very human in some ways.

Some ways, yes. In fairness we're talking about a certain level of abstraction where it may not be possible even to know if we meaningfully agree.

Are you familiar with the Classic Series much? The Doctor tends to be much less human and also I think much less invested in his own sexuality and gender identity.

As for the Master...well, I have to say that line is fairly out of character for him (RTD's Master is a fairly haphazard and unfaithful interpretation of the character). The Classic Series establishes him as cruel and insane, but not in any recognizably sexual or gendered sense. He considers all others to be insects in comparison to himself, man and woman alike, save for the Doctor.",0,1392155219,null,0,false,0,cfcvzul,t3_1xlosp,t1_cfcvzul,t1_cfcv460,null,1432355020,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Onto the players, I though Rickie had a poor game. Misplaced passes, poor hold up play. He didn't look right. Looking forward to having Gallagher back to take some pressure off him but obviously he'll come back when he's ready and not before. 

I'm delighted Jack Cork is continuing his good form. Nearly got a goal today and has generally been playing well. Got forward more than I expected which is good to see, and one of him or Morgan were still in the right places to pick up those second balls coming off their long balls to strikers.

This game might have been the game that convinced me that Callum Chambers really can make it at this level. I've been holding judgement on him until now, but tonight he loooked strong in defence and more assured in attack than he has before. Fully deserves his place ahead of Clyne in the team.

Willian looked a lot more confident, and was one of our better players today - had a few decent shots and his passing was a lot better than in previous games.


Glad to see Salah come on as well, would like to see him start games fairly soon, think his pace down the wing will be really useful against teams like City where there is a lot of counterattacking and end to end football.

Yes, but that's to do with the planned closure of a load of old stations in the next few years, coupled with ever increasing energy demand. Any new nuclear plants will take at least a decade to build, if they're lucky. In the meantime, we could have thousands of mid-scale renewable energy installations up and running, coupled with widespread energy efficiency improvements.

Erm, community energy coops aren't meant to supply 100% of the electricity needs of a community, unless it's on a remote island like [Eigg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigg).

Yes but genetic traits last forever. At some point several hundred years ago only the most aggressive and violent examples of these breeds were bred. Then from this base stock the breeding slowly changed to match a changing society, with the more agressive ones being weeded out. But the genetic damage is done, these breeds are forever tainted by their genetic history. These traits are present for millennia, they don't just disappear in a couple hundred years because random mutations happen slowly and the breeding process is so man-made that ""evolution"" has pretty much stopped.

""We dropped too deep in the last 30 minutes; I prefer my teams to defend higher but our defenders were defending in our box and I would have preferred them to be higher up.""

Personally, I did not understand the Mikel sub. Ramires wasn't doing all that well - especially after the knee injury - but with Mikel, it means the defensive line drops deeper and forces the central defenders towards the box. 

Couple it with the Cahill injury and for a few moments before the Baggies' goal the defenders were all at sea. Brana occupied the central slot and suddenly Cahill comes on and Bran a is forced to rush back to a cross he's clearly not going to be able to block. Meanwhile Cahill is still limping and Luiz is unsure of who to mark and in the ensuing confusion, Anichebe gets the slightest of touches with his noggin and scores.

We started the second half brightly but there was no real pressure to score the second and kill off the game - something reminiscent of the pre-December games of this season. We had a few half-chances to kill it off but there never was that good final ball that could have been converted. The over game was quite... lazy.

Oscar should have come off earlier and Willian, for all the pressing and closing down he's capable of, doesn't seem to have a cross or a through ball in his skill set. He is more of a ball recovering winger and an occasional shooter/scorer rather than a proper attacking midfielder, I feel. Sure, he is a great asset at recovering the ball but what help is he when Hazard gets closed out of the game by the opposition?

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said to have left his wife and moved into a new £1.2 million bachelor pad - and now started seeing a younger woman

By Hugo Gye
14:40 11 Feb 2014, updated 20:21 11 Feb 2014

Father-of-two is reported to be seeing ex-Liverpool employee
Neighbours say Mr Rodgers visits the home of Charlotte Hind, 31
Football boss, 41, has whitened his teeth, lost weight and developed a healthy glow
Representative has said Mr Rodgers and Ms Hind are not in a relationship
Mr Rodgers met his wife Susan when he was a young player at Reading
Pair have a son Anton, who plays football for Oldham, and daughter Mischa
Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football.

The 41-year-old has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat.

And he is also reported to have now started seeing a 31-year-old former employee of the club who has been seen at his new property.

Mr Rodgers, a father of two, took over at Liverpool in the summer of 2012 after previously guiding Swansea City into the Premier League.

The move made him one of the most high-profile figures in the football world, a status set to be confirmed when he signs a new contract believed to be worth around £2million a year.

Now Ireland sure as fuck isn't England but the culture is pretty damn close compared to the states. I grew up following Chelsea because of my Dad and his friends and my own friends who were all fans and it's exactly like you said, as kids we would play football in the yard or the park during and after school, we all watched the games, we all wanted to be Ronaldo and most importantly we all supported the national team religiously (I'll never forget that penalty shootout loss to Spain in '02). 

The point is when I moved to the states that culture did not exist *at all*, mostly because there are so many other sports that took priority for people. When I moved here I was the only Chelsea fan I knew, in fact the only other people that were even interested in football were the Latino kids and the other foreign kids. Now fast forward to today and it has become a lot more popular, it's definitely not a niche sport anymore. The problem is, as you pointed out, that very few people have the sport ingrained in their childhood like they do with American football or basketball. So you run into a situation where people are becoming fans of teams but have no reference from upbringing on how to conduct yourself as a fan of both the team and the sport. For the most part it's entirely arbitrary which team they pick; now I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing but what you see happening places (including this board) is backlash from English fans directed towards Americans who stick out like sore thumbs because they just don't know any better. I love seeing support for the team grow but I totally agree how it can be frustrating having to argue with opinions that are clearly based on an entirely different sports culture. Personally it can definitely get on my nerves sometimes since I often get grouped in with the ""American fanbase"", again not saying this is necessarily a bad thing but it definitely affects how you're perceived as a fan, there's no two ways around it.

As the guy in the article said, submarines are almost impossible to detect and we have some of the most advanced attack subs in the world. I think they'd likely make short work of a US aircraft carrier. 

A sub pops up 300KM from the carrier group, launches a few of [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_\(missile\)).. Realistically the carrier doesn't stand much of a chance against multiple targets going mach 3. They're not going to be ready for a few years yet, so we need to keep the Americans happy for now. :P

It might not sink the carrier, but it'd put it out of commission and that's all that's really needed. 

Without the carriers, the US would have to rely on it's B2's but without air superiority they'd all get shot down pretty sharpish.

If we look at PL squads on paper, without really looking closely at the results up to this point, right now Liverpool's doesn't really resemble a very strong team. Consider this: Henderson, Sterling, Skrtel, Cissokho, Mignolet, Kolo, Allen, Enrique, Flanagan, how many champions league squads would these players make? Yet they are all important players for Liverpool but have together only a handful of CL appearances, when u distribute them among the players I've listed.

Many of these players are still young and are building their careers. Remember that Coutinho was at a CL team but wasn't really wanted and was consequently sold. Story isn't too dis-similar to Sturridge's but for obvious reasons we can't put our #15 into any other category but outstanding. I can't see most of the players I've listed be first team in most of the teams that have made the last 32 round this season. For me this is a very important factor and I imagine it is also for many of the experts and pundits.

This team is defying expectation right now. For a large part of the season Suarez was almost dragging us toward wins. Of course the team has at least two other consistently outstanding performers (Sturridge and Gerrard), one of which is the England national captain and one of the top midfielders of the past 15 years or so. Other teams have more experienced performers (and more of them), who are proven to be a lot more consistent (remember we are discussing this in terms of squads written on a piece of paper). How can a team with Rooney, RvP, Ferdinand, Vidic, de Gea, Carrick and even Evra be expected not to make a more credible challenge for top 4 compared to our team (AGAIN ON PAPER!)? Or look at the (supposed) quality Tottenham brought in during the summer ... 100 million pounds worth of players and then some! Yet they are currently 5th, on paper they should be higher, shouldn't they?

The above for me is the key reason, why we aren't considered as genuine title contenders. We lack proven quality and proven consistency. Imho that is the biggest reason we are leaking so many goals, even if (look at things on paper again) our defensive line of Johnson, Skrtel, Agger, Enrique is among the most proven in the PL and arguably in Europe as well (Sakhho should also be added to this list). 

This is why I believe our team is ""young"" right now. This is why our objective is Champions League football. Because then we can build on what our team will have achieved and take it to the next level.

**MATCH FACTS**

**Head-to-head**

Liverpool have won three times as many league meetings (30) as Fulham (10), with 13 draws.

The Cottagers' last home win against Liverpool was in December 2011 when Clint Dempsey's goal proved the difference.

**Fulham**

Fulham have come from behind to draw or win on seven occasions in league and cup this season. (W4, D3)

They have lost 12 of their last 16 league games at Craven Cottage (W3, D1, L12).

Rene Meulensteen's side have conceded a league-high 55 goals this season.

The Cottagers are one of four teams to have a minus goals-to-games ratio in the Premier League (24 goals scored, 25 games played.)

Steve Sidwell needs one more league goal this season (has six so far) to match his entire previous league goalscoring output in two and a half seasons at Fulham.

**Liverpool**

The Merseysiders are unbeaten in six league games (W4, D2).

Liverpool have scored four or more goals in a game on eight occasions this season.

Brendan Rodgers' side have scored the first goal in 19 of 25 league games this season.

Luis Suarez has scored four goals in four Premier League games against Fulham.

Daniel Sturridge scored his only previous Premier League hat-trick in Liverpool's last trip to Craven Cottage, and has netted in each of the last seven league and FA Cup games.

Defensively we've been fortunate that Flanagan and Cissokho have stepped it up, and they will hopefully continue. Injuries have made our defensive a bit rocky, though.

Offensively, looking at our bench, I don't think Aspas, Alberto, or Moses would get in any team above us. Allen is good for more tactical changes, but if we need an extra push, a game changer, none of the 3 mentioned will provide it atm. Therefore showing that our depth is pretty weak.

erm... no they don't.  The .3% state that climate change does not exist.  Get the facts right.  The 99.7% argument is on whether climate change exists or not.  I know climate change exists.  But within that 99.7% are further disagreements on how it's caused.  I saw the debate the other day on the climate change commission.  The minister asked the guy from messechusets a direct question.  ""Can climate change be directly linked to man made emmissions"" and he did everything in his power not to answer it.

&gt; What evidence do you have the.... the positioning of the planets or whatever star sign I was born in can affect the climate.

Did you really ask that?  [source](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/climate-forcing) Milankovich cycles.  

Think logically about this.  Tides.  We have tides every day.  They don't happen by magic.  They occur because the gravitational pull of the moon pulls the surface of the seabed up and down.  The earth orbits the sun, not in a perfect circle, but in an elipse.  The shape of the elipse is called it's eccentricity and it's closest point and furthest point are in constant motion.  We orbit the sun in the same way a hoola hoop does and this is because other planets pull our orbit as we go.  Because our close and far points to the sun have aligned with the summer and winter solstice we have absorbed more energy than usual and the weather events we're seeing in the northern hemisphere are because of that extra heat radiating back into space.  You got to understand that earth acts like a storage heater, not central heating.  It takes a while for things to happen and it takes a while for things to stop so we've got months more of this junk to cope with before equilibrium is restored.  Then it's australia's turn.

Forget about climate scientists.  They have their heads in the clouds.  The proof is in geology.  Core samples prove that earths global climate is in constant flux.  As previously stated Milankovich calculated an ice age occurs every 100'000 years.  The last was about 10-15'000 years ago and geology studies show we have these minor climate shifts every 3-400 years.

You can't stop climate change any more than you can stop the tide, or the wind or the earth spinning. It's a natural part of life and we have to learn to deal with it.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I'm probably not representative of the norm but I'd consider it higher than most traditional outfits (*in my industry at least*). I started my business when I dropped out of college at 18 with most of my friends going to university. Some of them are *still* there, some of them did their degree and couldn't find work so they went back for their masters. I hope it ends with them having excellent careers in interesting places but *so far* all they have to show for it is debt.

In my industry (web development) a piece of paper doesn't mean much, technology moves too quickly and a person who's spent 4 years learning is 6 years behind the curve. I much prefer people who've spent that time working for real clients solving real problems. 

Open University seems in the middle of the two, if you've worked alongside it then you haven't banked your entire future on a piece of paper, you've shown a desire to better yourself and you've followed through with it until the end. You are (in theory) a properly rounded human being who gained a skill. Great employee to have.

I think it's perhaps different in the particularly 'hardcore' subjects, I'm not sure I'd be happy with an open university doctor but in most instances I'd always pick the guy who hasn't just been in school for the last 22 years.

Again though I'm probably not representative of the big corporations and such but there are people out there like me who don't give much weight to the traditional route. Part of the reason I hold this opinion is a family friend who worked as head of IT at a large bank, he would constantly complain about the 'genius' kids he'd get sent who could maybe program a microwave to reroute satellites but couldn't pick up a phone and order a keyboard if their life depended on it.",0,1392163238,null,0,false,0,cfczlil,t3_1xnnzj,t1_cfczlil,t3_1xnnzj,null,1432356785,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

- yes the dog breeds are banned (in fact all of them) have been created - designed - by man via selective breeding. The banned breeds amongst others have been bred specifically to be effective as fighters I.e. For the express purpose for harm.

- no swimming pools have a normal legitimate purpose. Are you really this thick?

- rifles and shotguns are not allowed unless you have a legit reason to have one. Since no-one can think of a (significant) reason that the general public needs a handgun, it's reasonable that they are banned. Guess what, hardly anyone cares that you can't have a handgun.

- the crime stats are a red herring since the ban had general consensus (public is in favour) and reintroduction would serve no useful purpose... Like allowing dangerous dog breeds serves no useful purpose. In an effort to create a safe culture it is a reasonable restriction. The crime stats have been driven by other factors - but just look at the USA for an example of how gun ownership culture had gotten out of control so that no one can fix it I.e. Reduce the quantity of guns in circulation or bring the publics desire for them under control... All the time the murder rate is equiv to a third world country. 

Try to keep a hold of your hyperbole - nobody thinks everything potentially 'dangerous' should be banned, just things that serve no useful purpose outside of their lethal design.

Its a lopsided formation up front allowing eriksen to play more centrally, with defensive cover from dembele and capoue on the left, and adebayor doesnt have to come back deep in our half to pick up the ball. We have 3 midfielders who are very good at dispossessing the other team (capoue,paulinho,dembele) with options ahead for quickfire distribution/counterattacking. Also 2 box-box midfielders (paulinho and dembele) who can bring the ball out from deep. I know its lopsided because eriksen plays more centrally and the way it will work well depends on  the football intelligence of the players to rotate coverage (not lateral swap) but actual counter clockwise and clockwise rotation of the entire defense to deal with attacks from the flank (easier to draw on a chalkboard than explain in text), the team needs to be a smooth unit backing each other up and calling out defensive duties.

I didn't talk about another team, I said it's fortunate that Flano and Ciss have stepped up during our time of need. It's fortunate because things could've gone bad for us, having two players that don't feature much due to injury and skills.

You had my ""argumentation"" in my very first comment. I said that our depth is weak due to the fact that we have no impact players on our bench.

People can use their home to secure a mortgage on BTL property in a really cheap area and do it up, which then also rises because everyone who can is doing the same. So you have the whole obsession with house prices we saw over the last few decades. There was also the council house sell off. And also couples who owned flats they purchased for fuck all who sold them at the right time and used the money to fund a much nicer house (like a few guys I work with). 

And for the people who didn't move, taking out home equity loans to buy toys or improve your property would also make you feel much richer. Even if you didn't do that, just knowing that the house you bought for £30K is now worth £200K would be enough to offset any feeling that your wages hadn't risen properly for years.
