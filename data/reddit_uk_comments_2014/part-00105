Business Cards have definitely been useful, since the vast majority of my new customers are referrals from previous clients,  as I walk out the door on any client I offer them a little stack of 3 or 4 and politely ask that if they're happy with the work that they might consider recommending me.

For when I get a new client and I can 'fix it' there and then *remotely* I obviously can't hand them a card, so instead I generally send them a snail-mail invoice as ""duplicate paper copy for your records"" with a few cards too, even if they request an invoice by email only. 

I also have Outlook attach a signature to all Business emails with my company name, website and contact details but I doubt thats very effective as a marketing tool, it might help for repeat business though I guess.

Edit: crap, sorrey. I just refreshed the thread and saw you were asking about SEO not SME. SEO is ""Search engine optimization"", and it's basically the method of writing your website in such a way that your website appears at or near the top of the results for the kinds of search phrases that you think are going to be common for your target market. (also other shady stuff beyond that, in which I don't partake)

This is a pretty good starter guide IIRC: http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo

He might have burgled other people before, so reporting him might solve other crimes. He might go on to commit more burglaries, because I have spared him prosecution. I would almost be an accessory to those crimes.

Maybe his employer deserves to know that he is a thief?

Moreover, he has received favourable treatment simply because he has a spare £20K to give me.

The different names given to this payment from time to time reflect the current social attitude to those who receive it.

**Welfare**: When the whole concept of the welfare state was born out of the mass poverty generated by the industrial revolution, the subsistence paid in money or in kind to those in need took the name: welfare. This is still the generic name by which it is universally known. I believe that in other countries this basic survival payment is known by other names. The most universal is, however, still welfare, but bearing in mind its miserly magnitude, I cannot imagine anybody ever faring well on it!

**The 'Social'**: When I first became unemployed this payment was commonly known as Social Security, or colloquially simply as the Social. It was viewed as a safety net against destitution. It reflected an attitude that every human being should be protected from starvation and homelessness. As such, anybody who was deemed to need it received it.

**Income Support**: Later the name of the state subsistence payment was changed to Income Support. The idea was that everybody, no matter who they were or whatever their means, was obliged to try to obtain an income through their own initiative. However, if the free-market worth of their labour were not sufficient for them to subsist, then the state would top it up or support it with an extra payment. The attitude of society-at-large was that everybody needed - and should by some means receive - an income sufficient for the purpose of sustaining their lives. However, in my case, as I suspect for most, the term 'support' was a misnomer. It did not merely support my income: it was my income.

**Job-Seeker's Allowance**: Later still, the name was changed again to Job-Seeker's Allowance. This reflected a hardening of social attitude. This name implied that everybody had an obligation to find paid work and that the payment was specifically to meet the expenses of seeking that paid work. If any recipient found himself for any reason unable to convince the relevant authority that he was actively seeking work then the payment was stopped. It reflected the hardening attitude that if one were not seen to be seeking paid work - for any reason - then one had no right to live.",0,1397427814,null,0,false,0,cgrlgy9,t3_22yeaa,t1_cgrlgy9,t3_22yeaa,null,1435495623,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

Downside: drama. As with any industry I guess, but when it's your business the drama is a right ball ache.

The definition of poacher you're referring to only came about post-football manager. Someone like Suarez would not fall into that category of poacher even though he's lethal inside the box simply because he does not just hang out around the box, unlike someone like Van Nistelrooy, and also contributes to a hell of a lot assists. But in the traditional definition, calling him a poacher would be perfectly acceptable because he scores a lot of goals. And in all his years at the top, I never read a single article describing Van Nistelrooy as a poacher, even though he'd be the text book cover boy for that term. Hell, it even took Football Manager something like 18 years to come up with their own interpretation of a poacher.

I think its common sense to say that whoever has the most points deserves it but that had nothing to do with what I said.

I also liked how you ignored Man City and talked about Liverpool's goals conceded. You do understand that they have a higher goal difference then us right? I would much rather win a game 5-2 playing exciting football then win 1-0 playing scrappy.

Back to my original point. You should play the style that best gives you the chance of winning. Playing expansive, exciting, tiki taka, whatever the hell you call it, is the best way to be a successful top team these days. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Dortmund (in their successful seasons), Man City, Liverpool, PSG, Juventus. Basically every top team in the globe plays this style one way or another. 

You can't ignore the facts, almost every trophy in recent time has been won with this style. You definitely have the odd wins here and there but a huge majority have been won with possession based football. You also seem to have this assumption that when playing expansive you can't grid out wins 1-0...You can grind out football matches playing in any way, but when you grind out a result when playing expansive football its just more possession then normal plus a very patient build up. Grinding out a result is universal to all styles of football. And if you consistently have to grind out matches to win you have underlying problems you have to fix. Do you honestly think that Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid have never grinded out results? They do it, but they dont have to do it anywhere near as frequently as we do.

LvG's Dutch. It's just what they do because a Dutch 4-3-3 pretty much laid the groundwork for tiki-taka and possession ball. If you've ever seen a Barca game, look at how deep all of the front three are playing at. It's insane for their position of forward. 

&gt;I'm not calling bentaleb a bad player, but how can you say he deserves a place in the squad over holtby?

Because Bentaleb is a better DM than Holtby in DM. Holtby could probably start over in the box to box role over Dembele, but no way are we putting him as our 6. That's of course, Holtby has played as DM ever, which I'm not sure he has. The guy was made for either an attacking mid or box to box role. 

If anything, this is how we'll line up next season. It takes into mind everyone's strengths and weaknesses.

http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=2ky7p

tl;dr-Holtby's not a DM by any metric.

&gt;

&gt;__Rochester__ is a town and former [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom) in the [unitary authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authority) of [Medway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medway) in [South East England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England). It is at the [lowest bridging point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_bridging_point) of the [River Medway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Medway) about 30 miles (48 km) from London. The town was for many years the favourite of [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens), who lived nearby at [Gads Hill Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gads_Hill_Place), [Higham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higham,_Kent), and who based many of his novels in the area. The [Diocese of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Rochester), the second oldest in England, is based at [Rochester Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Cathedral), and was responsible for the founding of [King's School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_School,_Rochester) in 604 AD, which is the second [oldest school in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_schools_in_the_world). [Rochester Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Castle), built by [Gundulf of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundulf_of_Rochester), has one of the best preserved keeps in England or France, and during the [First Barons' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barons%27_War) (1215–1217) in King [John's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John,_King_of_England) reign, baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop [Stephen Langton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Langton) and held it against the king, who then besieged it. 

&gt;Rochester, together with neighbouring [Chatham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham,_Kent), [Gillingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillingham,_Kent), [Strood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strood) and a number of outlying villages, makes up the [Medway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medway) unitary authority area. It was, until 1998,  part of [Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent) and is still [ceremonially associated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England) via the [Lieutenancies Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenancies_Act_1997).

Nothing that I'd rate, more fluffy stuff like how wonderful ""fibre optic broadband"" is if you get it from shit isps like talktalk.

&gt; I would summarise what I've learnt but my head hurts. Trying to work out why my BT exchange, which is right by my house, is marked as green/accepting orders on openreach[1] but no providers are offering a 'superfast' product

Because (and BT really shouldn't make their checker operate like this) FTTC is dependent on if your local cabinet has had a fibre one installed nearby and connected to it, FTTP is dependent on whether the underground pit or overhead pole has had the fibre installed on it. The openreach site actually says ""accepting orders"" for an exchange when there's only one cabinet/street/whatever that has been upgraded.

So in your case, it's possible that your cabinet/street hasn't been upgraded and that's why no one will sell you it. Another option but less likely is that the cabinet is full so they can't sell it to you.

If you're very lucky, it may be that you can get FTTP and the ISP you are looking at isn't selling it. The BT website will sell it to you if it is available. http://www.dslchecker.bt.com/ is good too.

&gt; Just presume in a Virgin Media area it's not worth it for them. 

If anything it might mean it's more likely, without FTTC or FTTP they can't begin to compete with Virgin. I don't live in a Virgin area, but the nearest place that does has BT fibre cabinets everywhere.

&gt; Not worked this out yet, but do the different BT Infinity 1 &amp; 2 packages (38/9.5mbps and 76/19mbps) relate to FTTC and the BT Infinity 3 &amp; 4 (200/20 &amp; 300/20mbps) are FTTP (where available. it's hard to get the BT site to show Infinity 3&amp;4)

Yes, that's pretty much it - however Infinity 1/2 will be FTTP too if you live somewhere that has it. They don't install FTTC and FTTP in the same place, it will be one or the other for your area (by street, typically)

The BT site will show you FTTP options if your phone number / address is deemed to be in an FTTP area. I think you can add something like &amp;fttp=yes to the URL and it will show up too.

&gt; All all things considering, the fastest Virgin Media package doesn't seem too bad? (152/12Mbps)

It depends if you can deal with the limitations of Virgin - stuff like not having a static IP address, not great technical support, the fucking shite superturd, and how good the local network is in your area (152Mbps sounds nice but not if you can't actually ever get that speed because of congestion from other users). If so then it's a good choice.

If you're lucky to live in a BT FTTP area there's no question, it's simply the best thing out there right now.",0,1397431460,null,0,1397431684,0,cgrmy2t,t3_22sx3p,t1_cgrmy2t,t1_cgrmivo,null,1433341290,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So, because all this has been discovered it's very fresh in the media and in the minds of people in Liverpool. Also it's the 25th anniversary this year so it's a bit of a milestone.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"You'll get over it eventually. I'm freelance web design and I also help run a forum for web designers (Pop along, http://thewebdesignforum.co.uk) and charging/contracts/chasing up is *usually* the biggest worry people have. 

My main tips are;

1.) Charge more.

-- It seems counter intuitive, you want more work through the door why would you price some clients out? The reality is you are pricing some clients *in*. The people you already have can probably pay more and they will if you do good work. The people you *don't* have might have contacted you for a quote and assumed certain things based on the answer. 

Pick a few inquiries at random, come up with your usual quote and increase it by 50%. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the reaction.

2.) Say no more often.

-- Scope creep, small projects, old clients, mates rates.. **don't do them**. You are one person with an in demand skill and you only have so many hours in a day. I guarantee you that you have clients who have more work on bigger projects they could send you but they don't because you keep filling your day with all the little ones they need done.  They don't know you do big jobs.

Next time a regular comes along wanting a little holding page here or a blog theme there tell them you are booked out for a little while and can only schedule big jobs at the moment. Obviously say you'll be happy to help in 5/10/15 days but don't just jump on everything they offer.

3.) Always appear incredibly busy even when not.

-- You are a *business*, not a person, and as such you need to market yourself but it's not all about cold calls and banner ads. You need to put out a certain brand image and it should be one of an in demand expert, a person worth a pretty penny. Humans are simple creatures, if you tell them lots of people are banging on your door wanting to throw money at you.. they'll join in.


4.) Find a way to be more confident about 1 &amp; 2.

-- Maybe you don't like talking numbers over the phone, switch to telling clients you'll go away and come up with a quote and email them it. You can be more confident in email. Or maybe it's the other way around. Whatever it is you have to find a way to block out the negatives aspects and deliver the information you need to. Don't worry about the consequences, don't worry about what they might think and don't worry about rejection. Put the figure out there that you *deserve* and good things will happen.

You should not be friends with your clients and **you are not their lackey**. You agree up front what the job to be done is and what the fee will be, you do the job *as described* and you get paid. No less, no more. Changing a button colour or a font here and there is fine but if some little email drops into your inbox asking for something that would take more than an hour? *""That feature was not in the agreement, I can't do that under our current contract/price but once this job is complete I'd be more than happy to work with you on making it happen.""* 

Here's the secret.. when people ask for things they don't actually expect to get them. They don't *know* what to expect. **You are the expert**, you dictate the terms, it's your contracts they signed so you need to be the one to tell them how everything is going to go. Really what they are looking for is communication and guidance so again it's about showing them you've been there/you've done it/you know the ropes/you'll lead the way.  (*This slightly changes when dealing with large business because they tend to deal with freelancers all the time.. those jobs you generally just put up with their shit and make sure you pad the bill to accommodate the endless meaningless emails.*)",0,1397434583,null,0,false,0,cgro7xf,t3_22y4pf,t1_cgro7xf,t1_cgrndxa,null,1433341889,57,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,57

The trousers and shirt are passable, but the cravat is grey on the actual costume, the waistcoat is also more grey.

We absolutely cannot defend this poorly against Chelsea, they rarely concede more than one so it'll be tight.

They are very difficult to stop because of their pace and movement.

 I'm not entirely sure how we'll approach it, because we need to win and so do they but I can't see them taking the game to us. They'll press high and keep it tight, we'll struggle to score if we aren't on it from the first whistle. We'll need to protect the defence from counters, especially in wide areas.

Hopefully Hazard doesn't make it back in time, and Atletico will test them to the limit midweek so they might not be 100%.

true,FaggotCaterpillar,BR,brazil,"Note: I couldn't watch most of the game, so I can only speak about the last 20 or so minutes that I did catch.

Salah's problem wasn't that his finishing was poor, it was that he wasn't trying to finish at all. In the little bit of the game that I was able to watch, he got maybe 3 or 4 great chances to shoot. One or no defenders in front of him, on his preferred left foot, inside the box.... They were perfect scenarios and I'm confident he would have scored at least one if he had tried.

His problem was that each time he was in a great position to shoot, he would hold the ball for a little bit too long and then try to pass it through some defenders to someone marked on the other side of the box. Most of the time the pass would be slightly too short, or off, or be intercepted by a defender.

And he isn't the only one doing this. I've noticed this with plenty of our attackers. Hazard, as amazing as he is at passing and dribbling, doesn't take some shots that you would expect top goalscorers to attempt. Oscar and Willian are great at getting/passing into the box, but once there their mind just seems to go blank and they hesitate too long when they could have shot instead. Eto'o and Torres also don't shoot nearly as much as they should when presented with a good opportunity. 

The only players who seem to have that coveted ""goalscorer's instinct"" are Ba, Schurrle, and Lampard. When they get in the box they are only thinking about scoring. Sure they might miss some shots, that's normal, but if you'll never score if you don't shoot.

Not to mention that the Doctor said that he couldn't go back and save them because the streams were too tangled. Maybe there's a chance that there are two versions of Rory in the past.

It will tell you where to not go.

That said I've walked through Sandy Row after the sun went down with an Irish name and a southern accent and lived to tell the tale. I'll admit though that the lads with hoodies and covered faces that one time were a little intimidating. But stay out of those places and you won't have to worry.

Though if you do wander in and someone asks your name you aren't legally obliged to give them your actual name. Make up the most protestant sounding name beforehand and so long as your accent isn't southern like mine it should be pretty convincing like.

(From the linked article:)

&gt;But what really puzzles me are the two inflection points that start Phases II and III. Why would Villas-Boas abandon a system that had produced such excellent defensive results? Why would he tell the midfielders to back off their ball-pressure precisely when the back four needed their help the most? Did he misinterpret the Newcastle loss as an indictment of his system rather than a crazy anomaly? Did he lose the players and find himself unable to coax out of them the defensive effort that they had previously given? My working hypothesis is that it was mostly a dumb overreaction, combined with problematic man-management that lost control of the squad.
  
IMO the cries for ""Playing the Tottenham way!"" were a driving force to change tactics so drastically. Spurs were winning gritty defensive games, and even had their highest point total ever (at that current point in the season). The calls for more ""attacking football"" in the vein of the ""Tottenham Way"" were being heard and, feeling like he was losing the public and possibly the team, he tried to appease the fan base and keep his job.

Second of all, it's not very classy to root against a team simply for the sake of them losing. I'll prove it to you: if you were to meet OSU in the Big 10 Championship, would you rather them be 10-4 or 14-0?

Still planning on upping the amount of work I do as a guitar teacher. Want to get it up to 20 lessons a week by the end of the year.

It's only ever hard when students are easily distracted or actually maybe not that interested in actually learning. Some kids get pushed into it by parents, or think it will be easier than it is.

&gt;

&gt;In the United Kingdom, the song's most successful [cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version) was released by [Gerry and the Pacemakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_and_the_Pacemakers) in 1963, after the band's producer [George Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin) suggested that they record it as a follow up to their hit ""I Like It,"" peaking at number one in the singles chart for four consecutive weeks.

&gt;The song quickly became the anthem of [Liverpool Football Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and is invariably sung by its supporters moments before the start of each home game.  The words ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" also feature in the club crest and on the Shankly Gate entrance to [Anfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield), the home stadium.

&gt;According to former player [Tommy Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Smith_(footballer_born_1945\)), lead vocalist [Gerry Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Marsden) presented Liverpool manager [Bill Shankly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shankly) with a tape recording of his forthcoming cover single during a pre-season coach trip in the summer of 1963. ""Shanks was in awe of what he heard. ... Football writers from the local newspapers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind between games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had adopted Gerry Marsden's forthcoming single as the club song. ... Little wonder, then, that having been endorsed by Bill Shankly and the players it was so readily adopted by the [Kop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spion_Kop_(stadiums\)).""

I bolded the top players in each position. I know it is up for debate, and in some positions (like RB) I thought the answer was very up in the air. I am biased, but I tried to keep as fair as possible. I also italicized the weakest of each category, if there was an obvious weak link, and simply subtracted the italics from the bold to get a number for each team. Very imperfect but it gave me something to do for the past half hour. I also realize each team plays a different system so it isnt fair to compare them like this (Everton and Arsenal, for example, play with several CMs that rotate between CAM and CDM). Also, remember we are talking about ""on paper"" how these teams are, so someone like Ozil will be overrated by nature.

As far as I am concerned, Arsenal is probably a little better than us on paper, but not significantly.

**Tenth Doctor:**

* In ""Fear Her"", when Rose is joking about bratty children, the Doctor says ""I was a father once.""
* In ""The Doctor's Daughter"", the Doctor explains that he was a father before, and looking at Jenny reminds him of deep sense of loss he feels because he's lost everything, including his family.


I'm sure I'm missing other references - and that there may be references that disprove (as much as anything on Who is disproved) the thought, but the implication is that he's lost his family, he's been a father, and maybe, even, that they were on Gallifrey.

Thanks for the compliment, and why did he do this? Oh right, because it was 0-0.

I was also begging for a 4-1-4-1 system which has happened multiple times on the field, you can't have two strikers in a 4-1-4-1, so what's your point? Yes I love two strikers playing, and it's happened multiple times, I never insisted we start with two or always play with two.

&gt;He did the same against PSG, but of course you claim his subs are poor, and bemoan his lack of creativity. 

Creativity has nothing to do with basic substitutions, any other Manager who makes a substitution is just doing his job, but when Mourinho makes a substitution, he's a creative, tactical genius, right?

true,YankshireRose,eng-durham,Durham,"Caterer here, based in the north east.  We cater events, trade at markets and festivals.  We're catering our first couple of weddings this summer, which is really exciting for us.  Money is OK.  Our business is largely seasonal, as we serve barbecue (chimichurri, mango-chilli chicken) cooked over a charcoal grill or cooked in a smoker, fresh sides, all assembled on site in front of the person, all made from scratch.  We've been exploring ideas on how to make our business go year round in a more consistent way.  We've been trading for a year and a half, so it's still early days yet.  On the plus side, we're building trade fairly consistently.  At the moment, we've needed part-time jobs and other little things we do to keep a roof over our heads in the winter months. I'm hoping we'll have enough consistent trade to allow us to focus on the business full time, year round.

Good things about it: love cooking, love the banter with our customers, feel real pride about what we've built and the product we sell.  Love that it's a growing business, as well.  Am really lucky that my partner and I compliment each other in the business (he has the gift of the gab and is a terrific negotiator, I'm the contracts and tax and paperwork person)

Downsides: it will eat your life if you let it.  You need to develop skills to manage your time in a way that helps you get work done, but to also have a life outside of the business.  There are times when my partner and I have difficulty switching off the business so we can just hang out as a couple.  We've tried to manage this by scheduling formal business meetings, complete with minutes and agendas, so we have a place to talk about business stuff, so we can talk about other things when we're outside the meetings or our actual work time.  Marketing is a bitch, but it's completely necessary.  Business plans, too, and budgets and financial projections. If you can't do these things for yourself, pay someone who can help you do this.

CB in.

One of the central midfielders out (pauly, dembele, or siggy).

Ideally a young star striker also in, but that would be luxury.

Quite frankly, the squad is fine and all we really need is a manager with a plan. I think our squad could work with a 442, 433, 4231, 3511, 3241, 4222, 3421. Really a lot of different players at the disposal for whoever comes in.

I personally would love to see this line up:

Hugo

Kaboul Daws SuperJan

Walker Sandro/Capoue Paulinho/Bentaleb/Dembele Townsend

Lamela Eriksen

Soldado or Ade

EDIT: Essentially a 3-4-2-1 where the 2 play both play as hybrid forwards/#10's. Sandro/Capoue would obviously need to be disciplined and help break down counters and the outside mids would have to be mindful of the other's position and help the defense shift into a 4 back system when players are caught up field. I think this line-up would be much better with vlad in daws position, but I just don't trust that he is focused 100% on the field yet, and that is a must for that spot.

Hazard is our best player, of course Mourinho is going to rely on him, especially considering it's a young squad, still developing. The PSG game shows how other players are starting to take responsibility, and that will be even more true next season. Getting a proper striker will help too - Hazard has had to step up to compensate. 

Mourinho was right about Mata. We made a nice sum off him, and have gone from strength to strength since he left. He has looked lost at United, and has not been able to save their season.

true,mrandocalrissian,null,null,"&gt;What I will say, and maybe people who live in Wembley or spend time in the Regent's Park area of central London (which is where a lot of fans seem to congregate before the game) will agree is that the crowd is made up of a surprisingly large amount of people from mainland Europe. We see them everywhere at work, especially Germany and Scandinavia. People will make the trip to England to watch the NFL.  They don't even always follow the teams who are playing, you see significant numbers of jerseys of pretty much every NFL team in the crowd. 

Came in to point this out.  I have been to most of the NFL Wembley games and have followed the sport for about 13 years.  Whenever I go to Wembley for a game, I am always happy to see how many Europeans are there - but also Americans and Canadians.  London has a huge resident population of Americans and Canadians, but also there are so many Americans living in places like Germany, often retired or serving servicemen.  The Wembley games are not just about offering NFL to Brits; they give a chance to a huge European based market of many nationalities.

And no, you don't have to be married. Take a look at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/privaterent/government/laguidancepdf which states later on:

&gt; 2.1.7 The definition of “family” is set out in full in section 128 of the 2006 Act.
&gt; The definition includes married, unmarried and same-sex couples and
&gt; stepchildren and foster children, as well as certain close blood relatives.

We then looked further into it and clarified this definition with the local council and the general rule seems to be ""If you sleep in the same bed you count as one"".

Not all landlords will agree with this definition, but they are wrong and haven't spend as much time looking into this. There is also a lot of wrong information about this on the internet which means that landlords are just as confused about this question as their prospective tenants.

It's a fun job, you get to know a lot of people, it's challenging, and it keeps you fit, but it is a bit remote and can be pretty hard on your body- cold wind will chap your skin, you need to invest in some decent boots etc.

Other downsides are:

- having to report tax stuff, that's a ball ache

- it's not guaranteed regular income, so if a customer ditches you it can be a bit aargh for a while

- your income peaks and troughs over the year. For me Sept and Jan are super busy, whilst quite frankly I might as well take the whole month of August off

- as you get older looking towards other life stages, you need to start planning to save for pension and maternity stuff as all you will get is the state minimum which tbh is fuck all

Longer term I might study to do dog training/behaviouralist stuff, as that is pretty trendy and has £££ earning potential right now.

I am not a doctor, but an Optician with some interest in DVLA driving rules (I work for an approved contractor and do some extra tests if the DVLA require them, I can fill in parts of an M1 form). 

There is a list of [notifiable conditions](https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving) that you need to tell the DVLA about. They roughly fall into two categories:

1. Those that you MUST tell the DVLA about. No ifs, no buts. You don't tell them and it's a £1000 fine, plus your insurance is usually invalid, plus if you are involved in an accident you can be prosecuted separately as a criminal offence.

2. Those that you must tell the DVLA about IF IT AFFECTS YOUR DRIVING. There is a little leeway in this, but the DVLA usually expect you to have discussed driving with your consultant. If it affects your driving and you haven't notified them penalties are the same as the above. 

Depression falls into the second group of conditions, it is only considered *if it affects your driving*. 

The DVLA issue a document, ""At a glance guide to the current medical standards for fitness to drive for medical practitioners"" (nothing *at a glance* about it, blasted thing runs to about 70 pages plus annexes, supporting documents and addendums, and is the bane of my existence some days), on depression it says that they are specifically looking for ""significant memory or concentration problems, agitation, behavioural disturbance or suicidal thoughts"", so from your OP, looks good. 

As to medications and drugs, the DVLA is looking to see that you aren't suffering from issues with ""alertness, concentration and driving performance"", but again, looks like you're in the clear on this one. 

If you have concerns, I have the number 03007906806 scribbled on the front of my copy of ""At a Glance..."", I'm 99% sure its the number for medical queries, they answer my questions and I've been giving it to patients, so give them a ring. You can also chase your medical up with the DVLA on their website somewhere, but I'm not sure where. 

Its worth noting that your doctor has very little sway over whether you can continue to drive or not. We are advised not to comment on whether a patient can/should continue to drive, only where they should/must notify the DVLA, as ultimately the decision lies with the medical officer in Swansea, however anecdotally the DVLA tend to be relatively permissive, I've had a number of patients come and thank me for passing them, when if it were up to me I would have taken their licence (but thankfully it isn't up to me).

I was first in the door at the council office designated for such work and was the first seen. A man not much older than myself was taken aback. A young man, tired but clean and well dressed was before him. Not a grubby teen in tracksuit bottoms and Nike Air Max trainers.

I explained my situation, a good fifteen minutes of the last five years of my life. I finished and he asked if I would like some water. When he returned an older woman was with him, reading some notes he had taken.

""I'm sorry Mr Johnson but your in a grey area. Normally in this situation we would put you up with a relative and pay for some rent but as you have no family we do not have that option. Our other option would be to home you ourselves but because you are a student we cannot do that - if you could sit in the waiting area I will go and see if there's anything we can do""

This woman was clearly angry and upset that she had nothing more. As I picked up my bag the young man asked ""Did you say you went to Wilberforce (one of the local colleges)?""

""Yes""
""Did you do IT there?""
""Yes""
""My Mum might have taught you, Mrs X""
""Yeah, both years""

An hour of waiting goes by and it appears to be a normal day. A steady stream of societies lowest rung wander in and out, arguing over benefits, housing and other concerns.  The woman returns in tow of a man in a sharp grey suit. 

""Hi, I'm Councillor X. I'm one of the representatives on the Council. Thank you for waiting. We've had another look at helping with your case but I'm afraid in this situation there is nothing we can do for you. All we can recommend is you put yourself into a hostel, which will be £68 a night"".

""Thats more than I earn a week"".
""Im sorry Mr Johnson""

Dismayed I thanked then for there time and made to leave. As I reached the door a taxi pulled up and the younger man called out dashing forth. 

""I called my Mum, she knows someone at the University. They are sending one of their student support staff in to meet you. This taxi is for you, its already paid. Good luck"".

That night I was in my new room at a University owned house, clean safe and well dressed but I very nearly found myself on the streets.

true,wax_addict,uk,"Newport, Wales","Yeah that's pretty typical, although usually it's double for a first clean. Reason being it takes at least twice as long to do and they're a nightmare at times, especially if you're a good cleaner and get everything perfect, sills,  panes etc.. After that it's mainly just maintaining them.

Personally I charge the same for a first clean as every other, reason being the customer feels like they've got a deal once I explain most charge although I don't, and the repeated business is worth more than an extra few quid. That said, sometimes I've wished I charged, I spent 3 hours on a first clean when I was starting out.

Another thing to take into account is the traditional vs water fed pole methods. Wfp is that big brush hose thing on the end of a pole. People use them because they're quicker (more house, more money) and they don't need ladders. Downside is they don't clean as well as traditional and it can damage older frames and sills with water seepage, especially older wooden ones.

Traditional is squeegee and ladders which gets a beautiful clean if done properly. I'm traditional, which is harder and slower work but the outcome is arguably better and people seem to prefer it. At least half of my customers have cancelled their wfp guy/company to go with me traditionally.

Price wise, it depends on the area but typically we charge a quid a window, standard sorta windy cost gauge. Not every window but like living room, front bedroom etc.. Big bays or awkward windows a little more. A typical 2 up 2 down should cost 7-10 quid for instance.

If you don't fancy paying loads for a certain guy/company just look around. Also it's not uncommon to charge extra if you're having quarterly cleans etc. But bi-monthly shouldn't matter too much. You're the customer btw, you decide the terms, if they don't like it then just find someone else who does.

I'm still here waiting really, I received another letter from them this weekend to inform me they received my medical information and are reviewing it which ""may take at least 12 weeks to be reviewed"".

At first I wasn't going to mention anything during my medical because it doesn't effect my driving or any sort of concentration. I've been on them for some time and any form of possible side effect that is possible, I just don't get. (Unless you include them making me feel normal :)). 
My doctor advised me to inform them just to be on the safe side. Once she had filled out the medical form she discussed it briefly with me before sending it off. Obviously with no side effects, especially those of which could affect my driving, the boxes were just ""No"" all over.
I have been sitting here contemplating giving them a ring, as I have employment waiting on my license, but the latest letter is dated Wednesday last week. I can be quite impatient with waiting, knowing it ""may be at least 12 weeks"". I'm also not entirely sure how long the employer will wait.

To a certain extent I regret informing them, as I have no underlying side effects, but I was advised to do so as a ""just in case"" precaution sort of thing.
I read somewhere that if it's a longer-standing illness that lasts more than 3-6 months then they need to be informed.

If your company takes £100,000 of stock and converts it into £1,000,000 of sales your company has added £900,000 of value.

If your company has 10 staff, that's £90,000 GVA per head. If the staff work 40 hours per week, that's near enough 20,000 hours worked in the year, so that's £900,000/20,000 = £45 GVA / hour worked.

It's nothing really to do with what you're actually paid. You can break it down further and say, with 9 employees we would have made £950,000  sales (and £95k COGS), so the 10th employee was only worth £45,000 GVA, so you can use that to say that different employees are worth different amounts.

Though the reason the measurement used is a bit misleading in this case is because it's looking at the GVA of London as a whole, and dividing it by the population of London as a whole.

You stay on your feet, it looks like you've just mis-controlled the ball and the attack is over, despite you actually being fouled, or you make the most of it, fall over and are more likely to get the free kick.  Unfortunately referees are now used to players falling over at the slightest touch, so they expect it and thus are unlikely to give anything if you don't go down.

A case of mesmerising everyone with the ""Oooh, shiny new thing!"" argument, so that they don't notice it's just a reason to distance the Health Service and GP's who think they're too good to see patients - or GP's who are so inundated with paperwork and fund management that they can't afford the time to see patients properly.

Take the example ~~C~~Hunt gave of the elderly lady who can hit a button and be talking to someone in an emergency.

OK, that's all very well, but here's an example from my own life: My SO's 93 year old grandfather is in sheltered accommodation. Every room has a red pull cord which, when activated, sends a medical professional speeding to the rescue...only because of cutbacks, it doesn't. It makes a light blink in the warden's office and eventually someone will show up - or more likely, a relative will receive a phone call.

And then, there's the fact that he doesn't *want* to pull the cord. he's a cantankerous old goat who would rather lie in his own piss and shit just to make a point. I'm not being cruel, this is genuinely how he thinks. You don't know him, so don't judge.

To make that call, the elderly person has to be 

* Able to reach the button
* Capable of speech
* Clearminded enough to articulate what the problem is in a way that enables the GP to make a diagnosis.

It's *very* rare that yer average octogenarian will be capable of this. hell, I know 20-somethings who are barely capable of describing what they just had for dinner, let alone what's wrong with them.

How much would this scheme cost? Would it cost more or less than the cost of staffing sheltered accommodation adequately so that when an alarm goes off, something useful happens?

How many GP's do you know who would make a solid diagnosis over the phone? How will internet communication make that any better? How many GP's would make a diagnosis over text?

And what about the fact that not everyone has the internet at home? Are we to pop down to our local library to use the computers there, just to book an appointment with the GP? Oops, can't do that, they closed all the Libraries.

WWII: Happened over half a century ago with 50+ million deaths, both in battle and in concentration camps. One of the most popular joke topics amongst people, ""Nazi that coming... Anne Frankly... etc"". Tributes getting progressively less common and adhered to.

Celeb deaths: Happen every year. Jokes and puns immediately follow. No tribute because its only one families problem.

Heysel: Happened less than 30 years ago. Caused by Liverpool fans. Small tributes in Italy, no real mention of it by Liverpool because it wasn't their fans who died. Jokes amongst elder Liverpool fans fairly common, almost every scouser has the ""they had too many people in the wall"" joke in their arsenal.

Hillsborough: Happened less than 30 years ago. Premier league structure altered every year around that time since. Liverpool fans across the world deem it a subject untouchable by anyone who doesn't support the club. No jokes or else Career/Political/Social suicide. Tributes every year. Fights, abuse and beatings for anyone who doesn't care as much about it as Liverpool fans do. Death threats en masse for anyone who speaks out of line about it. Biggest disaster in the history of the world.

The reason it has so much coverage is because Liverpool fans are so egocentric that suffering outside of their own circle means fuck all to them.

As I understand it, investigations are allowed to take up to 90 working days, where they will contact your GP/consultant, or ask you to see an independent doctor or other medical professional to gather further information. It sounds like this is the most likely option in this case. Phone the DVLA and see if there is anything you can do to speed things up (like harass your GP to get the paperwork sent back, receptionists tend to hoard these forms and dump them all in a massive pile in one go). 

If it has gone to a review panel, they meet twice a year and are usually a group of consultants/experts in a particular field, plus a number of lay members.

true,ilofty,eng-lincolnshire,In the shire!,"OK. Going by the cheapest for an iphone

£30/pm for 24 months + maybe £27 for the phone too. That's a total of £747.

For £50/pm and no upfront cost you're looking at £1200. No iPhone is worth that. 

Brand new, to buy for a PAYG sim, iPhones are anywhere from 400-500£. Then when the new one comes out it will cost you about 300 if you sell your old one. 

And don't forget about topping up! 

I have an s3, £35 a month on 3, unlimited everything and free tethering, it's called the one plan I'd recommend it. I'm happy to pay way over price for the phone and contract because I know it's going to cost me a flat £35 a month. No over charges. 

You will NOT find a deal like that anywhere on both contract and PAYG. 

So please, keep telling everyone how you're not over paying for your phone and contract. Because the lumia isn't worth a total of £700+ over 2 years. No device or phone is. 

At the end of the day it is ALWAYS cheaper to buy the phone out right or work out a deal to lower your contract cost at the end of it, instead of getting a new phone. 4 years on and my mum is still happy with her iPhone. She has managed to drop the price to £15 a month because she doesn't want a new one. If she does, she will buy it outright. 

My little brother bought his iPhone pretty much new, he is on PAYG, and has probably saved a good £600 from not getting a contract. 

TL;DR: contracts are always more expensive, no matter what phone you go for. Whether it's a lumia for £15/pm or an iphone for £30-50 p/m. Hell you're paying £375 in total for the lumia, that's if you don't go over your limits. I'm sure you can get lumias for less that £200?

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"I signed up to a new GP's surgery a few months back. Got everything I needed ready; old GP's details, form of identification, proof of address, and printed and completed new GP form off the NHS website.

I arrive at the surgery, and notice a sign on the counter noting they only take new patient forms between 3pm and 5pm on Fridays. Lucky for me, it was 2:55pm on a Friday. 

When I reached the front of the queue and asked the receptionist if I could sign up, she informed me with a bored expression I could only do so between 3pm and 5pm on a Friday. I pointed out it was now 3:02pm, and indeed a Friday. She sighed, and passed me an application form to fill out. I proudly presented her with my various forms of identification and pre-completed form. She gave it a glance, then said nope, that's not one of *our* forms, and passed me another. I protested that it was the official NHS GP registration form, freshly downloaded that morning from the NHS GP website. She had none of it; I had to fill out *their* form, and that was that. 

A bit miffed, I moved over and started to fill out the new form. But wait! The fields were the same. The layout was the same. The form number was the same. It was the very same form I had with me, it just looked a bit different in colour and format, probably due to the printer.

I went to the back of the queue. Ten minutes later, at the front, I explained the misunderstanding. I had the right form after all! Everything was fine.

The receptionist was having none of it. Without even looking at the two bits of paper I held out before her, she said slowly, as if to an idiot, it wasn't *their* form. I had to fill out *their* form to register for the GP.

Conscious of the grumbling queue behind me, I gritted my teeth and once more, stepped aside and filled in the blasted bit of paper. Another ten minute queue and I was back in front of the delightful lady. I gave her the newly completed form, British etiquette only permitting a slight frown on my part to indicate my frustration.

Where's the white form, she asks? White form? What white form? I wasn't given a white form. Oh, she yawns, you need to complete a white form *too*, you must have lost it.

I take a white form. I step aside from the queue, and fill in some random questions about my ethnicity and language skills. Another ten minutes queuing. I return to the front of the queue, very nearly displaying a scowl, but it’s done. She has what she wants on paper; she has what she wants from me. She's established who's in charge in this new relationship, and I'm allowed to leave and get on with my life.

It was the financial education of the policyholders that was a disaster as it led them to believe that they were guaranteed 20% returns. They assured themselves for less than the principal, expecting the end value to be higher as a result of these returns.

Then, when their magical returns didn't appear, there was another disaster as the government stepped in to rescue a load of gamblers.

Anyway, back to the point, it's actually looking quite viable at the moment to get an interest only mortgage and invest your capital repayments. 8% returns have been achievable, and should be for some time, beating the 4.4% interest in the example given by Frankeh. You don't need it to be a particularly safe vehicle at the start either. If you're talking about a 25 year mortgage, it would make most sense to invest in something relatively risky at first and as you approach the end of the mortgage, wind things down to more stable assets. It's not for the faint of heart but for the knowledgable it's a sensible option.

I'd say that we should ALSO restrict immigration, but that seems to automatically make people a racist and a UKIP supporter in this subreddit and you just get downvoted. 

But anyway, these garden cities will bring in 45k new homes a year when we need about 250k, so by far it isn't enough. So as well as getting the 45k number higher why don't we ALSO try and lower the 250k number. Lowering immigration won't solve it but it'll help, maybe it could bring the new houses we need down to like 200k or even lower. 

I mean if bulldozing Coventry and building it up like shanghai seems to be an idea good enough to be upvoted then surely lowering immigration shouldn't be toooo farfetched. 

Immigration is also a thing that could be slowed much quicker, could happen in a couple years instead of these garden cities not providing any houses until after 2020 which is ages away. 

Can the UK even set immigration laws? Or is that something that is done by the EU as a whole? 

But yeah anyway, kind of a tl;dr, as everybody else said this isn't enough, multiple things need to happen, lowering immigration could be one of them, as well as building shanghai v2 in Coventry. As well as building more houses to meet demand why don't we also try to lower the demand?

They know that sort of stuff can be effective in loyal circles). Anything Robinson or the leadership does that annoys the membership can easily lead to a split or some sort of mass desertion. And in Northern Irish politics, even doing something that themuns like can spark outrage - witness the brouhaha over a Protestant woman speaking the Irish language or a couple of GAA shirts.

Closer to the centre, you have parties that likely have more appeal than the DUP. You have the resolutely nonsectarian Alliance (and the Greens, for those who swing that way), NI21 (They're more or less the same as UK Conservatives, but in terms of Irish Unionism, even that markes them out as a refreshing breath of fresh air!), and even the UUP's historical sectarian baggage might be less unpalatable than the DUP's more dogmatic and theocratic flavour. If significant numbers of nationalists are willing to throw their votes across the fence, the DUP isn't likely to be the main beneficiaries.

Robinson really does have no room for maneouvre, least of all towards attracting nationalist votes; there simply *won't* be any action just because of where the DUP finds itself. It has nowhere to go but down from here.

However, this documentary was awful, truly awful. It's a perfect sign of why BBC Three is such a shit channel, and why the outcry to keep BBC Three on TV instead of online has been so low. Jamil's attacks on those that questioned the logic of the documentary was also very bad. I don't doubt that she believes all these things, and it also wouldn't surprise me to hear that she hadn't viewed porn as a youngster.

What I think is that she's taken her previous and current roles in music and TV, and has concluded that she is a voice for the youth of today, which is kinda what the BBC has marketed the likes of her and Nick Grimshaw as. The reality is that being marketed as a voice for the youth of today isn't enough to make a documentary, especially one that makes such sweeping statements. It's also realistic to assume that the likes of Grimshaw and Jamil simply aren't in touch with the youth of today. While Jamil has actually been quite good on the chart show, Nick Grimshaw has really struggled with his morning show, and Sweat The Small Stuff just feels like a vehicle for the BBC to try and push him some more.

Making a documentary is hard, and although Jamil probably put a lot of work into it she needs to realise that a documentary without a compelling argument based on facts/science/etc just won't work.

MK is well connected to London, so it is also a dorm town, which brings money into the place and means most of the newer estates are very nice places. Some companies have even moved out of London and set up a head office heres. The Open University is based here, a fairly unique, major employer.

It is also close enough to the M1 to house logistics, warehousing and manufacturing. And with plenty of money coming in from outside, it means MK has a fairly good local economy.

I think building a few more places like this would be the way to go, but it isn't just a case of finding a bit of spare countryside somewhere, they need to find *exactly* the right place to do it.

Of course for the little Englander et al., or rather the white nationalist whose view of Britain is ethnocentric and implicitly racist, the issues of anyone non-white cannot be British since Britain is essentialised as white.

They did this in Suarez's yellow card tackle, which certainly deserved yellow, and was in retaliation for Demichelis' physicality in the first 10 minutes of the game.

Suarez turns players inside out and they reach out and grab him all the time. His footwork in a crowded box causes a huge number of hand ball, three of them last week. Two were inadvertent and uncalled (properly) but you've got to expect Suarez to beg for that call.

--

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in:

United States -- Muslim 0.6%

Australia -- Muslim 1.5%

Canada -- Muslim 1.9%

China -- Muslim 1.8%

Italy -- Muslim 1.5%

Norway -- Muslim 1.8%

At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs.

This is happening in:

Denmark -- Muslim 2%

Germany -- Muslim 3.7%

United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7%

Spain -- Muslim 4%

Thailand -- Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for

Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:

France -- Muslim 8%

Philippines -- 5%

Sweden -- Muslim 5%

Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3%

The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5%

Trinidad &amp; Tobago -- Muslim 5.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana -- Muslim 10%

India -- Muslim 13.4%

Israel -- Muslim 16%

Kenya -- Muslim 10%

Russia -- Muslim 15%

After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8%

At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:

Bosnia -- Muslim 40%

Chad -- Muslim 53.1%

Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and ***ya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:

Albania -- Muslim 70%

Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4%

Qatar -- Muslim 77.5%

Sudan -- Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:

Bangladesh -- Muslim 83%

Egypt -- Muslim 90%

Gaza -- Muslim 98.7%

Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1%

Iran -- Muslim 98%

Iraq -- Muslim 97%

Jordan -- Muslim 92%

Morocco -- Muslim 98.7%

Pakistan -- Muslim 97%

Palestine -- Muslim 99%

Syria -- Muslim 90%

Tajikistan -- Muslim 90%

Turkey -- Muslim 99.8%

United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan -- Muslim 100%

Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100%

Somalia -- Muslim 100%

Yemen -- Muslim 100%",1,1397484696,null,0,false,0,cgs2y49,t3_22zsvq,t1_cgs2y49,t1_cgs2tpj,null,1433348961,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

Secondly, his lack of backing to lambert not only sums up himself, but also the way the club is being run. Lambert hasn't had 100% backing from the board and from Lerner, although he makes massive errors, not only in the media but also in his team selection, he doesn't deserve the full brunt of this backlash.

A real example of the point I'm trying to put across would be a headline saying ""25 schools probed over alleged fast food takeover plot"", where 25 schools catering services weren't serving healthy food. Yes, they should serve healthy food. Yes, the catering should be corrected to serve healthy food. But is there actually a plot? No, the people who were catering were of the world view that deep fried potatoes are an acceptable form of food. There is no secret society of dinner persons that is trying to overthrow salads.

So again. I DO think these schools should be improved. I don't think that Islam, Catholicism, the Church of England or any religion has a place in a school outside of a humanities class. But do you really think this is a ""Islamic takeover plot""? That the schools really are funded by some politically motivated group with the agenda of trying to undermine the countries schooling system?

I have a contract with phone - it's £21 a month, my phone (xperia Z) was £100 on top of that on a 24 month contract, so just over £600 over the two years, the cheapest I could get a similar sim-only contract would be around £15 a month I guess? (It's a basic-ish package, I've never gone over limits, extra charges are all abroad or 0845/0870 shit, it's actually the same package I've had for about 7/8? years that started at £12 a month sim only and got upgraded at some point to include a phone, no idea what the limits are other than the internet is ""unlimited"" with I think 500mb fair use (at least it was a few years ago, I haven't checked since) - so not unlimited at all but quite a low limit, I rarely exceed that though as I usually use wifi to do anything data intensive, Ive never been charged when I have gone over, I occasionally tether but generally only if my home internet is down, never stream on data.)

Anyway, at £15 a month for a sim only contract I've spent £244 on the phone, maybe I could have got a basic contract at £10 a month, which would have been £364 for the phone, which I think retailed at between £500 and £600 when I got it, presumably could have found it cheaper if I'd looked hard enough though but I doubt that low. As I got it a few weeks within it coming out I presumably wouldn't have found it second hand.  This is without taking into account that 24 months is really 21 months before you get a new phone.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"Nope, I don't think immigration or birth rate measures would cut to the heart of the engine for the housing problem.  To whit:

&gt; Average household size in Great Britain has decreased from 3.1 persons in 1961 to 2.4 persons in 2011. http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_259965.pdf


In 1961, the UK population was 52.8 million.  In 2001 it was 62.8 million.  That's a rise of 10 million, from just having more people - needing a net extra 4.2 million houses (at 2.4 people per house).

The demand in terms of number of houses for the 52.8 million people from 1961 increased by 4.9 million houses by 2011.

That is, the tendency of people to live with fewer people per house contributed _more_ to housing demand than _all_ of the increase in population (from births, and net EU and non-EU immigration).  

Note that this _underestimates_ the difference, as migrants are more likely to live in larger 'households' (either a genuinely larger family, often extended, or many people over for work sharing a house) - thus migrants tend to increase the 'people per household' number.

It always surprises me when house pressure is discussed that this is not brought to the fore more often.

One of the fundamental reasons for there being housing demand is that _people don't want to live like their grandparents did_.  Rather than sharing a house with their parents, they'd rather have their own.

One other aspect worth considering, that I don't have figures for, is intra-country migration.  That is - people leaving the old industrial areas, and moving to the south east.  This puts a housing demand in the south east, and _would not be affected_ by immigration or birth rates.  I can't dig out general figures for this, but I note that between 1961 and 2011, the population of Greater Manchester dropped by 20%, and that of Greater London rose by 10%.  More detail would be needed, but it surely must have contributed to any housing shortage.


There's plenty of houses, and space for some more.  The problem is, it's all in the North [0].  I say, move Parliament and the Civil service, lock stock and barrel to Manchester, and that'll cause forces to distribute the population over a much wider area. (I know the logistics of that, and hence it's likelihood).

More people are going there because other like-minded people are either already there, or are going to move there.

He said that holding back a city doesn't work, only weakens the city being held back and does not aid other cities.

He ended not on a solution, but on a bit of a compromise. This basically said have a bit of give and take with Government grants and transport spending, and less moaning from both sides, and recognition that other areas need support as well as London needing to be praised for growing well (I think this is the entire principle behind HS2 - yet no-one in either areas of concern seem to think it will benefit them, North or London).

Getting a seat during rush hour is pretty much impossible from everything I hear.  The other thing to be aware of is that the train journey itself is the easiest part of the commute- it's the transit before and after that really, really suck up the time.  Look for jobs near kings cross, as having to travel across london can easily add another hour into your commute.  And living within an easy walk to the station makes the commute a lot easier as well.  A LOT easier.  If you do go for a career in London and want to commute long term, Shelford is not the place to live.  A five minute walk to the cambridge station is.

One other thing to consider is sharing the commute, if your partner is working in Cambridge, and moving somewhere halfway between London and Cambridge where the fast train stops- (Royston and Letchworth, I believe).

The Kings Cross fast train is definitely the way to go, and if you're currently in Shelford and end up getting a job near Kings Cross, consider moving closer to the station, it really cuts down on the commute.

At age 18 or above there are no limits with exception of buying drinks for under 18's plus local laws regarding drinking on the streets however these areas are very well signposted.


It is legal to drink in the home in the UK from the age of 5. Children under 16 can go anywhere in a pub as long as they're accompanied by an adult but cannot have an alcoholic drink.

At the age of 16-17 you can have beer, wine or cider with a meal as long as it is bought by an adult.

It is illegal for people under 18 to buy alcohol in a pub, off-licence, shop or elsewhere.

And in most cases, it is against the law for anyone to buy alcohol for someone under 18 to drink in a pub or a public place, an exception for example is having a drink with a meal in a pub.

It is legal for adults to buy alcohol for children over four to drink in the home.

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"Yeah, pretty fucked up. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumiputera_(Malaysia)

&gt; Certain but not all pro-bumiputra policies exist as affirmative action for bumiputras, for NEP is racial-based and not deprivation-based. For instance, all Bumiputra, regardless of their financial standing, are entitled 7 percent discount on houses or property, including luxurious units; whilst a low-income non-Bumiputra receives no such financial assistance. Other preferential policies include quotas for the following: admission to government educational institutions, qualification for public scholarships, positions in government, and ownership of businesses. Most of the policies were established in the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) period. Many policies focus on trying to achieve a bumiputra share of corporate equity, comprising at least 30% of the total. Ismail Abdul Rahman proposed this target after the government was unable to agree on a suitable policy goal.

Good innit?

&gt; In a report titled 2012 Investment Climate Statement - Malaysia published by the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (U.S. Department of State), under the heading ""Ethnic Preferences"", part of a paragraph succinctly describes the reality of such Bumiputra policy as follows:""Many of the preference policies are opaque, with details of implementation largely left to the various ministries and civil servants within those ministries. Policies and practices vary greatly. Some practices are explicit and contained in law or regulation, while others are informal, leaving much ambiguity for potential investors. The civil service itself is subject to Bumiputra hiring preferences. The NEM [New Economic Model] proposes reforming ethnic preferences in business ownership and social safety net programs. Some conservative Bumiputra groups have voiced strong opposition to any significant changes to the extensive preferences.""

As long as you're born to the right ethnic group of course...

&gt;Companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (Bursa Saham Kuala Lumpur) must have 30% bumiputra ownership of equity to satisfy listing requirements. Foreign companies that operate in Malaysia also must adhere to this requirement.
For a limited period, a certain percentage of new housing in any development has to be sold to bumiputra owners. Housing developers are required to provide a minimum 7% discount to bumiputra buyers of these lots. This is required regardless of the income level of the potential buyer. Remaining unsold houses after a given time period are allowed to be sold to non-bumi if the developer proves attempts have been made to fulfill the requirement. There is no bumiputra discount on existing housing.
A basket of government-run (and profit-guaranteed) mutual funds are available for purchase by bumiputra buyers only. The Amanah Saham Nasional (ASN) has return rates approximately 3 to 5 times that of local commercial banks.
Many government-tendered projects require that companies submitting tenders be bumiputra owned. This requirement has led to non-bumiputras teaming up with bumiputra companies to obtain projects, in a practice known as ""Ali Baba"". Ali, the bumiputra, is included solely to satisfy this requirement, and Baba (the non-bumiputra) pays Ali a certain sum in exchange.
Projects were earmarked for bumiputra contractors to enable them to gain expertise in various fields.
Approved Permits (APs) for automobiles preferentially allow bumiputra to import vehicles. Automotive companies wishing to bring in cars need to have an AP to do so. APs were originally created to allow bumiputra participation in the automotive industry, since they were issued to companies with at least 70% bumiputra ownership. In 2004, The Edge (a business newspaper) estimated that APs were worth approximately RM 35,000 each. They also estimated that the late Nasimuddin Amin, the former chairman of the Naza group, received 6,387 in 2003, making him the largest single recipient of APs. More than 12,200 APs were issued in 2003. In addition to APs, foreign car marquees are required to pay between 140% to 300% import duty.

Basically you can get completely fucking minted if you're an indigenous Malay and screw you to everyone else. This was originally started way back when because of the large merchant class which was dominated by the ethnic Chinese in the country and also pretty much led to the splitting off of Singapore from Malaysia, guess which country is an economic powerhouse now and which country is, comparatively I'll concede, a sleepy economic backwater.",0,1397491469,null,0,false,0,cgs5ybl,t3_22y4jw,t1_cgs5ybl,t1_cgs531o,null,1433350379,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,neenoonee,null,null,"Firstly, nobody gives a crap after you've finished Uni what you got in your English GCSE. Nobody gives a crap after your A-Levels to be honest. I could tell other people what I got in my GCSE's and they'd go ""Erm, you have a degree though yeah?"" cos it really doesn't matter after college. I don't even think my GCSE's are on there.

Don't let the schools lead you up the garden path. GCSE's are important, but only in the sense that you'll really struggle to get anywhere if you don't. If you don't get great ones, I wouldn't worry, it'll just make things a bit more difficult further along the line. Think of them like a set of keys. If you lose them or don't get them, it doesn't mean you can't break into the lock - just means you have to find alternative methods.

Also, don't let them lead you into believing that exam results trump everything else. We're told since we're 5 that if we want to get anywhere in life, we need to pass exams. Then when you come to get a job and you proudly slap your degree on the interview desk, the guy who you want to give you a job will go ""Erm yeah, that's good and all...but do you have any experience?"". When you get into College, do not EVER underestimate the value of work experience - and you're best getting the experience when you're in college and can afford too. 

You'll do fine on your GCSE's - you seem like a fairly eloquent and well written person, maybe ask teachers if there's any after school revision sessions they can recommend or have put on? That way, if you attend them, you'll HAVE to study - there wont be any way out of it. I'm 23, a recent graduate with a full time job and I can quite honestly say that nobody has asked for my GCSE results since I applied for college.

It was really the timing of those two away matches which meant we flew under the radar for so long. Even though those two losses are quite acceptable, even when we're challenging for the title.

Because, if you and your rival both win at home against each other, then the title is decided on your performance against all the other teams. So, in the context of a title fight, those two draws actually hurt more than the two losses. (Assuming you can beat your rivals at home)

With City we have done this, and with Chelsea we have a chance of doing this. So if you ignore those two losses for a moment, it becomes 53 out of 57 possible points (or 50/54 against non-rival teams). A huge effort, and what has led to us being title favourites.

1. When you decide to leave education and get a job, so you rely on your most recent qualifications.
2. When you are applying to the next stage in your education.

Believe me when I say that outside of a few *exceptional* circumstances (like applying for Oxford or Cambridge), universities don't care about your GCSEs - only about your A-levels, or whatever other further education qualification you get (like a BTEC). You don't even have to list them on your CV once you get one or two levels of education away from them; employers don't care about them unless they're relevant or recent.

Teachers' job is to motivate you, and preaching doom and gloom if you don't study *all the time* is part of it, unfortunately. They do have your best interests at heart, though - your success reflects well on them as a teacher, after all. Are your teachers available at all over the Easter break? If they are, try discussing some of your concerns with them and they'll surely point you in the right direction - it's their job!

If you find it hard to get the motivation to revise, try shaking things up a little.

I think more regular trains will off set most of the time saved with faster trains. I think it's most down to price, nobody wants to pay £15-20 a day to get to work. 

Actually forget all that, HS2 isn't due to finish until after 2030, so HS3 if it ever happens would probably be closer to 2040. So rather than spend another £70 Billion or whatever on another rail line(which Japan probably builds for much less and they have friggin Maglev trains), i think we should just concentrate on self driving cars which would not only be specific to 1 route, but to the entire country. Sounds crazy by thats 26 years away, i'm pretty sure all new cars by then would be fully automatic. I mean if they're testing fully automatic cars now then 25 years doesn't seem bad for them to be a fully reality. It would make most long distance rail absolute if a self driving car can just be like a train from your front door to the destination, not to mention cheaper.

But yeah anyway moving away from that point, i agree about the airport thing. Boris island did sound silly at first but everything i hear about it seems rather positive and feasible. Apparently there would be enough room for 250,000 - 300,000+ new houses in the area in and around heathrow if it wasn't there. I think the estimate cost is somehow less than the total cost of HS2 too which is kinda crazy.

Another lie is more money. Sure you earn more but the cost of housing is so disproportionately high that you ultimately end up with less disposable income.

Also with HS2 replacing all the non stop express runs on the WCML that leaves more paths for other services.

Boris island is way more than HS2 about three times more once you account for the infrastructure needed to get to it, still might be a good idea.

GCSE results themselves are bollocks once you get your A-levels. I don't think I've ever put them on my CV. No employer in my experience cares. That said, they are crucial for getting into sixth-form. Sixth form is important if you want to get into university. 

However, and this is something I wish I'd known when I was your age, if you can teach yourself effective study habits at your age then that's going to put yourself in a great position for your A-levels and especially university. Personally I breezed through GCSE's and A-levels and had to learn the study habits during revision for my finals - it might have been a bit easier if I'd been learning them as I went along!

A revision trick that I learned during my last-minute scramble was to take a load of past papers (and ideally a marking guide) and sit somewhere quiet (a library is ideal, or your dining room table - somewhere far away from reddit) and work through the questions, then check the answers when you've finished- you not only learn to answer the questions that actually come up, but get instant feedback of if you're getting them right or not.

If you completely fuck them up it's really not the end of the world - you can always retake them (I think? Like I said, it was a really long time ago I took them). That said, they're not rocket science, so if you put a few weeks hard work in now you can probably boost your grade a good few points.

So I flip between such approaches because it lets me remain certain in my conviction that really it's all just feel good better than thou horse-shit, stemming from a ""we feel we should defend the poor and stupid"" from verbal assault.

If two months' decent work means you go to the nice Sixth Form that you want rather than the dodgy one that will kill any motivation you have remaining and in the process severely limit your future choices then I say you should put your head down and study. 

In time, no-one will ask you what results you got on your GCSEs, and they will be the least important qualifications you have. But in a few months' time they're going to be the most important, as they enable you to get to your next desired level of education.

Once you get to Sixth Form, I recommend balancing school with work experience. If you decide you want to concentrate on getting into a good Uni then you have the chance to stop work and concentrate on school. If you decide you have a job you want to do more of, and you don't need more qualifications to join the industry you want, then you can finish your education at your A-Levels; I wouldn't recommend dropping out of a course as it's all valuable life experience and could help you if you change your mind later, but you don't have to sign up for more.

true,rockstarsheep,eng-Oxfordshire,London,"Sometimes you need to do the opposite as to what everyone else is doing. I'll elaborate a little on what big brands are doing and show you, I hope, how their weaknesses, could be your strengths. The reason for this, is that big or small, the principles are exactly the same. It is just the scale that differs - and yes, the budgets that are assigned to achieve the goals set. So, in 2014, big brands are starting to realise that maybe 50% or more of their digital ad adspend, be that on keywords or display advertising {banners} are not being seen, as reported that they are, by their potential target audiences, then a lot of money is being wasted on what amounts to fraud. The assumption that more platforms to advertise on, and mobile is being trumpeted as the place to be, doesn't really hold water. So what are they doing about this? Well, they're not ditching their channels, but they are paying closer attention to creating 'experiences' - that is to say - real world events - where they can meet their customers in the flesh and tell their stories. It's simple - as people, we need to trust each other to develop relationships. In person is far more effective than at a distance. You don't however want to ram your story down the throats of your audience - they'll balk. It's like going on a first date. Show enough to get interest going. Then let your audience start talking. So, what's your experience for your audience? Well, they're going to have some problems to solve. You may know what they are, however give them the opportunity to tell you. And then you can put together a proposal to help them solve their problems. Who to talk to then? Well, who solves most of the office problems? The office manager, more than likely. Or whomever else needs your services. {I know this is all very general, but the principles are the same. And as an FYI, where my knowledge and experience comes from - I have worked on / for FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 corporations for quite some time now. And I've seen a lot of time and money wasted on trying to stack the marketing high and sell 'em cheap.

User takes public PGP key of dealer, encrypts his/her address using the public key.

The encrypted message is then sent through to the dealer who runs the message through a decrypter (With the private key at the same time) - The message is then decrypted.

As the encrypted messages are sent through SR via a web form, and they have the dealer's private key, I don't see why anyone who has access wouldn't be able to read addresses after decryption.

Also, the irony in all of this - you state it's because of bad feelings of Imperialism (You say colonisation, but then describe Imperialism, so I assume you mean imperialism.)

Yet, Aregentina, the same country claiming to have such a big moral issue with this, were the ones who invaded the Falklands. They're the ones who sought to aggresively expand their borders and they're the ones who broke international law to try do so.

Or at least aspects of the job that will require skills that are life skills or just generally adaptable. Like customer service is often an area to focus on as most jobs these days involve talking to external customers or internal customers. 

For example, say your current job is.. IT Support. But you're looking for a new job in lets say... the Fire Department. 

Now obviously your core skill set for IT, has no application to fighting fires, Flushing a DNS Cache isn't going to help here. 

But, you are used to working in a high risk and fast paced environment and working as a part of a close knit team meeting specific deadlines. You're also aware of time impact, business impact and dealing with people in emotional states.

Performing 100% while still annoyed at coaches that dropped you due to their huge ego's. Vlarr aswell, he was one of the only players to clap the fans at the palace game, along with delph, albrighton and 1 or 2 others.
Then we could move onto players like nZog, lets be honest, he isnt the best player in the world, but he is a threat. Everyone said there was an argument between him and lambert, but there was no truth to this, until recently when he uploaded images to instagram arguing with fans saying they dont know what happens at avfc. 
No matter what we personally think, players cant perform 100% when these sort of things are in the back of their minds. They should be wanting to play for managers and wanting to perform 100%, they need to be happy and not fearful that they will get dropped over personal opinions. If you under perform than you deserve to be dropped, but not because you disagree with someones opinions.

I decided to find work because I'd done LOADS of work experience, found a crap (but well paid) job then got offered a job in India.

Came home and couldn't find a job, so decided to go to Uni and study International Development with Geography. I applied thinking I'd never get in and they offered me an Unconditional Offer - which basically means I'd been given the place right away, without having to pass any further exams or do any other courses.

That then led to me spending a further 3 months abroad in Nicaragua (with ICS and nothing to do with Uni) then I graduated in November! I've since started my own Pest Control business which is quite successful.

I did get fucking awesome GCSE's though. But like I said, other than when I applied for college, nobody bloody cared. And Uni obviously didn't give a crap about either if they offered me an unconditional place.

true,Sioreth,lfc68,,"I can understand, because we have been so dominant against them, we might expect another easy win. A loss would certainly be a surprise, and a kick in the guts.

If City win their matches, and we win against Norwich, then Mourinho will most likely come to Anfield feeling that only a win is good enough. I think this will play into our hands more than if he can set up Chelsea to play for a draw and to possibly nick a win. He may do this anyway, and hope we and City slip up in the last few matches, but it would a huge gamble.

So, I think Palace is the match we are most likely to slip up on. We've already seen what Palace can achieve at home, and while we are more potent in attack than Chelsea, we are also more defensively fragile. This means if we have an off day in attack, there's always the danger of shipping a goal or two and losing.

Also, there's a good chance now that we could be playing against Palace to seal the title. That sort of pressure can do funny things to a team.

I think I might have added to your worries... Sorry!

true,michael2l,null,null,"Here's what I'd like to see against Norwich, and possibly Chelsea depending on how it works there, two teams who I both think aren't going to allow us to play the counter-attacking style we've dominated teams with.

4-2-3-1 with Suarez playing as the lone striker, Coutinho, Sterling, and Gerrard as attacking mids, and Lucas and Allen in the holding roles with the same back four.

I think with Sturridge out moving Gerrard forward will give us an extra goal-scoring and creative threat in the final third.  Gerrard doesn't have the legs to press, but I think the pressing/countering will be less important here where Norwich will be ready to defend for their lives, and what will be more important is having players willing to shoot and/or try a risky pass on the edge of the 18 yard box to unlock the defense.

Having two CDM's will give Flannagan/Johnson the license to bomb forward on the flanks, which will likely be open if Norwich tries to build a 10 man wall in their box, and I could see Gerrard arriving late in the box to head or volley one of those crosses from the wing.

I know a lot of people won't like messing with success.  But I still believe Gerrard has the ability to change a game on the offensive side of the ball with a single strike of his boot.  Even if he takes a shot that doesn't go in, it is likely to be fast and low, and difficult for a keeper to deal with.  Getting that opening goal will be what matters most against Norwich and I'd like us to throw everything at it we can from the beginning.

So basically, once again, you don't judge any game for yourself.

Just use Mourinho's name as your argument, and all is well, right?
 
&gt;His substitutions are excellent, nobody changes a game like Mourinho. He has won us many points from losing/drawing positions with substitutes.

Most of the substitutions this Season have been down to poor starting lineups. Bringing on Mikel or Luiz isn't a genius move, every single team does it, Fulham a prime example, Magath the tactical genius now?. Bringing on Ba when we're playing Torres, another genius move? Or what about bringing on someone when you've used Oscar for the last how many games and he's running around clueless due to fatigue?

&gt;Hazard is our best player, of course Mourinho is going to rely on him, especially considering it's a young squad, still developing. The PSG game shows how other players are starting to take responsibility, and that will be even more true next season. Getting a proper striker will help too - Hazard has had to step up to compensate. 

And that's wrong, every single player we have is World Class. Does Man City rely on Yaya Toure? Do Arsenal rely on Santi Carzola? Does Borrisia Dortmund rely on Lewandowski? Nope, there are 11 players on the pitch, get a decent passing system in place like Borrisia, Man City, Bayern and Real and you use them all to your advantage. I could say Arsenal, but for some reason they've totally stopped using the System they used earlier on in the Season and it's cost them.

You state the PSG game, we played absolutely shocking against a weak PSG. There's one man you can thank for us winning the game, and he's called Cavani.

&gt;Mourinho was right about Mata. We made a nice sum off him, and have gone from strength to strength since he left. He has looked lost at United, and has not been able to save their season. 

Mourinho was wrong, we've lost many points due to obvious tactics i.e. relying on Hazard to score goals on the counter, I would list the games we've lost this Season, but you already know them, so I won't bother.

And Mata for Man United in their last few games has played pretty damn fantastic, head over to /r/Soccer, plenty of real Chelsea fans over there who miss him and still see the transfer as laughable. Or, you can stay within your group of friends and all agree with each other.

You always attack me, yet many from this sub and your sub are over there under fake club badges then you complain that you're downvoted for your opinion over there when in fact your downvoted because you opinion is poor. The only time I'm downvoted over there is when I'm downed by my own fans, says a lot, doesn't it?

&gt;People think you're a troll because you stick by your ludicrous opinions which are so patently wrong. I (and many others) find it difficult to believe that anyone could seriously think those things.

Nope, mostly your sub and the Americans.

Which is ironic, because you have the same opinion as someone who watches 5 minutes of Football a week and it's not even their main Sport.

It's not the downvotes that annoy me, it isn't the attacks or the PMs either, it's the lack of logic and the lack of discussion whenever you or someone close to you replies to me. Your arguments are weak and like I said earlier, you use Mourinho's name to defend your side of the discussion, why can't you use your own head?

I suppose that Scottish people may change their minds over time if they begin to equate the weapons with economic certainty.

&gt;Until now equal job evaluation has mainly affected local councils, where jobs are assessed and given pay grades. Birmingham alone has so far paid around half of its £1.1bn bill for the back pay settlements to the women – including cleaners, cooks, care workers and school lunch supervisors – who were denied bonuses and attendance allowances given to male road cleaners and refuse collectors.

So you are saying that everyone, irrespective of the job you do, should be paid the same?

so a person, say Lunch Time Supervisor, has the same skill sets and requirements as, say, Road Cleaners and they should be paid the same wage?

This is totally insane!!!

Store Stackers != Distribution stackers.

Indeed when I worked in a Supermarket, the warehouse guys earned more than the Checkout workers, mainly because they had to work in the snow and rain, unload trucks, keep the loading bays clear, work the forklift and other manual work, checkout workers just 'Beep..Beep..Beep.. that's £11.20 please...'

&gt;""In the supermarkets check-out staff and shelf-stackers are mostly women. The people in the warehouses are pretty much all men. And, who would be surprised, the group that is mostly men gets paid more,"" he said. ""We are very confident that the jobs are pretty much the same. In the warehouses they take stuff off the shelves, put it on a pallet and stick it on a lorry. In the supermarket, they do the reverse: take the pallets off the lorry, unstack them and put stuff on the shelves.""

But the store side DO NOT unload the Lorries, that is the Warehouse job, indeed the most they do is pick a box off the cage and put it on the shelf, Warehouse will drag them out for replenishment.

Christ we offered women the chance to work in the warehouse, not many took it as it was a lot of labour and manual work.

Personally I breezed through GCSE's and A-levels and had to learn the study habits during revision for my finals - it might have been a bit easier if I'd been learning them as I went along!

SO MUCH this.

To a point, I have the sort of memory where I can easily just remember things.

Result being, that I breezed through GCSEs and then A Levels while doing zero revision (much to my friends' disgust).  On the back of the results I got, I then got into the University of Oxford.

Which I then went on to drop out of - with virtually no ""study"" skills I really fucked myself over when I came to the point of actually needing them.

I've done OK since, though would very likely have done better with a BA(Oxon) under my belt. That's what I get for being a lazy arse at school!

Learn to study now, it really is worth it in the long run.

edit: as to the GCSEs themselves, I think they - and many other qualifications - are most important while they are your highest qualification.

As much as I agree with Mr McCrea, unfortunately this will not change anything whatsoever. Sinn Fein and the DUP will continue to be in their faux conflict and opposition of each other, when in reality - at the Assembly level - they don't really give a fuck about people.

Don't forget to write the obvious, because they can be some very easy marks.

Also, continuous reminding. Try summarising your notes. Handy last minute revision read through and doing so forces you to think about it (rather than just reading through without really taking it in). 

When I was revision for GCSEs, the teachers told us you remember 10% of what you read, but 90% of what you teach. So, teach your parents older/younger siblings, pet cat, random item of furniture...

true,physicsisdead,null,null,"As a fellow 16 year old who's heading towards good grades and has a fair bit of experience with exams, here's my advice in no particular order:

* Make a revision timetable and try to stick to it;

* Make sure your workspace is tidy - that is, your desk/table must only have the essentials for revising and then any material you need to revise. Ideally you should be working away from your computer, but I use my computer desk when I revise;

* Maybe buy revision books if you can afford them. I've found them really useful for subjects like English as they contain everything you need to know about the subjext, as well as revision tips, exam tips, etc;

* When you revise, go through everything you have on a subject and write notes. Then look through your notes and highlight the most important things that you absolutely need to know. After that, rewrite the notes over and over again until you can't get them out of your head;

* Get rid of any distractions. STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM REDDIT. Trust me, it doesn't do you any favours. Also, put your mobile phone in another room while you're revising - use a watch to check the time if you need to, but you do NOT need a phone when you're revising;

* Revise in short bursts rather than over extended periods of time. Maybe do twenty minutes and a five minute break, three times. That makes an hour of revising and it didn't even feel like that long! After that you can take a break of half an hour or whatever to do what you want like go on reddit, but then return to revising;

* Keep track of how much revising you're doing, like making a tally of how many hours you've done for each subject.

* Print off past papers and time yourself while doing them - don't let yourself take more time than you're supposed to! Then look through the marking schemes and mark your work, correcting yourself where necessary. It teaches you a surprising amount about exam technique and what examiners are looking for (I find past papers are the best for maths and science subjects).

You don't have to do any of these, but this is what I find has helped me during exams so I hope at least some of this is of use to you. Obviously I have no idea how much GCSEs will matter in the future, but you'll need good results in order to get into sixth form and then good A level results to get into university; now is the best time to get into the swing of revising!",0,1397503149,null,0,1397503367,0,cgsbtji,t3_230h1w,t1_cgsbtji,t3_230h1w,null,1433353157,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Allen got in possession in (or just outside) the box 4 times yesterday. Probably as often as anyone in that period other than Suarez. He passed every time. Twice it was definitely the right choice, but once he should have shot (and the other is probably a matter of opinion). That is why I don't expect goals from him these next four games.

Edit: just checked and Henderson has 11 league goals in 100 games, Allen 0 in 30. Obviously though Allen has more appearances as a sub and you'd expect his goal rate to go up. Nice just to see the stats though.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"That's an awful lot of effort for such delusions. I'm almost impressed. But then again, I'm not, because it's not surprising. You genuinely think these things, and you genuinely think you're above everyone because of it.

That's what sets you apart, you know. It's not just that you hold these inane views, but that you are convinced they distinguish you. That you are somehow enlightened, and see a greater truth than everyone else. That anyone and everyone who disagrees with you don't do so based off their own thoughts, but because they're sheep. It's not once crossed your mind that the reason why a lot of people disagree with you is because you're consistently and unfailingly *wrong*. It's not that you see something that we all don't, it's that you can't see what is right in front of your nose - no wonder, considering how far you have your head shoved up your arse. And you're so utterly unable to even entertain the prospect of being wide of the mark that you will press on, in your one man crusade against the world. You'll read this and you'll probably note it as 'evidence' - ""*See*! That's exactly what I'm talking about!""

The biggest delusion is that you have told yourself it's just a small group of people who agree with me, but once again, you're completely and utterly false. The ""real Chelsea fans"" agree with you? That Mourinho is a moron who has only cost us points, that he was wrong about Mata, that anyone could do what he does. Laughable. Do you even read the shit you write? 

Has it not twigged yet? You are loathed by the people on this subreddit. It's not ""my sub and Americans"" - it is *everyone* with half a brain. I'll put aside how vaguely xenophobic that comment is, but it does not surprise me in the slightest. The self-importance of it does not surprise me either.

Your assessment of the PSG game says it all. PSG didn't play well, no. Cavani missed his 2 chances, and Blanc got his tactics wrong. But we did exactly what we needed to do. Lost our main man, and still did it. Schurrle came on and was excellent. Mourinho's plans worked just as he'd worked them in training - and that's according to John Terry. And we hit the bar twice - should have been an awful lot more comfortable than it was. The best thing though, was the attitude. Kept on pressing, never gave up hope of getting that second goal. How on earth can you call that performance ""absolutely shocking""? By what stretch of the imagination? I think you just have no idea of the words you are writing. 

Any fan who watches their team play like that would be proud. Not you though. You saw it through your lens of hatred and bitterness, could appreciate none of the beauty - your first thought was not pride, or joy, but how you could twist it to push your own ludicrous agenda. You find no happiness in your club, you're too busy digging for any scrap of a justification, however tenuous and downright non-existent they are. How can you even call yourself a fan?

I do not think I have ever encountered someone quite so arrogant, pretentious, narrow-minded and willfully ignorant. Trolls are trolls, but dealing with you almost makes me sad. If you are like this away from the internet and anonymity then I truly feel bad for the people around you. I'm sorry, but you just seem like a horrible person.

I think this sums you up: you are completely convinced that you are more knowledgeable about football than a manager who has won 2 European Cups, and league titles and cups in 4 different countries. He's a moron, anyone could do it, and you'd do it a hell of a lot better. Go and take a look at yourself in the mirror or something.

The Chelsea ""hatred"" stems from how Chelsea became a powerhouse and brought ""plastic fans"". It is the best excuse to hate Chelsea. For Barcelona and Real Madrid, it is for the most part a 2 club league with the finances. For Bayern, they buy everyone making German football uninteresting. The list could go on.

What makes it easier for other fans is the fact that Chelsea fans seem eager to whine about the supposed slights. I don't even go to r/soccer anymore for the simple fact that every time I go, I see someone cry foul when someone criticizes Chelsea. Then after that, they are so eager to join the Lukaku, youth talent, and Mourinho circle jerk. Cringeworthy. 

I take the stance that success breeds jealousy and hatred. Chelsea is never going to be darlings of the football world. For the very simple fact of what I said earlier. Either you can embrace it, or continue to feel sorry for yourself as it seems to be the norm these days.

Multiculturalism is too tied up in a shallow, almost trivial, acceptance of difference, without challenging at all deeper questions of hierarchies of otherness.  People claim they are progressive because they're feminist, anti-homophobic, anti-racists, whilst at the very same time they gleefully shit on people of the same gender, sexuality and colour as themselves because they are wealthier and better connected.

So, on the one hand, I agree that the left lost a massive chunk of the working classes the instant it started raising identity politics above more basic concerns with economic survival and betterment, on the other, no one with left-wing ideals should be playing the nationalist game.  

As an internationalist, it's clear the global capitalist system drives the vast majority of migration in the modern world, not some Islamic zeal to conquer the Western world.  Indeed, the principle tool that Islamic fundamentalists use to convert people is the existence and increasing severity of gross inequality under capitalism.  The ""scum"" who turn up at our gates, are economic migrants, migrants from neo-colonies, migrants from war zones, etc.  Most people would far rather live in places where they have community, language, culture, social and economic resources, etc. working in their favour.  People come because of the huge disparities in wealth between countries, largely a result of the global economic system, disparities brought about by centuries of ruthless colonial and neo-colonial exploitation.  They come because of capitalist geo-politics and resource wars (which are increasing due to environmental stress).

Hopefully, we can experiment against Norwich over the weekend to see if a midfield of Lucas/Allen/Gerrard will work.

With respect to Sturridge if he's unable to be fit for the next 2 games, we might see the emergence of Moses over on the left wing if we use a 4-3-3, with Suarez as the lone striker and Sterling to the right. Or we might actually see an appearance from Aspas with a 4-4-2 Diamond, partnered with Suarez and Sterling sitting behind them. Might see Luis Alberto on the bench as well.

Freelance Embedded Software, specifically aerospace and some automotive, mainly safety related stuff. 

I travel a lot but you dont have to if you are prepared to drop the rate a little and want to remain in a given commuter range. I do this largely FOR the travel though so lots of time in Germany clocked up and other options on the horizon. I charge ~65 to 70 Euros per hour but in the UK the tax is a little more forgiving so 45 to 50 gbp per hour. I normally calculate things on a 160 hour month average which accounts for days off and holidays and sick and whenever else I am not being paid. 

Is it as I wished it would be? it varies, i spend time getting into a company so I need to learn their way of doing things, quality systems and processes. Some places are great, some are terrible (but you can walk). The main thing I would say is that its not easy to set up in a new place, no friends, new colleagues, hotels but I normally get to hang around for 18 months or more so you settle in and start to build a life. You walk away from it again, which can be tough, but I can travel to a number of cities and towns now and find people I know. 

The downside is that I go ""home"" and I only really see family, I have no friends to call on because I have not been there for years for any length of time and oh and relationships are a nightmare but as I said, I chose the travel because I was sick of home, I could work in my area back in the UK, there is a market which I guess would mean I could build a home life again...

The idea of ""psychopaths in suits"" was described several decades ago. It's obviously strongly associated with people in power, many of whom never really commit a crime as such yet cause far more harm than the obvious violent criminals.

Though that's not the only explanation here. When a large chunk of the population is being actively dehumanized, it's no surprise that many people don't have empathy for them. People tend to dismiss the possibility that actions they perceive as directed at the dehumanized groups could possibly apply to them - until it *does* happen to them.

The ability to dehumanize groups of people isn't limited to a few sociopaths - it's a basic fact of human nature. As has been proven again and again, virtually everyone will dehumanize others in the right circumstances, and those circumstances are basically facts of everyday life.
