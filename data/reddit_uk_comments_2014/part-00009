There was a time when I thought Lucas would be the fulcrum of the team, then the ACL injury happened.

true,guyintheuk,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"The NHS could change so that it ceases to be a single, monolithic organisation and becomes more of a healthcare structure - but it will not become extinct. That is just sensationalist. 

When talking about privatisation of healthcare, most people on both sides of the argument, point to the US where it great (sort of) if you have private medical cover but dire if you do not.

Probably the better model is to look the other way at continental countries. Germany (which I know best) still provides care that is essentially free at the point of delivery but the whole system is essentially privatised with the government setting minimum standards and being the regulator rather than the provider. Doctors practices are businesses but, unlike how I understand the US works, they don't need to get approval for individual treatments. They have a standard list of things they can claim which covers all of the essentials and much preventative healthcare. Yes, it does cost more in Germany but we all know the NHS is underfunded and the care is far more personal with virtually no waits for specialist appointments or things like MRI scans. There was little or no move to 'multiple private run mini NHS's' that we are seeing in the UK. I am not sure why but maybe because their system works well without it. 

Overall, in the German system, everyone had health cover, I felt more of an individual and had a good relationship with MY doctor and I certainly experienced that, when there was an emergency, treatment was fast and effective. 

I don't like the NHS being starved of funds. I don't like many things about the way the NHS is going. But let us not pretend that privatisation is necessarily bad. A lot depends on how it is done.

true,Nark2020,null,null,"No, it isn't just you, I've seen 50/50 'for' and 'against' Duggan on my various facebook and twitter and stuff. I guess it depends where you look. 

To look at your points: 

&gt; I mean, why have sympathy for what was a gun carrying gangster? 

But you don't need to have personal sympathy for someone (i.e. think they were a lovely person, talk about them as if you'd lost a friend) to think that their being killed was morally wrong. 

Further, even if personally one doesn't see anything morally wrong with someone's killing, if the killing is against the law (and case was carried on insufficient evidence), and if you're a fan of people following the law (and you must be, OP, if you don't like 'gangsters') then there's still a problem.

You've probably read a bunch of answers like this already though, so to really engage with what you're saying here, no, I don't cease to value someone's life the minute they enter the criminal world. (Because whether that entry was by birth or choice, and if by choice, by necessity, are thorny questions.) Nor do I cease to value their life even at the minute they pick up a knife or gun. (Because are they using that to attack innocent bystanders with, or is the weapon intended for use against other criminals? Is it just a status symbol they'd rather not use? Does their criminal 'job' regularly involve violence against the general public, or is their interaction with the public non-violent, e.g. selling stolen goods or drugs to the public.) 

In other words, it's not the category they're in (criminal vs straight, armed vs unarmed) but the sum total of their specific actions to date which is going to decide whether I stop valuing their life. But even in the case of an Ian Watkins the police don't get to break the law, because that sets a precedent for acceptance of police corruption, which is bad in itself and generates even more crime.     

&gt; Would there have been the same sort of outrage had he managed to use the gun on someone else?

We don't know, because he didn't and the value of counterfactuals is limited ('You're only getting outraged because an innocent man was killed, what if he'd been guilty?' etc). 

However, even if he *had* shot someone, there are still plenty of scenarios where that alone wouldn't have made his killing legal, which is the point behind most of the outrage I've come across. Armed police who can do what they want are not much better for us than 'gangsters', as far as we the public are concerned.

The day came and went and she was still there.  I  then had to pay for bailiffs but that all took more time.  Eventually she moved out the day before I had booked the bailiffs.

true,jkg5150,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt; The only time I've seen filter lanes in a different position (between the two car lanes) is if the left lane is a ""left turn only"".

There are a few of these near me in Sheffield, and as a driver they terrify me slightly. Probably only to the right extent that they become safe, but still...

In the scenario I'm thinking of, there is a cycle lane to the left of the car lanes which go straight on. Close to the junction, a left turn only lane appears, on the far side of the cycle lane. The left turn lane is controlled by separate lights to the straight on lanes.

Occasionally, planning to turn left, I'll be slowing for the (red) lights as I move across into the turning lane -- across the cycle lane, which heads straight for the (still green) straight on lights. However diligently I check, I'm convinced that one day I'm going to go straight over an unlit cyclist :-/

It's probably a healthy level of fear, which makes me check my mirror earlier and more often, and maintain an awareness of what's in the cycle lane (usually nothing!) but I'm pretty sure it's a design flaw that the left turn lights can be red and the straight on lights green, without which it would be much less likely for a cyclist to catch up with me enough to get squished :-/",0,1389340183,null,0,false,0,cem02xm,t3_1usibd,t1_cem02xm,t1_celfuxh,null,1431880260,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then, yes, I do consider ""The Crimson Horror"", ""Curse of the Black Spot"", ""Victory of the Daleks"", and ""Vampires of Venice"" to be worse than ""Fear Her"" (which was the worst episode of RTD's tenure IMO).

Episodes from Moffat's run that I would classify as being roughly in the same ballpark as ""Fear Her"" (and thus one tier above Moffat's worst stuff) would include: ""Cold Blood"", ""The Wedding of River Song"", ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"", ""The Power of Three"", ""The Bells of Saint John"", ""Cold War"", and ""The Name of the Doctor"".

(I might also include ""Night Terrors"", ""The God Complex"", ""Hide"", and ""Nightmare in Silver"" on that list.)

&gt; 3)The S7 episodes aren't as strong in plot as the other seasons, so I guess that that's what you like about DW and thus S7 doesn't work for you.

Not as strong in plot. Banal copies of old ideas. Absolutely atrocious handling of character. Worse handling of exposition. Incredibly bad storytelling. And the few good ideas were squandered.

The closest S7 got to quality television was ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"", and even that was based around a time travel conceit that doesn't work and a central action sequence which is complete nonsense. (The fact that it might be the only episode in the season to NOT feature a deus ex machina conclusion is in its favor.)

""Being human"", in many works of literature and other media, is used often in reference to an admiration of certain human traits and a desire to possess them. In fact it's rarely ever used to mean becoming *literally*, biologically and everything, part of the human race.

The Doctor certainly fits the bill. His own actions serve as an example of greatness to all the humans he comes in contact with, but cyclically, the best of humanity itself serves as an example for the Doctor to live up to as well. It's been a persistent theme with the modern series for sure. It's why, after all, the Doctor travels with a human as a companion. It's been remarked often that his companions are his conscience, his moral compass. Are we forgetting so quickly the vast storyline about Rose making the Doctor ""a better *man*"" through their unconventional relationship? Come on now.

Also, just for the record, I wanna point out that you're trying to argue with one of the showrunners of the modern series on the subject of what the show is meant to be. Kind of a futile exercise, I find.

true,starbuck67,flair8,,"Actually this is what I am hoping will happen. The way we play at the moment the formation looks more like a 4-3-3 rather than the 4-4-2 that everybody is talking about.

With Sandro in the side it frees up Eriksen to roam and be creative (kind of what he has been doing lately especially against stoke where there wasn't much defending to do and united where Capoue screened the defence).

Furthermore while Lennon is playing I think Lamela gives the side an extra dimension. Lennon is the quintessential right winger he is fantastic down the right but rather average anywhere else. Lamela can play down the right (like he did for Roma) down left (he is naturally left sided) and through the middle (like he used to in Argentina). Lamela, Soldado and Adebayor would have the freedom of the top third drifting out wide and out of the pocket a bit deeper. Soldado and Adebayor have been doing this lately adding Lamela to the mix would make it a lot more dynamic.

The biggest problem I see is what to do with the wealth of midfielders. Paulinho, could replace Eriksen but that would alter the way we play it would give our midfield a more driving character but it may be more defensively solid.

Sorry for the wall of text I am on leave and have a lot of time to think about this.

1) The commute between Bristol and Bath is pretty easy, there is a direct train from Bristol temple meads to Bath Spa, its takes about 15 mins and costs around £5. At rush hour times it will be very busy. 

2) Bath is pretty expensive to live in, as is a lot of Bristol. If you are going to live in Bristol i suggest areas like Montpellier / Stokes Croft / St Werburghs / Maybe St Pauls (it can be a bit dodgey at times) these areas are about 20 mins walk from the train station and rent will be 300-400 a month. 

3) Its pretty normal for people to come into Bristol from Bath for a nightout.

4) Bristol has a pretty big climbing scene. Bristol Climbing Center in St Werburghs is amazing, its in an old church so the walls are really high. There is also a The Climbing Academy which is a good bouldering place. Also if you like outdoor climbing/bouldering then Avon Gorge has some great routes.  

5) I think 1600 a month should be fine. You wont be rolling init but you'll be comfortable enough.

The sword is a remake of a Claymore. 
  On the opposite wall is a Katana, and in each window recess are a pair of nunchuku - the Japanese weapons are from my time learning Jitsu with a bit of Kobudo thrown in, and the Claymore is more decorative than anything else. Not sharp. 
  Shinywise they're just 2 neon glow tubes bolted to the walls in the corners. I'm really into blue lights. Redundantly, I've also got blue LEDs fitted into the back of the TV unit which are virtually invisible when the neons are on, and I scavenged one of the strings of fairy lights to surround my Mario Kart figures. There's a PC which is linked up to the surround sound for behind the screen. I really want to fit [one of these] (http://www.amazon.co.uk/MDM04-Single-Monitor-Stand-Swivel/dp/B0036YMAXM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389348620&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=monitor+arm) so I can put the spare monitor next to it, but I just haven't got round to finding the right one and ordering it. There's a PS3 there, one in the spare room and one in the living room. Furniture - futon, coffee table, armchair.  
  I downgraded the screen from the 46er to a 32 and moved that to the living room over Christmas, and I think it's staying like that as I truly cannot be arsed to lift it back up 2 flights of stairs.

What this means is that while they are a none democratic body they can't actually *block* the democratic process. They can only advice and at most slow down changes in the law. This means they are only useful if they have a different set of priorities to the Commons and as soon as we start making it elected body we take away one of the main differences between them.

I missed curfew once when I got 'kidnapped' by a friends parent who took us out later (and I'd called home and got it okied).

My other friends had like 9pm curfews which they never stuck to and always got grounded but that never lasted!

After 18 I was allowed out until 2am (2.30am was club closing so leaving 30min early allowed for getting a taxi easily - my Dad really though it through!) and initially I was only allowed on once a month til this time. And I still stuck to this. 
I didn't have to say Hello to them but there was a lamp on the landing I had to switch off so if they woke in the night then they knew I was home.

I left home at about 22, I think the curfew stopped about 19/20ish but I still would switch the lamp off when I came home and if I said I'd be home and changed my mind I'd let them know via text. They didn't need to know but well it was polite - if my parents went out for an evening and didn't come home I'd be kinda worried too!

The best punishment for a hangover is to find one or more small children (works best with younger siblings (in my case foster siblings)), give them 50p and tell them to go and wake up the hungover teenager and then the teenage will take them to the park and they can buy sweeties!

Wrong. Like Reding, he was indirectly elected by Parliament. And I must remind you that he had to negotiate the support, not just of his own parliamentary party, but also of the Liberal Democrat MPs, to reach this position.

Let me rephrase my question: who elected Nick Clegg to be Vice Prime Minister?

Wrong again. Reding is a member of the centre-right European People's Party. Currently, the EPP is the biggest party in the European Parliament. However, if one of the other two main parties in the European Parliament (the Progressive Alliance of European Socialists and Democrats, to which Labour belongs, and the European Liberals, Democrats and Reformists, to which belong the LibDems) fares better in the upcoming election, Reding's position will certainly be on the block (since her Christian Democrats also lost the recent elections in her native Luxembourg, she normally won't be supported by her government in the Council either).

He simply isn't the player he was before his injury. He chases the ball too much instead of closing down channels, which didn't matter as much when he had recovery pace but now leaves us out against counters especially with Gerrard in the lineup (due to his lack of pace/positioning as well). 

People love to give Joe Allen stick for only playing short passes, but so does Lucas and then people trump up his pass percentage. I think a new defensive midfielder is the reds biggest need but until one is secured we are much better off playing Allen alongside Gerrard. He presses well, has more pace, keeps things ticking over, and can even offer an attacking edge.

I know this is an unpopular opinion amongst a lot of fans, but instead of simply down voting it try to convince me otherwise.

...

&gt;""I saw him [Duggan] turn around because someone was blocking him. He ran back. There were coppers about. They asked him 'put it down' or 'get down'.

A man, *who the police know for sure had at least one gun*, see him running away and then turn and run back towards them, ignoring their command, which the witness thought was either 'put it down' or 'get down'.

From the point of view of the police, it was perfectly reasonable to think that their lives were in danger, and they acted accordingly.  That's why what they did was considered lawful.

It seems to me that what happened is that Duggan understandably panicked, and it unfortunately cost him his life.

The problem when you start electing people all sorts of stuff follow.

For example:

Scenario 1) If the Lords is elected, then it would have to be possible for them to strike down laws rather then simply delay them. This leads to deadlock in the political system when there is a difference between the Lords (which with your idea would still consist of relatively wealthy individuals) and the Commons.

Scenario 2) With the Lords being elected, you would have to potentially be able to have a Government lead by a Lord. Technically the Queen chooses the Prime Minister, but what if the Commons vote for person X and the Lords vote that Lord Y should be Prime Minister? Right now the Commons is the ""more important"" House as it's the only one with a mandate, what of the other?

Scenario 3) You want the Lords to provide a counter balance to the adversarial and political Commons, but with elections official or unofficial political factions/parties form. How can rely on them to stay impartial, when they are thinking about potentially losing their job if they reject the ""Hang All Pedophiles Act"" as it is, in their considerable legal experience as one of the ""law specialists"" a bad idea?

Scenario 4) You put qualification requirements in place, and I am elected by the public to be a Lord.

You can google these news stories.

I think the EU is not realizing that Economic Migration is uni-directional in the EU. Secondly the EURO-CRISIS has increased the PUSH factors to more prosperous countries and outside the EU.

UK's 4 million increase in the population was the fastest increase in the population in 1,000 years or something crazy under Labour Government.

The UK has x3 average immigration rate; Highest Birthrate in the EU.

Open Borders also is biased to EU vs non-EU in terms of skilled-workforce that the UK wishes to pursue for it's economy.

Also: [German foreign minister attacks 'brainless Eurosceptics'](http://www.thelocal.de/20140109/german-foreign-minister-steinmeier-describes-eurosceptics-as-brainless)

The terms: ""populist"" could be interchangeable with ""democratic"". The euroskeptic parties are MORE DIVERSE than the pro-EU parties (which are increasingly anti-euroskeptic and not pro-EU in their messages).

The reason the EU officials want to NARROW the debate on migration is due to the ideology cornerstone of ""free labour, goods, services, capital"". But they continue to require NEW TREATIES because the old treaties are band-aids and so maybe the EU Officials need to revisit the sacred assumptions of the ""free movement of labour"" for eg in the EU?

BROADENING the discussion on immigration to INCLUDE the differences between the countries and the rates, land mass, direction, economic selection of skill-sets required and implications on peripheral countries as well as core countries I think would be far more productive than the slandering being resorted to.

Bear in mind the former statement from an EU official explicitly dealing with Britain's unique situation:

&gt;*""Britain’s welfare system is too generous and is to blame for attracting a growing number of migrant workers from poorer EU nations, the EU’s justice commissioner said as Brussels pushed back against a UK campaign to restrict the free movement of the bloc’s citizens.
Viviane Reding said on Thursday that it was up to the UK to tighten up its own benefits rules, arguing that EU laws granted London ample space to take action to stop welfare fraud committed by foreign nationals.""*

true,Garianto,null,null,"Based on my various (drunk) experiences in the past 2 years as an undergrad:-

Cowgate/Oldtown area - generally cheaper/less posh; (Free - £6 entry)

**Hive** - the oxymoronic guy, shitest of shite, but everyone ends up there. An Edinburgh staple.                
**Cab Vol** - midrange, prices vary but it was pretty good when I went there once for Hector's House-(music) (Tuesdays I think?)                                                                                                                       
**Opium** - Alternative/Metal music, not my cuppa tea but each to their own.                                          
**Bongo** - one of the more expensive on Cowgate, but when I went there it was hip-hop/house/trance or something and it was bouncin'. Had a great night.                                                                             
**Silk** - Temple Thursdays are £1 drinks and across 3 floors its quite extensive. Prone to getting crowded though.    
**Cav** (Tollcross) - just about the only place that has people in on Sundays, prices are decent. Arguably has the largest floorspace of any club in Edinburgh (maybe City or Bongo or Silk)                                                 
**City** - Full of chavs and brawls, don't go there.

George Street - more expensive/classier (£5 -£10+ entry)                                                                      
For the George Street places that are open all week, I wouldn't go on Sundays/Mondays/Tuesdays, they're prone to being dead empty then.

**Why Not** - not too fond of Why Not, quite small and you're not allowed drink on the dancefloor I'm pretty sure (what's up with that?)                                                                                                                
**Shanghai** - love the interior, not been there much though.                                                                      
**Opal** - A lot of people complain about Opal but I like it actually, drinks are decently priced for George Street and always seems to have a good crowd there.                                                                                    
**Lulu's** - Dancefloor was pathetically small when I went there but I've not been since the refurbishment, so it might be better now.

At lunchtime I wandered around the canteen looking for a vegetarian option, and someone pointed me in the direction of the ubiquitous veg lasagne. As I stood in the queue I was quite amazed at just how much lasagne there was, all piled up behind the person serving, and the queue behind me gradually became enormous. ""Wow, lots of vegetarians here, "" I thought. And when I got my serving I was a bit disheartened at how huge it was, because any kind of veggie pasta in a canteen is almost always completely shit. 

So I sat down with my friends and I sighed as I started eating what is probably the billionth veg lasagne of my life. Well dear reader, what can I say. The first mouthful made me feel like Michel Roux Jr tasting some exquisite 3 star michelin dish. Absolutely gorgeous. Every vegetable full of flavour, not a hint of sogginess, phenomenal cheese sauce, no hint of meat juice or chicken stock that usually finds its way into the veg option when it comes to european restaurants. Absolutely amazing, and if I hadn't been surrounded by people I would have licked the plate clean.

So yeah, the EU make the most amazing goddamn veg lasagne but they are truly, truly, TRULY shit at dealing with what is a very straightforward request by the UK to negotiate some of the really bad stuff about the EU and leave all the good things so that, y'know, we don't vote to leave.",0,1389355654,null,0,false,0,cem2oj4,t3_1uviq6,t1_cem2oj4,t3_1uviq6,null,1431881495,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Take out debt on a credit card and when it's reaching the end of the interest free period, transfer it to another.

On paper it sounds like a brilliant idea - he would have been earning good money on an oil rig so he could save every penny he earned and do something else with it, without worrying too much about the credit card debt. 

Only one minor problem - if it suddenly became difficult to arrange a 0% balance transfer, all this debt would rapidly start to attract interest at credit card rates - which are usually pretty eye-watering. Needless to say, a black mark on your credit file has exactly this effect.

I was born as a child of an Englishman and a immigrant from the former USSR. I spent the entirety of school among 2nd/3rd generation Indians and Pakistanis, my first job (a paper round) was afforded to me by the Indian guy: ""Sam"" who ran my corner shop. In my teens I'd play chess and smoke weed with the well spoken Indian immigrant who ran the local post office.  
I acted in plays throughout my youth with people all over Europe, I joined a dance crew with a 1st generation immigrant pinoy, a 2nd generation Zambian and another guy of Caribbean origin.  
I've worked professionally across the globe with French, Icelanders, Swedes, Poles, Germans, Indians, Chinese and Pakistanis. I worked for a British company that was bought out by a French company and helped their transition period.  
I have friends that I feel more close to than the government all across the globe both inside and outside the EU.

Surely this perspective of mine is far from unique as an Englishman. What is it about the beauty of immigration and the shitness of nation states that others fail to see? I just don't understand why this narrative has recently gained so much traction.

Britain _is_ immigration, Britain is and always has been International. Why do these politicians attack the very essence of our country?

Free labour movement across the EU is the _best_ thing that has happened to our peoples for a very, very long time. It frees the young generation (who have no baggage or less baggage to carry) to experience Europe to its fullest and brings us all closer together. The mere existence of immigrants in the UK helps the UK create economic and cultural ties to those countries of origin. While Immigrants that offer cheaper services might provide competition to current local providers its worth noting that these services will be bought by Brits for a lesser price as well. The pressure on wages/service costs is not a zero-sum game, money doesn't disappear and with interest rates the way they are now its often re-invested ASAP.

true,Neralo,lfc68,,"Article by David Usher, writing for ESPN 

&gt;Liverpool travel to Stoke City this weekend as the club that launched Michael Owen's career takes on the side where it all ended for him. Owen achieved some truly great things in his career, scoring goals for fun and winning plenty of trophies while playing for three of the biggest clubs in the world. Yet he is not truly embraced by the fans of any club he ever played for, particularly Liverpool. 

&gt;Owen also had spells at Real Madrid, Newcastle United and Manchester United of course, but Liverpool are the club with which he is most closely associated. After exploding onto the scene as a jet-heeled teen, Owen went on to achieve a great deal in his time at Anfield, both in terms of team success and personal accolades, not least when he won the Ballon d'Or in 2001 after helping Liverpool achieve a historical cup treble. That season alone should have ensured that Owen never had to buy himself a drink on Merseyside ever again, yet if you were to ask most Liverpool fans to name their ten least favourite former players, Owen's name would make an awful lot of those lists. 

&gt;Few Kopites have any affection left for their former striker these days, and views on Owen tend to vary between mild indifference to utter contempt. Personally, I'm at the ""indifference"" end of the scale as I have far too many fond memories to be able to bring myself to truly dislike Owen, although I fully understand how others can. The perception of Owen is of a self-centred, career-driven individual who never seemed to care too much about any club he played for, not even Liverpool with whom he enjoyed the best days of his career. 

&gt;Rightly or wrongly, many fans suspected that Owen was more concerned with his international career and his ""brand"" than he was with Liverpool Football Club. Despite having come up through the club's junior ranks, he wasn't seen as being as much of a ""Red"" as the likes of Jamie Carragher, Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard, and as a result, was never really held in the same esteem despite always giving his best on the field. The way his career path went in comparison to his three pals suggests that the fans were right to doubt his commitment to the cause. Acting in the best interests of ""Team Owen"" may have paid off in terms of his resume, medal haul and bank balance, but as the Black Eyed Peas famously asked, ""where is the love?"".

&gt;It's not just the Kop that don't look on him favourably. Manchester United fans couldn't care less about him, Newcastle's ""Toon Army"" really don't like him much at all, Real Madrid fans probably look at him in much the same way as Liverpudlians view David N'Gog (with indifference), while the Stoke faithful hardly saw him on the field and presumably have no real opinion on him one way or the other. For all his talent, all his goals and all his achievements, Owen isn't loved by the fans of any team he played for. That's a sad and dubious honour that not many players can lay claim to.

&gt;Liverpool fans' beef with Owen dates back to when he left to join Real Madrid in August 2004. He had let his contract run down and there were just 12 months left on his deal, meaning LFC were not in much of a bargaining position when Madrid made their move. Owen left to win trophies, but ironically Liverpool won the Champions League while he was struggling to get in the Madrid side, and a year later he was ready to return to Anfield, tail between legs. 

&gt;The Reds were prepared to take him back but only at a sensible price. After all, he'd left Anfield for the derisory sum of eight million pounds, plus Antonio Nunez (so basically somewhere near six million pounds) and Liverpool were not looking to spend too much more than that to get him back. Madrid wanted a reported 12 million pounds, but Newcastle -- keen to make a big splash in the transfer market and attract a marquee player -- came wading in with a ludicrous 18 million pound offer. Real couldn't believe their luck, but Owen was not so thrilled. 

&gt;Desperate calls were made on Owen's behalf to then Liverpool Chief Executive Rick Parry in a vain attempt to coax the Reds into upping their offer, but Liverpool wanted Owen to tell the Spanish giants that he was only interested in a return to Merseyside and Newcastle's offer was therefore irrelevant. Had he done that, Madrid would have then been faced with either keeping a player they didn't really want and who didn't want to be there, or to sell for the best price they could get. 

&gt;Instead, Owen reluctantly agreed to join Newcastle and before he knew it he was being whisked off in a helicopter and paraded on live TV on a stage at St James' Park in front of thousands of over-excited Geordies. He made a fortune out of that move and gave very little back on the field in return, as much of his time in the North East was spent on the treatment table. In his final season at St James' Park, he even captained the side to relegation, but ""Brand Owen"" was never going to play in the Championship.

&gt;Initially, there appeared to be little interest in him. Then came the infamous ""brochure"", one of the most cringe-worthy things I can remember seeing associated with a top footballer. Once again, Owen was pushing for a move back to Liverpool and both Gerrard and Carragher put a word in for him with Rafa Benitez, only for the Spaniard to go in another direction. Owen, of course, ended up at Manchester United and for some Liverpool fans that meant that his final Anfield bridge had now been burned. For others -- myself included -- it was an unpalatable but understandable move. Owen hadn't turned down Liverpool to join United; he joined United because Liverpool didn't want him.

&gt;Joining United wasn't the straw that broke the camel's back for me. It was the complete lack of respect he showed Liverpool fans in comments he made after making the move to Old Trafford. In a futile attempt to ingratiate himself with the fans of his new club, Owen completely alienated the remaining Liverpool fans who still had any time for him. It was unnecessary and classless. I'd like to think he regrets it now, but who knows.

&gt;For such a smart lad, Owen has made some terrible decisions. Either that, or he has the worst advisors in football. How can a player who scored as many goals as he did be so unloved by the fans of every team he played for? I mean, it's not like he's a bad guy. Far from it. He's had no off-the-field controversies, was always a model professional, never fell out with team-mates or managers and when fit, he invariably delivered the goods. Yet players with not even a shred of his ability or professionalism get much more love from the fans of all of his former clubs. 

&gt;As a rule, once you have played for LFC you're a ""Red for life"", you only have to look on Twitter to see evidence of that. Players such as Luis Garcia, Didi Hamann, Titi Camara, Djimi Traore, Patrik Berger, Erik Meijer, Dani Pacheco, etc all still follow the club's fortunes closely; all appreciate that they were privileged enough to have worn the famous red shirt and all enjoy a good relationship with the fans. Compare that with Owen, perhaps the most mocked footballer on social media.

&gt;Owen is in an elite group of former players who were not warmly received when they returned to Anfield with their new club: Fernando Torres, Stan Collymore, El Hadji Diouf and Paul Ince are in that group too for varying reasons, while Steve McManaman's return wasn't as welcoming as it could have been either. When Owen returned to Liverpool as a Newcastle player, he wasn't booed, but he was taunted with chants of ""Where were you in Istanbul?""

&gt;I have no idea if Owen regrets any of the decisions he made during his career, or if he wishes he'd handled certain things differently. I'd like to think so, and if he does, then he should say so. I'm sure there are still plenty of supporters like myself who still want to think fondly of him and to remember him for the important goals that brought trophies to the club, but he has made it almost impossible to do that.

&gt;It could be that he doesn't care what people think and is happy with his lot in life. After all, he had a great career, he's got a loving family, more money than he'll ever need, a new career in punditry and he's got his beloved race horses. Life is pretty good for Michael Owen, but there surely must be a small part of him that sees how so many former LFC players (who achieved far less than he did) are treated like prodigal sons and held in such high esteem by the fans, and wishes he had some of that too.",0,1389357621,null,0,false,0,cem313c,t3_1uvm7l,t1_cem313c,t3_1uvm7l,null,1431881654,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

The premise of pensions mean that you always need a _much_ larger tax paying population than the pensionable population otherwise the system falls apart.

Introducing extra ""stake-holders"" [ie. people who need to make a profit from the system] is also an incredibly stupid idea, or it would be if the intent was purely to make the NHS effective. 

What gets overlooked in all of this is that politicians are generally quite competent.

That's it, really. Nation states keep wages high in some places and wages low in the others. That's one reason why people want to move from, say, Romania to Britain. In Britain, wages are higher, and there is better government institutions, such as the NHS. That both increases the amount of competition in the UK, driving down wages, and reduces the amount of skilled workers in places like Romania. 

Now, is making our borders even tighter the answer? No. That still keeps the problem of wages and services being better in the UK. We need more international integration, with nations working closer together to increase equality. I see no reason why I, someone born in Britain, has more of a right to the benefits of living in Britain than somebody living in a foreign country. This doesn't mean I think everyone should move to the UK to have those benefits, rather we should make efforts to make the quality of life better in those countries. 

All nation states do is increase inequality between humans and allow international companies to play different countries off each other, driving down wages and quality of life.

Court 11 was busy with POLICE CONSTABLE DAVID EVANS, DETECTIVE CONSTABLE CHRISTOPHER CARTER, and DETECTIVE CONSTABLE LEONARD GERRARD all charged with the theft of ecstasy tablets. The drugs with a street value of £500,000 (40,000 tablets), were to be sold on the streets to junkies and pushers.
Court 17 was busy with POLICE CONSTABLE ANDREW WIGLEY and POLICE CONSTABLE SIMON WILSON, both charged with aggravated assault and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Wigley was accused of helping Wilson to cover up the crime by falsifying his notes.
Court 18 was busy with POLICE CONSTABLE RICHARD SAMS and WOMAN POLICE CONSTABLE PATRICIA McGOVERN who were charged with false imprisonment and attempting to pervert the course of justice. They are said to have stopped a motorist late at night and said he was in the bus lane. An arrest followed in which Constable Sams assaulted the man occasioning actual bodily harm.

* Doesn't want to speak about Rooney. Play them in a few days, not nice to talk about their players.

* Doesn't think united have a problem. They qualify for last 16 of champions league, important objective. They lost in FA cup but lost against a premier league team. Not in premier league at the moment but might be at the end of the season. Better results will arrive for them.

* We have a chance to win tomorrow. Very difficult match based on his analysis but we have a chance to win. Most important thing for us is to secure a position in the top four. Improving and preparing the team.

* KdB has a chance to go. There have been a few proposals. One is coming to a place where it is a good position for both player and club. We have to analyse a player's personality. He wants very much to go. Good deal for Chelsea financially.

* A month since they have had a week to train. Players had a day off. A little bit more time for the recovery of Lampard and Ivanovic. Not ready to come back.

* Some of the oldest players are playing at a very good level. Evolution of players like Terry from last year. Younger players are coming into another dimension. 

* No fee agreed for De Bruyne, can't confirm but the interest is big from the other club and the player. We will lose a player who we feel is good. Few weeks until transfer takes place. Door is open to negotiate because it is a position where we have options.

* No truth to Hazard to PSG. Not worried about losing him. His value is crazy, doubled to tripled in value since he was bought for 40mil for Chelsea.

* It is a different challenge to last time.

* Title still open for Man United. If they win 5 matches in a row they could challenge.

* Transfer window is a distraction if you want to be distracted. It is not a bad thing for clubs and players who aren't happy with their situation. Two weeks should be enough.

* Too many foreigners as managers in premier league. Feels sorry for the English managers who deserve an opportunity.

* Zero bids for any other players in the first team squad.

* Two clubs in for De Bruyne.

true,NuttyFanboy,silence,Silence,"The problem as I see it has many facets:

- the radical change of style from Series 5 onwards. New showrunner, new Doctor, and a different way of storytelling came together in one storm. I suspect that was a bit much to take for people who started with Ecclestone or Tennant.  

- Matt Smith, or rather his portrayal of the Doctor. Personally, he resonated the most with me of all Doctors - insofar that he repeatedly did stuff where I thought ""damn, I could've come up with that/done that"". Among my friends, I call Eleven the 'Aspie Doctor'. A number of friends never really warmed up to Eleven (whereas I really took to him) - they say he's too successful for being that geeky and awkward and can't seem to reconcile these aspects of his personality.  
- Moffats penchant for long arcs, obscure details and a tendency to leave it to the viewer to read between the lines in many cases. A whole lot of people want all tied up in a neat, tidy package, everything explained and not be left hanging at the end of a story.  
He throws in a lot of references and pieces into episodes that might lead somewhere, and picks up on some and ignores/discards others. I feel like that rubs some people the wrong way, and it is something I can understand - it sort of creates a rather rushed feel in storytelling, especially coupled with the fact that there are only 13 episodes a series (plus 1-2 specials).

Combine these three points and the fact that Moffat is the current showrunner, and he's the automatic lightning rod for any fan who feels he was wronged.

We even owned a great deal of France at one time, in fact we sold it back to the French to pay for a war with the Ottomans.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"Whether or not the enforcement of FFP will be strong is not yet known, but there are good reasons for supporting it. In fact, Chelsea are among the PL clubs to actually come out and [publicly support FFP](http://www.chelseafc.com/chelsea-article/article/2926623), in contrast to Manchester City.

&gt;Chelsea Football Club has already made it clear we are in favour of financial stability being promoted on the European stage, and our general support is extended to the Premier League, despite some reports to the contrary.

&gt;'From Chelsea's point of view, we have been working very hard to comply with FFP criteria,' says Chief Executive Ron Gourlay.

&gt;'We are still very much in favour of rules promoting financial stability in clubs and protecting the long-term future of football across Europe.

&gt;We have been very active commercially as we strive to meet the obligations of FFP,' explains Gourlay.

&gt;'We added several new global partners to our portfolio over the summer and we have been exploring naming rights. These are part of ensuring we can balance the relevant football income with the relevant football expenses.

To me, this indicates that FFP *does* indeed mean something to Chelsea. Yes, that includes a slew of commercial deals such as those you mentioned; but as the largest frequent expenses for a football club, player transfers play a big role. And no, not every club can emulate Manchester United's strategy; companies won't offer comparable mega sponsorships to clubs with less exposure, which for now includes all other PL clubs. Furthermore, sources of revenue such as TV money differ between clubs like Chelsea, City, and PSG. For example, Chelsea has been in the CL for more than a decade and progressed to the knock-out stages nearly every time, a significant source of added revenue. Man City and PSG have not, and as such their FFP situation is a lot more tenuous than ours. In addition, they have signed a lot of players on huge contracts following the FFP monitoring period, whereas some of Chelsea's biggest contracts are exempt as they were signed before. 

The net result of these and many other factors is that not only is Chelsea well on its way to satisfying FFP regulations (despite the media narrative that we are 'struggling'), but also that **it is in Chelsea's best interest to support FFP** as it reinforces its position of dominance while making it difficult for clubs newer to the scene such as City ans PSG.

His ability is great (he won PoTY two seasons in a row, whether or not you think he deserved it) and only looks like improving. He is not far behind Suarez' ability and could well exceed it if he keeps improving like he has these last few years.

Suarez is a well known dirty player, with plenty of incidents that would be a nightmare for any organization to be associated with, let alone a club of that stature. Handball in the world cup, biting twice, allegedly racist remarks. His loyalty of course has to be questioned, he did try to leave in the summer.

true,delawana,null,null,"There are a few things that are sort of difficult. One thing is very philosophical: ""what is information? and how does that differ from knowledge?"" and so on. When we say that, as librarians we provide information, we want to know what we actually mean.

As far as real difficulties, libraries are constantly fighting to prove their usefulness. In Canada, many libraries' budgets have been cut since they're seen as non-essential. So libraries have had to try and provide many more services than simply lending books. This hasn't been too much of a problem, since librarians love technology because it allows information to be spread so efficiently, but it's awful to constantly have to prove that libraries are actually important services. When it comes to academic libraries (like in a college or university) funding is often a big problem because of the same issue. Administrators don't always realize just how much libraries do, so if the institution needs to cut their budget, the library is one of the first things they decrease funding to.

Those are some of the difficulties of libraries, but I should also mention that a degree in Library and Information Studies (I think that it's just Library Studies in the US) doesn't necessarily mean that a graduate would have to only be a librarian. We study how information works, as well as how to manage an institution, so our degrees are very, very flexible, and our job market isn't solely in libraries. It is also in any organization large enough to need some kind of knowledge management; law firms, corporations, hospitals, security agencies, etc. The degree can even help with things like web design: how should you put together a web page to maximize the spread of information?

true,norney,null,null,"The credit reference system has some very serious flaws. People can publish lies about you and you have effectively no control over it, short of spending 16 years and £250k. In the end it took 6 years to remove the records from my experian and equifax files, by which time they would have been removed naturally anyway. Here's my story of very similar circumstances:

I bought a kitchen at a well-known DIY chain with orange lettering, because it was the right product at the right price and they promised a specific delivery date. They offered me an attractive credit deal, and I accepted it. In the event it turned out they'd lied about the delivery date, so I called the store to cancel the agreement. They said it had been cancelled, and I received in the post a refund receipt for the value of the kitchen. The receipt had a credit card number on it, which I queried as I had not used a card to purchase the goods. The store assured me, in writing, that this was an internal process and all was well. I forgot about it all and moved on. 

Six months later I received payment demands from the credit company saying the interest free period had expired and I had to start making payments. Hilarity ensued. 

By this time the DIY store said they had deleted the records of the affair, being that they are only allowed to keep the records for 6 months, and the credit company said they had no record of the cancellation, nor would they discuss it with the DIY store for 'data protection reasons'. They would not accept the correspondence and refund receipt from the DIY store.

Neither party would take responsibility and by now my credit records showed a defaulted debt. Neither equifax nor experian would do anything more than allow me to add a note to my records, which in itself severely adversely affects credit worthiness. 

Because of the incompetence of others, my credit record was severely tainted for 6 years. There was nothing at all I could do about it. I even made a complaint to the information commissioner who pretty much told me they weren't interested, and even my local MP said not much more than ""ooh it's terrible, innit?""

Sorry for wall of text, but this story brought back stressful memories. The system allows big companies to be incompetent with impunity.

The system changed because the system could not deal with a sudden increase in rent and as you were the one getting the money this was your problem.  You could do this if you thought a tennant was claiming HB and wanted to get 'get rid of the scrounger' in much the same way that agencies or landlords can just say ""No DSS"" these days. 

In theory if paid directly to the agent or LL then them wanting to put the rent up is largely nothing to do with you, it's between them and the benefits office, which avoided that problem but left it wide open for the current one (as stated, won't let to people on benefits). 

There were minor instances of people spending the money on things other than the rent for a number of reasons (some valid like cost of living increases and some not like holidays) I admit.

* This island still has a ton of room. We can house millions more people if current landowners would allow us to build more properties. You know the Common Agricultural Policy in Europe? We use waaaaaaay more farmland than we need. This could all be housing and parks.
* We need immigration to maintain our dwindling/stagnant population while still being able to meet our present and future pension obligations (pensions by definition require population growth).  
* A lot of population projections have world population peaking at 10 billion once affluence increases across the globe (affluence negatively correlates with # of children, the less affluent the more children, this is a reason why we don't make enough children).
* Since automation and the industrial revolution we need people. We've created a very large service industry and new industries constantly form. Software and computer hardware and huge swathe of jobs that come from providing those services (you still need unskilled people to man phones or test software or deal with clients). The internet allows us to sell across the globe so as long as companies within our country post revenue we have the funds within the country to employ people. Think beyond factory workers please.
* Countries like Norway and Sweden are about a fifth of the size of the UK economy and Norway has its oil that artificially bloats their economy. It's worth noting that while the geographic size of Norway and Sweden are large most of that land is not arable and almost all of the north is hard to populate extensively (unless you like crazy sub-temperatures, wind and lack of light).

&gt; we can make food, grow crops, mine resources and even perform police work with less and less people

Yes we can. But what happens to the saved money? People aren't burning it. They'll spend it on a nicer hair-cut, a faster car, a shinier button its up to every generation to find means of making a living and offering services that people want and that's where the money goes.

&gt; no matter how hard working and efficient Germans are, they will never be more hard working and efficient than the robots that will replace them.

Its fine. Automating idiot work is great because those jobs are beneath humans. As I stated before the saved money will go into new industries that will be created due to the surplus of cash the owners of the robots will gain. Robots will only ever be able to perform the most straight-forward of tasks, the tasks that require intelligent contextualised thought will always be available and always require humans.

## Edit
### The Article Is Made-up Bollocks

The main point of [**the report**](http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/10287-001-accommodation-for-asylum-seekers-Book.pdf) is that G4S and Serco took too long to provide property, the property was below standard and they failed several performance indicators.

The article doesn't mention this until paragraph eleven, and doesn't mention it again.

And the report makes **no mention of** tablets, mobile phones or televisions; It just says in a single paragraph on p39, that:
&gt; ""In some of these, it was clear that the occupants may have a level of income above that expected of someone receiving the minimum level of support"".

The idea the the asylum seekers even _had_ tablets, TVs and phones is pure conjecture, and only appears in Sky's article:

&gt; Housing officers who saw evidence of wealth, such as tablet computers or expensive plasma screen televisions, suggesting a high level of income, have a duty to inform the Home Office within a day.

It might be true, but it's not supported by anything in the report.

You might just as well write ""**evidence of wealth, such as a publishing empire, several television networks, film studios and two private jets**"" and have people believing asylum seekers are as loaded as Rupert bloody Murdoch. It doesn't make it true.

true,guyintheuk,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"Maybe, in an ideal world, you are right. However that misses some of the compensating factors :-

1. The fact the the UK government is both the health service regulator and, through the NHS, the health service provider gives rise to many conflicts of interests and inefficiencies.

1. The NHS is a huge organisation with a huge management structure is a massive drain on resources. By rightsizing (such as in the German and other EU systems) the management overhead is limited.

1. In the system I described there is no approval or chasing up bills because you swipe your medical card when you go to the doctor and that is all that is needed to generate payment from the 'krankenkasse'.

1. Much of the frontline work is done by doctors practices (including specialist consultations) where any 'profits' are, in effect, part of the doctors salary. They remain competitive to retain their patients/clients. They operate very much like solicitors practices in the UK. 

1. The health insurance providers in Germany are non-governmental not-for-profit organisations [AOK - the biggest German Health Insurer](http://www.aok-bv.de/imperia/md/aokbv/aok/aokbv_info_2012_engl_311012.pdf) that administer the funding of the health system as their specialist role. This allows them to look at long term costs and reduce these through health prevention programs. They have also introduced efficiencies though various measures such as more logical prescription package sizing.

1. Germany spends roughly 2% more of GDP on healthcare than the UK but, from personal experience, I can tell you that timely access to services and quality of care feel significantly better than that.

I have been using Germany as a model for illustration but they are, by no means, unique. Services in other EU countries work in a similar way. 

I feel sorry for the poor, overworked NHS staff trying their best to provide a good service against odds. They are underfunded to start with and and much of what is spent is wasted on inefficiencies before it reaches the sharp end. 

I would much rather have the NHS than no universal health but it is struggling too much for resources to achieve all that it should  ",0,1389368383,null,0,false,0,cem63uu,t3_1utjew,t1_cem63uu,t1_cem0hmw,null,1431883229,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; but instead they opened up the borders and now big businesses is rubbing their hands together at the downward pressure on wages meanwhile natives are having to live on handouts and subsidies to survive.

NO. Just no.

The reason the working population is fucked over the government is economic obsession with growth. Growth helps people with money, growth does not directly help the working class. The governments of Europe have sold out their people chasing growth and we'd do well to blame the correct class (the political class) for this instead of immigrants. Most immigrants are people just like us (trying to struggle by while additionally trying to live in a foreign country) the political class are much less so, so please direct that blame and that uncomfortable feeling elsewhere.

Its worth noting that our borders were more open prior to the banking crisis when the population was sold out to the banks. Recently we've tightened the controls so I don't buy this big business narrative on immigration.

&gt; If you go to your doctors and it's full of people speaking foreign languages what are you supposed to think?

I live in London? This is what London has been like for quite a while, perhaps you're experiencing a transition in the borough you live in?  
What you're supposed to think is that these people need access to our services and haven't mastered English yet. You wouldn't be as pissed if the people in your way were English, right?  
Why make the assumption that you're more entitled to the services than they are? You don't know what jobs they perform, who their family is or even why they're here. They could be families of doctors or fleeing persecution or war in their own country, why assume the worst?

There has never been hysteria over GPs mistreating their patients, putting dollar bags over their heads and pulling out their gold teeth. No one seems bothered that they can choose to go to Specsavers, Scrivens, Vision Express, Tesco, Boots, D&amp;A, Asda, Costco, Optical Express and others to get their eyes seen over.

&gt;-CGI should always take a backseat to better writing and acting. I'm fine with it being poor, sometimes that makes the writers come up with interesting ways to make it better.

That's fine, but not when it's in stark contrast to the usual CGI in the series, i.e the planetary bodies look great, yet some monsters are a mess. It's like going to an art museum, looking at all this amazing art with it's incredible brush strokes and detail, before seeing a shitty child's drawing on the wall that clearly has nothing else going for it. It just doesnt work and more so, it's ill fitting for the circumstance.

&gt;The only explanation I have for that is that they were weak and maybe they couldn't send people through time. Maybe it was easier to just kill them.

If you have to make your own excuses for a show bringing a huge chang to something that was a valuable point of interest for fans without explaining it, is it really fair on the viewer?

&gt; -River saw herself with the Doctor later that day. She knew that she wouldn't kill him since she already saw herself with him without the hat. Plus its just for comedy.

Ask yourself, if you'd still be okay with something like that were you travelling with the doctor.

&gt; -As far as the doctor always having the perfect solution, yeah that does kinda suck. But at the same time it probably wouldn't work any other way. Even if in an episode he did mess up royally he would just have to fix it in the next. Plus I'd rather not see Depressed Doctors as much as fun loving ones.

But does it always have to be a DEM? It's also a stroke of luck or similar, there really ought to be a wide set of small victories, large failings and vice versa littered around.

**5. Form against Top Teams**

There was a table posted a few weeks ago of a head-to-head of the top 7 teams, with Liverpool being 5th, having won only 1 of 6. That said, 5 of those games were away - our form against the top teams hasn't been great away, but they've all got to come to Anfield this year. 

**EDIT:** *[I found that table.](http://i.imgur.com/oSUJRLT.jpg) Turns out we actually won 2 of 6!*

Also bear in mind that we gave a number of those teams a run for their money, and in some of them you could argue we should have won (were it not for refereeing displays).

**4. Over-reliance on Luis Suarez**

This is true to a point, but once again Sturridge seems to have been forgotten about. 22 goals in 30 games (in all competitions) since joining Liverpool is an incredible scoring record - I imagine that without Suarez he'd be getting far more praise than he is. Likewise, I imagine that without Suarez we'd still be okay for goals, though it's undeniable that we would miss him should he get injured or banned.

**3. The Three Musketeers**

Not really sure what the point here is - if anything, it seems like something in our favour. Surely three other teams challenging for the title means that there are three teams that can all drop points against each other? If we only had one team to worry about, they'd be favourites to win all of the '6 point' matches, meaning it'd be harder to catch them if anything. Of course I may have misunderstood the point the author was making here.

**2. Away Form**

See point #5. Of the ten games we've played away, *half* of those were against the top sides. Two of those (City, Chelsea) you could argue we should have won, and certainly should have taken at least a point.

**1.  Title-Winning Experience**

This is a fair point - not much to say here. 

All in all, you can argue some of these points, but by manipulating them and adjusting the stats and figures you could show the same about the other title contenders. Realistically, I don't think we do have it in us to win the league this year, but it's been a very unusual season - I wouldn't write us off just yet.

&gt; Tim Sherwood insists Erik Lamela will not be leaving Tottenham on loan this month, but he admits he only intends play the Argentine “when he’s ready to perform”.
&gt; 
&gt; There has been speculation about Lamela’s future this week after his father told Fox Sports Radio del Plata: “Erik is not happy and he wants to go back to Italy.”
&gt; 
&gt; A loan move away from White Hart Lane has been mooted, but Sherwood is adamant that will not be happening.
&gt; 
&gt; “He has a big future here, he won’t be leaving on loan in this transfer window,” said the head coach.
&gt; 
&gt; “We know what a talented player Erik is and we do also understand how players need time to settle. He needs time to acclimatise to this country.
&gt; 
&gt; “He doesn’t speak English and isn’t used to the pace of the games, especially over the Christmas period when they come thick and fast.
&gt; 
&gt; “He’s not 100 per cent fit. He’s still feeling fatigued in one of his thighs so we were very cautious with him. We don’t want that to turn into a real injury problem.

No, their current phone works just fine. 

But its seen as and advertised as a status symbol, it's implied that now the new phone is out if you pull an old one out of your pocket people will look down on you, girls (or boys) won't want to be with you, you aren't hip and happening. 

So the answer to your question is: the exact same people who are buying them now but really shouldn't be.  The exact same people who go to companies like Brighthouse for their TV.

they can start a business, get higher tier work, take low paid work, or experience being poor like everyone else, let me counter this by asking why the working class should effectively subsidise a middle class by not enjoying the benefits of more economic efficiency.

&gt;And the 'means to an end' comment is exactly the reason why this notion of people doing whatever they like and not working is ridiculous.

it's only ridiculous while the work needs to be done, when a machine can do it for cheaper the work doesnt need doing and it is then a total waste of time and effort.

&gt;The reason why people do hobbies is because they're fun and act as a reward for performing work.

so why cant people spend their time doing this kind of thing exactly?

&gt;people are going to get mighty bored of playing video games, reading books, and traveling all day every day.

because menial work that could be performed by a machine is so much more rewarding than doing things that interest you?

true,insoundfromwayout,null,null,"Andrew Mitchell was the chief whip, and he was riding his bike the short distance down downing street from no.9 to the main gates. Downing street is for the most part pedestrian only, meaning that if you want to be a real prick about it, you shouldn't *technically* be riding a bike down there. (EDIT: the argument was technically about riding the bike through the *gates*, I made a mistake, see /u/whencanistop 's correction below) The policeman at the gates *did* want to be a real prick about it, and so told Mitchell to get off his bike. There was a very brief exchange of words, exactly what was said is disputed, but Mitchell admits that he swore.

A minor, forgettable incident between a stuck up copper and a stuck up bicyclist. You'd think it would just end there and everyone would forget about it... but it didn't.

The police that had been at the gates went away and wrote false statements really hamming up what had happened, hoping to get the minister in trouble. They exaggerated things he said; 

&gt;""The official police log of the incident states that Mitchell said ""Best you learn your fucking place. You don't run this fucking government ... You're fucking plebs. It was also alleged that he informed a police officer, ""I'll have your fucking job for this""""

and so on.

The papers ate it up, made him out to be some nasty old Tory looking down on everybody, its became a big media circus and he eventually couldn't do his job any more and was forced to resign.

Even when he resigned, he refused to admit that he had called them 'plebs' and so on, which was making things worse. People were saying that he should just confess to it and get on with life, why keep fighting it? Like this now beautiful line from The Chairman of the Met; """"It is not the words, police officers are quite thick skinned, what infuriates me here is that a minister [Andrew Mitchell] is saying police officers are liars.""

The coppers had him fitted up perfectly. They had multiple statements all saying the same thing from the police that were there at the time, another officer claimed to be an eyewitness, they said that there was this big fight, and that there had been pedestrians and tourists standing by who were visibly shocked, it was all made up into a huge deal. Who are you going to believe, multiple police accounts and eye witness statements, or one single MP who is in a lot of trouble and trying to worm his way out of it?

But, a journalist managed to find CCTV that showed the incident. It turns out there was no one else there, no eyewitness, no tourists, no pedestrians, and that Mitchell only passed them for a moment, so there was no time to exchange anything more than a few words, let alone have a big argument. 

So, against all the odds, it turns out the minister was right, and the police had been framing him for a crime that he didn't commit, and they had done it so well that he had lost his job.

So, it's not the fact that he called them a pleb that is the problem. The reason the public is concerned with this case is that because of a very minor few words, multiple police officers were willing to frame a high up government minister for something that never happened, got him removed from government, and very nearly got away with it. 

The speed at which it happened, the fact that no officer reported anything, the fact that the officers were able to find other officers to back them up, and the fact that it was all triggered by something so insignificant is indicative that it is a systemic problem, a 'culture of corruption'. That is, it seems like an officer can walk into a police station and say to a few others ""hey, do you mind writing an eyewitness report for me, this bloke was acting like a real prick today and I want to get him in trouble"" and that other officers will gladly comply and no one else who sees anything or hears anything reports it. The police of course say that this is not the case, and that these few officers involved happen to be a few bad apples, and no one else saw anything or heard anything while they were planning to frame the MP.

Like the top comment in this thread says, if they are willing to do this to a government minister, and over something so trivial, think who else they frame.

Nations can sign immigration agreements with one another that make it easier for their people to move to each other's country. One of the core goals of the EU is to integrate Europe in order to benefit the continent as a whole, simply because we are stronger (economically and militarily for example) together than as 28 separate entities. 

This is the EU's first big crisis and we are seriously considering binning the whole thing. You think over the course of 400 years the Empire didn't have crises? The only difference then was we were happy to plunder the colonies whereas now we realise that's not the way to do things.

Britain could have (several decades ago) chosen to strengthen the Commonwealth and make its Union there rather than with Europe. But Europe was the better option and as a result the idea of some British led Commonwealth Union equivalent to the EU is an unachievable fantasy. Britain couldn't make that happen and more importantly many Commonwealth members wouldn't want it to happen (they are responsible for themselves, yet certain parts of the British media like to think they're waiting for Mother Britannia to come calling).

&gt;It boggles my mind that unskilled, unemployed workers can come here because they were born in the EU, but Chinese, Indian, American etc have to go through long, complicated and very expensive procedures to work here.

There's always been someone on the receiving end of British immigration woes. It used to be the Irish, then it became Indian/Pakistani people, then Poles, now Romanians/Bulgarians.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;they can start a business, get higher tier work, take low paid work, or experience being poor like everyone else, let me counter this by asking why the working class should effectively subsidise a middle class by not enjoying the benefits of more economic efficiency.

First of all, you can't just 'start a business'. You need money (which people in this automated economy wouldn't have), workers (which wouldn't exist and would be replaced by machines), and an idea that was economically viable. You are aware that most businesses go bankrupt within the first year, aren't you?

And as for higher-tier work, I presume that would involve getting qualifications or more training....which would cost money....which people wouldn't have. So therefore most people would be screwed! And how many upper management jobs would there be, enough to subsidies for the middle class losses? Nope. As for the 'be poor like everyone else' line, you might as well be saying 'get fucked'.

&gt;so why cant people spend their time doing this kind of thing exactly?

Because you'll get bored of it. You might like to think that doing your hobbies all day every day would be amazing and wonderful and nothing but joy, but sometimes you need the drudgery of work in order to make those times of fun with hobbies more enjoyable. 

&gt;even were people to be this bored they would find more meaningful ways to spend their time than by attending pointless and menial jobs that can be automated

5 - Form Against top teams we have played all the top teams away which is a reason i don't agree with reason 2 also. So we will see what happens with that towards the end of the season when we play them at home.

4 - Over reliance of Suarez... We played pretty well without him when i think back.

3 - One thing I do agree with as I said either City or Chelsea will win the league at the start, but i do think we can finish above arsenal due to them relying on players they have scraped games missing Ozil and Ramsey and now no Theo, it should make this more interesting.

1 - Title winning experience... Blackburn? oh we have KOLO!

But my reason as to why we can't win the league is simply squad size which is also my reasoning of eliminating Arsenal (even though even their squad is bigger than ours). Playing Chelsea and having two 16 year olds on the bench tells me we aren't there yet. But i firmly believe we have a chance of finishing top 4.

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;First of all, you can't just 'start a business'. You need money (which people in this automated economy wouldn't have), workers (which wouldn't exist and would be replaced by machines), and an idea that was economically viable. You are aware that most businesses go bankrupt within the first year, aren't you?

you can get a loan to pay for machines to do the work in your business, and those businesses fail because they are a terrible business idea or badly executed, only the good ideas taken seriously succeed.

&gt;And as for higher-tier work, I presume that would involve getting qualifications or more training....which would cost money....which people wouldn't have. So therefore most people would be screwed! And how many upper management jobs would there be, enough to subsidies for the middle class losses? Nope. As for the 'be poor like everyone else' line, you might as well be saying 'get fucked'.

most people wouldn't get the higher tier work, that's not the same as screwed, government through taxes would look after their needs all that is left is what to do with their time. Yes I might as well tell the middle class who add nothing to society, take up benefits they dont need, vote against economic efficiency and generally act as selfish as possible to get fucked. good idea.

&gt;Because you'll get bored of it. You might like to think that doing your hobbies all day every day would be amazing and wonderful and nothing but joy, but sometimes you need the drudgery of work in order to make those times of fun with hobbies more enjoyable.

so you're saying the solution to boredom....is to do something even more boring? what? Hobbies are enjoyable by nature, and if you follow enough of them you will never ever ever get bored.

&gt;Such as?

hobbies, sports, art, DIY work on the home, learning interesting skills, video games, sex, gardening, volunteering for charity work, 

but no youre right theres literally nothing to do because you got bored of playing xbox and masturbating in your gap yah

Okay we've lost away at the top 3 but against the 4 teams right behind us we're unbeaten 2 wins 2 draws and 3 of those were away games. We need to take our Anfield form to places like Hull and Crystal Palace and other lower to mid table sides. I agree there is an over reliance on Suarez, but that's more to do with Gerrard being on the wain, Sturridge and Coutinho picking up silly knocks, Alberto and Aspas not yet up to the physicality of the English game, and the poor attitude of Sterling and Moses(although Raheem's attitude has improved immensely since the Hull away game and he is looking a very exciting prospect again).

Not since the Villa and Everton teams of the early 80's has a team gone from 7th to champions in consecutive seasons. And due to the speed of the game these days and the reliance more on squad football it is harder to do now. So is he right? Yes, as Liverpool won't win the league. However, I don't agree with his reasoning. Liverpool have the bones of a title winning squad. Alberto and Aspas along with Borini will be better squad options next season.

But the point is that you can't just say 'start a business'. Not every is business savvy or has great ideas, and if someone did start a business and failed there would be no recovery for that person, because it's not like he could go back to his nice middle class job and start again is it?

Wow, that was a mighty fine rant about the entire middle class there bud. I'm sure you feel better after generalising most of the population for adding nothing of value and acting selfish, despite the fact that those middle-class jobs are needed to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads.

I wonder also when that happened, exactly. Firstly, universal suffrage was introduced in Britain only in 1928, so ""the peoples of the UK"" didn't really have a vote ""centuries ago"". Secondly, looking at the history books, referendums haven't been exactly frequent in British history. Indeed, the EEC referendum of 1975 was the first nationwide referendum in Britain, and there has been only another one since (the Alternative Vote referendum of 2011).

Really, why do you consider Parliament to be sovereign in every other matter, except that of ratifying European treaties?

Firstly, you haven't joined the monetary union (yet). Secondly, the EEC never was a mere free trade area. As I said, the words ""ever closer union"" have been in the treaties since 1957.

Americans are the experts at getting money from sports events. You'll notice in recent seasons Leeds Rhino's has moved towards the American way of sports event management, that is opening the gates earlier and running lots of entertainment. The idea is you get people in early and make your money through drinks, food, programmers, etc. This has worked well for the Rhinos and has made them a lot of money.

Then consider that the 49ers are one of the giants of american football, they are some of the best in the world at making money through sporting events. With their input we should see match day profitability skyrocketing and as a result Leeds becoming a much more financially stable club, and with our history I think we can all agree on just how important this is.

I think we can expect a really overhaul in customer service and customer facilities. I'm also a steward at the club so this should be interesting and if there are any interesting changes on that end I can let you guys know.

Also you've hit the nail on the head when you say can you imagine anything like that happening under Bates. This is a sign of how far things have came from him leaving the club.

&gt;looking at the history books, referendums haven't been exactly frequent in British history. Indeed, the EEC referendum of 1975 was the first nationwide referendum in Britain, and there has been only another one since (the Alternative Vote referendum of 2011).

Just because referendums aren't common isn't an argument that they shouldn't happen.

&gt;Really, why do you consider Parliament to be sovereign in every other matter, except that of ratifying European treaties?

Because Parliament shouldn't have the power to pass the sovereignity.

&gt;Firstly, you haven't joined the monetary union (yet). Secondly, the EEC never was a mere free trade area. As I said, the words ""ever closer union"" have been in the treaties since 1957.

It's close enough to a monetary union when major economic decisions such as immigration policy are made by them not us. ""Ever closer union"" just means getting closer, that's anything lower trade barriers to bringing our cultures together. Half the point of the EU is to try and bring us closer together after two cataclysmic wars which was why those words were included. That is not enough to start deciding who we let in our country or whether we let prisoners vote.

&gt;If Britain wanted a mere free trade area, it should have stayed in the European Free Trade Association.

Because Britain is a single person with only one single viewpoint /s. Trade decisions should be made by politicians, sovereignity decisions shouldn't.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Where would the income come from? One would suppose that once automation reaches 'utopian' standards, there will be enough excess money in the public purse to guarantee everyone a decent living, job or no job. Hopefully by that time, the media would have grown up enough to let such a natural progression take place without hindrance. I am however no economist, so I don't know how exactly it would work.

Hmmm, this sounds a lot like Communism to me. Everyone gets a set amount of money from the Government no matter what they do, or don't, contribute to society. And a consequence of this would be that those 'upper management' positions talked about earlier would dissapear because, if everyone was just given a livable wage for not working, very few people would have the incentive to do those upper management jobs.

&gt;What you have is a legitimate concern of what happens when you automate absolutely everything, though is this necessarily a bad thing in comparison to the current system? Is boredom in a life of leisure a good price to pay for ending hardship and poverty?

Here is where I differentiate from what most of the people replying to me think. Others believe that this utopia would lead to a population filled with smart, skilled people who loved life and were inquisitive about learning more about the Universe. I think it would be the exact opposite, with a world filled with lazy, complacent people who could easily get away with being these things because there would be no consequences of poverty or hardship.

&gt; The reason a Linux user prefers a router to an internal modem is because the communication protocol for a router doesn't change with the manufacturer.

The OS communicates to the modem using a standard AT command set that has been the same for 30+ years. That is the same whether or not its a hardware or software modem.

&gt;  For an internal modem to work you have to install a 'driver' that the manufacturer supplies, a piece of software that is usually written for computers with a Windows OS installed, that is a 'windows box'.

Yet Linux supports them.

No, you just make constitutional law on the fly.

&gt; The power to make decisions can be passed from the people to the politicians but not from the politicians to other politicians.

Do you realise that according to that doctrine, HM Government would not have *any* power either? Where does the Cabinet get its mandate?

&gt; Just because referendums aren't common isn't an argument that they shouldn't happen.

Of course not. I was just wondering how and when exactly did ""the peoples of Britain"" mistically give ""the power to make decisions"" to Parliament? Because it certainly wasn't by referendum...

&gt; Because Parliament shouldn't have the power to pass the sovereignity.

Any international treaty constitutes a cession of sovereignity, since it sets obligations to all the parties. According to your bizarre doctrine, Parliament wouldn't have the power to ratify any international treaty whatsoever.

But it's more than that, it's all this account ever does.

Yesterday three or four threads about Mark Duggan, all in favour of the police, before that threads about speeding, police cyclists, police in court, police helicopters, and so on and so on and nothing else.

All this account ever does is comment on threads about the police, in favour of the police. Specifically it seems to be about shouting down anyone who says something negative about the police.

There is very little other activity. To be fair I haven't looked for long, but the only post I can find in your history that isn't about the police directly [is this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1uf0hq/it_is_not_the_government_who_owns_the_bank_of/cehgra9) posting lyrics to an anti-Semitic parody song about Jews ruling the world in a thread about the Bank of England. 

What do you do, all day every day come on reddit and argue against anyone that says something critical of the police force? Why do you do this?

It must be quite useful for the Police force, in a lot of ways, to have a few accounts on reddit that do nothing but say positive things about the police, and shout down people who say negative things about them. Especially since this site gets like 6million unique visitors from the UK, most of them young people, and with all these negative stories about the police in the press at the moment.

I generally do £50 a month on it, but it's my job, as well as my playtime.  The only time it limits me is when I need to download a 4Gb file, as I tend to look at it in terms of ""that's £15 actually"".  Fortuitously, my daughter and her partner live 2 mins away so I pop round there to download HUGE FILES.  They love me for it 〠‿〠

There is a mildly interesting new development in my service provider shenanigans (and, no, I'm not splashing details around as I don't want to kill the golden calf or whatever they call it).

This is supposedly forbidden on PAYG.  So, the other day I downloaded a 3Gb file on my lappie through my phone in around 45 mins. If anything, tethering it is faster than the dongle speed.  

However I'm not rude or mean and I still buy my £25 broadband vouchers. I just spank it a bit more. It's just that if I run out at the weekend and can't be arsed to go out I can just tether it.  Or, if I want a 4Gb file from Microsoft.  I look on these occasions as ""a treat"".  They still get plenty of my dosh.

Can't recommend places to eat beyond saying there's lots of nice places down the Mumbles - I don't tend to eat out in Swansea very often.

In Cardiff there's lots as well - the bay is really nice with plenty of places to eat/drink and you can walk/cycle across to Penarth via the barrage - lots of small shops and places to eat there. The Castle in the centre is good, but there's also Castle Coch (near Tongwnlais) to the north - you can cycle there via the Taff Trail in about 45 minutes, or drive in about 15. St Fagans is a bit of a drive away but worth a visit too. Could check out what's on (Comedy/Films, etc) at Chapter Arts Centre too.

Nice places to eat: I'd recommend a looking in Canton and Pontcanna, there's a place called Patagonia which I've heard good things about. There's also a farmers market in Riverside (over the river from the Stadium) on a Sunday which can be a good place for breakfast/lunch. If you're willing to go a bit out of the centre, there's also a few places along Wellfield Road (in Roath), including a nice Italian place (forgotten the name.. maybe Dolce Vita?) and a Tapas bar called Juno Lounge. If you like Curry, there's also loads of places along City Road.

&gt;Imgur was added to the IWF blacklist weeks ago, there was a thread about it in r/uk because people from numerous ISPs were experiencing very slow connections to imgur.

&gt;To briefly explain how the cleanfeed/IWF system works, it's designed to block individual files rather than whole sites. When you make a request, your ISP first checks to see if that IP address is listed in the blacklist. If not, the request is processed normally. If it is, the request is routed through a special proxy server. The proxy server will allow you to view the site except for specifically listed files.

&gt;What has presumably happened here is that the proxy server that VM use has fallen over. It'll probably be resolved soon, but imgur will likely remain on the blacklist for whatever reason, which means slow connections and unreliable proxy servers will remain a problem for everyone trying to access imgur from the UK for the foreseeable future

&gt;Edit: Wikipedia has an overview of how the system works

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"The timing of this referendum is ridiculous. The EU has been used as scape goat for the financial crisis when the truth is it doesn't appear to have any real attributable role in it. Banks would have still been run to maximise short term profits, American investment firms would still have bought British Banks and run them in to the ground. Iceland would have still been as corrupt as Met.

You have the ""immigration"" problem that everybody has been banging on about for the last decade. Yet there's still no real evidence that it is a problem or that EU law has caused any real change from our border policy since WW2. Meanwhile, Germany the most financially stable country in the EU has been subject to the same legislation, had just as much immigration, the same financial crisis.

So what's the real difference? Well, for one I think it's pretty obvious that mainland Europe has spent a significant amount of it's time going with the flow when it comes to changes in global economics. Unlike the UK, instead of wasting their time trying to come up with hair-brain schemes to undermine the legislation that 20+ other countries find acceptable, they have embraced it and come out better as a result. They have respected politicians in the European parliament, meanwhile we have been herded in to such contempt for it that Nick Griffin can actually get voted in.

While we're showing the EU contempt they're constantly covering our peoples backs. Helping enforce better human rights, from improving literal basic human rights (right to fair trial instead of being shipped off to Guantanamo) or such as implementing law to marginalise the ability for the state to monitor its people. The EU's franchised legislation on industrial standards mean that anything manufactured or produced in the EU is fit from British consumption, and vice versa. We are free to move around the EU, and our international trade in the Eurozone is considerably cheaper.

We're really a spoilt brat child of a country that is sat in the corner having a tantrum. Blaming everything on Europe instead of having enough introspection to question what our government are actually doing.

true,Kyoraki,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt; Hmmm, this sounds a lot like Communism to me. Everyone gets a set amount of money from the Government no matter what they do, or don't, contribute to society. And a consequence of this would be that those 'upper management' positions talked about earlier would dissapear because, if everyone was just given a livable wage for not working, very few people would have the incentive to do those upper management jobs.

Not quite. I was thinking socialism, but on a far larger scale we have currently. Upper management, and even middle management jobs would continue to exist, at a rate that is higher than the guaranteed income. A guaranteed income would allow you to live comfortably. A higher paying job will allow you to live in luxury, and lord knows there will be no shortage of people for that.

&gt;Here is where I differentiate from what most of the people replying to me think. Others believe that this utopia would lead to a population filled with smart, skilled people who loved life and were inquisitive about learning more about the Universe. I think it would be the exact opposite, with a world filled with lazy, complacent people who could easily get away with being these things because there would be no consequences of poverty or hardship. 

That would depend entirely on your opinion on human nature, and how willing we would be to adapt. Our current leisure activities are based around relaxing on our 'off' time from work, and would no doubt change dramatically. The world would be filled with vastly more intelligent, athletic, and skilled people because of the massive void of activity that killing all working class jobs would create. Holidays abroad would be less about tanning by the beach and more about exploring local cultures, etc. Do you get what I mean here?

If one person doesn't want to take the unskilled job paying £7 an hour, there will be several hundred others who will gladly fill the position. Equally, if a company is offering a multi-million pound salary to a top executive role, it's because they are seeking someone with the required talent to justify it. If it no longer becomes viable to offer these sorts of wages at either end of the spectrum, the market will adjust accordingly.

The issue of not being able to earn a ""livable"" wage only applies to those at the very bottom of the pay-scale doing unskilled work that anyone with a pulse could do.

Why not raise the minimum wage then? Well yeah sure but then you also raise the barrier to entry for low-paid positions, making it even more difficult for the unemployed to actually find work, not to mention making it increasingly difficult for businesses to hire new people, since workers must now bring more value to the table to make new hires viable.

OK, so why not tax the fuck out of the top earners? And do what with that money, exactly? Increase unemployment benefits and promote unemployment? How about lowering taxes for the lower income sectors? Low-income workers make up a huge portion of the workforce, so the offset would be negligible at best.

The issue is complex for sure, and there is no easy or universally right answer.

One thing for sure though is that sitting around proclaiming that anyone earning a higher wage than you is somehow undeserving of it and your part-time job serving coffee at Starbucks is equally valuable to the economy as heading up a billion pound company just smacks of ignorance and bitterness.",0,1389380349,null,0,false,0,cembj58,t3_1uw0qv,t1_cembj58,t1_cemajrr,null,1431885749,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It would take some pretty drastic measures. I mean some *real* big ones. 'Immediately cutting ties with the Tories and possibly also maybe replacing Clegg' sort of big. Them just releasing a video about how they're 'sorry' or how they've changed isn't going to cut it.

In the last election the Lib Dems proved to me (and to my entire generation, you could argue) that they're not to be trusted. They were a bunch of people who had promises and appearances that seemed to set them apart from the rest, but when they entered a coalition with the Tories (The Tories! The party on the opposite end of the bloody spectrum!) they immediately rolled over and let them do what they wanted, just like that.

The tuition fees thing may just be one rotten apple in this metaphorical fruit bowl, but it sums them up perfectly well. They promised that tuition fee rises wouldn't happen, it's what made them so popular and got them the support of the young generation, and before the nameplates at No. 10 had even changed the fees tripled, with anyone upset about it kettled and demonised.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;In the last election the Lib Dems proved to me (and to my entire generation, you could argue) that they're not to be trusted.

They proved that they're human and drastically overestimated the influence they'd have in a Coalition government. 

&gt;were a bunch of people who had promises and appearances that seemed to set them apart from the rest, but when they entered a coalition with the Tories (The Tories! The party on the opposite end of the bloody spectrum!) they immediately rolled over and let them do what they wanted, just like that.

And it's ill-informed opinions like this that make me dispair for the political future of this country. 

For starters, the Tories and Lib Dems aren't on the other end of the spectrum at all, one's centre left, the other centre right. 

Secondly, they didn't ""roll over"" as you put it, they got forced into a position where they had very little choice in what was going on. They had to make concessions or get nothing. The Tories knew this and played it to politically attack the Lib Dems by causing a rift of trust between Voters and them. 

&gt;They promised that tuition fee rises wouldn't happen, it's what made them so popular and got them the support of the young generation, and before the nameplates at No. 10 had even changed the fees tripled, with anyone upset about it kettled and demonised.

This is probably the most short sighted part of your post.

I'll give an analogy, today at work I promised someone I would get an issue sorted for them (I work in IT Support) and everything was going according to plan until a colleague refused to help. I couldn't do the task as it's outside of my remit. 

Now, I apologised to the customer and explained the situation, she was annoyed - but not at me. That's the key point, it would be futile to be annoyed at me as I can't control that bit. 

The same applies to the coalition. The Lib Dems are a very, very small minority here. They don't actually hold much influence on the Tories simply because they're only required to keep a stable government. 

When you get in to areas such as Tuition fee's, the lib dems hold that little voting power on the matter that the Tories would never let them control it. It's not like if the Lib Dems said no it wouldn't have gone through.

Further to that, had they said no, what do you think the political scene would look like now? Do you honestly think the good Lib Dems have done, and the concessions the Tories made to them, would have happened had they refused to go ahead with the rise in tuition fees?

Ultimately your problem is the same as everyone elses, you focus so much on the big media grabbing issues, and completely ignore the smaller unreported matters. 

Actually look up what the Lib Dems have done for us since the coalition started. We owe them a fucking lot. Had they refused to raise tuition fees a lot of other shit would be much worse than it is now.

I actually didn't know much about the 49ers (I'd heard the name before, but never thought anything further than ""That's a weird team name""), let alone that they're considered giants in the sport, so now I know that the deal holds more significance than Leeds randomly selecting an NFL team to discuss business strategy with.

One potential 49ers-inspired change that crossed my mind could be a stadium sponsor for Elland Road (*shudder*), which is something we've all been at least half-expecting for a while now - I genuinely expect to see one by 2015 - and the 49ers would probably be able to give advice regarding a ballpark figure Leeds should look for, considering that their brand new stadium is named after a clothing chain store.

Or if you fancy going veggie, there's [Bistro 1847](http://bistro1847.com/‎) the new vegetarian restaurant in Great Western Arcade.

Or Broad St. / Edgbaston Way there's:

* [The Pickled Piglet](http://www.thepickledpiglet.co.uk/) just off Broad Street

* [Opus Restaurant at Cafe Ikon](http://www.opusrestaurant.co.uk/) Really nice and the gallery is worth a look too, in Brindleyplace

* Or [Canalside Cafe](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186402-d2572326-Reviews-Canalside_Cafe-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html) midway between Broad street and the Mailbox is a great place (as long as the weather is nice...)

Or there's always the chain (Lloyds Bar / Wetherspoons / Wagamama  / Pizza Express / etc.) if none of these take your fancy.

Enjoy your visit to brum and if you have chance, take time to visit the new Library, it's a great place to wander around for an hour and the views from the top are great.

As you said better use of club-owned space is another that they will definitely be interested in. As for cheer leading I would say that will be one definitely. They are now doing it at the Leeds Rhinos matches and it works, people like it.

The thing is leeds did not select a team to have a partnership with. What they did was strike an incredible deal, how they got it is beyond me. It seems likely that one of the members of consortium must have some contacts. As we know a certain billionaire who has been linked with haigh has a huge amount of contacts in the USA, Hollywood actors etc. Could this be hinting that he may actually be part of the consortium?

Also you mention pricing. I know immediately people will be thinking oh shit shirt prices will be through the roof. I don't believe they will raise the prices of shirts and I have logic to back that up. Leeds has been working very hard on its PR. Fans are used to hating those at the top and High and co have clearly been trying to go the opposite way, they want the fans to like them. They know that with what we've experienced from Bates we value having a chairman/executives that we can agree with more than most fans. Knowing Bates loved having ridiculously high prices, it wouldn't be in line with their PR to make a Batesesque move such as raising shirt prices.

 Basically, if your house has a TV, your house pays for a TV license (the licence is per household, not per TV). That money goes to BBC, some goes to Channel 4 and weirdly, Sky get a cut, too, but the lion's share goes to the BBC. Cable/satellite is then in addition to the TV licence, if you want it. The way they're structured is they have all the free to air channels, plus the paid for channels. On those platforms the BBC is still the most prominent and popular broadcaster. It's got to account for 75% of the TV and radio my own household consumes. 

As for consumption over the net, the BBC again takes a large chunk of that, too with the iPlayer free to all UKIPs. Other providers are entering the market, but they're not a threat to the Beeb or it's income. The only threats to the Beeb come from the government, cutting the licence fee and from that nice Mr Murdoch demanding an end to the licence fee (even though that provided the seed money for his own empire).

Yes and no.  It is illegal to watch live tv without a licence, but it's rarely forcibly enforced.  If you don't have a licence, you get letters every few months to tell you to either pay up or declare you don't watch live tv.  If you fill in the declaration, it stops the letters for a year, when you have to fill in the new declaration.

Even if you have the *capability* to watch live tv, but don't, you don't have to pay the licence.  So, for example, if you rented a house that had an aerial, and had a tv for playing xbox, but didn't connect the two, you wouldn't need a licence.  If you didn't have a tv or aerial at all, but streamed live tv from the BBC's website, you'd need a licence.

It doesn't really make sense to Americans, because it's not a system you've ever had.  An honour system like that wouldn't really work if you introduced it now, but it works here because we've had it for nearly seventy years, it's just something we're all used to.

&gt;But there is still terrible prejudice within football. People pick on weaknesses. You have to deal with being constantly derided for the most trivial matters: your trainers, your haircut, your picture in the newspaper. It is endless and can be draining. If you can make someone else look stupid, that is the ideal.

I think there was also a lot of class or collectivist antagonism in the treatment of Le Saux, iirc it was because of his tastes and he way he spoke etc; other footballers who have tastes in art and such like David James haven't been subject to such treatment (that I know of). I wonder what would be the reaction if some comparable hard man like lee cattermole came out as gay or something. I'm not sure how much things have changed but I think that David Beckham becoming a big hero seems to have altered the kind of attitudes to some of the stuff Le Saux was bullied for, at least superficially. It really sounds like something that would happen at school.

It really is down to the greed of the rich.

true,LedgeySC,cnty-uk,Manchester,"I know you are, I implied that typically it would be against your interests for students to pay higher. 

But anyway, I agree that at present student debts are the best debts you can get, even with the rise. But lumping tens of thousands of pounds on teenagers just coming out of college is always going to be off-putting, even if you dress the repayments up.

Of course it puts people off, to claim it hasn't stopped anyone is simply wrong. The question is by what degree has it put people off? [Mature students](http://money.uk.msn.com/news/fee-rises-put-off-mature-students-1) are apparently put off. [Early applicants](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/almost-15000-students-put-off-university-by-tuition-fee-rise-8026187.html) who sought to go before it was introduced were put off. [Parts of the working class](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/higher-university-tuition-fees-putting-off-workingclass-boys-8566602.html) were put off. Perhaps it hasn't changed the overall figure of applicants, but it has prevented accessibility to specific groups of people.

Privatising student loans is certainly possible and [recent government actions](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/its-happening-george-osborne-admits-tories-will-privatise-student-loans-8986505.html) have confirmed that it is. Many people have said that privatising the royal mail, introducing fees and even raising them wouldn't happen but that all happened. Obviously selling off the books on old loans prove that the government is perhaps unwilling to invest in the long term in students. Even if the old structure is in place with the already privatised loans all it does is increase pressure from private companies to make them even more profitable.

Don't get me wrong, I know what you're saying. It is largely inconsequential in its present state. The problem is however the bad precedence it sets for future higher education legislation and it doesn't fill me with confidence when the Lib Dems would tear up an agreement with thousands and thousands of students for power.

This extends to quality brands too - typically the TVs in supermarkets that are made by ""Sharp"" or ""LG"" or ""JVC"" or even ""Toshiba"" don't have a single component from any of those companies, it's made by a third party (normally a Turkish company called Vestel) and branded by someone else having paid for the right to use the brand from one of the Japanese companies.

true,albacore_futures,null,null,"Took me a while to figure out what the fuck this means. Each dot represents an individual player and the number of minutes he's played. It's a graph which measures how much work each player has put in on the pitch.

So when you look at Arsenal, the steep dropoff from ~15-24 indicates that they basically play 11 players with 4 subs, and everyone else sits on the bench. This should lead to the conclusion that they probably won't be able to keep this up - their players should be getting exhausted, because they are not deep enough to share the workload.

You look at Chelsea, and you see that there's 4 players which play almost every minute of every game, then about 10-15 which play very similar minutes, and another 5 which don't play much at all. This indicates they have pretty good depth, but are dependent on 4-5 key players.

Man City has 2-3 players which play almost every minute, then (similar to Chelsea) have 15 ish which play similar minutes in the middle. They, too, appear to have good depth - particularly if you look at their players 12 through 19, all of which get more minutes than players 12-19 on any of the other three teams.

Spurs seem to have 2 elite players (I'd guess they are Dawson and Lloris) who play almost every minute, and then a much slower slope down to player 27. That means more players are getting a shot at Spurs than are getting shots at most of the other clubs (City being the exception, if one ignores the teensy contributions from 22 through 27).",0,1389390738,null,0,1389390958,0,cemgjt5,t3_1uwkvr,t1_cemgjt5,t3_1uwkvr,null,1431888199,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

It remains to be seen if it will be difficult for clubs like City and PSG, depending on whether or not the regulations have teeth. If they do, then PSG is definitely in trouble. Even their sponsorship won't help them, as it's from a party too closely related to the owners (which is against the regs). City I'm not so sure about, it'll be closer. But if either of those clubs were punished seriously like having a European football ban, they would loose a lot of top talent and fail to bring in new players. 

As for who's the ""better"" club, I'm not quite sure what point you're trying to make. In terms of recent success, neither of those guys are even close. In terms of talent, I'd say we're about equal to City and ahead of PSG (I figure Cech, Terry, Ramires, Hazard, Oscar, and probably Willian would make it into the City XI on current form...I'd take Silva, Ibra/Cavani from PSG but that's it). 

But I don't know what any of that has to do with Chelsea wanting to look ""weak"". I'm pretty sure most (if not all) of the relevant parties are amenable to a new stadium, given the right proposal. Roman doesn't need to use FFP as an excuse. I'm also certain that's not his strategy either, since he's been trying to build a new stadium since he came to the club--well before FFP existed.

1. He knows he's garbage compared to a traditional striker yet he still continues to try to prove people wrong (Note I said try because we all know it's on and off for him). His confidence is improving more and more recently. Check out his 2011-2012 season vs his 2012-2013 season. Check out how he's playing so far 2013-2014 he's improving there's no doubt about it.

2. Injuries, injuries, injuries (See his injuries list below). Since 2007 to now he's been suffering knee problems, has torn an abductor muscle, had a pulmonic cyst, has been pulling hamstrings, etc. Compare his injuries list to Lukaku, Falcao, Lionel Messi, etc. He suffered a LOT of injuries and yet he's still playing. He hasn't quit. Take a look at the WC2010 when he pulled his hamstring: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rhDpELsSg

3. His strive for consistency and his determination to score goals. He's still trying, despite the constant hate from people around the world. It's over all over social media, it's a joke, it's a trend to make fun of his mistakes. Watch him against Manchester City, the crowd was chanting his name the crowd was going wild at everything he's done at that game. The crowd was hungry for goals from him and alas, he produced and assist and a goal securing their victory. He only needs to be consistent now but remember he recently came back from an injury so it'll take time for him to play like that again. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb3FrUS4KRo

I totally understand your hatred for him (If you do hate him) since he took 3 freaking years and still not making the progress we've wanted from him (albeit he's made some pretty sick goals and exciting runs). Chelsea wants results but keep in mind the BPL is the most competitive. If we were to win the BPL title today, it'll be because of our squad and hopefully Torres.

I want to ask you something. Let's say you have a girlfriend. You also have two beautiful kids that you want to watch them grow up. You have two dogs, and live a very private but public life. I'm describing Torres now if you didn't know it. Imagine all these injuries that are tearing him apart. If he can no longer walk or run anymore what would be the impact on both his private and work life? Don't you think he's afraid of not being able to become a father to look up to? What I'm getting at is, he's a person too you know. He's still trying very hard to please us all despite his injury list. Who knows when an injury sustained would be permanent.

So to conclude, despite all the trash talk, injuries, etc he still wants to play for us. He wants to go through his five-year contract with us. He wants to please us. He's working hard for us.

I hope you understand now, cheers!

Everything about that season was catastrophic for us and every single time we thought we could find our way and cope with the losses, we were shot down again and we still rose up back to the bottom and back to the top and we rose as champions and we fought and we fought, we bled, we fought like hell. It's not a miracle and it wasn't written in the stars, it was in our mentality and in our players courage that we were meant to win the Champions league. Everything about that season was bitter sweet. Torres, my idol, having so little playtime, confidence gone, every time he was on the pitch people boo'd at him and even a monkey could see how it affected our team and everything revolving us. Our own number 9 was being BOO'd. Shame on us, shame on him and shame on the game. We stood so low that we were rejecting one of our own, Fernando is blue and people were shooting him down and not boosting his morale. Yet he scored against BARCELONA when we were down a player and not just any player, we were down Johny fucking Terry, incredible. I remember SCREAMING at my TV as Rami was passed a brilliant ball from Lampard and he chips it beautifully over valdes to the goal and then in the dying minutes of the game Cole finds Fernando with a hasty clearance and Fernando dribbles past valdes and nets us through for sure, no chance for barca anymore. EVERYONE GOES CRAZY. I dropped my drink on the floor and jumped up and down my flat. After that I hanged my Torres shirt on my window with a coat hanger for at least a week, I was so proud. Everything about that season was bitter sweet. I still can't believe we let Didier go, I do not understand why. It breaks my heart. Everything about this documentary makes my heart ache. I love that they put my favorite song by Sigur rós on it (you can hear it at somewhere around 6:55). I love how Petr is smiling constantly through out the entire video even when he is describing our difficulties and our struggles against napoli etc. I love how Didier cannot control himself and is exploding from within as he runs up and down the pitch as a champions league winner. Everything about this documentary pivots our triumph and our win against the greatest team in the world. I remember watching every single game in excitement. I remember burrowing my face in my fathers shoulder as Didier stepped up as the last penalty kicker. I remember screaming my lungs out and yelling in awe and in respect for our team. Everything about our win against Bayern brings me to my knees as I realize how much it means to me. Everything about it. Even the fact that my ex girlfriend lives in München and that my team won them, makes me happier than you could imagine, it truly is a great gift for me. Every time i view this documentary, my heart screams, because we got what we deserved after all these years we won the Champions League. I am happy to be blue.

FFP is about the lower end clubs. Just look at Malaga. They had been unable to pay wages and thus, they have been sanctioned. Once Chelsea starts unable to pay wages regularly, then you should be worried. 

As far as City/PSG goes, the point was that they are not going to struggle with FFP or worried about it as you are pointing out. Their success and the ability to purchase players says so.

Chelsea and Roman can not just buy any land in London and say, I'm going to build a stadium here.

Not really. Over here, the BBC has the nickname 'Auntie', and it's for a good reason. The BBC exists in pretty much everybody's daily lives in some way or another, and because we're so small it means it can dominate a lot of things. Bear in mind it's also politically independent (though people argue constantly about which way it really leans), so the reporting on there is consistently balanced and everyone in the spectrum will watch it. 

The BBC also covers sport (eg all of the Olympic coverage), creates new drama productions, has multiple news reports through the day, and produces it's own reality shows. It covers comedy, charity fundraisers like Comic Relief and Children In Need, concerts, breaking and world news, documentaries, soaps, entertainment programming like Top Gear...pretty much anything you might possibly watch on TV, the BBC does. It also has several radio stations, which will run adverts for upcoming BBC programmes. The BBC also has its own online service called iPlayer, so it redirects anyone consuming offline onto its own channels. 

Basically, the BBC is huge and covers everything anyone might watch. There are also two main broadcast channels (BBC One and BBC Two) as well as the ad-funded players, (ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5), and puts newer content on its two other channels, BBC Three and BBC Four which you'll get through subscription services like Sky or a Freeview box. It has absolutely *everything* covered, so I'd think it's actually far more unlikely for someone to NOT consume live TV than to be moving away from it altogether.

Lol, whatevs. As the yoot say. 

The CPS literally look at the facts as presented to them. That's it. If there isn't a reasonable prospect of conviction (and that bar is set pretty high), they'll bin a case like a shot. They are not shy of telling the police to piss off and do some more work if they think the file is light, or they'll just boot it into the long grass. 

It's not a case of the CPS believing a copper over a minister, it's a case of the CPS saying ""It could go either way, sorry. We're not taking it to trial because we'd never get a prosecution out of it.""

Don't mistake the CPS for an independent arbitrator as that's not their job. They (occasionally, it sometimes seems) prosecute criminals. It's what they do. If they thought the could do either party for any offence, they'd be all over it like a cheap suit.

I'm not done yet. The women who fit bras in shops are like car salesmen, they're all lying cunts! (yes, I said the c word in full, I feel that strongly about the matter). When I was 16 some twat in the Army &amp; Navy in Victoria tried to convince me that I was a 32F. F. F. F. I've always had a wide back so I've always been a 36+ and when I was 16 I barely had fried eggs to carry. But noooo, she wanted to reign my rib cage in and sell me a bra that would not only crush my spine but make me look like an 80 year old. Seriously, the fucking cups on this thing were like small planets, and the bra straps were so thick that they looked like an extra item of clothing. Needless to say I didn't take her advice.

My experience last year was not dissimilar. The twat in M&amp;S tried to convince me that I am a size which is readily available on their shelves in order to get me to buy stuff, but my own measurements told me that she's bullshitting. Three badly sized bras later, I was right, she was wrong. For the benefit of the doubt I gave her £120, and they all look/feel like shit.*

I agree that he signed a credit contract and so there was a third party left out of the loop in this exchange. However as someone who has been in these agreements in the past, this is rarely made clear at point of sale. For that I also blame the retailer.

As far as Dixons group within my experience have claimed, the deal is with them alone. Only the small print reveals a third party.

Small print is print nonetheless, however when told to ""sign here"" one is never invited to read the terms, let alone the future terms imposed by the line ""We may make amendments to this contract without notice, warning, or agreement and you have to find them for yourself""

""Buy now pay later"" should actually read ""Buy now pay now, we're now loan brokers despite no FSA/FCA regulation and we do only offer loans with one company (the one who pay us the most commission) so if we cancel our agreement, you'll need to work out how to pay them back regardless!""

Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith have been running from the legacy of the Time War, and with the Day of the Doctor and the revelation of the Time Lords' survival the Doctor can really start over. So something I'd like to see from Capaldi is a sort of spirit of exploration, doing things that he's never done before and going to brand new places.

I'd also like to see Madame Vastra, Jenny and Strax join the Doctor in the TARDIS, at least for a little while; I adore all three of them and I'd love to see them taken out of their element some more. As for River, I wish that the Doctor would find a way to get her out of the Library, both because I'd like to see her go forward in her timeline rather than just exploring her past, and also because I think the onscreen chemistry between her and Capaldi would be out of this world, pun very much intended.

Moving on, I'd like to see more female characters on screen in the vein of Tasha, but perhaps with the whole psycho element toned down. Tasha represented something I thought was really cool--in addition to being a physical and intellectual badass, she was the head of this vast organization and was responsible for all sorts of really cool (and also profoundly disturbing) stuff. I think it was weird, though, that both she and River were described as psychopaths. In any case, one possibility would be that one or two Time Lords escape from the pocket dimension containing Gallifrey and either try to help or try to take down the Doctor. A female Time Lord (or, at least, a Time Lord in a female persona), who has aspects reminiscent of Romana (or is Romana--I wouldn't object), would definitely be pretty welcome, and has the potential to transform the series as greatly as River. Plus, we could have a companion who was a fellow Time Lord.

Fourthly, my prediction is that we're going to see a lot more elements from the old series during Capaldi's tenure as the Doctor. When the series was first restarted by Davies, one of the conditions for the BBC picking it up was that elements of the old series be culled so as to allow for an audience that maybe hadn't watched the old series before. But with such a broad and loyal audience now, both of only new series viewers and both-series viewers, they can afford to dig more openly into the vast wealth of old series materials. Obviously, to a certain extent they already have, even having their first cameo from an old series Doctor in the 50th, but now they can bring back more old series villains, reintroduce old series characters (beyond the allusion to the Brigadier's death), and maybe even, seeing as they have a semi-respectable budget now, really and properly show us what Gallifrey's like.",0,1389398004,null,0,false,0,cemjr6p,t3_1uw6jb,t1_cemjr6p,t3_1uw6jb,null,1431889706,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

1st wave feminism - Focused on gaining legal equality and removing legal obstacles (so the right to vote, access to the workforce, property rights, etc...)

2nd wave feminism - Born in the 60s counter culture and focused on gaining social equality and gaining legal protections (so smashing the glass ceiling, securing re-productive rights, breaking up the ""boys clubs"", etc...)  was notorious for almost solely focusing on the plight of middle class white women in western nations. Didn't trust lesbians and was outright hostile to transsexuals.

Feminist sex war - Basically an academic civil war between two sides that self described as ""anti-pornography feminists"" and ""sex positive feminists"" I think you can guess the views each side held.

3rd wave feminism - Born in the 90s at the end of the sex war (with sex positive ideology largely the victor) with a focus on cultural equality (aka breaking stereotypes) and sought to focus on the people that the 2nd wave ignored (namely solidarity and support for homosexuals and transsexuals, women outside the western world, and poor and ethnic minority women in the west).

He's actually right about Winmodems (aka softmodems). Everything else is nonsense though.

Often these were cheap pieces of crap plugged into an AMR slot. Rather than providing a hardware modulator/demodulator, all of the signal processing was done in software, by the driver. As a result, Linux support for Winmodems was basically non-existant, and a Linux user would therefore use a modem/router instead.

&gt;but even the MET have said ""the officers concluded that the integrity of Met colleagues was ""no longer intact"".""

That's an unfair cherry picking of the report. What the full quote says is:

""...but **if** an officer has written those words in his pocket notebook or in a report **and** they are false then that is actually a very serious misconduct issue... **their** integrity is no longer intact.""

(emphasis mine). 

It is worth mentioning, for the moment, that the CPS have stated that there is no evidence to suggest that the PC at the gate has lied. If he has made up a words that weren't actually said, then it is true, his integrity would no longer be intact.

I also think that it's worth noting that this took place at the height of the discontent about the Winsor reforms and, unlike the rest of the population, police officers have no recourse to industrial action. The Met Federation is basically powerless when it comes to the big picture, but very good at dealing with local issues. The very definition of a big fish in a small pond. They've seen 'dirty' politics on the TV, and they think they can have a go at it because, after all, he only said ""pleb"". Whoever leaked the police report (jesus, so soon after Op Weeting? What a pillock!) clearly thought they could make a bit of mischief and a small number of activist coppers thought they could make some capital from it, not even contemplating what it feels like to have the media machine of the government of the day bearing down on them. They had literally no contemplation of how toxic the tories would consider that word to be.

The thing is, had Mitchell been alleged to have committed a 'proper' crime, this would never have happened. It would have been by the book, with stern statements from Cameron and the Commissioner, full investigation, measured and sensible releases of information as the investigation progressed. 

That isn't to say that I think they should be excused, far from it - these officers will lose their jobs and rightly so. They've made it just that bit harder for their colleagues to do their work, because Billy the Burglar now knows he can make an accusation in court about an officer's integrity and it's quite possible that the jury will believe him.

But I think it is a mistake to suggest that there was some sort of cabal of coppers out to stitch up a minister any way they could. It's my view that it's a militant tendency, in single figures (out of 32,000 other coppers in the met), who bit off far more than they could possibly chew and they are paying the price with their reputation and careers.

I spent an unusual 6 months working as a temp in 10 Downing Street (answering Gordon Brown's mail, as it happens), and it's true to say that there were always people of some description milling about outside the Downing St gate. That's not a controversial statement to make.

I don't take 'several' to mean many more than ten, but your take may differ. I also note that the CPS (who were almost certainly looking for any excuse to prosecute) subsequently stated that:

""We have considered all of the evidence in this case, including previously unseen, unedited CCTV footage from Downing Street, not referred to by the media. Taking it all into account, including the accounts of the officer at the gate of Downing Street and that of Andrew Mitchell MP before, during and after the incident, we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account. ""

I further note that the CPS [stated](http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/cps_decisions_in_operation_alice/) that ""No officer ever mentioned ""crowds"" being present - this was first mentioned in Channel 4 News/Dispatches programmes in December 2012 and February 2013 - which showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards"".

&gt;But remember, one of those imaginary tourists was the Asian man out with his nephew from Hong-Kong who saw the whole affair and backed up the police reports... who turned out to be this PC Keith Wallis who has admitted misconduct today.

And he's a fucking idiot for doing what he did. But I don't see how that casts doubt on the original note that the PC on the gate made, given it was done sometime after the fact, unless you're alleging that he colluded with others to gear up a conspiracy in the short time between the incident and the time he made his contemporaneous note.

Then I'd have to argue that despite Lamela's awesome Assist registry at Roma last season, his pace, dribbling style and ability to poach would be lost in the play maker slot if we give him the Eriksen role. 

Lastly, playing Lamela in a 4-4-2 formation was tried at Roma (in a considerably less competitive and slower league) with no results. He doesn't really thrive in this flat formation, especially since it relies on his defensive contribution (which if you look at his stats this season, are appalling to say the least). His real strength lies when played in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1. This gives him the comfort of a midfield pivot so that him and the other winger don't have to contribute defensively (or not as much as in a 4-4-2). This would also allows our men Eriksen and Holtby to play the #10 role which they excel at.

I personally like Townsend, Lamela, Lennon, Chadli, and Siggurdson (when he's on the wing) all competing for a place on the wings. It's an even number (we all know Siggurdson will go back to midfield once we got our playmaker and striker connecting properly) and gives us depth to make us challenges on all competitions.",0,1389402655,null,0,false,0,cemll8i,t3_1usxr0,t1_cemll8i,t3_1usxr0,null,1431890684,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

What happens when a crooked officer takes a copy of someone's data and sells it?  No, not mine.  I know no one has much interest in me.  How about when someone calls up a potential Prime Minister a few months before a General Election and suggests that if he doesn't resign his download history will be made public and that maybe the British public won't vote for a guy who downloads transsexual BDSM porn?

The potential for blackmail and corruption with that sort of data in the wrong hands is terrifying.

At the highest competitive level in the recent age of soccer (last 30 years) the BEST teams are generally matched in strength for most positions, but because great full backs are a rarity in soccer, teams can find an edge here.

He is willing to press the ball highly, I just don't think it shines through all of the time because it is not necessarily in the nature of Hazard or Oscar to assist this, pressing high up the pitch, requires a total team effort, starting with our attacking quartet. That may rub some people the wrong way, because Oscar does have a good work-rate off the ball, but in no way do I think that are AM follow Torres' lead (off the ball) when it comes to pressing.

Torres is also willing to follow the ball back across the wrong side of the half-way line and does a fair job defending corners. 

Does he sulk occasionally? No question. But he does work hard, and I think that would shine through more if our midfielders were more intent on passing forward earlier and being a bit more direct i.e. Lampard and Luiz. I also believe this is the main cause of him being pushed wider on his runs. If he were to receive the ball earlier, the ball would come to his feet more centrally. 

I don't question his work rate and I'm not criticizing our style of play with the strikers that we do have. Without a doubt, the midfield is the strength of the team, but this style doesn't fit Torres.
