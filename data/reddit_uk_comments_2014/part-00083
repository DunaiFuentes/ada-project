So from a psychology factor it could go either way. 

Assuming Adebayor is still hurt they won't have a credible threat up top (unless they win a bunch of penalties, in which case Soldado will do just fine), but Eriksen could be a problem.

I think it's important to not get *too* cocky going into the game. We were cocky before Villa, and they left Anfield with a point. We were a little cocky before Swansea, and they gave us a game. Spurs could be tricky. We can't fall asleep on them.

Young adults are do different than immigrants. Neither of them have contributed to the system. There is no valid reason to give young adults benefits while refusing to give immigrants benefits. Not being born in England is simply not a valid reason. Hopefully you will understand that if you think about the above questions.

Edit 5: Aguero and Tevez used to want the same jersey locker space. Perhaps an answer for why Tevez finally moved to Juventus?

Edit 6: I won't ruin it all for you, but I can say I enjoyed it throughly. Loved seeing the ins and outs of City and interviews with people who have heard of but never had the pleasure of seeing. It shows how much every single person truly loves being involved in the daily happenings of MCFC. Highly recommended and will be watching the specials they do for all of the teams.

true,Mirrorface,null,null,"Everything you've described was literally my life for 3 years after graduating from university! I originally came from a legal background and I got to the point where I would have taken any job, regardless of description or pay. Luckily, after months of soul crushing demoralisation, I caught a lucky break and started working in my new job in less than a week.

Here are a few pointers that I've picked up along the way that you may or may not find useful:

- Post your CV on all the online job websites (Reed, Monster, Metro, Jobsite etc) but keep updating it weekly or at least fortnightly, even if you haven't changed it. I was recruited by an agency finding my CV on Reed a whole month after I had posted it up, so hopefully you'll be in with a chance this way too!

- Do you know what your dream job/industry is? If so, work towards it no matter what. It's always a good thing to have a goal, and even though it may take a long way to the top, you will always have some thing to aim for which I feel is better than shooting out random job applications. I have also found that my passion shows through a lot more in my applications for my desired job sector and I actually find it easier to write why I'm good for that role etc.

- Annoying as it is, and also mentioned above; tailor your CV and applications to the job. Mirror the exact skills and requirements that are being asked.

- Piece of advice a good friend of mine told me: write my cover letters/applications eloquently. I had to the read up the definition of this word to find out exactly what it meant and now apply it everywhere I can. Put yourself in the shoes of the person reading if possible and if your letter sounds boring, amend it.  

- If you can, try and get somebody else to read your applications once in a while, for another perspective. Another person’s input is always appreciated in my eyes.

- Go and see a career’s advisor, face to face if possible, even if you feel like you don’t need help. I contacted the National Career’s Service and was able to book an appointment with a really helpful advisor, and was given a lot of useful info and an action plan. We even discussed stuff that I had never even thought about.  Most importantly, it made me feel a lot more positive and boosted my morale. 

-  Volunteer if you can. I originally was rejected from a voluntary role which made me feel pretty rubbish! I did it to fill the gaps in my CV but found that it’s been the most valuable experience of my life to date. I started volunteering at the Citizens Advice Bureau, and came away with a bunch of skills to add to my CV. The experience you get is invaluable, not to mention the job satisfaction! If it appeals to you, look into various charities as a lot of them are always wanting volunteers and more likely to say yes.

- Also mentioned above; quality not quantity. Aim for 2 or 3 applications a day, (depending on your schedule) but perfect them. 

- If you’re a pretty outgoing, chatty and confident, maybe look into recruitment consultant or sales roles, but look at those with a base salary plus commission, rather than 100% commission. Worst case scenario, you’ll be let go after a month, but you’ll have a month’s pay and a month’s experience.

- learn a new skill/hobby in your spare time. I tried to learn coding, then learn French, but I was awful at sticking to them but so wish that I did. Looking back in my 3 years of unemployment, I could have achieved a lot of things and this is probably my biggest regret. Not only will you be able say that you taught yourself whatever, but you will enjoy it and it will give you a break from looking at Microsoft Word all day. You may want to look into admin or customer service courses too, or something quite widely applicable to give yourself a better chance

Remember it’s about you now. Stay positive as much as possible. Don’t take rejections personally. Prioritise your work, but keep in mind that you won’t be losing anything from applying for a job that requires experience or has a 40k salary. Sorry for the long wall of text. I don’t even know if this will help you at all, but I just wanted to pitch in because I know how annoyingly difficult it is, and even how hard it is coping emotionally.  Feel free to ask me anything or completely ignore me, but I wish you all the best in your search!

For instance, teenagers with trust funds do not have legal title to property, but they have trustees who will hold the legal title of that property for them - however they do have an equitable interest.  

What you heard about is called a **constructive trust**, this is the most popular equitable remedy for the dispute that you anticipate - this usually imposes at first a 50-50 share in the equitable (not legal) interest. This will mean that if the house is sold you would have to give her her half of the proceeds of sale, you may even have to consult. As she is not paying any purchase price it may be useless to discuss any resulting trust remedy. 

A court may find that she should hold a proportionate share of your property - as she through paying for living costs actually indirectly helping you pay the mortgage as she is acting to her detriment. If you are really concerned about this. consult your  lawyer - they would probably  advise you to make clear to her that you do not intend for her to hold any part of the property and go on from there.

His best position is right behind the striker...problem being, Eriksen should be playing there and Chadli is useful in that slot, additionally Lamela is fully capable of playing off striker, as is Bentaleb, Paulinho and Holtby. All of whom are probably better creators at that slot even if they aren't as strong a finisher.

In a deeper CM role he isn't as good defensively as Paulinho, Sandro, Capoue, Dembele or Bentaleb. He isn't as able to move the ball up the pitch as Dembele, Paulinho or Holtby. And he isn't as good a creator as Holtby or Bentaleb (and potentially Carroll).

Siggy has a rocket for a leg and a good attitude, but compared to what we already have on the roster he doesn't bring enough of a rounded game to displace any of the other members of the squad. Makes him a bit of an odd man out.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"This isn't quite right either - it's true that technology removes more jobs than it creates, but at the same time it doesn't mean a reduction in overall jobs.

What instead happens is that the efficiencies created by new technology allow things to be cheaper and faster. This gives everyone more time and money to spend on other things. This surplus of spending money basically creates new industries because people just love shit to spend their money on.

Consider the mechanical loom - sure it might take a few more people to manufacture them, but nowhere near the number of people who lost jobs from operating them.

But then clothes ended up a fraction of the price and instead today we can all go buy that fancy Starbucks coffee instead - meaning there's an extra 10,000 people employed as baristas instead.

Again with farming, with automation and machinery a single man can do the job that 50 used to do - and as a result we can all eat copious amounts of food and even meat every day for less money than people used to stave on! You might think food prices are high today but in truth we've barely ever had it so good.

And repeat again with transportation, banking, retail, etc.

I think banking is a brilliant one because if it wasn't automated to the extent it is today, then to process all of the transactions around the world in the way it used to be done before the unstoppable march of technology - (on paper, by hand!) - we could be employing all 7 billion people in the world in the banking industry and *still* not be able to keep up with it all!

Sometimes you've just got to step aside and do something else. Figure out what people want to spend money on next and go do that instead.

Of course this all only works as long as there is good competition - with many industries today there still generally is. This ensures that the price DOES in fact go down due to the new technologies. People use their efficiencies to undercut the opposition, gain customers, and so on. This pushes other to further do the same thing.

But in other industries it's a load of horse shit of course. Energy, for example - gas and electric - it's practically a cartel.

This is why regulation and competition laws are super important. As long as you ensure no monopolies and cartels, you can get a pretty good run out of this system.

true,Thapricorn,lfc-08-09-grey-kit,null,"The thing is, no two Liverpool matches are the same, regardless of the scores. What has impressed me beyond belief this season is just how *flexible* and *versatile* Brendan has made this team. We're not a one-trick pony and have shown the ability to adapt to rise to the occasion. Let me show you what I'm talking about:

**Liverpool 1-0 Manchester United**

This game was about true grit. It was a true smash-and-grab, and then bunker down performance. We got the early goal and showed good attacking play, but it was a tug-of-war with the Mancs (who at that point hadn't realized yet how shit they are). It was a battle about who wanted it more. We did. And we didn't even have Suarez.  

**Liverpool 5-1 Norwich**

 This was the Luis Suarez show. Brendan has built a *team* above all, but that day we showed why we have currently the absolute best player in the world. Suarez was masterful. He was scintillating. He was inhuman. That performance from him will be talked about for ages and ages. He'll go down in history for what he did that night. 

**Tottenham 0-5 Liverpool**

No Gerrard, no Sturridge, no wins at White Hart in nearly 3 years, no problem. A young midfield core that Brendan unveiled showed a different side to us: Breathtaking pressure. We did not let up for a second. They said Tottenham's midfielders would be bigger, harder, and stronger than ours. They were wrong. We bossed the middle of the park with intelligent, and brutal pressing. It was a team in complete synchrony. Every player knew where they had to be and they brought the game to the Spurs. That was a symphony orchestrated by Rodgers.

**Liverpool 4-0 Everton**

We actually didn't see much of the ball this game. Everton had a lot of possession, and you know what? We didn't give a fuck. We let them pass around the midfield and back 4 no problem. But the second they so much as thought about sending a ball into the box, or surging forward, Henderson and Coutinho clamped down like bear traps and were ferocious. Anything that got past those two, Gerrard abruptly put an end to with an imperious performance from the captain. We may not have had much of the ball, but when we did, SAS were ruthless. They ended the game with clinical finishing and took no prisoners. 

**Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal**

The game was over before it even began. Those 20 minutes of football were undoubtedly the best period of play I have *ever* witnessed Liverpool put forth. We were brutal, ruthless, and swift. It was a demolition job of Arsenal's title hopes. The ferocity with which we attacked reminded me of just one word: **Blitzkrieg**. There was no stopping our offensive force that game. And the scary thing? Suarez didn't even score. We weren't even as clinical as we should have been. It could have, and should have been 7 or 8. 

**Manchester United 0-3 Liverpool**

Old Trafford. The Theatre of Dreams. Not anymore. We came in there, and we owned every inch of that field. The Manchester United logo on the side of the building was a mere footnote on a page that was written entirely by Brendan Rodgers' men. We showed absolutely no fear that game, and bossed every second of the match. It should have been 4 or 5 nil, with a clear penalty on Sturridge not given and Gerrard showing us he's only human by missing 1 penalty. Again, the scary thing? SAS were nowhere near as good as they could have been that game. It would have been a massacre if they turned in a usual performance. 

**Cardiff 3-6 Liverpool**

Common sense tells you that you're rarely going to win a football match if you concede 3 goals. Well, you are if you have Suarez and Sturridge in the team. This was a shootout. Our defense was shaky. But that doesn't really matter when we have strikers who have what seems to be a telepathic bond between them. We went to Wales and said ""Anything you can do, we can do better"". And we did. Sure, we let in three goals, but THAT MEANS FUCK ALL IF WE SCORE SIX.  



Long story short: **THANK YOU BRENDAN RODGERS**. He's building a team that is professional, play attractive attacking football, and is built for the future and to last a long time. The direction we're headed is amazing, and so long as Rodgers is navigating this ship (we've got our skipper Stevie), we're headed for glory. No matter where we finish this season, and top 4 seems all but guaranteed now, Rodgers has gone above and beyond my wildest expectations. If you told me 7 months ago that we would even be *talking* about a title run, I would have slapped the tinfoil off your head. *At the end of a storm, there's a golden sky*, and thanks to Brendan Rodgers, I can see the storm clearing up.

The discussion around the Euro involved zero discussion of the economic benefits or risks. The same will be true of currency union. If Scotland votes for independence there is absolutely no chance of a currency union. People in rUK have already hardened against the idea, and rightly or wrongly will interpret a yes vote as a big ""fuck off"" from Scotland. The notion that people will then opt for a currency union is farcical. 

Incidentally, I also don't think it would be a good idea (for rUK, it would be great for iScofland) but it's not even worth breaking down why, because it won't be relevant. 

I love Scotland. It will sadden me if Scotland votes to leave, but I'll wish you well all the same.

I also wouldn't recommend just showing up and expecting to find a ticket off somebody on the street, you will be extremely disappointed and waste a huge amount of time and effort.

It would be an extremely big long shot and could be a bit time consuming/not worth it, but there is always the offbeat chance of contacting any of the US supporter clubs and asking if they did handling of getting tickets for that game. I know the one NYC supporters club held ticket events when the the first half of the season went on sale to enable people in the supporters club to get tickets to games that the supporters club had a chance at.

What I'm trying to get at is there's an extremely offbeat chance someone belonging to a US supporters club has a ticket for that game and could be in some situation where they can't go and still happen to have a ticket.

Thing is many supporters clubs will only really sell tickets to people who are in the supporter club, so you might be faced with that obstacle and extra bit of annoyance. Also they might be a bit cautious since you might appear as some random person.

Again it is an extreme long shot but weirder shit has happened. My good friend had two extra tickets to the home game against Everton, tweeted the one supporters club's handle, they retweeted and hooked a guy up who happened to be in Liverpool for a conference who didn't have tickets. So while the odds are extremely against you and you might look foolish seemingly spamming all the supporters clubs, it's probably the only thing you could really do.

Because Moffat thinks that ""everything is a paradox, stop asking questions"" is a brilliant and creative way to resolve a plot.

Villa lost Karim El Ahmadi and Andreas Weimann to injury within a minute of each other in the first half, but Lambert said on Sky Sports 1: ""We were definitely second best. That wasn't good enough.

""We got off to a really good start, within five minutes things were looking okay - we lost a couple of lads to injury, Andy and Karim - but (beside that) we were still second best.

""We had a really good start and got a really good goal, but the goals we lost were really, really poor.

""We take nothing away from Stoke, they deserved to win the game.

""(The injuries) do disrupt you a little bit but I'm not going to use that as an excuse.""

Next up for Villa is a trip to Manchester United next weekend and Lambert is confident his side can put in a good display following last week's 1-0 victory over league leaders Chelsea.

He added: ""We'll be really up for it. Like the Chelsea game, no one expects us to get anything.

They did have access to a small library though, and it was part of the county library system. This meant they could get pretty much any book they wanted by ordering it in, as long as it was in the system/another library. Just like you would in your local library if they didn't have a certain book you were looking for.

There were some genres that were banned. Things like true crime, martial arts instructions, how to break out of prison for dummies, etc. But generally the prisoners could get hold of any book, and they had regular access to the library.

But prisons aren't nearly as standardised as you might imagine, so this could just be the case for one particular prison.

Bullshit. If I'm wrong, explain so. Because right now you seem to be saying a union will be rejected just because it will. You claim people are against it, but refuse to explain why.

I said hes hasn't studied this monetary economics, you strawman man it into me saying hes incompetent, and attack that strawman.

&gt;Perhaps, but then that's moving the goalposts, he has additional experience in economics, by having a significant position in a significant bank.

Economics as used in a bank is different from academic economics. Bank economics is far more shallow.

Seriously you haven't done any reading on the subject have you. If you are just here to argue than I'm wasting my time.

 There seems to have been a serious failure of governance at this school.  This could not have happened without the governors electing the radicals to the board in the first place. That was the first mistake.  The second was not removing them once their intent became clear.  Somehow the radicals took over the board of governors.  

This is not surprising.  There is a lot of training available for school governors, but in my experience, there is nothing to train them to defend against the kind of aggressive corporate takeover this would have involved.  The tradition of primary school governorship in the UK generally attracts lovely people who act in a spirit of public service to do their best for the pupils.  I recently acted to defend my school (I am a governor) from a similar attack.  Not from a madras, but from a federated academy trying to absorb us ( we are the sole remaining secular non-academy in the region).  It's not difficult to do.  You just need the stones to stand up to the ""invaders"" and vet your potential new governors and consultants carefully and comprehensively.  This is often not done.  There is such a shortage of school governors, they often accept anyone who volunteers (CRB check not withstanding).  This was probably the mistake here.

I think we need some strategic defence training for governors, but I suspect government would be unable to provide it for fear of being seen as xenophobic.  If there are any governors or secular OFSTED inspectors out there interested in forming a group to look into this, I'm up it.",0,1395650908,null,0,false,0,cgafwig,t3_2173oi,t1_cgafwig,t3_2173oi,null,1433043082,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27

true,DuskytheHusky,null,null,"I train there early every morning because I work on George Street, so here's a rundown:

* The equipment is excellent, there is a massive range of cardio machines, and the rowing machines are Concept 2s. There are plenty of mats for stretching, or doing some weird freakydeaky yoga poses like some of the old men do. 

* The weights machines are great, there are 2 of the most popular ones too so you very rarely have to wait to use one. There are three cable machines too, which is rare in a commercial gym, let alone a 24hr one.

* The free weights area isn't too bad, there are 2-30kg DBs (not really heavy enough at the high end, but that doesn't affect most people). There is only one squat rack though, and one smith machine, so if you go any time that isn't super early/late, you'll have to wait to use them. Extra olympic bar, small bar and EZ bar too. 

* The staff are friendly enough, if sometimes pretty useless - some of the personal trainers there don't seem to have too much of a clue (unsurprisingly), but there are two that seem pretty switched on

* It's clean, the showers are pretty decent and there are always tons of lockers, and for £15.99 it's a steal

* You get to see the most hilarious people in there from time to time, there are some real characters, who seem oblivious to the rest of the world going on around them

Downsides:

* *Do not* go between 5-7pm on weekdays, it's fucking mental in there. It's a combination of those girls who think that slowly cycling on a bike whilst reading Closer will get them to look like Cheryl, and some total meathead estate agent gymbros who are unaware of exercises that aren't curls. You won't get anywhere near any weights, and will have to wait for cardio machines.

* You have to wear flip flops in the shower, but that's just common sense. The floor feels a mixture of slimy and sticky, but that's to be expected really.

I say go for it OP, I'm glad I did. Just find the best time to go (if you're working then I suggest 6/7am or 8/9pm) when it's relatively quiet, and you can crack on with things. Plus...it's only £15.99

Most countries are too interdependent economically for war to be a remotely worthwhile thing to do.  So the military brass are probably loving Russia appearing to act like dicks (despite all the nuances and complexities of the situation, which they're ignoring), because they get to weave narratives like this around it.

The main thing is I was paying all the proper UK taxes, despite the views of some people here, the tax man is very strong and ruthless in going after the simplest of errors.

So work out how that is going to work.  If you are billing this London client from your E&amp;W (I assume) registered company, how will VAT work?  Are you then billing a USA company?  If you are employing a US person, then you will find a world of paperwork.  A UK company employing a US person without a US entity to employ them for you is just not worth the hassle.

As such the best thing you can do is a be an agency.  You aren't doing anything wrong by buying work from a USA company, and selling it to a UK company, so long as you get any tax correctly done.

But once again we can not simply afford to give everyone who comes to the country benefits straight off the boat, especially if they have decided to move here at their own free will and are not seeking asylum, which is completely different case. 

i would all be for raising the benefits if we can have a lot of evidence that they have contributed towards the system and intend to continue to do so. No one deserves to be put in a position ere they get nothing out of a system they have contributed too.

So they join the euro which is worth 85pence per euro during stagnation. The UK has seen an unprecedented amount of inflation in the last few years which has eroded the value of the pound. If you're going to vote yes presumeably you care more about democracy -  that the currency, rightfully, should be discussed as and when a referendum takes place. Anything else is fearmongering. 

&gt;Don't worry the EU will let you in immediately with no concessions.

No disrespect but they let in Romania and Bulgaria and tried for Ukraine who have such an incredible low standard of living. You'd literally be smoking crack if you think the EU would turn down a highly educated, high productive country like Scotland. 

&gt;Don't worry oil is going to pay for lower taxes, higher public spending, free education (including educating English students for free), free childcare and free prescriptions.

Scots already have free university education. As do a bunch of countries in the EU like Sweden/Norway etc. In fact you could argue the major issue of contention the Scots have is the incredible Americanisation style privatisation of public sector services. 

&gt;Don't worry you'll still be ""British"".

By every definition - Scotland is still on the british isles. 

&gt;Don't worry we'll join NATO and be under the nuclear umbrella despite forcibly removing Faslane and having a small defence force that won't meet treaty commitments.

That's your interpretation you've twisted. As long as the meet 2 percent GDP spending I can't see why they wouldn't be. 

Honestly, the only people that are against Scottish independence are borderline nationalists. If you believe in better proportional representational democracies then you'd support it as well as support Welsh independence.

All these scams and companies like Tupperware, Avon etc do. And they all look absolutely wonderful on the examples they send you. And then once you've bitten and signed up you quickly find the reality is far from what was on that example they sent you.

The question you need to ask yourself when they send the cashflow figure is ""if its so good then why are they doing this instead of doing it themselves?"" 

I'll give you a dose of reality. I rent out a house which I owned for many years and have a 50% LTV mortgage on it. The rental income is the average for the area. Even though the mortgage is interest only I'm only drawing £2500 a year and thats if there's no repairs, the property is let out 100% of the year and the rent is paid. If it were on a repayment mortgage I'd be very close to have to find money out of my pocket for the tax bill. I'd hate to think what the situation would be if I were on a 85% LTV.

They will, *if it's best for rUK in the event of a ""yes"" vote*. The current ""nay"" is political posturing, it's not based on what's best for the country. Having all Scottish banks dump their sterling holdings on the open market overnight will not be good for the UK economy. 

&gt; Don't worry the EU will let you in immediately with no concessions.

They pretty much have to unless they want to set a precedent for leaving the EU (hello UKIP). If Scotland were out with the EU it would give UKIP support a massive boost and potentially lead to the UK leaving. 

The impact to that to business across Europe will be significant as well as thousands of workers will lose their right to be in the country. Then there are the taxation implications of cross-border trade which overnight becomes out with the EU. You have no idea on the pain this will cause accountants in every firm across the EU that has dealings with Scotland. 

It's in no one's interest to prevent entry. And don't give us the ""you must join the Euro"" crap; half of all recent new entries to the EU aren't on the Euro and they have no plans to do so. I'd like to hear what other ""concessions"" you've been told to believe in. 

&gt; Don't worry oil is going to pay for lower taxes, higher public spending, free education (including educating English students for free), free childcare and free prescriptions.

We already have all that without the need for full political control. The only thing that could ""break"" this would be if we were somehow unable to look after ourselves without the help of London. 

And no one is saying oil will do this. Our economy is strong because of a variety of industries with oil being only a minor part. Not paying for nuclear submarines and illegal wars in the middle east tends to strengthen your budget. 

&gt; Don't worry we're going to become a tax haven and overtly try to steal business away from rUK but they're going to give into all our demands anyway ""for old time's sake"".

Wat? 

&gt; Don't worry you'll still be ""British"".

We will. Our political representation is under question, not our core culture. We don't have to hand in our Fawlty Towers boxsets. 

&gt; Don't worry we'll join NATO and be under the nuclear umbrella despite forcibly removing Faslane and having a small defence force that won't meet treaty commitments.

NATO will not give up one corner of the GIUK gap, not under any circumstance. If you do not know what that means then you shouldn't be commenting on this. No one leaves NATO anyway, it's not ""allowed"". 

&gt; Don't worry about any future desire for the Scottish Islands to become independent or join the UK 

There is no political support for that, absolutely none. 

&gt; and take a tonne of oil with them because we're going to deny them the self-determination that we've been telling everyone else is a fundamental human right that can't be denied for decades upon decades.

Except they wouldn't because in your ridiculous and impossible scenario they'd be considered enclaves under international law which nets practically no territory gain and in this case, none of the oil. 

Not that it matters, oil is only a small part of Scotland economy. Folks like you seem to be willing to believe it's all we have aside from the heroin trade. It's this ""you depend on oil"" attitude that sickens us and drives us away.

&gt;You'd literally be smoking crack if you think the EU would turn down a highly educated, high productive country like Scotland.

All the EU countries have to agree on new members, and has been pointed out many times, the Spanish will not permit the precedent of a territory splitting away from a member country, then joining the EU, to happen. 

As with a few other points, the Yes campaigns position depends other countries acting in Scotland's best interest above their own.

A right they currently deny to any English that apply. However, if they become independant and join the EU, this will be illegal.

true,michaelisnotginger,cnty-scotland,"Scottish-Italian, will deep fry your pizza","I think there are some positive aspects to marketisation actually. It stops the top universities using and relying on their prestige as a brand. If you look at the higher education sector over the last 10 years there has been a massive increase in facility provision, sporting facilities and accommodation etc. My old university (York) has built a lot of nice new accommodation and is in the process of replacing its asbestos-ridden 60s stuff, has built a new sports centre and strength and conditioning complex, introduced 24hr library provision and widened the access of journals, built new postgraduate study areas, brought in a new way of procuring books, improved career fairs and so on. All things that people had been clamouring for for 20+ years. All this has meant that from a student's point of view, it is a far more enticing prospect to study at than it was when I started 5+ years ago (tuition fees aside, which I haven't come to a personal decision on)

Now would these have eventually happened? Yes probably, but the fact that they have to compete from not only other Russel/94 groups but up and coming ex-polys must have sharpened minds somewhat

There are however aspects I do disagree with, including spirallling salaries for top admin, a focus on plumping league tables, and overprovisioning humanties courses because they are comparatively much cheaper than STEM. I studied English and in comparison to my gf (Chemistry) it costs a fraction than it does to run one small NMR machine.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"&gt; I don't think you can say all those things with such certainty.

No, but it has been happening for the entirety of recorded human history - it's a pretty solid trend! But more than a complete rebuttal to what you said, I'm more arguing that saying ""technology removes jobs"" is actually irrelevant because of all the indirect effects of this. (But please read below anyway for the counter-side)

&gt; Your comment was so sure of itself that it has confused me a little.

I'm not so sure of it, no - I'm mainly just explaining what has happened up to this point in time, which is factual. So to continue, and clarify:

To extend these past patterns into the future we should not be so short sighted to think that things can't change and that unprecedented economic patterns may occur even in the near future. And after all we are facing unprecedented shortages in some resources that will surely cause some weird economic bumps (or mountains!) - some economists predict we have far far worse than our last recession in our near future simply due to oil depletion, for example.

But basically the idea here is that we know what I have said is true of how our world works - if you or whoever believe the future will be otherwise, then you need to form the argument on a basis of change.

Ie. The questions one needs to answer if they claim technology will remove jobs that won't be replaced are: What is different about today that wasn't true of past situations where technology advanced and removed workers in a given industry? And how will those changes actually affect future job creation, personal wealth, etc?

One of the tricky things of course is predicting what industries will replace the current ones that we make obsolete. It's hard because they don't exist yet - and if you knew what they'd be then you should get working on them and you'll be a billionaire in a decade or two! Predicting these things in advance is difficult, and they evolve gradually building on past ideas. But not knowing what industries will replace the ones that technology today is replacing is not argument enough alone to say that overall jobs will be lost. People often turn this short sightedness into doom and gloom assuming the future holds only unemployment.

So yeah, **tl;dr:** the future is uncertain but technology replacing jobs is not the reason to worry. If there's a reason to worry then it's other things - energy, resources, monopolies, corruption, greed, etc. You pick a theory and decide how likely it is - you're probably not going to be much more wrong than anyone else as we're all guessing! :)

By the way just cos I seem to like typing so much, how about a more recent example:

Computers (and the internet) - it was mere decades ago that computers were replacing jobs and so many assumed it was the beginning of the end. Entire departments laid off due to automation. But do I even need to tell you how many jobs only exist today because of them? You try and find someone who predicted even a fraction of *that* 30 years ago! Who could consider that we would have so much free time in the future that we'd be sitting around looking at a screen and pressing buttons to control a game? And how many tens or hundreds of thousands of people are employed now just to make that new form of entertainment? That industry employed 0 people half a century ago, there was simply no concept that it would ever happen, ever exist, and now it is the livelihood of so many! Repeat again with every type of online business, and hell websites themselves - almost every single one of the millions of websites created employment!

But hey, moving on once again - another interesting aspect of technology replacing jobs is, of course:

How many jobs do we even need?

How many hours do we need to work?

And hell, *do we* all even need to work at all?

As crazy as it sounds we work less today and/or get far more for it than at any point in the past (maybe not the immediate past - like say 5-10 years ago... but as an average and even from a few decades ago and onwards for thousands of years we are way better off!)

Hell, we have a society so efficient now that we can literally give money and food to people who sit at home doing nothing! People often see this as a negative, but it is really a testament to what we have achieved with technology and efficiency. You see concepts popping up like ""basic income"" where every citizen gets some money simply for existing - and these ideas are actually sustainable. This money is not hoarded away - it is spent and merely creates even more economic activity. Consider how when someone gets JSA today, within a couple of weeks that money is in the pockets of a) the government through tax, and b) people with jobs. Assuming you work, some of your income is due to the economic activity of unemployed people, people on DLA, child benefit, etc. And some of your wage ends up back in the government to give money to these people. It actually ensures the economy doesn't stagnate, and provides more benefits than most people would imagine.

Not to say we should all sit around and let robots do everything for us - but the argument that technology opens up avenues for us to do new things, work on other endeavours, hobbies, have more free time, and so on are quite valid.

Consider this in human-power instead of money (and sorry these numbers are all made up, but just to convey the idea)...

If 300 years ago it took the economy 20 human-hours of labour per week to provide for your needs: food, energy, etc. for a single person - from the whalers out at sea collecting blubber to light your house, to the farmer digging up carrots for your dinner, and even the boy sweeping your chimney. And thus chances are you'd have to work quite a bit more than 20 hours to be able to afford these things - let's say you worked 50. There's economic overheads, people making profit, and hey you might want money for other stuff too!

How many human-hours do you think it takes today to provide the same level of service to you? Some energy for your house? Food? So automated now those 20 hours could be say 2 hours now with all these efficiencies.. and where you used to have to work 50 hours in the week just for those things, you now have to work 5. And not to mention you're eating more, healthier, more luxuriously, and possibly not even cooking it yourself and still coming out on top!

But of course now you have a mobile phone bill, internet, phone, TV, and don't forget you've gotta go out this weekend with your mates, and don't forget that holiday you're flying halfway round the world this year! And plus you're buying books, games, movies, and all manner of other shit.

So let's say for a moment that you stop wanting more and more shit all the time while things are become cheaper. Try working 20 hours a week and living live someone who worked 40 hours a week a hundred years ago. You'll find you have plenty of money and plenty of free time to live your life too!

There is one caveat though: Fucking housing today is expensive, haha. But we live in an overpopulated country in an overpopulated world, but hey that's another story.

From the University of Glasgow's website regarding John McLaren (the only one of the report's authors listed);

&gt;Political Status
&gt;
&gt;John was a civil servant at both H.M. Treasury (1985-1988) and at the Scottish Office (1989-1998). During this period he had no political affiliations.
&gt;
&gt;John worked as a researcher for the Labour Party for a year leading up to the first election (1999) of the new Scottish Parliament, being subsequently appointed as a Special Adviser by Donald Dewar, and then by Henry McLeish, for the period up to 2001. John was a member of the Labour Party from 2000 to 2005. In 2006 John was hired by the Labour Party on a consultancy basis to undertake work leading up to the 2007 election.
&gt;
&gt;Since 2002 John has worked as an independent economic consultant and member of CPPR. Since 2005 he has had no political affiliations.

[Link](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/cppr/whoweare/)

John might have handed back his party membership card in 2005 but are we really to believe that he has no political leanings at all?

We pay quite a few people less than the out of London living wage, however the jobs they work in typically attract young, single people who stay for 2-3 years. While I'm sure if you asked them they'd like more money, they all seem to enjoy a decent standard of living and can afford to piss a decent amount of it away every weekend. The living wage is formulated on an average of the requirements of a variety of different circumstances.

However the real reason I'm not convinced is that the work our sub livingwagers do is easily replaced by a machine. At the current wages there is no case to invest in the machinery. Raising the minimum wage to the living wage would make us look at this situation more closely, at probably £8pp it would be a no brainer.

The RMT and bob crow did nothing more than provide a few good years for tube drivers while TFL invest in driverless trains. I think a move to the living wage could have the same effect but on a massive scale and we'd only be hastening the already looming problem of a society that doesn't need a manual labour force.

In short the argument goes like this. The creation of additional demand will be met by automation. As in, we will create entire new industries that need a workforce. But all those workforces will be robots.

&gt;We've had hundreds of years of manual work being mechanised and automated, massive population growth, and decades of production moving abroad, and yet unemployment still isn't a run away problem.

I really do believe this time is different. For instance, whereas before automation meant we could make our workforce more productive - use 10 employees to make 1000 boxes of weetabix an hour instead of 100 before we the addition of automation - there will come a time when we only need 1000 boxes of weetabix.

You haven't explained anything.  You said that cyclists have the same responsibilities to other road users as HGV drivers do.  But HGV drivers are required to take training above and beyond that required by other road users.  They are held to much higher standards than other road users, because the law recognises that they are more dangerous than other road users.  That is why their working conditions are heavily regulated.

Cyclists are not dangerous vehicles.  In fact, in the UK, only about 1 pedestrian every 2 years is killed by a cyclist.  That compares very, very well with the 1,600-1,700 killed annually in motor vehicle collisions.

You're making assumptions that economic growth is the non plus ultra, the highest priority of these countries (and it's not just Spain and the UK). The prospect of a European federation, and peace in Europe, is leading to a long term trend towards regions wishing to become nations, and that is a threat to many of the unitary states that currently exist, which are invariably more interested in their integrity than in marginal economic growth. And European authorities are not necessarily all that keen, firstly because they don't want to position themselves as an alternative to nation states, and secondly, because there is a risk of instability. Scotland, then Catalonia, then the Basque Country, then Flanders, Corsica, Venice, Sicily, Wales, Brittany, and then god knows where*. At the least, the EU and the member states will not want to make the process easy.

&gt; The pound isn't worth as much as brits think these days. 

Apart from the rather limping double entendre (!) the vast majority of people in Britain support the Pound over the Euro, and with good reason. If anything, our debt/deficit figures before the recession were worse than Greece and Spain, and we were also massively exposed to any collapse in finance. The pound is probably the single greatest reason why were weren't utterly fucked by 2008. By contrast, Spain and Ireland went through enormous housing booms in the early 2000s, and the ECB cut interest rates to record lows, to prop up the German economy, and in so doing, fuelled housing booms elsewhere. I wonder why the Euro works well for the German economy! Anyway, regardless of the economics, support for the Euro is at rock bottom, and any British (including Scottish) politician advocating the Euro is engaging in electoral suicide.

We need to have a very credible attack to force other teams to adopt to defending us.  Right now, teams know we're a toothless tiger and just sit back and wait and beat us on the counter.

If our threat to score were stronger, even without being as good as other teams:

1 - Teams would no longer just hang back and wait for the inevitable petering out of the attack to counter-attack

2 - We'd score more goals on weaker squads, allowing us to have confidence in our rotations to keep our best XI fresh for the big matches

3 - We'd stop having these frantic ""fall behind then try to win on a miracle surge"" matches

4 - Our defensive play would improve as teams spend more of their on field strategy and player selection on defending, leaving fewer options on attacking us.

A credible midfield and a credible finisher(s) would dramatically alter our prospects against the bigger teams, while dominating the smaller teams.  I think the players, all brought together in short time and then going through two managers, will, if THFC gets the right team in place on the staff, be young, fast and creative now with a season of PL under their belts.

If it's beyond that really has to replace it, he needs to prove the age of it and show that it requires replacement before the end of it's average lifespan (I dunno... say 5 years per replacement.. so if it cost £250 to replace, and it's 4 years old and you've broken it, you owe £50).

The carpet.. sounds like you caused it and should have made an effort to remove the stain, should probably pay for that. Professional cleaning is around £25-50 per room depending on size. so I think he's taking the piss there.

Mould damage is tricky. Theoretically you should've used watered-down bleach to at least have a go at the mould occasionally and especially before moving out. If he did advise you to clean using bleach and you didn't it's got to count against you. Condensation causing mould problems is usually down to poor ventilation and lack of heating - two things which you should be in control of, so he may have a point. Having said that, it can also be caused by poor insulation of an exterior wall/roof. If he's going to redecorate: how long since it was last painted? - factor this into the cost if he genuinely needs to do it. Once every 3 years for gloss paint is fairly standard.

Basically, things get worn and need replacing - if you cause the item to be replaced prematurely (e.g. it gets 3 years of use instead of 5) then it's reasonable that you pay for the lost years of use (so 2/5 of the cost in that example). The fact he's threatening you counts against him.

Keep a copy of anything you have in writing, if he's left you voicemails or anything, try to record them. Get hold of your DPS and let them know.

I'd probably contact the landlord and say that you're not willing to agree to any of the charges except for the carpet, but that he is quoting something which is clearly over the market rate (phone a couple of cleaners in the area and get a quote per sq metre or something). If he's not willing to budge then tell him you'll have to go to dispute via the DPS - add that him threatening you with a daily rate will be included in your evidence to them.",0,1395670454,null,0,false,0,cgajxrg,t3_21854t,t1_cgajxrg,t1_cgaj2bg,null,1433044984,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

[This deal](http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/sim-only/full-monty-sim-21-12m/t-mobile-combi-sim-paym/extras/) is the best I can find currently.  
Really though it was the 'two free boosters for life' aspect that made my plan such a good deal, plus the fact I took it out before they started limiting tethering.

**Spencer:** I'd be happy to help you on that

**Spencer:** You will get truly and totally Unlimited data  
**DEADBEEF:** Ah that's great thanks.  
**Spencer:** you're welcome.  
**DEADBEEF:** I understand that the unlimited internet offer is for phone data only (no tethering). If I *were* to tether to a laptop or tablet how is that data usage billed?

**DEADBEEF:** Yeah I saw that.  
**Spencer:** there is no charges for tethering on the sim deal.  
**Spencer:** but you will not be allowed to tether on it.  
**DEADBEEF:** Ah, so tethering usage is simply not allowed. not just billed outside of the included data?  
**Spencer:** Yes

Mould is indeed tricky. The bleach we used was commercial 'mould spray' (like you say, it's just diluted bleach) but once it got on the ceiling - which was some 12 feet off the ground - we couldn't safely spray it, hence why we wanted to contact the landlord for guidance if anything (or a ladder, or any kind of assessment). But we couldn't get hold of him and the agency, despite seeing the problem in all its glory, unhelpfully didn't tell anybody anything. And we have had 'people' suggest there is a problem with both the roof and the chimney, but obviously I can't speculate on that.

Oh yeah he is claiming lack of ventilation and drying clothes in bedrooms (he claims the agency backs him up on this, which is odd as this literally never, ever happened). But we like ventilation and our gas bill shows we weren't shy with heating either...

There. A scenario that is entirely justifiable for the police and easy to fake. A suicide, in the other hand, is really tough. If they *were* killed by police, the wounds would be entirely different and a simple autopsy (which very likely will occur) would easily notice the difference.

The current, post-2012, loans start at ~21k (charged at 9% on any earnings over 21k). On top of that, they're charging interest at RPI+3% on those loans (currently 6.3%).

1998-2012 loans start at ~16k (again, charged at 9% on any earnings over £16,365). On top of that they're currently charging 1.5% but it may rise to RPI (~3.3%) soon.

There's also the pre-1998 loans which have their own sets of terms.

Essentially, even with the large rise in interest rates (on a large amount of money), they're not going to get more money back than the old system where they were lending less money at lower interest rates and topping up the rest of university funding via general taxation. This is because people are not expected to earn enough money during their repayment period to cover the huge amount of money owed.

Basically, they've wasted a load of time, energy and money (as well as the LibDem's reputation) for absolutely fuck all.

&gt;This claim is untrue and irrelevant. Even VisitBritain, our national tourist agency, can't find any evidence for it.

&gt;Chester Zoo, Stonehenge and the Roman Baths are all more successful tourist attractions than Windsor Castle, which is the only occupied royal residence to attract visitors in large numbers. If Windsor Castle was included in the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) list of top attractions it would come in at number 24.

&gt;Research shows that tourists come here for our world class museums, beautiful scenery, fantastic shopping and captivating history - not because they might catch a glimpse of Prince Andrew. In a republic, royal properties such as Buckingham Palace would be open all year round, so visitors that do want to explore our royal heritage would have even more opportunity to do so.

true,AverageGeezer,irish,Essex Dubliner,"Welcome to the world of renting from idiot landlords.

Every place I have ever rented (4 in the past 4 years due to work) have tried to keep the deposit for stupidly obscene reasons - it appears that landlords and estate agents look at the deposit as a 'rent bonus' and do everything they can to cling onto it.

As for the charging you every day until it is resolved - this is complete hot air and a claim that no one will ever award him, ever, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.

My best advice for situations is along the lines of what I have done/learnt by past mistakes:

1: Be polite in all written communication and ensure that you at least appear to be trying to meet somewhere in the middle.  Reason: All these emails will be forwarded to the deposit scheme adjudicator at some point and being the good guy can help on those grey matters.

2: Keep a track of all communication in detail - ideally communicate solely via email.

3: Be weary of allowing the adjudicator to decide on the case.  Once you agree you cannot pursue in court if you lose.  I have found that refusing to allow the adjudicator to decide (they will then return your deposit to you as they are no longer involved) and instead asking to go to court with a long list of counter claims is enough to make these thieves back down.

4: Might be a bit late for this, and a very legal grey area which I'm sure someone will jump on but I always withhold the last months rent. Why? because I am yet to have an agency or landlord not try to claim my whole deposit for issues that were there before i even arrived.  With the deposit being normally 6 weeks rent, withholding 4 weeks ensures that I only have 2 weeks of money tied up in what is normally a 3-4 month battle.  The allows me to have enough to move and, despite it legally saying its not allowed, I inform the deposit scheme to release the last months rent from the fund or pay it directly once the claim has been ruled in my favour

5: Photos photos photos.  Take pics when you move in and the second you move out - declare all moving in photos to the landlord/agency regarding any damage etc and forward all pictures to the adjudicator should it go that far.

&gt;Branding expert David Haigh has tried to put a figure on the value of Britain’s Royal Family as a brand.  The sum he came up with: A whopping £44 billion - or $70 billion.

&gt;We were all surprised to find that we had under-estimated both the tangible and intangible value of the Monarchy. It is one of the most valuable of all British brands. Whatever one thinks about the constitutional principle, there seems little doubt that the institution of Monarchy adds significant annual earnings and long term economic value to the UK.

- the front page ""promises"" me that it doesn't matter if the housing market crashes.  beware any financial advisor who promises that something like this is guaranteed to increase in value.

- the front page also sets out how the tenant will pay your mortgage costs. no problem, but it makes no mention of what happens if you don't have a tenant or they can't afford the rent.  

the guy has massively over-simplified the BTL market in the hope of attracting (duping) people into giving him money.  i am sure he knows that it is more difficult than how he describes it, which is fine if you're doing a ""BTL for idiots"" blog, but if you do it when trying to sell your product/service i think it's pretty irresponsible.

i also think that the website design isn't exactly cutting edge.  that may be a useless personal opinion, but i also think it's a bit of a yellow flag for figuring out how serious the person you're contracting with is.

for some positive advice, here are some pointers you may find useful (and may or may not agree with). for the record, i'm not a huge fan of 'amateurs' getting into BTL, but your rationale is better than most:

- buy a property in an area that you are familiar with, and still spend time in.  you want to know the street you're buying on, know how close it is to things and the quirks that you may not be able to pick out from afar, like whether noise carries from the nightclub on the other side of the development. it also means that you can keep a personal eye on the property. you should also know who your target tenants are (students/professionals/social housing/other) and buy a property that will fit their needs.

- if you aren't going to be living nearby all the time (and even if you are), pay a local property management company, which you will be able to find in the yellow pages i'm sure, to look after things.  they will handle things like the tenant paying rent on time, calling a plumber to fix a broken pipe, even buying a new boiler for you (with your money), if the old one breaks.  choose a local one with an office that you can walk into and handle business in person, in case things don't go according to plan.

- understand the risks.  imagine a scenario where you rent the property to some people. after a while they stop paying the rent, and after 3 months of angry letters you decide to evict them.  you spend £x on legal costs getting them kicked out, at which point you discover that they have ripped up all the carpets, stolen the copper piping and broken every ground floor window out of spite.  it will take another 3 months to get the house back to a rentable condition and find new tenants.  will you be able to service a mortgage without a paying tenant for that period and will you be able to finance the repairs until your landlords insurance clears?

the last point is crucial.  this isn't common, but nor is it unheard of.  professional landlords have 10-12 properties (or more), partly to be diversified against this risk.  single property landlords run the small risk of a very negative outcome.",0,1395673398,null,0,false,0,cgal3lj,t3_2183bl,t1_cgal3lj,t3_2183bl,null,1433045532,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I did a speed awareness course after being done for 34mph in a 30mph limit.

The guy running the course said the majority of accidents on a motorway were actually at less than 10mph - slow moving traffic and drivers not paying attention that the car in front has stopped again. Crashes at high speed were much rarer.

Doing 45mph in a 30 zone? 6 points, 80 or 90 on a motorway should be situational.  If you're obviously driving dangerously then ticket, but if roads are clear and your perfectly safe then no charge.

For example a couple of weeks ago I was driving from Birmingham to Newcastle in the early hours.  At 4am I was the only car on the road for a majority of my journey, apart from the occasional truck in the inside lane - staying at 70mph didn't make much sense when I could do 90mph and still be just as safe and get home an hour earlier.

In such a small place, the killing of a town police officer is probably going to be a huge deal. I would imagine that a pretty large section of the town would know him personally, and as such would feel it much more than in many places in Britain, where less localised police forces handles crime over larger areas and populations. When that's the case (i.e. somebody a lot of people know dies), I think asking for a gesture like this is pretty much like holding a public funeral service. 

The ribbon might also serve the purpose of aiding the morale of the local police force, who, being a smaller group will likely be pretty shaken by this (can't find an exact number of officers for Windermere, but considering they only [get 54 calls a month](http://windermere.municipalcms.com/docview.aspx?docid=31017), I think it must only be a few), which is both considerate and self-serving.

As for if you'd really be considered a 'heartless SOB' for not doing it, I dunno, I just feel like that depends entirely on what sort of people live in the town. It may be that such pressure might come about where you live, or, for that matter, where I do, but that doesn't mean that's true of all places. 

And, just as you might feel you have to show up to a funeral or be considered an SOB, I think non-participation would be less about *making* people do something but more like the natural feeling of exclusion people get when they see a large group of others participating in something they're not a part of.

However: half of that £44bn brand value figure is tangible assets like land which would still exist if the monarchy were dissolved.

By different, and inevitably arcane, ownership routes these assets all belong to the country as a whole. They are appreciating assets which, at current best estimates, are worth £18 billion.  While the Monarchy employs these assets they belong to everyone.

Secondly, the annual tourism value is put at £1bn which is 0.067% of annual GDP. This is peanuts compared to total tourism, which is £101bn (or 6.7% of GDP). http://www.wttc.org/news-media/news-archive/2012/tourism-uk-contributes-more-gdp-automotive-manufacturing/ Also, without the monarchy there would be greater access to Royal estates which might make up for some of the £1bn lost.

So what you get are more superficial, easier degrees which more people can pass.

Tuition fees were the wrong move and were compounded by Labour's ridiculous target of 50% of students going to university. What's the point of that if you totally undermine the value of university education by eroding standards? Instead of a means of educating the next generation of leaders of industry, technology, law and politics, it's become a mechanism to shackle a large proportion of the population in debt. 

Another effect of turning universities into a market is that now they have to compete to appeal to their customers. On the surface this sounds good, but then you find that some universities offer courses in Forensic Science, demand directly generated by TV's CSI series. There are only a handful of such jobs in the UK and they are filled by people who started in a discipline such as biology or medicine and moved over. To me, that's little more than a scam.

I never tough about it until recently, but since I came into the UK I don't think I saw any children outside of school or not with their parents. When I was young, I would go on foot alone to school starting from first grade. By the age of 10 I could play outside with my friends until midnight as long as my parent knew where I was. When I was forth grade, me and my buddies would go hiking up hills and go into forests.

I have never heard of any cases of pedophilia or kidnapping in my region expect for one. I personally was victim of an attempted kidnapping when I was in primary school. Thankfully, it was not successful as I managed to run away. After a while tough, I returned to my usual routine.

Many of the children with overprotective parents by the end of high school were not judging social situations in a healthy way. They would be extremely submissive towards any person of little power over them and when given less constraints, they would cross lines.

I'm unsure how to feel about all this hysteria but I think that some research should be done towards it with hard numbers.

I personally find it a problem that the good players move on because it isn't helping the parity in the league.  Real and Barca might move players on, but they replace them instantly with another world class talent.  

Gettafe?  Doesn't have that kind of luck.  They may have a great player, but they are going to leave to the PL or Real/Madrid to make more money or have a shot at winning trophies... leaving Getafe to have to search for a lesser known gem yet again.  They may or may not have success... but the big teams are always going to have success because they have money.

It's just pretty shitty to watch Real/Barca vs Any team outside of the top 3.  You can pretty much figure out how the game is going to end, unless a freak accident happens.

true,Torquemada1970,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;My point is that a show satirizing the (then) current government and dealing with issues of burgeoning sexuality is not ""aimed at younger children only"".

And yet that's exactly what happened - you're arguing against well known history. I did expand on this in the following reply, but you've quoted the original post.

To look at it another way, one could say the same about younger viewers not being the target of the genocide 'do I have the right' issue in Genesis of the Daleks - so the question becomes ""how did they manage to address this sort of thing the right way before, but don't seem to be able to do it right now?"" - and the general consensus (this really isn't news) was that the show had been dumbed down to the point where the only people watching it in numbers were too young to follow the heavier stuff anyway. Hence, only (some of) the younger viewers kept watching it.

&gt;but that is a completely different issue from whether they were ""only for little kids, now""

Well, you brought that aspect up as a defence. I've just illustrated how that made no difference, and why.

&gt;Last I checked, little kids didn't go in much for political commentary on the relative merits of Tories in government.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; Timmy may take awhile to understand how to get us there, but when we do I see us as title contenders for awhile...

This is part of my issue of sticking with Tim....in all honesty we really don't have a huge amount of time to figure out how to propel the club upwards

There are 6 teams competing for 4 CL slots with the occasional overachiever in the mix as well (Everton, NUFC 2 years ago etc).

The unfortunate reality of getting CL qualification in the PL is that there are realistically 4 ways to do it.  Spending, Coaching, Coaching and Spending or innovation.

When you look at the other 5 teams in the race for 4 CL slots 4 of them can outspend us Chelsea, ManU, City and now that the stadium is paid for Arsenal can as well (still remains to be seen if they will), additionally LFC getting CL will likely ensure that the FSG spend money as well. 4 of the teams have better management (Mou, Pelligrini, Rodgers and Wenger and truthfully based on his whole career Moyes is better than Tim) than we do. We have shown nothing to indicate that we can be innovators of any kind that lands us in the CL slots.

That leaves us with one path, management....Tim is a likeable guy, the type of guy who you generally would want around a club (passionate, funny, honest etc), but he is nowhere close to being ready to lead the team in a run for a CL slot when the odds are stacked against him. We need to get a truly top notch manager to help propel us up the stack before the other teams start pulling away.

LvG is a short term solution in that he is the type of manager who can land us in CL competition very quickly but likely will not remain around for numerous years. LvG on the otherhand is probably a much more long term solution if you consider that he would be instilling a philosophy at the club that we could use as a foundation.  This would allow us to identify a successor quicker and maintain the level of performance.  With Tim we are not likely to be truly competitive with the other CL clubs and slowly but surely they will pull away from us.

If we truly want to be a regular CL team, we don't have time to screw around with a inexperienced manager, we need proven quality right now.

1) UK currency union - this is a particularly neat example of how Scotland is not really in a union with England but actually just a region of the UK. The British pound is theirs as much as Englands and actually maybe they don't want to 'share' it with England after independence?

2) Of course the EU will let it in eventually - with whatever reasonable restrictions on spending etc it needs to impose - why the fuck would they not?

3) Oil is going to provide far more income than it is fashionable to admit. Scotland has a population of 5 million - and decent oil reserves, great fishing and renewable wind and wave power, great tourism and agriculture and sophisticated banking and further education sectors. Significant high value exports particularly whiskey. It is positioned on the border of one of the worlds biggest economies and within the biggest economic union - all of which signal an enormous opportunity to thrive post independence.

4) Of course !?

5) They may not be in NATO but they will of course have nothing to fear given their location and historical connections with the US. Name one credible defence scenario that scotland would need to be worried about post independence.

6) Come on? Really? Scotland has been an independent nation for centuries. The right to self-determination for a few dozen people and their adjacent oil wealth is clearly absurd.

7) Pure fear mongering.

There's the constant Fez and Bowtie jokes, and any number of other ""dumbed down"" moments which take away from the series in my opinion.

The Doctor used to be able to walk these lines far more effectively. The heartwarming moments for children and families took the shape of genuine emotions and tragic love stories and joy and heartbreak that we could all feel. (The Girl In The Fireplace especially comes to mind.)

Sherwood's been around the club long enough to see a number of managers come and go. He has a relationship with the coaches, owners and innate knowledge of the youth system.

This has resulted in Universities needing to provide more and more places on courses in order to generate income. That's why lecture theatres have grown. Do you think a lecturer wants to repeat the same lecture 5 times in a week?

Staff are having to put more time into teaching and less into research, meaning they have less time to secure more grant funding, and so on. The other issue is that when you take on hundreds more students, you have to employ more administrative staff to deal with them - more costs to take care of.

The biggest issue right now is the lack of political coherence to this issue. We clearly have an issue of EU foreign policy. The Ukraine situation was instigated on behalf of the EU (whether legitimately or not) and Russia has intervened to dissuade the EU. So where is the EU in all this? If it is both belligerent and target you'd assume it would have some kind of cohesive response.

The problem with relations with Russia is they see the EU as a potential empire while in actual fact it is kind of bumbling around accidentally destroying the new Russian Empire before it starts. The EU needs to do one of two things:

1. Co-ordinate more precisely to avoid trampling all over Russia's interests. Secure peace by appeasing them and restricting further eastward expansion.

2. Co-ordinate more precisely to do the exact opposite. Bring soft power to bear on Russia and get some kind of solid agreement on cohesive deployment of hard power. With and without the US.

In both cases the situation requires more political co-ordination at EU level. Even if it is a cohesive plan to surrender the eastern partnership. We certainly can't really sit back and let the EU grow semi-consciously into areas that present real danger to partners.

true,Boiiing,null,null,"As the best choices are only visible with hindsight I think a pension pot built up between age of 0 to 20 can no doubt be educational. It will demonstrate the value of compound returns, equity investments and other good things. 

The frustration will be, the recipient cannot access this generous gift for another 40 years after they get old enough to appreciate it. They have to raise their own funds to get everything they need out of life.

Perhaps this will help them appreciate things more because they are saving for them and not having a pile of cash handed to them on a platter. However, in order to lever the pension pot as a leg up to help fund a house or a car, they have to effectively take the small amount of cash they would have otherwise contributed to a pension, and not put it in the pension, because they know they can get away without putting in the pension because it already has a kickstart amount in it. This is potentially a bad habit because by their late 20s they will have to start contributing properly to the pension, and in the meantime they may miss free cash from employer matching.

If you do *not* expect them to take a break from pensions in their early 20s, despite the existence of the kick start pot already in it, then you are basically saying they should suffer with the huge challenge of self funding a house, marriage, family, car, travel, relocation etc etc themselves, and your cash is just there to give them a nice retirement. 

Well thanks mum and dad I can figure out how to do retirement on my own over the next 40 years, just like you did, but I really would have preferred if you were sacrificing so much for me over the last 20 years, I could actually do something with it for myself and family before you die.

How are you so certain that the future is bright with Sherwood? Aside from the shellacking we gave NUFC, some wins against bottom-half table teams and Man U, he hasn't had many impressive results. 

Granted, Top 4 isn't 100% guaranteed with LvG. But if we go off of historical performances, than LvG is a betting man's choice.

Screaming and throwing things are not necesarilly passion. Even if they are, passion is not a quantifiable metric. Nor is it a reason to make someone a manager. If we take a bus ride through London, I'm sure we could find thousands of people with passion for Spurs. 

&gt;The theory that top managers leave a legacy of 'instilling a philosophy at the club that we could use as a foundation' is bollocks to me. Just look at Manchester United this year. SAF had to have left this philosophy behind, yet they are struggling even worse than we are this year....

Man U is one example. Personally, I believe its the aging squad thats causing the problems. But a better example of Top management leaving a legacy is Cruyff at Barcelona. Wasn't even there the time SAF was at Man U, but to this day, his philosphy is the reference point for the youth set-up, the B team, and the first team.

First of all, it's too long, should be 2 pages maximum, so adjust the width so the bullets are further to the left so it'll use fewer lines, put each section heading above the section instead of the same line so the bullets can use the blank space underneath...

I'd put the GCSE and A-level results into a small table so they can be formatted over only 2 lines, just put ""references available on request"" at the end instead of listing them, lose the ""award"" section as you just won a competition, unless it was a competition for selling the most copies of your own photo. (this is your sales cv)

Lose the social media section as well. They have your cv, the linkedin isn't needed. Also you say you have 3 cvs, which cv does the linkedin account match? if i go to your linkedin will it say you love education? photography? sales? - lose it from all 3 imo, and make your linkedin private - I did this while I was job hunting recently, it's too complicated to keep up with if you've different cv's flying around, which I did too, that's something you're doing right. 

I wouldn't bother with the colouring at the top either, you've just made it difficult to print out. 

As for each section 

Objective: 

Travelled? not relevant for a sales job unless it involves travel, ""enthusiastic"" or something like that is better. also you squeezed too much into your statement, lose ""seeking..."" onward, it doesn't say anything. Something like ""An enthusiastic, professional sales person with experience in online, retail and licensing sales, skilled at building relationships, leading and knowledge building"" would be better. 

Key Skills: 

The two about computers should just be one skill. ""An IT expert comfortable with MS Office, many other packages, and building computer hardware"" Otherwise they're okay, but you'll want to update them

Experience: Firstly, your ""other"" section down at the back is work experience, get that up front and first on the list - be proud that you've tried to be a self employed photographer, it shows entrepreneurial spirit, intelligence, a ""spark"" of something. If you're going for a sales job, people will take a chance on that spark, they get plenty of deadheads coming through every week, you have something else about you. I'd maybe lose the marriage photography job in japan as well to save space - your teaching has that time covered, if it doesn't, just stretch it so it does, no-one will check.

You need to put months on the cv, are you still at the camera centre? Have you left and you're trying to hide it? If i'm still employed I'd put (Dec 2012-present), if not (Dec 2012-Mar 2014). It provides clarity. 

The letter of recommendation... I'd feel a bit daft sending that off any where to be honest - I got an email from my boss that was as good as that letter you have, but I never felt I wanted to show anyone, if you're that good you'll shine out anyway, passing over a letter always makes me think I'm passing a letter from my Mum. I'd rather read the letter myself, and tell the interviewer how good I am. So I'd use the reference letter to gee myself up, if that makes sense.

The tearjerker being that the doctor loses a recently picked up companion. When all seems lost the doctor convolutes a plan with the 2001 aliens and the lost companion becomes a star-child. Cue existential chat with Bowman.

&gt; Conspiracy to Commit Offences outside England and Wales

&gt; A conspiracy may involve the doing of an act by one or more of the parties, or the happening of an event, in a place outside England and Wales which constitutes an offence in that other jurisdiction. This situation is covered by section 1A of the Criminal Law Act 1977 which provides that where (a) that act or event would be an offence by the law of that other country and (b) it would also be an offence here (but for the fact that it takes place outside the jurisdiction), then a person in England and Wales who becomes a party to the agreement or, being a party, does anything in pursuance of the agreement (even before its formation) can be charged with conspiracy contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977.

More than that, I don't think it really matters. I think if we sold either of them we'd take a big hit in terms of our league position, but then we'd presumably buy someone to fill that void. And I think that any top side will always have a few players that they'd seriously miss (Giggs for Utd when they were top, Henry/Viera for Arsenal, Hazard right now for Chelsea, etc). 

That said I think the stats are a bit imbalanced in that I'm fairly sure we've lost Suarez for fewer games this season than Sturridge, and I think that out of the two we'd miss him a lot more. 

Either way I definitely think the stats dispel anyone trying to claim that we're a one or two man team (not that I've heard anyone claiming that). We can definitely hold our own still in case of injuries. 

I also really don't see how anyone could possibly make a case that SAS aren't the best strike partnership in the Premier League right now (as people were earlier in the season).

Holy shit. You actually think the banking regulators would be OK with that? A bank just choosing to close millions of accounts out of spite from the main shareholder? Do you have any idea how these processes work? These things are written into every customers contracts with the bank so literally tens of thousands of contracts would require full legal reviews to close the accounts in a way that did not open the bank up to sanctions from the financial ombudsman or legal risks from pissed off customers as well as the non-majority shareholders. 

&gt; All bets are off.

Only if you live in la la land where there are no rules. 

&gt; I suspect the effect this line of reasoning has is demonstrates how air headed the yes campaign is. ""Oh we'll have the pound and the crown!

No, that just shows how utterly nonsensical your thinking is here. Why wouldn't Scotland get to ""keep"" the Crown? You think that would be a ""favour"" Westminster gets to hand out? You have no idea on how constitutional power is wielded in the UK! There isn't even the slimmest possibility of the crown saying ""no"" to an independent Scotland keeping it as it's sovereign. What you are arguing defies all logic!

We could keep the pound if we wanted, even without a formal currency union. Ireland did this for decades following their independence. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about here!

&gt; And we'll be in europe! 

We will. There is no legal process to strip someone of a EU citizenship they already have. We meet all of the EU's requirements. Saying ""no"" is in no one's interests and you are absolutely insane if you think Spain is going to throw in a spanner because of Catalonia. 

&gt; And we'll take all the UKs banks! 

""Take""? Who said that?

&gt; But we'll not bail them out! 

Again, who said that?

&gt; And we'll take the oil, but not the debt"". 

Dropping the debt only is mentioned as the ""nuclear option"" in direct response to retarded stuff like your claims here e.g. forcing RBS to walk out of Scotland. If you want to play dirty then you'll find we can reciprocate. I dare you to show me just one reputable claim where someone is arguing we won't take the debt when this wasn't in direct response to a similar threat from Westminster.

And there probably won't be a judge involved, just a bench of magistrates (the [majority of whom are over 60](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26359326) - and the kind of person who volunteers to be a magistrate).

If you don't plead guilty (which you are encouraged to do by the system at pretty much all stages) you're looking at being labelled an ""accused child abuser"" for months while the police and CPS process the case - during which time you won't be allowed to spend time with any children - or go to places where there might be children. Plus there's the reaction from your neighbours; you might just find yourself [killed by a mob](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/29/vigilante-murder-paedophile-bristol-bijan-ebrahimi).

If you have a large amount of money saved away to afford a lawyer (you probably won't be able to work during this time anyway due to the bail conditions) you might be able to fight the accusations. If you're lucky the CPS/police may drop the case eventually - but that won't remove the stigma attached to you. If you don't have a lawyer, you may find yourself pleading guilty (paying a small fine and registering on the sex offenders' list) just to get the situation over with.

And yes - this sort of thing does happen. But the current Government is going to fix it by allowing magistrates to sit on their own (not even as a bench) and issue convictions from police stations - so you'll be convicted much quicker. And they're taking away most of the legal aid that might be available, reducing your right to a free lawyer, and probably putting most of the criminal legal aid law firms out of business - all of which should speed things up as lawyers only get in the way and cost money.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt;  I think if we can be patient and really give Sherwood the time he deserves he will impress us.

What has Sherwood done to warrant being given time to prove he might be something as a manager?....his results are average, his tactics are poor and he seems to rely on asking his players to play with passion to get results. That may work with kids but it is a recipe for disaster the higher up you move in the world of football.

As for thinking that he could be a long term solution, there is nothing in the world of modern football that would support that idea.  Look at the management tenures of managers in England in the top 4 leagues (PL, Championship, League 1, League 2), these are the longest Tenured managers:

Arsene Wenger - Arsenal - 18 Seasons

Paul Tisdale - Exeter City - 8 Seasons

Mark Yates - Cheltenham Town - 5 Seasons

Russell Slade - Leyton Orient - 4 Seasons

Karl Robinson - MK Dons - 4 Seasons

Alan Pardew - NUFC - 4 Seasons

4 Seasons is considered ""long term"" now....

There is too much money in the game now, long term is not something that you can hope for in a manager. You can hope for a long-term solution in a club but managers will now come and go frequently. 

Problem is, even if a manager is unlikely to be around a club long term a bad performance can set a club back quickly.  Ask Villa about poor management choices they were a team that went from a team finishing 6th 3 straight times from 07/08 - 09/10 to a team that was in a relegation fight for consecutive seasons.  NUFC was in the CL in 02/03 and 03/04 and relegated in 08/09, then in 11/12 finish 5th before being 16th last season. Hell, even us, we finished 5th in 06/07 and in 08/09 we were in the relegation zone before Harry came aboard. It doesn't take much to slide down a couple slots and a couple slots is all it takes to negatively impact revenue, once revenue slips it becomes harder to maintain league position and just as hard to regain that position.

With 5 teams that can all outspend us and 5 or 6 teams that can out-coach Sherwood (Depending on where you rate Moyes and/or Martinez) now do we really want to gamble on a manger with no experience to maintain or improve our league position especially knowing that it is very simple to tumble.

LvG is a true world class manager who has had success everywhere he has ever manged. He may not get us CL, he is in no way a guarentee but he is a much better bet to do so than Tim. LvG's downside is likely still good enough to keep us status quo...Tim's downside is falling further down the table and increasing the gap between the have's and have nots and making it just that much harder close the gap.",0,1395688302,null,0,false,0,cgasard,t3_218fk9,t1_cgasard,t1_cgaolp3,null,1433048990,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

That would be extremely dangerous. If Scotland's currency was to gain value against the pound then they would be hit hard. It's normal to keep reserves in the currency which the account is administered to prevent this, banks do not take chances on these things and always shift the risk burden of currency exchange to the customer. 

&gt; it doesn't matter what it is, the yes campaign claims to have it if it's good, and be able to get rid of it if it's bad.

That's just plain wrong and a gross misinterpretation of how we got to this situation. We went into this expecting to have proportional share of everything, from the Bank of England to national assets right through to national debt. The expectation would be that assets (e.g. government buildings in London) would be ""sold"" off to England to offset the debt (and vice-versa), with the difference being owed at the end regardless of whether it's positive or negative. 

That's all we want, our fair share and you have no valid justification to deny any of it. You seem to forget that the crown, Bank of England etc are proportionally ours as well. The only group screaming for an unfair split is the ""no"" campaign.

Can you name one single official ""demand"" from the yes campaign that is genuinely unfair? Or are you basing your criticism on comments on youtube and reddit?

&gt;

&gt;__High Speed 2__ (HS2) is a planned   [high-speed railway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_the_United_Kingdom) between [London Euston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euston_Station), the [English Midlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Midlands), [North West England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England), Yorkshire, and potentially [North East England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England) and the [Central Belt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Belt) of [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland).

&gt;The project is being developed by __High Speed Two Ltd__, a [company limited by guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_limited_by_guarantee) established by the [UK government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_government). The line is to be built in two phases. The first phase will be between London and Birmingham, then the [second phase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_2_Phase_Two) to [Manchester Piccadilly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Piccadilly) running under [Crewe railway station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewe_railway_station) and via [Manchester Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport_railway_station), and to [Leeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_New_Lane_railway_station) via the [East Midlands Hub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands_Hub_railway_station) and [Sheffield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield) [Meadowhall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadowhall_Interchange). Four major city centres shall be served directly: London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. Other cities are to be accessed using HS2 trains running on existing tracks or with edge-of-town stations.

&gt;High-speed rail is officially supported in principle by the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, and opposed by [UKIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKIP) and the [Green Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales). A number of individual Labour and Conservative politicians do not support their party line, and oppose the HS2 scheme in detail; some reject the whole principle of high-speed rail. The [Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Ministry) formed in May 2010 stated in its initial programme for government its commitment to creating a high-speed rail network.  In January 2012, the construction of phase 1 between London and Birmingham was approved. Construction is set to begin in 2017 with an indicated opening date of 2026. In January 2013, the preliminary phase 2 route was announced with a planned completion date of 2032. The cost is estimated by the Department for Transport to be £43 billion; a study by the [Institute of Economic Affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Economic_Affairs) suggested a total cost of £80 billion. On English soil a comparable development is [HS1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_1).

With the current price at about $107.00 a barrel, Scotland may well be sending a bit more to London now than it gets back, which is very generous of our Scottish brethren.

But if the Scots are not contributing a ton load more now than they get back and I don't think they are, from 1982 to about 2006 Scotland was enjoying far more than it contributed and likewise from 2008 - 2010.

The Brent crude prices are here,

So that means that for more than 80% of the last generation the Scots have received much more scrappage than is fair.

And that's if the numbers are not as cooked as RBS' balance sheet was in 2006 because if things in Scotland are as rosy and resilient as the Nationalists say, why on earth don't they want their own currency?

Tim's style is too reactionary for a top 4 club.  Tim doesn't have a long term plan, there doesn't seem to be a style of play, or even a philosophy.  He reacts weekly to gut feeling and past performances.  His lineups feel less like he's planning for an opponent, and more like he's just trying to see what works.

I think that the coming years are crucial for Spurs.  The club is already on sound financial footing and the revenue is only going to get stronger with new sponsorships and increasing match day revenues with the new stadium.  I don't care that LVG might only spend 3-5 years with the club if it meant he left a sound foundation and improved player development program.

true,Morethanlikely,1986,Hasselbaink/Ramires,"Aw man, I really hate it when Luiz happens to be in the team when we have a great team performance. It always brings out the David Luiz fanatics.

As sole member of Team Ramires ^forever^and^ever I have to say that I definitively do not enjoy this idea of that Luiz is some sorts of godly CDM. He is incredibly uncomitted in it with a lot of mistakes and awful positioning. That Matic can ""cover"" those is not a good thing, Matic shouldn't need to be covering those to begin with.

Even looking at the game against Arsenal, BEFORE our goal he was the only reason Giroud had that amazing chance and we were lucky that Cech managed to pull off a great save. During other times of the game he was the only uncertainty(sp?) on the pitch with his chaotic movement and decisionmaking.

He isn't all bad though. He is stronger in the air than Ramires, but only because of his height. He is actually suprisingly poor at air duels considering his build. He also has better short passing and feels a bit more technical in that he can easily turn with a ball where as Ramires cannot and has to short pass his way out of it.

But then we come to the actual responsibilities without the ball. His position really is appalling and worst of all is how indecisive in it and his tackles. He has speed and pace but his indecisiveness kills the power the both have in combination with his chaotic nature. If he had better decisionmaking he could possibly be a much more interesting choice in the midfield.  For comparison look at Ramires' positioning in games. He *knows* where he can afford to move, taking his pace and max speed into account and moving accordingly. David Luiz does not make use of this at all so Matic has to cover for him a lot which means we don't see him pressing up. When he plays with Ramires he has a lot more free time further up the pitch.

Luiz' tackling reminds me of the old Ramires from 10/11, it's really like flipping a coin. Ramires has improved massively on it, and instead he is now the one getting tackled all the time, getting us plenty of free kicks along with Hazard.

And contrary to popular belief, scoring a couple of blooters last season doesn't make Luiz some constant threat against goal from a distance. Just want to put that out there.

I am very curious in hearing what all these David Luiz fans really see in him over Ramires because it never feels like they put out any sound arguments. IMO the only player that can dethrone Ramires from his place next to Matic is MvG should he blossom next season.",0,1395690956,null,0,false,0,cgatnp8,t3_218try,t1_cgatnp8,t3_218try,null,1433049631,-4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-4

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's the opposite way around! Using crude oil prices alone isn't an accurate measure of the percentage of taxation that come from Scotland compared to the rest of the UK as the price can stay the same in value but be worth a lot less in interest rates than than it was a year ago due to interests rates.

In the 70s and 80s Scotland MASSIVELY contributed more to the treasury than it got back. The 90s was still significantly more and now it has sort of slowed down.
There isn't a region of the UK that gives back more than it receives from the treasury but in proportion Scotland has had a smaller deficit/largest surplus than the rest of the UK for the last 30 years. (See GERS figures http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00418381.pdf).

Two years ago Scotland was generating 9.9% of UK taxation but receiving 9.3% back but last year for the first time ever it has fallen below that level (George Osborne enacted an 81% tax increase on north sea oil in time for the GERS figures to be released before the referendum - this isn't something that was discovered in hindsight; there was massive opposition at the time).

If Scotland was contributed the same percentage of tax intake as spending then there would have been about £60-65 billion extra over the last ten years.

The RBS references in this debate is sort of out of place as an independent Scotland would most likely have not needed to bail them out to the same extent as the UK and American governments would have (there liabilities and assets are almost 0% Scottish apart from 'headquarters' and offices). If they collapsed it would have been bad for people employed by them but would have a much smaller effect on the Scottish financial sector than the UK.

There were several Belgian banks bailed out by the French government for similar reasons.

The currency debate is quite interesting actually. I guess that it's a more popular option for the SNP to pursue and get them over the line but it does seem counter productive to go into a relationship on those terms. There is a huge proportion of nationalists who favour an independent currency.

If I vote yes then I will support a temporary usage of the pound (with or without currency union) while we establish our own central bank. That's actually a common view. ",0,1395691941,null,0,false,0,cgau5np,t3_217oul,t1_cgau5np,t1_cgasy84,null,1433049929,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Yes, I realise patient and professional fraud were mentioned. But seriously - unpaid prescription charges? The patient in reality is rarely the recipient of cash from the NHS or rarely pays into it directly (obviously some exceptions eg dental and prescription) but I wouldn't want to focus much effort there. It would be better spent reviewing whether prescriptions were required in the first place etc. I highly doubt this equates to anything like £7bn of fraud.

Yes, maybe there is some professional fraud. GP list sizes overstated. QoF indicators overstated (do they still do this?). But most of that is audited anyway to a degree. This links into the care homes comments.

Which leads us back to contractor fraud as the most likely high risk area for the NHS.

Their styles of showrunning are very different and in some ways opposite, and that accounts for some of the polarization you see.  People that really liked the RTD era have issues with Moffat's style, and vice versa.  Nothing about either showrunner makes their series unwatchable or disappointing, just different.

I tend to prefer the episodes from the RTD era simply because I found the characters to be better written and more compelling.  The stories from that era, though, were certainly hit-or-miss, with some absolute brilliant work (much of it written by Moffat, no less), but some absolute duds.

Moffat's era, on the other hand, does at least seem to be a little more consistent with story quality.  I've yet to see something of the caliber of Midnight or Blink, but then I haven't seen anything nearly as bad as Love and Monsters or Fear Her.  

I find his characterization to be somewhat flat, I'm really not impressed with the way he has turned the Doctor into an invincible superhero, and while I'm not going to jump on the Moffat-is-sexist bandwagon, I just don't think he's very good at writing female characters.  They're all basically the same character.  His story arcs are ambitious but perhaps a little too ambitious - I think his biggest problem is that he often tries to fit a two hour story into a 45 minute episode format and that often leaves some erratic plot development and occasionally disappointing or confusing last minute resolutions.

All that said, you should still watch and decide for yourself.  I tend to be critical of his character handling because I felt that was RTD's strength, but not everyone would see that as the most important element, and others favor the approach Moffat took to epic story telling.

The great thing about Doctor Who was that the show mirrored the Doctor himself. He was dark and brooding and damaged, but he spends time with curious and excited young people, and shows them all the wonders of the universe, to try and keep himself positive. But occasionally his outer shell slips, and you see the darkness of the world (and himself) underneath.

Although, I once took a trip from Philadelphia, PA to Washington DC on a fast train -- I cut a 2.25 hr drive-time into a little less than an hour via the rails.  The rail-car I was in was FULL of people on their daily commute.  I'm glad to hear that all of the debating has ultimately kicked up some progressive community involvement.  

All of those buildings look AMAZING!  We're not getting anything quite as modern as that.  However, we're starting to make use of some of our older buildings (old by our standards at least).  We had a movement called [Free The Hops](http://www.freethehops.org/) which made it possible to brew some descent beer.  Now we have 5 fantastic breweries -- all in older warehouses which were previously empty.  It's drastically changed the quality of life.  I think general domestic beers like Bud Light / Coors Light, etc, were dominating the landscape.  It's basically urine.  Waste of money.  

Also, we got [this beautiful stadium](http://aicontent.agentinsight.net/f/content/244/124f9343675f42e3bfc8326d8bd81f0d/600x450.jpg) to watch baseball games downtown (usually at sunset -- it's amazing).  They have rented out vendor spaces to some of the best restaurants in town, so you can go, eat a genuinely great meal, drink some local beers at an inflated price, and overall leave with a smile on your face.  

That music is all tremendous... I loved every one of those.  Here are a couple of bands doing cool things in Birmingham:

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"First off, I remember people hating RTD and Series 3/4/2009 Specials just as much as people seem to hate Moffat and Series 6/7/2013 Specials. It's more that the show has changed into something they like less than what it was before, so they want it to change into something different again.

The way I see it, if you're enjoying it, fuck what everyone else says. My two favorite seasons are Series 7 and Series 5. I feel S6 is too arc-based, but it's not bad by any means (probably my #4 after Series 1).

Most people's complaints about Moffat seem to boil down to ""too much arc/not enough standalones"" (series 5 &amp; 6), ""too much filler/not enough arc"" (series 7), the more ""fairytale"" depiction of the Doctor, ""thin""/poorly-developed characters, and the tendency to build up huge mysteries only to end up with an underwhelming explanation.

However, I disagree with all of those except for the ""too much arc"" complaint for Series 6. So, if you loved Series 5, I see no reason why you would dislike what's to come!

Now, since you're still working your way through, and I don't know how you're watching (Netflix, Amazon Instant, DVDs, etc.), BE SURE to watch Series 7 onward in the right order, which is:

1. Series 6
2. The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe (Xmas 2011)
3. Series 7, Part 1 (episodes 1-5, ""Asylum of the Daleks"" through ""Angels Take Manhattan"")
4. The Snowmen (Xmas 2012)
5. Series 7, Part 2 (episodes 6-13, ""Bells of Saint John"" through ""Name of the Doctor"")
6. The Day of the Doctor (50th Anniversary special)
7. The Time of the Doctor (Xmas 2013)

And then you'll be all caught up and ready for Series 8 later this year!

I felt the need to post that because Amazon Instant doesn't put ""Snowmen,"" ""Day"" or ""Time"" in the correct viewing order, they're in their own Specials section, and many torrents I've seen skip ""Snowmen,"" too. BE SURE TO WATCH ALL THE SPECIALS IN THE RIGHT ORDER! If you get confused, just go look at the [Wikipedia list of episodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctor_who_serials#Eleventh_Doctor) (things listed with a ""--"" instead of a story number are shorts that aren't necessary to watch).",0,1395694218,null,0,false,0,cgavcbj,t3_218drz,t1_cgavcbj,t3_218drz,null,1433050488,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

For example, season 4, on Netflix, has all the specials in order at the end of the list. So you'll be greeted with the episodes from season 4, then after the season finale, you'll find the specials.
Note: If you're planning on watching all the episodes up to season 7, just watch everything in order (season 1, season 2, season,3...etc.). I suggest that you don't watch the specials first because they can be quite confusing without backstory. Also, you'll probably not even notice that the episode was a special as some of them are key to the plot. If you're just planning on just watching the specials I have made two lists for you to watch.

Specials that do not need much backstory:

A Christmas Carol
Planet of the Dead
The Waters of Mars
The Runaway Bride

Specials that have something to do with the Doctor Who plot:

The Snowmen
The End of Time two-parter
The Day of The Doctor
The Time of The Doctor

true,General_Beauregard,null,null,"I don't necessarily think Luiz is better than Ramires because they are completely different players, but I do think Luiz is already a good CDM with potential to be great. Yes, Ramires has incredible endurance and pace, which can be an asset both defending and getting up the field quickly on counter attacks, but he does not have nearly the same distribution skills as Luiz.

I'm going to focus on counter attacking, since that is our favored method of attack. When Ramires wins the ball looking to counter, his best option is to carry the ball forward at pace. If/when he runs into defenders, he almost always looks for a short pass, usually one of the attacking three checking back. At this point, the opposing defense has had time to recover behind the ball.

In comparison, when Luiz wins the ball and looks to counter, his first option is usually a long diagonal or at least quickly finding the feet of one of the attacking three. My point is that, yes, Ramires can attack with the ball directly, but when our best mode of attack is countering at pace, there is nothing faster nor more incisive than playing the ball forward directly.

Defensively, I agree that Luiz has room to improve, but I don't think its fair to call him any more of a liability than Ramires, considering Ramires has the worst discipline record in the PL right now. He is going to improve with playing time, and I think he has a much higher ceiling than Ramires.

In my opinion, Ramires was most dangerous when we employed him as a winger but with some defensive responsibility. Unfortunately for him, with the current form of Hazard, Willian, Oscar, and Schurrle (including getting back to defend), I don't see Mourinho using him in that role any time soon.

A levels are getting easier, so students arrive ill-prepared for university.. so to make it more manageable for them, they get less material in their first year.. which in turn leaves less material in the second year, etc etc. It completely devalues the degrees of those who got them only a few years before because they keep making everything too damn easy.

&gt;__Owain ap Gruffydd__ (""Owain son of Gruffydd""; c. 1080 – 28 November 1170) was [King of Gwynedd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Gwynedd) in Northern [Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_in_the_High_Middle_Ages) from 1137 until his death in 1170. He was the first to be styled ""[Prince of Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales)"".  He is considered to be the most successful of all the North Welsh princes prior to his grandson, [Llywelyn the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great). He became known as __Owain Gwynedd__ ([Middle Welsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Welsh_language): *Owain Gwyned*, ""Owain of Gwynedd"") to distinguish him from the contemporary [king](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Powys) of [southern Powys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Powys_Wenwynwyn) [Owain ap Gruffydd ap Maredudd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owain_Cyfeiliog), who became known as ""Owain Cyfeiliog"". Owain Gwynedd was a member of the [House of Aberffraw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Aberffraw), the senior branch of the dynasty of [Rhodri the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodri_the_Great).

It's very easy for them to sack you (lack of sales? Dismissed.) and there's a high turnover of staff and low morale. You're essentially warm (a.k.a. cold) calling customers to try and sell them a contract phone. You might also be selling business mobile packages to businesses, and this is a fair bit harder in my experience. I just dislike working in call-centres in general, and I would heavily recommend holding out for something else, but whether that's an option for you is of course something else entirely.

There are new starters every week and you're often thrown into the deep end with a lot of pressure mounted on you. If you're good at sales then that's fine, but if you're not (and quite a few people are pushy enough to be truly good at them I find) then you'll struggle to hit commission which is really when a decent paycheck comes out.

Also you'll often lie to customers. Your script (must make 5 script calls a day and disposition them on the system as such~) will read something like:

Hi, my name's X and I'm calling from Unicom regarding your O2 contract, how are you today?

When really apart from those 5 deals you'll be slyly encouraged to say:

Hi it's just a quick call regarding your O2 contract.

Or

Hi, I'm calling on behalf of O2 regarding your mobile phone contract, how are you today?

Besides, the only real way this affects unemployment is that the state is (via some contractor most likely) employing people to administer these courses, with all the Keynesian knock-on effects that has. 

If you train people in these otherwise-useless jobseeking skills, all you're really doing is teaching them to get a job that some other jobseeker would have had anyways. It's a zero-sum exercise as far as unemployment is concerned - state-subsidised make-work.

It's different from teaching unemployed people actual job skills - if done well, that can increase employment by attracting employers, cutting skill shortages or creating self-employment.

Make sure you do the sums in relation to the mortgage payments and the ""profit"" you make as only the interest portion of a monthly repayment mortgage is tax deductible so you'll pay income tax on the repayment part at the highest rate of tax you pay.

For example:

* Rental income £6000 p.a

* Mortgage payments: £4000 pa of which £2000 is interest and £2000 capital.

* Other costs £500pa.

Total taxable expenses, £2500 as the capital portion of the mortgage is not tax deductible.

Profit for tax = £6000 - £2500 = £3500.

Income tax due @ 20% = £700 which is almost half of what you actually have in your pocket if you're on a repayment mortgage. If you're a 40% tax payer the tax bill will be basically all the income after the mortgage and other expenses.

I see cyclists break the law **to a reckless degree** way more often. Blowing through red lights, stop signs and not giving appropriate signals.

That said, When you're on the bike a lot your perception could easily get skewed. When you're on the bike you are moving slower and so you'll not see as many cyclists on the road. You'll also see motorists do a different type of stupid act when they underestimate your speed. I often get cars pulling out infront of me when i **know** they can see me. They just don't expect a bike to be doing 20-25mph.

true,rhinoseverywhere,null,null,"I've been thinking about this all day.

The problem is that, if we want more than 1 season of success, we either need to keep Suarez or manage to stay in the champions league long enough that we can attract more top talent and challenge for the league in the future.

Regardless of how the end of the season goes, I think that our play so far means that we have a better chance at keeping Suarez than anyone would have believed at the start of the season. That said, if we want to keep him, we need to make him think that life at Liverpool will be as good as life at one of the very best clubs in the world. I don't mean Arsenal right now, I mean Bayern, Barca, and Real. To do that, we need to make him believe that Liverpool will be challenging for the league next year, and the best way to do that would be to win it. In that sense, a Manchester City loss would be the best.

On the other hand, if Manchester United win and we end up losing Suarez anyway because we don't win the title / some other team makes him an offer we can't refuse (which is very possible, considering Henry's screw up of saying something that can be interpreted as saying that we're willing to ignore contracts, which won't help our case next time teams come calling for Suarez), having Manchester United win could be terrible for us.

Even after just two wins a row, all of the press has already started saying that there is ""renewed optimism"" at United. Imagine if they were to win against City? They might be able to end the season on a positive note, have a great transfer period, and compete again next season. Having 6 legitimate top 4 contenders is awfully dangerous if you're not guaranteed to be at the very top of the group, which we wouldn't be without Suarez. Seeing United get dangerous again could lead to long term problems.

To add another layer of complexity, a win now could keep Moyes in for another year. Personally, I don't believe he has the strength of personality to coach at the very highest level, so having him stay on for another year or so could completely counteract the effects of a good transfer period. That said, you never know how he'll evolve as a manager as he learns more about managing a top tier squad, so maybe keeping him on could prove to be the right decision for United in the long run.

What does this all mean? At the end of the day, I think I'm puling for a United win. This season has been completely insane, and having the opportunity to really cheer for a title at the end of the season would be one of the most exciting things I can imagine. Long term considerations are so complicated to untangle that I decided I wasn't going to bother with that and just think about this season.

That's pretty much socialism, but yeah, mutualism is supportive of that.

&gt;There would still be money and wages and people would sell the products of their labour to each other... Is that in the neighbourhood? 

Not so much - there are some who are more well-disposed to those things, but many of us would see such things as money and employer-employee relations as capitalist and therefore repudiate them.  Labour notes and worker directed enterprises would be preferred...  But the core of mutualism is reciprocity and the golden rule.

Sure - I've always considered myself radical left, but not quite as radical as some.

Like somebody mentioned earlier, as a country we now have to make a joke about paedophilia in the most opportune circumstances, whether the circumstances are awkward or not.

I worked in a theme park in my late teens and naturally made small talk with the parents while their kid was on one of our rides. In this particular instance I was working in a place called something along the lines of ""Toy Town"" so it was a kids-only sort of section of the park. I heard many a crude line from the fathers of the children that went something like this -

""God, you must feel like Michael Jackson working in this place all day mate, uhuhuhuhuhuh!""

I mean, yeah, you'd think that one guy might come up with that sort of, uh, ""joke"" once, but I heard it all the time. Yeah, I suppose it made me chuckle a bit the first time, but the whole *puts on scary voice* peeedophiiile hysteria is instilled into peoples brains, at least in this country. Okay, sure, they were trying to make small talk, but can't you just spend on day at a theme park with your family without referencing that sort of thing? It makes you wonder.

Another story... I remember being with a female friend a few years back at her house. She's 17. We were having a discussion with her uneducated friend who preferred Burberry baseball caps. She explained that, a few nights ago, some creepy guy was getting a little too close to her in the pub and being a bit, well, touchy. Her friend's response was -

""VATS A PEDAFILE VAT IS! DO U NO WHERE HE LIVES.""

Vat, my friend, is not a paedophile. You're a fucking idiot drowning in the pool of shit that the media is. I couldn't even comprehend the level of intelligence this young man had succumb to.
