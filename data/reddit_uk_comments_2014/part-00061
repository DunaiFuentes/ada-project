3. Yes, a modern take is nice. 

4. Yes, now they've been reintroduced. With the Zygon's interaction  with the assistant in the 50th. I wonder what they plan for them, maybe they would act the same towards the Doctor and bring out his ""dark"" side in season 8. 

5. No, maybe...they're overdone but they're classic. 

6. Maybe, but unlikely. 

7. Origins yes but I don't want to see them again. My reason being that they can't be more than time-locked beings. Someone prisoned in their state. Maybe they're aliens the Time Lords exiled to this form?

8. Eh they're not villains per se. They're neutral mercenaries usually hired by the Shadow Proclamation as a police. Unless someone hires them for evil-doing, I don't think we'll see them as villains. 

9. 1. We've got enough new ones for now, I want to see new takes on old enemies.

The villains I want to see in this order: 1. Vasha Nerada 2. Valeyard 3. The Master 4. Ice Warriors 5. Zygons 6. Time Lords (if they start leaning towards to bad stuff)

7 &amp; 8. Silurians and Sontarans. I had a thought about this. It really think it would give the Paternoster Gang good character development. 

 - With the Silurians, the episode could be about Vastra meeting her sisters again, revealed an earlier contact between humans and Silurians, how her sisters are against her relationship with Jenny cause she's human.

You see where I'm going with this. People are killed by all kinds of things that you can prevent but once again the MOTORIST is an easy target. Just like the congestion charge was.

It's quite sad that the motorist is the target of every new scheme to make us ""green"" these days.

That's not great either.

Aguero to come on around the 60th min aswell as Garcia and Lopez later in the game.

We'll start with a strong line up. I think because Pellegrini will have his trophy target in mind plus moral for the rest of the season. 

I'm hoping for a comfortable win but 3-2 springs to mind in our favour, tough match. Enjoy tomorrow lads.

true,LongDongShagswell,null,null,"This is an awesome analysis.  Even though it makes me look like a dumbass, it still gets an upvote.

I really get the impression that Torres is trying to mold himself into a more creative forward.  Evidently, it's not working. The Torres of old specialized in beating the offside trap and heading home crosses, but that requires strength and speed he doesn't have anymore.  Instead, he's opting to play more creatively.  His creativity is not developed, as you can tell.  However, his passing hasn't been that bad.  There are times, albeit few times, where his movement is good too.

 [I found a video from the game against Hull at the beginning of the season demonstrating some of his better plays.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x14mly2_fernando-torres-movement-vs-hull-city-2013_sport) 

However, his runs are back into the midfield, sometimes very deep, instead of forward, like a sort of false nine.

This seems like it's dependent on the central midfielder(s) overlapping with Torres.  If Oscar or Lampard or whoever doesn't make a forward run, he will be stepping on their toes.  Perhaps this is why he opts to move left or right.  Maybe it's his way of opening up space for the inverted winger because he is so reluctant to make a run himself.",0,1393737616,null,0,false,0,cfs8sjd,t3_1z9p6q,t1_cfs8sjd,t1_cfs6a8p,null,1432620869,18,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,18

 I grew up watching power puff girls never once thinking of target audiences, I also watched it with my little brother from the time he could talk until he was like 10, then we moved onto shows like Xiaolin Showdown, numerous friends, some even close, identify as bronies.

But this film doesn't do anything to defend the notion of the brony or even give insight, it just stays true to its nature and documents it, and then showcases an experience between a skeptical parent and a parent who is excepting at a brony convention.

the dynamics of being a brony do not add up in any mentally healthy way from my observation, I view it as a sensation similar to juggalo's, to me juggalos are people who seek a sense of belonging who most likely grew up in environments that where unstable or off kilter, so they flock together and feed into the comradery-like sensation of being a juggulo, having a family, embracing a new identity because their previous existence was meek compared to the green-grassed field that the juggalo philosophy showcases.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"I think it's marvellous that you make a charitable donation of approximately 10 hours of your life every week to your employer.  Some people choose to volunteer at a soup kitchen, others set up a direct debit to Oxfam, but you've elected to work for free for what I assume is a profit-making company.  I'm sure they're delighted and are happy to nonchalantly turn a blind eye to the stipulations of the legally binding contract you hold with them which clearly states your expected attendance at work in exchange for an appropriate remuneration.

It is worth considering, however, to what extent that would be reciprocated by your employers if it were the other way round.  Let's say, for instance, that you decided you needed some free time; that you'd been working too hard and wanted to wind down a little.  So you approach your employer and explain that, for the next couple of months, you're going to be only working 20 hours a week, but will still expect to be paid your full salary.  Do you think they would be happy with that arrangement or might they start pointing at that contract you have with them and harrumphing about broken promises and failure to meet expectations?

You have a strong work ethic and that's a good thing, but what you're doing is ultimately harmful.  It sets you up as someone who'll give them something for nothing.  Yes, you may achieve a promotion, but no doubt you'll still be expected to give them your time for nothing.  Others will then be expected to do the same and, before you know it, we reach a point where it's considered normal to donate additional hours to a company for no remuneration whatsoever, whilst they make a profit off the back of it.  Some people might call that idiotic.

Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm not seeing the bigger picture.  But I'm fairly certain that, as sure as eggs is eggs, such employers will not show the same loyalty to you as you're showing to them.  As soon as you're in a position that you're no longer donating free hours, you are worth less to them and they'll start looking around for someone else who'll work extra hours at no cost.

true,TastyBrainMeats,null,null,"&gt;Ughhh.  I consider myself to be a generally progressive, accepting person.  But bronies are fucking weird.

&gt;Doctor Who:  A long running tv show, without any specific target demographic, with themes ranging from family friendly to moderately adult (to very adult if you expand out to Torchwood).  Fanbase consists of geeky adults, college students, their professors, and older children.  Basically everyone.

Didn't Doctor Who start out as a kids' show? Isn't it still viewed as such by those making it?

&gt;
MLP:  A cartoon, targeted at little girls, with themes that reflect the interests and attention span of said target audience.  Fanbase consists of little girls (the target audience), and for whatever reason, adult males, many of which literally jack off to the show.

Buddy, you're letting your preexisting bias color your perceptions pretty strongly there. Do a quick search for the name ""Lauren Faust""; she brought a lot of interest into the show from older fans of her previous work, as well as fans of Genndy Tartakovsky and her husband, Craig McCracken. That's the starting nucleus of the ""brony"" group right there.

And you know what? I'm an adult man and I spent most of my life scared away from anything ""girly"". I actively avoided anything pink or purple or frilly. Plenty of GI Joes as a kid, lots and lots of violence, never anything about cooperation or tolerance once I outgrew the Care Bears.

You know how the episode is centred on the fact that the universe is stuck in time and it's collapsing onto itself. Then we get to the top of the pyramid and we see a machine that is broadcasting a signal to all of space and time asking for help to save the doctor. 
What if that collapse of time caused the cracks in the universe and the machine asking for help is what the current universe heard coming from Trenzalore which caused them to rush to that place. They proclaimed to go and help when instead they want to get rid of him. It also doesn't hurt that both episodes involve the silence and the death of the doctor.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; The title is a bit misleading too. If I put £10 in a machine and keep playing until it's all gone, I've only spent £10, but I will have staked say £100 or so.

In a casino your £10 is described as the drop.  The article does use that term, though it doesn't describe its significance.

&gt;About £2.5bn was dropped into the machines in the poorest boroughs, the campaign group's report suggests

That starts to cut into your headline a bit though, because if we use that the big, scary number is cut down to a fifth.

It gets even worse because we can use the numbers in the next paragraph to get an idea of the amount retained by the machine operators.  That suggests it's a smidgeon under 20%, so we'll round up to 20% to accommodate my laziness.

£2.5bn goes into the machines.  80% gets recycled out to gamblers.  The machine operators withhold 20%, which comes out as £500m.  *(Still a comprehensively terrifying amount of money.)*

It's around-about one eighth of HMRC's annual budget, although HMRC will take 15% as tax.

Still, multiplying out the real loss by x 26 makes for a nice headline, eh?

true,ThatIckyGuy,capaldi,Capaldi,"To be honest, I was only talking about Looney Tunes. Times were different when those cartoons were made and often they were made to come before movies because going to the theater was a thing to do and you give your audience their money's worth by showing a cartoon before the main feature. One of those being Looney Tunes. I wasn't really even touching on any other cartoons. Pixar aims for both parents and kids, too. I'm a big fan of Pixar, by the way. I have no children of my own, but the first few movies came out when I was a wee lad.


&gt; ...and ironically, Lauren Faust said that while MLP was targetted at young girls, she wanted to make it so adults could enjoy it too. She wanted parents to want to watch the show with their children.

Yes, but there's a difference between liking and worshiping. The latter being one of the many reasons I stopped giving a crap about the show.

&gt; In a lot of ways, the new MLP is an enjoyable show burdened by it's 80's super-gender bias version and namesake.

Right, but without the original, you wouldn't have FiM. Faust grew up on the originals herself and most of what she put into the series were how she played with the toys in her youth. Bronies are quick to throw G1 under the bus, but you really shouldn't.

Incidentally, I wouldn't have even bothered with FiM had it not been for the original myself. I had some nostalgia regarding the series. Having an older sister, I was forced to watch the G1 movie (very late 80s/early 90s) at the babysitter's house because that's what my sister liked.

Looking at the situation in Europe today, Trident is the only reason we can be quite reassured that any conflict in Ukraine wouldn't escalate to WW3.  Russia can't afford to directly confront the West and we can't directly confront Russia.

Like it or not, Trident (and the concept on MAD) is the only thing that kept the cold war cold and going forward, ensures that no one can seriously threaten the UK.  Today, there are only a handful of country that may pose a significant threat, but who's to say that won't change quickly?

I could cite present defence cuts to highlight the problem.  The rationale given initially was they the UK was unlikely to be involved in a significant conflict any time soon.  Suddenly the Arab Spring happens.  Hell breaks loose across North Africa and we can't make any significant interventions even if we want to - just to be able to bomb Gaddafi we needed to get bases in Italy.  Now, trouble's extended to Europe's doorstep with a potential war brewing and again, we're caught off guard because we thought there weren't going to be any major conflicts.  With a population of almost 50 million, Europe can't afford the Ukraine to end up in some Syria-esque situation.

The only reason the situation is at all tenable, is that we can look to US for protection.  The only reason we may be able to do without Trident is that the US has it.  As the only super power it can enforce the ""Pax Americana"" over our corner of the world, but I think we should be able to stand on our own, or at least bring something useful to the table if needs be.

true,Jimmni,null,null,"Here is the letter I sent my MP shortly after Christmas. I've redacted certain details to vaguely protect the anonymity of my reddit account.

&gt;I am writing to you regarding the situation I have been left in by the DWP over the Christmas period.

&gt;For eight years I was [previous job redacted], but was forced to stop working as a [redacted] after a significant worsening of my psoriatic arthritis. I relocated from [redacted] back to [redacted] in order to be closer to family and friends. My illness was extremely disabling for many months, but over the past year has been improving, and I have been actively seeking work.

&gt;During October and November I was given the opportunity to do a few hours a week of administration work. This work was to be completed on a self-employed basis, but it seemed to me a great idea in order to fill a gap on my CV and to get me a second reference - something I sorely needed in order to have a better chance at making successful applications to jobs.

&gt;I naturally declared this work to the Job Centre every two weeks when I signed on. It was work I could easily have not declared - nobody would know if I did the work, took the money, and told nobody. But I am honest and in all my time unemployed I’ve never sought to gain a penny more than I felt I needed. I never even claimed disability allowance even when I was most likely eligible, as I knew my condition was improving.

&gt;I repeatedly asked the Job Centre advisors, in person and over the telephone, what I should be doing regarding declaring the work I was doing, and I was given forms to fill in, which I filled in. Towards the end of November I arranged to let a flat - finally gaining some measure of independence again after being forced to completely rely on family and friends during my illness. As they processed my claim for housing benefit, the council noted that my JSA claim had been stopped as of 5th December. This was the first time I had been informed of this, and I had signed on a couple of days before.

&gt;After contacting the DWP to enquire as to why my claim had been stopped, I eventually discovered that they needed me to fill in a new - different and previously unmentioned - form. They told me to arrange an appointment with my advisor to go through it. My advisor, when contacted, sent me a form to fill in, but it was unprintable due to security protections. After much additional time on the phone, I eventually got through to someone who was able to post me the correct form. Several days later this form arrived and I duly filled it in, attaching a copy of my accounts.

&gt;I had simply been offered some very part time work and rather than do nothing I thought I’d do it. It was never going to improve my situation financially, but I hoped it would improve my motivation, self-respect, and prospects for full-time employment.

&gt;It is now the 6th January, a full month after my claim was stopped. The DWP has left me penniless over the Christmas period. I’ve had to rely entirely on friends and family to feed myself during this time. The DWP say it could be as much as another two weeks before my claim is assessed.

&gt;I did a few hours of work and was honest and declared it and because of that I have been left destitute over the Christmas period. When asked, the DWP couldn’t even provide me with advice on soup kitchens to visit. I am lucky in that I have family to I can turn to, but if I did not have that luxury I would have been left for the past month with no way to heat my flat, no way to pay my rent (which is still due) and no way to feed myself.

&gt;How can this be just? I am not a benefit cheat, and I am not someone who has never worked a day in my life and who is shunning work now. I am being punished for trying to improve my situation and honestly declaring the few hours of work I was able to find. I understand it has been Christmas and the New Year and there have been a number of bank holidays, but I still need to eat, even on bank holidays.

My (Tory) MP didn't reply. They re-started my benefits towards the end of January, but reduced my payments by about £12 a week, a reduction which is still in place when I do not have any work (it isn't every week).

Fuck them all, to be honest. Fuck them all.

Edit: They did restart my claim (at the reduced rate) so my motivation to keep sending letters was reduced. What I took away from the whole thing, more than anything, was this: If you are on benefits, either get a full time job or do NOTHING. I've kept doing whatever work I can as it helps ME feel better and helps my CV, but being honest royally screwed me. I can absolutely see why so many people commit benefit fraud. It's just so punishing when you don't.

There's little else to the article, so I can understand why it's all people are picking up from it.

The criminal population of the UK is predominately male, and since that's the case then it's perfectly reasonable to assume that criminals will encourage other people to become criminals. I don't see people standing up for male criminals saying it was someone else who got them involved in crime, why does being female matter there? I imagine most criminals did get involved through someone else, but that doesn't turn them from criminals to victims - although I'm sure most criminals are victims in one way or another.

I understand resurrecting United would be a task that would gain recognition for any manager, but taking quick and technical young Spurs to a title run would be a task more suited to Van Gaal as opposed to rejuvenating an ageing team.",0,1393762115,null,0,false,0,cfsdsoz,t3_1z9ox7,t1_cfsdsoz,t1_cfs5uw1,null,1432623292,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

&gt;In recent years, roadsigns to the village have been altered by the method of 'crossing' the first 'l' in 'shilbottle' to make it appear as a 't' on roadsigns, thus making it read as an obscenity. Although signs have been restored and replaced over the years, this continues to be a problem. Comedian [Stewart Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Lee) made reference to this in the first episode of the third series of ""[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Lee%27s_Comedy_Vehicle)"", claiming it as a marker of the human creative spirit - in decline due to the rise of the internet.

Depending on how it is done, it can be intended to move the story forward when the writer has ""painted themself into a corner"" and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [happy ending](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_ending), or as a comedic device.

I personally often found older papers easier than the ones I was doing.  I remember when I was teaching, some things from my Further Pure modules (Further Maths) had been shifted back into the Core Modules (the modules in Maths A-level that cover Pure).  I would say that the newer exams were in general easier to *pass*, in that there are more elements to each question, and it's easier to pick up a few marks here and there to add up to a low grade, but to get a high grade you still need to be able to tackle the big mark earners at the end of each question, and I'm of the opinion these are no easier material-wise.  In short the exams are easier in that they are less failable, rather than easier to achieve an A on, when looking at material alone.

true,TIBBLESUK,null,null,"I personally don't think it will be a defined kitty. I believe they will have in Rodgers to buy where he needs. When you have goals in the team it's a lot easier to invest. There isn't many goal scorers out there and they cost a lot.

But I feel Johnson will be sold if he doesn't sign at a lower value than he is asking for. Meaning we will need a right back, Left Back, a defensive midfielder and a goal scoring winger/attacking midfielder. All of which have some good value options available. 

At left back there is Contrao, Criscito felipe luis, Schmelzer and Zuniga. I feel we could pick one if those up for around £10-£12m.

At right back there is Maggio, Coleman, Richards and Shaw who would all be a bit pricier at £13-£20m.

Defensive midfield I feel we could go for Alex Song, Khedira, M'Villa, Gustavo at around £15m

Attacking midfield options are Koke, Shaqiri, Lallana, Hamsik, Hulk, one of those Ukrainian dudes, Banega, Pastore. A bit more ambitious but looking at around the £20-£30m mark.

Then letting us buy one good value striker player like a Danny Ings or Tom Ince for around the £7m price.

Leaving a spend of around £75m, knock of around £25-£30mil from the sale of players like Borini, Johnson, Kolo, Reina, Assiaidi.  Leaving an investment of around the £45-£50mil mark. Not a crazy figure.

Our team could look like 

Gk: Mingolet

RB: Shaw/Flanno

CB: Agger/Skrtel/Sahko/Ilori/Kelly

LB: Felipe Luis/Enrique 

DM: Khedira/Lucas

CM: Gerrard/Suso/Hendo/Allen

AM/Wingers: Coutinho/Sterling/Hamsik/Alberto/Ibe

Strikers: Suarez/Studge/Aspas/Ings

I personally feel that's a competitive squad to compete in all competitions and isn't a complete pipe dream. We would have to invest around £50-£60mil. My transfers were suggestions and we shouldn't put our eggs in one basket and get good value with each buy.

MORE than 90 youngsters enjoyed Aston Villa's latest half-term Soccer School at Arthur Terry School last week.

The eager children were visited by three of Villa's under-21 squad – Graham Burke, Callum Robinson and Josh Webb, who were fresh from their 4-2 victory against Blackburn Rovers.

Throughout the week the children worked on a range of different techniques including shooting, passing, turning, crossing, goalkeeping and the role of the striker.

Villa will be running an Easter Soccer School at Arthur Terry from April 22-25 (Tuesday to Friday).

The cost for mini-kickers (4-6 years old) is £20 and juniors (7-14-years old) £40. For more details or to book a place for a child call 0800 612 0970 or go online at www.avfc.co.uk/soccerschools

true,MrPatch,null,null,"My two biggest concerns about a grammar system would be that anyone not getting into a grammar school would be seen as less intelligent. If you could somehow remove the stigma associated with going to a technical school (or what ever the other options were) then you don't have the mad clamour of the 11+ with parents going mental trying to get their kids into a school that, ultimately, might not suit them.

The second is one of segregation. I think what /u/verygneiss said about still being able to socialise across ability groups in a streamed school is excellent. As a learning experience in itself children learn that people of other classes/abilities/social backgrounds/culture are all equally capable of being nice/arseholes, and I think thats incredibly valuable to take forward into adulthood. 

In the end I see that the only real way of negating those two issues is with the streaming system that we already have in place in comprehensives (my experience is circa 1996 so I may be out of date). You could argue that perhaps you stream students earlier and in a more agressive manner, completely segregating the tier 1 students from tier 2 and 3 (or whatever), but thats kind of what we did anyway. To go any further than that you would need separate buildings (so back to grammar/technical college split)

In the end I don't see any real benefit of completely physically and educationally segregating students by ability at age 11.

Short term: target the absolute minimum that you *need* to live and live that way for a few months, then once you have your spending under control you can re-evaluate and get yourself into a ""comfortable"" budget, doesn't need stating but... it's far better to miss out on some niceties/luxuries for a few months than it is to run out of money.

If you consider that you have to spend around £1750 per month on a nanny so that you can work and £250 per month on professional costs it looks like your *effective* take home is closer to £5,000, on that take home it might be wise to reduce your mortgage overpayments until you can either increase your take home: when do your children start school? do you have any opportunities to increase your salary?

BTW I completely disagree with the idea that you should cutback on your pension contributions, especially when you don't have **any** other retirement savings and you appear to be on an interest only mortgage.

What probably happened with you is that the MP just forwarded it on to the DWP, who will add it to their pile, and will write back (probably with a generic letter) once they've had a look at it. And then your MP will write back to you - probably again with a fairly generic letter.

But that's single-seat constituency first-past-the-post voting for you; you have a good chance of ending up with a representative who doesn't care about you.

If you want to kick up a fuss you could try looking for more sympathetic local representatives, or EU-level representatives. Particularly if one of them is likely to be challenging your current MP in 2015.

That said, there's not much your MP or any representative can (or is going to) do. The DWP are probably buried under these sorts of cases and having MPs writing to them probably isn't going to help.

Around this time last year my mother-in-law gave us her old freezer and washing machine as she'd had a bit of windfall and replaced a lot of her kitchen stuff.  I left our old one outside the front door whilst getting the 'new' one plugged in and filled with food, with the intention of listing the old one on the local 'free stuff' facebook group.  However, in the time it took me to re-fill the new freezer our old one had disappeared.  

A couple of days later it was sitting outside one of the pop-up second hand shops with a £50 sticker on it.... I got a earful of abuse and threats from the shop keeper when I asked why he thought it was OK to take something from private property without asking.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"There are three EL spots for Premier League clubs. The first is for the team finishing 5th in the league. The second is for the winners of the League Cup and the third is for the winners of the FA cup. Should either cup winners have already qualified for europe via other means, the spot is given to the highest finishing team that didn't qualify. Assuming City finish in the top 5, then the 6th place team would get a European spot. The FA cup is different, runners up are given the last spot in the EL if the winners are already in europe. If both teams have already qualified, then the 7th place team would get a EL spot. This season we should hope that Man City beat Arsenal in the final.

There are also places available for fair-play. I believe the top 3 FP leagues get a spot each and the next few leagues get entered into a draw and some of them get a FP spot. Leagues that win a FP entry into the EL usually give it to the highest ranked team that hadn't qualified. Those teams have to play an extra qualifying round, or two.

I remember watching the Womens UEFA U21 competition, or something like that, on Martin Jol's first season because they were going to do the draw at HT and Spurs had qualified for that draw. Sadly we didn't get in that season but we qualified for Europe the next season. The fans were so excited to finally be back in Europe, now we act like it's a massive chore and we're beneath it.

As for the subject in hand, I've mentioned before on here how often I come across people who have no gas or electric for weeks at a time.  I work for a company who do gas safety checks and repairs for several very large housing associations, it's becoming more and more common for engineers to return jobs with 'Unable to service, tenant has no gas/electric to test'.  I've got residents who we capped off in December who still haven't called us to come out and uncap, which means they've had no heating or hot water for 3 months.  I find that a lot of people have to choose between gas or electric - since they can't even keep food fresh without electric, they sacrifice the gas and boil kettles to wash with.

true,King_Dumb,null,null,"Personally I say yes they should. You just have to look at the only country within the union which still has a significant Grammar School system, Northern Ireland. Almost every year in and year out, NI has outperformed Great Britain in GCSE and A level results. Granted there will be other factors which lead to that however it is something worth noting. I also think they are fairer way of giving out school places, more on this later.

It's a bit of a myth that you only had one chance of getting into a Grammar School when you were 11. There was the 13+ exam for children who showed potential after they had developed and matured a little bit more. People were also moved ""down"" from Grammar Schools if they were not coping. People who went to Grammar’s were expected to take O levels but some people did do CSEs. Similarly people who went to the Modern’s and were good enough took the O levels instead of the CSEs. Some would say this is a two tier education system and that’s why the comprehensive system is superior. The only problem is, is that today GSCEs have two tiers: Higher and Lower. From what I can remember (been six years) for Lower tier it is easier to get a C grade, compared to Higher, but you are limited to a C.

I'm glad you raised the point of technical schools. The main failings of the Grammar School system was that it wasn't supposed to be a two stream system, but a three stream system called the [Tripartite system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_system_of_education_in_England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland). Within the Tripartite system you had the Grammar's, Modern's, plus Technical schools. They were (the Technical’s) designed to teach mechanical, scientific and engineering skills required by industry.


However there was very few Technical Schools as: the Trade Unions felt that technical education was their responsibility, Teachers with the required skills were in a limited supply, and they were viewed as second best. Arguable the idea was the have Grammar’s for people who were more bookish, Modern’s for people who learnt more hands on, and the Technical’s for people who were a bit of both. As you can see the system doesn’t work if you only have the extremes.


For the point that the Grammar System was fairer compered to today, at least it is based somewhat on ability. Another argument for the Comprehensive system is that the middle and upper classes used to have tutors teach their children for the 11+ so the Grammar School system is based on the parent’s wealth. I think this argument can be used more against the Comprehensive system than for it. Good Secondary schools increased the house prices within its catchment area, this is due to people wanting their children go to a good school. The more money you have the closer to a good school you can get to, the more homogenised the school community becomes. At least under the Tripartite system if you were poor as a church mouse your child had a shot of going to a school which is not only good but opens their eyes to how the other half lives. Coupled with student grants your child has a chance of going to a well-respected university.


**TLDR: Introduce Technical’s. Bring back Grammar’s. Comprehensive system is unfair. Bring back Student Grants.**

Very low incomes, zero hour contracts, temporary agency work - all of these things are absolutely crippling people financially.  I genuinely believe that the living wage would benefit the economy, but I don't know many SME's (who make up the bulk of employers where I live, at least) who are in a position to offer it. 

That being said, I don't see the point of a minimum wage if it has to be propped up by tax credits and housing benefit.

Schools become good when parents expect high standards and get involved in pressing for improvement. Grammar schools benefit from this, with mostly middle-class, articulate parents making their presence known. Not (generally) true of Sec Mods.

I'm not sure if you've been watching him at Everton, but the problem he has is that he's either brilliant or quite poor. He can show insane skill, score beautiful goals or continually give away the ball and cause problems for the other Everton players, but obviously that will improve with more playing time. 

With Pienaar getting older there is definitely a place in our squad for another winger, and Deulofeu's role will most likely become bigger the more he improves.

Try to find ~~his home address or~~ the address of his office (not just the standard ""Send to your MP"" address) and send letters detailing your case to prominent local activists and opposition parties. I'm sure Tory critics would jump at the chance to highlight your plight. Write to your local paper. Write to a national paper - write to a specific journalist (or many) if you can. Send emails, write letters and call people. There are people who care about your plight - be it out of genuine empathy or just to use you as political leverage - there are people who will want to know about this. Look at the response on here for proof!

I hope your situation improves and I know you will eventually find someone who gives a shit.

Ninja Edit: as someone else pointed out, go see the Citizens Advice Bureau - some of the workers in there are local activists and/or future political hopefuls trying to show that they are doing their bit for the community - keep that in mind.

It's clear that Torres could be scoring and assisting a lot more if he was making the correct runs, but is this laziness or just a lack of a high striker IQ?  Obviously he was scoring many goals at Liverpool making runs in behind the defense breaking offside traps--what has changed?  

Eto'o has good movement and runs, which is probably why Jose prefers him over other options.  He plays like an intelligent center forward by staying central, holding up play well and bringing in other players.  Schurrle obviously has an eye for space and this kid can definitely finish, let's give Him a shot.

We live in a finite world. There's a lot that can be done to make economies grow, so that there's enough money to carry on raising wages and benefits. But the economy is dependent on resources. Resources aren't infinite, so it eventually will reach a point where the economy literally cannot possibly grow any more. The great depression pre-WW2 and the recent recession in 2008 would be nothing compared to that economic implosion. It's inevitable unless we come up with an economic model that doesn't require growth.

But that argument requires knowledge as to *why* the economy needs growth. I think the answer here is debt. We have money that's tied to nothing, so you literally can't run out of it. However, all money comes with interest, which means as long as you have money, you have debt.

So basically, I think the entire economy and how we handle transactions needs a total rethink, from top to bottom. I'm not calling for an end to capitalism (well, I am, but not here and now), because socialism and communism, to name just two others, have the same issues. A reasonable start has been Bitcoin. I don't use it myself, and don't particularly advocate for it, but being interest free and uncontrollable, as well as finite, gives it massive advantages in terms of future-proofing, over the currency we generally use.

Another aspect that's going to help tremendously is a good, thorough examination of society and culture. Most people who despise 'scroungers' would happily help out a family member in need. This kind of points to the heart of the issue. When the defining criteria between helping someone and not helping them is whether you know them or not... to me, that's not the greatest attitude to have.",0,1393776074,null,0,false,0,cfsgwru,t3_1zc74m,t1_cfsgwru,t1_cfsfyq6,null,1432624825,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

In many countries you can't finish high school until your 18, and compared to other countries too many of our people are leaving with poor or inadequate English and Maths skills. And personally, I believe that 16 year olds are (generally, not all) too immature and know too little about the world to be entering the workforce and making wise decisions about their career path. I'm not saying they shouldn't be able to get a part time job before their 18 while their at School (that's their and the employer's choice), but that shouldn't be their only choice after being kicked out of School at 16, for getting too lower grades.

Although, I don't see why it should just for be English and Maths? Also it would be a good opportunity to implement some 'life skills' classes and lessons to teach students how their country/democracy works before they begin to vote. Generally equip them for adulthood.

In all seriousness though this article does bring up some fair points if you can bear to sit through the rambling, overly long pretentiousness contained therein. Wasting food and eating too much is not a good thing and we should probably start cutting down on it. It's a big waste of resources and overconsumption is increasing production not to mention causing obesity. 

The thing is, that as adults we should technically have the sense and right to eat what we want. This makes cutting down on overconsumption seem fairly patronizing. The 'cheeseburger pizza' with its 2880 calories is clearly designed as a shared meal - I doubt I could eat even half of it without getting full, but I'm sure there are those that could and therein lies the issue.

true,tjcefc,null,null,"This is a long as fuck post but I hope it gives an insight.

As a lifelong Evertonian and a season ticket holder at Goodison for the entire of Moyes' time at our club I probably know more about Moyes as a manager than most. I was extremely surprised he was given the United job. I think he is a decent manager but nothing more than that. Yes he did well at Everton (particularly for the first 6-8 years), but the narrative that David Moyes was the only thing keeping us away from the bottom half of the league lost any substance whatsoever after this initial period of stability in Moyes' first 2/3 or 3/4 of his time with us. After that point, the idea of ""plucky little Everton who should be thankful for finishing 7th"" was simply used as a tool to lower expectations and thus essentially make Moyes immune from any criticism. Some Everton fans were blinded by this, others felt that Moyes had overstayed his welcome and were not too unhappy to see him leave when he did.


The fact is, in the biggest games he constantly got his tactics completely and utterly wrong and from what I've seen of United this season he doesn't seem to have learned his lesson and Im not sure he ever will (Semi-final against Sunderland is mainly what Im referring to here, literally predicted exactly how that game would play out as well as the game against Olympiacos).
At the end of the day, that is just indicative of a wider, more deep-rooted issue in Moyes' ideological view of football as a whole. He is a negative manager, simple as that. His ideological core is one of risk aversion, negativity, reactiveness, whatever words you want to use it all points in the same direction. You can see it in every facet of his mannerisms. Watch his press conferences and other media interviews and you can just see how ultimately negative the dude is. He would always focus on negatives and rarely praise players. (just ask Ross Barkley). And this fits into why we always struggled when it really mattered the most. His tactics in the big games were ""try and keep it tight and see if we can nick a goal"". That may work in certain games but in the long-run it won't bring real success.



To an outsider (and to the media in particular) this might seem unfair. What about all the great wins at Goodison against the big teams? Yes they were great but ultimately he got it wrong when it REALLY mattered.
There are 3 specific games I will never forget and I will never, ever, ever forgive David Moyes for - Away for Fiorentina in the Europa League (08 I think) when we lost 2-0 (Almost a carbon copy of Uniteds 2-0 loss to Olympiacos last week, that was classic Moyes tactics). Away at Sporting Lisbon (2010) when we were 2-1 up from the first leg and just sat back for the entire game and comfortably lost 2-0. And finally the worst one of all - Vs Liverpool FA Cup Semi-final 2012. That was the day I wanted him out of my club. That was the day I KNEW WITHOUT ANY SHADOW of a doubt that David Moyes is not and never will be a great manager. 

I have seen nothing whatsoever that makes me believe otherwise. In fact, I am almost surprised by how bad tactically Moyes has been at United. The poorness of United's squad is one of the biggest myths propagated by the current media. It is lazy and incorrect. Of course, United's squad is not as strong as it may have been in the past in relative terms but I believe it is still very, very strong. Particularly with the signing of Mata and the breakthrough of Januzaj who is like a new signing. United won the league by a silly margin last season and not all that much has changed since then squad-wise (I know others have strengthened though). World-class players dont just become bad, the buck stops with the manager. He is who motivates them, who trains with them and who instructs them; Uniteds shocking results this season have been down to the tactics of the manager, that Im quite certain of.

I think with our owners we don't have any shortage of money, just a strict sense of value. We valued Willian at £26m max, they asked for £30m. So it was decided to not overspend. Whilst sometimes you need to splash the cash to land the big names, i.e city in their climb from midtable mediocrity to half-billion-pound-squad stardom. Also ""we"" want to set a precedent of being tough in transfers, not the image that was immediately created with the hurried buying of Carroll.

**However**, I think with us finishing (most likely) 4 places higher than last year, and the Champions League revenue, plus the increase sponsorship money that comes with that, we will have a lot more ""disposable"" cash. I don't know the figures, but there will be more money going in to the club, and FSG aren't going to siphon money out of the club á la Hicks-Gillette. 

Another factor we should consider, of course, is that being back in the Champions league, and a potential contender for domestic success, that top echelon of players will want to come to us, a player pushing for a transfer often lowers the price as the selling club realizes its time to ""cut and run"". The Suarez saga being an exception.

Here's the litmus test for whether that question serves any purpose other than telling the OP that you think she has made a bad decision without actually saying it:

Is there any part of you that thinks she might have responded with something other than ""Yes I'll still want it there?""

I mean - she's so excited to have it that she's posting on Reddit to show it off.  Is she going to read your question, and immediately realize she's made a terrible mistake?  Or does the question serve only as a vehicle for your disapproval?

After all to relate back to your smoking example, people still buy them in droves. 

The trouble is 'Bad' food does taste good, it can be in Pizza Hut, or at home with a deep fryer. I think the only way that it can be efficiently fixed is by trying to get the end users to remember about energy in, energy out and to be active.

No doubt, but I really don't understand the electricity/gas dilemma that is being had. 

Me and my friend shared a flat. Both had TV's on, both had laptops, both had Xboxes.

£25 of electricity each month on the meter covered cooking and all the above. 

£40 on the gas per month covered heating but we only actually bothered heating the place from december to march. 

So £65 a month for that lot during winter. 

Averaged out over the year it's ~£40 per month. Tenner a week. 

I'm a bit dubious toward the claims that things are actually that tight. Plus ours was a two bed place with two people living there. You can probably knock off 25% of that cost if you're a single person. 

&gt;they sacrifice the gas and boil kettles to wash with.

Absolute nonsense. A house price bubble that grows wildly out of control (think Spain before 2008) is dangerous, but one that grows at a modest rate is not damaging at all.

&gt;Higher property prices only help speculators, land owner, banks, landlords and estate agents - all of whom contribute nothing to the real economy.

It also helps the owners, it helps financial liquidity, and it promotes external confidence in the British economy, which aids the sales of bonds to the foreign markets, allowing investment in growth.

And what's the ""real"" economy to you? The one that exists after you take out the bits you don't like? Because that's not how it works. They are paid, on which they pay taxes. They spend money from their salary, which contributes to the economy as a whole. You can't seriously think that them being unemployed would be better for the economy?

&gt;Pull away the artificial support and lets see how much it really hurts the economy.

Oh really, that's how it works is it? Pull the plug on the life support machine, doctor, just to see what happens? Just jump in on an assumption regarding a major economic metric and hope it doesn't totally balls up the economy for decades to come? Good idea!

There's really not a lot of leeway to you have to sue people over a contract that you have no involvement with and haven't agreed to in any way yourself.

Secondly, if it genuinely was Arsenal's decision for whether a lawsuit happens or not, that lawsuit would still be a potential option for them - it's not like there's an expiry date on the breach of contract. Going on record to say that someone has very good grounds for suing you would be a really fucking dumb thing to do because it'd count pretty badly against you if any lawsuit was to happen, and I don't think Henry is that dumb.

What seems to make the most sense, as taken from the PFA and Henry is that Suarez has a clause in his contract that if Liverpool were to receive a bid of a certain amount or more, they are obligated to start good faith negotiations. Which they did. Which concluded in ""no we don't want to sell."" 
 
Arsenal fans are the only ones claiming that Suarez has a clause that states Liverpool HAS to sell Suarez to the first team that bids a certain amount. 
 
Take a step back and think about that for a second. What company/team/whatever would EVER put that in a contract and what PLAYER would ever want that in his contract?

&gt;The **Football League Cup**, commonly known as the **League Cup** or by a name referring to the current sponsor, is an [English men's association football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England) competition. Like the [FA Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup), it is played on a knockout (single elimination) basis. Unlike the FA Cup, where 758 teams entered in [2012–13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_FA_Cup), only 92 clubs can enter the League Cup – the 20 [Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) clubs, and the 72 clubs of [The Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_League), which organises the competition. Also unlike the FA Cup, the semi-finals are played over two legs. The winners qualify for the [UEFA Europa League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League), unless they have qualified for the [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) through their league position, in which case the Europa League berth goes to the highest-placed team from the Premier League not already qualified for Europe.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"Okay, I was planning to reply to the original comment anyway, but I'll do it here instead. While /u/grollcool has done a very interesting analysis, a lot of it is **misleading** and very much colored to show Torres in a bad light. 

I wish to make one thing absolutely clear: I am NOT a Torres apologist but I am very much against players being blamed for things that are NOT their fault. There were many things during the course of the game that Torres should have done a lot better but at no point during the three goals (which, unfortunately, forms the crux of /u/grollcool's tirade) was he even remotely responsible for doing the wrong thing.

If anything, in fact, I believe **Torres played his part to perfection in each of the three goals**, as I shall attempt to explain:

a. [The 'useless' run made by Torres - **was actually from an offside position**](http://i.imgur.com/edSSd13.jpg)

If you rewind the game a few seconds earlier, you'll notice that **Torres is returning from an offside position**. Had he started the run there itself, he would have been flagged for offside and the attack would have broken down instantly. 

Sure, one may claim that **Torres is bad at breaking offside traps**, but at that moment **he did the best thing possible** - stay OUT of play, and that **allowed Schuerrle to sneak in** behind the Fulham fullback.

b. [Schurrle making the correct run - **into the space made because of Torres dragging out the central defender!**](http://i.imgur.com/3oE0vap.jpg)

Again, if you rewind and go back a few seconds you will see that the Fulham fullback is the one to blame here. He is supposed to be tracking Schuerrle's run. Schuerrle loses him and cuts across Torres. This is the moment that starts the **cascade of mistakes** that leads to the second goal. 

With **Schuerrle cutting across the line**, the fullback is caught in two minds - **follow him** (man-mark) or **change his focus** (zonal-mark) to Torres. By staying back, **Torres causes momentary confusion** between the Fulham CD &amp; FB - both were left wondering who would track/mark whom. Unfortunately, for Fulham, **both the CD and FB decided to focus on Torres**. 

This split-second confusion resulted in the great wide, open space that Schuerrle immediately took advantage of and ran onto a beautiful through ball by Eden Hazard and the rest is history.

**Had Torres made the run into the empty space, the central defender would have followed him immediately**. That leaves Schuerrle with nowhere to go and the attack breaks down again.  

By goal three, Schuerrle was effectively **THE** attacking option - everyone was trying to set up his hattrick. In fact he missed a couple before he finally buried the ball set up by - guess who - the 'useless' Fernando Torres. 

Heck, **Fernando even got robbed of an easy tap-in** because Schuerrle was desperate for his third. There was a point prior to the third goal where Hazard veat the Fulham RB, sped to the by line and delivered a superb cutback to the near post but it was deflected by Stekelenberg and the rebound hit Schuerrle's knee and went off-target. 

Had Schuerrle left that ball alone, it was an easy tap-in for Torres.

Please understand that I do not blame Schuerrle for being eager to score, I am simply pointing out that Torres' part in Schuerrle's hattrick was not as horrible as /u/grollcool makes it out to be. **Still images don't always tell the entire story**, you all know that already, don't you?

If anything, the blame for the first two goals rests squarely on the Fulham fullbacks. If anything, the credit for creating them should be given to the one and only Eden Hazard.

Adults, however, HAVE had the chance to understand sex, grow impulse control, and simply know better. If your brain hasn't matured and changed from the time you were twelve years old to the time you're twenty-two, that's another problem entirely.

Lamela should feature at Spurs for a long time as well, and together they could form a great partnership coming from more continental styles of play. The ball seems to come to him before anyone else if he and Lamela are playing together and the ball is at Erik's feet.

The way Netflix works is quite simple.

On your end
You pay for the month and gain unlimited access to the Netflix library.

On Netflix end
They spend our money buying streaming rights for great content and running some of the best streaming architecture you can find online.

***
All you need to access the library is a web browse.*^1
Just go to the Netflix website, sign in and select what you want to watch.
You can do this with anything and everything in their library.
It can be at any time and anywhere.

As for library size and content.
***
 People have found ways to enlarge the Netflix library by accessing other regions Netflix but I won't go into this. Although technically against their terms of service Netflix really doesn't mind. *^2
***
The library is growing, when I first joined the library was limited but it has grown so fast. They are adding stuff all the time. If you willing to watch random stuff they do have some amazing films and shows you may have never heard of. 

***
Remember the more people using them the bigger the library will become.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I could not disagree with this assessment more. 

**1a.** 

The useless run made by Torres was in fact useless. Whether he was onside or not should not be in debate. I am not blaming him for not making a run from where he stood but for his original run which brought him to that spot, as shown by the arrows.  He made a run across the pitch towards the wing, a space already occupied by another player. Once he finished his original run he was offsides, which as you can see in the picture he started to turn around. Also you say  ""*he did the best thing possible - stay OUT of play, and that allowed Schuerrle to sneak in behind the Fulham fullback.*""
That is **completely** false. Do you know who the fullback even is? Richardson, the man behind Schurrle, he was out of play because he is coming back from our half, that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Torres. I am shocked anyone could give credit to him for that.

**2b.** Again, giving credit where there is none to give. Torres was walking at the edge of the goalbox, Hazard is one the ball looking for a run, Schurrle made the run without the help of Torres, the fullback is the only one to blame because he cannot keep up with Schurrle. Had Torres made a run into the center he could have done two things, Open up the space that the CB Bern is occupying, giving another lane for Schurrle and making himself open for a pass. The 6 foot 7 Bern is very immobile, a quick dart across him would leave him vulnerable. That give Hazard two options instead of just one. The space was there and Torres definitely could have taken it. You cant just use ""but the CB would have followed him"" as a defense for that. That is the same with almost any run a forward would generally make.

And for the accusations of Torres not being able to score because of Schurrle, well I wont even begin to debate that one.

I dont try and put anyone is a bad light on purpose. I am just showing the facts. Do you really think that if a player like Lewandowski, Aguero, Suarez is on our team that they would be making these types of runs or plays for us?

I also don't think it would have made much difference to whether Ba actually left or not, other than Newcastle maybe demanding a little bit more money.

Buy-out clauses don't allow a player to force a transfer through, and in that sense they are useless.

**Piano**: It is fairly possible that you can teach yourself the piano, as there exist a number of self-teaching websites and books, as well as Youtube videos and DVDs. Best thing you can do is find a cheap but good keyboard (you can find them for £100 in some music shops) and then either buy a book/DVD or hit Youtube for some videos. 
  
   There is also the fastest option, which is to take tuition. Unlike books or DVDs, teachers can identify mistakes and correct them before they become bad habits, and also teach you in a manner which ensures you progress constantly and which means you get the best out of your lessons and playing. You can easily do a search through Yell or a phone directory and find music schools and tutors, or you can ask at a local college or university if any music students are offering lessons. 

**Violin**: Pretty much the only way you're going to be able to learn to play the violin is by taking lessons. Find a tutor with some experience of teaching beginning adult players, and go from there. 

  Violins are perhaps a little cheaper than the piano, and typically you can expect to pay around £250 for a good student model. You'll also need to buy a bow, which usually start at around £20. Violins have the advantage over many instruments of being portable and decently light even in the biggest of cases, and so if you're travelling abroad, on public transport or transporting it in the car from lessons and performances, it is easy enough. 

  Some tips that apply to both instruments:

* Don't expect to sound good right from the offset. Particularly for violin, you'll likely sound like you're hitting the instrument rather than playing it, but if you can get over this initial issue and keep on practicing, your sound will improve. 

* Both instruments are decently challenging, and you'll likely find that it'll require hours and hours of practice to see an end result. But it's really something to be able to say 'I can play that' and the effort is really worth it IMO. 

* Practice regularly! Even if you manage only a few bars of a song, a scale or even practicing a single note, it is all good. It's no good going a week without picking up the instrument, and then getting to the night before a lesson or whatever and then cramming, which does you no favours. 

* Sheet music is NOt scary, and it is really worth taking the time to learn how to read it (if you take lessons, you'll have to learn it anyway). It will serve to open a world of music to you and it is a useful skill to be able to walk into a band practice, take one look at the sheet music and then be able to play it right off the bat (a practice known as sight-reading). 

* Don't stress if for whatever reason you have to take a break from lessons/playing. It can do you some good to recharge your batteries, and when you do come back, you can get back into it with fresh enthusiasm.

* Play what makes you happy! There is nothing worse than being forced to learn long boring bits of music you can't give two tosses about, but it makes it an incentive as well as more fun if you're playing the sort of music you really enjoy. The great thing about both piano and violin is that they're both fairly versatile instruments which can be used in pretty much any genre I can think of.

Lukaku leaves to another team and like expected does amazing.

Courtois gets mishandled and leaves the club.

David Luiz goes to Barca.

Within the next season Hazard ends up leaving mainly because one of the main reasons he probably loved being at Chelsea was hanging out with his buds Lukaku, De Bruyne, Ba and potentially Courtois. Moves to PSG and gets lured by the money and most likely the trophies they win, one of the reasons he came to Chelsea no doubt. And we are left with only Oscar and Matic as star players and end up with a very mediocre squad.

Having studied quite a lot of globalisation, I tend to assume about 80% of what I buy is going to have made someone suffer somewhere a long the line. 

I do tend to buy Fairtrade food where possible, but even that has its issues (better than nothing), and most of the other stuff you can't guarantee because supply chains are so closed off. 


And the bigger issue comes into play of bad job vs no jobs. So if Tetley pull out of this region/supplier, they just instantly make X very poor people even poorer and having no job, mostly because a few people sat at home said 'oh how awful!' and clicked a few buttons. Of course something needs to be done, but the situation is much more complex than 'stop doing this'. 

Tetley will then find someone else to supply tea at a slightly higher rate, and the previous workers are now on $0 rather than $3.

true,aaulia,null,null,"Ok thats it, I can't defend Torres anymore, I have been defending him for a while, but I think he has lost it. Yes he did sort of ""comeback"" once in a while, but still most of the time he's just ""lazy"" almost like given up now.  
  
Goal #1. He's a striker, a striker returning from an offside position is still supposed to prepare himself for a counter. Instead Torres went to the side of the pitch, what good does he have on that side of the pitch, it's Schurrle teritory. IMHO the correct way for a striker is to take a few steps back, or heck, stops your run a bit, and the second Schurrle raring down the left, you get your ass off and run through the middle. Schurrle might or might not pass you the ball, but at least you give the full back and center back something else to deal with (""pulling"" them) other than Schurrle. And if Schurrle did shoot it and the GK parry it, you're in a position to tap it in.  
  
Goal #2. This I think happen way to often with us over the years, nobody is making the runs in between the defender. The fact that Hazard had to stop and slow down the pace of the play to look for somebody to pass to is fucking annoying. If this were Sturridge, Suarez, Cavani, or any decent striker, they would scramble pulling defender left and right creating spaces for them self, not jogging around the edge of the box hoping some miraculous ball to happen. This argument
&gt; Had Torres made the run into the empty space, the central defender would have followed him immediately.  

Argument is getting old, Torres show no desire to do anything, he just jog around while Hazard is waiting for something to just ""move"". To play the devils advocate, had Torres pull/push the CB toward himself (to the right), Schurrle doesn't really have to run *across* Torres and the CB just to get himself some space, he just need to run behind Torres, while he cover the CB.  
  
Goal #3, I have no problem with Torres on this one, he won the header (albeit, out of luck), and square the ball to Schurrle, since Schurrle is clearly on better position than he is.

I guarantee you won't be eating pizza and chips every day. It's messy and time consuming and this way and it will be nothing more than special occasion food as it should be. 

We are still animals at the end of the day and we evolved to love salt, sugar and fat and are easily persuaded by adverts of foods like that. I've lost a lot of weight myself (nearly 6 stone back to normal bmi) and now that I look back a lot of my own weight gain could be attributed to eating stuff on the run, not cooking stuff yourself, being depressed and drawn to comfort foods. 

Counting calories is good but it's not a good solution in the long run, can you eat with a constant input output of energy in mind? Some people obviously do and it works for them, but it's not for everybody, we haven't evolved to eat with a calculator in one hand so to speak.
Labels on food don't do much because if a product has less fat they'll put some other crap in it to substitute for it which also makes you ill when you have it too much.

We've gotten burned by this sort of thing so don't think that we're taking the positive result of the situation for granted.

So JH bluffed and he came out on top on this one, but after the likes of Arbeloa, Alonso, Mascherano, Torres, etc. its nice to chalk up one for our team. Players have massive power to break contracts with everyone involved concluding most of the time that an unhappy player is not good for the team and that no player is bigger than the club. Hopefully this will set a precedence on players to think before they demand such action since the form for player and club after the fact have been phenominal. Maybe one of those things of, ""Someday we'll look back and laugh"" for Luis and Liverpool Football Club.

Either way, you'd better get used to the double standards because there is too much money, ego, power for football to existing in a utopian system that we'd all love to have. Shitty, but you know this is how it goes.

The whole thing reminds me of one of my favorites. Might be too old for the youngins out there though.

**[EDIT] /u/free2bejc has some [excellent screenshots and posted them with some even more excellent positioning analysis in his comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1zcj1i/excellent_analysis_by_grollcool_on_what_torres/cfsnxw3).**

[Here's the highlights video, I'll be referring to](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/k3V6GCmCMKWSgp5GJWq). It's in Russian, but all I'll need are the timestamps for reference, so hopefully that shouldn't be a problem.

1a. [0:44] - At 51:50, in the second half, Brana restarts play with a throw-in on the right-flank, straight to Schuerrle. Torres is just beyond the halfway line at this point and the entire Fulham team - down to their last defender is inside Chelsea's half.

[00:48] At 51:54, Schuerrle has passed it to Hazard and continued his run down the right flank. Torres is still in an offside position. But Hazard has spotted Schuerrle's run, spotted that the Fulham defense is horribly out of position. Torres, we know, has lost more than a few yards of pace as a footballer. There is no way he manages to outrun the Fulham defense but Schuerrle can. Plus, Schuerrle has a huge start in terms of both pace &amp; acceleration. So Hazard, sends the ball upfield along the right flank and into (what he hopes) will be Schuerrle's path, rather than Torres'.

[00:49] At 51:56 Schuerrle and Torres are neck and neck at this point, except for one HUGE difference - Torres is in an offside position and he is looking at the ball. If Torres makes the run, the linesman immediately raises the flag for offside. Torres drops back and Schuerrle continues his run. The ball drops in front of him and he heads it across the defender - brilliant move, since any intereference by the defender at this point is a professional, last-man foul and a sure red-card.

At this point, **it doesn't matter** what Torres does. He was already offside and out of reckoning when the play restarted with Brana's throw-in. The only way he could have affected the game was if he tried to run on to Hazard's ball in which case he would certainly be called offsides.

Exactly six seconds after this moment, the ball was in Fulham's net. SIX seconds.

What was he doing in that offside position in the first place? I don't remember. I'll have to look at the replay but yeah, there's a definitely possibility that he was being lazy in returning to the half-way line. 

TL;DR - He may have been lazy but his run wasn't useless and that's all I was arguing about. 

2b.

[1:28] At 64:03, Torres in bang in the middle off the pitch, at the halfway-line, where he receives a neat ball from Brana and tries to send it up the right-wing to Schuerrle, who is well up the pitch. This is supposed to be Oscar's job, BTW, but he's a little off-centre, and Hazard is steaming up the pitch behind Torres, along the inside channel.

At 64:05, the ball takes an unfortunate deflection off a Fulham defender and falls awkwardly in front of Oscar who immediately sends it in Hazard's direction. Torres is still near the halfway-line while Schuerrle is near the edge of the box

[1:37] At 64:09, Hazard has just evaded a nasty tackle and Torres and Oscar are on the shoulders of the Fulham defenders. Schuerrle? He is in an offside position, a little ahead of Torres and he is **already going across Torres**. Torres can either go further across or move wider to pull the defender away. He does the latter and **creates** the space because the former would simply end up causing him to crowd into the same space with Schuerrle. 

Schuerrle has already lost his man and is is perfect position to run on to Hazard's ball - which he does.

Why doesn't Torres do that? Because he is the one who started the move from the halfway line and Schuerrle has already reached there first. Should Torres be selfish here? If he does, the attack most definitely breaks down. Since he doesn't Schuerrle gets a wide open space. You decide for yourself.

&gt; And for the accusations of Torres not being able to score because of Schurrle, well I wont even begin to debate that one.

Accusations? What accusations?

&gt; The way you make this comment sound is that if everything Torres did was perfect.

Please re-read my second paragraph:

**""I wish to make one thing absolutely clear: I am NOT a Torres apologist but I am very much against players being blamed for things that are NOT their fault. There were many things during the course of the game that Torres should have done a lot better but at no point during the three goals (which, unfortunately, forms the crux of /u/grollcool[2] 's tirade) was he even remotely responsible for doing the wrong thing.""**

Torres may not have done everything right in the game but he certainly is NOT to blame for his part in Schuerrle's goals. I simply stated there was NOTHING he could have done and I continue to stand by my statement. 

If this post doesn't convince you, then nothing will, I guess.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Not really. Schurrle would have been stuck in the channel with Torres in the way and 2 CB's had Torres not dropped so deep. Equally Heitinga really shouldn't be the one closing down Hazard. The two centre backs should also not be so close, they were almost definitely both following Torres slightly. There should not be anywhere near 4 of them in that small a square. That's awful. Richardson is the least at fault, but he's also ball watching.

The RB being stuck further up which is to be expected, which is even more reason why those two CB's should not be pushed so far up. Torres either coming back from an offside position or simply going deeper than he needs to causes this. The RB barely has a role in this because he's completely out of the play.


Jesus. You're making me want to do a proper post on this so here.

[(Image 1) First of all, the RB is exactly where he should be.](http://i.imgur.com/RWYttml.png)

Secondly, it wasn't a two v two. It resulted in Bern vs Schurrle, which he just about wins using his head, allowing him to move into the centre of the pitch before picking his spot.

[(Image 2) Now we can see Torres, either making Heitinga want to play offside, or causing him to step up from being in line with him. Either way he's sacrificed a few yards thinking he's going to be called off because Torres is obviously the only thread in his eyes. His arm is raised, and he is the only one playing for offside, if he had played on, he and Bern would have had a very good chance of forcing Schurrle wide](http://i.imgur.com/vO1AekH)

[(Image 3) Bern and the RB are the only one's travelling back at speed. Hence they are the only two that even challenge Schurrle. This shows quite clearly Heitinga trying to play an offside trap that they don't appear to all be on. And it backfires, as offside traps often do, tactical error or defenders, definitely a defensive error](http://i.imgur.com/rOw3Fl0)


[(Image 4) And finally, Richardson not reacting at all, even though he's the quickest. Being a LW shows here. He should take a lesson from Willian and challenge Schurrle.](http://i.imgur.com/XqbRw9d)

If I actually have enough time some day and enough procrastinating impetus to do so, I might well do a dissection of Torres's movement. Anyway, Heitinga plays offside because of Torres.

* At no point in the post, do I comment on the quality of the striker.
* At no point, do I make any generic argument in support of the striker.

I have specifically mentioned at the very beginning that the post deals with the three moments and those three moments only. Broadly blaming his 'ineptitude' and 'poor positioning', when I have just explained in great detail that it was neither ineptitude nor poor positioning during the specific moments in question, not only seems vaguely dismissive but also undermines all the effort I took to explain my highly specific position.

Yes, we do not have great strikers at the moment, but that is not the only reason we have lost and/or dropped points through this season. 

I honestly wish people would stop bothering themselves about our striker situation and simply think of any goals scored by them as a bonus. 
If there's a chance we can dump all our past mistakes and start afresh, we will, rest assured. The day you should truly get worried is when none of our attacking-mids is firing - that's the day we'll need a miracle from our strikers.

Realistically, where can you see the results going? Apart from City and Chelsea (and assuming current form) I don't anticipate them dropping any more points. Even if they drop 9 from those 3, that's still  80 points. That requires 28 points from 30, 9 wins and a draw. Let's just say they lose 5 and win 5, 74 points, requiring 22 to go above them.

&gt; I'd rather not see superstar names

What a joke. You want serious replies on the topic of buying a starting striker for Chelsea FC but don't want 'superstar' names. And the rationale is because we have 2 or 3 superstars already? The club is a professional football team, the team consists of superstars. This is a title contending, trophy winning, top flight team not some non-league side. Why *wouldn't* we buy a superstar or at the very least someone on the cusp of blowing up as an internationally phenomenal player.

I'll entertain this though because it's an absolutely pointless reason to purchase or not purchase a striker.

Adrian Ramos (28) - Hertha Berlin - 14 goals, 2nd in Bundesliga goal scorers tied with Mario Mandzukic

Pierre-Michel Lasogga (22) - Hamburger SV/Hertha BSC - 11 goals, 6th in Bundesliga goal scorers, above Arjen Robben

Ciro Immobile (24) - Torino - 13 Goals in Serie A tied for 3rd overall with Luca Toni and Higuain

Ross McCormack (27) - Leeds United - 23 goals in the Championship this season, leads the table among goalscorers

Alfred Finnbogason (25) - Heerenveen - 22 goals in the Eredivisie this season, leads the table

There, non-superstar strikers. Take your pick. Or just Google 'Top Scores [insert league] 2013-14' and pick guys who sit in the top 5 and have names you don't instantly recognize.

We're a month and two days outside of the transfer window, we're top of the league, and we're coming off of a performance where one of our forwards scored a hat trick. That aside, since the beginning of the season there have only been 6 games (in all competitions) where the team hasn't put a goal on the board. 6 out of 42 games.

How this topic isn't a dead issue is beyond me. These threads are just a place for people to jerk about whether or not Lukaku or Bamford are going to be amazing (the answer is maybe) and the handful of possible strikers we may or may not buy in the summer. 

The only difference here is that you're making a case for Remy. 

Clearly you have feeling about the club buying Remy. The thread should be called ""I think we should buy Remy, here's why"".

Once I get home I can hopefully get a HQ recording of the game to show you the snipets of the plays we are discussing because keeping up with all the images is getting confusing.

But I will get you a preview of what I will say.

&gt; there were many things during the course of the game that Torres should have done a lot better 

I completely agree, and that is what my entire post is about. The first goal for example, he made the wrong run plain and simple. He came towards the wing/Schurrle when he should have drove down the center. That one I thought was the most basic mistake out of the 3 goals. I think you are mistaking the run I am identifying. I am **not** talking about the run he starts behind Schurrle after he was already off sides. I am talking about his original run that brought him to that position.

The other goal well I made my points, basically the argument is that Torres was doing the best thing possible by walking at the top of the 18, which I disagree with for obvious reasons. The runs were there and just standing in front of a defender won't get us anywhere. There is a reason Torres statistically has the least chances out off all strikers from the top 5 teams in the Premeir Leauge and it is because of instances like this. He doesnt look for the run in behind, he did not know Schurrle was going to make the run and I can guarantee that if we had Willian playing, someone who doesnt make as many runs as Schurrle that Torres would be doing the same thing.

TL;DR

1. The goal from Brana's throwin to Schuerrle's strike took exactly 12 seconds. Why was Torres up the pitch, in a offside-position? Don't know for sure, could be any number of things:

    i. He was being lazy

    ii. He was waiting up the pitch expecting a slower build-up of play

    iii. He had just finished tying his shoelaces

    iv. He had just finished blowing air-kisses to someone in the stadns

    v. ...

2. &gt; [...] nobody is making the runs in between the defender [...]

    There are various kinds of strikers. Some rely on their pace, some on their trickery, some rely on their team-mates creativity, some rely on their own creativity, some on their strength, some on a combination of factors, some on sheer luck. You can continue to contemplate on the nature and skills of various strikers but until they play in Jose's system, you will never know who fits and who doesn't. 

    I don't know what kind of a striker Torres is. What I do know is that **he started the move in midfield exactly 12 seconds before** the goal was scored from the midfield and got his ass up to the edge of the box by which time Schuerrle was already making his run on to the Hazard pass.

EDIT:

Just saw your comment about Goal #3. Why do you attribute it to luck? IMHO, it was a very well won header against a 6'7"" CB.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"&gt; I am not blaming Torres for Schurrle's goals. I am just pointing out what he could have done better, and what most likely separates him from most top strikers in the world.

You chose the wrong examples to do this, is all I'm saying. He may have been useless at various points in the game but the examples you chose to highlight his 'uselessness' were simply incorrect.

&gt; he made the wrong run plain and simple. He came towards the wing/Schurrle when he should have drove down the center. That one I thought was the most basic mistake out of the 3 goals. I think you are mistaking the run I am identifying.

No, I am not mistaking the run. 

I am trying to tell you he was already offside by miles when Hazard received the ball from Schuerrle and got ready to pass/lob it forward! Any run Torres would have made at that moment would have been flagged for offside.

As to why he was offside, I don't know. The reason may be anything: he was lazy or he was recovering from a previous attack - I'll have to watch the game again to figure that out. If you do, please let me know.

&gt; [...] basically the argument is that Torres was doing the best thing possible by walking at the top of the 18, which I disagree with for obvious reasons. The runs were there and just standing in front of a defender won't get us anywhere. 

It seems you haven't read my second post. Torres wasn't just standing - he was running up from the halfway line where he had just (sort of inadvertently) started the attack **six seconds** earlier. Schuerrle was there first and he made the run - plain and simple. Torres wasn't just being lazy here, he had actually contributed to the attack at the very beginning. 

It sorta went like this: Torres to Schuerrle, deflected to Oscar, Oscar to Hazard, Hazard evades a tackle and dribbles to the edge of the box, and slots in a through ball which is picked up by Schuerrle, who had got there way before Torres even reached the edge of the box.

Don't even get me started on Willian - he needs to add a lot more to his game than pressing and running up and down the pitch. Reduced dribbling, intelligent passing and crossing would be my first requests, if he was taking requests. 

Also, Willian's presence is a hypothetical, let's agree to not even bring it into the discussion, please?",0,1393796293,null,0,false,0,cfsp3xm,t3_1zcj1i,t1_cfsp3xm,t1_cfsolf4,null,1432628756,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

If you watch the boy, he has said it himself that he has only recently (under Jóse) realized his true potential as a football player. Eden seems to me like a boy who needs a mentor and guidance to become one of the greats. Under Jóse he is getting that and he seems really grateful for the club and for the manager. It really comes down to the simplest things, when at pro level, a kid like Eden who's played football all his life, if the game is still fun to play you will see results. Here we have a kid who has played the game for all his life, humble as heck considering his talent, discovering that he can actually win the Ballon d'Or some day. He is not leaving England for a while. We are building a team where Eden can play how ever he likes and he is getting all the attention he would get at any of the other big clubs wanting him.

Ideas are always changing and paradigms are always shifting. Knowledge and research you thought you knew about 5-10 years may be completely benign in today's fluid academic landscape. It is also important to look at meta-analyses, as opposed to single studies.

All the various studies done of dope were collated by Prof Glyn Williams of Bristol Uni a few years ago (I think this paper is on your list). His paper revealed that people who smoked dope were 40% more likely to develop schizophrenia. But as this is a 40% increase on a less than 1% chance anyway, who cares! He also explains that this is not a cause and effect link. There's nothing to say that the dope is causing the increase. The dope smokers are different anyway - so maybe that's the reason not a chemical reaction.


You can watch him interviewed here in this BBC programme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbHy6Xa9BU0 in which he explains all the above better than I just did.


It's also worth noting that all these papes from the 1970s onwards are based on the same data set: a study done of dope smokers in Finland in the late 1960s. That's it! That's the medical communities sole hands on study of the ancient weed. Pathetic.


Additional: if I smoke lots of strong dope every day for ages then I'm going to suffer some negative consequences. So what. This is not a reason for dope to be illegal. If I drank lots of vodka everyday for ages - or took any kind of narcotic - I would also suffer consequences.

true,nonlinearmedia,uk,"London, England","Very familiar, I was also seriously ill last year I had a kind of brain fart came back from shopping collapsed felt like a bomb going off in my head. inconclusive in hospital. (I think the stress and anxiety caused a small vessel to break) but after I went home and basically slept for the best part of a month/6 weeks lost a shed load of weight I was 13 went down to 10 stone. then about 6 months later fell really ill with what turned out to be Pancreatitis caused by small gallstones that migrated across. The gallstones where caused by the rapid weight loss. I actually  had to leave one hospital with cannula's still in because I was left for 8 hours without care on a Friday, I really thought i might die over the weekend if I did not get the F*** out of there. I tried to get it sorted but was told to get back on ward or be treated as an ""absconder"". I staggered on to a bus and made it to the next hospital and pleaded with them to take me in until the mess could be sorted. I never went back to the first hospital and was treated very well in the second. No complaint there at all. 

That was last year. Earlier in the year (january)I was taken to a MH hospital on a statutory section 136 ie the police where called (by my ex trying to make a scene for her own reasons) and they had to take me in. I was then seen and fobbed off by the same consult in our meeting. fast forward to after the gallstones and I had enough and started naming and shaming. This prompted a call from the local CMT. they said oh we hear you might still be looking for support (LOL) I said yes I had been for nearly five years!!! I got a bit upset and explained i had to get off the phone as my operation site was getting angry/saw as well. Result - another discharge. stating the patient got angry and put the phone down, so we are discharging him. I mean really WTF. they had really jumped the shark at that point. mental health patient gets up set so we discharge them????.

Roll on 2 weeks later and I was shaking like a first world war shell shock victim and ended up in A&amp;E.The doctor heard my tall of woe and said look buddy im going to get you on a ward for a proper evaluation. We will wipe the slate and start a fresh and get you the right treatment. So I ended up spending a very scary week on a mental health triage ward. with all sorts of promises of support. I only got the hello interview at the beginning of the stay and the fuck off appointment at the end. They chucked me off the ward with a box of razors and the wrong mediation. I had no money they refused to get transport for me and I walked home. Got home to find they had given me the wrong medication. They then refused to sort it out saying i was discharged and that is that. I had a 7 day review with, yup you guessed tit the same consultant who has been fucking me round for the last 4 years. that was the 23rd December. the MH nurse said she would update me the next day 24th Dec. I did not hear from them again until the 4th of January WTF!!!. after 2 appointments I told my CPN (nurse) I was worried the consult would withdraw the valium that was stopping freak out, and that it would be the worst time if he did. As i had just found out my abuser had been charged and bailed.

The very next appointment with my nurse the meds were withdrawn.
she said she was going to try and get that remedied. But I did not hear back from her. The last contact I had was her calling me on a Friday afternoon 15th feb i believe informing me she was away on another 2 weeks leave !!!! oh 4 days after I had my med withdrawn I ended up in casualty again was kept waiting for six hours by which time it was after midnight. the staff came along said the best thing to do is discharge you no meds nothing, just fuck off bye bye. I tried to record that conversation because I had a feeling the ranks had closed and had a good idea what was coming. The young (milgram operator) Doctor that saw me sussed I was recording and refused to speak until I stopped at which point she then dropped the bomb shell. not surprising she did not want me to record cos if I had it would of been enough to get her struck off.

So hear I am meds withdraw panic attacks back no solution on the horizon feeling like the only place I have to turn now is Samaritans. I am suicidal but am keeping going on the pure anger. I want to expose this callous shower of shit before I leave, so perhaps others wont have to go through this fucking monstrosity of a Mental Health care trust.

My sister who decided after years of denial to get sorted has had a completely different experience and is being well supported. But my local CMT are sick fucks who vilify patients to cover their sociopathic callous arses. 

Fun fact: before I moved to this area I did not know anyone other than my mother who had killed them selves. Since living here I now know 3 all of whom just gave up after being bullied and fucked around by this CMT. the guy running the CMT is purely there still cos the cases either take the one size fits all. Give up, or kill them selves.

Its incredible the variation in treatment in the UK. If I had any resources left I would follow your lead and bugger off to France. I have been to doctors in France before. Used to have a girl friend in Paris.

What has this country come to. its so frustrating because these sort of mind sets that do exist in certain hospitals are helping dig the graves of the working conditions, job quality etc. because the Goverment loves shit like this.

edit: oh I see now, you mean towards the end of the post you respond to and I say RB instead of LB? That was a mistake by me and I haven't edited that post at all. I have clearly been talking about the LB this enitre time, look at my posts with the other guy where we discuss the same thing. I have never been trying to talk about their RB.

edit 2: after looking at your other reply I am getting even more confused, you say 

&gt; (Image 3) Bern and the RB are the only one's travelling back at speed. Hence they are the only two that even challenge Schurrle. This shows quite clearly Heitinga trying to play an offside trap that they don't appear to all be on. And it backfires, as offside traps often do, tactical error or defenders, definitely a defensive error

I assume you made the same mistake I did and refer to the LB as RB

But in the first image you seem to be talking about the actual RB

and then later on you say

&gt; (Image 4) And finally, Richardson not reacting at all, even though he's the quickest. Being a LW shows here. He should take a lesson from Willian and challenge Schurrle.

This is what got me really confused. Richardson is their LB not LW, were you assuming either Bern or Heitinga? That would change everything...Or am I confusing something else? ",0,1393798223,null,0,1393799083,0,cfspy17,t3_1zcj1i,t1_cfspy17,t1_cfsonk7,null,1432629149,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

Cannabis is fantastic at relieving the nausea induced by chemotherapy. It is also preferred by many people as pain relief to opiates due to the lesser degree of side effects. Cannabis' combination of low side effects, pain relief and nausea relief make it an all-round fantastic medication for cancer patients undergoing chemo. As agreed upon by the large number of chemo-patients currently using medical marijuana in countries such as the US and Canada.



As for your first point: lots of good people smoke cannabis and the law has failed to curb that. Good people don't criminalise themselves unless there's something wrong with the law.

I can use myself as an example, at 16 I failed every single subject in school and could barely spell (I remember teaching myself the difference between ""whether""/ ""weather"", ""their""/ ""there"" etc in my late teens). Luckily at 18 I went to college (entirely separate from school in Scotland, more of a safety net) and now I'm in my 20's and at one of the ancients. 










My experience isn't a rare thing, I met a lot of people like me in the safety net of college who like me had 0% encouragement all through school who were perpetually in the segregated ""thick classes"" their entire lives who therefore considered themselves terminally thick. They went on to do insane shit like get interviews for oxford after being told they weren't actually worthless morons in college.









I have to assume people making comments like the ones in here think there's a talent in academia that some people (them) are born with. The reality is academics is literally something anyone can learn to be good at. It's the only thing you can practice to be good at and not need a talent for. Five year old Chinese maths geniuses aren't born brilliant, they just practice.








Anyone can be molded to be anything. It isn't a fluke that the well off children at my school with attentive parents went straight to university at 17 and the poorer children with parents who didn't give a fuck dropped out at 16 after humiliating years in the thick classes. 
















It's worrying that no one makes this connection in threads like this and seem to think children have no feelings and these feelings of worthless aren't going to impact their performance. In trying to stop these children supposedly only fit for shelf stacking from holding back the smart children their potential is wasted.

The rest are pretty self explanatory. Johnson's old, poor form, high wages. Agger is inconsistent, and we have Sakho.

Any proof of long term damage? Or is this conjecture?

&gt;There's no way that anyone who has actually had experience of this is a good thing - whilst it has some medical uses, to the average person we're looking at: mental health problems, reduced IQ, cancer risks (1 spliff is 10x more carcinogenic than a cigarette) loss of motivation and a host of other things we just don't know about. 

Oh dear. I suggest you read up on Marijuana before making bold claims. 1 spliff isn't 10x more carcinogenic than a cigarette - a UK study showed that Cannabis users in the UK were 20x (not 10x) more likely to get cancer. What this 'report' failed to mention was that it is normal habit in the UK to roll *with tobacco* and smoke it *unfiltered.*

Nunerous US and European studies have shown that Marijuana has minor benefits in the prevention of lung cancer; completely contradictory to this one UK study that got glorified in the media.

Point two would be that marijuana has no proven links to *any* mental health illnesses; it can be used however, to treat a range of conditions ranging from Anxiety to Dementia - any substance when abused will cause mental health issues, marijuana isn't exempt from this so while a valid point - it applies to all medication so isn't a factor thar can be soley applied to Marijuana.

It's also been proven that Marijuana doesn't cause a loss of brain function in adults. It can reduce stimulation in brain development of adolescents but then, that's an argument for legalisation. 

And a decrease in motivation isn't exactly a problem - I've just bought my first house, i've got a good job and I work hard and I've been smoking daily for 5 years, don't believe everything you read in the media.

Naltrexone is what they will inject someone dying from a heroin overdose with. I don't know exactly how it works but it basically removes all the opiate bits from the brain receptors within minutes/seconds stopping the high and respiratory depression caused by the opiates and puts the patient into instant withdrawal.

When used as an implant it stops the patient from using heroin as they can inject enough to kill a couple elephants and it will do absolutely nothing. I suppose the downside is if a patient is desperate enough they might cut it out.

There is also Ibogaine which is completely unproven but many people say it works. It is a hallucinogen that apparently causes a spiritual awakening that makes people never want to use heroin again. Obviously it sounds like bollocks to me but people swear by it.

Also there is a procedure where the patient is kept in an artificial coma  or under anesthetic while going through the worst of withdrawal. But of course this isn't without risks.

While the last two I can't see being available on the NHS I think the implants should be considered especially for people that have emotional issues that only intend to use heroin for a temporary crutch but instead become re-addicted.

That'd have to be a bloody big spliff. There is as yet little scientific consensus on the carcinogenic properties of cannabis, a few recent studies seem to suggest it may be around twice as carcinogenic for heavy users who smoke an equivalent amount as a heavy tobacco smoker, but I'd argue that people who smoke cannabis that regularly are in the minority.

In any case neither side (I'm very much pro-legalisation just for the record) can claim science on their side, [check out this google scholar search just for papers since 2010.](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?start=10&amp;q=cannabis+carcinogenic&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;as_ylo=2010) You'll find ""non-carcinogenic"" or ""anti-carcinogenic"" or ""Nx carcinogenic"", mutagenic, not-mutagenic, 3x higher tar per quantity, 0.x tar per average user.... pick an argument and you'll likely find a paper.

true,shimafuci,null,null,"As someone who's currently an upper sixth at a grammar school, I'd like to offer my perspective (I'm in support of grammar schools).

My parents are middle class, but I wasn't tutored for the entrance exam. My dad just went to WHSmiths and bought all the 11+ test papers he could find, and he made me do them for 2–3 years every night. 

I'm very very grateful for this, and I can imagine that if I was brought up in a poor single-parent household, I probably wouldn't have had the same pressure on me, and probably wouldn't have gotten in. I just wanted to play outside with my friends, but my dad made me take out an hour out of every night to do a paper and now I'm reaping the rewards, whilst the same friends who I played with don't have the same opportunities as me.

Ultimately it comes down to how much your parents value your education, and if they're willing to upset their child in the short term (by forcing them to study for the 11+) for longer term gains.

As for the grammar school itself—I love it. I want to do medicine at university, and they offer me so much support. Talks with doctors, mock interviews, UKCAT help, reading my personal statement... You name it. 

I'm also in an environment which promotes academic success. My GCSE maths teacher used to have a motto: ""An A is a fail"". He wanted A*s, and at the end of the day 29/31 of our class got them. I just don't think you can breed that sort of culture in a comprehensive school. 

I see posts on Facebook of friends bragging about 5 As and 6 Bs at GCSE. At my school that would be considered pretty bad. It's this culture of pushing for the top grades that gives us so many opportunities. Many students from humble backgrounds are off to Oxbridge next year; something that most comprehensive schools couldn't achieve.

I think more grammar schools are definitely needed. Many of them are better than a lot of private schools because they want the best, not the richest. There is always going to be some discrimination against the poor because their parents are less likely to be professionals who value education. Without my dad, I wouldn't be here, and I wouldn't have all of these benefits. But what can you do?

Finally the segment reminded, as oh so many forget, drivers that actually should everyone on a bike be in a car or on the bus, then roads would be A LOT more congested then they already are and the least they could do in return is give us a little bit more room.

Ok - yes, I went off the Lung Cancer Foundation research study and narrowed the figure down. I don't however see how legalisation will stop people from smoking in this particular way so the point still stands in the majority of cases and so higher hospital admissions will still be a thing. 

Second point, we're talking legalisation for *recreational purposes* so the temporary relief from anxiety and demetia wouldn't be the main reason cannabis is used (it still stands though that there are other less risky drugs currently permitted that we know the full consequences of, these would probably still be prescribed anyway). Now, whilst it may be hard to conclusively prove a definite link between the likes of schizophrenia and cannabis use -- the sheer fact that we're talking about a mind altering substance here that's been bred to be much more potent than it used to be over the years should be enough to raise eyebrows. Would you not be pretty startled if you saw a pregnant woman smoking this stuff? If, like most people you would be then obviously you can't dispute that its intuition tells us this is going to be bad.

No loss of brain function in adults? Fair enough, but there's still conclusive evidence iirc that children are stunned by it. Normalising marijuana in this way will definitely mean increased consumption by children (as has been the case in Colorado) who happen to make up a large portion of cannabis smokers. 

Decreased motivation, dependency etc are definitely issues. I know so many wasters that got on to weed and now cling to it as there life drifts by. It lets you pretend your problems don't exist, and letting people just psychologically cower away like that is going to be pretty very harmful.

Martin Montoya is still yet to sign a new deal with Barca. He's comfortable on the ball like almost all Barca academy graduates and he contributes goals/assists wise. Personally I think he'll agree a new deal with them as he's starting play for the first team a little more but it would be a ridiculous piece of business if we snapped him up on a free. Also can play both sides.

Yann M'vila is mentioned a lot. From the little i've seen of him he seems to be powerful and aggressive (both positive traits for a DM imo) with a surprising turn of pace. Also looks like he's solid defensively at set pieces which we could certainly do with.

 He's since crystallized his thinking into the [Dickens-Flynn Model](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2001/04/01iq), which emphasises the reciprocal-feedback effect of environmental factors, as I was describing. To quote Flynn:
&gt;The same kind of reciprocal causation explains IQ gains. Environmental triggers raise the cognitive demands of work, family interaction, leisure, and everyday conversation. Those who respond by upgrading their cognitive performance raise the average cognitive performance. Then the rising average affects your employer, family, and friends and they demand or expect more, and you (and many others) rise to meet their expectations, so the average cognitive performance jumps once again, and so on, and so on. The model quantifies this process and shows that quite plausible initial environmental changes would be enough to explain huge IQ gains—gains of 20 points over a single generation.",0,1393805509,null,0,false,0,cfst1pn,t3_1zc4cw,t1_cfst1pn,t1_cfsrn1w,null,1432630613,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Part of the reason people use very extreme forms of drugs is due to it being illegal.

A good analogy would be with prohibition. When a gangster could only smuggle in X amount of liquid, when a cash strapped drinker wanted the most bang for his buck, when the gangster wanted to make the most profit, etc... It's obvious that selling spirits over light beer was the answer and that's how drinking patterns followed.

The same with opiates. Prior to becoming illegal it was smoked as the method of choice, then it became injected, and we've now seen various alternatives such as speedballs and krokodil as desperate and poor people try to get a big hit.

Look at cocaine. Favoured method was chewing, then when it became illegal it became snorted as a powder, then speedballs and crack appeared, etc...

There are far more people in developed nations abusing slow release opiate pills than we see injecting heroin yet it is the heroin users who are the ones causing greater harm to themselves and society, the pill abusers are largely high functioning.

In 2011 the state of California's own ""federal district courts"" (which is a blurry line I don't claim to understand) started going after dispensaries despite their own law saying they were legal.

While that sounds like a complete clusterfuck of contradiction, the same system has enabled quite a few states to experiment with legalisation even while federal law says it's still illegal. 

Obviously in comparison the problem we have in the UK is that we have a singular book of law, small scale legal experiments just aren't a thing.

I feel as though the promise of that core should count for a lot when it comes to the attractiveness of our beloved club. Also the Red Sox have a significant wage bill and just won the World Series when none expected it even compared to the Yankees. I know this is for 2014 but here is as wage comparison for [baseball] (http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/salaries/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees.)

However to solve your issues, you could have requested that payment is made into a foreign account. Or, a GBP account within your origin nation should a bank offer one. There is a small chance your employer would comply. Credit card APR is irrelevant provided you pay it off in time.

I believe MetroBank can give you an account on the spot almost. Santander have a OTP system using your phone. Everything else you mention here is free also, except SEPA obviously. But we are not a Eurozone nation nor as integrated into the EZ system such as places like Switzerland, with its large cross border workforce.

I echo your sentiments about the backwardness of it all. I am also not particularly fond of any 2fa system which requires a physical device other than my phone. I moved to Santander for this reason (works a lot nicer with my scripts too). Security should be a choice, and the repercussions accepted by the user.

The fact that you need to prove residence etcetc is to do with money laundering laws afaik. A simple solution would be if we had the option to prove the right to reside with some sort of ID system. Such a system could ease the process for many thing, including utilities, banks, etc.  But we as a country are irrationally opposed to such ideas. You will have similar issues with many things in this country, especially if you have to move from place to place quite often. Customer Service here is, universally unhelpful, technically incompetent and incredibly frustrating. We have entire sites and forums dedicated to assisting us through this mess.

European banks are just an unfair comparison. German banks even have a god damn API you can interact with. Germany ffs. A nation of people which actively couldn't care less about the latest consumer tech. Our 90s/00s systems are completely backward. Innovation in the sphere is god awful. I imagine the reasons are largely legal more than anything else. But still. Damn. If we could make the area just a little more competitive we would see a lot more innovation. And I mean actual innovation, not just pushing out a WebView and calling it an app. I want interoperability with standard applications. Not your walled garden PoS. I want to be able to see enqueued payments which have altered my balance. I want alerts if someone changes a Direct Debit amount. I want to enforce limits to Direct Debits to stop incompetence from my Direct Debit payees. I want email alerts on suspicious activity, and for any other activity as I specify. I want to tell you if I am going to be in another country on your site, not on the phone. I want to disable your 2fa if I want too. I want to be able to manage my account from the site, my phone, a terminal or a god damn Arduino if I please. I want to be able to open accounts in any currency, with the charges displayed in advance. I want a simulator, to see what b/s you can pull with various types of use. Most of all, I never ever want to have to call you.

However. We're far from the worst in the West. Try a US bank - they're comparatively stone age. There, often, you can't even do a bank transfer between accounts online, for that requires either subscription to an add-on, or a visit to a branch. Australia is a little better but not by much.

true,Nirashad,null,null,"Actually, there might be something to this. At least with the newer regenerations, there’s something to be said for each new incarnation making up for the short-comings of the previous one.

Nine, as mentioned already, was the war veteran. He managed to reclaim much of what it means to be the Doctor (having lost this during his time as the War Doctor), but still had a somewhat desensitized persona. While he could find joy in life and revel in his adventures again, this was a man fresh from battle, showing little compassion or mercy towards his enemies. While this let him cope with all that had happened during the Time War, it meant that he wasn’t able to connect with others in the way he once had.

Ten was far more emotionally involved, and was able to get a lot closer to others as a result. He also embraced mercy to the enemy (within reason), something he had struggled with as Nine. Of course, the problem he faced being more emotionally engaged was that he had to face all of the things he’d done in the past, sometimes to the point of being debilitated by his regret. He tries to distract himself from his guilt, but his personality is ill-suited to cope with trauma. This becomes especially apparent as he begins to unravel at the end of his run.

Then we got Eleven, a calmer and less moody version of Doctor, but with all of the eccentricity and enthusiasm we’ve come to expect from him. Unlike Ten, who was trying to forget the things he’d done, Eleven largely succeeded in putting his guilt aside so he could live his life properly. He didn’t take his losses nearly as hard as Ten did. Then again, he didn’t necessarily deal with those losses so much as he’d just put them at the back of his mind and moved on to the next thing (hence his need to keep moving forward and his impatience with remaining idle). Because of this, he didn’t always learn from his mistakes and was prone to repeating them.

It’ll be interesting to see what they do with Twelve. First impressions seem to support that this Doctor will be more inclined to face his past head on with a clear conscience, but then there’s no way to tell until the new season premieres.

I have no idea if this was the intention of the writers. Just thought it made for interesting character development for the Doctor as a whole.       

TL:TR The new regeneration also tries to compensate for the flaws of the previous one.

 Herd was in contention to make his Socceroos debut but has now been replaced by Jeonbuk Motors defender Alex Wilkinson for Wednesday's friendly between Australia and Ecuador at The Den.

A statement from Villa read: ""The club can confirm that due to personal reasons Chris Herd will be unavailable for selection until further notice. There will be no further comment and we request that Chris's privacy be respected.""

Although the move from Villa looks like a blow to Herd's World Cup chances, Australian coach Ange Postecoglou said the 24-year-old uncapped Socceroo remained in contention.

""We have been made aware that Chris will be unavailable for selection at club level until further notice as he works through some personal issues and we will respect that and have replaced him in the squad for the Ecuador game,"" Postecoglou said in a statement.

""That presents another opportunity for Alex Wilkinson to come into the camp. He did well in the camp in Sydney last November when we played Costa Rica and he has a chance to put his best foot forward, like everyone else, in relation to World Cup selection.""

Herd has only made two appearances for Villa this season, playing in losses to Fulham and Stoke last December.

He did today, obviously in this post and from the match commentators, and he had a very strong defensive showing but he is typically very solid defensively. More so than anyone else fielded out wide.

Going forward, he is one of, if not the best dribbler on the team, he keeps the ball very tight to his feet and maintains good pace while doing so, very useful on the break, which Spurs do less of these days.

He gets in behind the backline on through balls better than anyone on the team, anyone. Rarely see anyone else beat the line round his opposite fullback and get on to a through ball. The fact that his crosses don't get converted into goals really is not his fault, he does put good short crosses from inside or just outside the area very well and has a knack for getting to the byline and getting a ball across the face of goal.

I'm glad he played well today, he's been taking way too much shit on here lately. The same sub that clamors for Townsend, who is pace and nothing else.

But writing last year in the peer-reviewed Archives of Sexual Behaviour, Bailey said that while he also found the notion ""disturbing"", he was forced to recognise that **""persuasive evidence for the harmfulness of paedophilic relationships does not yet exist"".**
