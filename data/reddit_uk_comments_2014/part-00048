true,JosephFurguson,null,null,"Allow me to answer all possible avenues for this question:

* IRL, this episode was written before the notion of a War Doctor was created. Moffat wrote this episode with the idea that the Doctor was going to have one more regeneration after Matt Smith.

* In the universe, the Doctor needed to die at Lake Silencio. The Silence knew about the Time Lord's ability to regenerate. The Silence would not know if this was the last time. They needed a full show to be convinced.

* Who was on the Beach instead of the Doctor? The Teselecta, a race of Time Traveling Miniature Humans who go after criminals from different time periods to punish them, lent the Doctor one of their ships. He was inside the suit.

* Why did the Teselecta know to do that? They were in the room with Melody Pond when she transformed into River Song. They assumed this was part of the process. Also, the Doctor was inside the suit directing.

* How would the know how to copy it exactly? They have on staff a woman that prides herself on getting things perfect. She would want it done perfectly.

* Why did the Teselecta allow one of their suits to be used for this ruse? Having the Doctor owe them a favor is probably more valuable than a suit.

* How can the Teselecta fake that kind of energy? The first time we saw them, they faked a motorbike. Why would faking time energy be any more impossible?",0,1392693936,null,0,false,0,cfi0suo,t3_1y3pwh,t1_cfi0suo,t3_1y3pwh,null,1432444168,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

How terrifying it would be to hear voices in your head, or get urges to kill, or be paranoid about anything and everything, or any other of the plethora of symptoms different mental health problems can give you. 

What is achieved by labelling Moat a monster? Does it get justice for the victims? Does it help prevent this sort of thing happening again? No, if anything, it does the opposite. It encourages people who do get mental health problems to hide them, due to the stigma build up against them. It makes it more likely for events like these to happen again. 

The only thing it achieves is alleviating the blame. 'Moat was a monster! It has nothing to do with me wanting lower taxes thus cutting services like mental health!'.

I personally, agree with you on the point that Mata couldn't defend, he might put a tackle in or two on a good day, but usually, his defensive work was below average and I felt it could've been better. Judging by how hungry he was for first team football (he left us for United, after all), you'd have hoped that he could've put in more of an effort to track back and help the team out. 

However, what he contributed attacking wise and creatively, was a huge loss when we sold him, as we now have to rely on Oscar as our sole No.10 (not to question his ability, but Mata was much better last year, though I suppose the vote of confidence for Oscar has allowed him to flourish).

I'd only left Mangala out by mistake, can't believe I forgot him. I'll make sure to include him (I'll edit his name in in a minute).

Yes, to protect the sub from outside abuse, protect it's vision and because it can be personal.

&gt; It doesn't need to be exclusive. Seriously. Keep it private if you must but let regular /r/chelsea[3] members request membership. Mods could easily check user history before approval in order to keep the trolls/agitators/gunners out.

They already can.

&gt; You say the sub name has nothing to do with nationality but I don't buy it. Hostility (no matter how slight/subtle) towards non-UK fans is evident in the broader chelsea fan community and I have no doubt that at least a few of those elitists belong to /r/cfcuk[4] . The magazine may have provided some inspiration but I bet that plenty of your members feel it's meaning transcends that.

Not true and it's been discussed why. Cfcukers are not British elitists, because they aren't all British anyway. It's too multicultural for it.

&gt; I'm seeing some discrepancies between some of the defences of the subs purpose.

There's a few purposes and they aren't all mutually exclusive.

I like to be a bit radical in my predictions, in part due to my studying of statistics and knowing that they can be used to show many things and can be used in a biased way, so I tend not to believe them. I do feel we have it in us to win 3-1, and the shaky-ness of our defense recently didn't leave me expecting a clean sheet too much. However, I did feel that Mourinho would want to start building form again and try to put Everton to the sword, which would also even out the score due to the away loss earlier in the season.

If I did offer myself one criticism, it's that I'm never totally realistic when it comes to predicting the Chelsea scores, and can be a bit biased at times, as I sometimes seem to predict the results I'd like rather the results I think are most likely.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"This study is fraudulent in the extreme, and you really shouldn't be quoting it as ""fact"".

*One of the most commonly cited studies of the “97 percent” was conducted by a University of Illinois professor and a graduate student who asked the following questions to 10,257 Earth scientists working for universities and government research agencies:*

*Q1. When compared with pre‐1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?”*

*Q2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?*

*They received responses from 3,146 people, of which only 5 percent self‐identified as climate scientists. To get to the magic 97 percent in the affirmative to both questions — in the answers to questions even many skeptics would answer “yes” — the study’s authors had to whittle down the survey to a paltry 79 “climate scientists,” defined as those who also have “published more than 50 percent of their recent peer‐reviewed papers on the subject of climate change.” The National Academy of Sciences survey is similarly skewed.*

So they did the most blatant cherry-picking possible, using only scientists who have already published more than half their papers on the subject (and therefore have a vested interest in not rubbishing their own work), and used that to state ""97% of ALL scientists agree ...""

Even a straw poll of 79 people wouldn't be considered statistically valid, but you'll happily allow our governments to make decisions that affect all of us based upon it. More fool you.

I agree that the temperature has risen since the 1800s, Industrial Revolution etc etc ... and obviously human activity has played a part, there were less than a billion people on the planet in 1800, there's over 7 billion now, a 600% increase. Of course man has an effect.

The issue is whether silly Carbon Taxes and turning off our lights an hour a year will actually make a difference, or whether we should focus on what humans have *always* done when faced with Nature. Adapt.

Because all this talk about ""saving the planet"", is so much hot air. The planet doesn't *care* if we live or die. If we as humans, with all our collective knowledge and technology, can't use a bit of fucking common sense and build another story on our house, or perhaps NOT build 2 inches from the shoreline, then we really are fucked.",0,1392699996,null,0,1392700417,0,cfi3dej,t3_1y60de,t1_cfi3dej,t1_cfhqacz,null,1432445445,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

For example, I would recommend splitting your final thoughts into several sentences: ""We start to near the ‘business end’ of the season, so building and maintaining form is a massive priority. The 3 points at stake this weekend will be vital in both teams’ challenges for their respective targets. Both teams have a week’s rest in preparation for the game, so this will be a fiery affair that will be high-energy, fast paced, and a treat for all 40,000+ fans attending the game on the early afternoon kick-off slot at Stamford Bridge.""

“The players, the manager, everybody at Aston Villa and the fans believe they have got the class to stay up,” said the 34-year-old, who made 219 appearances and scored 12 goals for Villa.

“They proved that last season. Obviously the club took a different path in the last two seasons, they’ve brought in a lot of young players and a lot of inexperienced Premier League players and it’s really difficult for them.

“That will take time. At Cardiff, it was not a surprise because every club down the bottom is fighting for every single point and that’s going to be from now until the end of the season.”

Villa do not play again until they visit Newcastle in 10 days and are heading to Portugal for a training camp.

They also have to face Norwich, Swansea, Hull, Stoke, Fulham and Crystal Palace in the bottom half.

And Petrov believes Villa know how to handle the pressure after last season’s dice with the drop.

He said: “Every single point will be important from now until the end of the season. What Villa showed last season was great strength and courage.

“They went on an incredible run at the end of the season and they stayed up. All the other teams know Villa are capable of doing that and I think the players know that.

“At the end of the day the Villa have shown that every time they are under pressure they go and perform, so I think it will be exciting for the fans and the club for the next few weeks and months.”",0,1392703835,null,0,false,0,cfi4qik,t3_1y7wwz,t1_cfi4qik,t3_1y7wwz,null,1432446088,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

I'm really disappointed and saddened by the reaction to this cosplay. We love to dress up for fun, and it seems like half of this community disapproves of the ""sexiness"" or revealing nature of the cosplay. I find this to be ridiculous, judgmental, and undeserved.

Gallifrey One was so lovely and everyone welcomed us with open arms. I've gone every year since I started watching the show, each time with different cosplays that ranged from closet cosplays (Femme 11) to crazy full-on costumes (such as Bar-Maid Clara last year) and each year was a blast. But as for this subreddit, well, I never expected a Doctor Who community to be this standoffish. Now I'm super sad.

If you'd like to know the amount of work that goes into a bunny suit, you can go here: http://rufflebuttcosplay.deviantart.com/#/art/Tutorial-Bunny-Suits-Part-One-The-Suit-346132442?hf=1

Making two of these in a week is last minute. I made mine in about a day and a half. Chloe's still needs more work. Here's what the back of her costume looks like: http://instagram.com/p/kX0fTUsPpa/ since people were asking. The cord holding her lace is all hand done. That task alone took over two hours (and I work fast). Not to mention programming embroidery is not a magic trick that happens in a snap. 

Anywho. I adore Dr. Who and it was a very large portion of my childhood. I spent Friday nights in Des Moines, Iowa watching Red Green, Red Dwarf then Dr. Who on PBS. I've even cosplayed Tennant in his regular clothing. I went with a bow tie because bunnies have bow ties and I went to several stores looking for a tie that look like Tennant's and failed. I was disappointed too.

Thank you for the positive comments and I can only hope the others lighten up. We had a lot of fun and it was the point. Getting to share in my nerdy fandoms with others is really great. I've spent the better part of 7 years perfecting the bunny suit and am very proud of what I've done with it. 

I guess there's no real point to my comment other than a few clarifications, so carry on!",0,1392712305,null,0,false,0,cfi6vu6,t3_1y6tbi,t1_cfi6vu6,t3_1y6tbi,null,1432447099,115,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,115

That's how you choose to see it - I choose to see military service as a choice of profession / career and of course within that there are many different career routes from caterer to drove pilot to surgeon. 

Armies function on a sense of comradeship that doesn't necessary exist outside that sphere. I - that is joe public - don't need to hail every single military person as a hero, or thank them, regardless of their actions.

Doing so *does* send the wrong message of unquestioning support. It shouldn't be a job you take because you want everyone from politicians to the public to love you and worship you for that choice.

&gt; Yes, to protect the sub from outside abuse, protect it's vision and because it can be personal.

Just outside abuse or the rest of the chelsea fans as well

&gt; They already can.

Read through this thread. A number of people have explained that they have requested invites in the past only to be ignored. The fact is that it was secret until only recently and didn't need to be.

&gt; Not true and it's been discussed why. Cfcukers are not British elitists, because they aren't all British anyway. It's too multicultural for it.

I'm not claiming the sub itself or its membership as a whole is elitist, I'm just saying that if there are elitist members, which i'm suggesting is possible, they probably take a different meaning from the name. I don't even care about this point much at all, so I don't want to argue over it. 

&gt; There's a few purposes and they aren't all mutually exclusive.

But when /r/chelseafc  serves more than one purpose (quality discussion, picture appreciation, rumour talk etc.) it's a tragedy and worth leaving over.


&gt; Not the purpose at all. You've missed the point entirely.

I believe that you had good intentions and this post was meant to serve a good purpose but I'm saying that in reality the only purpose it achieved in serving was to remind the rest of us that you are still out there having your private better quality conversations without us. The best responses that this received were mostly along the lines of ""the sub doesn't bother me at all, but why do we need to discuss it?"".

.

My main reason for disliking the whole thing is this. Having your chelsea discussions away from the rest of the sub does not fix the quality problem it just makes it worse for those of us who can only access the entry-level chelsea sub-reddit. If the best contributors to /r/chelseafc are being invited into the inner circle, you are actively working on taking away the best contributions to the sub.

Cosplaying is about dressing up as a character, and those characters are works of art, and the people getting involved with said art have something called the artistic license. You're free to do whatever you want with it, and as long as it's still vaguely Doctor-based, then it's still technically fanart, and you're fine.

I also have to say that you did indeed say 'Doctor Bunnies' in the title, and while I was surprised to see that picture instead of literal bunnies(I'm running on four hours of sleep after being awake for 24, don't mind me, my brain is half fried), now that I've seen the picture, the title makes sense. If people are getting angry because they thought you meant the actual Doctors, then obviously they can hardly read and whatever they type isn't something that should be taken seriously.

I'm personally an artist, and I've got to say, I think Jessie did fantastic on the costumes, and you both wear them well. I'm no tailor, but I'll be damned if I can't appreciate well made clothes.

That's on an artistic level. Personally, you're both very gorgeous, and you look like you're having fun with it, so all's fair. From the Whovian stand point, I'm pretty sure half the Doctor's message is somewhere along the lines of being a decent person and having fun while doing so, and you two seem to have that down, while some of the others...

Before care.data comes into effect, a couple of things need to be considered: 

* The conflict between the Data Protection Act and the Health and Social Care Act is absurd and needs sorting, not least so that GPs are clearer about their obligations, as data controllers, to government and patients. Government can collate pseudonymised data without the need for consent, but at the time it leaves GP practices it contains identifiers for linkage across multiple databases; as data controllers, GPs are therefore obliged to inform patients about the disclosure, how data will be used, and how to opt out.

* One way of getting around this conflict would be to pseudonymise health data at source and prior to extraction. [Open source](http://www.openpseudonymiser.org/) tools have been developed specifically for this purpose.

* Better alternatives to a single opt-out have also been mooted, including a system of [dynamic consent](http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1294), which would allow patients to opt in and out of different health databases however they see fit. Although there would be no legislative obligation to seek consent for the use of pseudonymised data -- [hence why your pseudonymised data are already used for a number of existing health databases](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1y3kx9/new_nhs_database_could_be_used_to_identify/cfhdr8h) -- it's good practice and, in my view, helps empower and inform patients about data usage and its utility to health research and service quality.

&gt; 1.9% growth in Consumer Prices Index (CPI) in the year to January 2014, down from 2.0% in December 2013.
&gt; 
&gt; The fall in the rate resulted from price movements for recreational goods &amp; services, furniture &amp; household goods and alcoholic beverages &amp; tobacco. These were partially offset by price movements for miscellaneous goods &amp; services.

The same problems are still there. At some point when politics is split so harshly on a geographical basis for multiple generations (Thatcher was in 79, that is 35 years) it is going to put pressure on political union. Simply put no nation can survive when the attitude of some section of it is routinely ""fuck them"" to the rest.

As it is a collision of SNP popularity and Tory revival (partially causal) has led to this point.

true,angg56,k9,K-9,"If anything I think the 50th anniversary situation (By which I mean An Adventure in Time and Space, Day of the Doctor, and Time of the Doctor. After thought, The Five-ish Doctors &amp; Night of the Doctor as well) really helped me collect my thoughts on the recent series which had become kind of a mess of similarities in my head.

The main series has/had recently become much to far stuck up it's own arse to put it bluntly. Every thing that was built up to be a massive pay-off turned out to be even more build up for an ultimately disappointing conclusion. Like Amy and Rory's last season was just build up to Clara, but then Clara's season was just build up to Trenzalore, but then Trenzalore was just build up to the 50th anniversary, but then the 50th anniversary was just build up for what is sure to just be more fucking build up.

Now, there were some things I really liked about Day of the Doctor, so I'll start with those. The interactions between War, 10, and 11 were great. And the scene in the dungeon was fantastic. Over all it was a good *episode* but it was a terrible 50th anniversary special. 50 years is a long time, and at 50 years I'd say you are probably aloud to have a big, silly anniversary special. Like, Daleks, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, K-9 etc. all the biggest names just absolutely everywhere with constant in-jokes about Doctor Who canon. But instead there was one really silly looking semi-obscure race of aliens and an obvious Nine replacement. And there were certain things they did really well, like the Tom Baker scarf on the nerdy chick and the talking about the history of UNIT. But then they had to go and throw subtlety out the window with that dumb part with Tom Baker at the end there. I guess what I'm trying about this one is that they choose *weird* things to bring back from the old series. Also, the Pandorica arch was a way better 50th anniversary arch than this mess.

Well, I don't have much to say about Night of the Doctor. Except 11 really had a lot of off screen adventures that I personally think sound far more interesting than the stuff that happened on camera, I mean honestly, anything would be better than that dumb shit about singing an old god to sleep. And naming a town Christmas just for a stupid joke in the teasers? That was also fucking dumb. The entire episode had no suspense because I had already seen a bunch of promotional stuff saying ""Peter Capeldi is the new doctor"" so I knew that 11 was not going to last the entire episode and it just became waiting for him to Deus Ex Machina himself some new regenerations.

But the other 50th stuff was excellent and really felt like a love letter to both classic and modern Who. Unlike the main episodes that were just trying to sort out all the problems they caused by adding all that edge with the time war.

TL;DR (I don't blame you): Moffat so far and more specifically the 50th anniversary are far too focused on just inventing problems and acting like they have cured cancer when they solve them than fully using the 50 years of canon they have to work with.",0,1392721052,null,0,false,0,cfi8e7v,t3_1y4el1,t1_cfi8e7v,t3_1y4el1,null,1432447812,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Erm no, rules for CAP subsidy are most definitely an EU 'providence'.  

The Single Farm Subsidy component of CAP specifically requires 'unwanted vegetation' be removed as a qualifier under a 2003 regulation.  So unless you're an orchard, or claiming permanent pasture and not claiming agricultural subsidy, then they expect you to fell the trees.

http://www.reformthecap.eu/issues/policy-objectives/economic-prosperity      

What Council Regulation (EC) 1782/2003 does say is that a member state or regional authority may establish 'minimum requirements' as to what qualifies as good management under the Annex IV framework - and it is the Annex IV framework that names: 

        ""minimum livestock stocking rates or/and appropriate 
         regimes; Retention of landscape features; Avoiding 
         the encroachment of unwanted vegetation on agricultural 
         land.""

So a farmer to receive his CAP Single Farm Subsidy has to claim his farm is agricultural not arboreal land.   The trees themselves serve no purpose to the farmer's production of grains, cereals, whatever else.  So they are classed as unwanted vegetation.  By the rule of the law their hands are tied.  However those trees do serve a massive importance to the wider community, in that treed land is up to 70 times more effective in absorbing runoff water.  Land with trees on it comes under the term  'Permanent Pasture' at the EU, and they're not going to give you an agricultural farming subsidy for permanent pasture.  You can receive subsidy for sowing a whole field with trees, but they're not going to give you anything if you're trying to raise livestock or grow crops.  It's another case of how the EU and CAP, out of the best intentions to try and increase productivity, is actually conflicted - even schizophrenic.

The farmers cut down trees because it's the only way to stay competitive with other farms receiving EU subsidies.  The collective effect of that is that the urban districts are more prone to water damage and flooding, whilst water courses are more expensive to maintain, and overall productivity decreases.

What we could do, if we had control of our own agricultural policy, is redefine 'permanent pasture' on its local environmental impact, and stop making farmers decide on an either or pigeon hole to receive subsidy, so a crop farmer isn't obliged to cut down copses and treelines to stay in business.

For those struggling to get the info out: the last line of the bottom table shows what percentage of the population earn a certain salary before tax.

Projected estimates for 2013/2014 based upon the 2011-12 Survey of Personal Incomes using economic assumptions consistent with 
the OBR’s December 2013 economic and fiscal outlook:

Lowest earning 1% of the population earn £9,800 or below  
Bottom 5%: £10,900 or below  
Bottom 10%: £11,900 or below   
Bottom 25%: £15,200 or below  
Bottom 50%: £22,200 or below   
Bottom 75%: £34,500 or below  
Bottom 90%: £51,500 or below  
Bottom 95%: £71,200 or below  
Bottom 99%: £164,000 or below

So, in a room of 20 randomly selected UK workers, you can expect one person to be earning £70K+ and one to be earning &lt;£10K.

Wow....just wow. Too wee too stupid. Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg,  Andorra, Sweden, Estonia...

&gt;the knowledge pool and labour pool it can call on to protect both its interests and add efficiencies etc is significantly reduced.

The knowledge pool? Scotland has some top universities and more relative to the UK as a whole. This is a devolved matter and is not due to the UK government but mostly the Scottish Government and EU. Our population is statistically about the same or slightly more educated than the rest of the UK. There is great potential in the life sciences, engineering and computer science fields to name a few.

How would the interests change so drastically that our labour pool couldn't keep up?

That said, if we don't qualify for Champions League, it will be far from the end of our prosperity. If we bring in a proven manager like Van Gaal, we can continue progressing toward our goals with our current squad (who we would be able to hold onto) while we wait for the new stadium to be built. Levy runs the club like a business, but mostly in wages. He has shown that he is willing to spend big on transfer fees (and Lewis has to love owning a club that sold a player for 100m). Our major drawback (in terms of attracting players) is wages. We are very responsible here in that Levy uses match day profits to pay for the wages at the club. With a bigger stadium, and more people attending matches, we would be able to offer bigger wages to potential transfers.

This year is not make or break, especially with a managerial change. We simply need to hold our own and be in or around the Champions League until the new stadium is built.

What disgusts me are people like you who perpetuate the old stereotypes, such as the male is always the negative default. It disgusts me that that men are used for every add campaign against things like domestic violence, rape and sexual violence as well as child abuse and pedophilia when these issues are anything but a specifically male trait. You are a disgusting person for perpetuating such stereotypes and feminism is a hate movement for perpetuating the default negative of the male.

Especially when we look at studies and statistics and see that women are the majority of child abusers at least 1/3 of child sex offenders. When we know that women are the instigators of most domestic violence especially when it isn't reciprocal. Women also attain sex without consent within a relationship much more often than men and by feminism's own definitions this makes them rapists, so more women than men rape their partners, but it doesn't suit the forced narrative of corrupted little bigots like you to admit these things so you perpetuate the belief of the dangerous male and the victimized female.

You little girl are pathetic. Learn accountability. Learn equality.

Let me put it to you another way. It is more probably that you as what I would assume are a female in her late teens to mid twenties given your mentality, are a child abuser, it is also more likely that you have forced un-consensual sex on your male or female partner than a male in your demographic. 

By perpetuation untrue stereotypes against the male you engage in overt sexism. In short sweetheart, your a fucking scum bag but you would have the world believe you are a victim. Seriously child, go away and let the egalitarians who don't demonize things like science and facts get on with making the world a better place, because child, people of your mentality are incapable of the task. You belong in the past. And believe me, when I have to say this to someone obviously so young, it disturbs me.

That is backward. Firstly, why do you want to control people and force them to do things and where do you get the authority to do that?

Secondly, if a company does not compete to give its customers something they want that company will go out of business. It is in every companies interest to bring down costs while improving the product they sell, without competition there is no incentive to do that.

true,Shuhnaynay,flair5,,"I probably agree with his premise, even if the idea that Harry being the reason we aren't getting Champions League is laughable.

The fact is that the football landscape has changed since we got Champions League, and we cannot possibly keep up. We're expecting to finish in amongst teams with spending powers far beyond ours, and the longer it takes us to do it the less likely it becomes.

When we made the Champions League, our starting lineup included Jenas/Palacios, Alan Hutton and Peter Crouch. That might be cause of optimism (if we did it then, how can't we do it now?!) it actually just shows how much the Premier League has changed in such a short period of time. That same squad would struggle to finish 6th this year. Now that City's financial doping has fully clicked in and Liverpool's three or four years of high spending are paying off, we just cannot compete. 

We had probably three opportunities to prevent this from happening. The first was under Jol, where we were unfathomably unlucky to get the shits to prevent getting fourth place. But we didn't learn: when we were in the Champions League, our January spending was on Steven Pienaar and fucking Bongani Khumalo. Unsurprisingly we didn't get fourth again. Finally, the following season, when we flying, we get Louis Saha and Ryan Nelson in January and totally capitulated. That was easily our best chance, as one of the big spenders was struggling. But we didn't take it.

So now we need teams with financial power (and squad talent levels) far in excess of ours to fall over themselves and hope we can sneak in. And if we don't get top four? We likely lose at least two of our best players, and our ""Come help us get Champions League!"" sell in the summer to potential replacements sounds more and more hollow. 

The reality is that we have no business in the top four, and if our performances against the top sides this season continues, will not likely end up there. But in a way, that's the Spurs way: lots of promise with no end product. Spurs will always be the ""almost there's"", the side that will always fall down, rebuild, get so close and fall down again. In a way, that's half the fun.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Rising wages in real terms is the best reply

But how do you actually do that?

It is very hard to have a wage rise in real terms.  If peoples wages rise, the cost of their services and produced goods rise, commodities rise because more people want them and can afford them driving the prices up and up (see something like sweet light crude over 20 years).

One way is by better efficiencies, you can produce something for the same price, despite paying people more, because they are now more productive, this is often hard to do, as frequently the market for the product doesn't always rise, if you triple efficiency with some mechanisation, but the market size only increases by say 50%, well you've got to loose half the staff to achieve that.

It is hard to do this in practice, it is often the private sector that has been doing it, all be it slowly, keeping inflation low helps that.

The argument is, if you simply raise minimum wages, you just create inflation.  However, if you have had it stable and low for a few quarters, you could look at doing so gently.  The main thing is, the economy isn't a simplistic second order system, it is very complex, doing something rash can have terrible consequences.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Wouldn't deflation therefore affect the housing bubble?

No, or rather I doubt it.

Deflation via central banking is trying to make the cash you have more valuable.  Deflation can create a rush to sell, but selling a house is a pain.  If you are renting it, brilliant, because you don't lower the rent price every month.  Effectively you've got a deflation free income.  What a good thing.  If you've borrowed money against it, even better!  No reason to sell.

As for buying?  A lot of the driving force in London at least is just simple supply and demand, high demand, no real supply (just see how few houses are even listed for sale as a % of the stock).  Given stamp duty and the like, the idea of selling the house just to re-buy it later isn't attractive, unless you are expecting a significant drop in price.  This is just high transaction costs.

Given the deflation in these contexts are tiny, tiny amounts.  I doubt it would have any negative effect on housing.  Indeed those who are speculative and long housing (think it will get more in demand) might well take advantage of the lower borrowing rates, and buy more.  Like cheap mortgages this could help drive house prices higher.

These are problems with capitalism, and can be solved by abandoning a system that aims to maximise profits for the few, but instead aims to pass the benefits of technological improvements to everyone, to try and improve everyone's life.

Being the center referee is more art and less rulebook. Unlike linesmen, who are trained that everything is a yes/no (onside or offside, goal or no goal, foul or no foul), pretty much every infraction requires some subjective analysis from the ref. 

What people frequently fail to realize is that you cannot just compare averages, show that one is different from the other, and conclude that the difference is meaningful. This is all just confirmation bias. The author wants to show that Webb is doing strange things, so he shows that he isn't an average EPL referee. Everyone already knows he isn't an average referee; he's been one of the top 3 refs in England forever (I've consistently thought Phil Dowd would be the face of English refereeing if he lost a little weight).

Edit as I was on mobile:

If a plane reaches the decision height and it's not a stable approach (as in it they're too high, too fast or too low or slow) then they'll execute a missed approach and try again. Usually they aim to be on the [glideslope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system) around 5-8 miles from the runway threshold. The rule of thumb is around 300ft descent for every mile, so at 5 miles out they'll be at approx. 1500ft or so. Depends on the approach - London City is a steeper approach and that rule doesn't apply.

Generally after 2 cracks at it they'll divert as they'll start getting towards the start of their 45 minute reserves and don't want to declare a fuel emergency (as Ryanair seem to do often).

If you read [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#Origins), where David Ricardo is mentioned and talks about [Comparative Advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage), he has been proved right. Comparative Advantage is something that almost every economist, right across the board, agrees on.

&gt; I don't see how we can return to the freer markets you speak of, we'll likely never be free of subsidies, trade tariffs, fuel tax and the others. 

I agree with that. The trend shows we will have more government intervention in the markets and less competition. It is something wanted by politicians, corporations and the general public alike. I am one of the very, very few people that believes in the free-market lol.

This is just as bad as confirmation bias. Who says he is one of the best refs in England? Why do they say that? What is it based on?

From what I have seen of Webb (bias acknowledged), he is not a particularly good referee (and I think there is some evidence to support this beyond just my personal opinions and viewings). Consistency and putting the rulebook before ego and unwritten rules/guidelines (such as the tendency to not give penalties because it could negatively 'influence' the game, such as in Webb's officiated World Cup, or because you have already given one) are what separates a good referee from an average or poor one. These points have to be my biggest criticism of Webb and I understand what you are saying about being ""more art and less rulebook,"" but I really think that is a poor way for referees to view their place in the game (and should be frowned upon in officials training) as it opens the door to unchecked egos and an inflated sense of self-purpose. 

Referees are not what makes football the 'beautiful game' and should avoid making themselves the center of attention (as challenging as that may be) as much as possible. Competent consistency, and avoiding refereeing cliches or self-proclaimed guidelines, are some of the best ways to keep officials from trying to become bigger than the game itself.

true,skinnyhulk,eng-kent,Kent,"OK, I'm going to attempt to give some context to this opinion piece and hopefully give you all some perspective.

&gt; switching from spring to winter sowing

From the point of view of the writer this is bad, however, Winter sowing as opposed to Spring sowing, typically results in less weed growth in the field as well (less pesticide used). Also many varieties of wheat require ""vernilisation"" which means a few chilly days to enable spring flowering so the break crop needs to be winter sown. The crop yields for winter crops are typically much higher.

&gt; Worst of all is the shift towards growing maize,

This is actually a problem more to do with wheat. For context, the price of wheat dictates the price of all other crops and livestock (similar to oil price dictating everything else). The price of wheat has massively spiked in previous years going from £62 per tonne in the early 2000's [Source 1](http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/1630.pdf) to over  £180 per tonne as of this month [Feb 2014 price](http://www.fwi.co.uk/gr/markets/FWMP_HGCA_Delivered.pdf) this has meant that it is no longer viable to use wheat as the main basis for feedstuffs.
An alternative had to be found, and maize was chosen in part because the whole plant could be used (silage) and also because the protein levels are close to that of wheat at 8-11% [Wheat is at 11-14%](http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5019e/y5019e0b.htm), there was not and still isn't a large amount of crop disease in the UK (new crop) as opposed to oats.


&gt;  growing maize, whose cultivated area in this country has risen from 1,400 hectares to 160,000 since 1970.

Oddly (like OSR) this is in part because the varieties of maize that were suitable to be grown in the UK did not exist. Remember maize originally comes from much warmer climates [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize) so specific varieties had to be bred to cope with the UK climate.

So why do we now plant it in winter?
This is because as well as maize being a feed crop it is also a 'break' crop. This is to prevent a build up of diseases in the soil (blight, wheat fungi et al) that effect the 'cash crops' (high value, for sale, crops such as wheat, potatoes and to a lesser extent oil seed rape).
Crop rotation many years ago become so stupid it was literally wheat-rape-wheat-rape.

So as the price of commodities rose of course the market dictated that maize production increased. either that or your sirloin steak Mr Monbiot would cost you £100 a piece.

&gt; In many of these fields, soil, fertilisers and pesticides are sloshing away with the water. And nothing of substance, the paper warned, is being done to stop it. 

Utterly subjective, shit is being done about it, http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/news/149380.aspx the problem is mainly a perceived enforcement issue.
With regards to pesticide contamination I have to chuckle at DEFRA and the EA, as they have a lot of power with regards to punishing farmers contaminating watercourses and the environment, but they do fuck all. For example (Grandfather rights excluded) Anyone handling any pesticide in an agricultural setting is required to have NPTC PA1just to handle them, and either a PA6 (knapsack) or PA2 (boomsprayer) to apply pesticides. The training and license covers correct procedures and methodology as well as the regulations that MUST be followed [NPTC](http://www.nptc.org.uk/qualificationschemedetail.aspx?id=260)

&gt; Because the current government dropped the condition
But farmers CAN still be bollocked for failing to cross comply and causing erosion or being negligent in soil protection. Add to that there is actually no point in farmer Giles ploughing up maize to leave the soil bare without planting straight after as the nutrients in the soil will just wash away, most farmers or at least 99% would leave the Maize stubble in the ground until a short while before seeding the next crop, this is to ensure a high organic content in the soil, thus aiding in nutrient retention. I can sort of see his point as he seems to know fuck all about farming, so connecting exemptions to oh shit we flooded the country is quite easy.

And just for the record, my opinion is a lot of farming has to change, but bear in mind the average age for farmers is [53.3](http://farmbusinesssurvey.co.uk/DataBuilder/Default.aspx?module=UGExampleFarmersAgeType) changing their attitudes towards a more scientific approach takes quite a while. So don't tar all farmers with the same brush. Many are trying, and many are succeeding in improving the environment, but this shit cannot be fixed quickly, and with the low uptake of agricultural students, it could get worse.

Mr Beith. My name is theresanotherjoswell, I live in your constituency and I am very concerned.

The Home Secretary is planning to authorise the use of water cannons by the Met Police. I am firmly against this decision.

The Met has a history of mis-judging situations. They have shot dead people who were completely innocent and they have a history of brutality. These are completely forgivable however. As a large urban police force, they will inevitably make mistakes from time to time.

But this is not a trend from the distant past. The Met will continue to make these mistakes, this is an unavoidable fact.

We therefore must deny them the power to cause mass injury to large crowds of people. It is inevitable that at one point in the future, there will be a misjudgement, mis-communication or accident in which potentially dozens of people are permanently disabled by these machines.

You cannot surrender to a water cannon. You cannot communicate your willingness to comply when you are bombarded with high pressure water, so powerful that it can blind you.

We cannot give the power to instantly disband peaceful demonstration by the use of these ultra-violent machines to a police service in which there is very little recourse for the mis-judgements of their officers.

I hope you sympathise with my concerns, please communicate this to the Home Secretary or other relevant Ministers.

&gt;On 14 June 2009, Italian club [Milan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan) announced that the club had signed Cissokho, subject to medical, with a reported deal of €15 million.   Cissokho underwent his medical on 16 June, but the very next day it was revealed that he had failed it due to a problem with his teeth that could indicate potential spinal problems, and that the move was in jeopardy of collapse.  Later that day, Cissokho declared he had passed a second medical he undertook, and that he had, subsequently, signed a pre-contract. In the meantime, Milan tried to re-negotiate the bid on a loan basis due to Cissokho's health concerns; as the parties failed to reach an agreement, Milan [general manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager), [Adriano Galliani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriano_Galliani), subsequently announced the deal was cancelled.

We need to evaluate what role we want our prisons to take. If we want our prisons for purely punishment, then fine, offer whole life sentences. However, I don't think our prisons should be about that. They should be about reform, trying to make people who have committed crimes into productive members of society. By taking away this option of parole and of freedom, you are not only ruling out the fact that people can change over a long sentence, but you are removing a major incentive of good behaviour. 

One argument you hear over and over again, and what is currently the second highest comment on the BBC website, is along the lines of 'what about the human rights of the victim'. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but revenge isn't a human right. Seeing the perpetrator suffer isn't a human right. What is a human right (as far as I know) is fair justice, and it shouldn't matter who the person is or what they did, they should always get this. 

Another argument you hear is about keeping dangerous people off the streets. Now, if I remember correctly, anyone who is going to be released from prison, be it after 2 months for speeding tickets or 30 years for murder, will have to go through the parole board. If the parole board deem the person to still be dangerous, that person will continue to be in prison. There should never be a situation where someone dangerous and likely to re-offend is put back on the streets, and if they do, it is down to the failings of the parole board, not the law.

Eriksen alongside either Paulinho or Bentaleb with Sandro/Capoue behind makes the best use of all three(whichever three) and they're still left with a variety of options to setup out wide, they can go for pace and width with Townsend and Lennon or use Chadli and Dembele who can offer the ability to take on fullbacks or come inside and play off Adebayor.

Those four options out wide will be able to offer a better defensive ability than Eriksen and allows the fullbacks the option to get forward or not, creates more variety in possession instead of with Eriksen drifting in, Rose always has that space in front of him and always leaves space in behind when he comes forward where as they're more conservative on the right, all of the time it's the same, be more effective if either fullback could at times push on or stick.

The disruption to the industry was immense, but we are all the better for it.  Most people wouldn't ever be able to afford to send telegrams as they wished, but now I am constantly reminded how many people WhatsApp etc from all over the world, for virtually no price per message.

This kind of change is lovely and all that, but it is constantly changing demands for one thing or another.  Inflation, people often mistakenly think of as one magic number.  It isn't.

Some things become much cheaper, others more expensive, these inflation measures are selected to try and be indicative of what everyday life costs are changing by.

The fear is, if you have deflation, or people think you might.  Why own anything.  Why buy today when it will be cheaper tomorrow?  Some argue the same for zero inflation rate, there is no incentive to buy anything today.  As economies like ours do better when there is demand, having a low average inflation, that means most things are not getting unaffordable, yet incentivises people to buy them today.  The other problem with zero, is that you encourage people to be inactive, savers get no penalty for not putting their money to work.",0,1392733448,null,0,false,0,cfib2aq,t3_1y89dp,t1_cfib2aq,t1_cfiagd5,null,1432449137,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

FIFA. The FA. The Referees Association. His longstanding ability to govern a game.

&gt; Consistency and putting the rulebook before ego and unwritten rules/guidelines (such as the tendency to not give penalties because it could negatively 'influence' the game, such as in Webb's officiated World Cup, or because you have already given one) are what separates a good referee from an average or poor one. 

&gt; Referees are not what makes football the 'beautiful game' and should avoid making themselves the center of attention (as challenging as that may be) as much as possible.

In my opinion, these points are mutually exclusive. People want to see open, free flowing soccer; look at all of the criticism that Stoke got when all they did was hard tackles and long balls. The referee must let the players govern themselves a bit, and he does this by making the borderline judgements: foul or not, yellow or just foul, red or yellow. 

I agree with you that Webb's ego has gotten a bit out of hand. And I think the media attention on his off-the-pitch conduct is good, as it will refocus him.

He clearly has potential to be one of the best keepers ever, he's already topping leagues and breaking records at the age of 22, but he isn't complete yet. From what I've seen of him, he often parries the ball to the side or back into play, causing more danger, and I just don't see him carrying that voice at the back that Cech has. Cech is starting to dwindle but he would still walk into almost any team in the world, and I don't think Courtois has done quite enough to topple him.

Should we bite the bullet and let go? Maybe. I think Courtois should definitely stay and I would love to see the two coexist. If they can't, I think we will have to end Cech's reign early (at 10 years, no less), maybe get a bit of cash in for him (he's contracted [until 2016](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/9295743/Petr-Cech-commits-to-Chelsea-for-four-more-years-after-signing-new-contract.html)) and get Courtois fitted in.

By Christ this is one of the toughest line ups to choose. Who do we put next to Vinny? A less rested lescott who performed against an average Chelsea (no disrespect to them but they weren't their best) or Demi who is better at possession, has the experience but is slow and throws himself at every moving object like a puppy? With no Milner (banned) and Ferna just returning from injury (and one yellow away from a ban) do we risk the young brazillian or throw Javi in there? Maybe even a 4-2-3-1?

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"ALRIGHT MOTHERFUCKERS THIS IS HOW SHIT IS GOING DOWN NEXT SEASON (or at least I hope how it goes down)

It is given that Cech is a Chelsea legend however he dethroned Carlo to earn this spot and he was as old as Courtois at the age that he did it at. Granted Carlo had injuries at the time but nonetheless we gave Cech a chance and it is time to do it again.

Now as much as I hate how Courtois' father is handling the situation and footballer dads in general pull off this kind of stuff and ultimately most of them interfere the careers for the negative, he is the kind of talent that only comes every once in a while. I think footballing mothers should be a thing since they have better foresight &amp; an ultimately better interest at heart than us men.

We are aiming to be the best in the world and for that we need to retain players like Courtois even if it goes against our egos and teaching them a lesson about forcing moves. So here is what we do next season.

We bring back Courtois and give him a chance to break into the team by giving both Cech and Courtois equal chances. Nothing in the sense of alternating them every game but something like 5 games each at a time so the tempo is not affected. This obviously goes against the next season plan where minimal risk taking is going to occur so we can focus on the league but maybe we can do a bit more. 

This now leaves us with 3 absolutely incredible goal keepers. Cech, Courtois and Mark. That is the goal keepering line up and depth for a team that wins a Champions league. If we then carry on this depth and acquisition of talent in the rest of the squad we will be well on our way to not having to choose the B plan against teams like Bayern (even though we can beat them with it).

At this point one of these things happen.

- 1) Courtois proves not to fit in or is not able to perform better than Cech

We now have given him the chance. Do not allow him a force out of the club until it has all gone horribly wrong instead tell him to shut the fuck up and now go on loan again and come back when he has leveled up enough.

- 2) He is as good as Cech 

Keep on alternating the keepers if it is working out for us and is resulting in more competitiveness and better performances. If one buckles under pressure he gets one game less and so on. Ultimately one will win.

- 3) He is better than Cech

Give him the starting spot. Cech now however takes over the responsibility of ALL non-Premiership and CL games. He has what it takes to handle them easily. 

I also think that an example has to be made out of one of these youngsters trying to force moves. We have 2+ dozen players out on loan and if one forces a move like this it sends the wrong message to the rest of them. Therefore we need to make example of one of them who is behaving extra twatty even if they are a big game and release them instead of ever letting them step foot at the Bridge again.

If Courtois wasn't as good as he is he would've been the perfect candidate for this for the longevity of our loan policy however we are in the worse position in this situation and frankly we kind of owe him after his great spell because that also sends a wrong message to our loanees.

true,kyhadley,null,null,"I really think it's possible Courtois is going to pull a ""Cech"" on Cech. The age parallels between the two situations are pretty striking. Cudicini was nearly 31 at the start of the 2004 season while Cech was 22. Now Courtois will be 22 at the start of next season while Cech will be 32. 

The key difference being of course that Cech is probably our best keeper ever. Jose can be ruthless though when it comes to difficult personnel decisions and even if it is a step down to Courtois, I don't think it's a big one and I don't think it would be one for long. At some point I think you have to sacrifice 3-4 more years of Cech for 10-12 of Courtois.

As /u/IlliniQuant mentions here though, I've initially disregarded the whole injury thing which was obviously a pretty important factor as it's easier to bench an injury-prone player.  He's right in that it's questionable if that he would have done that otherwise.

Also I think Cech's form has dropped just a smidge this season. I don't like how timid he's becoming and his aerial presence has never really been a strong suit of his. While Courtois wouldn't be able to match his experience, I think he has Cech beat with his physicality both in the air and in the box.

In all I'm leaning towards seeing the beginning of a new era with Courtois between the sticks next season a la Cech in '04.

He does the basics better, he keeps possession more and has better pass accuracy, he tackles more, has more energy to get up and down the pitch and also has a better attitude to further improve himself.

If we are talking about England players they also have to be role-models, who is the better role-model?

Wilshere was caught smoking, has an aggressive attitude on the pitch and generally isn't the best role-model to youngsters.

This is a jump. An EU referendum would be good in many ways because when the pro-EU side wins it'll put an end to the noise for a few decades. UKIP will probably dissolve and by the time the next vote comes about most of the sceptics will no longer be with us.

Essentially in the long run an EU vote is great for stability. It allows us to put all this bullshit behind us for a few decades. Likely forever.

In other words, abolishing the monarchy would create a lot of negatives for our country (tourism, national identity, ect… even if these things don’t apply to you they do to many, I can list more if you want but hopefully you get the idea). While doing very little to improve our democracy (You could make a list of how you think our democracy would be improved with the abolition of the monarchy and how it would affect the majority of people if you like). 

Compare this to sorting out some of the major undemocratic problems in our society, lobbying for political influence, members interests, union vote rigging, these are all undemocratic things that nobody could possibly argue FOR. So why try to dismantle something that so many people love. Surely it is better and more democratic to try to improve the state of our democracy by getting rid of things which are universally hated.

I would also say that no country has ever been fully democratic in every respect, and you don’t need to be fully democratic to be a democracy.

I don't agree.  The justice system is not about revenge, and satisfying a victim's family is an awful way to judge whether or not a punishment is appropriate.

&gt;In an ideal world this would never be needed, and such a punishment would act as further deterrent to those possibly thus inclined, but the best we can really hope for is slightly fewer of these crimes happening and those cases where they do having more appropriate sentencing.

Don't agree with this either.

Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole seems like a perfectly reasonable alternative.  Are the suitable for release?  No? Don't release them.  Yes?  Release them.  How simple was that?

No, I would not consider exile, deportation or death sentences as alternative.  Exile makes no sense, if they aren't our problem they're someone elses.  Deportation makes no sense since we shouldn't (or, in some cases, couldn't) rely on other countries to carry out the sentencing.

The only thing that bugs me about him (as a player, mind you) is that he doesn't have a right foot.  It seems to be that way with lefty's for some reason.  He tries to do 95% of his shooting/play making/dribbling with his left foot.

Henderson isn't nearly as flashy but he's been rock steady.  Makes all the simple plays properly, has some creativity, but appears to still be nervous in front of net when it comes to finishing.  

When it comes to the world cup squad, I want Henderson.  He has a cooler head, is a more responsible player, and he can deliver all the same quality of play as Wilshere.

Just that simple huh? I'm not sure I can ever imagine a situation where I'd be comfortable with you sitting me next to someone who planned and carried out the beheading of a person but reassured me that they were much better now and were really very very sorry. 

Furthermore, the idea that if you can fool the system or show you've rehabilitated, they'll review your sentence after killing a person might make the idea more attractive to someone who might otherwise not. 

&gt; Deportation makes no sense since we shouldn't (or, in some cases, couldn't) rely on other countries to carry out the sentencing. 

Awesome, so we get the crime *and* the bill at the end of it - possibly keeping our prisoners in far better conditions than they might otherwise experience. Good for the criminals, especially any who are using it as a way to avoid being deported! 

&gt; And the death penalty would have done nothing to prevent the murder of Lee Rigby

It might not, but it does send the clear message that if you take a life in such cold blood - your own life will pay the price. 

The idea of supporting those who kidnapped and tortured and raped and killed men, women and children does not work for me - nor does turning them loose on the streets again.

The point of the privacy is for protection, of both outside abuse and their goal. The point is to not exclude all Chelsea fans. They're open to admitting anyone who shares their vision for that subreddit.

&gt; A number of people have explained that they have requested invites in the past only to be ignored. The fact is that it was secret until only recently and didn't need to be.

I can't speak to the past, I wasn't involved in membership requests. I'm still not but I can say that they have been adding new members in the past few days as a result of the increased exposure from this. I'm not sure how it was kept secret - they were open about its creation, they don't deny its existence as far as I know, and most members are open about being a part of it.

&gt; I'm just saying that if there are elitist members, which i'm suggesting is possible, they probably take a different meaning from the name. I don't even care about this point much at all, so I don't want to argue over it.

I can respect that you don't want to argue about it, but if people misinterpret the point of the subreddit, it's not really a fault of the members but that person in particular. Certainly the majority are not elitist and don't encourage that rhetoric.

&gt; I'm saying that in reality the only purpose it achieved in serving was to remind the rest of us that you are still out there having your private better quality conversations without us. The best responses that this received were mostly along the lines of ""the sub doesn't bother me at all, but why do we need to discuss it?"".

There were a lot more responses than just that and it's definitely done more than what you said it has. If people are reading into it that it's just there for private conversations where they look down on the main sub then I can't really do anything. That's a preformed misconception that the post was trying to dispel. If someone doesn't want to open their mind to accept an alternate explanation, then they shouldn't have even bothered opening this post.

&gt; Having your chelsea discussions away from the rest of the sub does not fix the quality problem it just makes it worse for those of us who can only access the entry-level chelsea sub-reddit

The alt sub was made because people didn't seem interested in those discussions, which has frustrated and driven some away.

Most Scottish exports that could be beaten in price have been well gone for a long time. 

(For now I'm going to ignore your assertion that Scotland would be out of the EU as it is a more cloudy matter and we could find hundreds of different legal options that will all contradict and argue for hours. What is more surprising is that you seem to disregard the prospect of Scotland being in the EEA or a common sense agreement between the rUK and Scotland to protect industries on both sides of the border by the use of a unique economic area but I'll ignore that as well).

Excluding oil and gas (since we could probably agree that it's finite and just gets in the way of true figures):

Food and Beverages 32.2%
Engineering and Allied Industries 26.5%
Refined Petroleum, Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Products 24.3%
Non-Metallic Products, Other Manufacturing &amp; Repair 7.6%
Metal and Metal Products 4.7%
Wood, Paper and Printing 3%
Textiles, Clothing and Leather 1.7%

From that list the most volatile would definitely be the bottom three which accounts for about 12.5%. Food and beverages will see the least impact as that's an export of products unique to Scotland.

Engineering &amp; Allied Industries is a field that I have much interest in and most of the expertise in the areas that Scotland exports (Mechanical, Electronics, Electronic Instrumentation) is not going to be easily replaced by another source (most of the 'engineering' imports listed on EU and UK figures cover a completely different type of products and is not intellectually based - Scotland's a hot bed for engineering knowledge).

It is a similar story for the 'Refined Petroleum, Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Products 24.3%' although this relies on a much smaller number of EU/UK exports and is expanding rapidly (life science research is actually starting to have a huge impact on the chemical part of this industry).

Where is the breakdown of the collapse of the country coming from?! These industries are not going to disappear over night and you will not find a single expert who will argue that.",0,1392742049,null,0,false,0,cfieexo,t3_1y57pe,t1_cfieexo,t1_cfidh3z,null,1432450716,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Deflation destroys investment, there is just no incentive. All you have to do is look at the nightmare Japan has had with it to see that no right minded person wants deflation.

There is no shadowy organisation or government benefiting from inflation. Put simply inflation benefits borrowers at the expense of savers.

**Referendum Promises**

""Today, I will give this cast-iron guarantee: If I become PM a Conservative government will hold a referendum on any EU treaty that emerges from these negotiations."" — David Cameron MP, The Sun, 26th September 2007

""Nothing will do more damage to the pro-European movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide, that we do not have the ""cojones"" to carry our argument to the people."" — Nick Clegg, the Guardian, 15th October 2003

""The electorate should be asked for their opinion when all our questions have been answered, when all the details are known, when the legislation has been finally tempered and scrutinised."" — Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP, speech to the House of Commons, 20th April 2004

""This constitutional treaty can only come into force once it has been ratified in accordance with the constitutional arrangements of each member state. In the UK, this will require primary legislation amending the European Communities Act 1972 and then endorsement in a referendum."" — Rt Hon. Jack Straw MP, Foreign Secretary, speech to the House of Commons, 26th January 2005

""The Government have made it clear that the constitutional treaty will be ratified in the UK only after a referendum."" — Geoff Hoon MP, Europe Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 23rd May 2006

""There is no question of any constitutional treaty going through without the express consent of the British people . . . Regardless of how other members vote, we will have a referendum on the subject."" — Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP, Prime Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 21st June 2004

""The Government have consistently made it clear that the mechanism in the United Kingdom whereby the European draft constitutional treaty could be implemented is approval by the House of Commons followed by a referendum of the people of Britain. There is no question of implementing it by the back door."" — Douglas Alexander, Europe Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 31st January 2006

""The EU's constitution is so new and large a document that it would be right to hold a referendum on it. "" — Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Danish Prime Minister, EU Observer, 31st May 2003

""I am logically in favour of a referendum. It would be the only legitimate way. "" — Jacques Chirac, French President, speaking about the EU Constitution at the EU Thessaloniki Summit, 21st-22nd June 2003

""The referendum should go ahead in any event. Of course it should."" — Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP, Prime Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 20th April 2004

""It is absolutely clear that there should be a referendum on the European constitutional treaty, and that remains the Government's position."" — Geoff Hoon MP, Europe Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 16th January 2007

""We will put it to the British people in a referendum."" — Gordon Brown, General Election Manifesto, 2005

""... ratification must be subject to a referendum of the British people."" — Liberal Democrat Party, General Election Manifesto, 2005

""As for the changes now proposed to be made to the constitutional treaty, most are presentational changes that have no practical effect. They have simply been designed to enable certain heads of government to sell to their people the idea of ratification by parliamentary action rather than by referendum."" — Dr Garret FitzGerald, former Irish Taoiseach, 123

""There’s nothing from the original institutional package that has been changed."" — Astrid Thors, Finnish Europe Minister, TV-Nytt, 23rd June 2007

""They haven't changed the substance - 90 per cent of it is still there."" — Bertie Ahern, Irish Prime Minister, Irish Independent, 24th June 2007

""In terms of content, the proposals remain largely unchanged, they are simply presented in a different way... The reason is that the new text could not look too much like the constitutional treaty."" — Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, former French President and Chairman of the Convention which drew up the EU Constitution, addressing the Constitutional Affairs Committee in the European Parliament, 17th July 2007

""The good thing is that all the symbolic elements are gone, and that which really matters – the core – is left."" — Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark, in Jyllands-Posten, 25th June 2007

The news agenda depends on a variety of things, not least where an incident is occurring, what else is dominating the headlines that day, and how noteworthy it is. There are also practical considerations like available staff numbers on any given day.

What if a protest group were staging a rally on the same day as 9/11 or 7/7? Should we turn the headlines over to them, giving them equal airtime to another protest which had happened on a far quieter day? What if a religious, racist or lobby group was masquerading as a protest group in order to further a political cause? And would a peaceful rally deserve equal coverage to a riot, if the attendance numbers were the same? If it didn't happen the BBC would be giving its opponents an open goal once the airtime figures were totted up.

It would probably also bore the pants off viewers and listeners. The Countryside Alliance might stage a protest every weekend in the year and be guaranteed airtime. At some point this stuff ceases to be newsworthy.

Furthermore, estimates by police, organisers and the media of the numbers of people involved in protests always vary wildly. Organisers will boast of a healthy turnout while police might downplay numbers to make it look unsuccessful. Should there be someone employed to independently monitor crowd numbers and illuminate the BBC bat signal if it passes a certain threshold?

As for the BBC, it seems they aren't held to any standard of impartiality, so I can see no rationale for mandating that they *must* cover protests. Also, it would very difficult to enforce. If the threshold was based on the number of protesters, then the BBC would be screwed if a protest was unexpectedly large, and didn't last very long, since depending on the location, they might not be able to cover it immediately. 
It's inherently impractical to try and enforce objective rules about how someone deals with a subjective thing, and protests are very subjective. The size, issue, and conduct of protesters, might equally be deemed worthy of coverage by some, and not by others, so who decides the threshold for how many protesters there must be before the BBC is required to cover it, and who counts?

We generally have to send a team out to dig trial holes, where we run a 0.5m wide 1m deep trench through any soft verges to see exactly what's down there. Anything under the road is usually deep enough so that any work won't disturb it, but for major work you either have to get the utility or a specialised detection company to come out and plot the location of services.

Sometimes you can run into major problems because services aren't where you expect them to be.

For sure but getting people talking about an issue does have the potential to eventually effect change. 

I wouldn't think that they'd be obliged to have someone on the scene were it unexpected but that doesn't mean that they won't be able to acquire footage and still cover the situation. 

&gt;protests are very subjective. The size, issue, and conduct of protesters, might equally be deemed worthy of coverage by some, and not by others

This kind of addresses my point. Why should the fact that a protest turns nasty or happens to be a hot topic make it newsworthy? If a large group of people consider something important enough to get off their arses and tramp through the streets then shouldn't that be newsworthy enough? Why should the whims of a news editor trump the actions of the many?

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"I was about to comment about the issue of alternating keepers. I'm not convinced by this sort of situation... it goes against the idea of having a definitive No 1 who gives you stability - it's such an inherent principle of the game. Your '5 game rotation' plan seems like a better middle ground, gives them both a chance to prove themselves against each other, though I'm still not convinced on the viability of it. Keeping both players happy, in-form and confident would be an almighty challenge.

Interesting thought: Cech and Courtois have their respective strengths and weaknesses, using them in rotation would give us the opportunity to use a certain keeper against a certain team, depending on *their* strengths and weaknesses. I could see this coming into play - Jose isn't afraid of trying these things. He's the ideal manager to have for this situation, really, in the sense that he's not afraid to mess with things you don't mess with - like rotating and changing your keeper. He has some experience with these types of situations, as well, and I trust his man management, more so than any other manager in the game.

Regarding point 3, isn't this the current keeper situation at Real Madrid? I don't follow Spanish teams, does anybody know how well that works for them? Expanding on that, is there any other situation we can draw parallels to with the Cech/Courtois debate (other than the Cech/Cudicini issue)? Might give us some further insight...

This isn't under threat as initially the Scottish Government would receive the taxation that goes to London right now (which is a smaller deficit than rUk to such an extent that the increased borrowing costs would almost cancel out under worst case unlikely scenarios.)

'think on quality and price it can be a world leader?' you keep on trying to quote me but fail miserably each time.

The rUK NEED to trade with Scotland in many areas and this can't be avoided as their are industries which exist in Scotland that are giving the market an export that is difficult to be found elsewhere. Can you not understand that if the rest of the UK could source what it buys from Scotland overseas then it would do so in a second. 

Almost everything that countries in developed Europe do can be easily replicated and made elsewhere UNLESS they require some sort of intellectual input in which case it would take many years to do that transfer. Even then you can at least see it coming years away and adapt (e.g. the aerospace industry in Scotland has changed quite considerably with development in Eastern Europe).

To suggest a country of this nature would collapse completely to such an extent where it wouldn't exist is pretty arrogant and kind of racist. It suggests that Scottish people are stupider than other countries who have started from MUCH MUCH more difficult situations.

If you still think that the Scottish market will be severely undercut then I suggest you do some reading on any HMRC, EU and Scottish Government data you can and actually learn a bit about how the Scottish economy is structured.

First, outline a relevant situation to the question. Ask to clarify if the question does not make sense. Better than babbling hoping you hit the mark. Read up example questions and make sure you have a few examples of things.

Second, explain the task. What were you required to do. What made this situation different that makes it relevant?

Third, what action did you take to achieve the required outcome? Why did you feel it was appropriate?

Fourth, result. What happened as a result of your actions? Did you gain anything from the experience? Did everything work out?

Its a process I saw called STAR. It helps build a framework to answer a lot of questions. Just remember to be honest and not trip yourself up by lying or dressing something up as a lot more than it was. 

Also, do not say more than you have to. When you know you have answered a question, don't try drag more out. Ask them at the end if they want any clarification on any answers you have given. Feel free to tell them about any skills or expertise you wanted to highlight but couldn't.

What on earth gives you that impression?

Given the nature of the crime and their motives for doing it - do you really see them as successfully rehabilitating back in to society? Or any of the people who have murdered and killed in such cold blood?

Not necessarily - I didn't mention the victims families, someone else mentioned that. 

&gt; Ahh, the message. Not the practical effects. 

Presumably the practical effects follow the message - rather like coming down hard on the disruptive kid in the classroom so that everyone else learns not to act the same way. That line of thinking is hardly new..! 

&gt; ...because a politician wanted to show he was tough on crime, regardless of the effects it has on society.

Well if the result is not having to share the streets with people who think it's OK to murder other people - I can't say I have an issue with that. It's almost as though you're sticking up for the criminals here... which I just can't fathom.

true,TheresanotherJoswell,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,"My argument against water cannons:

Their use can be justified after their deployment because of the misapprehension that they are incapable of injuring people. Allowing the met to use them whenever they please could potentially mean that instead of kettling protests, they wheel out the water cannons because they are ""safe"" method of crowd control. This would make it much more difficult to guarantee the safety of people who want to peacefully assemble, and this in itself is a very un-democratic solution to the problem of violent civil unrest, which happens *very* rarely and which the met is already capable of dealing with.

The comparison of water cannons and baton rounds is not very apt for this argument. Baton rounds have never been seen in the same light as water cannons are currently viewed. They are bullets. Very few people think that the police should *shoot people* just because their protest seems a bit rowdy. People actively advocate for the use of water cannons in these circumstances, because (as I've previously described) they seem safe, and not at all dangerous.

Furthermore, having never used baton rounds, why do the met want the ability to use water cannons whenever they want? They are already able to request their use from the Home Office.

If, like you implied, baton rounds and water cannon are so analogous, why is it that they are pushing for water cannons? Why are the not content being able to use the (according to you) very similar baton rounds?

The reason is that, as I've said at least twice, water cannons are an easy sell to people. You can say ""it's just a bit of water"", and people believe it. People aren't aware of the damage these machines can do, so if the met wanted to, say, disband a protest because they were in the way, they could wheel out the water cannons, blast the protesters, claim that they were breaching the peace and afterwards say ""We only used water cannons to move them, so nobody was injured because water cannons are *safe*""

Nobody claims the same things about baton rounds, because the general public was much more skeptical when they were granted those powers, and are now much more aware of the deadly potential of baton rounds. The same cannot be said about the perception of water cannon. ",0,1392748792,null,0,false,0,cfihlgk,t3_1y8at6,t1_cfihlgk,t1_cfigmam,null,1432452280,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;What on earth gives you that impression? I clearly mentioned my discomfort with being sat next to someone convicted of murder by chopping someone else's head off - I'm not sure that applies to petty burglary or fraud. 

Because you've drawn the line where someone can or can not be trusted to not fake rehabilitation arbitrarily as far as I can see. 

&gt;Given the nature of the crime and their motives for doing it - do you really see them as successfully rehabilitating back in to society? Or any of the people who have murdered and killed in such cold blood?

Do you believe our justice and prison system is flawless and that anyone who does not come out the other end totally rehabilitated we should not even have bothered trying to rehabilitate, and instead should just have locked them up and thrown away the key?  Because I'm getting the impression that's what you believe at the moment.

&gt;Not necessarily - I didn't mention the victims families, someone else mentioned that.

My mistake, sorry.  Still, it's not much of a justice system if we allow someone who commits a crime worthy of life imprisonment to leave the country and be a free man elsewhere, is it?

&gt;Well if the result is not having to share the streets with people who think it's OK to murder other people - I can't say I have an issue with that. 

Can you show me those results beyond the ""theory"" that it should work like that?  Is a rehabilitated murderer who doesn't think what he did was in anyway acceptable still considered someone who ""thinks it's OK to murder other people?""

&gt;It's almost as though you're sticking up for the criminals here... which I just can't fathom.

I am.  I'm not saying they should all be released.  Just that they should not be locked up for the rest of their lives *with no possibility of parole*.  To me, that just seems like psychological torture that is of no benefit to society.  They might be criminals, but they are still humans.

&gt;  These are people who shrug off the way society operates in favor of abduction.. rape.. torture.. murder.. those are some of the reasons that those serving life sentences are currently in prison. What will you say in their defense?  Why should they be allowed to share the same streets as those they have preyed on in the past?

Because our justice system was not based on revenge and that once someone can return to society and be a productive, law abiding member, it serves no one any good if they are kept in prison, except those derive pleasure from others' suffering.",0,1392749907,null,0,1392750535,0,cfii5he,t3_1y8dhq,t1_cfii5he,t1_cfih89l,null,1432452541,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; Are deflation and depression empirically linked? No, concludes a broad historical study of inflation and real output growth rates. Deflation and depression do seem to have been linked during the 1930s. But in the rest of the data for 17 countries and more than 100 years, there is virtually no evidence of such a link.


Of course I don't expect you to go through it. But, the evidence is there if you ever need it.

Why you want to force people to use a monopoly currency that is controlled by bankers and government is very odd to me. I think their actions show they are, at best, economically deranged idiots, at worst a bunch of psychopaths. One of us is missing something here ...

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Because you've drawn the line where someone can or can not be trusted to not fake rehabilitation arbitrarily as far as I can see. 

It's a valid concern in any system that relies on observation of a person to determine intent - but so much more so when the criminal is a convicted murderer, don't you think? Of course there's a developed system that can try to determine the sincerity of someones rehabilitation but this isn't 'A Clockwork Orange' - there is no 100% guarantee. 

&gt; Do you believe our justice and prison system is flawless and that anyone who does not come out the other end totally rehabilitated we should not even have bothered trying to rehabilitate, and instead should just have locked them up and thrown away the key? Because I'm getting the impression that's what you believe at the moment.

I believe there are some crimes so severe that there's a public good in keeping the criminal involved away from society. We'd flatter ourselves to think we can prevent everything, wouldn't we? Evidently there are still criminals and so our success rate in educating against crime in the first instance is flawed.

&gt; Still, it's not much of a justice system if we allow someone who commits a crime worthy of life imprisonment to leave the country and be a free man elsewhere, is it?

Assuming they *were* a free person. Why not hand them over to the custody of the country from which they came? Murder (for example) is a crime in most if not all countries I believe... 

&gt; I am. I'm not saying they should all be released. Just that they should not be locked up for the rest of their lives with no possibility of parole. To me, that just seems like psychological torture that is of no benefit to society. They might be criminals, but they are still humans.

What gain is there for society in general - the same society that they're a threat to - to allow them anywhere near it? That's like saying you can't ever expel the naughtiest children from a school because they're still human. So what? If they can't function to a basic level (and we're not asking much here by saying ""please don't rape and kill people""), they shouldn't be included.

Assuming of course that they can. If you've killed ten people in separate incidents I'd say you're pretty committed to *not* being a productive law abiding member of society. ",0,1392751348,null,0,false,0,cfiivao,t3_1y8dhq,t1_cfiivao,t1_cfii5he,null,1432452880,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,TheDrCK,null,null,"I would start with the caveat that I'm unfamiliar with the criteria against which these databases were established; it's possible that all practices were solicited for involvement, and that only a proportion opted to participate. 
While certainly true that required sample sizes are often smaller than many people realise, these databases aren't established for a particular analysis in mind, but instead cater to a broad range of potential research opportunities. 

As a quick example, let us imagine that a researcher was looking to investigate the efficacy of an anti-diabetic drug specific to young diabetics. It is possible that, of the the 3.7m patients sampled by THIN, only 200,000 are aged under 30 (most contact with primary care services occur at the extremes of age), of these about 2% will have T1 or T2 diabetes, leaving 4000 people, of whom perhaps a quarter (n=1000) might have been prescribed the specific drug of interest. If running a longitudinal analysis, power is then influenced by the incidence of the outcome under study, whatever that might be. As a result, depending upon the prevalence of the factors under study, it's very easy to find yourself with modest samples ; it's unlikely you'd ever analyse the entire 3.7m in a single analysis.

For me, the onus to establish a priori aims rests on those who designed the diabetes *study*; the publication of a clear protocol prior to undertaking a study ensures that researchers don't alter their analyses a posteriori so as to fit their original hypotheses. When establishing a *dataset*, variables available are often broad so as to cater to a range of competing demands made by health researchers, all balanced against the funding available.

An additional factor to consider is reproducibility. This is an important consideration when determining the likelihood of causal mechanisms: can findings be repeated in different populations? As a result, it's always in the interest of scientists and patients to have as many high-quality databases available as possible.

There's no guarantee that the linkage of primary and hospital data will provide real-world benefits, but I consider it highly likely: the data would permit researchers to investigate not just the quality of service provision, but undertake all-important comparative effectiveness analyses of treatments and interventions right across the health system with minimal effort or expense.

Take the Whitehall dataset. Although originally established with the intention of investigating the determinants of civil servant mortality, the breadth of subjective and objective health data available within the dataset was such that hundreds of diverse studies have since been been published -- from the effect of organisational restructures upon mental health, to the impact of smoking and alcohol consumption on cognitive decline in old age.

&gt; I think their actions show they are, at best, economically deranged idiots, at worst a bunch of psychopaths. 



Also please, I read 50 page papers on quantum mechanics on a day to day basis, 14 pages on economics is a doddle (another insult from you there by the way). And what I take from reading that paper is a number of things. 

Firstly it seems mainly to be a very simple statistical analysis. They simply ask the question ""How many times has deflation correlated to inflation"" and don't provide too much theory or explanation as to why the results they find are the case or if they think they are valid now. This is apparent in the abstract where the only real conclusion is that the 2 are not empirically linked.

Secondly, most of the data they use is over 50 years old (because we haven't seen this more recently) and so direct comparison with today's economy's is tough.

Finally, I just took the time to google what free association was and see that you are an anarchist/communist/marxist. In that case I have to agree, of your 3 ideas deflation, competing currencies and free association, deflation is the best idea......... but thats not saying much.

On the bleakest level I spent days on websites that directly outline suicide, reading about people who have attempted it and why they failed etc.

Not all of the issues with the internet and suicide are so obvious as well, with things like facebook, twitter, and to a lesser extent reddit, I was under the impression that I was having enough social interaction with friends/other people, but in reality this really isn't the case. It is so easy to become trapped in a world without any the backup that you get from face to face interaction.

I'm really happy to see that more work is being done through the internet, especially with samaritans who have a just amazing level of online presence. 

For all people that may read this and are dealing with these issues, I know just reading this wont change much for you, but there are so many organisations and people out there who really want to help, but without you taking the first step they aren't able too.

Ashley Cole has been regarded for the better part of the last decade as the best player at his position. Even leading up to this year, there was little doubt as to who the best player was at the LB position. After his injury earlier this season, Azpilicueta has played very well and Cole doesn't look like he will win the starting place back. So, what to do?


I believe that a player doesn't go from being at the top of his game to just a bench player over a span of months. Cole is still capable of playing against the best competition and shutting them down. With the stable center back play in the Chelsea back line, I believe that Cole should be put back in the side and Azpilicueta moved to the right side. I like Ivanovic there, but with David Luiz's erratic center back play, I think Ivanovic should be part of a rotation in the center. This would mean that Azpili and Cole cover the flanks and Cahill JT and Ivanovic play in the middle. With Ivanovic only just turning 30, he will continue to be part of this back line for the foreseeable future. Ashley Cole still has much to give and needs to be part of this team if we are serious about the title run for the 2014/15 season as the manager has stated.",0,1392753320,null,0,false,0,cfijuzg,t3_1y98cw,t1_cfijuzg,t3_1y98cw,null,1432453346,20,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,20

The problem with trying to understand Doctor Who across so many years is that he's pretty much doing the same thing all the time; saving the universe.  But sometimes he does it on a smaller scale.  It really depends on what you like to watch.  Do you like comedy?  Action?  Classic sci-fi?

If you have time, I'd pick an episode from each of the Doctor's regenerations and do a sample.  Try this.

it really is pretty disturbing you cant grasp that the unique political vulnerabilities of a state based on geolocation and trading rights/relationships is unique to each country.

Also you don't seem to  quite understand how a country going from a high operating cost to self sufficiency overnight is not the same as a tin pot republic with a more primitive existence.

likewise all the other countries have long established reputations to trade off , and were not set up overnight, but scotland has been completely supported by the UK for the last 300 years (the world is very different since then).

how do you not understand that a sudden need to build an armed forces for example is a massive one off cost that countries like you mentioned have had split over decades


I dont think you know very much at all about country expenses and investments, and the statistical reality i mention is very very present and real within that.

&gt;Also you don't seem to  quite understand how a country going from a high operating cost to self sufficiency overnight is not the same as a tin pot republic with a more primitive existence.

&gt;likewise all the other countries have long established reputations to trade off , and were not set up overnight, but scotland has been completely supported by the UK for the last 300 years (the world is very different since then).

&gt;how do you not understand that a sudden need to build an armed forces for example is a massive one off cost that countries like you mentioned have had split over decades

You have suggested social and civil anarchy. I haven't even given my option on independence once! 

Has Montenegro collapsed as a country yet?

Scotland isn't a UK subsidiary by any stretch of the imagination and hasn't paid in less in more than a hundred years. The infrastructure is mostly in place and to suggest something like defence is an issue is laughable. 

If the Scottish tax money that goes to current UK defence spending was spent in Scotland then it would be more than sustainable. The defence argument is that moronic that even Alastair Darling has went off it! Do you seriously think that a defence program would be an issue? After a yea votes our allies would undoubtedly provide cooperation since it's clearly in their interests to not have a neighbour attacked.

The defence explanation is one of the parts of the white paper that the SNP never fucked up!

Education and health are two big areas already run from Scotland.

Deficit will go down - Borrowing costs will go up

&gt; it's pretty backwards compared to lots of worldwide metro systems

It's also a lot larger than most of the other metro systems in the world.

&gt; trains stop early

They only stop for a few hours a night and if they didn't then the essential cleaning and maintenance work wouldn't get done.

Every night, the entirety of all of the tube lines are walked by track walkers once the power has been cut so they can check for faults, damage etc. They also repair lots of small faults and do some engineering work in the downtime.

Also during the downtime ""fluffers"" are employed to literally vacuum the tunnels - this picks up the waste hair, litter, dirt etc that is dropped by the 4 million customers every day. If they didn't do this then there is a risk this debris could catch fire and cause a major incident.

&gt; huge swathes shut at weekends

If this downtime didn't happen at weekends, when the majority of the tube is currently quiet, then most of the major engineering works on the tube would never happen.

During the 1960s/70s/80s/90s very little was invested into the tube, and as a result maintenance suffered. The decision was taken when LUL was formed to do the weekend work, every weekend, for years on end, in order to prevent the total collapse of the network due to the lack of maintenance. 

So, in short, it's either weekend work or no tube. They chose weekend work.

&gt; hugely overcrowded.

The work they are doing now on most lines should allow for capacity increases to alleviate the current congestion, and the hope is that the new crossrail project will add in more capacity for the future.

Multiple deprivation is tremendously strongly associated with suicide, and large parts of Northern Ireland are among the most deprived in the UK. 

While there may be a substantive argument to be made about the ""legacy of Provo violence"" on Northern Ireland, this article fails to do so because the author is striving to score as many points as possible on SF (wandering off to discuss 30-year old claims of electoral fraud and lambasting the IRA for their failed independence campaign) rather than unpicking these issues. 

Indeed, even the sources referenced by this article don't try and claim suicide rates in N. Ireland are all about the Troubles, and suggest a whole raft of other possible factors.

&gt; Firstly it seems mainly to be a very simple statistical analysis. They simply ask the question ""How many times has deflation correlated to inflation"" and don't provide too much theory or explanation as to why the results they find are the case or if they think they are valid now. This is apparent in the abstract where the only real conclusion is that the 2 are not empirically linked.

Economics is a value-free science. You don't need to provide theory or explanation, you just show what is.

The major claim for central banking is that it will ease the boom and bust cycle. Central banks make the claim inflation is a vital instrument for controlling that cycle.

It is easy to check if those claims are true, and ... the biggest booms and busts the world has ever seen have happened under the control of central banking.

&gt; Secondly, most of the data they use is over 50 years old

I am not an economist either, but i would guess older data is better as it has been over 40 years since the world left the gold standard, meaning during that time the market was freer so the data should be more accurate.

&gt; Finally, I just took the time to google what free association was and see that you are an anarchist/communist/marxist. 

I am not any of those things, they are all coercive ideologies that are very insular in nature. If you challenge any anarchist/communist/marxist on free association you quickly see they only want it on their terms. I am for free association with the acceptance that values are subjective. Live how you want, but don't try and force me to live the same way.

&gt; In that case I have to agree, of your 3 ideas deflation, competing currencies and free association, deflation is the best idea......... but thats not saying much.

The state pension isn't like a private pension, there isn't a pot of money with your name on it waiting for you to retire. Currently, the UK government is directly paying for all today's pensioners, out of taxation and other sources of income.

If we go our separate ways, then Scotland would have to pay for its own pensioners, and rUK would have to pay for their own. All things being equal, that isn't a problem, the country has split into two groups, each looking after its own pensioners, business as usual.

Unfortunately, Scotland has a disproportionate amount of pensioners compared to rUK, so it is going to be harder for them to provide pensions.

But if they become a separate country, that is the way it is. If they wanted to continue pooling pensions with rUK, that would mean the Scottish people would have to pay a certain amount of taxes to either the UK government or some other institution, who would then pay everyone's pension. But that isn't really independence, it would be a bizarre arrangement.

And for rUK, what would be the incentive for us to pool pensions with a separate country who are taking more out of the pot than they are paying in?

I see nothing about a tax rebate for private medical insurance, in fact I pay more tax due it as it's a benefit from work.  Emergency services are a small part of the cost, far more will be spent in the hospital.

Some people contribute nothing at all, yet still receive the same services as those paying £10,000's a year.

   But, during the 60's and the 80's, he was popping up too often after awhile, and became the go to villain for the writers of those times. And, since Moffat grew up watching those episodes, he probably got quite sick of seeing The Master in episode after episode and now can't stand the thought of the character. 

To Moffat, The Master is like that food item you ate too much of as a kid and then got sick and now you can't stand that food. It's a shame that he won't give out any of that food to others who do like that item.

The problem is the stupidly tight regulation system in some areas which si stupidly lax in others - if the government let the TOCs do their job and actually run railways the way they want to, I'm sure a lot of the problems would go away.

Right now track repairs are done by contracting companies who report to Network Rail, whose customer is the government. If this was changed so that Network Rail's customers were the TOCs then they would have to do what the TOCs wanted - better repairs faster for less cost, new routes or route upgrades/shortening etc rather than doing repairs only when the track fails to meet safety standards any more, and building fatuous new extensions that are only good for spending tax money on, and for gathering more tax once they are complete.

And train length extensions should be handled by the TOCs as well - the government should impose minimum standard service levels, sure, but not ""exact"" ones that limit the ability of TOCs to do their job.

And the franchise system is ludicrous as well. It just encourages TOCs to plan for the near future and not beyond - they can't decide that they need new trains in 10 years if they don't know whether or not they will have the route to put the trains on.

In the 1930s it was the job of the TOCs to build the trains, and they did a good job of it - we hold the world steam speed record for a reason. The railways spent massive amounts of money on R&amp;D, looking into things as diverse as the best grade of steel to use on train tyres (and they do have tyres) through to the most economical blend of linen for table and sleeper services. They basically looked into almost everything needed for modern life, and much of their innovation was used by the general public.

Now, TOCs use whatever they are given by the train design companies and the government committees.

When you pay medical insurance, it gets offset against your gross income in PAYE. For the rest, see 'social contract'. Do you really want a US-style healthcare system?

Some quick info for people  


**What it is**

GP practices nationwide will soon be required to supply patients' personal and confidential medical information, on a regular and continuous basis, to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, GP practices have no choice but to allow the HSCIC to extract this information.  



**Will doctors or my medical staff have access?**
No  



**What information will be extracted from my medical records ?**

The data extracted - your Primary Care Dataset - will include the following:

Your NHS number  
Your date of birth  
Your postcode  
Your gender  
Your ethnicity  
The date you registered with your GP surgery  
Your medical diagnoses (including cancer and mental health) and any complications  
Your referrals to specialists  
Your prescriptions  
Your family history  
Your vaccinations and screening tests  
Your blood test results  
Your body mass index (height/weight)  
Your smoking/alcohol habits  



**Will it be a one-off upload of my data ?**

No.

Your GP data will continue to be uploaded, initially on a monthly basis, and added to the CES, effectively updating it. So any new diagnoses, medication prescriptions and results will be automatically uploaded and added to your care.data record at the HSCIC.



**Who will have access to my uploaded data ?**

Information from your care.data record will be made available to organisations both within the NHS, such as NHS commissioning bodies (e.g. CCGs), but also outside of the NHS, such as :

Pharmaceutical companies  
Health charities  
Universities and other academic organisations  
Hospital trusts  
Medical Royal Colleges  
Information intermediaries  
Think-tanks  
Commercial companies  
Insurance companies  



**How much will organisations have to pay to get hold of my personal data ?**

It depends on the format of your data.  

The full HSCIC price list - the ""menu"" - is here.  

Aggregate data (Green), published on the HSCIC website as ""Open data"" is, obviously, free.  

A statistical table of aggregate data (Green) costs approx. £800 - £1200.  

Pseudonymised (Amber) data extracts cost approx. £900 - £1800.  

Personal confidential data (Red) extracts cost approx. £1700 - £2000.  

Certain PCD (Red) extracts can cost as much as £12000.  ",0,1392760149,null,0,1392763110,0,cfingjh,t3_1y9dwi,t1_cfingjh,t3_1y9dwi,null,1432455043,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The talk of LvG and Prandelli is really impressive when you take a step  back though.

If you had said to a Spurs fan 10 years ago that, as fans, we would be arguing the pros and cons of LvG or Prandelli as a manager people would have openly laughed in your face.

In October of 2008 when we hired 'Arry if you had said that we would be talking about hiring LvG or Prandelli in 2014 you still would have had people laugh in your face.

Look how far as a club we have come that we can even be mentioned with managers with the status of LvG, Prandelli, De Boer, Luciano Spalletti, Capello, Hiddink and others.....its really fucking amazing that these managers can be spoken about with us and most fans (not just of Spurs) can actually see any of them as a possibility.

Some quick info for people  


**What it is**

GP practices nationwide will soon be required to supply patients' personal and confidential medical information, on a regular and continuous basis, to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, GP practices have no choice but to allow the HSCIC to extract this information.  



**Will doctors or my medical staff have access?**
No  



**What information will be extracted from my medical records ?**

The data extracted - your Primary Care Dataset - will include the following:

Your NHS number  
Your date of birth  
Your postcode  
Your gender  
Your ethnicity  
The date you registered with your GP surgery  
Your medical diagnoses (including cancer and mental health) and any complications  
Your referrals to specialists  
Your prescriptions  
Your family history  
Your vaccinations and screening tests  
Your blood test results  
Your body mass index (height/weight)  
Your smoking/alcohol habits  



**Will it be a one-off upload of my data ?**

No.

Your GP data will continue to be uploaded, initially on a monthly basis, and added to the CES, effectively updating it. So any new diagnoses, medication prescriptions and results will be automatically uploaded and added to your care.data record at the HSCIC.



**Who will have access to my uploaded data ?**

Information from your care.data record will be made available to organisations both within the NHS, such as NHS commissioning bodies (e.g. CCGs), but also outside of the NHS, such as :

Pharmaceutical companies  
Health charities  
Universities and other academic organisations  
Hospital trusts  
Medical Royal Colleges  
Information intermediaries  
Think-tanks  
Commercial companies  
Insurance companies  



**How much will organisations have to pay to get hold of my personal data ?**

It depends on the format of your data.  

The full HSCIC price list - the ""menu"" - is here.  

Aggregate data (Green), published on the HSCIC website as ""Open data"" is, obviously, free.  

A statistical table of aggregate data (Green) costs approx. £800 - £1200.  

Pseudonymised (Amber) data extracts cost approx. £900 - £1800.  

Personal confidential data (Red) extracts cost approx. £1700 - £2000.  

Certain PCD (Red) extracts can cost as much as £12000.

3. Demichelis was sub-par for me when he was playing, and made a foolish tackle. It wasn't a penalty but the ref had to give it from where he was stood. Demichelis knew that. He was an idiot who thought he had a better chance of fixing Messi breaking than Hart. That's hubris, and stupid.
4. We did remarkably well in the remaining 36 minutes of being down to 10 men.
5. Shots-wise we gave them a run for their money through most of the match
5. The last 10 minutes was where it really showed we had done all the running, they hadn't, and they were 11 men (or was it 12?) vs our 10
5. We conceded 19 fouls. That's insanity.
6. With a little fixing in the middle field and Aguero fit I think we could win an away leg. By 3 goals? Probably not. But we can dream.

I have been doing this for 20 years and have a worldwide network of collectors/suppliers/dealers and reckon I could make it into a great business. 
If successful I may expand into other associated areas which I have knowledge of such as celebrity memorabilia.
I will need a business account and ability to trade internationally anywhere in the world. For the first year I expect my turnover will be well below the VAT threshold so I will start as not VAT registered and will only register when it looks like this will be exceeded (most of my customers will be individual collectors, not businesses). I already have an accountant, he is xxx yyy .""
You will get a business bank account provided you do not ever mention the word ""Bitcoin"". From time to time the bank may invite you for a chat , ignore/decline these request which are really intended just to sell you something, in reality they have very little interest in what you are doing. 

During your first year of autograph trading you decide to branch out into other areas of business, i.e. buying and selling of Bitcoin. There is no obligation to tell the bank you have diversified your initial business plan.

Keep comprehensive records so that if any inquiries are made you can prove you were simply bitcoin trading and not money laundering.

true,ctp95,lfc55,,"They have a few things going for them. Their scouting network is excellent, varied and deep. It's no accident that they found Messi or managed to pip Madrid for Neymar. They see these guys early on and they move decisively (although maybe too decisively where Neymar is concerned...)

They also have a tactical/technical approach that is consistent throughout all levels of their organisation. They don't do it as much these days but the tiki-taka style, or at least the quick pass and move style, is taught to them from the earliest possible age. By the time they get anywhere near the first team it's literally second nature for all of them. 

Spain also has a very strong league for their reserve squads to play in. The ""B"" team El Clasico is as well attended as many lower-table PL games or top level Championship matches. Basically, their top youth products can get top level experience without even being loaned out or taking up a first-team position. 

Lastly, they're very judicious in terms of who they loan out. Gerard Delofeu is a good example of this. They loaned him not so much to Everton but to Roberto Martinez who emphasises a strong technical style. They wouldn't loan their players to sides who they didn't think have a good chance of improving that player's ability to fit Barca's style and technique. 

Basically, if we or any other English side wanted to build a network like this we would need to start looking for players all across the world at a young age, instil a certain ethos from the U-10 youth squad to Luis Suarez and be a bit more cautious in who we loan guys to. I'm really pleased that Rodgers loaned Suso and Ilori to Spanish sides rather than non-technically minded Championship sides. No knock on those types of teams, but I'm glad players like them are being drilled in a more technical, counter-attacking minded league. 

Man City are working on all of this right now, it's why they hired two ex-Barcelona executives and are expanding their academy so rapidly. However, I think in this sense we've gotten more lucky with Brendan then we realise. He has such a distinct and effective style that it really can be taught at all levels with continuity, so I'm really excited to see what youth products come through during his tenure.

You do realise that there is no ""pension pot"" to share, don't you? Pensions are funded through taxes levied on the working population. After independence, iScotland will need to fund it's own pension scheme from its own taxes - that's what Brown is trying to explain.

In the same way, ""The Pound"" is not an asset to be shared in the manner of a CD collection, but rather a vehicle that requires constant input to steer. The recent statements from the three major political parties were simply making the point that iScotland would no longer have any influence over that process, being a foreign country and all that.

Salmond is trying to cherry pick the juicy bits about independence without taking on any of the difficult stuff - ~~like paying money every week to his pensioners.~~

It only depends on the number of years you've paid national insurance. So who gets to pay for a Scot that worked most of his life in London and is now enjoying his pension in Spain.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"No that isn't the point. The state pension doesn't exist as a pot of money that is paid out - instead, the government pay it directly from taxation. i.e. you and me paying our taxes this month, will be paying towards pensions going out this same month.

So ultimately, the rUK will be liable to pay the state pensions of its own citizens - but any requirement to pay Scottish citizens will fall onto the new Scottish state. Per your above, the Scots would also have to take a ""share"" of responsibility for paying overseas pensions to... because pensions are a liability, not an asset. 

Why is that a problem you might ask? The Scottish can surely pay them with their new share of money? - Not necessarily. In the rUK about 16% of people work in the public sector... but in Scotland it is closer to 28%. So for every pensioner (per capita) the rUK has to pay, this new iScotland will have to pay nearly 2. It is going to be VERY expensive. Bear in mind that pensions accounted for 8% of all Government spending in 2013. Infact, we spent more on Pensions than we did on the NHS, education, defense or the welfare state. It is the single largest item of expenditure on the governments books.

The real message though, is that it is yet another example of how a much larger state like the rUK can absorb the impact of independence - but the small and unestablished Scottish state has a lot of unknowns to deal with - and it doesn't have the size or economy to absorb those shocks. That isn't to say they can't become independent and can't be successful... but it does mean they shouldn't expect those things to happen overnight. The much more likely reality is that independence will cause a lot of short-mid term problems. Only with careful economic management, political buildup and development will the state recover.

fun game to watch met many other City fans today here in Austin.
Even if we can't beat barca 3-0 at Camp Nou, we will still have a chance at three trophies at the end of the season.

Overall we played well enough to draw, hopefully we will play well enough to win 2-0 and then beat them at Penalty kicks or something like that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Best I can figure is that people get peeved that he doesn't write female perfectionist escapist characters like a lot of popular writers.

Actually, that's not the problem.

The real problem is that Amy spent her *entire* time being defined by the man she was in love with, with a brief interlude where she tried to have her way with the Doctor.

And take River Song. She was a little vague, in her first story. Then she simply *had* to be the Doctor's spouse. Oh, and she's in the ultimate prison, but she just walks out any time she's needed for an adventure, because she's just that amazing.

You said ""people get peeved that he doesn't write female perfectionist escapist characters"" but I have no idea how you can watch the show and fail to realize that River is supposed to be a ""perfect escapist character"", not to mention being a literal perfect escape artist.

And then Moffat went on to create Clara - who was amazingly ""impossible"" and was ""born to save the Doctor"" - all of which was the result of yet another time travel paradox.

&gt; Which, love him or hate him, RTD REALLY REALLY wrote exactly what the fans (the fanfiction reading kind of fans) wanted in terms of the character development and relationships, and as a result that filled in with a lot of Mary Sue/Marty Stu sorts of tropes and made a lot of it feel one dimensional, in my opinion.

Between Clara ""impossible, born to save the Doctor"" Oswald and River ""omnipotent time traveling super-hero who knows the end of every story in advance"" Song, I'm pretty sure that Moffat is at least somewhat familiar with the Mary Sue concept.

&gt; Please please please instead of just downvoting me because you disagree, explain your thoughts and opinions because I genuinely want to know why people hold this opinion.

To be fair, RTD had issues, too, and I wasn't impressed that Rose and Martha both had to be defined by their romantic love for the Doctor. But while Rose and Donna both had a brief super-power injection, unlike Clara, that didn't define their story, and at least for Donna, it caused a tragic loss.

RTD was not perfect, but I found his stuff less objectionable. And when Moffat took over, I expected *less* of the ""companion is a super-hero"" stuff and less of the ""of course everything can be resolved with a paradox"", not more of that. I was disappointed that Moffat took the worst of RTD's stuff, and amplified it.

If you are advocating a drastic change from orthodoxy then **you** need to explain it, you can't just make proclamations and expect people to see your genius. Explain to me what the implications of people being free are then?

&gt;  I am for free association with the acceptance that values are subjective. Live how you want, but don't try and force me to live the same way.

Lovely sound bite, would you care to explain how this works in practice? Lets say how I want to live is in a society with a centralised, inflationary, monopoly currency I take it suddenly your less keen on me living how I want? 

Also how do large speculative projects requiring huge co-operation and investment with no guarantee of return get funded/done in this society of yours? (eg. Space exploration, pure science)

&gt;I have no problem with name calling if it comes with a good argument.

I'd say there are some good arguments in this post, does that mean I get a free pass to insult you? Or does this rule only apply to your insults?",0,1392767402,null,0,false,0,cfir1pu,t3_1y89dp,t1_cfir1pu,t1_cfimbo1,null,1432456800,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  I know that the episodes are numbered weird, and not all of them are there

There's a large number of missing episodes. But because the stories were often 6-episode 20-minute episodes, there's a comparatively small number of stories missing. The worst is that most of #2 has been lost.

AFAIK, everything that's still available has been released.

&gt; so I was wondering which Doctor I should start on

Pick a story that you have available, watch it. Move on to the next that you can find.

There was never any real story-arc that lasted longer than a single 6-part episode (well, except for the 6th doctor's Trial of a Timelord season) so there's no *real* reason to wait til you get the perfect order. Also, the lack of a season-long arc means that a missing story from the middle of a season never causes you to miss part of a bigger story.

At worst, the occasional ""I miss companion X"" at the beginning of one episode (referring to companion X departing in the previous story) won't mean much to you.

But Ambureon's suggestion (start with #3) is pretty decent. Although personally I liked Hartnell's doctor, so would say watch the first episodes, anyway.

(As a fan, I will admit that the special effects, writing, and acting were certainly a product of their time, and if you watch a few and say ""screw this, it's crap"", I wouldn't blame you.)",0,1392767501,null,0,false,0,cfir3ea,t3_1yaaag,t1_cfir3ea,t3_1yaaag,null,1432456822,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

So the joke is one of the cops is joshing her and he come back is something like ""Whoa &lt;name&gt;, hey my parents couldn't afford to [genetically engineer] me"". It struck me as an amazingly subtle way of doing what sci-fi does which is extrapolate technology.

The show isn't even about that. She just happens to be genetically modified because that's the sort of thing that goes on in this society. That said they did later air an episode where the sort of prejudices involved with gmods played a central point.

At it's core it's a police procedural it's not as straight played as say ""Caves of Steel"" but it's not really mysterious like say Sanctuary or X-Files. I don't mind a police procedural.

Very Awesome Girls Into Nerdy Activities strives to provide an environment to cultivate and encourage people of all ages to embrace their inner geek and let it shine via community service, social functions, and individual endeavors.

To the members of Very Awesome Girls, we embrace all women of conviction, creed, and nerdiness to promote and celebrate the individual spirits who come together to liberate conventional thinking and empower creativity.

Some of the women have kids, and I recently heard some ideas about a group for kids. I hope that works out, but it probably would have a different name more focused on what they would do- it might even be co-ed.  And it's women only because men tend to get a lot of support in a lot of the nerdy communities and having a place where girls can get together and be themselves is more welcoming to some who want to focus on women friends.  We do lots of events within the community with guys, girls, kids, etc and have a lot of support from the community at large.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"There are a number of key factors:

1. Obviously the complete abolition of the department that handles the charges. In Wales the charges were only raising about £21m a year. That sounds like a lot but hire 400 people and that is gone already.

2. The fact general health care costs come down because people will actually take their medicine now. There was previously a large number of people who choose to avoid medication to save the money. This led to increased complications that cost drastically more than the medicine is worth.

3. Doctors prescribe smaller doses now. A lot of medicine courses effectively go down the path do running through this dose and seeing where you get. With smaller doses the patient ends up paying every time. So under the old system the norm was to prescribe more than needed in these cases to avoid taxing the hell out of patients. Doctors will now prescribe exactly what they think is needed and then give more if they need more.

There is an article on this below

http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/should-prescription-charges-brought-back-4053805

Note that the rational for the charges was never to claw money back. It was about the fear that people would take unnecessary prescriptions out. The general rate of prescriptions has not raised out of line with the UK norm in Wales since 2007 which suggests the rational is complete bullshit.

There is also this BBC article below which points out that prescription drugs cost in Wales have fallen to their lowest level in a decade despite an increase in drugs dispensed.

I doubt Cech would like to spend the rest of his career as a bit part player at Chelsea and I can see him moving on but it'd be great to see him tutor Courtois before leaving the club to play elsewhere. He's 32 and could definitely have another 5-6 years at a top level club before moving to the likes of the MLS or back to the Czech Republic.

That is very badly reported. £18 billion is the total which will not be repaid, but the system was specifically designed to be a half-graduate-tax, where a large percentage of people will never repay the debt before it lapses after 35 years. For one thing, anyone who earns less than the median wage, as it currently stands, will never make a single repayment. The actual miscalculation the public accounts committee mentioned is 8%, not the full 35-40%, so that's a shortfall of £4bn.

More annoyingly he just gave the ball back to them every single time, during a period of the game when we couldn't get a touch of the ball. He did this 4 or 5 times.

I actually can't really blame him for the red card. He probably shouldn't have gotten so high up and left himself unable to cover Messi, but it was a rapid counter when we had the ball in their third. Could have happened to a lot of defenders against a player as quick as Messi.

I agree though that when down to 10 we were probably the better team until the last minute, but you cannot blame Hart for that finish. Goalkeeper has to spread his legs wide to cover the goal. I disagree with you about Lescott too. Yes, he's not a ball playing defender. But he can defend. Being good on the ball is a bonus *if* you can fulfil the basic aspect of your role first. The back 4 looked alot less panicked with him in there, unlike in the first half when we seemed to be scrambling all over the place and desperate to clear it anywhere.
