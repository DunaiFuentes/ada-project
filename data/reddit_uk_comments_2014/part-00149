true,badassraver,null,null,"&gt;&gt;Why is he visiting Somalia if he's been granted asylum from that state ?

&gt;Didn't you read the article? He's a journalist reporting news from Africa. Somalia is in Africa in case if you didn't know. 

&gt;He was granted an asylum in 2000, so the area in Somalia where he lived may become safe for him to visit, 14 years is long time after all. Even if the area where he originally lived is still dangerous, there are lots of other areas in Somalia where it is safe for him to visit. His family might live in these areas. I couldn't imagine myself not meeting my own family forever.

&gt;&gt; The same type of scrutiny needs to be applied to Somalian 'refugees' who have made bogus asylum claims through fear that they or their offspring will be subject to FGM yet their parents happen to book a 'girls only' family holiday in the summer to a country next door to Somalia. 

&gt;Where's your evidence of that? Somalis refugees get asylum claim because they're in danger of losing their lives, not losing their clitoris (the latter does get granted but it's not common). 

&gt;We realise FGM is a problem, and we're actively combating this problem. Of course there'll be always someone who has slipped through the net. These type of people are usually hated on by Somalis living in the UK. Some go as far as reporting them to a social worker. This problem is very rare.

Its a generally well respected principle of international law that should you return to the country in which you claim to fear your claim that you will be persecuted is rendered unfounded. 

Where is my evidence of FGM being widespread in the Somali community? Have you not seen recent articles plastered in the media about NHS midwives and school teachers being asked to remain alert to Somalian girls going on family holidays or 'cutting parties'  as they are called. 

Most Somalians that have come to these shores have come through excercising EU treaty rights after they were granted asylum in EU countries with much laxed testing compared to the UK. Namely places likes Holland. 

The question you have to ask is whether Mr Jamal or any other Somalian be willing to live elsewhere or go through 15 minutes of basic questioning,  which by the way,  isn't long enough for his baggage to arrive on the carrasel?  You and I both know that they would choose being questioned everytime! ",0,1401121202,null,0,false,0,chri6xz,t3_26igsc,t1_chri6xz,t1_chrhmyh,null,1433961366,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Again, you are not.  Like I've said, you are merely an **anonymous** poster on the internet.  You can keep claiming otherwise, your words are ample evidence that you are in no way a humanitarian on the side of poor foreign workers.  This is a blatant lie!

""MORE than fourteen years have passed since the unhappy day when the German people, blinded by promises from foes at home and abroad, lost touch with honor and freedom, thereby losing all. Since that day of treachery, the Almighty has withheld his blessing from our people. Dissension and hatred descended upon us. With profound distress millions of the best German men and women from all walks of life have seen the unity of the nation vanishing away, dissolving in a confusion of political and personal opinions, economic interests, and ideological differences. Since that day, as so often in the past, Germany has presented a picture of heartbreaking disunity. We never received the equality and fraternity we had been promised, and we lost our liberty to boot. For when our nation lost its political place in the world, it soon lost its unity of spirit and will.... ""

As you can see Nazism is really about liberty, unity and lifting the spirit of the nation.

I don't get why so many are negative on signing Lallana. He's an excellent player who would definitely improve us. BR seems to like having a British core. That plays a part here too. I know if we were signing Lallana from a European team he'd probably cost £15m. It's annoying but represents the state of the British transfer market today. Of course I would rather we sign someone like Rakitic instead but Lallana is a more realistic option.

Viktor Fischer had a poor season. I doubt we are looking at him right now. He'd be bench material as is. Son I don't know much about. Shaqiri and Kono would both be great signings but neither play Lallana's position. If we were to sign one of them it would surely be in addition to an attacking mid like Lallana.

Who could have predicted such a fine season for Lovren? Even so he'll still probably cost less than we paid for Sakho. I heard £12m was the expected cost.

1. You are female
2. You aren't wearing a helmet

This leads to the potential conclusion that you may be more likely to get hit by a car if you wear a helmet.

Sure that helmet may help in the collision, but it isn't good if it ends up causing more.

Which international law? Even if the prosecution is the reason why he moved to the UK becomes non-issue few years, it isn't reasonable to ask him to return to Somalia because he has started his new life here. He works as a journalist. If he returns to Somalia, can he still work as a journalist? No. His skills for that profession is rendered useless. Also, there's always risk that prosecution may return. If it does return, this time, he might not be so lucky and die before he can escape.

&gt;Where is my evidence of FGM being widespread in the Somali community? Have you not seen recent articles plastered in the media about NHS midwives and school teachers being asked to remain alert to Somalian girls going on family holidays or 'cutting parties' as they are called. 

It isn't widespread but it still does happen. The media has exaggerated it to create an impression that it happens to every girl that goes to Somalia which is blatantly untrue. Like I said, we're actively combating this problem. In fact, we would say this problem is getting smaller as time goes on.

&gt;Most Somalians that have come to these shores have come through excercising EU treaty rights after they were granted asylum in EU countries with much laxed testing compared to the UK. Namely places likes Holland. 

They claimed asylum because their lives were in danger. Any person whose their lives are in danger would rather to apply for an asylum in countries where it's easier to be accepted.

Most of Somalis who applied and accepted in countries like Holland chose to stay there as this was their primary destination until recently where they were subject to [second migration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalis_in_the_United_Kingdom#Secondary_migration). Most of them did not want to migrate but did because the reasons outlined in the wikipedia article linked above.


&gt;The question you have to ask is whether Mr Jamal or any other Somalian be willing to live elsewhere or go through 15 minutes of basic questioning, which by the way, isn't long enough for his baggage to arrive on the carrasel? You and I both know that they would choose being questioned everytime!

Their journeys may have been interrupted in the Netherlands, or they may have had little choice about their destination. As a result, some secondary migration can be seen in the context of the desire to complete an intended migration to the UK.[17]",1,1401125570,null,0,false,0,chrjxvb,t3_26igsc,t1_chrjxvb,t3_26igsc,null,1433962266,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

OP claimed no relief available for rent.  The fact is rent is a legitimate deduction under either self employment or when operating a limited company.  If your limited company is using a portion of your house then it is standard practice to recharge that fair element to the limited co under a rental agreement. (Note that this can have CGT implications down the line in certain circumstances). The director has then received rental income but has the original costs incurred (eg the relevant part of rent, council tax etc) available as a deduction against this rental income, and so has no increase in net income and so no tax increase.  The big difference is that the limited co now has a rental/expenses bill which is justified and deductible against profits, reducing the co's CT bill.  If the entire rent bill is just left in the directors hand, and not through the company's books, then no deduction is available for it against the director's personal income, which is a waste as some of the property is used for trading purposes.",0,1401126037,null,0,false,0,chrk4t7,t3_26h3mx,t1_chrk4t7,t1_chrboxu,null,1433962346,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Manager: Pochettino

Sold: Rose, Lennon and Adebayor.

About our left-back situation, I honestly think that Levy will end up (and hopefully) spend big on a good solid left-back, especially since a lack of one was one of our biggest problems (and arguably what was holding us back from Champions League) last season. Would deifinately prefer Coentrao but Criscito is good as well. Keep in mind, I think we are capable of getting either one of them. I'm particularly optimistic about Coentrao since Man United stand a chance of getting Shaw.

I actually really hope he do get Welbeck. I actually think he and Soldado aren't too far apart in the way they play. Both of them operate much better in a lone striker system and both of them require lots of sexy through balls and passes to keep the goals coming, all the while hanging about and making good runs to receive these balls.

I think its time for Rose and Lennon to leave. They're good against lower table teams but if we want to achieve top 4 we need to aspire bigger and not just be satisfied grabbing points only where expected to. Besides, Zeki looks like he can go pretty far.

Ade should go as well, at least in January. His ridiculously high wage which has been subsidized by Man City up until next season will take up a lot of room in the budget. Players like Coentrao and Welbeck would definitely ask for pretty high wages.

Why Pochettino and not De Boer? I believe Pochettino has more benefits than the other. He's proven himself to turn Southampton, last seasons relatively mediocre squad into a one-to-not-underestimate kind of team who occasionally takes points from the top 4. He speaks fluent Spanish which is important for Lamela and Soldado. And he's shown himself to be good with young players, an asset we do not lack in.",0,1401126723,null,0,1401127098,0,chrkeui,t3_26iwad,t1_chrkeui,t3_26iwad,null,1433962477,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Spain has also yet to release their final 23 squad. Depending on how his recovery goes he might not even make the squad, Spain has too much talent to waste a spot on an injured player and I am sure that unless Costa is recovered or at least some what close to recovery that they might not bring him.

Spain has to submit their final squads by June 2nd, and they were going to release it today but didn't after hearing of the injury news.

&gt;There have been no major terrorist attacks in Somaliland since 2008.

is quite important because that's 6 years ago. [For comparison with Kenya, there were a lot of terrorist attacks between 2011 and 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9314_terrorist_attacks_in_Kenya). 

There was an election in 2010, and that's when anybody would expect terrorist attack to happen but it didn't. Why? Because Somaliland is generally safe.

Somaliland doesn't have al-shabab operating in it. [In fact, Al-shabab doesn't operate anywhere near to it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Somalia_map_states_regions_districts.png). When a Somali goes to Somaliland, it's very reasonable to expect that this person went because s/he has a family or business to do there. There was no known terrorist activity in Somaliland for a long time.

I would say it's safer for Somalis to be in Somaliland than it is to be in Kenya and probably Ethiopia as well.

I couldn't agree less. This is clearly an attack on the EU, and if they don't respond then the voters who are strongly against being in the EU will be forced to vote for numpties like UKIP. 

The current big parties are not in tune with the population of this country.  I'm pro/apathetic-EU and anti UKIP but even I can see what needs to be done. 

The main two parties need to adjust their attitude towards the EU. It's not what I want, but it's what needs to happen. 

You can't just ignore the people like they have been doing. If you do, this shit happens. 

Cameron should call a referendum ASAP, imo. I think enough people would vote to stay in at the moment. 

If Labour wins the next election, and doesn't go ahead with the referendum it'll look like none of the politicians trust the people of this country and it will breed contempt for the EU, with fucking Farage at the helm.

&gt;They have absolutely no authority or meaning at all. They have no official recognition by Muslims. 

[""The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), established in 1997, is a self-appointed umbrella body for 500 mosques, schools and associations in Britain...It has been called the ""best known and most powerful"" of the many organizations that have been founded in the 1990 and 2000s to represent Britain's Muslims.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain). Yes, I know it's Wikipedia, but they are quotes from cited articles. And whilst it's not an official body, it still wields a fair amount of power and influence within British Islam.

&gt;It's just some random group of Muslims.

And the random groups of Muslims I've shown actually doing things - like going on anti-terror marches etc? Are they simply ignored?

&gt;Having an agenda doesn't mean that your data is wrong.

It also doesn't mean that it's right. Have you really never wondered why different surveys often get vastly different answers to very similar questions? Are you really so naive that you simply take every single poll that supports your view at face value without even questioning whether there may be bias in it?

&gt;So you are claiming outright fraud? Then please provide evidence.

I'm saying that we regularly see opinion pollsters get the answers that they happened to be looking for, even where those answers are hugely different to pollsters who want different answers. If you want to do a bit of basic reading on bias (deliberate or otherwise) in polls, you could start [here](https://filipspagnoli.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-31-common-problems-in-opinion-polls/)

true,edvol44,null,null,"&gt;But how to you get to people that don't watch the news, read unbiased newspapers

Well you can start by having better tv news. I'm in America the problem is rampant (you're better off not watching it here, except maybe some late night pbs or cspan), but the bbc still leaves something to be desired even if it is much better than cnn, msnbc, fox, etc. Unbiased newspapers: they have those in the UK (that cover things substantially)? 


""Report on actual reasons why Russia annexed crimea or the implications of Pikkety's work? No let's report on that Malysian plane some more [what if aliens?!? Looking at you cnn] or the kardashian's new sex tape or a rollerblading dog! Maybe throw in some native advetising while we're at it.""

&gt;Remember there is a decent proportion of the right wing media that makes money off this misconception because it makes people scared and it sells papers and ad space

This is admittedly a big big problem, and I am not sure how to deal with it exactly, besides maybe having better non-exclusively right wing news media. Unbiased media would do a lot to deal with this since it would be neither right or left wing. You could also try to get better right wing media as well, though it will admittedly be harder for it to compete with the sensationalist outlets. The right wing does have issues and concerns worthy of discussion, if for no other reason than a lot of people adhere to them, and if those things are left only to the sensationalists to discuss without condescension or straw-man representative, then it will be where a lot of people turn to.


As far as immigration goes, the ""regular"" people deal with the ""regular"" immigrants all the time and on a more personal and real level than the upper classes. They have a better conception of what they view as acceptable levels, etc. than any government statistics do. Just because lying assholes misrepresent the actual numbers doesn't mean that a lot of people don't see current immigration policies as a problem. My reccommendation for that would be to try to curtail immigration for the present and work to better integrate the people that are already there, and then open up immigration again. Calling proponents of that policy ignorant racists (which I have noticed seems a rather common approach) doesn't really help. The right wing is supposed to be the intolerant side, not the left, but the derision with which the right is treated by the left just radicalizes them further as the hypocrisy is plain to see for the right and is very very ugly and very threatening, since largely, the right has long abandoned actual racism and bigotry. A little more understanding and respect on the part of the left wouldn't hurt. I'm not sure how to get that to happen either since it is the rabid assholes on both sides that seem to get defended and given airtime lately. 


You only get short term gains from demonizing the other side unless you destroy them, and the short term policies that usually end up being advocated with/to get the short term gains are nearly always short-sighted. That is the biggest problem in the US right now, and I suspect that it is similar in the UK, despite our differences. I am 27 years old, and as far as I can tell this has been the problem since the reagan administration here (ie my entire life), and has gotten really bad since the first clinton administration (ie my entire life since I started paying attention to national events). Government on both sides has failed the American people, and at the present, the people around my age and younger are totally fucked, along with the rest of the 150 million americans who couldn't come up with $1000 even from a loan on short notice. *That* is the real reason why people don't trust the government. they didn't get lazy, they work hard, but now everybody is out of work or underemployed. In America at least, that doesn't make people super friendly towards general immigration either, even if they are nice to immigrants individually that they encounter. The left paints anybody who wants to curtail immigration as a racist, when really they usually just want a job, or a job that pays a living wage that isn't depressed by cheap immigrant labor. Maybe we could help Mexico and other central american countries more or something. Our politicians give lip service to issues and then sell us out in ignorance or in full knowledge of what they're doing, without throwing a bone to the important issues that the people want now and again, as they did in the past.

&gt;2)Why can't he be journalist elsewhere? There's nothing stopping him.

There are two options in this case. He can stay as a journalist in the UK. He can go to Somalia to be a journalist. The latter almost guarantees him to be killed as Somalia is well-known for killing journalists. Go to somewhere else? Why would he?

&gt;He returns to this country of his own will. Being questioned is a small price to pay given what this country has offered him. 

Bad treatment? Hell no. He works and pay taxes just like everyone else, why should he be treated badly while his colleague were treated well?

&gt;Oh and please stop exaggerating, he has not been 'badly' treated. 

Yes he has. How do I know this? Because I've been subject to the same treatment (see my top comment in this post).

&gt;Has he been interned like Germans of WW2 were? Nope! 

[Strawman...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

&gt;He's from the armpit of Africa and visits that country under the guise of journalism despite claiming to have a fear from it which he was granted asylum. I'd say 15 minutes of questioning was quite generous.

What about me? I was never born and raised in Africa. I did not seek for refugee in any country. I moved to live in the UK because of course I want to live here and work in the UK. I was subjected to bad treatment every time I return from Somalia? What about those Somali born in the UK who were also subjected to bad treatment too? I'm sure there is no difference between Somalis who were born and raised in the UK and native British who were born and raised in the UK.

Danger from journalism in Somalia primarily comes from staying around in Somalia for too long. People don't care if you're a journalist from outside of Somalia. But they DO care if you're from Somalia.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_during_the_Somali_civil_war

Between 2006 and 2014 shows that almost all journalists killed are from Somalia itself despite having many foreign journalists visiting it.

&gt;Furthermore, why doesn't he or any other Somali not use his EU treaty rights and chose any of the number of OTHER EU countries which all the Somalis have come from to examine whether life is better there. Simply because you know the UK is easy pickings. I note your previous posts where you outline that you have lived in other EU countries and that you are Somali. So why have you chose the big bad UK over all these other countries? IF as you say your experience is much better. 

I've lived in multiple European countries and I chose to come here because I know there is less discrimination and I believe I can have better life in the UK than other European countries. I'm sure other Somalis feel the same.

Did you know that moving around in Europe is VERY expensive in terms of financial, man-hours and culture/language adjustment. I doubt any people can afford to do it every year.

&gt;I couldn't agree less. This is clearly an attack on the EU

While we don't have the data yet, I point you to the bastion of reasonable discussion, the benchmark of intelligible debate, the renowned center of objectivity;
http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/politics/a1746949-Any-UKIP-supporters-on-here-What-exactly-are-you-voting-for

Obviously skim read past the batshit, but the point is, although Anti-EU sentiment is seen there, it is small compared to (largely irrelevant) grievances towards national Government policy. 

It was afterall, a Conservative Government which is proposing an In/Out EU referendum. Although I realise trust on delivery is something of a sore point, but even here I would question how many new UKIP'ers realise that we were promised one which was undelivered.

You may at this point wish to point at Frances results. But I would counter, that the biggest gains in Far-Right parties exist in countries where the current national Government is unpopular.

Although there is evidence to support your point;

http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/02/24/where-ukip-gets-its-support/

But even here, EU issues are not rated the most important items. Although you could argue immigration is an EU item easily. At this point I wonder how much immigration is really affecting people nationwide. I can understand the problems for C2DE demographics, but not really elsewhere.

While there is no doubt Anti-EU sentiment in the results, I don't think this can fully account for even half their votes. And for those that it does, it was probably attributed wrongly. Afterall, the British public is wrong about almost everything; www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html

&gt;Cameron should call a referendum ASAP

This idea scares me. Due to recent election victories and poor media coverage, I think people would make ill informed choices. Even having one in the future worries me.

Rose was great under AVB and he has passion for the club. Wouldnt mind giving him another shot under a good manager. Chiriches, Kaboul and Caulker are all interchangeable as a starter. The 4 DMs are all interchangeable and great when actually played as DMs. Kono and Chadli are more of a matchup choice. Example is id play Chadli against Man City because no one is faster than Navas, but Chadli can big body the shit out of him. If we sell Ade and get Lukaku, thatd be great.

He ""fell apart"" because 10 of his players from the previous season were sold. He was also at a club with a small budget in the toughest league in the world, not the biggest club in a weak league. Not to mention, the supporters at Espanyol didn't want him to go. They loved him and thought he was doing a great job, it's the board who received their anger. 

As for the AVB comparisons, besides a somewhat similar playing style I don't understand how they are similar.  

Also, we would need another overhaul of our squad to play De Boer's style, we are much more suited to Pochettino.

Hes done shit in Europe though. Sure he has experience there but realistically you are not talking about a positive experience (so far)

&gt; De Boer is quite a likable guy - ever watched interviews with him?

I have seen interviews with him and im not sure i agree with you actually. He doesnt come across as immediately a particularly personable charachter. Having said that it would be stupid to form an opinion on him based on one or two interviews.

Im not sure that there has been any particularly bad times under De Boer tho so i dont think that this applies. As for AVB, he simply isnt a likeable guy, he comes across as being pretty weird in interviews, the Chelsea players strongly disliked him, he alienated many of the staff who worked at Tottenham (Medical department, Freund), and many journalists - and not just the daily mail crowd - commented on how difficult a person he was to warm to.

I find it hard to see how UKIP could put that into their manifesto, and retain the support of their immigrant-hating base.

This is one of the core tensions at the heart of UKIP's position.

They can't make ""racist"" distinctions that single out ""undesirable"" Romanians etc. specifically (even though many of us suspect they'd like to...), but it's going to be very hard to frame impartial rules that target them without also affecting the ""desirable"" Germans &amp; French.

People avoid tax where possible and the richer you are the more worthwhile it is to avoid tax. 

&gt; our economies are beginning to be torn apart by wealth inequality

Wealth inequality is an inevitable and desirable consequence of capitalism. Reward for effort. Sometimes the system is imperfect but the best way to improve the standard of living for those at the lower echelons isn't to punish those who are successful but to find ways to encourage and promote them to share their wealth effectively e.g. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

&gt; the classical liberal explanation for how capitalism can remedy this has been comprehensively shown to be false in perpetuity by Piketty and his colleague.

Firstly, no it most certainly has not (as all the threads pointing out the Piketty calculation errors demonstrate), but more so because inequality isn't itself the problem. What difference does it make if the super-rich have a lifestyle worth US$100 trillion in today's money if the poorest of the poor have a lifestyle worth US$100 thousand in today's money?

While it is way too blunt, it is also the quickest solution to this problem.

In many areas, the difference in cost between a Band B property and a Band F property is inconsequential. This shouldn't be the case. To help the poor, the lower bands should be significantly discounted, as the occupants are likely the least capable of servicing it.

That said, the effect of implementing this could have unfortunate consequences for the elderly and similar groups.

Which is why we need to tax wealth in the form of property and other tangible assets domestically and intangible wealth through international agreements.

&gt;Reward for effort.

The problem being that wealth and effort hardly correlate at all.  And, even with income, the scientific evidence suggests that money is not a good motivator for all but the most rudimentary, intellectually unengaging and unpleasant of tasks.  Of course, we wouldn't need to redistribute if we instituted an economic system which didn't distribute unfairly in the first place.

&gt;as all the threads pointing out the Piketty calculation errors demonstrate

Can you link to some of the better referenced of these.  I'm no economist, but I did study a bit of economics at university level so I can sometimes see through the more distracting flim-flam and judge if they're actually making any valid points.  Most of the stuff I've read so far (in business and more serious press - Economist, FT etc.) seems to be saying that they basically get it right, with some relatively inconsequential errors and omissions.  And inequality itself most definitely _is_ the problem, since it is inequalities which allow for exploitation.  If we were all millionaires, then none of us would be, but if you and your hundred best mates had billion billion, a substantial number of people had a billion or so, and the rest of us had a million, you'd still be able to drive us to work for you to keep ourselves clothed, fed and housed, you'd still be able to demand personal services from us, and you'd still be able to buy the political process.",0,1401134562,null,0,false,0,chrnmvc,t3_26j2ph,t1_chrnmvc,t1_chrmf8j,null,1433963996,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

No it's not.  They've had teething problems, without doubt, and shown some naivete.  Some, because they're a looser, more diverse coalition than most of the other parties (particularly those parties at a local level), which has led to some infighting; some, because taking advice in trying to handle gender equality in bonus payments and the like, and not being entirely open about it, led to a dispute with city employees which left rubbish on the streets for a couple of weeks (not unlike what has happened in Tory and LibDem councils); and some because going green is not always painless, especially for some widely represented interest groups such as car owners (but it's interesting that a number of their innovations are spreading to other councils now they've been trialed).

Edit:  It's worth noting that - whilst we're talking about bad press - most of the coverage the Greens _have_ got over the last few years, has been in relation to ""fucking up"" in Brighton.

That video is six years old. As I said before, this is a city that changes dramatically from one month to the next, let alone over six years. And Vice is hardly a ""credible news agency"". It is sensationalist tabloid news. They have taken one extreme and illegal case of employee abuse and pretended it is it the norm. Balanced journalism, it is not. 

And I am not expecting you to take my word for UAE's improvements in this regard. I have provided multiple third-party sources that demonstrate that actually labourers are paid, despite what Vice would have you believe.

&gt; From what I can see you are absolutely obsessed with posting pro-UAE propaganda and dismissing all criticisms, no matter where or when those come from, of its government. 

I correct errors where I see them, that is all. I correct them regardless of whether the content is positive or negative. It just so happens that most comments on reddit about UAE are negative, as I have already explained.

&gt;  You can keep claiming otherwise, your words are ample evidence that you are in no way a humanitarian on the side of poor foreign workers. This is a blatant lie!

My words on reddit are just a small sample. I obviously have other outlets, most of which are much more effective at creating meaningful changes.

&gt; What exactly have you ever ""fiercely criticised"" about the UAE?

Some of the main topics I am currently pushing for change are as follows:

* Introducing a minimum wage for workers.
* Reforming the judicial system.
* Providing universal health care throughout UAE.
* Setting up a welfare system to provide income to the unemployed.
* Increasing enforcement of environmental protection law. 

As I say, complaining about these things on reddit would achieve little to nothing. You have to speak directly to those in charge to get anything done in this place.

&gt; Which sources?

US-based economist Michael Clemens wrote a report on migrant workers in UAE in 2013 ([source](http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/seize-spotlight-labor-migration.pdf)). He had this to say:

&gt; First, the economic benefit to migrant workers is extraordinarily and systematically large: migration to the UAE for basic construction work causes their daily wage to rise by a factor of five, and causes employment to rise by at least 20 percentage points. Second, there is no sign that many of the commonly-mentioned costs of migration are systematically experienced by migrants' households; migration to the Gulf causes the fraction of households in debt to sharply decline, and there is no evidence of labor force entry by school-age children or labor-force exit by adult family members. Third, households are generally well-informed about working and living conditions in the UAE, and there is no evidence that they enter into migration systematically overestimating the benefits. Households with migrants give estimates of migrants' income that closely reflect true income in UAE administrative records.

As I keep trying to say, and you keep ignoring, I am well aware that UAE has multiple flaws. I am not denying it has problems. I am not here to defend any abuses, I am simply correcting errors. Even the world's worst criminals deserve a fair trial based on facts.

If you are thinking about London, [have a look at these yields](http://www.londonpropertywatch.co.uk/average_rental_yield.html). You would need a mortgage interest rate of around 1-2% just to break even on the rent you receive. If you have cash, it might make more for you in a savings account and with orders of magnitude less hassle. So buying a house in London really only makes sense if you think it's going to make massive capital gains (which are taxed), and with how sky high prices are that would be quite a bet.

As for elsewhere, I hear that you can buy a house for around £50K in Hull. That seems like a bargain to me, but the rental market demand doesn't seem anywhere near as strong as London. You might have to pay for a bit of work done to the house before it becomes attractive enough to rent out, and you will obviously get less rent. I'm not too knowledgeable about those markets though.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Here's the bottom line for me;

One is yet another foreign manager who is known for playing a system and a specific way who's never yet managed in England; another up-and-coming European manager whose tactics are raved about. He wants a chance to come to England to prove that his system can work at the highest levels of the game.

One is a young, foreign manager who's proven he can get results in England with a lesser grade of players, is tactically flexible (likes to press, but knows when to sit back) but still prefers to play exciting, attacking football. He's not made many waves about moving to a larger club, but there's been lots of speculation about how he'd fare with better players at his disposal.

The first was AVB in 2010.

The second was Roberto Martinez in 2013.

AVB is now managing in Russia after *two* failed stints in the Premier League. Martinez just guided Everton to a top 5 finish and very nearly had them playing in the Champion's League next year.

We've tried the foreign manager who plays ""beautiful"" football but is untested in England; Juande Ramos, AVB, etc. FdB is another manager in that mold. 

We've just watched Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez come in after impressing with attractive football at smaller sides, and make the transition to sides that are pushing for top places, and do very well.

I don't think familiarity with the EPL can be overstated in importance, and Pochettino has experience here. Moreover, FdB's Ajax is built around the concept of ""total football"" where anyone can play just about anywhere; that won't work here, where players haven't been raised in that system; Dawson can't step up into midfield when he needs to; Sandro can't step out wide and cross the ball. Lamela shouldn't be expected to slide back into defense.

Pochettino is everything we want in a manager; he's young, driven, but proven in England, plays attacking football but doesn't beat his head against the wall tactically; he's willing to do what works. As an added bonus, he speaks the native language of our two biggest ""transfer flops"" from last season, Soldado &amp; Lamela; if anyone can get those two firing again, I'd bet it's Mauricio.",0,1401137866,null,0,false,0,chrozua,t3_26jmz1,t1_chrozua,t3_26jmz1,null,1433964636,125,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,125

I don't think UKIP have a formal policy on TTIP, due to the stage of discussion nor the actual relevance atm of TTIP to their political position. Anything of note is still undisclosed in the negotiations.

I would guess an independent UK could negotiation a TTIP deal more expediently than the in the EU. I would also further guess that the ISD could be put to closer democratic scrutiny and opposition by the British public, also.

A deal with the US would be very good bar the complications of the above. I think an independent UK could achieve a good result whoever is in government.

Lobbying in the EU makes that more complicated.

As far as I can make my own opinion up on the matter at this stage.

On the other hand, it's Ajax, not the PL. We want to win now. We may talk about giving a manager a few years to develop, but we've got a lot of expensive investments that we need to see some ROI on now. If Verts, Lloris, Sandro, Paulinho, Lamela, and Eriksen are all going to stick around for another season, it's likely that they won't be around for two more underperforming seasons. And again it's still a gamble. 

Poch, has managed in the PL. Whether his team was or wasn't underrated two years ago, they certainly played attractive football. And now he's got a file folder on each team and a dossier on their managers. He (as a Spanish speaker) could be a good thing for Paulinho, Soldado, and Lamela.  Finally, there is no reason to think that he couldn't be as good with building a total youth&gt;senior development program. 

TL;DR it's a gamble either way, but one has the tools to be a short term AND a long term win.

Halal butchers for chicken, and occasionally other bits like ox tails, lamb, goat - about half the price of the supermarket. Chicken breasts are huge, and half the price per kg. Legs/wings are almost free. Next time you hear someone making the 'fried chicken is really pigeon, how else is it so cheap' joke - it won't seem so cheap once you've gone to the source, seriously!


Lidl for pork - a pack of good pork belly is just above £2.


Sainsbury's for the big pack of cooking bacon. This I cram into a Tupperware and freeze, then bring it out and slice bits off with a good knife - lardons whenever you want them.


I don't buy bacon for sandwiches, or any ham - never see it cheap enough. Bacon as a cooking ingredient seems to satisfy me on that front.


Also, the Tesco's near my work seems completely unable to manage its Halal meat stock levels, and frequently slashes packs of lamb and other great stuff to £1.75.


So, I don't really have an overall cheaper option, but yeah, I don't buy it routinely enough to need one. I believe pork belly is the most bang for your buck you can get. It's almost always very cheap, and is perfectly tender and delicious after 45 mins - 1 hour of cooking.

Sure, but it doesn't justify the bad treatment we received from the agents.

&gt;This is only my opinion and no doubt some people will disagree, but if he wants to enjoy the benefits of living in our country, his adopted country now, he cannot complain about our border security. Yes he has been treated unfairly, but the victimisation in the article makes it seem that nobody else gets stopped at the airport. I have many friends and family who are white British and have been interrogated and patted down and spoken down to etc, I don't like the way he is using his race to claim he is a victim.

Now replace him with someone who is Somali (ethically) and was born and raised in the UK. Is it still a race issue even though he was picked because he was black and Somali? It is. Also, it still doesn't justify the bad treatment we got from the agents.

Also this quote from the article might prove this is a racial issue.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I think their silence on the issue is most telling. 

The 'Investor-State dispute settlement' is a really good argument against the TTIP, and therefore in a way the EU. UKIP have made it clear their view is that it's impossible to reform the EU, and you'd expect that ideology to extend to the TTIP and the Investor-State dispute settlement part. They could, quite rightly, bring up how that clause could force the NHS to be privatised, or how it would further remove sovereignty from the UK. I know it hasn't been passed yet, and there's lots of negotiation to go on, but if the TTIP did get passed in its current form, I think that would be the best argument to leave the EU. As I mentioned, even me, someone with a staunch pro-EU stance, would seriously consider supporting leaving if that were the case.

However, UKIP have been silent on it, silent on what is perhaps the best argument against the EU. For a party that focusses so much on the 'national sovereignty' argument, you'd have suspected them to make a big deal about the TTIP. That suggests to me that they actually support initiatives like that. They couldn't care less about national sovereignty, all they want is what's best for big business. They're essentially misleading their supporters that their intention is to leave the EU to support British workers, whereas all they want to do is support British capitalists and businesspeople, exactly the same as the Tories. 

The TTIP is a ready made argument for UKIP to use. They have gone to much greater efforts to stretch much less significant points to support their ideology and views, so them ignoring the TTIP suggests they couldn't care less about national sovereignty or the non-political elite they claim to represent.

Use yarn that holds it shape well and isn't bumpy. Bumpy yarn will create ridges where you don't want them. I used kinda rough yarn for this because I knew the stitches would have good definition and nobody would be wearing it.

I don't want a lot of turnover in the first team other than bringing in Davies and selling Rose, bringing Caulker back, and bringing in a winger/forward like Tello (not in the 18 first day) to replace Lennon. Maybe selling Siggy if Poch thinks its the right thing to do and someone wants him. Loans out include Bentaleb, Winks, Veljkovic, Pritchard.

By going to Somalia via Ethiopia, you were actively trying to evade border controls (and you admitted as such). There is no way that was going to ever be overlooked or dismisssed.

Given there aren't very many reasons for trying to hide the fact you visited a country from border control agencies, you were always going to be required to explain your actions to them.

The reason Somalia has extra border controls and regular visitors get such tough treatment is because it's a failed state. It has topped the list of most failed states since 2008 : http://ffp.statesindex.org/ . Somalia's border controls cannot be trusted, Somalia's law enforcement can't be trusted. The border control in the UK has to take up these roles in their absence and they have to do this without knowing what happened during your stay.

Somaliland isn't on the banned list, so I should be able to go there if I want. When I was taken to into the interview, they asked me if I went to Somaliland, I answered yes, how is that problem?

&gt;The reason Somalia has extra border controls and regular visitors get such tough treatment is because it's a failed state.

You sound like a broken recorder playing from various news papers blended into single tape.

In all seriousness, I did not go to Somalia. I went to Somaliland which has border controls, has their own passport, currency, etc. It isn't failed state. I can assure you that UK government makes a distinction between Somalia and Somaliland.

Also, for your information, Somalia's biggest airport, Aden Adde International Airport has border controls. This border control is well equipped and trained. [In fact it was trained by Japan.](http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/newsbriefs/2013/01/14/newsbrief-07)

FdB, a student of Ajax, employs a fluid 433 that focuses on holding the ball in the opposition half and consequently relies on good technical ability and thought from the GK position to the lone forward and a powerful, deep central midfield.

Poch, a follower of Bielsa, usually selects a 4231 that demands unrelenting pressure to win the ball high up the pitch and requires an intelligent, youthful, athletic squad with tricky, creative players in the AM band.

Our squad, in my opinion, is well-suited to both of them. In fact, I think we're a near perfect fit for either manager. It's impossible to tell whether or not one would be a better candidate than the other; making these sorts of predictions in soccer is futile. Very few saw Rodgers being this successful or Moyes being this catastrophic. 

I think they are equal in my eyes in terms of how potentially good they can be for our club. We are pretty lucky to have these two be our choices considering the negative image associated with managing Tottenham, that we don't trust managers. It's been said many times before, but more important than the choice between the Southampton man or the Ajax man, is a dedication to the choice and consistency at our helm.

The argument here isnt who is the better player.

&gt;I reiterate my previous point, you have no fucking idea what you are looking at when you watch football.

When you make a point, let alone ""reiterate"" a point. You should support your point with evidence.

The defensive partnership of Sahko and Skrtel has conceded a lot more than Agger and Skrtel. Skrtel/Agger is also the same partnership who provided the the same defensive partnership who provided the best defensive record we have seen in years (daglish reign)

I agree, Sakho is the better player *as of this year*, but Sakho is a long way off being the better captain. 
Sakho is not a ""commanding pysical presence in the box"" the kid can barely head the fucking ball convincingly. If i could be arsed, i'd compile a video of every header he's made this year, and compare it to skrtel. The difference would be light and day. 

There is absolutely nothing about Sakho's play that has even made him close to jumping Skrtel in the queue for being captain. The kids shakey on the ball, can barely compete physically ( was made to look lightweight by fucking Ba) and can't talk the queens well. 

I think its likely you who hasn't got a clue about what it takes to be a captain. ",0,1401141454,null,0,false,0,chrqgcm,t3_26jmrn,t1_chrqgcm,t1_chrq3og,null,1433965331,-5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-5

This is a young squad, and most of the players are versatile (Chadli comes to mind, whether he plays as attacking mid or on the wing, he does a decent job) enough for Total Football (granted, the positional interchange isn't as hardcore as it used to be, which is why Eriksen can play on the left wing despite being right footed and Vert can play left back and defensive mid like scum would've wanted). 

Dembele, Eriksen and Vert don't really need any introduction to FdB's approach, and the others will acclimate eventually. And really, the easiest way to get the best out of Lamela is to give him minutes. He's only played in nine or so matches with us, it's obvious that he's just not used to England.

Martinez has played and lived in England for twenty years. He's far from the exotic foreigner. Rodgers had a ton of experience in the Championship and coaching the Chelsea reserves, too. 

Pochettino's only got a year in comparison.

Take this extremely exaggerated example to give you an idea of how the numbers could be such that wearing helmets are bad.

#**The Rules**
* There's a 1% chance of hurting yourself by falling over
* There's as 1% chance of being hit by a vehicle (assume all collisions are fatal for this shit example).
* A helmet half's the odds of the first, and doubles the odds of the second.


#**The Mathematics**
The chance of something bad happening is ( 1-P^fall ) x ( 1-P^crash ) 

* On any ride without a helmet you have a 1.9% chance of hurting yourself badly
* On a ride with a helmet you have a 2.4% chance of being hurt badly

#**Conclusion**
Depending of the odds of each situation, how much more likely a car crash is going to happen by wearing a helmet and how much a helmet protects you the mathematics **can** end up showing it's worse to wear a helmet.

I don't know what the actual case is. This was just a very rudimentary example to show that it is possible for the numbers to work against helmets.

I think your argument is well made, except I think UKIP would be catching themselves in between a rock and hard-place: Leaving will bring out the economic doomsday apocalypse from the Pro-EU and hence to ""bang on"" (lol inverse of bang on about europe!) about banging down any potential economic windfalls from various FTA's would limit UKIP's armoury in that event. Only if the public awareness of TTIP and ISD grew would it be politically expedient to then ""stand up for Britain/British workers"".

That is why I think they don't bring it up tactically. However, I have to somewhat agree with you that their economics may favor it. I don't know but I tend to see your pov on that, that free market ideology may be their guiding hand.

I certainly would like to see NHS protected. Yet I speak to some people (GP's) and they suggest it must be saved except it's already under immense strain that's not sustainable. What I know is Nuttel has said privatization would be productive, yet Farage has said, he's against it, ie it's a great British success story/institution.

It's complicated! Cheers for a great post too. I have a sneaky suspicion you're right about their economic tendencies.

But I think a deal out of the EU with US would be a huge boon albeit ISD etc needs serious revision.

In my opinion, sakho is the most overrated player in this entire sub.

He's extremely shaky on the ball, makes rash decisions like that absolutely ridiculous challenge on dzeko (I think) which should have been a penalty, yes he's good in the air but do NOT let his ""passing stats"" I've seen thrown around here fool you. He is by no means a baller. 

That article the other day about his passes completed etc was garbage. Yes he consistently finds his team mates feet, but almost always at the expense of momentum. He takes far to long to find his options and when he does he almost writes himself off for the ball back because his technique is so incredibly poor for a player at that level, that he either ends up in his back or in a position that would be nearly impossible to adjust his body from to receive it back. Aside from that,stevie sits inbetween the two centre backs now, in a deeper position than them and almost all of sakhos passes are to him who then moves it on - then people start banging on about stats this and the other. 

I can't get  over how unnatural he is on the ball, every touch is thought out, every pass he needs to concentrate on his technique - it just looks abnormal and incredibly limited developmentally. I rarely rant about our players but the way some people go on about this guy is just ridiculous. 

Edit:  I won't even start on his positioning. In a defensive situation, if Jonno is pressing the  winger, the right sided centre half should be the cover and the left sided the balance - it's an absolute no no to get caught flat and ball watching and I literally couldn't count the amount of times I've seen him get caught.

Note the ""try"" in the poster. He has a perfectly valid point which is that if gay people for some reason don't want to be gay they should be free to try to not be gay, regardless of the likilihood of success.

His comparison stems from the fact that we give cosmetic surgery to people to make them look like the gender they associate with in spite of being totally unable to change their sexuality.

&gt; An initial scan took me [Cook (2013)](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article), a study that looked at the general consensus amongst the scientific community about whether climate change is man-made or not. The results were obtained by reviewing peer-reviewed papers published from 1991-2011 that use the keywords 'global warming' or 'global climate change' and classifying the leanings of their abstracts. The results found that 32.6% of abstract were in support of the idea that climate change is human caused, 66.4% stated no opinion on the subject, 0.7% rejected the human role in climate change, whilst 0.3% held an undecided opinion. Filtering out the papers that had no opinion on the subject (since inevitably the reasoning would be because the paper was not addressing that aspect of the climate change problem), that means that 97% of papers endorsed the idea that humans are responsible for climate change whilst 3% either reject/are sceptical of the notion.

true,grotscif,null,null,"I took part in two hitchhiking events in my time at uni.

In the first, each team simply had to hitch as far from campus (West Midlands) as possible in 36 hours, by any means necessary. This contest is run every year. The winning teams usually get as far as eastern Europe, northern Africa, or even sometimes Asia - winners typically ""hitch hike"" a plane ride. It's all for charity so sometimes you can get lucky at an airport. Teams are 2-5 people but obviously smaller teams had a greater chance of getting rides. For safety, each team had to have at least 1 male.

In this event, it was me (male) and 2 other guys. So for the most part we were ""hitching"" on trains. Which just means persuading the ticket barrier guard to let you through then hoping there's no ticket conductor on the train itself. The train we got to London *did* have a ticket inspector who was none too pleased and the Transport Police met the train at Euston. We were able to wrangle our way out of it since a) there were a good 6 or 7 other teams on this train too and I guess it would have been too much hassle to arrest us all and b) ""it's for charity!"". Not wanting to risk getting in trouble again, we made sure to find the inspector on each subsequent train and ask permission. We actually schmoozed our way through the London Underground surprisingly easily, and got another train to somewhere ~10 miles from Dover. We got our first and only car ride from there into Dover itself, getting there about 7 hours in to the challenge. It took us well over an hour to get that lift, first asking around at a service station and then thumbing at a motorway on-ramp. I guess people are too intimidated to pick up 3 quite tall guys. Of course, all 50+ teams were trying to use Dover as their exit point from the country. Unfortunately the ferry companies were having none of it. So each team needed to try to find a car willing to get them onto the ferry. My team was trying for a total of 17 hours and got nowhere. We eventually gave up and paid for train tickets home again. We were not the least successful team!

The second event, rather than being a distance challenge, we simply had to get to 5 set locations dotted around the UK, revealed only on the morning of setting off. This was a 24 hour challenge. This time it was just one girl and I, so we were much less scary-looking. Due to speed and convenience, we still mostly relied on trains as the targets were quite spread out. When we didn't have any choice but to get a car ride, we didn't have too much difficulty. Once we got talking to the drivers, they usually got quite interested and excited about the challenge we were doing, and often were willing to drive us much further than they originally intended to, especially since it was for charity. Managed to get a few extra donations this way too! We ultimately got 4 out of the 5 targets - and likely would have gotten the final one (Brighton) given an extra hour or two.

Certainly met some interesting people during both experiences and had a lot of fun - of course it can also be very frustrating standing with your thumb out for several hours in the cold rain and in the dark, getting nowhere. Didn't feel unsafe at any time while hitching. Only time I felt a bit uneasy was roughing it overnight in the Dover arrivals lounge with a bunch of homeless people - though nothing bad happened. I also learnt that if you ask nicely, most people in charge of transport don't mind you getting on for free. But if you don't ask, they do get very upset (rightfully so!). One last thing I should add - this competition's been run at my Uni for over 20 years (I think), 1000s of teams have participated and there have never been any incidents.

He is skilled at PR. He knows if he keeps spouting things about the EU and foreigners he'll get the Daily Mail/Express knee jerk reactionary vote (IE, a wide slice of the population). He also knows that if he speaks about any other policy he has (currently none officially because they don't have a full manifesto) he won't get elected. I once got the chance to ask him what his other policies were, and he basically said ""I'm not telling you"".

And is he a man of the People? Is he fuck! He's a publicly educated former investment banker who idolises Maggie Thatcher. He's playing the routine as David ""related to the Queen"" Cameron played between 2009 and 2010, remember that? Or am I the only one here who remembers that?

He's not Britains anti-establishment savior, he's a clever politician who has been shown to hold unsavoury views and is very good at spin and like all good politicians he knows how to use fear, anger, frustration and knee jerk reactions to damaging effect.

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"Nigel Farage and his party UKIP have a point about the EU - it is a flawed institution, and certainly undemocratic. The influential technocrats in the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, are not directly elected by citizens. The Eurozone relies on the decision-making of an unaccountable European Central Bank. Furthermore the EU’s proposed trans-atlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) has dangerous implications for citizens. However they recently disowned their 2010 general election manifesto, called it 'drivel' and replaced it with, well, nothing. At the local level they make vague populist statements like ""council tax should be as low as possible"" and preach about green space protection while planning to abolish the 'costly' EU Landfill Directive. They are not an acceptable protest vote and this has only scratched the surface of why.

Let’s put aside for a moment UKIP’s headline-grabbing racism, sexism and homophobia. This is disproportionately covered over the less overt but more destructive institutional and historical forms of discrimination. Disguised injustices embedded within society should take priority over backwards bullies in blazers outing themselves in public forums. Exposing these people is still important, of course, but it won't deal with foundations of racism. The police's issues with racially-motivated systemic corruption deserve greater scrutiny than the usual suspects mouthing off in their little England lairs.

Farage and his ‘movement’ portray themselves as plucky patriots fighting against the global elites of politicians, technocrats and the mainstream media. He makes sure the public see him drinking and smoking, but a common man he is not. Privately educated former investment bankers turned politicians don’t tend to queue in supermarkets - unless there’s a camera around. As the European elections approached, his anti-EU views have afforded him even more media coverage. This arouses concern, considering the relatively marginalised Greens actually have representation in Parliament. UKIP might well have their day come the European elections, but trading as a single-issue party is a short-term strategy. There is optimism UKIP will peak now but remain at the margins because the socially liberal, racially tolerant public can’t stomach their prehistoric views. The Tory mainstream media have ensured that their non-economic obsessions are kept high profile. If the same establishment argued the benefits of the EU and attacked their economic policies, then UKIP support could nosedive.

Voters will soon decide on a member of European Parliament to legislate on a number of issues, not only immigration and sovereignty. The EU can regulate banks and set a bonus cap. It can maintain online privacy and uphold human rights, but it could also mean permanently privatised railways, austerity and there's the spectre of the profit-over-people TTIP trade deal. And so the EU economic war on the vulnerable of whatever race, gender or sexuality continues, as the gap widens between rich and poor. UKIP believes in similar economic principles to the EU. And yet Farage has convinced many to support him by posing as an outsider to the system. Around the edges of the UKIP phenomena are some revealing hypocrisies and insights into the debate on global democracy.

Farage the former financier proclaims the Iron Lady as his heroine, and accordingly his UKIP business suits are evangelical Thatcherites. This is also known as the neoliberal orthodoxy, a consensus of ideas promoting small government, low taxes, privatisation, bank deregulation and trade liberalisation. From multinational brands to global finance, this orthodoxy is intertwined with our lives. This makes UKIP’s accusations that the EU threatens sovereignty strange, when their adopted neoliberalism has been undermining the autonomy of nation states for decades through globalisation. Open borders have domestic benefits, but a transient minority with resources can easily exploit this system. It is simply not an equal playing field when local small businesses have to compete with tax evading multinationals. However, since this UKIP-supported economic doctrine was implemented, its illusion of meritocracy has been exposed, as international inequality has risen and social mobility has fallen. 

UKIP’s anti-EU argument would at least be consistent if it was carried over to the other neoliberal global institutions, which wield more combined power than Farage’s continental nemesis. The undemocratic governance of the EU is replicated internationally. Can anyone remember having a say in the G20? The G7? Or seeing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) choose its board? Meanwhile the World Trade Organisation (WTO) oversees secretive trade talks of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal involving the collective economic might of East Asia, Australia and the US. This pact is very similar to aforementioned TTIP in that it favours big business over citizens. UKIP appear to want Commonwealth trade to replace EU trade, yet with UKIP having not challenged the anti-consumer TTIP terms, why should the public feel confident with them as an alternative?

UKIP’s silence on the TTIP talks is of interest, because it should be a potential weapon against the EU. This is a trade pact between their sworn enemy and the US, no slouches themselves when it comes to economic imperialism. The talks' aim is the harmonisation of rules and regulations governing trade between regions to reduce tariffs and streamline transactions. This could create more jobs, but there are caveats - namely that corporations would be able to sue governments if they impede their enterprise in private courts. This clause was formulated by the European Commission bureaucrats, yet UKIP haven’t even mentioned it. There are a host of open goals regarding TTIP that the party are missing, from having to take on other countries’ laws to the lack of transparency and accountability in its formulation. The roster of beneficiaries lobbying for TTIP includes multinationals Monsanto, American Tobacco, IBM, BP, Deutsche Bank and Nasdaq. So UKIP attack European bureaucrats when they undermine Britons, but are not as concerned about non-domiciled, predatory big business. This does not fit the bullish British underdog image Farage keeps peddling.

Concurrently the globalised mainstream media, with close relationships to neoliberal elites, fail to challenge UKIP’s free market economics because they subscribe to it. These outlets continue to focus on UKIP’s gaffes, scandals or their visceral anti-immigration argument. An informed debate should include their belief in undemocratic ‘soft’ market power seen in the EU and beyond. The media plays its neoliberal hand with barely any discussion of TTIP or the EU’s privatising agenda. The latter is something even UKIP voters don’t always support, putting them in agreement with the EU-sceptic left. These nuances are lost in the cacophony of outrage.

The beneficiaries of standard media attacks on UKIP are the relatively ‘right-on’ Tories who subscribe to the same broken economics. If the media were doing their job, a credible attack on UKIP’s economics would allow us to have a debate on the neoliberal orthodoxy of the major parties. As it stands, UKIP and the mainstream media perpetuate similar versions of the status quo that gave us the Great Recession, by concentrating on a small picture of bigots being bigots. Many UKIP supporters are not swayed by these coordinated establishment attacks because they distrust the establishment and, like many, they vote based on economics calculations.

Ultimately we have the choice between the socially liberal, austerity-imposing European juggernaut that prevents challenges to boom and bust capitalism, or those who mock threaten this broken system with more of the same, adding a sinister social conservatism along the way. A third way - of a democratic EU promoting bottom-up sustainable economics with a fairer competition laws - goes begging. The UKIP debate is a complicated mix of national, regional and global debates. But you can't study their underlying neoliberal orthodoxy on any national curriculum, or understand it by watching the news.

Yeah, there's some DW related type stuff to see, but, if memory serves, it's not until the end of Season 1 of Torchwood &amp; the last 3 episodes of Season 3 of Doctor Who where they merge together, DW episodes, Utopia, the sound of drums &amp; Last of the Time Lords. 

In Torchwood season 1, the main character, Jack Harkness, introduced in DW season 1 with Rose &amp; the 9th Doctor actually departs Torchwood (near the end of season 1) with no real mention as to the ""WHY"" in the Torchwood realm. Captain Jack had run off to find the Doctor, which kicks off the episode Utopia going into, The Sound of drums &amp; then,  Last of the Time lords. 

So, you COULD jump between Torchwood &amp; DW season 3, in the first episodes of Torchwood, episode 2, I think, you see a DW ""Easter egg"" that kicks off the ""build up"" towards Captain Jack running off at the end of Torchwood season 1 &amp; popping up in DW season 3, Utopia, through the end of DW season 3. 

It was be a pain in the ass to watch the episodes to maintain ""continuity"" in such a fashion, so I wouldn't bother. You won't miss a thing just watching DW &amp; THEN Torchwood season 1.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"A very talented squad that was riddled with injuries. There's a great infographic about Pochettino on the front page right now, comparing him to Martinez and Rodgers.

And you're right; FdB has been more successful. But he's been successful like AVB was; at one of the biggest clubs in a (very) small league. Ajax's success also coincided with the downfall of PSV and Feyenoord; both have had swoons. I'm sure that part of that was De Boer's doing through his success at Ajax, but there's no denying that Ajax is the biggest dog in the fight in Holland.

He won't have all the advantages he had at Ajax here. We don't have a youth system that can constantly churn out first team players, and it's completely silly to think that bringing in a senior team staff can change that, or that Spurs will overhaul their *entire* youth system just to suit a new manager. Moreover, de Boer's system works in part because the defending in Holland is *awful*. For all his success in the domestic league, he's won *nothing* in Europe; Ajax have never even advanced past the Group Stages of the CL under him; in 32 European games, he's won 10, drawn 6, and lost 16, with a -19 goal difference.

Finally; Pochettino may not have had ""success"" in terms of winning trophies, but he's now had decent seasons with small clubs in two different leagues in Europe. Yes, he was fired while Espanyol was bottom of the table; we hired Harry away from a bottom-of-the-league Portsmouth, he'd never won a damn thing previous, and he did alright for us.

Success at one club is not necessarily indicative of success at another; likewise, failure at one club is not necessarily indicative of failure at another, and to view managers in such stark terms is silly.

FdB is just as big a risk as Pochettino, because he hasn't ever managed outside of Ajax, much less in England. Acting as if Pochettino is a terrible choice next to de Boer is silly; both are good managers, and both carry different but relatively equal risks.",0,1401149802,null,0,false,0,chrtoeh,t3_26jdtd,t1_chrtoeh,t1_chrt0p8,null,1433966910,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am biased, as I think everyone is, but I can probably provide you with the negatives of leaving Europe and then someone else can provide the positives.

Negatives:

1) This is more of an opinion, I suppose, but it could be argued that as a global community we should be coming closer together - not farther apart. There are worldwide issues such as global warming that we could tackle far better together, rather than individually.

2) One of the founding principles of the EU, or so I remember, was to compete with the world superpowers. At the time, this was Russia and America and now it has stemmed more to feature China. The fact is that, with third-world countries surging economically (e.g. India and Brazil), we should arguably unite to maintain our economic strength.

3) Despite arguments otherwise, being part of the EU or even a superstate does not ruin our individuality. The United States of America is incredibly diverse, yet still one country - no? As Europeans, our histories are intertwined deeply and as such we probably should be together.

4) I'm not an expert in economics, but as far as I am aware being a member of the EU removes tax barriers and as such leaving would increase taxes on imported goods. Historically, this was the reason for smuggling items such as tea.

5) Although everyone complains about how Eastern Europeans come over to our country and use our public services, we too have this right. Thousands of Brits emigrate to France and other European countries. Being an EU member state makes this far easier.

Positives:

1) Immigration poses a problem, not because of there being foreigners as they in themselves typically put more back into the system than they ever take out, but rather because of population growth. We have a very large population for our rather tiny size, such that housing is arguably running low. We just need to lower our population and leaving the EU would cut immigration, helping this slightly.

2) Independence is another factor. If you're a patriot, you want independence for the simple reason of having it. Why should another country dictate us?

true,UndercoverFiretruck,1986,,"Yes, yes and yes. If we're counting on Lukaku to lead the line next season then I'm sorry to say but then another trophy less season is on its way. He's just not good enough... Yet. But that's alright. He has all the time in the world to work on his weaknesses and turn into the Lukraken we all expect him to be since he is only 20 years old. As for Bamford, we're talking about a young striker who performed well in the lower leagues. Not trying to discredit his efforts but you simply can't compare it with the Premiership. I expect great things from him and I hope he makes the first team in a few years but he's way too raw and inexperienced so as to count on him week in, week out. 

We all saw how many points were lost because our strikers couldn't put away chances. We need to get that killer instinct back that was lost when Drogs left. Someone that at the blink of an eye can turn a simple pass into a goal and completely change the dynamic of the game when opposition defenses are rigid or when we need a last minute win and have only one counter attack opportunity to score. If we manage to get a striker who can give us that edge, then we will be a force to be reckoned with next season. If we don't splash the cash to strenthen our unarguably weakest area, then we'll simply see a repeat of this season which I don't think would bode well with supporters or Roman. I think Mourinho deserves to at least get to pick his leading man to build the team around rather than trying to get the team to work with players he inherited. 

Best way I can put it: Imagine it's the 2015 CL final against Bayern. Minute 92 and the score is 2-2. Matić blocks a Kroos long range effort and the ball goes out for a corner. Robben takes the corner and Cahill heads it away towards Schürrle who skillfully blazes past Lahm and sprints onwards towards the last man Alaba. A blue figure sprints parallel Schürrle and awaits the pass from him. The German does brilliantly to scoop his pass over Alaba and avoid the offside call and get it to his target man. Question is: who do you want to be at the receiving end of that ball? I don't know about you but I would feel 100x more confident with Costa or Mandzusik (spelling?) facing Neuer than Bamford or Lukaku or any of our current strikers.

Normally you'd just convert money and take it with you, but make sure you have a card with you you can use abroad just in case. A lot of companies charge a fee for transferring the currencies for you so it works out cheaper to get the money beforehand.

&gt;Also, how do you usually buy the tickets for your plane? 

Nowadays you use a price comparison website, back in ye olden dayes before they were popular I don't really know. Instead of getting a plane from a specific airport to a specific airport my family would always go from the cheapest airport, even if it wasn't the nearest to us. If Bristol are selling tickets to switzerland for £800 return and gatwick have them for £300 it's more cost effective to just drive for 3 hours longer and take the plane from london.

No need to spend huge but think he need more potent wide men that are good utilities (lallana anywhere across the attacking 3, jay Rodriguez left side or up top) Both proven they can perform in the premier league, English and extremely talented. Also in dire need of a handy left back, Ricardo Rodriguez looks decent going forward and fairly solid, wont set the world alight but will do a job, looks so much more reliable than Rose/Fryers/Naughton. Bond is a young English keeper who played for watford on and off this season, seen him play for England U21's and Watford and looks handy. Will be a great cup keeper to have and its time we replace Friedel and get him in the coaching staff.

true,the_leander,null,null,"&gt; There isn't enough time to educate students about the historic, political, social, religious, economical contexts surrounding ANY novel, Steinbeck included.

Except things like the great depression were already covered briefly in history class by the time we hit Steinbeck. In terms of American slang and dialect I again point to US media, by the time I was 15 I had 10 years of contact with it. So with the possible exception of alfalfa, it was as easy to read and understand as any modern novella.

&gt; Shakespeare is not a misery too millions. Trust me, I did him alongside Chaucer, now that was a misery. 

Ok now that's just cruel. No teen should have to deal with that!

&gt;No more stark that Steinbeck's strange dialect. It took me a good while to adjust to reading the language of Grapes of Wrath, as long if not longer than Shakespeare. 

Having grown up in a household with a family that loved film noir, to 15 year old me Steinbeck's use of words didn't even slow me down. 

&gt; There are plenty great texts for Children to engage with, learn, and take to heart. Nothing has been lost, just changed! 

I want to believe that what'll replace it will be as provocative and accessible, but I look at his past record coupled with the various committees to ensure only the most inoffensive tepid nonsense gets a look in and well.. It doesn't look good. 

&gt; I read many of those texts at the age of 15/16 (GCSE AGE) in part of the syllabus of IGCSE,

Clearly you went to a far better school than I did. Pre gcse we had Romeo and Juliet as our first exposure to Shakespeare, during gcse we had Romeo and Juliet again along with Of Mice And Men. Half the year group had another Shakespeare play and some other novella. That was it though. **None** of those other authors even had a mention. Not pre gcse and not during. 

Recreationaly I went more for Anne McCaffrey, Raymond E Fiest, John Grisham Frederick Forsyth and Mario Puzo.. Gotta thank my Dad for challenging me to get into reading as school had all but killed it off. 

&gt; Steinbeck's language and the period setting, like you would with any novel, unless you leap in their with a great understanding of early 20th century American written slang and the period.

Thanks to television, most of it didn't even register as being a different dialect to 15 year old me. It was just the same way of speaking as those old black and white films grandad enjoyed... 

&gt; You seem to have this idea that Shakespeare is penetrable to young adults, and maybe you found it a little complex when you studied it at GCSE level, but honestly, it's not inaccessible to the masses and I know many people who delighted in it. 

I could read and understand the text, it just bored me to tears. In my own school Shakespeare was universally loathed.

It was not immigrants that crashed the economy it was bankers that have been given the right to create money as debt out of thin air - and then rent it to the public. This is one fundamental that needs to change in the economy. 

It was not immigrants that failed to build council housing which has lead to a housing crisis it was Thatcher Majour Blair and Cameron because they know if houses are expensive it gives artificial boost to the economy. This needs to change.

It was not immigrants that sold off our national infrastructure to corporations so we have to pay whatever the corporate cartels charge.

It is not immigrants who have lead the NHS into crisis through a real terms cut in funding, its Cameron. In fact the NHS is kept going by immigrants. 

Its not immigrants who have created petro-economies so that we must fight wars to secure oil, and cause climate change.

UKIP are just a variation on a theme, when things are not going so well blame the ""other"". Blame Jews, or Blacks, or Muslims or Immigrants, never blame the white upper-class establishment that created the rules and maintain them - they look to much like ""us"" it must be those dirty immigrants who have ruined everything.

I subscribed here 27 days ago and have been reading up so as to best jump into things when the season starts anew. I'm also planning on making the jaunt down to Chicago for the [Fire v.

I'm also doing a roundup post in /r/PremierLeague and then in /r/Soccer after I finish up the MLS subreddit circuit.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

It was one of my favorite games of the campaign because it was the first time in a stretch of about two months that the Swans got what they deserved. Getting bounced from the FA Cup by Everton, dropping out of the Europa League. Really well played games at Goodison Park and Anfield in the league, that produced 0 points. The combination of the late Glen Murray PK at home against CP and the disappointing home loss to the Baggies after going up in the first half made me think that we really could be in serious trouble. Swansea dominated the first half at home and produced two goals through Jonathan de Guzman, the second was that silky smooth backheel by Bony, and for the first time in a long time, were able to close it out and take three well deserved points. I was also a real big fan of Jonjo Shelvey's late winner in the 2-1 win at Craven Cottage way back in November.",0,1401158634,null,0,false,0,chrxe54,t3_26jez6,t1_chrxe54,t3_26jez6,null,1433968659,2,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,2

I've seen [this documentary before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wko1QNRJohg), on the British security service targeting Somali youth. The only thing that keeps entering my mind is that the BSS is barking up the wrong tree. Not that there aren't crooked Somalis, but having extensive experience with Somali communities in Canada, aside from being generally apathetic, we're not insidious. Not that they should be targeting to begin with, but it's just bad targeting altogether.

A certain part of it seems to be the want to scare off Somalis for one reason or another. Al-Shabab are literally children trained by warlords. They don't send people to the west to do recon or whatever. There's not a single reason to target the Somali community except to try and make them feel unwelcome and scare them off.",0,1401162941,null,0,1401163471,0,chrz4br,t3_26igsc,t1_chrz4br,t1_chrf3i1,null,1433969541,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If the code for the voting machines is open source, and if reasonable precautions are taken to ensure the compiler, operating system, and hardware are clean (see [Reflections on Trusting Trust](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html)), I'd be mostly OK with it.

I'd still want some means of having a *meaningful* recount, which means the voter should be able to see and confirm a record of the vote. That's possibly why punched cards are used for some voting machines - remember all the ""swinging chads"" etc in that US election years ago. There's no point recounting if the voting machines silently changed some votes as they were recorded.

We trust paper to record information accurately for centuries sometimes, and we've trusted paper voting systems for a long time. New doesn't automatically mean better.

true,Mythodiir,canada,Canada,"God, it's insane how ignorant everyone but people who have actually been to Somalia are of Somalia. Of course it's an undeveloped, destitute nation, but it's not hell on earth, unless it's a refugee camp, a dying village, a warlord's village, a pirate ridden coast, war-ridden Mogadishu or the middle of the fucking desert, which is what most of the country is not (or countries since Somaliland is sovereign). It's a place with people, many of whom are living life in a rather straight forward manner. Most Somali youth who visit Somalia, like I have, and trust me, I met other Somali teenagers from the west there, are usually there to visit family or go to entirely non-extremist madrasahs while they're off from proper school. I'm an atheist myself, and I'm not a fan of conservative Islam, but the madrasahs in Somalia aren't hives of extremism, it's just the classical education of Somalia that has existed since the dark ages. I think it's a shitty education, and it's mostly about religion and languages, but they're not there for any ulterior motive. I've always felt the best description of Somalis visa vi other world cultures would be apathetic and ascetic. The vast, vast, vast majority of Somalis are in the west because of the civil war. Somalia had always had internal conflict, like all nations, but mixed with the deep sense of humiliation in the Islamic world as a whole, and current military technology, it's become more destructive than anything in the past. I don't know, I just get terribly annoyed because it really isn't the country many people think it is.

Not to underplay the horrible things that go on in the country, but only the truly ignorant would think that was somehow the majority of a country. I've been to Hargeysa and Berbera, both in Somaliland. I've seen pictures of Bosaso, Kismayo (which are in Somalia), and many Somali cities don't look that stark. Mogadishu is the posterboy of war-torn Somalia, which is a bit crushing because pictures of pre-war Mogadishu look so much better. It's difficult to describe Somalia because there isn't a lot to say. All of the negative, and mostly justified and correct things have been said, but very little of the decent or good, which aren't unique to Somalia, just very human, go unreported because they're not worth saying. The issue is that some people upon only hearing the negative compose the generic image of the pit of human suffering, which exists only in incredibly minuscule pockets anywhere on earth. It is a very human place. [This blog is pretty spot on](http://backpackingman.com/one-week-hargeisa-somalilands-friendly-capital/) (although it does seem a bit forced). I don't think the poster is overly generous in his description. I think the wonderful thing about Somalia that does set it apart is that it's not overly populated. there are about 17 million Somalis, 9 million of which live in Somalia (5 million in Ethiopia, 1 million in Kenya, 1 million in Djibouti/Yemen, and the rest in the Arab and Western worlds). It's not a densely populated region. Most Somali cities, towns and villages are remarkably quite and relaxed places.

Edit: I would like to add, there is terrorist activity in Somalia, certainly, and possibly in Somaliland, although I've never heard of it in Somaliland in particular. I'm not defending Somalia, there's just a horribly ignorant image of country I don't like. I just want to emphasise, as someone whose been there, it really isn't that bad. Also, the most remarkable fact about Somalia I haven't stated above is that the place is teeming in livestock. I've never experienced it anywhere else on the planet. You'd have to watch some footage of the place to see it. The owners of the cattle are incredibly liberal with them. Many goat herders just let their goats wander outside their home freely with no fear of theft. Then again, I've only been to Somaliland, but I've seen footage of many other regions of Somalia and it looks rather similar.",0,1401164561,null,0,1401168786,0,chrzpa7,t3_26igsc,t1_chrzpa7,t1_chrievj,null,1433969816,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,iKSv2,null,null,"* Victor Moses (Liverpool) - This guy qualifies as homegrown and is strong physically, so I can see this guy staying (only as a bench player though at max).

* Marko Marin (Sevilla) - Marin himself has said that ""There are talks that Chelsea want him back to stay"" however after watching his performances, I very much doubt it unless Jose has something totally different planned for him.

* Ryan Bertrand (Aston Villa) - Cant see him starting,I personally want him to be used as a part of Shaw deal to Soton (if Ryan wants to leave &amp; we want Shaw). If he stays,wouldnt be anything more than a rotational player ( cup matches,etc).

* Oriol Romeu (Valencia) - Almost no progress on him, but I read a loan report about him where it is mentioned that as a pivot player, he better at long range passes ( which he learnt at his time in Barca / La Masia) but defensively he shuts down sometimes, If Jose can polish his defensive soundness, I can very well see him playing along side Matic, however chances are rare, but I personally would love him in, considering he can offer so much if trained as we wanted.

* Wallace (Inter) - No chance, loan or maybe will be sold.

* Josh McEachran (Wigan Athletic) - No chance yet, needs to work alot, maybe another loan.

* Nathaniel Chalobah (Middlesbrough) - Might be squad player... I personally want him to play in our Cup games and emulate Matic ;)

* Patrick Van Aabholt (Vitesse) - Sold or loaned again to Vitesse.

* Christian Atsu (Vitesse) - Loan again, may play in Chelsea if his work permit issues are resolved, not sure about the progress.

* Bertrand Traore (Vitesse) - He himself prefers the loan, lets see...has the potential to be here but our midfield is already stacked with awesome potential.

* Kurt Zouma (St. Etienne) - Our choice as a heir to Terry, Jose's signing, definately here to learn...or if he insists on play time, he might be somewhere in PL teams.

There's also the possibility that he thought Chelsea without Hazard in the first leg of the PSG tie in particular were a lot weaker and so is looking for a back-up who can keep the team ticking over in case of injury.

Of course I think that this being untrue is the most likely explanation but I could see possibilities for why he might inquire about Lavezzi. The team is looking mostly great except the positions you mentioned but it does arguably lack some depth and experience, a couple of older players might not be the worst thing to tide the team over when the younger players aren't in form because I feel like that was sometimes an issue this season.

The people who think UKIP is the magic solution to everything in this country and Mister Farage is some sort of right wing Jesus who'll fix all the things by leaving the EU and rounding up that kurdish bloke who runs that paper shop you don't like are delusional on a level between the natural law party (who believe meditation is the solution to all our woes) and the Jacobite party (a Scottish party who, I kid you not, wants an independent Scotland with border at Derby) *and* have memories like a goldfish.

First off, if you think leaving the EU is magically going to solve everything, you obviously do not understand politics or economics. Mister Farage doesn't want to leave the EU out of conviction and inflexible, almost cult like patriotism to the UK. IF he was so principled he wouldn't be in the middle of his very own expenses scandal where he's been taking *millions* in taxpayer expenses. He wants the EU out of his hair so he can put his own Farage brand of policies in place. He is an Atlantic Thatcherite with a worrying amount of authoritarian conservatism to boot.

Let me ask you this: does he ever talk about his other policies? No, especially not now! He knows banging on about the EU and immigration exclusively gets him votes and that's exactly what he's doing, because if he says any of his other policies, (currently none officially other than the two aforementioned), he risks losing votes. He knows what the people what. He knows fear, anger and knee jerk reactions win votes because we're a scared, angry and knee jerk nation. When a murder happens involving, say, social media, we get scared of other ""Social Murderers"", angry that the government (who people keep complaining about being in our lives) has not done anything to stop this and then we demand social media becomes illegal. Mister Farage knows this and he's using that to devastating effect for his own aims, not ours.

He is a politician, not a man of the people. He works for himself, not us. He knows the dark arts of politics and how to get elected and he and a team of his own advisors are working to get power by manipulating us. It's politics. This is what politicians do. He wants you to think he's got the cure for all that ails you because he wants elected, not because he gives a shit about you. Like Mister Cameron before him, once in power he'll shit on you and if he or his advisors are clever enough he'll make you enjoy it, but that's harder to do and a story for another time (ala Berlusconi).

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"Alright mate, well there are a lot of coaches who feel the same way and share this bullshit opinion 

A big focus in coaching right now as far as defenders defending is concerned is that a lot of the focal point is around how the fullback opposite the pressuring fullback no longer has to sit flat or tuck in because modern fullbacks should be able to recover from that position if a diagonal ball is played behind them. One of the biggest examples I saw was how flanno would struggle to do it because of how poor some of the liverpool centre halfs. - sakho and skrtel being the two main culprits. 

And as far as the passing to stevie goes, we will have to agree to disagree - a great deal of his passes are now square to gerrard and not forward, it's not his fault, it's his job but that doesn't change it. The single major point of stevie sitting between the centre halves was to create most of his moves from deep and use the central defenders as a collection point - I'm not saying sakho should be playing more forward passes, I'm saying completed passes square are enhancing these stats, and other factors need to be considered when people are going "" look at how high this percentage is"" - you may not think so, but by far his most frequent pass is to gerrard, otherwise stevie is just playing as an extra covering midfielder - which he is not. If sakho isn't using him more than any other player, he's wasted.But I'd say you'd give a great session on it since you're able to curse. 

I'm looking for a debate, not an argument but in fairness nobody is really providing a pro sakho analysis other then the he's physical, commanding etc usual cliches. 

You're saying he's bypassing the deep lying  midfield players for the more advanced ones but our only deep lying midfield player is gerrard in a single pivot at the bottom of the triangle - he sits a yard behind and between the centre backs who split now when we have the ball,so he's hardly bypassing him when he's square or often more advanced than him.

When Gerrard was moved to that position in his absence he naturally found it hard to get back into the team. Of course when he was asked to play in a slightly more forward position near the end of the season he was poor, and that may be most fresh in your memory, but you can't hold him to the standard of players who are accustomed to that role. He was playing out of position fresh off a serious injury.
&gt; 

With all due respect - he wasn't fresh off a serious injury. He had been back from injury since the end of January, and that wasn't even serious. His ACL was a long time ago. He just couldn't get into the team because he simply isn't good enough, and even when asked to do that 10 minute cameo versus NUFC, he just continued to hack people down on 25 yards and even got a yellow within 3 minutes basically. Match fitness was barely an aspect imo, he's just not that good at anything anymore. I accept that this is a divided opinion amongst most Liverpool fans however.

You seem to forget that modern party politics is less about the individual now. The campaigns and Opposition that Ed has run he has done so at the behest of his party. The only people to ever complain about what or how much he's doing have been the occasional Minister, never part of the Shadow Cabinet and certainly never anyone close to Ed himself.

If Ed fails at the next election it will be because Labour's divide still has not healed. Another thing they can thank Blair for. There are people in Labour who want Ed to fail because he was not on their side of the Blair-Brown split.

Yet when we hear about defections to the likes of UKIP, who has suffered worst? The Conservatives. The Conservatives didn't have to deal with the lack of unity that Labour has to deal with daily, and yet they're still managing to trail in the polls.

I think Ed is a better leader than people give him credit for purely because his party is split into two and he has to keep them both happy, and over the past, what? Four years now he's done that with some admirable skill.

All subjective based on your experiences though, isn't it?
Everytime I've been to Liverpool I've thought that while most of the city centre is nice enough, the rest of it is a bit shit. The nightlife is good but I've not once managed to go out there without getting some hassle from someone. 

Doesn't mean either one of us are correct.
One I personally have:

You'll often hear people in the north say they are much more friendly than those in the south.
I live in Manchester and I was born in Manchester, all my family is from Manchester, but Manchester is by far the most rude place I've ever been to.

true,iMisconception_fixer,null,null,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_migration_to_Spain

I believe this is where he got his figures from.

It clearly states on Wikipedia that only 21.5% of British citizens living in Spain are aged 65 or over.

I doubt all of the other ~550K people retired early.

&gt; a somalian asylum seeker

That's quite irrelevant as asylum seekers don't get free movement within EU. So, for secondary migration to work, they have to be citizen of the country. Essentially they gained citizenship of an EU country.

&gt; it is absolutely right that the uk should offer asylum to those that need it, but to pretend that the economic and social impact to the host nation is the same in the example you give, is disingenuous on your part.

As we're discussing about migration, the asylum seeker part is irrelevant again.

There's social issues with British citizens living in Spain:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_migration_to_Spain#Social_issues

In fact I would say that economic impact in Spain due to British citizens is larger than EU citizens coming to UK mainly because of 3 reasons:

1. Sizeable proportion of EU migrants come to UK to study. They pay international fees. Universities profit from it and the government gets to pay less for funding.

2. Higher proportion of EU migrants coming to the UK are of young age, therefore they're likely to study, work and pay taxes, so contributing to UK government budget. They're also contributing to research progress among UK universities.

3. In Spain there are higher number of retired British citizens, they cannot work, so they do not pay much in taxes, thus contributing basically zero to Spanish government budget. [This article explains the issue](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jul/09/travelnews.spain).

Here's quotes from the article:

&gt;The society is now calling for extra resources to deal with the rising costs. Regional health authorities complain that providing drugs, health and social care for more than a million ageing Brits - and to a lesser extent, German and Dutch - is crippling, prompting the Spanish Health Minister, Elena Salgado, to demand an annual £40m from the UK government.

|

&gt;'We cover places like Calpe where the official population has almost doubled to 26,000 and the British out-number the Spanish. But the real population is closer to 50,000, and as most funding for public services is population-based, there's not enough doctors, fire engines, police, etc.'

true,jvdbization,lfc68,,"&gt;He had been back from injury since the end of January.

What are you on about? He was injured in the 2-2 draw with Villa which was on Jan 18th, MCL strain.   By early March he was still trying to get match-fit playing with the reserves, and wasn't in full contention for a spot with the first team until mid-March, United away.  By that time Gerrard had already well-established himself in the holding position where Lucas makes his bread.

&gt;He just couldn't get into the team because he simply isn't good enough

More broad strokes.  As I said, Gerrard had replaced him in his natural position.  Was Lucas good enough to play in a more attacking role? No.  And he never really has been.  His success at Liverpool began with his transition to the holding/anchor role, winning 10/11 LFC player of the year having scored just 1 goal, for example. 

&gt;Match fitness was barely an aspect imo

But it was.  It just was.  Lucas, at 27, was clearly slower and more lethargic after returning.  Playing in a more forward role, especially with Henderson's suspension, just exacerbated the fact.

&gt;he just continued to hack people down on 25 yards and even got a yellow within 3 minutes basically.

Since his return from injury in mid-march he played 319 minutes earning one yellow card.   Gerrard, playing in his position, also had card trouble.   It comes naturally when facilitating that role.  In the past few years Lucas has been one of the league leaders in both minutes per ground duels won and minutes per tackles won all-the-while maintaining a high pass-completion rate.  If a bad run of form, out of position, following a series of injuries has made you forget that, then you're simply short-sighted.

&gt;he's just not that good at anything anymore

By now you'll know my sentiments regarding this silly statement.  Lucas's future at Liverpool will depend on his willingness to be a back-up to Gerrard in the holding position.  A role he is still fully capable and qualified to fulfill.  Full stop. ",0,1401184255,null,0,false,0,chs476z,t3_26ijvs,t1_chs476z,t1_chs2zcv,null,1433971935,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"&gt;You implied that voters had replaced those who could reform the EU

What I said was, that it pushed out centrist reformers. These are MEPs that work in our interests in attempting to constrain or move the EU to something which works for us. Which is, pretty much every MEP in the Conservative party. I can pull out specific issues if you would prefer (although I personally have a negative opinion of Conservative MEPs)?

&gt;Opt out are not returned powers, they are powers never transferred.

Will have to disagree there. An opt-out is negotiated. Both at national (CoE) and MEP level. Taking the Arrest Warrant as an example, we partook in it for several years before utilising our opt-out.

&gt;I also don't just point at France, but add Denmark, Germany, Holland, Greece, Italy, Poland, Austria and Hungary to the list

Italy, France and the UK have electorates which are majorly disillusioned with their national Governments.

Increase in Anti-EU votes in the other places you mentioned;

- Denmark +2
- Holland (Guessing you meant NL?) +0
- Greece +2
- Poland +4
- Austria +2
- Hungary +0

...Not exactly screaming leave the EU, are they?

Across the EUP, [hardline] Eurosceptic seats increased from 56 out of 736 to 108 out of 751. Italy, France and the UK account for 70 of those seats in total and 44 (of 52) of the new ones.

Therefore the name ""emergency fund"" is a bit of a mis-nomer, because these situations are only an emergency for those without one - once you have a fund, these expenses are no longer emergencies!

The first stage of an emergency fund should be enough to cover your essential, non-negotiable expenses for an entire month in any instant-access account (can be a plain bank account, or e-Savings). This includes rent, bills (don't forget e.g. internet subscriptions), basic food, transport costs to job, but excludes things you could simply not do for a month like drinking, takeaways, waitrose finest etc. So your first task is to work out how much that is exactly (you've already worked out how much you can save, so you're presumably part way there) and make progress towards having that figure as a constant value in your instant-access account. The simplest account to do this in is the one you're currently using, just look at the balance column on your monthly statement and when this number never dips below the figure you set, congratulations you have an emergency fund, just be sure to keep it that way!

This being the first ever case of secession of part of an EU state in the history of the EU, there is no precedent set. So Spain would seek to set precedent that independence does not *automatically* guarantee membership of the EU. Apparently, they have the ability to block automatic entry through veto even if the reasons are entirely selfish.

The rest of the EU may be fine with Scotland being in the EU, but then the issue is whether Scotland gets to keep all its ""special deals"" that were negotiated and ratified under the banner of the UK (that one about discrimination against Welsh, English and NI students when it comes to fees is going to be a tough one, because as an independent state, they would then be fully discriminating against people from another EU state). Many of these special deals that were impossible for other new joiners of the EU to get.

Of course, that's not saying that Scotland won't be able to make it happen. By and large, the EU would probably like a member like the hypothetical independent Scotland to add to its combined strength. With a bit of negotiating, I'm sure Scotland, Spain and the EU can come to a mutually beneficial compromise.

We have to declare a holy war"".[10] Marzel also was involved in the controversial March 2009 flag parade through Umm al-Fahm. He led protests against the eighth Jerusalem Gay Pride parade of 2010, opining that ""[homosexuality] is a disease of choice, and a man can change his taste and his ways.

true,Ohmz27,,I don't have a bike,"Without footage, it sounds like this is what’s happened:

You were riding along a main road, and went into oncoming traffic lane to filter past vehicles in the left lane (not illegal if white-line is dashed). Car driver emerged from a side-road, making a left turn into your path, from behind a bus (so vision was obscured).

If that’s the case, you would have had priority, and there would have been give-way lines on the side-road she emerged from. It is illegal to change the direction of your vehicle without making proper observations, which it sounds like is exactly what the car driver did. She should have slowed right down before the junction, and edged out slowly. Whilst it’s not a common sight to see people drive/ride past junctions in the wrong lane, it should be expected that people would cut through oncoming lane to make a quick turn when in congestion. If you were filtering past traffic, your (left) lane must have been backed up, the driver should have seen this, and checked to see if somone wanted to make a quick right turn into her side-road, especially if the oncoming lane (the one you were in) was empty. She should have 100% slowed down and edged out if she was turning left and a BUS was stationary on the left just after junction…. People could have been crossing the road, specially if traffic in left lane was slow/stationary and oncoming lane was empty.

Bad driving on her part, you should try your best to explain that she was 100% responsible for the collision, and definitely argue if talk of a 50/50 liability is thrown around. This is all without footage, but it sounds like she turned into a road without making proper observations, even though there were signs that should have prompted her to slow down and edge out (presence of a stopped bus alone is enough to warrant extra observations). It’s good she’s apologised, it might feel a bit harsh to throw all blame her way, but it’s were the blame needs to be. Give-ways are there for a reason. She pulled out into your path without safe observations or road priority, forcing you brake hard.

Also, if the car driver wants to argue that another road-user told her it was okay to do the turn, that’s her problem. If she wants to argue that and get anywhere, her insurance should cover all your damage, then she should sue the other person who she’s claiming told her the coast was clear. She likely won’t get anywhere though, since flashing lights Is legally only recognised to warn of presence.

The point being simply that although HMRC and the Government may high ball the amount owed by a corporation, it seems unlikely they multiply their figure by 10.

&gt;

&gt;__Social desirability bias__ is the tendency of respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others. It can take the form of over-reporting ""good behavior"" or under-reporting ""bad,"" or undesirable behavior. The tendency poses a serious problem with conducting research with self-reports, especially questionnaires. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average tendencies as well as individual differences.

&gt;Topics where socially desirable responding (SDR) is of special concern are self-reports of abilities, personality, sexual behavior, and drug use. When confronted with the question ""How often do you [masturbate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation)?"", for example, respondents may be pressured by the societal taboo against masturbation, and either under-report the frequency or avoid answering the question. Therefore the mean rates of masturbation derived from self-report surveys are likely to be severe underestimates.

&gt;When confronted with the question, ""Do you use drugs/illicit substances?"" the respondent may be influenced by the fact that [controlled substances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance), including the more commonly used [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana), are generally illegal. Respondents may feel pressured to deny any drug use or rationalize it, e.g., ""I only smoke marijuana when my friends are around."" The bias can also influence reports of number of sexual partners. In fact, the bias may operate in opposite directions for different subgroups: Whereas men tend to inflate the numbers, women tend to underestimate theirs. In either case, the mean reports from both groups are likely to be distorted by social desirability bias.

&gt;Other topics that are sensitive to social desirability bias:

&gt;


&gt;* Personal [income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income) and earnings, often inflated when low and deflated when high.

&gt;* Feelings of low [self-worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem) and/or powerlessness, often denied.

&gt;* [Excretory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretory_system) functions, often approached uncomfortably, if discussed at all.

&gt;* Compliance with medicinal dosing schedules, often inflated.

&gt;* [Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), often either avoided or uncomfortably approached.

&gt;* [Patriotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism), either inflated or, if denied, done so with a fear of other party's judgement.

&gt;* [Bigotry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry) and [intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration), often denied, even if it exists within the responder.

&gt;* Intellectual achievements, often inflated.

&gt;* Physical appearance, either inflated or deflated

&gt;* Acts of real or imagined physical [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence), often denied.

&gt;* Indicators of charity or ""benevolence,"" often inflated.

&gt;* Illegal acts, often denied.

However those sales are ridiculously busy. I remember logging on at the exact time they were due for sale and was instantly put in an online queue for well over an hour. Ended up without any tickets for any game.

With a membership though you are better placed to get tickets rather than a normal member of the general public. The season just gone I found it easier to obtain tickets waiting until the club released any spare tickets to members only sales for each individual game.

In answer, its not necessarily harder for newer members, you have the same chance really.

Bull.

We cannot afford overpaying like crazy, like Chelsea and City can. We can't identify any player in the world and just throw money at his club until they let us at him. We also can't convince players who are getting regular playtime at clubs like Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, etc. to come to us unless the club wants them out.

Not that it really mattered, my brother and I were never NOT going to follow the family team. Some of my fondest childhood memories are me staying up late (we live in NZ) at my grandparents house with them, my dad, my brother and my uncle all watching the football. It was really when I got to high school that I started really getting into other sports. Obviously I always played football in my childhood, but I wasn't too bad at rugby. In fact, I was definitely better at rugby than I was at football but I never liked it that much. Anyway, I started getting into sports like baseball and basketball more than I had done previously. By uni I was sports mad, didn't matter what was on telly, I was always watching some kind of sport in my spare time. So I started picking teams to support, based on really anything that crossed my mind.

Football: Everton (naturally), any Bundesliga team (lived in Germany for a bit), New York Red Bulls (because of Tim Cahill), Toronto FC (because of Ryan Nelsen, former NZ captain), Wellington Phoenix (closest A-league team), Birkenhead United (my dad's old club)

Basketball: Toronto Raptors (I like dinosaurs), New Zealand Breakers (local NBL team)

Baseball: LA Dodgers (got an old dodgers jacket at a thrift shop, thought they had cool colours)

Rugby League: Warriors (local NRL team)

Rugby Union: Auckland Blues (local Super Rugby team)

American Football: Cowboys (found an old Cowboys jersey at a thrift shop, thought it was comfy)

It just makes a game more interesting when you have a team to cheer for. Next up thinking of picking an ice-hockey team to follow. Never really watched it before as it's not that popular in NZ but I always thought it was a cool sport. Any suggestions from them US/Canadian blues?

I LOVE this shade.  It glides on so smoothly and I feel very comfortable wearing it.  As someone else said in this sub, it is neutral, but not exactly a MLBB either.  Would be a good starter lipstick for those wishing to branch out beyond MLBBs or I think it would be very suitable in an office environment.  I would say the wear time isn't exactly the best, but I am a bit obsessive over checking my lipstick so touch ups aren't really an issue for me.  As far as I can tell it is not drying.

Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10.

We have a midtable defense, but I don't think that's because of our individual defenders, at least not the central ones. Skrtel, Agger, Sakho, and Kolo are are capable players, and with the exception of Skrtel's own goals and Kolo's occasional lapses, they're not particularly error-prone. Leadership might be an issue, but a greater problem is the wide defending.

Cissokho actually was a competent defender for us, but was generally poor going forward, which didn't fit for Rodgers. On the other side, Johnson was all over the place this season and was culpable for more than a few goals. If we could upgrade both fullback positions, while still retaining some depth (Flanagan, Enrique, maybe Wisdom), I think it would go a long way to strengthening our defense.

Defensive mid, especially if Lucas leaves, is also a priority. Wide forward, I think, could go either way. On the surface, it looks like we only have 5 players for 3 spots (Suarez, Sturridge, Sterling, Borini, Coutinho sometimes). With Suso and Ibe coming back, we might be able to see them in these spots, but it would be a gamble to rely on them too much, given their youth and inexperience.

Goalkeeper is up in the air, I think. It's probably not a priority, but if we could get a better backup than Jones, that would probably be wise. ",0,1401193879,null,0,false,0,chs6123,t3_26llqo,t1_chs6123,t3_26llqo,null,1433972796,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"I'm sorry, but for all the harrumphing about dodgy stats and twisted narratives, this guy is as bad as the press that he's complaining about.

Firstly, the vote share compared to the last local council elections is not a like for like comparison.  The last set of local elections didn't have London, this one did.  As even UKIP have noted, London isn't a particularly pro-UKIP area for all sorts of demographic reasons, therefore it's probably reasonable to assume that by including London their vote share would decrease.  They still polled more than the lib dems, which is a big deal no matter how you looks at it.  

Secondly, when he's going on about the London vs rest of UK angle (which I agree is a bit shonky) he then proceeds to cherry pick the few London boroughs that did pick UKIP councillors and then compares them to the big cities in the north that didn't vote UKIP.  I'm not sure what point he's trying to make.  Havering and Bexley are quite far outside of London, and are perhaps better compared to satellite towns around Manchester than to Manchester itself.  It's still worth noting that UKIP won fewer than 1% of seats in the London Boroughs, vs around 4% nationally.

Thirdly, I don't think anyone expected UKIP to win anything in central manchester or Leeds?  UKIP's target demographic doesn't live in large urban centres.  People living in central manc/leeds with probably be younger, wealthier and a bit more cosmopolitain than average, and hence wouldn't vote UKIP nearly as much.  There may also be larger immigrant populations in the big urban centres which wouldn't exactly help their cause.

Finally, he doesn't agree ukip are dangerous to labour.  I did a rough tally using the results here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_local_elections,_2014 and, as far as I could see, more than half of the seats that ukip won were in labour held councils.  If you leave out London Then UKIP won around 6% of the seats in what are primarily labour controlled councils.  He goes on at the end to assert that ukip damaged the tories more than labour, but doesn't give any information to back this assertion up at all.

There's a good book out recently about the rise of UKIP by a pair of political science professors (called revolt on the right), which has more data and information than this guy, and they largely argue that the average ukip voter is an older working class white male living in a post industrial town somewhere.  That's a lot of old labour support.  Frankly, I'd take their analysis over his any day, since he seems to rather have his own view that he'd like to imprint onto the results.

EDIT:  And why he has to bring up the rotherham ukip adoption story is beoyond me.  It's simply down to the local labour party basically being a corrupt oligarchy and ukip being the only opposition in the area (tories still can't get votes there due to thatcher).",0,1401193962,null,0,1401194889,0,chs61si,t3_26lh75,t1_chs61si,t3_26lh75,null,1433972806,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Most Christians reject some of the commandments in the Old Testament, but not all of them, and there are several bits of the New Testament that have frequently been interpreted as criticising homosexuality.  Most of the largest Christian groups tend to be overtly homophobic, including the Roman Catholic church (who recently actively opposed a UN resolution calling for homosexuality to be decriminalised), the Orthodox churches, and many Protestant ones.  Some other Protestant denominations (such as the Anglicans, Lutherans, and Presbyterians) are on the fence and constantly arguing about how to treat LGBT people.  The only Christian groups I know of that are uniformly accepting of LGBT people are the ones set up by and for LGBT people, like the Metropolitan Community Church and so on.

Lastly, Muslims do not only look the Qu'ran for advice. They also receive instruction from various books about Muhammad's actions called hadith.

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"The supposed budget was £60m wasn't it? I agree with you positional needs yet would add an attacking mid to the list. Every man and his dog knows we are after Lallana.

Couple of things. Clyne is no better than Flanagan and certainly not worth anywhere near £15m. Lucas is anything but overrated. 

LB - Rodriguez is probably the best one out there but I doubt we'll be in for him. Luis is 28 and not worth £20m-£30m IMO. Maxwell made the WC squad ahead of him. He is solid but nothing special. Moreno seems to be the best and most likely option. Fee approx. £15m. 

RB - I would sell Johnson while we can still get a fee for him. £5m is probably the best we could hope for. Aurier would be a fantastic signing. People assume he'll go to Arsenal but that remains to be seen. I would bust a gut to get him. Fee approx. £12m-£15m.

DM - Can for £12m. He could be rotated in slowly. We have Lucas who can fill in for Gerrard when he needs resting. Of course I would love us to sign a guy like Fernando or Parejo but we probably don't need them. We seem to be keen on Can. He would probably suffice.

CAM - If Lallana's price keeps rising I would go for Rakitic. Signing him would probably negate the need for Can also as Rakitic can play anywhere in the midfield. He will be in high demand but I think he's in a contract year so he wouldn't go for full market value. £20m or so would probably be enough. I would covet this signing over any other this summer. He is that good.

LW/S - Shaqiri for £15m would be an amazing purchase yet unlikely. Tello I don't think is good enough. Our interest in Kono seems to have cooled. So I would go for Remy for £8m. He could operate as 3rd choice striker or play on the LW. A proven Prem goalscorer (on a shit team) in his prime. Attitude issues don't bother me at all. BR is a fine man-manager who would have Remy out of the squad and training on his own if he started fucking about. Pretty sure he'd wake up quick and knuckle down like the rest of the lads.

Speroni on a free for backup GK is a fair shout. I would go for Vorm for £5m.

If we are intent on selling either Agger or Skrtel I would expect us to sign someone like Lovren. After Kompany and Terry I would have placed Lovren 3rd best CB in the Prem last year. 24, established int'l, proven performer in the league and an upgrade over what we have. This one is a big 'IF' and probably won't happen. BR may just stick with what we have at CB.

So by my pipedream that's Moreno, Aurier, Can, Rakitic, Remy and Vorm signing for approx. £75m.

Sell/Release Johnson, Aspas, Coady, Jones, Kelly and Assaidi. Net gains probably only about £17m. £58m total spend.

Suso, Borini and Wisdom should return to the squad. Alberto, Ibe and Ilori need to be loaned out.

I'll go out on a limb and predict we'll sign maybe 1 of my 6 signings. ",0,1401196081,null,0,1401196377,0,chs6mp3,t3_26llqo,t1_chs6mp3,t3_26llqo,null,1433973145,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

I don't think it is, really.

You know, interestingly, Islam does not see itself as oppressive of women. Islam doesn't believe that woman are worse. They believe that women have a different position and a different role in society. For instance, many Muslims don't like their daughters to become educated or work, because that is supposed to be the role of men, and the girl should marry a guy who will take care of her. But in the household, the women often rule, and they certainly rule in terms of raising the children. Women are to cover up in the ninja costume or head dress to prevent losing their modesty. They are to stay virgins so that they will be desirable to potential husbands (thus ensuring her a good future). There are many oddities like this clearly separating men and women - such as that men are not allowed to wear gold jewellery, since this is for women. Also consider that it is traditional for the husband and his family to pay the bride and her family for the marriage - this is meant to ensure the womans financial security for if the husband dies. 

So Islam, in a twisted way, actually does set out to protect women (admittedly from themselves because they aren't capable, bless 'em)

REVENUE &amp; CUSTOMS
Pliant compliance
 
CHANCELLOR George Osborne's response to the dawning realisation that Britain is now a tax haven for the biggest companies and richest people is to claim increasing success in the war on tax dodging. In his recent budget speech he boasted: ""We're collecting twice as much [tax] as before through compliance lie investigation].""

Closer inspection of the numbers, however, reveals this is baloney.

Last year HM Revenue &amp; Customs claimed that the yield from its ""compliance"" activities was £20.7bn, a big dent in the £50bn-plus that it (conservatively) reckons goes missing before these efforts. But the smallprint reveals that more than half the supposed haul, £11.8bn, is not money going into the exchequer to fund public services as the government implies. It is something altogether different, called ""revenue protected"", and is the unproven benefit of future tax payments that would not be made if HMRC had not got on a taxpayer's case. One insider describes it as ""wishful thinking"".

The figures thus inflated are then used to claim that HMRC's performance has improved. Osborne's budget boast was based on expected yield of £100bn over this parliament compared to £52bn in the last government's five years. But the £100bn includes the ""wishful thinking"", whereas up to 2009/10 the yield was entirely ""additional [tax] liability assessed"", ie just what errant taxpayers had been asked to cough up already. On a like-for-like comparison, performance in fact appears to be declining. Let's hope taxpayers enter more honest figures on their returns.",0,1401196730,null,0,false,0,chs6ts5,t3_26lpmq,t1_chs6ts5,t3_26lpmq,null,1433973239,5,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,5

true,rosscatherall,eng-TyneWear,Zoocastle,"I think a lot of the youth around Newcastle get away with a lot without intervention from the police. 

A few years ago I was at the general hospital with a friend who had fallen and split his eyebrow open. We left the hospital at around 2am and we were immediately followed by a group of youths who were drinking vodka on the street. Within a few minutes a number of them jumped on my friend, dragged him to the floor and started laying in the kicks. I'm a lot smaller than my friend is, so maybe that's the reason why they didn't see me as a target.

I got on the phone to the police and when they established that that's what I was doing, I too was dragged to the floor and suffered a number of kicks. 

By the time the police arrived my friend was half way down the street, he had managed to shut himself inside a phone box. The police approached myself and refused to intervene to help my friend. I was threatened with arrest for going to try and help him. The police waited until the youths dispersed on their own accord before going to help him, at which point we were taking by ambulance straight back to the hospital. No attempts were made to pursue the youths.

I wish that was just a one off, but it's not. I've faced problems with youths hanging around drinking on the streets of North Shields, in which I was attacked with a large metal pole. The police never responded.

I've been attacked by a group of youths on Tynemouth beach and we were attacked with a metal kosh. 

This time they did catch one of them. His punishment was to write a letter of apology to myself. 

On my first trip to the city centre without my parents at the age of 14/15, I went in to do some Christmas shopping. I was mugged on Northumberland street, in broad daylight. I was pushed up against a shop window and forced to hand over what little money I had. A couple of people tried intervening, but the attacker claimed that I stole the money off him earlier in the day, even though this man was a good 5/6 years older than myself and I was obviously pretty distressed. On hearing his made up explanation though, the crowds dispersed and nobody cared, save for one elderly man, who insisted that I take his pound coin.

My opinion on the matter is that the current level of privatisation in the rail network completely fails to take advantage of the key characteristic that makes private companies great for consumers - real competition.

How to make that happen with a rail network, I don't know, but the way things are running now, the government is subsidising most of the network a huge amount, whilst having to maintain so much regulation to try and keep fares at a reasonable level and keep the trains safe. All the while, the private companies are funnelling profits into the pockets of shareholders without any fear of going out of business.

So essentially, the taxpayers are paying for it, and the customers are paying for it, and the shareholders and top level managers are making loads of money from it. And our train service is still sub-par. So what exactly are we as taxpayers or as consumers getting out of it being privatised in the first place?

actually nepotism only applies to relatives, and your assertion of them all being pally is conjecture.

&gt;legal costs &lt;&lt; tax liability

Not when you factor in the risk that the court doesnt disagree with their interpretation of tax law, and HMRC losing.

&gt;especially since big companies could tie a case up in courts for decades for the price of their tax liability and HMRC would never pursue a case for that long.

Which would be impossible for a company to do in this legal system if there was a solid case against them. The point being that there isn't a solid case and the tax HMRC demands isn't always legally due

&gt;Bingo! This is exactly why companies pay as little as they do: they know that HMRC will cut a deal for the fraction of what they're legally liable to pay because HMRC can't afford the time and money it would take to pursue the amount they're owed.

No that's not why, they pay so little because the law is both vague and gives big companies a lot of concessions, any case where it was simply unpaid indisputeable tax it it would be easy and relatively cheap to take them on in court, and they would cough up because theres no point wasting legal fees on a lost cause.

The law is only as useful as it's interpretation in court, a lot of these cases rest on definitions that have yet to be tested in court, until a judgement is reached neither HMRC nor the company can truly say whether or not the tax is owed.

This way, the easy path is to automatically save without thinking about it, which is probably what is in your best interest in the long run.

Furthermore if the money goes out of your account as soon as you get paid then you won't ever feel like you have the money that you put away each month, and you will get used to living within whatever income you have chosen to leave yourself.

&gt; In Malta, however, Catholic bishops opposed efforts to remove homosexual acts from the criminal code; something which was finally done in 1973. In New Zealand, Cardinal Williams issued in 1985 a statement opposing homosexual law reform, arguing that ""to decriminalize homosexuality could suggest to some people that it was morally and socially permissible""; but the Church there declined to submit a formal response to the parliamentary enquiry. In later years, the local Catholic Church opposed or took action against decriminalization of homosexuality in Belize. In India, too, the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council opposed decriminalisation, but Cardinal Oswald Gracias, a President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India and one of the eight members of Pope Francis's Council of Cardinal Advisers, declared it wrong to make gay people criminals, since the Catholic Church ""teaches that homosexuals have the same dignity of every human being and condemns all forms of unjust discrimination, harassment or abuse"". Homosexuality remains illegal in Belize and India. In Nigeria, Cardinal John Onaiyekan was thought to have tacitly approved of a May 2013 bill criminalizing same-sex relationships and participation in gay rights organizations.

&gt; The Holy See, an observer at the United Nations, opposed both informally and formally a 2008 proposed declaration urging the decriminalization of ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"", which are punishable by law in many countries, including some where it incurs a death sentence. In an interview published on 1 December 2008, Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the Holy See's representative at the United Nations General Assembly, said of the proposed declaration that it ""asked for the addition of new categories to be protected against discrimination without taking into account that, if adopted, these would create terrible new discriminations"" such as, he said, pillorying and pressuring of states that do not recognize as marriage a union between persons of the same sex.

They have also been strongly opposed to anti-discrimination laws, same-sex marriage or any other form of legal recognition of same-sex relationships, and allowing LGBT people to adopt children.  As I understand it, they are also very attached to the idea of the gender binary, so they reject the existence of trans people altogether, and say pretty nasty things about intersex and non-gender-conforming people.",0,1401200020,null,0,false,0,chs7xae,t3_26l83y,t1_chs7xae,t1_chs79gr,null,1433973756,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Not to mention the fact he completely two-footed. Also not to mention his workrate is equal if not better than Hendersons. 

People are raving about Willian being a great signing, he's nowhere near the player Lallana is, his finishing and final ball are not as good, and his decision making on counter attacks is very poor. His biggest strength is technique and his workrate... Something on par with Lallana. 

If Willian is worth £32 million, Lallana is definitely worth 30 mil. No it won't be a bargain, but in comparison to other signings he's no worse. 

The players I see people suggesting are better than him are just not true; 

Shaqiri? No chance. Has a poor touch under pressure, disappears unless the team is performing well and doesn't have the workrate to play consistently anywhere but central. 

Bernard? Come on, completely unproven talent that looks like a child next to even Neymar.

a) He's expensive and City aren't paying part of his wages now. I think its now £120k a week and he isn't worth that. 
b) he's getting old so his value and performance isn't likely to rise much above what it is so will start to droop. Also if we want to make a challenge to the top 4 for the next decade at least we could do with a solid long term striker (a new Defoe type figure) who is fairly young and who we can rely on or build a team around for a season or more.
c) if we don't sell him, we risk not signing him next year (because he wants more money than we will throw at him) and loosing him on a free
d) I don't feel confident playing him. He blows hot and cold. He can be a 10/10 unbeatable machine.....but he can be a lumbering wasteful lazy player who doesn't go after the ball.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"What you don't seem to be getting is that RP was pushed as the ""proper"" way to speak English for many years. It was created roughly based on how well off educated people in the south of England spoke. Yet it was an artificial standardisation created for the purposes of broadcast, since there was still variation amongst those groups of speakers. 

When it was the broadcast standard it affected the accents of many people especially those who wished to portray themselves as educated and well off. For this reason in more modern times it gained a stigma as a bit silly, most RP speakers toned down their accents because very conservative RP sounds comical. 

Because the standardisation was based on a certain demographic it has inexorable class and also regional associations, owing to the fact that the south east has been the wealthiest part of the UK for a long time. 

Nowadays people are vehemently against the idea of there being a ""Standard British Accent"" because it's supporting the idea that some very ancient regional speech mannerisms are inherently wrong. Nowadays in advertising it's plain to see that natural sounding accents with some remaining regional traits increase sales by seeming more trustworthy and honest. That said what you hear on television are very much watered down educated regional accents to ensure they are understood by everyone. You're far less likely to hear genuinely thick accents, the Lucazade ad you put up could be considered an exception, because the voice actor has a quite strong London urban ethnic accent, which was probably chosen to appeal to a young market due to it's ""cool"" perception.

I'll also add that some products do still advertise with modernised RP accents, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2B_JTb1mKM) because they're making a product that will appeal mostly to middle class older shoppers and want to appear classy and traditional. However you're not going to sell to youth demographics or budget markets this way. Arguable there is a broadcast standard still which is something like a mix of RP and EE, either a very watered down RP or an EE accent that's been made more standardised to the point it no longer screams London. This could be considered something like a neutral southern accent, insofar as you'd be able to tell the speaker was vaguely from the south of England but not know whereabouts.

Are you not 'suppositioning' the EU has anything to learn from this? I would suggest that national leaders and EU leaders try and establish why votes worked the way they did.

&gt;Devastating how?

By using Share of Electorate, rather than Share of Vote, you are drawn to the fact that almost no one voted for Anti-EU (rather than the merkier to define Euroskeptic) parties. This, for example, is the UK;

- Eligible electorate: 46.3million
- Number of valid votes: 16.4million (35.4% turnout)
- Vote share of UKIP: 26.60% (4.36million)
- **Percentage of eligible electorate voting UKIP: 9.4%**

That is to say, more than 9 in 10 eligible voters do not want what UKIP wants (enough to vote for them), or to lend their support in order to protest for whatever reason.

Or to put it another way, only 1 in 10 people gave UKIP support on any angle, including Anti-EU or protest. ",0,1401202801,null,0,1401203132,0,chs9108,t3_26iidj,t1_chs9108,t1_chs8ku6,null,1433974276,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Dembele is definitely a bit of an odd-man when you look at him in the previous spurs set-up. He was being told to hang a little deeper and look to link Eriksen with the ball whenever he could. It didn't help him with form when Bentaleb was promoted, and Siggy was fighting for field time. They're arguably similar players, where Siggy can go on the left side as well. Dembele's strengths are usually overlooked because they aren't the flashy things Eriksen does. 


If Poch wants to keep Holtby and Siggy, Dembele will be sold... but if Holtby is to go (as mentioned in other comments), I don't see him as a bad option for you guys either. 

Criticism for Holtby: He is all engine and no brain Yeah, true to an extent. I saw more consistency from him with when he went on loan to Fulham than at Spurs. He is definitely a creative type, but does lack that defensive awareness in his game that Spurs required with Eriksen's defensive duties eliminated. It either has to be diminished in his role, or trained up. To be honest, I don't see much future for him at Spurs with the intake of our miserable transfer window last summer and sitting slightly behind Siggy for pecking rights.

&gt;Lallana is more of a CAM

He's really not, he's played equal games LW,RW,CAM, he drifts inside but his workrate is high enough to play on the wing. 

&gt;But £30m is ridiculous for a guy with only 1 top Prem season behind him

But it's a reasonable price for foreign players completely unproven in the Premier League? 

&gt;Last time we paid out £30m + for a guy with only one good season under his belt it didn't work out too well

Everybody knew Andy Carrolls ability ends at being a target man, get the ball in the air in the box to him and he'll score, that's it. He's fucking good at that, but that's it.

Even looking at Downing, his strengths were almost exclusively his crossing.

So I don't think it's fair to compare them to Lallana, who is one of the most technical and versatile English players we've had for some time, and whose ability allows him to be used in a multitude of different ways.

I can't stress how much of an important factor it is having a player who can play anywhere across the front-line and is completely two footed and technically fantastic in a team like Liverpools, especially with CL football.

Just think the options he gives you in lining up your team for a CL game, especially when you have other versatile players like Hendo, Raheem, Coutinho who can play different positions, and Suarez/Sturridge who can drift from strikers to the wing, and Suarez can be CAM as well..

Which to me goes to show that this 'sliding' scale of fitness tests for different ages is a bad idea. A 50+ person will need the same abilities as a twenty something in that job. The idea of optionally staying on after hitting the retirement age is a great one, but for it to be appropriate, the retirement age needs to be substantially lower in a similar manner to the armed forces. People who hit 40 and are both able and willing to continue, no doubt do, and that's great for them... but the police have no such luxury.

Making *everyone* work until they are 60 with that expectation, as is current with the police (and the fire service - my line of work) is a mistake.

I will always remember when the doctor was me,"" it took Matt smith 32 seconds in order to complete this line (end time of the line being 3 minutes and 29 seconds in that particular video).  

Looking at his video (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llJPKvQklzs#t=13) he completes the same line in 30 seconds (end time at 43 seconds into his video). A 2 second differential, even when someone is eyeballing the video timer for evidence, is more than enough time to conclude that these have a high probability of being separate readings of the same lines. 

Plus if you watch the videos side by side you can kind of tell that his impression, although amazing is very slightly off in things like voice inflection and tone.

If they are indeed the same then it will become apparent very quickly.

Short answer, no. Long answer, yes, but it's an inelegant and possibly unworkable solution. 

A dump box or broadcast delay system acts as a buffer for a radio show. They store up the last 10 seconds (or thereabouts) of the show from the studio and feed that out to the transmitter (or next device in the broadcast chain). Normally there is a big red button with DUMP on it somewhere next to the presenter or the producer. When they want to filter something out, be it swearing, or more usually coughing/sneezing/mispronouncing a word/a particularly loud fart/whatever, they will switch the headphones to a broadcast feed, then wait for a gap in between words and hit dump. The machine will dump the last ten seconds of the show, and switch the studio output to live broadcast. They can then carry on talking as if nothing ever happened, and the listener is none the wiser that anything is missing or has been censored. The machine can then rebuild its buffer during quiet spots in between words. 

If you do something similar on TV, you need to ensure that everything is in exactly the same position visually when you hit dump as it was ten seconds ago. I'm not experienced in live TV broadcasting, but this sounds difficult, if not impossible to make sure that the presenter doesn't jitter about, and it isn't a seamless or invisible changeover like on radio. It's also going to be trickier, because the presenter down't have the same level of control and the producer isn't as close, so it's going to be more difficult to pull off.  Same goes for muting the audio for a few seconds, you're going to notice what happened.

This system discards every vote which wasn't for the winner, and is why in 2010 the tories got 47% of the seats with 36% of the votes, and the Lib Dems got nearly 9% of the seats with 23% of the votes.

true,to-infinity,null,null,"Great post, we need more discussion based posts like this. Good job! 

Anyway I'll get going.

1. Top priority in my eyes is right back. Johnson, who I've always said was the best attacking fullback in the league, was just woeful this year. I rarely watch Ligue 1 so Aurier, although I know is decent, isn't who I'd chose. De Sciglio on the other hand would be my first choice without a shadow of doubt.  Two footed, quick, wicked crosses, young and has had a few seasons at Milan now. I think he'll be desperate for CL football and I expect Milan to have a clearout this summer anyway. £15m should do it. For a player who can player either side is a bargain. This may seem controversial but I'm not going to get a left back. I think Enrique will be fine coming back from injury and if not De Sciglio to left back and probably Flanno in until January when we can get a new left back. Risky but one I'd be willing to take on the chin if I was wrong. I'd also sell Johnson. Wisdom, Flanno and Kelly are all capable replacements.  

2. Gerrard is getting old and I don't think his legs will like a 45-50 game season which we'll get next year and frankly I don't think Lucas is up to it. I'd let Lucas go to the highest bidder, likely to be Inter, and get in a younger replacement who is apt with the ball at their feet with some mobility, which Gerrard does lack now. Can is good, I've seen him play and has impressed me. Very very versatile, could fill in in front on Gerrard alongside Hendo, Coutinho or Allen and obviously would be used in the regista role in rotation with Gerrard. I can see him becoming a long term starter if we do decide to buy him. £12m seems to be the figure being stated so we'll go with that.

3. Shaqiri or Greizmann. Both young exciting players with CL experience I don't see what can go wrong to be honest. Shaqiri is more of a Sterling-esque player with blistering pace and a very direct mindset. Not to mention his howitzer of a leg leg. Greizmann, whilst also possessing these qualities, perhaps slightly less pace, is a much better architect of chances and will assist more than score. I am torn between the two but I'd be more inclined to go for Greizmann as he played more last season. £15m-£18m would see him with us I should think. Call it £17m. 

4. Now I have £6m left, but I've sold Lucas and Johnson. Say £14m for them combined, assuming I keep what I make on sales which has been mentioned a lot as something we'd get. £20m. Lovren would be my choice, he's been brilliant this season. Only 24 so has a good 7-8 years left in him, he's premier league proven and a solid international player. My preferred partnership would be Lovren and Sakho with Skrtel on the bench with Kolo, Wisdom, Kelly as backup. Agger, as much as I love him, would be sold to the highest bidder who isn't in the Premiership. So Lovren for £10-12m and Agger out for the same amount. 

5. A player who is Lallana-esque but not a stupid price. I would think £15m is the most I could spend here. Now I'd love a player like Rakatic or Herrera (from Bilbao) but I think they'd be closer to £20-25m so they're off the cards. I'm tempted by Valbuena of Marsielles, wonderfully talented technically and can play down the centre or on either wing. But another Frenchy is gonna be my pick. Grenier. Awesome player, he just reminds me of the white Pogba but less powerful. Great passer, works hard, versatile with international experience. Lyon are a shadow of what they once were and I think he'd jump to play at a club with Lovren (former Lyon teammate) Greizmann (Frenchy) and Sakho (French NT). £15m would be the most I'd go and could be ambitious but it's not real anyway. Maybe push the boat out and say £15-20m.

There we have it. 

In - De Sciglio (15m), Can (12m), Greizmann (17m), Lovren (12m) and Grenier (15-20m)
