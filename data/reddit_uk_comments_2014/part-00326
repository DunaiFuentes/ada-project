And how often have you bought a non-advance ticket that was of a standard type (i.e not a TOC special offer) and was TOC specific? Every anytime, off peak and super off peak I've ever bought has certainly had no restriction on TOC. No different to the BR days.

The key point that I was trying to make is that BR did not have one ticket for a given journey - they had time based ticketing too, just as today's train companies have, and if BR was around today with self-service ticket machines it may well have had the same issues as today's systems (including the one that the currently nationalised East Coast uses)

I'm impressed how many people seem unable to grasp my point - perhaps their blind and misguided desire to nationalise regardless of the actual benefits/downsides is getting in the way?

&gt; It was an essential piece of national infrastructure, rather than a system designed to maximise what could be extracted from the customer to the point that driving or even flying are more cost-effective.

The Lords allows some people who might not have the 'charisma' or the 'persuasion' skills of a career politician to still have some influence and power, if they were successful in their field.

Something as small as player a further slightly back (ie Oscar playing in a 4-3-3 instead of 4-2-3-1) can open up space between him and defenders holding a deeper line and allow him more freedom. Fundamentally a false 9 was only a slight change over where your striker plays but it altered the game massively. Something as simple as playing Oscar marginally further back could open up a game against a team set up in a certain way, the two styles may be similar but a single difference can be enough to alter a game in your favour.

1. I am missing both 10 and 11's wide eyed excitement about the adventures and about humanity. It is clear from the way they speak about humans that they adore the human race and are huge fans. Their enthusiasm and optimism made me want to believe in a better world and that just maybe if we get together the best of ourselves we can make this world a better place. The doctor was a source of inspiration to humanity (remember Martha going around the world to 'preach' about the doctor). This doctor is jaded and seems often to give up easily (he can save the universe millions of times but gives up because of trees) or he doesn't save the peripheral characters

2. The storylines have been too heavily focused on Earth and Clara and Danny's school. We enjoy watching the Show because of the wonderful possibilities of all of time and space to visit. Why have we spent so much of it in a school in East London? 

3. The doctor is no longer the clever, clever boy. A bit like House it was fun watching the story take us into what seemed like an impossible dead end with no way out, until the doctor gets the 'look' (like House does) and the epic music starts: da dum da da da dum dum dum (hope you remember what I'm talking about)... The horns and drums start playing the doctor rushes around and finds a very clever solution. In many of et episodes this season he doesn't seem to 'fix' anything at all, there is no exciting rushing around to save humanity. 
Would 10 or 11 have ever given up on even one life? Or on our planet at all in the face of some trees? I think we have our answer.
Capaldi as an actor could be good but the doctor has not behaved like the ones I know and love... Which makes me very sad.
Hope you guys agree.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"Sounds like you have selected some decent basic products! There are a few of us here liking that Simple toner and the Superdrug vitamin E hot cloth cleanser. That face wash should be fairly gentle going by the ingredients. I would say tho drop back to cleansing your face once per day at night, use the toner alone in the morning because your face won't be dirty. Too much washing can dry your skin out. 

Ideally you would have introduced one new product at a time, so you know what works and what does not. It would be useful to add an exfoliant at some point but not until you have established the other products suit and are not causing breakouts or other negative reactions. We will hopefully be doing a mega reviews thread on BHA/ AHA exfoliants in the next week or two which should be the ideal time for you.

The upper layer of the skin takes between one and two months to fully turnover, depending on age. That means positive results may well take up to two months to show, assuming you are using the right active ingredients for your skin type and issues.

Niacinamide is one of the best actives for excess sebum production, acne and supporting the skin barrier (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out). There is a some in one or two of your Simple products (definitely in the toner). Do check out our ingredients Wiki.

Forehead .... dry patches make me wonder if your shampoo is causing an issue. Even bubbles can be a problem for some people. You might try keeping it away from your face, or a gentler shampoo free of sulphates and other harsh anionic surfactants such as the olefin sulfonates.

Since your day moisturiser is very light and has sunscreen agents in, it would be best not to use that at night long term. You might consider the CeraVe PM mosituriser which is also lightweight but has niacinamide (again) and ceramides which help strengthen the skin barrier so reducing dryness. But as before only introduce one new product at a time.

Last thought is to review your diet and lifestyle, ensuring you consistently meet or exceed all our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Nutrition, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, weight, stress and so on can all affect how sensitive or dry the skin is, acne in some people, how well you heal and so on.

Emelio Gentile's definition of fascism:

&gt; 1. A mass movement with multiclass membership in which prevail, among the leaders and the militants, the middle sectors, in large part new to political activity, organized as a party militia, that bases its identity not on social hierarchy or class origin but on a sense of comradeship, believes itself invested with a mission of national regeneration, considers itself in a state of war against political adversaries and aims at conquering a monopoly of political power by using terror, parliamentary politics, and deals with leading groups, to create a new regime that destroys parliamentary democracy;
&gt; 
&gt; 2. An 'anti-ideological' and pragmatic ideology that proclaims itself antimaterialist, anti-individualist, antiliberal, antidemocratic, anti-Marxist, is populist and anticapitalist in tendency, expresses itself aesthetically more than theoretically by means of a new political style and by myths, rites, and symbols as a lay religion designed to acculturate, socialize, and integrate the faith of the masses with the goal of creating a 'new man';
&gt; 
&gt; 3. A culture founded on mystical thought and the tragic and activist sense of life conceived of as the manifestation of the will to power, on the myth of youth as artificer of history, and on the exaltation of the militarization of politics as the model of life and collective activity;
&gt; 
&gt; 4. A totalitarian conception of the primacy of politics, conceived of as an integrating experience to carry out the fusion of the individual and the masses in the organic and mystical unity of the nation as an ethnic and moral community, adopting measures of discrimination and persecution against those considered to be outside this community either as enemies of the regime or members of races considered to be inferior or otherwise dangerous for the integrity of the nation;
&gt; 
&gt; 5. A civil ethic founded on total dedication to the national community, on discipline, virility, comradeship, and the warrior spirit;
&gt; 
&gt; 6. A single state party that has the task of providing for the armed defense of the regime, selecting its directing cadres, and organizing the masses within the state in a process of permanent mobilization of emotion and faith;
&gt; 
&gt; 7. A police apparatus that prevents, controls, and represses dissidence and opposition, even by using organized terror;
&gt; 
&gt; 8. political system organized by hierarchy of functions named from the top and crowned by the figure of the 'leader,' invested with a sacred charisma, who commands, directs, and coordinates the activities of the party and the regime;
&gt; 
&gt; 9. Corporative organization of the economy that suppresses trade union liberty, broadens the sphere of state intervention, and seeks to achieve, by principles of technocracy and solidarity, the collaboration of the 'productive sectors' under control of the regime, to achieve its goals of power, yet preserving private property and class divisions;
&gt; 
&gt; 10. A foreign policy inspired by the myth of national power and greatness, with the goal of imperialist expansion.

Britain First certainly fits the bill rather well especially on the national myths, militarism, 'organised as a party militia', anti-ideological, anti-liberal, dedication to the national community defined on ethnic lines etc etc etc. ",0,1414803324,null,0,false,0,clpnp7f,t3_2krtxg,t1_clpnp7f,t1_cloion4,null,1426248877,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Not really... getting a lawyer to tell you if it's likely illegal is general due diligence with big business decisions like this.

This wouldn't be something the Police would likely deal with - it would have to go through the courts as you said before that.

The white working class all over the world has always tended to focus on nationalistic policies and forgotten what's good for themselves; it's an observation inherent in Marxism and the work of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theorists called False Consciousness:

&gt;For Marx, ideologies appear to explain and justify the current distribution of wealth and power in a society. In societies with unequal allocations of wealth and power, ideologies present these inequalities as acceptable, virtuous, inevitable, and so forth. Ideologies thus tend to lead people to accept the status quo. The subordinate people come to believe in their subordination: the peasants to accept the rule of the aristocracy, the factory workers to accept the rule of the owners, consumers the rule of corporations. This belief in one's own subordination, which comes about through ideology, is, for Marx, false consciousness.

&gt;That is, conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse people about their true aspirations, loyalties, and purposes.[2] Thus, for example, the working class has often been, for Marx, beguiled by nationalism, organized religion, and other distractions. These ideological devices help to keep people from realizing that it is they who produce wealth, they who deserve the fruits of the land, all who can prosper: instead of literally thinking for themselves, they think the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.

&gt;I don't feel you are in the right to disdain those of us who feel (and that's two-thirds of us remember) that we should question the role we have in the union

I'm not saying don't ask questions, I'm just saying that having a referendum every decade is an awful idea, and that the people who lost this vote are not respecting the fact that people voted no.

&gt;In my mind, we are junior partners in this union, just like Wales and NI, we've got a voice, but it's generally ignored, and we're treated like pseudo colonies

You have this view because you're taking a nationalist view, Scotland, England, NI, Wales. That's not accurate to the system we exist within though, as in reality we have our country (the UK) and 650 odd constituancies within it which are varied and all catered for by an MP. Scotland doesn't speak with one voice, nor does any arbitrary unit.

Who said I was a die-hard brit?

Talk about condescending! As if because I'm pro-union I don't give a fuck about Scotland or the people in it. You give tremendous insight into your view of No voters with that sentence, and it's a very mean spirited, negative, unfair one.

Wrong impression.

Toure: crazy to label him as a miss, was brought in for peanuts to provide experience and cover. He's done exactly that and provided some laughs along the way. A couple of big mistakes aside he's been fairly faultless. 



Cissokho: wasn't the quality we needed again was brought in to act as a short term stop gap and provide cover until we got a LB in and Enrique was fit again. Was never meant to be more than that so it worked out alright in the end.

false,mrmessiah,null,null,"You know, it's incredibly wierd to look back at an Argos catalogue from the year I was born. Page after page of pictures of... stuff, lovingly arranged against desaturated coloured backdrops lit in that late 70s way where the light seems to fall off just as it leaves the frame, as if the rest of the world was darkness apart from where they pointed the camera. 

And it's much the same stuff you find in the modern Argos catalogue, except everything is slightly different, slightly wrong. Nothing about the design of anything says in an overt way ""1976"" except in the fact that it's designed to a totally different aesthetic template to the world of now. A plate is patterened a bit too gaudily. An iron resembles its own all-metal ancestors rather than the plastic, semi-transparent irons of today. All the powertools are the wrong colour, not ergonomic enough, chunky in a way that says ""cumbersome"" as much as it says ""solid"". Pictures of all the same things, in a different visual language. You understand it, but you have to translate it in your mind first.

And yet, it's the stuff I remember. The clock that's a rounded-square shape, the type of rounded square they don't make clocks any more, they were everywhere in the late 70s. My nan had one in her kitchen. I remember a day when it snowed and me and my mum walked round to her house, and she made us a hot drink while I pulled off my wellies. And I remember looking at a clock just like that one on the wall above the kitchen table. I remember nothing else from that day, my mind has long forgotten every other detail in the intervening 35 years, why we were going there, what we talked about, what time it was, even, but I remember looking up and seeing a clock just like that one.

The upright hoover, with the cloth bag hanging there, and the light on the front... there's one in my mum and dad's loft. The one that, as a kid, was so loud for a few years I was scared of hoovers, and used to have nightmares I was being chased by a giant hoover. It never actually broke, they just couldn't get the bags for it any more and being slightly hoardy, they just kept it, because I saw it the other month when I went up there to clear out bags of my old clothes. Theirs is beaten around and covered in dust, the one in the catalogue is brand new, for all we look at it now and think ""old"". This was all new stuff when they printed this catalogue. When they lit that scene against a blue background because blue makes us think of ""clean"", took the photo, photoset it into the page and thought ""this looks just right"". And then thousands of people looking through that catalog thought ""ooh yes, a lovely new hoover, one of those nice powerful electric ones, that'll do the job"", and they took the bus into town and filled out the form with the little pens, paid for it with money that looked different to ours, and bought it home all happy that they'd bought a lovely new hoover, that people had made in a factory, to a design that was the best they could do, that did the job nicely and was going to be a great seller that year. Who got paid for the work they did making the hoovers, and went home from the hoover factory and watched Coronation Street just like we do now. Most of the people that have ever bought that hoover have thrown it away by now, thousands of defunct hoovers gone to the tip whether they still worked or not. I don't know if the people that made the hoovers, or took the pictures for the catalogue are even still alive or remember the work they did that day (I doubt it.) I'm aware I've just written a huge paragraph about hoovers, but when you start to think about the passage of time and all the little different strands of it you can get carried away.

Imagine all those things, in the context of the late 70s, what they were when they were created, who created them, where they went, the events that took place around them. Not the big events, necessarily, the myriad small and petty events of everyday life going on. An Argos catalogue in every home.

I look at this catalogue and part of how I feel is the difference of it all, how strange it all seems, how life then is different to life now. But every so often there's something that triggers a memory, and then I start feeling familiarity instead. A part of my life that has gone, never to be recovered, that I don't necessarily remember completely but can never fully forget. 

Time is such a strange, strange thing.

Lose your job or need to cut back - a renter can downsize almost instantly and save money. Someone with a mortgage is fucked when they lose their job and may lose their house. And the opposite too - if I get a better job, or come into some money - a renter can change property in a month and go to a nicer place.

We have charities such as the NSPCC basically campaigning against men and fathers, and all sorts of groups and politicians suggesting fathers are a danger to their own children and using fraudulent statements to make the ""case"" that we shouldn't have shared parenting. Therefore when women murder their own kids it's more than legitimate to post such news, more even more so when they do so using such horrible methods, and more so again when there's possible custody issues on the horizon.

As for the final link, I firmly stand by that too as it shows a child far exceeding the policing abilities of not one but two trained WPCs working together. It therefore makes a hugely compelling case against lowering standards in the police and thus effectively discriminating against the best candidates by failing to recognise and take advantage of their much needed and obvious abilities.

So that's that then? Given that we *just* had a referendum to see if we wanted ""more""?

&gt;I apologise for calling you an extremist, it's just you're the only Scot I know who doesn't view his own country as a country, it's a fringe belief

It's complicated, more so than easily comprehended by those who haven't given it much thought (not implying you there, just, most people). Scotland is a historical country, and Scotland is generally considered a country within UK terms, however the UK is a sovereign nation state, which is really what, internationally, most people are using the term ""country"" to be shorthand for. Scotland is a country in our unique UK terminology, but not in the conventional international sense. That's not something which is really open to agreement, it's just a statement of fact - Scotland is not a nation state.

I feel that the common practise of referring to Scotland as a country within the union is carried out a great deal by nationalists who want to make it seem like somehow there's this unified body of England, Scotland, NI, and Wales within the UK and that's that, but I have no less or more in common with a man from Glasgow than I do with a man from Liverpool. England doesn't get one big vote on everything, Scotland, NI and Wales each a much smaller vote on everything, we each get our vote and we all get our representatives.

Is there ever a good argument for secession? Certainly, but I don't agree with the case put forward for secession of any part of northern Britain right now, and especially not for secession along the lines of a nation state which hasn't been around for 300 years and is scarcely more ethnically, culturally, or economically distinct from the rest of the UK.

&gt;all I ask of you is to try not and hate the Scottish people when they start wanting greater autonomy.

I'm not sure if you intended that to insult me, but it seems that way.

He's also failed to field a consistent back 4 after Mangala was fit to play, which is no doubt having an impact on his game.

Certain players such as Milner, Lamps, Aguero, Silva and Joe himself have been playing outstandingly well, while others are hungry to prove themselves or are performing at least adequately on average. We've only looked truly useless as a unit against West Ham, Newcastle and in the CL (and even then, I remember Joe and Dinho being great against Bayern) and the rest of the time it's just been a few players being useless and bringing down the rest of the team. I don't personally think that the whole team was terrible in any game other than maybe West Ham, Roma and just now against Newcastle.

Honestly, most of the time, it's a stupid and reactionary move to blame your manager for any problems, but Pelle's team selection and stubbornness to drop anyone (except for Hart) have been quite a factor in our poor form and Silva's injury is proof of that. 

Hats off to Joe for saying this, but saying that Pelle isn't at fault in any of this is just totally wrong.

It's designed for money to flow up, and shit flow down.

 This news in particular has made  me loose all trust just because the whole system seems to rigged. When you hear something like only 25 mps discuss drug legislation out of over 600 you wonder who is number one in the th.ir eye's r. Where are the public representatives who can give an objective view run an inquiry. That ay will probably beat the police record response time so far in th UK.

Some of these people have been doing this for years. There's a blog called the Coleman experience who i expect he has insider info. Seems to back to loads of stars and of course the bbc . There's also  a decent explanation of Jill dando death, she was gonna expose the ring afaik, and where the people who where involved are now.

false,bruce_mcmango,null,null,"I respectfully disagree. Let's imagine what would happen if, say, tomorrow the government would outlaw buy-to-let and ban people from owning more than 1 property, thus eliminating them from influencing the rest of the housing market.

Firstly, there would be the bank-led repossession of millions of properties as former landlords would clearly decline to carry on paying the debt for assets they do not own and are unable to sell on. Landlord properties owned outright that do not sell can't carry on taking rental income - so what happens to the tenants? Do they no longer have a right to stay in a property that isn't theirs? Do they become squatters?

Sure, some renters with incomes and savings sufficient to meet the mortgage lending criteria (bear in mind the recent restrictions passed a few months ago) will be able to negotiate a cheap price and buy their own property. 

But what about the types of people being described in the article? The zero hour contract or the minimum wage income supporting a family of 7? These are people you wouldn't lend ¬£20 to, let alone anything that can come near even approaching the value of the kitchen goods. People in this level of poverty are the type who use Wonga and dreadfully expensive monthly financing to buy something as simple as a fridge.

These people would still be unable to buy their own property. So where do they live if there is no rented accommodation? Where would anybody live if, for example, they were students studying away from home or in a job that requires frequent moving? 

My point is that despite being bogeymen to the simple-minded (because who wants to pay rent?) the rental market provides enormous social value and it is naive to think 1. That everybody *should* own their home and that 2. Landlords are responsible for the symptoms of poverty.

Essentially you can say what you like unless there's a decent reason why you can't.

Countries like germany have banned holocaust denial for decades and yet the ECHR has not struck it down, because it isn't a violation of the convention, simple as that. In America such laws would be struck down in an instant by the supreme court because their free speech rights are a lot tighter.

Ultimately a continent with real historical problems with fascists and other hardline extremists is never going to have balls-to-the-wall American style free speech, it's just not workable. In Europe you have limits on your speech, and that isn't ever going to change.

Spurs are not a top 4 team.  Spurs are a high mid-table team, with high aspirations.  Bill Nich said it best:

&gt;It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.

I am content with aspirations and wanting more than anything to be in the top 4 (and have nothing against aspiring to win the league).  Those aspirations are the Spurs way.  What I can't abide is this knee jerk reaction that comes with every loss or draw, and how 'we don't deserve to be in the top 4 because we drew or lost against XYZ'.  We don't deserve to be in the top 4 because we are a mid-table team, full stop.  When Spurs do get into the top 4, it is not going to be because it was deserved or expected - it will be the attainment of sights set higher than we should expect to be able to fulfill.  It will be achieved by knocking out another side who had every expectation of being within the top 4, which makes it all the sweeter.

Failure to make the top 4 is not a failure for the season or the team.  Failure to make the top 4 can carry with it the echo of glory for a race well run... and in our case, a sporadic running of a race with a combination of epic highs (e.g. Rabona and a hat trick for Harry) - as well as some miserable lows (recent Newcastle loss).

If you are Spurs, then I am happy to share my highs and lows with you as we make that sporadic run season after season.  But don't you dare diminish the echo of glory I feel when Spurs made a good run of it and finish 6th or 7th.  Don't you dare make it feel like a finish in 4th place was 'just meeting expectations'.  Take your top 4 finish expectations off to go root for the scum, or one of the other sides that are top 4 teams.

The OP of this thread already pointed out that those attending would probably not be the 'top quality' fire-fighters and - once again because you keep missing it - *this is at the busiest point of the year*. 

How many are on strike? What are the chances they're going to be too short-staffed to attend every call out? What exactly can we assume will happen (the weekend of firework night) when they're on strike? Being on strike means you don't show up - so why wouldn't I assume it would mean exactly that? 

&gt; Your just a selfish prick that only thinks about your own well being,

I doubt anyone would be any different if and when their house catches fire. You really think people will say 'Oh I understand my home had to burn because inexperienced emergency services couldn't tackle it and all the experienced ones were striking. That's fine.' 

Strike if you must, but why *now* when most needed. You want to talk about being a selfish prick? You're openly putting the needs of the fire service above the needs of the public *at this busy point in the year*. 

Since your approach is assumptions about me followed by a 'fuck you' then you can count on me not getting involved - not if pricks like you are the ones doing the asking. But if someone had thought to say ""We're going to keep our service running because we know how necessary it is at this time of year, *but* here's how the government has been screwing us - please help put the pressure on"" then you'd get very different results. 

As it stands, fuck your entitled cause. I've been choosing my words careful till now but if someone loses their home or is otherwise injured as a result of fire that could've been better fought if you weren't striking over the next few days - it's on your selfish head. The fire service knows what time of year it is and chooses to strike anyway? Fuck anyone who takes part.

If you have to go back to before the First World War to find a problem with the House of Lords I'd say they are doing a pretty good job. 

&gt;There is no accountability. It has become a club of ex politicians and donors. The technocracy of experts is a myth - just look at the tech panel. The elected assembly will have its faults but at least we can get rid of them in elections.

Those are all problems with the Lords, problems that can be fixed. What I asked you was why an elected Senate would be better?

&gt;The technocracy of experts is a myth - just look at the tech panel. 

There are clearly a wide range of skills not covered by the Lords, technology is one area that needs improvement, and that is one reform I would like to see in the Lords. But filling a second house with elected career politicians is one to to ensure that NO experts get to influence our legislation.

There are a wide range of skills present in the lord, including business, science and medical. There needs to be some improvement, and those skills need to better represent the modern age, but what we have is better than the alternative. 

Can I ask you, what purpose would an elected senate serve? Many of the advantage of the lords come from the fact that they are not elected. They do not have to make decisions based on party politics. They are less likely to make decisions purely to appease the public, they are able to look at the long term impact of legislation, not just worry about how it will impact the next election. 

All of these benefits disappear with an elected senate, so why have a second house at all?

----

It looks a bit more complicated than yours, but I've spent the better part of this year testing and trialing things out. I'll explain my process!


*Cleansing*.

Oil Cleansing and finding a gentle pH 5.5 cleanser  (skin is slightly acidic, so it's best to use a cleanser that's around that range) has greatly helped me cut down my oil. I tried baby oil too and it broke me out. I think it's because I didn't fully take it off, and my skin didn't love that. Either way, when I bought a prepackaged oil cleanser with an emulsifier my skin really responded to oil cleansing. It is the easiest and most gentle way to take off makeup. 


*Exfoliating*.

I started with a BHA, then added the Nip+Fab pads that you use, but they weren't strong enough so when /u/xerane kindly offered me the Mizon I jumped at it. My skin really *really* likes glycolic acid. I just found that the combination of the hydroluronic acid in the Nip+Fab pads were overwhelming my skin a little in the moisture department. The retinol I added on a whim and it is really helping my Closed Comedones go away! 

*Moisturising.*

Day time I use a gel mosturiser always. Always. Our oily skin prefers it I don't feel oily afterwards.

The drops of oil in my night time moisturiser help it sink in. Ever since I started I don't wake up with an oily face at all.

-----

**Your next steps!**

Obviously, I'm not saying you should run out and buy everything I use! That would probably overwhelm your skin and may not even work for you. But I would start (and I did start) by taking each step of your routine and trying to tweak it. 

I'd start with removing and adding back any products you're using to see if they are working. If they aren't working, make a note of the ingredients, and then cross check to see if there are any similarities. You might have sensitivities to ingredients. That's how I discovered my skin does not love niacinamide. 

Maybe look into an oil cleanser with an emulsifier. Boots has a few, they even do their own brand that isn't too pricey. Johnsons baby oil now have a [fragrance free version](http://www.boots.com/en/Johnsons-Baby-First-Touch-Oil-200ml_1487558/), so you could try again.

I agree in principle with the idea of the Lords being made politically neutral via some kind of automatic assignment of seats, avoiding party-political members (elected chamber) and members appointed via an opaque appointments process with unclear criteria.

However, such a chamber would have to be a representative cross-section of British society in order to have legitimate ability to speak for the British people. Random selection, like jury service, would be one idea.

But I don't think this is workable in practice. Not only does a Lord have to commit far more time than someone on jury service, the Lords also performs a lot of technical work reviewing legislation and random lottery would, by its very representative function, select many people whose educational background was not up to the task.

Quite simple, though not terribly well explained by the article:

 - A couple with one or two kids who come from a culture where several generations of family often live together move in. 
 - They tell him they are a couple with two kids, he says ""fine"" and lets them the property.
 - A couple of months later, granny moves in with them.
 - Problem: The council has the power to fine the property owner if the property is overcrowded. Reading between the lines, this chap is extremely risk-averse - he won't take that risk. And he doesn't have to, because at any given point in time there's dozens of potential tenants for every vacant property.
 - Upshot: The way the law is written, it actively encourages him to evict people who do this. And - whether it was intentional on the part of the government or not - the people who do so tend to come from cultures where nobody thinks twice about moving the whole extended family into a relatively small house. 

To put it another way: Congratulations, government, you've engineered a system whereby anyone who wants to maintain their native culture of having the entire family all living together can only afford to do so by throwing themselves on the mercy of landlords who don't give a damn about overcrowding legislation. And if they don't care about that legislation, what other legislation do they not care about?

The left-wing press paints this guy as an evil landlord who will do anything to make a bit more money; my guess is that in actual fact his property empire is mortgaged to the hilt and the only way he can run it is by doing everything by the book: insurance against defaulting tenants, evicting tenants who do something that puts him at risk and so on. No insurance company will cover someone who needlessly puts themselves at risk, and I bet the bank loans in question demand insurance as a condition of the loan.",0,1414838206,null,0,false,0,clpvs7p,t3_2kvgeo,t1_clpvs7p,t1_clp33r7,null,1426245093,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

In order to mask the current flaking a primer could definitely help - the silicone based pore filling smoothing types should help to stick flakes down and smooth the area, but they can be drying, so get hold of some samples and patch test and experiment to see if they work for you.

Also when applying foundation avoid buffing brushes and circular motions. This will lift flakes and make them more obvious.

The problem is that it's getting to the stage where more and more people are being priced out of buying as prices increase and where does that stop?

We have a massive problem looming because there is a step increase in the number of people alive born after the war compared to born during the war (for obvious war related reasons).

Pensioners make up 65% of our benefits and cost four times (even more as they get older) as much per capita in healthcare. On average it takes three working age people to pay for these pensioners, plus themselves. 

So we face a choice of either massively increasing our tax per person, cutting benefits (and pensioners always seem to be exempt from these cuts) or somehow increasing our working age population to pay for this ever increasing bill. Or more likely a combination thereof.

Not so long ago I had a dispute with a driver about ""break of journey"" on a single ticket, I was convinced I was allowed to do it because the previous 10 drivers never questioned me. This time the driver got extremely aggressive, his face went purple and he tried to get out of his cab, presumably to physically remove me. I stood in front if his gate and wouldn't allow him to get out, mainly as I felt scared he was going to attack me, he was already running late so then said ""just get on"" with some chagrin and irritation. I figured everyone has a bad day and decided to be diplomatic about the situation to try and make him feel better.
As I disembarked I thanked him for allowing me passage and volunteered to check my rights with First and that I would pay dues if I was wrong, his response was a series of expletives and a warning that he would never let me ride a bus again if he was driving.
Turns out he was right and ""break of journey"" is disallowed by t&amp;c. I never paid the difference because First make a killing out of my buying day passes instead of returns, and he was an a$$hole so I think screw them and him.
I've never seen him once since, I like to think someone else on the bus reported him for being abusive and he got sacked for poor customer service, but honestly he was so fat, unhealthy looking and stressed out I wouldn't be surprised if he had died of a high blood pressure or stress related malady.

That's because they were forced to have their powers limited - the same would be done with an elected  second chamber.

&gt;I would like to see in the Lords. But filling a second house with elected career politicians is one to to ensure that NO experts get to influence our legislation.

You are taking the piss here -  the House of Lords at present is  is pretty much a House of Cronies.

&gt;Many of the advantage of the lords come from the fact that they are not elected. 


&gt;They do not have to make decisions based on party politics. 

A whip system operates in the House of Lords. Also a second chamber will assert independence of a first chamber whether elected or not.

They are less likely to make decisions purely to appease the public, they are able to look at the long term impact of legislation, not just worry about how it will impact the next election.

Examples? The elected House of Commons votes consistently against  capital punishment even though the majority of the country are against it.

&gt;Can I ask you, what purpose would an elected senate serve? 

Accountability - We vote them in, we can get rid of them. There's this concept called democracy you may have heard.

false,B23vital,null,null,"&gt;The public pay - by taxes - for police, fire and medical care. If there's an issue there then fine but if you figure that withdrawing that service during its most needed point in the calendar year is appropriate then fuck you. 

Let me remind you that your the one throwing around assumptions, followed by profanities, if you want a slanging match thats fine. 

&gt;would probably not be the 'top quality' fire-fighters and - once again because you keep missing it - *this is at the busiest point of the year*.

So you have no idea of what quality of service you will receive? Your just making assumptions based on your own personal opinion rather than fact, the firefighters are on strike, yes, but the people responding to fires ARE TRAINED firefighters. They have the exact same training as those on strike and are just as capable as those currently on strike, its a REDUCED service! Something you don't seem to understand. 


&gt;How many are on strike? What are the chances they're going to be too short-staffed to attend every call out? What exactly can we assume will happen (the weekend of firework night) when they're on strike? Being on strike means you don't show up - so why wouldn't I assume it would mean exactly that? 
1:The FBU said it expected about 36,000 firefighters to walk out.
2:""The London brigade said it may not attend rubbish or small grass fires or help anyone stuck in a lift.""
3:Bonfire night is the 5th of November, not this weekend. If people want to use fireworks they are by all means allowed, but its very easy to leave it till the following weekend. 
4: You can assume exactly what you like, but these questions clearly show you haven't even followed the link i provided, or at least done some research. Your basing your whole argument against the fire service without full knowledge of the situation

&gt;I doubt anyone would be any different if and when their house catches fire. You really think people will say 'Oh I understand my home had to burn because inexperienced emergency services couldn't tackle it and all the experienced ones were striking. That's fine.' 

Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said fire and rescue authorities have ""robust"" plans in place for the weekend. 
Your house will not be left to burn, once again stop making assumptions.

&gt;Strike if you must, but why *now* when most needed. You want to talk about being a selfish prick? You're openly putting the needs of the fire service above the needs of the public *at this busy point in the year*. 

Once again, thats the point, you have to cause disruption, simple. Yes i agree its not the best time, but may i remind you they have rules and regulations to follow, if not this weekend, then when? The whole month of November, even into December is dangerous for fires. Fireworks are rife, celebrations are on, and fires happen. If not this weekend, you'd be moaning on any other weekend also. 

&gt;But if someone had thought to say ""We're going to keep our service running because we know how necessary it is at this time of year, *but* here's how the government has been screwing us - please help put the pressure on"" then you'd get very different results. 

Would you? Would you even be aware? If these stories don't make the papers people like you and me aren't made aware, this is the first time people have really been made aware, when they actually go on strike. Are you aware these talks have been on going for 2 MONTHS. Are you also aware that Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have all agreed to new proposals with the FBU. Are you even aware that the westminster government stands ALONE on this one. They are the ONLY government in the United Kingdom to refuse to continue the talks. THEY have brought this strike about, THEY are the ones putting your life, and your home on the line, by refusing to even discuss a new deal. 
"" accused it of ""walking away"" from talks after the new fire minister cancelled a planned meeting.""

&gt;As it stands, fuck your entitled cause. I've been choosing my words careful till now but if someone loses their home or is otherwise injured as a result of fire that could've been better fought if you weren't striking over the next few days - it's on your selfish head. The fire service knows what time of year it is and chooses to strike anyway? Fuck anyone who takes part. 

You mentioned earlier on about me making assumptions. Just so your aware, i don't actually work for the fire service. Im not currently striking, so your the one here clearly making assumptions. I asked questions based on your input and said 'if you are not doing that then fuck you'. Those are not assumptions, those are questions i was expecting answers to. But based on your input throughout the whole of this, i can clearly see you have done no prior research, and are basing your whole argument on the reading of one or two articles. 
Secondly, i will defend our service men and woman to the end of this earth, The fire service, the NHS, The military, all of them. They do a job to protect and serve us, and they do a DAM good job. They do not deserve to have the absolute piss taken out of them, which they are, MP's are having a 1% pay rise in April, and then are expecting A 10% PAY RISE a month later. 

Finally, your whole argument seems to be based on protecting the public, and i appreciate that, i agree with you, the fire service is here to help us when we are in need. But let me ask you this, and this is the only question i really care about you answering. 
To join the fire service you need to be able to pass a fitness test. Do you really want 60 year old firefighters responding to your call and attempting to tackle a fire on your home. Surely you must see how ludicrous it is to ask this of the fire service. The government is already putting our lives at risk by trying to push firefighters to continue working until they are 60. In a job in which fitness and strength means all, having an unfit firefighter unable to pass their fitness test responding to a call is the last thing you want. You go on about inexperienced fire fighters putting us at risk for 4 days, well will you allow the government to continue this trend and put you at risk for the rest of your life?

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; So you have no idea of what quality of service you will receive? Your just making assumptions based on your own personal opinion rather than fact, the firefighters are on strike, yes, but the people responding to fires ARE TRAINED firefighters. They have the exact same training as those on strike and are just as capable as those currently on strike, its a REDUCED service! Something you don't seem to understand. 

Something you don't understand is exactly how vague and un-reassuring that is. 

Reduced service? Will I notice? Presumably I will or there'd be no point in the strikes - so in literal terms how safe is the public? Still as safe despite the reduced service? If so - why do we need any of the firefighters who are striking? 

Or if *not* still as safe - then my surmise is correct that those fire-fighters who are striking will be responsible for every injury and loss of property that could have been prevented. 

Which is it? If we're receiving less than 100% service because of a concious decision to strike - I can't agree with it at this time of year. 

&gt; Once again, thats the point, you have to cause disruption, simple. Yes i agree its not the best time, but may i remind you they have rules and regulations to follow, if not this weekend, then when? The whole month of November, even into December is dangerous for fires. Fireworks are rife, celebrations are on, and fires happen. If not this weekend, you'd be moaning on any other weekend also. 

This weekend and next are the closest to firework night. You shouldn't need to be told what that means - sure there will be celebrations elsewhere but *these are the closest weekends*. It's not rocket science to know that these will be the busiest periods. 

&gt; Would you? Would you even be aware? If these stories don't make the papers people like you and me aren't made aware, this is the first time people have really been made aware, when they actually go on strike. 

Then the problem is with communication of the issues. 

Don't make the general public suffer for it. That's precisely the end effect here. 

&gt; Finally, your whole argument seems to be based on protecting the public, and i appreciate that, i agree with you, the fire service is here to help us when we are in need. But let me ask you this, and this is the only question i really care about you answering. To join the fire service you need to be able to pass a fitness test. Do you really want 60 year old firefighters responding to your call and attempting to tackle a fire on your home. Surely you must see how ludicrous it is to ask this of the fire service.

I'll answer that and I think it makes my stance clear - I absolutely support the plight of the fire-fighters. It's a shitty hand and no I wouldn't want service people unfit for their jobs being forced into it. 

*However* there are plenty of other times outside of these two weekends that a protest could go on. If you asked me without mentioning anything 'when is the busiest time for fire fighters?' I'd tell you these weekends. 

That's why I really don't support this strike. The concept is sound - I support the reasons - but not the execution. Not *this* time of year. 

Edit: Also I will say sorry for my tone earlier. I feel quite passionately about service people refusing to work and inconveniencing everyone else as a result - I'm mindful that if *I* tried that in the private sector I'd be fired in short order. An inconvenience is a shame - but a threat to public safety is unforgivable.

&gt;Examples? The elected House of Commons votes consistently against capital punishment even though the majority of the country are against it.

Just look up Government defeats in the House of Lords. There are hundreds of examples.

[Here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16515414) is an example of the Lords rejecting a welfare cut bill that would have taken benefits from 15,000 young disabled people. 

[Here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20438049) is an example of the Lords preventing the government from using secret courts, which would be totally against the principles of law we have.

[Here](http://www.statelessness.eu/blog/uk-house-lords-defeats-government-deprivation-citizenship-leading-statelessness) is the case of the Lords rejecting the government proposal to remove citizenship from some criminals, effectively leaving them stateless.

That last one was a popular idea at the time. Would an elected house have voted against that? We elect politicians to represent us in Government, if an idea is popular with the people, our elected officials have the duty to at least consider it. You mention capital punishment being popular with voters, and the commons voting constantly against it, but is that democratic? If the people for this country want it, shouldn't it be considered? 

The point of an unelected second house is that they don't have to make decisions based on what the electorate thinks. 

&gt;Accountability - We vote them in, we can get rid of them. There's this concept called democracy you may have heard.

We already have a democratic system. There is no such thing as a true democracy. We elect MPs to represent us, and they have the power in the end. Lords can only delay bills and send them back for consideration, but they cannot stop them passing indefinitely. 

Adding a second elected house does not make the process work better, and in the end does not make the process any more democratic either.

 I would argue that having a house of Lords full of people appointed by democratically elected officials is more democratic than having a house full of people who were only elected by less than 10% of the electorate in some cases, if the police and crime commissioner elections are anything to go by.

There is no way for them to tell what TV programme you are watching based on information from a smart electricity meter.

If you are aware of how this is supposed to happen, please share this information with us, otherwise stop with your appealing to authority nonsense.

I understand how the technology works; I am able to speak on this issue. I am not simply parroting what someone else has said and taking it as gospel, unlike yourself. You clearly don't understand the technology and would rather be safe than sorry. Sure, that makes sense. But it prevents the ignorant from moving forward with the rest of us.

I didn't say anything about peering through the curtains, I said it is easier to see if the lights are on. This can be done usually without ""peering"".

The only issue I would say is legitimate is perhaps the lack of encryption where it was supposed to be present. I would only consider this to be an issue during transport on the backbone network, not during local wireless transmission, though. Unfortunately what these people do, and people like you accept, is putting nonsense like being able to tell what you're watching into the mix as well.

So, you're happy to believe this website, which is written by people who are just people (techy people, sure, maybe). But you're not happy to believe me, I am just a techy person writing something online too.

Why is that? If you're for smart meters, why would you choose to believe that they can let people into your life to the extent that they can tell what's on your TV? Use your brain, of course they can't. If you don't believe this yourself (I'm assuming you don't, if you consider yourself someone that understands the technology, as you imply) why are you using it as a source? It clearly can't be trusted.

EDIT: The tech phobia statement was directed to the people on that website for writing the nonsense, and at you for believing it. And at others for believing it. Ignorance is no excuse for scaremongering.

If you believe you are qualified enough to be either pro or anti smart meters, you would do well to actually understand the facts and technology involved. Until then you are in no position to take a stance either way, frankly.

You're clutching at straws here again, the PCC elections have a low turnout because people don't see the point in them, an elected senate would actually have power and a point, so the turnout would probably be at least as high and it would certainly be more democratic that letting the winning party in the House of Commons pick who gets to be a lord, especially since you can win a majority in the House of Commons with just 35% of the vote.",0,1414845650,null,0,false,0,clpwyxn,t3_2kxenx,t1_clpwyxn,t1_clpws6n,null,1426244540,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I take your point about FI and the presence of petrol in the cylinder, but at this point you've covered the basic yes/no questions, so we're looking for ""is this working well enough"" questions. So given that there is petrol, the questions are whether there's the right quantity, and whether there's any water in the petrol.

One thing you didn't mention was air. It's unlikely to be the problem, but can you check the air filter is not clogged? This is most likely with an aftermarket filter such as a K&amp;N in the rain.

How much power were you using when it stopped? Just pottering; half power; or giving it beans? Was there any stumbling of the engine before it stopped?

Unless you're absolutely sure the tank is full, it may be a good idea to top it up.

If your Dad is giving you a lift back to the bike, try jump starting it from the car battery to make sure it's not a low battery problem. Turn the car off. Connect the red lead between the car battery's + terminal  and your battery's + terminal. Then the black lead from the car battery's - terminal to your battery's - terminal (some people recommend going from bare metal on the car's chassis away from the battery to similar bare metal on the bike to avoid the risk of a hydrogen explosion, but I think that's being paranoid on a bike and it gives a poorer connection).

false,strum,null,null," I'd like to see some thought given to the terms of reference for an Upper Chamber; simply re-creating the current responsibilities would be a missed opportunity.

1. The HoL is used as a revising chamber - basically, fixing the Commons' mistakes. I believe this leads to even more sloppiness in the HoC. I'd like the UC to have 'prevising' powers - the ability to examine proposed ligislation, before the HoC bearpit gets to work on it. The UC would work to clarify measures, point out potential pitafalls, unientended consequences and alternative ways of achieving the same ends. They could also work to simplify the language, so that lay people could understand the laws they were supposed to obey. HoC could still amend and re-write, as at present - but the UC could then point out how far they had strayed from their stated intentions.
 
1. The UC could look also look at broader issues, over longer time periods. They would act as a sort of Royal Commission on Everything, taklng expert evidence and commissioning surveys - to build a broad understanding of the kind of country we are, and kind we want to be. They might suggest measures to achieve this, but that would still be the responsibility of HMG &amp; HoC.

1. One special case for consideration would be a semi-permanent constitutional commission, reviewing the way in which our instututions respond to the public will and the public interest (not always the same thing).

&gt;Whereas clandestinely logging into an individual's CPE through that BTAgent backdoor can obviously be done without any official oversight, and from anywhere in the world.


That statement makes no sense, it's still RIPA to pull logs from a remote CPE device, the same as it's for pulling from within the telco network.

The blog posts he's made don't show anything other than some remote managment for BT.

Which of course can be exploited by intelligence agencies.

&gt;e.g. with remote access via a CPE backdoor, the local ethernet port on the CPE can be put into ""promiscuous mode"" and all ethernet frames on the local network snagged. Allowing, for example, the snooping of traffic to a networked local printer in an office.  Surveillance couldn't easily be done without access to a device on the local ethernet. Hence the usefulness of a CPE backdoor.

Pretty sure I do.

&gt;Our representatives are supposed to consider what's best for the country rather than just voting for what's popular. 

They consider what is best for the country, AND the views of the people who elected them. That's the ""representative"" part of ""representative democracy"".

&gt;The point about capital punishment is that it is popular but it doesn't get enacted because our representatives don't think it would work out well.

I agree, I also think that it does not have as much support amongst the public as people here seem to think. Less than 50% support it, and that figure is falling year on year, so I think its a bad example of something popular with the public but opposed by the government. 

There aren't many examples of such things, because if an idea is popular with the voting public, the government will find a way to introduce it. Just look at how all the major parties have hardened their positions on immigration and Europe, after seeing public opinion change so strongly over the last couple of years. Politicians change their position based on public opinion. That is a fact.   

&gt;If our elected representatives were just mindless automatons who enacted the public's will unthinkingly then you would have a point. But they aren't, and since that's what your argument is based on, you don't have a point. 

I'm not sure what your point is now. As I have said, politicians take public opinion into consideration massively, and MPs voting records reflect that. Why would you think otherwise?   

&gt;the PCC elections have a low turnout because people don't see the point in them, 

People don't see the point in voting for anyone. The only reason they vote in general elections is because they think the person they vote for might actually be able to affect their lives, and make a difference to local issues. Even then voter turnout is incredibly poor. 

There is absolutely no reason to think that turnout would be any higher than police commissioners, and every reason to think it would actually be lower, as more and more people are becoming disillusioned with voting in general.   

&gt;it would certainly be more democratic that letting the winning party in the House of Commons pick who gets to be a lord

The House of Lords Appointments Commission vets ALL nominees before allowing them to become a member of the Lord. It's an independent body set up to prevent just what you described from happening.

Less than 50% support it, and that figure is falling year on year, so I think its a bad example of something popular with the public but opposed by the government.

Do you have a source for that? Back when the Lib Dems why trying to push through house of lords reform [53% wanted a fully elected house of lords, and only 26% disagreed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/59-of-voters-back-lords-reform-bid-7932535.html). That's a huge margin of support.

&gt; There aren't many examples of such things, because if an idea is popular with the voting public, the government will find a way to introduce it. Just look at how all the major parties have hardened their positions on immigration and Europe, after seeing public opinion change so strongly over the last couple of years. Politicians change their position based on public opinion. That is a fact.

Do you think it would be better if public opinion were ignored then? Would you rather live under a dictatorship? 

&gt; The House of Lords Appointments Commission vets ALL nominees before allowing them to become a member of the Lord. It's an independent body set up to prevent just what you described from happening. They also are responsible for selecting the huge number of cross bench no-party affiliated Lords.

And yet we still had the cash for peerages scandal, we still have many ex House of Commons politicians ending up in the house of lords, and still the majority of lords are affiliated to a political party.

&gt; There is absolutely no reason to think that turnout would be any higher than police commissioners, and every reason to think it would actually be lower, as more and more people are becoming disillusioned with voting in general.

Well there is. PCCs don't have much power, and most people didn't want them to be elected. The Lords do have power and most people do want them to be elected. The fact that our representatives have served us poorly isn't a reason to abandon democracy.

false,mishagale,null,null,"Parties like UKIP, and even the mainstream Conservative party, promulgate a lot of myths about immigration, which leads to a debate about largely imaginary ""problems."" For example:

* ""Immigrants are taking jobs from British workers!"" - this is one of the most common, and it's based on the Lump Of Labour fallacy. The truth is that if you add people to a population, they will indeed need employment. But they will also consume goods and services, meaning that more jobs must be created to provide for these new people. There are a number of industries which actually depend on immigrant labour, either because we don't have enough people with the relevant skills (e.g. the health sector) or because British-born people are simply unwilling to take certain jobs.
* ""Britain is full!"" - If there were no immigration into this country, the population would be reducing (this is true of most developed nations, birthrate tends to correlate negatively with wealth.) There is a high population-density in London and the South-East, which might be partly a result of immigration, but is also a result of UK-born people moving towards the capital from the regions.
* ""They come here to claim benefits!"" - The majority of immigrants are actually in work. So called ""economic migrants"" come to countries like the UK because there are more opportunities and wages are higher, not because of our benefits system (note that often the same people claim that immigrants are workshy scroungers AND that they are taking our jobs.) Of course, people in low-paid jobs often still need to claim benefits to support their families, which is a problem which affects both native British people and immigrants. The one group who do definitely claim benefits (asylum seekers) do so because they are forbidden from earning a living. It shouldn't need to be pointed out that *illegal* immigrants don't get any benefits, since they are here illegally, and thus need to be ""off-the-grid.""
* ""Immigrants are a drain on our public services!"" - This might be true in the short-term. However, it is also a variant on the lump-of-labour fallacy. If someone comes to this country and e.g. gets treatment on the NHS, that is a cost. However, they should also be working, paying taxes, and contributing to the economy, which should result in more investment in public services to support the growing population. This one is trickier economically, since recent migrants are likely to be low-earners and thus may cost the state more than they contribute. A society with better wealth-equality and social mobility would be more able to accommodate poor immigrants, since they wouldn't necessarily stay poor.

Right-wing parties often say things like ""you can't have a reasonable discussion about the problems of immigration in this country without the Left accusing you of racism."" However, when apparently educated and intelligent people trot out these discredited myths, it's hard to see it as anything other than veiled racism.

There are certainly some valid concerns about immigration, especially if there is a very large amount of it over a short time or in a specific area. Rapidly changing the demographics of a population can lead to some unpredictable results, and a sudden influx of people can lead to short-term problems with the provision of housing and public services, though these are certainly solvable in the long-term. 

Some immigrants are probably going to be people we'd rather keep out, such as members of criminal gangs or even terrorists, and it makes sense that we should try and screen them out (though it would be nice if we could do so without resorting to racial profiling.) People-trafficking, especially for sex-work is a serious issue too, both from an economic and from a human-rights perspective, but this rarely involves legal immigration.",0,1414848199,null,0,false,0,clpxioh,t3_2kyu3h,t1_clpxioh,t3_2kyu3h,null,1426244284,68,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,68

It would, wouldn't it? Alas. Would be nice if you could admit you don't understand the reality of what you saw in the POC, really. They *did not* demonstrate that you can tell the channel someone is watching.

The proof of concept you seem to hinge your whole point on is not actually a proof of concept of the claim you are making. Allow me to explain - it's really going to take too long to explain fully so this will be fairly abstract.

1. They are not using a smart meter in their POC. Yes, I know they *say afterwards* that it works with a 2 second interval, but they make no mention of the resolution, various TV types, having other appliances on, etc.
2. Their POC is based mainly on backlight power fluctuations, which is not uniform through all types, makes, and models of TV, as they do mention in their video.
3. Their POC relies on pre-analysing and matching data from a known video source and from a known TV, so is useless in practical applications.
4. They are deliberately using a high power TV, presumably a plasma, in order to give the most fluctuation. 
5. They have used movies for their POC that have very obvious light/dark scenes. This helps for the POC but if you are just watching daytime TV for instance it will not show on the data anywhere near as obviously.

It's a cool little demo for a hacking conference, but all it demonstrates is that TVs overall power consumption changes a small amount depending on what is displayed on screen, which we knew already. I does not demonstrate that you can know, under normal circumstances, what someone is watching on TV.

It does demonstrate that under perfect conditions, knowing the movie beforehand, and having high resolution data, allows you to match the pre-analysed data and go ""aha!"", so long as you have a very power-hungry TV. But you can't look at the data from a real house and go ""these people were watching *This Morning*"". So it's not a POC, it's not an 'attack' - it's nothing. And therefore not a privacy concern.

I think the important thing is that they are a voice and it's better that that voice should be an alternative to the government.

BT use this for managing their modems. If a new firmware needs to be sent out to customers, BT simply put it on their auto configuration server, and the modem will find it and download it.

The new BT home hub with integrated VDSL modem also uses this for hub firmware control, line profile control, IP address management, etc. This way when BT change an account setting, or there is a line speed change, they can send a reconfigure/reboot request to the hub so that the changes can take effect immediately.

However, the capability of the system (called TR069) goes far beyond this. It allows ISPs to auto-configure non-modem devices, e.g. set-top boxes for IPTV (so that the box can automatically configure proxies/CDNs/etc. for that specific broadband line and usernames/passwords for the customer account).

Some people have raised some concerns about this type of system, because in order to be able to configure non-gateway devices, it has to have open ports on the router, to enable the ISP's servers to ping the individual devices and push configuration/control messages to them.",0,1414848552,null,0,false,0,clpxlud,t3_2kyvlw,t1_clpxlud,t1_clpxaha,null,1426244243,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I was talking about support for capital punishment.

And while the polls might suggest support for an elected Lords, I suspect that similarly to the AV vote, it's a case of the public not really understanding what they are being asked. Not many people are fully aware of what the Lords is or why it is the way it is. I think if there was proper public discussion on the issue the majority would recognize it as a good thing. 

&gt;Do you think it would be better if public opinion were ignored then? Would you rather live under a dictatorship? 

No not at all. That is not what I was trying to say. I think that it is a very god thing that we have representative democracy. I think the the role of MPs is very important and the system despite its flaws works well. MPs have a strong democratic mandate to the people. I believe MPs do listen to the public, and that is a very good thing.

I also believe that is is very useful to have a second house that does not have that same mandate to the people. That can make decisions without having to worry about populism or re-elections. Obviously that house should have less power than the elected one, and it does.

I believe that this system leads to much stronger and better legislation being passed. 

&gt;And yet we still had the cash for peerages scandal, we still have many ex House of Commons politicians ending up in the house of lords, and still the majority of lords are affiliated to a political party.

The cash for peerages scandal was the fault of ELECTED MPs, not Lords, so is an example perhaps of why we should not put all our trust in elected officials. Also, the  House of Lords Appointments Commission was instrumental in bringing an end to the practice, so you could argue that the system worked very well. 

Many ex commons politician after many years of service in the commons can be a huge asset to the Lords. What is wrong with using someone with a lot of experience in this way?

I do agree that less lords should be party affiliated, but do you really think that will be the case in the Senate? There will be even more party affiliates, and almost no experts. ",0,1414849930,null,0,false,0,clpxysr,t3_2kxenx,t1_clpxysr,t1_clpxhs4,null,1426244075,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It doesn't really help them though. They will stil be out of pocket. If a rich person kicks the fuck out of a 200k lambo, they will be out of pocket 200k. They may well prefer the 6 months in prison the chav would get to losing that amount of money. I suspect the lambo owner would rather have their lambo back though. 

&gt;Which is why the cautions are so used- but oh wait! This policy gets rid of them.

Implying the police don't just give out cautions for an easy life to stoke their crime stats for things where the magistrates are just going to either not convict or give 5 minutes community service. 

&gt;No. The onus is on everyone not to damage stuff that isn't theirs, whether they think they can pay for it or not. It's pretty damn basic, you ask anyone ""do you mind if I break this as long as at some point in the future if you manage to prove I broke if I'll pay for it to be fixed"" the answer will be ""Yes, I mind and that's a completely stupid system"".

If you break something by accident in a shop it's considered that you've bought it, why not in the wider world? 

It's pretty clear you just have a chip on your shoulder against evil mean rich people. You are aware that they already just pay their way out of trouble and this is nothing new right?

false,ReubenTuesday,cnty-scotland,Scottish-ish,"&gt; If the roof collapses, boiler explodes or there's creeping damp... Not your problem

Unless your landlord is lazy/cheap/uncaring. I know people who've lived in flats with broken windows that had to be covered up with cardboard for months, broken boilers leaving them with no hot water for weeks on end, broken appliances meaning there's no way to cook, or store food, or wash clothes. Many of these situations had to be solved by going through the local council and threatening the landlord with legal action which can be a time consuming/stressful process.

&gt;Lose your job or need to cut back - a renter can downsize almost instantly and save money.

Depending on where you live, renting privately when unemployed or on low income can be nearly impossible. Landlord/agencies want references from work, credit checks etc... If looking at flat sharing, the existing tenants in the property are going to choose the prospective flatmate in full time employment over the one relying on HB or a zero hour contract to pay the rent. 

Getting into social housing comes with it's own host of issues. Huge wait lists that give priority to vulnerable applicants and those with small children. If you're a single person with no mental/physical health issues and fairly steady employment, you could wait years for a suitable property. And even then it's a crap shoot as to whether you get a decent place or a place in a poorly maintained building in a dodgy housing estate.

I'm not saying renting is all doom and gloom, I've lived in some great flats over the years, and had some wonderful landlords. But I've also dealt with a fair few who couldn't give a fuck about anything other than getting their rent cheque every month and can certainly see why the prospect of home ownership, even with all the possible issues it presents, is so alluring to many people.",0,1414850022,null,0,false,0,clpxzql,t3_2kvgeo,t1_clpxzql,t1_clpq8iw,null,1426244063,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In the house they discuss in more detail the governments policies then they can in the house of commons.

The bosses advertised in Poland, brought them over by the bus load, put them up in properties they owned and took the rent/bills directly out of their wages. 3/4 of them didn't know what they were doing and were taught the job on-site by their comrades. Many couldn't speak, read or write English but still somehow passed their Health &amp; Safety inductions, which was a complete joke, I watched as the course leader basically just filled them in for them, and they passed.

They were supposedly self-employed but were paid at a day rate of about ¬£40 a day to avoid the minimum wage rate.  The British workers couldn't compete with that because of the cost of living. We weren't living 8+ to a house. Eventually, when they had enough of them here to cover all the contracts, we weren't given any-more work and all ended up down the dole office. That was also full of immigrants looking for work. I was out of work for year. I have a family. It was not a good time.

So yes, mass, open-door, unskilled immigration is a problem for the people of this country. The only reason some people don't care about it is because it hasn't effected them in a negative way yet, or they just don't give a shit about the plight of their fellow countrymen and prefer to call them racists whilst having no understanding of the issue.

Us citizens now have the absolute worst nanny state security apparatus in the western world. Luckily there are some technological solutions to can help again political apathy.

So what can we do? Here are some of my personal suggestions:

**Apathy level: High - I don't care**

If you really don't care about government intrusion into your privacy there are some very minimal things you can still do.

*  Make sure your computer is up to date
*  Consider using full-disk encryption. All modern operating systems have this built in although Microsoft's implementation cannot be trusted it is probably better than nothing if your PC gets stolen.
*  Are you using a firewall? You should be.
*  Start using security related browser plugins such as [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/)/[Disconnect](https://disconnect.me) and [Adblock](https://getadblock.com). Also make sure your browsers accept as few third-party cookies as possible.
*  Make sure your privacy settings on popular social network sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) are as strict as they can get.
*  Stop giving away your information. Don't use Nectar cards, start using cash, don't post your location on Facebook, etc. Make it hard for someone to track you.

**Apathy level: Medium - I'm willing to do some things**

*  Use something trusted for full-disk encryption. Truecrypt has been abandoned under usual circumstances but the audit has revealed no security flaws yet. [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) if you can.
*  Migrate away from large US services. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Skype, etc. are all untrustworthy. Remember GCHQ can see anything the Yanks can.
*  Alternative search engines are a good idea, Duckduckgo, startpage and Ixquick are all decent options.
*  Replace compromised BT hardware with your own, ideally it should support open-source software such as DD-WRT and OpenWRT.
*  Consider using non-US email services. No Gmail.

**Apathy level: Low - I'm willing to do a lot**

If you're already at this stage you probably don't need me telling you what to do.

*  Use only open-source software when possible. You absolutely should be running Linux, FreeBSD or similar.
*  Anonymise all of your traffic. Consider a VPN if you want decent performance and Tor if you want something free.
*  No social networking sites.
*  Use [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org) to start encrypting your emails. Use anonymous email services.

**Apathy level: Whistleblower**

*  Encrypt everything.
*  Use TAILS and save nothing.
*  Go off the grid.
*  Live in the woods.

This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide on how to protect yourself, just a starting point. Just remember that properly implemented crypto works.

false,[deleted],null,null,"From /u/Tatermen's comment on /r/technology 

&gt;I've read this guys 'technical' details that he published on cryptome.org last year. He gets a massive amount of things just plain wrong. Also, cryptome.org will anonymously publish pretty much any sort government /r/conspiracy[1] fuel with little review.

&gt;Let's start with his ""sooper-sekret DOD network"". It's actually just a management network - it's used to diagnose faults, push out firmware updates etc etc. It's impossible to run any sort of large network without having a dedicated management system. If you break into one of these routers and look at the configuration of the '301' network, it is literally named TR069_INTERNET - TR069 being a broadband CPE management protocol.

&gt;Also, at the start of his document the ""BTAgent"" process is how the attacker gets in and changes things and is the core of the whole setup. At the end of the document, he claims it's just misdirection 161 is used for SNMP [Simple Network Management Protocol] and so fits perfectly with it being used for management). He even admits that the only function he can find in it is to manage the firmware updating.

&gt;He literally has no evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever.

&gt;A few other select idiocies.

&gt;Other tools and services are permanently enabled inside the modem, which greatly aid the attacker , such as Zebra &amp; Ripd routing daemons, iptables firewall, SSH remote shell server, along with a dhcp client.

&gt;Most routers these days are based on an embedded version of Linux. Pretty much everything he mentions here is part of all linux-based routers. Even OpenWRT, which in his eyes is somehow safe and immune, contains these tools.

&gt;The attacker simply creates a static route or more easily publishes a Routing Information Protocol Request (RIP) request ... and your traffic for that network will then be routed to the attackers network undetectable by you

&gt;This is laughably dumb. RIP is a routing protocol intended for very, very small networks. It would not be used across a national network. It's also grossly unnecessary - if you have direct access to modify the routers configuration, why bother with a routing protocol for such a simple modification? On top of that, this would be easily detected by the victim - a simple traceroute would show a sudden change in IP addresses once activated.

&gt;The attacker can secretly route your traffic to the U.S. without your permission, consent or knowledge

&gt;Except, you know, your packets have to cross the atlantic ocean and your latency for local servers reaching 200ms+. Yeah, you totally couldn't tell.

&gt;Red Warning Sticker on the back ‚Äì ‚ÄúDon't cover Air Holes‚Äù, wise but scary

&gt;Yes, clear evidence that this device is stealing your thoughts data. It couldn't possibly be that the thing keeps really hot and if you cover the ventilation it'll overheat and stop working.

&gt;In summary, the guy claims to be an embedded firmware designer - and yet clearly knows nothing about network design or technology and very little about router firmware. He's a conspiracytard/paranoid-schizophrenic (police visiting and charging him with harassment over blog posts about NHS corruption is just a cover for MI6 etc) that's learned a little bit about open-source router firmwares, and pretty much made up everything off the back of a handful of Snowden documents and his own delusions. Any ISP could perform a MITM attack without needing to put a special box in your house - it's trivial to configure, and can be done entirely at the datacentre... no need to put wierd boxes in your house.

false,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Dear me, there's some paranoid rantings on there.

Let's look at this one step at a time:

 - Fact: It is commonplace for ISPs to provide routers.
 - Fact: Every one of these routers is a small computer with a public IP address. 
 - Fact: From time to time, issues will arise. If it's a single model that has been sold by someone like Belkin or Netgear, the customer (assuming they bother to check - or even know that they should) can usually upgrade it or configure it to deal with these issues. If it's one of many thousands of identical routers that have been shipped to all the customers, the ISP is potentially in trouble.
 - Logical solution: A mechanism whereby every ISP-provided router can be centrally managed. You can't have your tech support team manually log into every customer's router in the middle of the night and upgrade the firmware manually; it'd be a disaster.

Lo and behold, such a solution exists. In fact, it's such a big problem that the solution itself has been standardised into something called TR-069 and ISPs can buy a commercial TR-069 server to do the management of all these routers. How does it work? Well, in very broad terms, as soon as the router is switched on it tries to contact a pre-configured TR-069 server, whereupon it'll be set up with a number of configuration parameters. These can later be updated by the ISP - they can even push out a new firmware version if necessary.

What term does the IT industry use to describe an application that sits on something to allow centralised management?

I get that we are missing our main two strikers, but our team philosophy of pass and move, counter attacking football should really be independent of two players. Fluidity should still be there, if not the end product. If it was the case of a handful of players not performing, if would be obvious enough that their underperformance was costing us, and a simple change of personnel would allow the team to perform optimally again, but it's not. All players are not performing, and that just *can't* be a coincidence. Brendan, this is on you. *Your* players aren't performing because of *your* system. I refuse to put the responsibility of this team on anybody else. 

Rodgers has no excuses now; he's had the money to build his own team and, ten games into the season, not only are we still not clicking, but his signings have done so little to demonstrate why we would buy them in the first place. (Segway: I really, really, think Lovren is an absolute waste of space. Why did we buy Sakho the year before and sell Agger just for him?)

   It was July, 1976, the summer of a long heat spell. Although our teacher was a stinky, alchoholic, short-tempered, pathetic little man who we called ""Hitler,"" we had a whipround and coughed up the ¬£3.99 and I had it in my bag ready to give him during the last class of the school year.   

He was particularly tetchy from the start of the lesson. The classroom was unbearably hot even though we had the windows open and had been allowed to loosen our ties and remove our jackets. It didn't take long for Hitler to fly off the handle and give the whole class after-school detention: It was due to be a half-day, so instead of getting out at lunchtime, we would be there until, at least, five o'clock.   

The kids were furious, and after the class ended and detention had started, they demanded that I return the lighter and give them their money back.   

It dawned on me that there was a better way to get back at him and told them to wait. A couple of hours later he told us that we could leave, and with a dead-silent room, I stood up and thanked him for being our Form Master for the year and told him that we had clubbed together and got him a present. With him glaring at me, I walked up to his desk, put the Argos lighter on his desk, turned and walked away.   

As we filed out of the classroom, we looked back and saw Hitler sitting there with his head on his chest, sobbing.

We will come good again and hopefully make some decent signings in January.

Targets; Bertrand, Williams, Dempsey, Siggurdson?

Transfer committee purchases; Sakho, coutinho, Sturridge, Alberto, Aspas, Can, Markovic, Moreno, Manquillo

Targets; Mchkytaryan, Costa, Remy, Willian, 

It's obvious enough which are which. 

Rodgers will not buy a defensive mid of any type, only Gerrard and Lucas as options despite lack of legs/ ability to play with a partner. We replaced the most dangerous out and out forward in the world and supplemented a world class but very injury prone striker with Lambert (always a risk he was past it) and Balotelli (one of the least efficient though athletically/technically gifted top strikers around)

His biggest flaw in the market is an obsession with players with premier league experience, however brief. Rodgers wrangled most transfer power away from the committee with his new contract and it has been a shambles.

Lovren was offered to everyone last summer for 8.5 because he was poor at Lyon and the fans hated him, commitee declined. One decent year playing behind the best DM pivot in the league (Schneiderlin and Wanyama) and we throw 20 mill at them. Lallana had one, one very good year (before that lower leagues and a poor first year in the prem) Lambert was always supposed to be last option and he's proved it. Despite every year quality talent from abroad showing that prem experience means little usually ( Southampton/Koeman proving that yet again!) 

Tactically Rodgers has failed to organise a defense with bajillions of euros pumped into it and two and a half years of training, he refuses to surround Balotelli with partners/runners and persists with a midfield base of Gerrard, just Gerrard.

Rodgers transfers; Allen, Borini, Lovren, Lallana, Lambert, Balotelli?
Targets; Bertrand, Williams, Dempsey, Siggurdson?

Transfer committee purchases; Sakho, coutinho, Sturridge, Alberto, Aspas, Can, Markovic, Moreno, Manquillo

Targets; Mchkytaryan, Costa, Remy, Willian, 

It's obvious enough which are which. 

Rodgers will not buy a defensive mid of any type, only Gerrard and Lucas as options despite lack of legs/ ability to play with a partner. We replaced the most dangerous out and out forward in the world and supplemented a world class but very injury prone striker with Lambert (always a risk he was past it) and Balotelli (one of the least efficient though athletically/technically gifted top strikers around)

His biggest flaw in the market is an obsession with players with premier league experience, however brief. Rodgers wrangled most transfer power away from the committee with his new contract and it has been a shambles.

Lovren was offered to everyone last summer for 8.5 because he was poor at Lyon and the fans hated him, commitee declined. One decent year playing behind the best DM pivot in the league (Schneiderlin and Wanyama) and we throw 20 mill at them. Lallana had one, one very good year (before that lower leagues and a poor first year in the prem) Lambert was always supposed to be last option and he's proved it. Despite every year quality talent from abroad showing that prem experience means little usually ( Southampton/Koeman proving that yet again!) 

Tactically Rodgers has failed to organise a defense with bajillions of euros pumped into it and two and a half years of training, he refuses to surround Balotelli with partners/runners and persists with a midfield base of Gerrard, just Gerrard. 

I truly believe that Rodgers is one of the best coaches/man motivators in the world and he's still learning tactically but he should not be allowed anywhere near transfers like in most top European clubs. His refusal to work with a director/hire coaches that fill the gaps he leaves is proving very very costly.",0,1414853952,null,0,false,0,clpz7wv,t3_2kz8fe,t1_clpz7wv,t3_2kz8fe,null,1426243490,30,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,30

Of course the ultimate goal is for the bank to use them to make money off you (once you have a current account, you're unlikely to change it, and are more likely to use the same bank for other financial services e.g. mortgage, car loan). However, you don't have to do any of this, and by managing your money carefully you get get far more out of the account than you give back. Benefits vary between banks, but ones I've seen are:

Perks. Free 4-year railcard, for example. Worth ¬£120. Some banks will give you cash bonuses for opening / moving an account. 

Interest free overdraft. If you use the overdraft sensibly it will allow you lots of flexibility, and won't cost you a thing. Whilst I was a student I'd not infrequently run into this towards the end of the year after the loan had run out, and whilst awaiting summer jobs, and it meant I could still go out, go on holidays etc, despite not having the cash available right then. Obviously there's potential to get into trouble with this, but given you're on here asking the question, you're probably fairly sensible.

The interest free overdrafts usually continue long after graduation. I left university well over a year ago, and still have a ¬£2k interest free overdraft. Am I using it? No, but if I have to spunk ¬£900 on an exam one month then I can not worry about where the money is coming from, and pay it back for free over the next month or two.

But their demands should not be heeded. They represent the past; the modern Tories should be interested in the future.""

But the truth is quite the opposite. The Tories are completely focussed on UKIP voters, to the exclusion of all else. Whenever UKIP gets a blip in the polls, or wins a by-election, you can guarantee that Cameron will be on the news the next day, promising to send home the migrants, give the EU the finger, turn back the tides... whatever he thinks UKIP supporters want to hear.

I could perfectly well imagine myself voting for moderate Conservatives such as Ken Clarke, but this small-minded, xenophobic, little-Englandism turns my stomach. There's no way Cameron will get my vote while he's frothing at the mouth, trying to out-Farage Farage.

Every time Cameron tries to ape UKIP's ludicrous policies, he simply validates them in the minds of the waverers. The Tories seem hell-bent on becoming UKIP-lite. Well if that's all they are, why not vote for the real thing, eh?

thanks for such a thoughtful response.

The ideas in my suggestion all have a point to them.

Election by thirds means there is a staggered changeover of members so no revolutionary changes of party affiliation, leading to a more stable and considered chamber

the age and income based constituencies are to  try and get representation on issues rather than place. There are things which affect ""the poor"", ""the young"" or ""the elderly"" much more than they affect ""the north"" or ""the south"". Imagine someone elected for  their stance on care homes and pensions, or  on student fees.

and the extra third is an attempt to get actual expertise  into the chamber. Lots of comments here asking for experts to be appointed, precious few suggesting how to choose them.

I will concede that longer terms (say 15yrs) may help foster independence.

I would also argue for FPTP to be used for the revising chamber precisely *because* it gives large majorities which are hard to shift.

the effect in an ""by thirds"" chamber would be to  have a body which was slow to change and would take the long view - just what you want a revising chamber to be

I would favour a PR system (STV for preference) for the primary chamber to reflect the mood of the country in choosing a Govt.

other small changes to the system such as ministers only being drawn from the commons and the legislation only being introduced there would also help.

&gt;It's not broken! Why 'fix' it?

yes it is. current agreements after the last Lords reform got rid of (most) of the hereditaries are for the parties to appoint Lords so the whole upper house reflects the vote of the last election; but as appointment is for life the number of Lords is ballooning out of control

Following the [trench warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare) which took place in the poppy fields of [Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders), during the [1st World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_World_War), red poppies have become a symbol of [remembrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day) of soldiers who have died during wartime.

The bulky old TV is glowing, muted in the corner with the VCR the size of several stacked paving stones sitting patiently below it, no doubt primed to record Star Wars or Raiders of The Lost Ark - pre set with times carefully programmed from the Radio Times. 

What's truly startling is that her grandparents and mother are casually smoking and drinking in the front room, with no regard for the children (whom they clearly adore). The kids don't seem bothered and the scene looks otherwise so wholesome it could have been lifted from a family sitcom. 

Her grandfather is gone now, but the grandmother soldiers on. Previously I'd only known him through the staged family portraits that sit on the mantle-piece.

I used to work at an energy utilities company so I might be a bit biased, but there are basically only advantages to smart meters.

* Your usage gets reported automatically, no more having to supply meter readings or have someone come into your house to take readings
* No more estimated readings for you which means you pay for exactly how much you use
* That also means you don't have to provide final readings and negotiate a credit/final bill when you change supplier
* Ensures that energy suppliers can more accurately track usage based on area, time, weather etc. The advantage to that is theoretically less power disruption by being able to plan energy delivery in advance
* The units themselves are more advanced, they will show you stats like your current usage on LCD displays
* If there's a problem with the meter, manufacturers can push out firmware updates as required

Let me address some disadvantages that I hear about smart meters:

* ""My supplier can disconnect me remotely!"" Yes they can, but a supplier isn't allowed to just shut off your energy as the first step. People may be on some type of life support. There are Ofgem regulated steps that need to be taken before they can shut it off. On top of that, just pay your bills.
* ""Suppliers can limit how much energy I use!"" Theoretically yes, but no supplier has committed to doing this. Furthermore, they have to get permission from Ofgem to do this for the same reasons as cutting off your supply.
* ""But my privacy!"" Do you realize your energy provider already has a wealth of information about you? On the topic of man-in-the-middle attacks, the information between your meter and the supplier needs to be encrypted. I expect this will come in time. Until then, why would I want to MITM your energy readings?
* ""The security of the units might not be up to grade and someone might remotely shut off my power"" This has never happened, and seems very unlikely. We shouldn't refuse to innovate because of the small risk that something might go wrong. If something does go wrong, it's probably not going to happen to you and it will be fixed.

My job was a Software Engineer and it's a fucking effort dealing with meter readings and calculating usage summaries from meter readings. You'd think it's just:

    ((end reading - start reading) * unit rate)

But you have to factor in meter exchanges, multiple meters on the premises, meters rolling around from 99999 to 0, different unit rates etc.

This turned into a pretty big wall of text but tldr: if you get offered a smart meter TAKE IT. It makes everyone's life easier.",0,1414856765,null,0,1414857006,0,clq08ci,t3_2kynmr,t1_clq08ci,t3_2kynmr,null,1426243018,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I absolutely agree that experts should be brought into to advise the government, and policy should be evidence based. However, having experts vote on things directly don't work. Ignoring for a moment the fact that most lords are already affiliated to one political party or another, and vote along party lines, and many are not experts in anything, lets say they all were independent experts. Having one lord who is an expert in stem cell research doesn't help, because most lords won't be. They can still be outvoted by experts in other fields who don't really know what they're voting on. The nature of expertise means it's very specific, and that means for every subject the experts will be outvoted by the non-experts (in that field), even if everyone voting was an expert on something. 

So basically my argument boils down to:

1. The house of lords is already party political, not technocratic.
2. A technocratic house wouldn't really work anyway.
3.

One study did find in the **long term** wages were unaffected due to consistent economic growth. It also found however that migration as a whole benefited the economy by less than 0.5% of GDP. 

In the short term however, wages are depressed. It's a very basic economic model:

Supply increase while demand does not means a drop in price and that price is the price of labour, aka wages. 

They did not specify how long the ""long term"" is although seeing as the study looked at 1990-2010 you can assume it's about 20 years. Therefore, do you really expect people to be ok with working for a lot less now, or even being out of a job, because wages may or may not pick up in 20 years time?

They also noted that the vast majority of the study was done during an economic boom and so adverse affects of migration on the economy may have been understated as they were simply covered up by ever-growing prosperity and jobs. It would be interesting to do a 10 year study from 2008 to 2018 and see how migrants benefitted the economy, if at all.

I think Morison will definitely be brought off at some stage (he's struggled to have an impact today and frequently looked isolated), and maybe we'll go with two up front - this wide role doesn't seem to suit Antenucci at all and Doukara hasn't done much either, but we might look even more vulnerable without players out wide.

7) The Star-Whale is bigger on the inside, so it could easily fit inside its shell and still lay an egg the same size as itself (raises the question if a Galifreyan lifeform has come through a crack...what else?)
8) The Star-Whale will come back in 8,000 years to save its descendants (e.g Courtney's descendants) The Beast Below.

I quite liked the episode (in a lets run over here, now over here type way) but it really annoys me that it should and could have been much better continuity and plot wise.

Anyone have another scene/episode they would like to rewrite?

Aside from being a false dilemma, that isn't how the UK works... The UK is not mob rule, it's not even a direct democracy. Having limits on democracy is exactly what we have always had, it's not a change or some radical idea... 

Do you want us to directly elect judges too, the judiciary isn't democratic! We should force judges to fucking run for election and go on huge campaigns in their local area. Great fucking plan, that wouldn't go badly at all would it?

Democracy isn't a religion, it's not about whether one ""believes"" in it or not... Just because we acknowledge that a representative democracy is the best long-term system for running a country doesn't mean we want to craft some abomination of a system where populism rules above all else and there are no checks and balances in place.

&gt;Plus they'd have no democratic accountability, if they made terrible decisions or turned out to be nutters we'd still have to have them in office for their full term.

The same applies to elected politicians... Especially since we have a very bad track record of voting out nutters even when they DO come up for re-election. See Blair. Elected politicians can fuck up, serve their full term at the very least, and very likely get re-elected.

 I'm a big fan of Rodgers but he needs to admit that his current tactics aren't working and change things up. As much as I hate to say it, all the most successful managers in the game Mourinho, Ferguson etc were willing to change their tactics in games to suit the players and/or opposition, and to me , the reason Wenger isn't really considered on par with those managers is because he's too stubborn to change his tactics and philosophy similarly to the way Brendan is setting up the team now.

Of course the judiciary should remain independent of politics, but that's an entirely different kettle of fish. My point is that those who create laws should be elected, not those who enforce and apply them. That is how democracy works.

&gt;The same applies to elected politicians... Especially since we have a very bad track record of voting out nutters even when they DO come up for re-election. See Blair.

So your argument is that we cannot trust the electorate because they'll vote for nutters? If you really believe that to be the case then you don't believe in democracy.

He ages visably from the last time he gave his age in the classic series (953) until the TV movie, from the TV movie to *Night of the Doctor* and from *The Night of the Doctor* til *The Day of the Doctor.*  So unless he had been running the odometer in reverse for long enough to live to death at least once (and we know that it took Eleven spent 900 years on Trenzalore, aging to death) he couldn't possibly be only 900 afterward.  

The best way to cover the discrepancy is this:  The Eighth Doctor started over counting his age from when he regenerated.  This is something that actually happened in the books. He figured he was about 1009 when he regenerated, but was pretty sure he had lost count so started over, giving his age as ""three.""

Classic Who was largely consistent with the age increasing, from 450 with the Second Doctor, around 760 for the Fourth (but he lost count somewhere in there and needed Romana to remind him) 900 for Six and 953 for Seven.  New Who is also largely consistent with itself, but for some reason chose a number too low to fit with the ages given in Classic Who.

There are only two contenders other then Eleven for the longest Doctor, Eight and War, but I'm pretty sure neither of them can match 1100 years (200 before *Time,* 900 during.)  Eight because of some audio stuff, War because we know he aged to death.  If we assume that Nine was counting from when Eight gave up and started over, that means that Eleven was about a third of the Doctor's whole life.

I know this thread is a way for many of us to exorcise the bitter feelings of the past two summer transfer windows given how many of our signings panned out late, not at all, or have faded (example of each in order: Capoue/Lamela/Chadli, Paulinho/Soldado - you could argue these were pre-Bale, chiriches) and how liverpool's acquisitions were also players we had targeted (lovren + lallana at least).

Neither fanbase can be happy with losing our stars; spurs have just started to bed in many of our acquisitions from the summer before (and even then, we can only say about half of our transfers really worked: Lamela, Eriksen, Capoue, [maybe, if you factor in value] Chadli) and Liverpool can probably only be satisfied with Lallana at this point.

I know we are bitter about how the media repeatedly bashed us while pumping up one of our top-6 rivals, but it's more about the media than Rodgers. As a final point to consider, think about how excitedly optimistic we get whenever we comfort our slow start this season with articles about how ""Pochettino will become the next Rodgers."" Yes, these managers both came from smaller clubs that performed beyond their means through what we are led to believe is great tutelage and have had underwhelming first years (so far for Pochettino, fingers crossed), but at the end of the day this is another easy parallel for the media to use to write articles about football.",0,1414861070,null,0,false,0,clq1zso,t3_2kz02g,t1_clq1zso,t3_2kz02g,null,1426242126,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

I'd say you're right if we had full strenght team for the 3 months.

Remember that Lallana and Markovic didn't have almost any pre season. Can, Allen, Sturridge got mid to long term injuries in the first international break. Flanagan hasn't been seen since the first pre-season game. Suarez was sold and was banned anyway. And I wouldn't bet against some of our players playing with niggling injuries as there were several reports during players getting injuries in their national team training or matches (Lovren, Markovic, Henderson). 

All the injuries took away our power to rotate players. The players returning from injuries weren't in form and couldn't have been used as much as Rodgers would've like, I assume. The lack of rotation instantly hit hard as Sterling and other players were overused and lost form quickly. Remember that Sterling was in great form in the start of the season? Not looking anything like that anymore. 

Balotelli was great in his first half a season with Milan. The next full season he wasn't in great form. He was alright. But he hasn't been great for quite a while now. I mean unplayable great. Something like he was in Euros. So he was brought in to be number two striker behind Sturridge. With Sturridge being the main man he could have got enough time to adapt with the team and playing style so he could be the main man when called upon. That went sideways quickly as Sturridge got injured and it doesn't help that Lambert was unfit and a plan B and Borini was out of favour. All pressure fell on him. 

That is not a full strength team.

I could probably go on but you get the point. You can't possibly put this stuff on Rodgers.

I'm not saying we should just close our eyes to the problems, but fans do have sway on big decisions in a club and judging by our fan base we'll never show the patience required to become a top team unless it happens over night.

clearly differentiates between short-term and long-term impacts, **it is not clear for
how long ‚Äòshort-term‚Äô impacts may be expected to persist, and whether they are
likely to be significant in magnitude.** In addition, as described above, the speed of
the labour market‚Äôs adjustment may vary over time according to economic context
and other factors. Therefore the persistence and magnitude of short-term impacts is
a matter for empirical study. **The literature review in Chapter 6 considers the
empirical evidence in recent decades.**

And what does Chapter 6 say?...

&gt; ""**To date, there is still little evidence of any statistically significant labour market
displacement caused by EU migrants.** This could mean that EU migration has no
statistically significant displacement impacts, or that data issues have prevented
any impacts from being observed.
""

So, in theory there *might* be a *short term* effect on low skilled jobs, but nobody's yet been able to find any actual evidence for it.

This is why we have a post match thread. Because before, people weren't happy with just keeping it in the match thread. It's even arguable why all of these child threads that directly belong in the post match thread, such as this one, are even being posted. 
 
&gt;If you don't want it spoiled you should just stay off the internet in general tbh.
 
Fuck you, who the fuck are you to tell others what to do with their internet. This should be a place where everyone can come to, regardless of time and day and not have shit ruined for them because you want to karma whore with content that belongs in another thread. 
 
And I'm not even saying you shouldn't post these at all, just not immediately after the game. ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE IS A POST MATCH THREAD WHERE THIS BELONGS.

Arsenal are picking up form, while the top 2 spots are pretty much decided already. If United pick up any kind of form, and they will, especially in the latter half of the season when their lack of games will help then we have no chance.

We need 62 of 84 available according to your calculations. That is already a hugely tough task.

Your Group A says we need 29 of a possible 27. So basically we need to do better in the big games (Group C) compared to last season, which is impossible given the way things are.

false,dindane,lfc68,,"Not entirely relevant to this post but a point I want to make is that last season, the team was built around getting the best out of Suarez and Sturridge, and Sterling towards the end of the season.

 This season we've had neither of the two players that our team was built around. Lots of people are forgetting that they got us out of trouble so many times last season, for example in the same fixture as today, we were losing 2-1 I think, then Suarez and Sturridge combined brilliantly and scored to get us back in the game. 

Just those two players were responsible for over half our goals last season. This season, it seems to me that Brendan hasn't shifted the focus of the team from the quality of the strikers to the quality of the midfield as we have some fantastic midfielders but they're playing shite at the moment, as lets face it, Suarez + Sturridge &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Balotelli.

 The team is still built around Luis and Sturridge, even though Luis is gone and Sturridge has been injured all season. So my point is that people are underestimating the extent to which we were reliant on the quality of Suarez and Sturridge, and we really should have spent some more on proven quality in the summer, rather than potential. And perhaps Brendan should have changed his tactics more significantly to get the best out of the midfield rather than forwards, but I think he's banking on Sturridge and Balo clicking well when he comes back.

false,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"There is on-going Baltic air policing constantly since 2004. The recent events in Ukraine have obviously meant the policing presence has been strengthened. 

But I find it hard to compare the two. Russia is actively cock measuring, testing out response times and more than likely mapping RADAR coverage when they fly near our airspace.

NATO is maintaining air security of nations which have actively asked for it to be done, like the article you posted suggests, NATO has an increased presence in the area at the moment as a direct result of Russian actions. 
NATO doesn't fly over international airspace and encroach on other nations airspace, Russia does exactly that. 

That NATO actions in the story you linked and the Russian actions are very different things in my opinion.

I agree though, this has been happening for decades. There is no doubt NATO nations used to do it as well and I wouldn't be surprised if we still do. In the cold war the UK managed to discover a route uncovered by Russian RADAR which gave us the capability to carry out nuclear strikes on Moscow. 

The USA for the most part didn't take part in this sort of stuff in the later years, they were confident in their stealth technology so they didn't feel the need to probe Russian defences. Dare I say that's still the case today? (And for what it's worth, they were right to be confident!)

I'm sure NATO still does it, but not on the almost monthly basis the Russian's do.

Into the Dalek - Meh, okay

Robots of Sherwood - Very good, very funny

Listen - Excellent (except for the end scene in the barn which I thought ruined most of the ideas set up in the episode)

Time Heist - Good, probably some of the best pacing this series, it felt like it knew where it was going

The Caretaker - Okay, although it was too ""down to earth"" (literally) for me, not enough spacey/timey

Kill the Moon - Awful, so many plot holes and issues, definitely the worst this series (definitely one of the worst in years)

Mummy on the Orient Express - Excellent, felt like a proper Doctor Who episode

Flatline - Excellent, had some issues but for the majority was very good

Forest of the Night - Quite good, although I think it would have been nicer for The Doctor/Clara to have had a bit more input into the ""saving the Earth"" part of the plot. It was better than I expected it to be from the previous episode's ""next time"".

I only remember couple of games when we went with two holding midfielders. Southampton and WHU. Other matches we have tried to be as offensive as we can with one striker. The teams have hardly been defensive - Newcastle game is the first example when I've see Rodgers go unreasonably defensive.

The simple fact is that our attackers aren't in form and our midfielders aren't goalscorers. Our set-pieces have also been very tame. Today was the only example when our defender (or anyone) has got a good shot towards goal.

And we can't use the same tactics as last year when we don't have Suarez and Sturridge. ",0,1414866709,null,0,false,0,clq4h85,t3_2kze9l,t1_clq4h85,t1_clq3hw2,null,1426240967,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

1. Go slowly with the epilator. Slower than you think. Yes it might hurt more, but it gives a longer lasting, smoother result. If I don't, the epilator tends to break the hair rather than pull it out &gt; bumps!
2. Exfoliate as much as your skin can take! Sometimes I dry brush before showering, otherwise I use a homemade sugar and coconut oil scrub or my Korean Italy Towel in the shower. Every. Single. Day
3. I always epilate dry, after dusting some talcum powder wherever I'm doing it to help pick up the hair. Afterwards I use [this](http://www.pixibeauty.co.uk/glow-tonic) toner from PIXI. Glycolic acid for gentle chemical exfoliation and witch hazel stops any itching, it might sting a bit initially but it really helps. Around my lady areas and underarms where I am particularly prone to bumps I follow with a clear unscented deodorant stick (a stripper trick I learnt from Reddit, I don't know why, but it works)
4. Lots and lots of moisturiser. I either use a moisturiser with urea and lactic acid or coconut oil.
5. Keep your epilator clean by wiping out the tweezers with rubbing alcohol

For some people it still isn't enough, my sister still gets these lumps after epilating, albeit not as bad as when she didn't follow this routine.

It has a nice chart which I've [uploaded here](http://i.imgur.com/o6CQyiv.png) detailing the different out of court disposals.

You should note a cannabis warning is issued on the street as an alternative to arrest and prosecution and is basically a way of dealing with low level amounts for personal use without going down the full criminal justice route. The next step is usually a PND (fine) and then arrest and likely a caution. It's interesting that this is the only Class B drug to get this lenient treatment (Khat, a recent Class C, is the only other one I can think of with a street warning scheme) and I think shows the acceptance that cannabis is popular and widely used. On a personal note I know officers who get annoyed finding a small bit of cannabis on an otherwise ""normal"" person because now they have to do ""something"" and the cannabis warning is a good way of dealing with them without getting them fully in the criminal system. In terms of removing prohibition you'd need to speak to the government about that - all the while it's illegal we can't just let people carry on walking around with it if we find it on them!

Indictable offences are those which would ordinarily be heard in a Crown Court (i.e. serious offences) and summary are offences which are heard in Magistrates courts (think low level, like littering and minor assaults).

An interesting view of the figures in relation to targets is seen as well...

&gt;The increase to the 12 months ending March 2008 coincided with the introduction in 2001 of a target to increase offences brought to justice. The decrease post March 2008 coincided with the replacement of the target in April 2008, with one placing more emphasis on bringing serious crimes to justice. The latter target was subsequently removed in May 2010. 

If you have an interest in the justice system I actually recommend reading the report, it's not too ""business"" speaky and uses everyday language and summaries basic trends [download - PDF warning](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/346639/criminal-justice-statistics-april-2013-to-march-2014.pdf)",0,1414868169,null,0,false,0,clq54iv,t3_2kxwff,t1_clq54iv,t1_clpv3p1,null,1426240665,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

2) I don't see how this is a major issue, just needs to be taken into account.

3) There are a limited number of TV channels to compare against, and there's nothing stopping you from doing the analysis shortly after the event. Also, it seems like it could potentially be done 'live'.

4) Not sure where they mentioned this, but seems reasonable for a POC. Seems feasible that the technique could be refined for lower power.

5) Good point.

&gt; knowing the movie beforehand

Which isn't unreasonable for TV, there are a finite and small number of channels. To be honest there's also a reasonable limited number of movies out there and we don't know how effective this could be in the future.

It sounded like the smart meter resolution is pretty high, perhaps not enough for lower power displays.

---

&gt;Australian Term: To indulge in a sudden display of anger or frustration; to lose one‚Äôs temper. The phrase is usually used of an adult, and the implication is that the outburst is childish, like a baby spitting out its dummy in a tantrum and refusing to be pacified. (Dummy is a pacifier)


---

_'There's no reason for me to spit the dummy,' he said. 'Why do I have to be a rude cunt out of the car when I've demonstrated what I can do inside of it?'_

Canada exports its oil to the USA for oil refinement for example, does that mean Canada doesn't 'run the oil business' in Canada?

I think you can use entirely the same tactics as last year.  Sterling is a ready-made Sturridge replacement (albeit not quite at that level) and while Balotelli is no Suarez by any stretch, he's much better technically than he's shown so far and he is capable of some decent passes and hold up play.  

Show a bit of confidence in the players and maybe they'll surprise you is all I'm saying- that's sort of my point and just assuming the players we have suck too much to be relied upon to score goals in the manner we relied upon Danny and Suarez is a very negative statement and it's pretty obvious BR doesn't think they're good enough which at some level has to effect their on field demeanor.  I'd rather see us fail while trying to play good attacking football then watch us repeatedly fail while playing boring, unattractive, uninspired and largely insipid sideways and backwards football.

false,RubenMcGroin,null,null,"As already mentioned check the manual, my owners manual for my R125 has a 'periodic maintenance and adjustment' section that tells you most of what you need to know. Some sections are a bit vague unfortunately but you can google when it doesn't specifically tell you. The manual can also be found online very easy if you don't have one.

Things you want to get into a habit of checking are:

Oil! Every time you finish a ride check the oil. My R125 likes to get through oil pretty quick, as it doesn't hold much over a litre to begin with. The manual says to change the oil and filter every 1800 miles I believe, again follow the chart.

Coolant as well. Located at the front, stick your head down and you'll see it easy enough, although it's a bit of a squeeze.

Chain slack and lube. I check this after every ride and adjust about once a week, although I've just put brand new chain and sprockets on so you may not need to do it that often. Lube the chain frequently as needed. Again the instructions on how to do this are in the manual. Tip: You can do this without a paddock stand but getting one makes it so much easier!

Tyre pressures. Check frequently as you'll be surprised how much difference it makes to the feel/handling of the bike. Incorrect pressure will expend your tyres faster as well. The correct PSI is stated in the manual as I can't remember off hand.

Those are the most basic checks you want to get into the habit of. Everything else can be found within the manual and when you want to change/check/adjust etc whatever it is that needs it (brakes, valves, air filter etc)

And most of all, keep it clean! It's a fantastic bike that deserves to look good all year round! :)

&gt;Does the UK government own the oil refineries? They are private companies, not government assets. The oil rigs are all private assets. The government has nothing to do with them. They make money from the taxes.

&gt;Scotland wouldn't be 'running the oil business', private companies will continue to do that, as usual. And as per usual, companies will continue to buy oil, regardless of where it came from.

&gt;The government doesn't extract the oil and it doesn't refine it. The location of PRIVATE refineries has nothing to do with government assets.

&gt;Canada exports its oil to the USA for oil refinement for example, does that mean Canada doesn't 'run the oil business' in Canada?

I know this you dim wit. You are essentially repeating what I said: that the SNPs basis for Scotland post independence was a load of bullshit.

&gt;And not quite sure why you're talking about whiskey industry, tourism etc, they are not Scottish government assets. They again, are run by private companies.

See above.

&gt;""Assets"", is about government debt, share of proportional finances, gold, strategic reserves, government buildings, public databases, military assets, agreements, etc

Government Debt? Scotland would get all the debt associated with its people and institutions, regardless of whether or not it is 'disproportional' to the total contribution to the UK by Scotland. 

There, simple solution to that one.

Proportional finances? Scotland would get only what it had produced, nothing more, nothing less.

Again, simple.

Gold? Belongs to the British state, which would still exist minus Scotland, therefore Scotland gets nothing.

Strategic reserves? Again, returned to the British state. Scotland would get nothing.

Government buildings? Most likely sold to the Scottish government for a nice price.

Public databases? Belong to Britain. Scotland gets nothing.

Military Assets? Belong to Britain. Scotland gets nothing.

And so on and so forth, similarly. Simple.

The UK government would not have to bend over backwards to accommodate the Scottish.

The British government would take an Independent Scotland to the cleaners. And they would be fully supported by the rest of Britain, most of whom are sick and tired of the moaning and whinging and unjustified cries of 'oppression' by the scot nats.

Ninth - The Slitheen 'Trilogy.' Maybe it is because the face of those aliens kind of threw off my suspension of disbelief, but any of those 3 episodes I would rate as 'bad' (they are still good stories despite that - In fact, I would argue that Series 1 was pretty much one of the strongest series out of nu-Who).

Tenth - *Love &amp; Monsters* or *Fear Her*. I know this is going to cause some flack with people here, but I kind of rate Series 2 as one of the worst series for me. And to be selfish, it was for the fact that Tenth and Rose was pretty much shoved down your throat - I just wasn't a fan. But those two episodes (which sfdebris pretty much voiced my exact feelings about those two episodes) and the fact that they were broadcasted back to back kind of put me off of Nu-Who for awhile.

A close third would be *End of Time*. The last 20 minutes was phenomenal but the other 115 minutes was just really bad fluff. I know people give *Time of the Doctor* flack because it should have been somewhat of a two parter, but I give End of Time the same flack as it should have been a 90 minute one parter. It just dragged on...if it wasn't for the ending, I would have called the episode boring and bland.

Eleventh - I would have put *Victory of the Daleks* up there, but IIRC that one was mostly because BBC 'forced' a Dalek episode and Moffat wanted to move away from them and tell different stories. For that, I try and give that episode a pass as I feel it wasn't his fault. But it is still not a **BAD** episode, but you can just get the vibe that this episode was forced.

But for me, I would have to say either *Vampires in Venice* or *The Power of Three* mostly because once enough for me and I never watched it again after that.

As for Twelfth, I kind of want to hold off making a judgment on that until Series 9 comes out as I actually love the changes in Series 8. The tone and everything else just works for me.

* UKIP. Chances are if the next government is Labour, it won't be because labour has done well... far from it... it will be because UKIP has done well and split the Tory vote, costing them dozens of seats in Tory:Labour marginal seats. i.e. 30% labour, 25% Tory, 25% UKIP constituencies.

&gt;so there is a lot of room for investment in renewables. 

Whilst also destroying the nation tourists come to see in massive numbers, crippling your tourism industry. 

Scotland has already started to see a fall in the number of people visiting the highlands since Salmond built windmills on half of the highland moors.

&gt;We produce enough renewable energy to power every household in Scotland

So why does Scotland still rely heavily on fossil fuels?

Oh, I know! It is because, barring hydro and geothermal which are both technologies Scotland doesn't use, Wind is the most efficient renewable power source, at roughly 20% efficiency.

So, yea, keep dreaming.

&gt;so as that industry grows and we become a net exporter in not just oil but renewable energy too

And how would Scotland store the energy for transport? Technology to do that doesnt exist yet.

If you arent planning on storing the energy, who is going to pay for the massive infrastructure investment and construction needed to make such a scheme possible? How is it going to be done?

And connection to Europe would have to go through rUK waters (if you wanted costs to not be absolutely astronomical), so how would you get planning permission?

I don't think you truly understand the difference ticket prices make in team sports.

This is a generalization so it's not the unquestionable truth, but lower prices attract more hardcore supporters. Not saying that all upper middle class and rich fans are quiet and lousy supporters but a lot of them are. This is generally because cheaper prices means less people are phased out and there's a higher chance of you getting hardcore fans. Look at the Bundesliga. Their ticket prices are much cheaper than PL team tickets and you can tell in the atmosphere. Some of that is purely on culture, but it's mainly not pricing your fans. In the American football (NFL), there's a team called the Dallas Cowboys who's fans have become quieter and quiet ever since their owner starts jacking up the prices.

im just wondering even if we have lower ticket prices how that will result in more ""good fans"" coming and those tickets not being taken by people who can now afford them that would also be shit fans. less shit than the rich fans but shit none the less.

i understand the argument that cheaper prices can lead to more hardcore fans showing up. and im making a generalisation but those more hardcore fans will be the poorer ones. i get that. 

im saying our club doesnt have that Chelsea is notorious for being supported by the well off. my only concern is that chelsea fans are well off people or people supporting from around the country who wont be great fans. i accept your point higher prices means richer people getting tickets and going by stereotypes they arent the ones likely to be good fans. 

Someone in the comments can tell me i'm speaking out of my ass but this problem isn't just prices. it is the type of fans Chelsea attracts. Chelsea isn't a club for locals, its not that family like club you get in poorer areas where there is a much bigger sense of ""togetherness"" i.e. in Liverpool and poorer places up north where their football teams will be the pride of the area. I wonder how many ""good chelsea fans"" there are out there compared to the amount of good fans other teams have packing their stadiums. i could be completely wrong and thousands of great chelsea fans could not be turning up because they cant afford tickets. but as i said before you do get ""poorer"" football fans who still go to nearly every match and have season tickets because they prioritize supporting the club in their life.",0,1414872489,null,0,1414872725,0,clq7206,t3_2kzs1a,t1_clq7206,t1_clq6xhl,null,1426239764,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Obligatory disclaimer: I am not an economist. And this explanation is obviously reductionist - in the real world things are always more complicated.

Obviously, 1 person doesn't literally create 1 job. Rather, they create lots and lots of fractions of jobs. For instance, a supermarket employs enough check-out staff to serve the number of customers they have. If the population of the area served by the supermarket goes up, the supermarket has more customers, and needs more staff. In our 1-person example, they obviously don't need to hire a whole new person to cater for 1 new customer; the new customer will probably take up a few [person-minutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-hour) each week, so the shop might need to pay for perhaps one extra shift per year.

But this tiny effect applies to every business or public service which serves this new person: cab firms, bakers, libraries, GPs, funeral directors, utility companies, interior decorators... all these extra bits of work need doing. When you examine the effect over a large number of immigrants, it does actually work out as new jobs being created.

To look at it another way: If we ignore (for the sake of simplicity) imports/exports, any economy needs to **supply** enough goods &amp; services to satisfy the **demand** of it's population of consumers. If all else remains equal, then increasing the population must increase demand, which means supply needs to increase to meet that demand.

(**EDIT:** If the average amount of demand created by one consumer in the economy were not at least equal to the average amount one person can supply, then there wouldn't be enough jobs to go around, even with zero immigration. Ideally, the average person generates more than they consume, giving us surplus we can export.)

If an economy *doesn't* provide enough jobs for all the workers in that economy, then there is something wrong with that economy, like a recession. The way governments try to fix a problem like that is usually to try and boost consumption.

To look at it yet a third way: If the lump-of-labour fallacy were true, then every time a British child entered the workforce, there would be fewer jobs to go around.

Came out looking a little better in the second half, though still being outplayed. Finally got the opportunity to take the game to them and were doing phenomenally until Jonjo's red. After that it was time to bunker in. 

Still not quite impressed with Bafe, though he did well to relieve the pressure on the back four a couple of times in that last 20 minutes. I also thought Tom Carroll was great coming on for Gylfi.

false,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"I think this comment is really dumb, and I'm honestly surprised people are upvoting it.

There is still a transfer committee. Rodgers is part of the transfer committee. If BR was here when a player was bought, he signed off on it. The committee and owners have said time and again that they will not buy players that BR doesn't want. So to break down the transfers as ones that the committee did versus Rodgers is really, really stupid and intentionally inflammatory. Not to mention, how would you ever know which targets were whose if that was actually how transfers worked anyway? Also, you forgot that BR and the committee also wanted Sanchez, Falcao and supposedly inquired about Cavani. The problem is, the top talent from abroad you are shouting about doesn't want to come to Liverpool. Period. It isn't FIFA. It isn't about us not matching transfer amounts or wages. They do not want to come here when they can go to other sides.

Saying he won't buy a defensive mid of any type is due to the system he favors--more of a total football type system. Henderson, Allen, Gerrard, Lucas, Coutinho and Lallana all have a defensive role of some type when they are in the side. The idea in midfield is that you have two holding mids who have the ability to play offensively or defensively. Having someone like Wanyama in the side would be a waste and stop fluidity. It's why even now Allen and Lucas struggle to play in the system effectively, as neither has a broad enough skill set to score goals or get assists while also making tackles and shielding the back 4. To play someone like a Mascherano in the side would then severely limit the support that the other midfielders can provide. Someone needs to drop in and be able to distribute the ball to the attackers when the CBs/GKs play the ball out from the back. Masch couldn't do it, so you's still have to play Gerrard, leaving Henderson to cover fucktons of ground and support the striker, with the wingers out wide.

Your point about his tactical stubbornness *this year* is correct. Last year he did fantastically well tactically and we were calling him a genius. We weren't wrong, he just has been insistent on making his preferred system work without Suarez here, as I assume he now considers the system to trump his talent. Yes, that is dumb, but it doesn't mean he is now a great man manager but a shit tactician.",0,1414873962,null,0,false,0,clq7pcu,t3_2kz8fe,t1_clq7pcu,t1_clpz7wv,null,1426239462,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

I don't think we've played pragmatically by choice lately. The team has been set up to play quick, attacking football, but it just isn't working at the moment. We gotta find our mojo again. For example against QPR. The talk before the game was that they want to start really quickly but it was still very slow start from us and QPR took the initiative almost instantly, we never really recovered in the first half. 

I think the pragmatic approaches would be the games when we use Gerrard and Lucas together in midfield by choice. So far we have done it only against Soton, I think. Other times have been forced by injuries.

secondly, BR signed Sturridge and has played him well.

thirdly, BR has developed Sterling into a top player, world class talent.

Look, we're 10 games in and it's a close table (except for Chelsea, who are the best team on paper and are the team in best form). after next game, we could be in the top 5, and no one will be as dramatic as they are being today. it's too early to call for BR's head. have some perspective.

I do think that with the amount of new signings we have made, we are in for a tottenham kind of season, unfortunately. I hope I'm wrong, and I hope we pick up the form we had after Christmas last season.

I support Rodgers unless we are outside the top 5 come July. we spend too much to finish outside europe. the last thing I want to see is a change of manager mid season, unless BR loses the dressing room, which I can't see happening atm.

saying Rodgers is shite is just an overreation. no one said that at the end of last season. and to say Liverpool was good because of Suarez is saying my professor is only good because I did well at the exam.",0,1414874773,null,0,false,0,clq82fa,t3_2kz8fe,t1_clq82fa,t1_clpyz8b,null,1426239292,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Overall, I stand by myself for now that the new-look team needs time and both, manager and players, need to look at themselves. 

But I meant that last part hypothetically. Like when Rodgers starts to get it right, it might still take a lot of time for players to get it right.

If you've already got a mortgage, you'd maybe be better off setting up an easy access savings account/good interest current account (ie santander 123 account) where you can have an ""emergency"" fund, while still setting your money to work for you. 

Given you asked for information though, I can share knowledge from my personal experience. 

They work by the card provider setting you a credit limit (say ¬£5k) which is the amount they're willing to allow you access to. APR is the rate of interest you pay on any use of the card - moneysavingexpert has some excellent guides on APR in more detail. A balance transfer is where the card provider will allow you to transfer a portion of your credit card limit to another account, be it a current account, another credit card, etc. I've used balance transfers to avoid paying interest on credit cards for a while, basically before the interest free period runs out I will get a new card and transfer the balance - not ideal but unfortunately I owe a bit on my credit cards and it's the most financially viable way to manage that. Also, balance transfers generally (if not always) incur a small administration fee (c. 1-3% of the amount being transferred). 

Incidentally, take note of my last point above and don't burn through your credit limit just because you can. You're literally buying your way into debt with credit cards. 

Finally, the best advice I'd give is start with a card with a small credit limit and short interest free period. These will generally have limits &lt;¬£1k and interest free periods of 3-6 months, with big APR after this period. As long as you stay smart, you can use the card til, say, a month before the interest free runs out then pay it off. That way, your credit score will benefit but you won't incur interest.

i just feel like he doesn't get the inside the box... he always shoots from outside the box or just passes the ball and lingers on the outside of the box. If you were to look at where he took all his touches you would think he was a midfielder because he got more touches in our half then inside the box, and not just today.. in most games he only touches the ball 1 or 2 times in the box every game


EDIT: about my urgency comment before, you can even hear the commentators saying that his attitude is affecting the team because when someone tries to pass to him and he doesn't get the ball half of the time he throws his arms like he is a sulking child",0,1414875539,null,0,1414875816,0,clq8enw,t3_2l06sn,t1_clq8enw,t1_clq87zb,null,1426239134,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I think if Mirallas had been there (or Deulofeu) there might have been more incision.

Too slow and predictable in the attack. They stifled the flanks and got 10 men behind the ball. Credit to Swansea their tactics were spot on. Bony should have been sent off though and the officiating was so shite. 

Pienaar was poor and Naismith needs a game out. Barkley is still not 100% but gives glimpses of the phenomenal player he is when he makes those surging runs

I cannot help but laugh at the absolute nonsense you've started off with. The only person that actually thinks renewables are going to cripple the tourism industry is Donald Trump. Have you been to the highlands in recent years? If yes, you know that it is absolute nonsense that ""half of the highland moors"" have wind farms on them. If no, I recommend it - it's lovely in July. Whilst tourist visits have declined, tourist expenditure has risen - which results in greater revenue produced. http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Tourism (this is research commissioned by the Scottish government and done by visitscotland.org)

Scotland doesn't rely heavily on fossil fuels because, as I said, higher GDP per capita than Italy without oil - in addition Scotland's revenues are only around 15% generated by oil. It's 30% in Norway. And Scotland does use hydro electric power, so you're spouting off some more nonsense there.

&gt; And how would Scotland store the energy for transport? Technology to do that doesnt exist yet.
If you arent planning on storing the energy, who is going to pay for the massive infrastructure investment and construction needed to make such a scheme possible? How is it going to be done?

Ever heard of the national grid? rUK isn't going to be producing anywhere near as much energy as Scotland, and we're going to have loads to spare. It's a partnership made in heaven - I didn't say we'd be exporting power overseas. Unless they're not going to accept the green power we want to sell them in which case they're as mad as you are.

You're getting confused with what a striker can do in a front two, he can drop off and have a lot of freedom. If you're alone, you must run in behind defenders, mainly diagonally.

Now this could be fixed with two simple reforms, to make appointments to the house of lords for a fixed amount of time rather than for life, and to limit the number of appointments that can be made in a year. That way the crisis of the ballooning house would be averted, it would remain the same size. But even getting these simple reforms past all parties in the house of commons and the house of lords would be very difficult.

It's not Rodgers fault they didn't come, he tried to improve our first team with players but just didn't work out. We had to settle for our 3/4/5th choice players on top of losing the best striker in the world, doubled by losing the most prolific goal scorer we have through injury for God knows how much longer.



Our performances have been flat, dull, and uninspiring. If you want to blame Rodgers for that? Go ahead. It's his team, his tactics, his squad selection. I don't think anyone will deny we've been well below par this season. But to blame Rodgers for not getting better attacking players is blindingly stupid considering he set out his targets but our transfer committee for the past two years has failed to get them. Salah chose money, Costa chose Atletico another season, we got screwed over Kono, Bayern wouldn't let Shaqiri go, Sanchez chose London, and Remy failed a medical suppose dly(and is currently injured as well). How can you pin those on Rodgers? 


His defensive transfers outside of Moreno/Manquillo? Horrendous. Sakho was almost frozen out before his injury, Lovren is not good enough, letting Agger go, while probably the right move after him saying his body couldn't hold up to the BPL anymore, is looking silly....and we all know the problems with Migs.

Then it is useless. Independent studies, or you have nothing to stand on.

&gt;and it is mainly civil servants (i.e. government workers with no political affiliation

PFFT! You really believe that? Honestly? You are pathetically naive.

&gt;so you are not going to get any sources that are not Scottish government documents.

Then you dont have a leg to stand on.

&gt;Whilst tourist visits have declined, tourist expenditure has risen

But will that trend continue? If so, how can you be sure?

Tourism might well continue to decline, or will accelerate in its negative trend. Leading to a loss over the long term.

&gt;Scotland doesn't rely heavily on fossil fuels because, as I said, higher GDP per capita than Italy without oil

Oh, so Scotland doesnt get most of its power from non-renewable source then? Someone better tell the government statistics that little 'fact'......

&gt;in addition Scotland's revenues are only around 15% generated by oil.

Ah, another little nail in Salmonds dreamland. How wonderful.

&gt;And Scotland does use hydro electric power, so you're spouting off some more nonsense there.

Oh, gee, 9%. Wooooooow.

If you are going to be pedatic, Scotland uses a small amount of Hydro, but nothing game changing. Which means in the great scheme of things, it is a non-factor.

&gt;Ever heard of the national grid?

Yes, and? How are you going to get your power to other countries?

Last time i Checked, the UK national grid didnt extend to continental Europe.

&gt;rUK isn't going to be producing anywhere near as much energy as Scotland

The fact that the government is commissioning and planning for a whole new range of nuclear stations, as well as the growth of shale gas (and similarly minimal polluting fossil fuels) in the power industry totally passed you by then, did it?

&gt;It's a partnership made in heaven

Why would we want your expensive energy when we could just import more cheap energy from france and its nuclear stations?

&gt;I am stunned that so many are arguing that private companies providing election services can police their own compliance with electoral law. Tell me, would you be the same if we were talking about a private company that ran electronic voting machines? Can they have secret processes to decide how they comply with the law too?

That is a totally different issue, and as a lawyer you would understand this.

This is an issue of increasing automation, which our economy needs to adapt to deal with, and unrelated to immigration. 

----

Even if you don't need a cashier to sell you the stuff, someone still had to grow the food, drive it to the warehouse, from the warehouse to the supermarket, someone had to put it on the shelf, some manager had to decide how much to charge for it and where to display it. And don't forget all the work that goes into designing, manufacturing, and maintaining those self-checkout machines.

Interesting concept- what happens when we die- not exactly original but executed well

Great CGI- the Nethersphere looks amazing

Mostly well directed (by a woman, which is good)

Decent dialogue- stuff about caring too much for betrayal to make a difference

Good to see (hear) the Cybermen them show up

Killing Danny unceremoniously

Oh wait he's gonna be brought back to life isn't he: still bad (does no one remember Rory?)

Why the Master? Why not the Rani? Or someone new?

Seven Cybermen at the end aren't impressive at all- not exactly an 
invasion is it?

Clara threatening the Doctor turned out to be a 'dream'- boo

Missy's actress is ridiculously hammy

""I'm not going to kill you until you say something nice""; proceeds to say something nice

That whole scene could have been scrapped really

Why do bad guys never shut the fuck up and just kill people, this just shows that she's easily stalled because she fucking stalled herself fucking sort your shit out

Missy kissing the Doctor

Missy hiding behind the holo-text- why?

Missy pretending to be an android

The TARDIS finding Danny was bollocks

Why did the TARDIS not know where they were- they were just in London (as per)

Again, are you serious? There is no reason to believe the tourism trend will reverse, just because it *might* reverse is no reason to believe that Scotland couldn't survive on its own.

And regarding reliance on fossil fuels - *every* country in the world produces most of their energy using fossil fuels. But scotland is on track to be one of the first countries that 50% of electricity will be produced by renewable sources by 2015 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-29360934.

Are you not aware that rUK would be a different country if Scotland were to be independent? In fact, England and Wales are technically different countries already, they're just in political union.

Importing more cheap energy from France how exactly? Using the technology that doesn't exist yet that you were talking about in one of your earlier comments? And shale gas a fossil fuel, and therefore a finite resource.

Total speculation against evidence on your part.

&gt;Oh, so Scotland doesnt get most of its power from non-renewable source then? 

At the moment it's roughly a three-way tie between nuclear, fossil fuels and renewables, with the latter increasing and the former two decreasing every year.

&gt;Ah, another little nail in Salmonds dreamland.

Salmond, to the best of my knowledge, has never claimed that oil accounts for more or less of Scotland's GDP than it actually does. What are you talking about?

&gt;Why would we want your expensive energy when we could just import more cheap energy from france and its nuclear stations?

Oh, but how are you going to do that, seeing as:

&gt;Last time i Checked, the UK national grid didnt extend to continental Europe.

Bit weird how you think Scotland has no capacity to *export* energy yet the rest of the UK has the capacity to *import* it, no?

&gt; RECOMMENDATION: The Scotland Act enables the Scottish Parliament to increase or decrease income tax rates in Scotland. In addition to extending this power, we will also introduce new **Scottish Progressive Rates of Income Tax, so that the Scottish Parliament can increase the rates of tax in the higher and additional bands**. For the first time, the Scottish Parliament will be able to **alter both the level of tax and the progressivity of the tax system, but without the risk that a Scottish Government could force tax competition within the UK by cutting only the top rates, to the detriment of public services.** Labour in the Scottish Parliament would be able to use these powers if a UK Government did not set fair taxes at these levels.

The show lost a good few million viewers when David Tennant left and Matt Smith took the role. It would suffer a much bigger loss if they changed the gender of the main character. 

It is a pointlessly large risk and I think you're sadly mistaken if you think people would like it more.

It's not like people immediately give The Doctor respect - he earns/manufactures it. If she's written well, a female Doctor can do this too.

My point is there is no reason for the character to be male. None, besides 'it might upset people' and 'it's just like that'. As I said, The Doctor is a character with limitless possibilities.

If not, my advice would be talk to the Advisor, taking in evidence of both offers if you can.  I don't see any reason they can't move the BM interview if they've set them up in the first place, there'll be a bunch of people and they just need to shuffle the times around.

They're essentially failing at their job if they move to stop you getting a better job that pays more, however.  

If it does get to the ridiculous situation where you informed them, they flatly refused to help, then got you sanctioned for attending one of two interviews at the same time, it's time for letters to the DWP manager, the Ingeus manager and your local MP.  From what I hear they hate it when the MP gets involved and asks why they're screwing around genuine cases.  Also get straight onto Citizens Advice.

I do however think that it's mainly a rarity of really nasty people people given a glimmer of power that result in the more stupid or vindictive sanctions however, I hope so.

Why?

&gt;We'd have lower energy costs and more manufacturing in the UK if we were out of the EU.

How do you equate that? Seriously, how do you equate higher energy costs and lower production costs at the same time?

&gt;I see the importance in grammar schools, and how they can benefit our society a lot (UKIP want more of these)


This isn't an official policy, nor is any of your other claims.

&gt;No tax on the minimum wage (stop crippling the poor right?)

That's a pretty ""lefty"" polcy, and I agree.

&gt;I do think we waste too much money on foreign aid that isn't properly used, if we had a better system instead of it going to the totally wrong people I would support it more. 

Foreign aid actually brings us an net income.

I tried it once with some homebrew. I suppose it gives a kick, but I would rather enjoy a few decent pints.

You can get strengths of 15%+ using wine yeast, a bit like drinking sherry, and with similar after effects if you over do it. Sounds like this one is naturally brewed to 32%, I guess they must have some special kind of yeast

Instructed a local conveyancy solicitor, did a bit of paperwork here and there and passed my solicitor's details onto the landlord, they did all the usual searches and things and sent the results.

I've always had a good relationship with the landlord, never any issues on either side.

The thing to remember as well is Britain's ""immigration problem"" vs a local ""immigration problem"".

If you take the mass of the UK population and assume everyone lives in the same place all this maths and logic works perfectly. In fact, if the UK had equal access to services and jobs it would all be fine.

What the main problem is that there *isn't* equal access to jobs and services around the UK, so certain *areas* have problems with services and jobs, because all the immigrants are clustered there.

If the UK was better at spreading out it's businesses and infrastructure, as well as directing immigrants to areas not already under pressure, we wouldn't have so much of a perceived problem. Instead they tend to congregate in the only areas they can afford, which are often the ones without jobs etc. to begin with.

Likewise it's worth pointing out studies have shown that anti-immigrant opinions are actually strongest where there is below average immigration.

Before the season started there was a lot of people outraged that people dared predict us finishing outside the top 4. Hindsight's a wonderful thing but some of the comments people made were just unrealistically optimistic and a lot of the the things people were dismissing have came true.


Neville said he thought United would get Top 4 over us, which was met with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2dbq3y/gary_neville_says_liverpool_wont_be_in_the_top/cjnyvnk). 

One of the comments there was ""We proved how well we can play without Suarez in pre-season, but of course, pre-season doesn't matter guys! 


No one yet has given me a solid point as to why we will struggle to get top 4. Champions League games keep coming up as an excuse, but have they seen the size of our squad? Only concern that this whole sub voices and I agree with is that we lack depth in our strikers. That's about it. We can comfortably rotate our squad that we play our best 11 come CL and then have good enough squad to beat Aston Villa or whoever we would face the same week."" 


People especially on here drastically overestimated our squad, whether they actually believed it or were trying to convince themselves.


Another one ""Fuck the biased little cunt. He's just making an 'edgy' prediction so he can look clever at the end of the season if by some miracle he is right. Let me guess he thinks his beloved Scum will win the league?"" 


Apparently it would be a miracle if we missed top 4?


Then on a post saying ""Everyone on /r/soccer has us finishing 5th, do you agree?"" there was this post:


""Most of them are just seeing the basics. Best player gone; no one to replace best player; bringing in young players; spending money on as many players as spurs; champions league to deal with, holy shit Liverpool have no chance of getting 4th! Yeah, if they'd actually look into it then they might realise that everything has went a lot smoother than they think. Even something like the silver lining of Suarez leaving being that we can now play our preferred 433 with a lone striker would get downvoted to shit over at /r/soccer because they think we're delusional and trying to comfort ourselves.
I can't wait to bask in some more hate next season when we 'over achieve'.""


Go through any posts here in the next week and check off the reasons people list as to why we have been poor. Nearly every one of them are listed in that post from months ago as what the uneducated masses of /r/soccer were saying. It turns out we might not be the best at making objective predictions except for [this lad who was actually spot on with this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2d81v7/unpopular_opinionspredictions_for_the_upcoming/cjn0xpg)",0,1414884951,null,0,false,0,clqchk5,t3_2l06sn,t1_clqchk5,t1_clqb4xw,null,1426237139,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Your can believe rape is right or wrong and I cannot change your soul, if such a thing exists.

Let us go back to morality.  Is it moral to protect people with a primitive view on sexual consent from raping little girls?  Is it moral to protect these rapists because they vote the same as one does?  

Actually, if one's highest purpose is to get political power, excusing rapists that vote the same way as one is moral.  Is this the morality of which you speak?  Because by your statements, it seems it is the morality that you have.

Very well written and it's great to see comments with actual dept to them on here.

When I said problems tactically I meant this year as obviously last year went great for big chunks tactically (other chunks that people conveniently forget were less so) 

I know the committee is still in affect but it was made public knowledge that Rodgers demanded full veto and an ability to completely bypass the committee in his new contract. 

Rodgers obviously had to sign off on signings but it seems sometimes he might have agreed on a list a one of his lower preferences were signed (Sakho, Sturridge) and he reacts accordingly in the media (last chance) or in his line ups (Sakho)

I broke the transfers down to obvious ones and guesses hence the question marks. We'll never know the full inner workings of the club but I can make educated guesses

I never ""shouted"" about any signings

I fully agree that this isn't FIFA

I know we have a limited range of players we could sign. We were never going to get Costa, Sanchez, Fabregas, Di Maria, Falcao etc... 

For financial reasons or otherwise. I believe we signed the wrong players available to us, Manolas for Roma was offered around as was Isco, Carvalho was available for big bucks, maybe Berardi, gonalons, M'Villa, Lacazette or even Immobile? Up front. 

Also a DM would suit at the base of our midfield, that much was glaringly obvious every time Stewart Downing ghosted past Gerrard. If that DM could pass a la Song even better.

I'm happy I was right. It's good to see The Master back, Michelle Gomez killed it. She was much more flamboyant than previous versions with the possible exception of Eric Roberts, and she seemed to be enjoying herself greatly - especially when she was eavesdropping in on the Doctor's ranting.

Also, to clear something up - **there IS no afterlife.** The Nethersphere is a construct powered by a Matrix Dataslice - as 12 puts it, a ""Time Lord hard drive"". One of the things the Time Lord Matrix was used for is uploading the minds of dead Time Lords so that they could still be of use to Gallifreyan society. It contains a pocket universe (6 and the Valeyard visited it, 5 got stuck in it).

false,jonjennings,null,null,"You and me both. When I first lived on my own, the new Argos catalogue was an event to look forward to. Would read through every page when I got it home - plan out the things I was going to buy, look for things that were new since last year.

Having said that, _shopping_ at Argos was horrible... the slightly tatty stores, products packaged in no-name cardboard boxes to save 20p, but worst of all... the musak... horrible off-key cover renditions of all your favourite pop songs that never quite got it right. Sometimes I couldn't stand it in there long enough to buy stuff and left empty-handed because of the music. Actually, I've just remembered that I think my brother had a couple of those ""not the original artist"" Top of the Pops albums with covers [like this](http://oi55.tinypic.com/2a9zbkn.jpg)... you could get them for 50p in the Woolworths bargain bins.

But about the desire for new things... I think that's a 'getting old' thing. Our base level for what a phone/tv/camera can do is set when we're a teenager and then every year we see things getting better until we can't believe how amazing they are. A teenager today sets their base level for those items at what they see around them so next year's models with bigger screens, wifi, voice activation are significant upgrades whereas, to us oldies, it's ""why would I want that on a vacuum cleaner?"". The fact that it's got a touchscreen is not exciting to them... it's expected. (Ever take photos of a toddler? They immediately rush up to you to see the photo... they have no comprehension of a photograph where you'd have to wait weeks to finish the roll and then send it away to be developed)

Today's teens will continue to be amazed by technology for 20 years before  they too enter the ""it's already got RFID sensing to automatically see what's inside it, see when I run out and message the store to add it to my weekly delivery - why would I want my fridge to also talk to me in a choice of 10 different AI personalities?"" stage.

I've no interest in a 4K, 3D, 60"", curved-screen TV. After the 21"" no-remote Hitachi that was one of the most expensive things my parents bought during my teenage years, a base-model 40"" LCD is enough luxury for me.

I used to shake my head at my parents - all those things they've still got in the house that are slightly tatty, incredibly old and not as functional as the latest models - technology and kitchen stuff are the two main areas that always made me turn my nose up. Now I look around my own house and see I've become the same. My kitchen knives are twenty years old - they're perfectly good... quality brand I paid a lot of money for and still work well... why would I contemplate changing them? Exactly the same argument my parents used to put forward about their knives that were an engagement present. Plenty of other 20 year old things... crockery, clothes horse, some furniture - if they still work and they still look good, why would I change them? Something I couldn't comprehend when I was a 20-something surrounded by new things and looked at my parents surrounded by things they'd had since I was in primary school.

Third, It is not sexist to say you don't want a characters gender changed. Media relies on character development to thrive otherwise a new character may as well have been created. Some people believe the master changing gender undermines the character development and was done to fulfil the Political correctness brigade and they are entitled to that opinion.

Fourth, NEVER base a reaction on the focal minority most people who are happy about the reveal won't be commenting about it and there are a fair share of trolls.

I thought it was maybe a ""tiny bubble universe stuck to the side of the bigger bubble universe"" type of thing, like in The Doctor's Wife.

All season, I was hoping this would be the outcome of the whole Missy thread, but I didn't think they'd actually go there. And then they did. I can't even.

Then Missy started talking about how she's a Time Lady and the Doctor left her for dead. And I thought, no, it's the Rani or something. Then she said he left her for dead, and I thought, Susan? No way. Then she started in on the Missy thing, and....Oh my god. Like my favorite team scored a winning touchdown in the super bowl with 5 seconds to spare.

That people would hold the minor party in a coalition out to dry for policies pushed for by the major party, overseen by a department led and run by that major party and then declare in a poll that you trust the major party more than the minor party on the very issue your angry about make the British public look like collective sufferers of Stockholm Syndrome. 

I have no hope for the future. When we change the voting system and have governments that are proportional to the popular vote every party will have at least a little say on government policy and will intermittently support policies they don't fully agree with in exchange for support on one of their own policies - that's how coalitions work; trading support because no one party has more than 50% of the popular vote so no one party can claim a total right to rule over 100% of the population.

However at this rate people are going to be saying ""Well, I know a military coup would be a bit crazy but at least you know where you stand with a military dictatorship. This lot just sell their principles out for little bit of power."" If you define principled politics as uncooperative single party government a majority of this country will always remain unrepresented by the government of the day. If we actually want to have a representative democracy we need to grow up a bit and stop criticising necessary compromise. Otherwise we'll end up with a polarised shit-slinging popularity contest not responsible government. Either we can have the current situation where a government representing about 30% of the population rule over the remaining unhappy 70% or we can compromise and get a bit of what we all want despite the fact that we disagree.

The Lib Dems got a bad rep after the whole student fees debacle, and have absolutely no chance at being re-elected. It's a shame as a lot of their policies are actually very well thought out.

The Conservatives have never been able to get themselves out of the ""old rich white men's club"" image, but perhaps they deserve this with some of the questionable ties to lobbyists they have.

I'm not sure if I can ever forgive Labour for a lot of the problems we face today, including their legacy of illegal wars and allowing the banks to make the awful gambles and decisions that led to the economic crisis. The ""New Labour"" shift to the right cements the party as one I will not vote for for a long time.

UKIP have earned a reputation as the BNP-lite, and spout nationalistic populist B.S. at every chance they get. I am diametrically opposed to their views, as I tend to support efforts to improve cooperation and positive amalgamation at a European and international level.

Rodgers has a lot of work to do and it's not just tactically. He should attempt to acknowledge that not once in his time as manager have we played great football with 1 striker. We won matches last year with either Suarez or Sturridge out, but the only ones we scored a lot of goals in were when Suarez grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck.

If you think about a kettle. (Electric)Kettles have been a mass consumer product for probably close to 50 years, possibly more. 

They've changed in design significantly. They now have a detachable base which makes them more convenient and safer. They have a water gauge. They can hold more water. They're probably quieter, more energy efficient and safer. Some even have LCD displays

But do people really go out and buy a new kettle just because a new function has been added?

I recently bought a new kettle, only because my previous one died after a long service. I got a half price Morphy Richards which looks much the same as the kettles in the Argos catalogue - although my one has LED blue lights when it's on. It's a great kettle, but it's just a kettle. It will just be used until it dies, even if they introduce kettles that play an mp3 ringtone once the water is boiled, or attach a 7"" Amoled screen around the circumference. 

Nowadays, what we did consider to be high tech, such as computers, tablets, smart phones, are just kettles. 

The lowest priced notebook (laptop) you can buy will be roughly equivalent in specs to the mid range notebook I bought 7 years ago, which still works perfectly fine. Gaming consoles are not as impressive as they were. Sure the new ones are better, but not that much better. They all play games far superior to any arcade machine ever made.  

Do we need smart watches? No. Not when we have smart phones, tablets, GPS units, portable gaming machines and whatever else. Why do we need another gadget that will offer minimal functionality over those items we already own.

I think you might be right about the desire for new things being an age thing. And I guess a money thing too. If I've spent $500 on a new phone just to see it dwindle in value to next to nothing, and then do that 2 or 3 times, sooner or later I'm going to be thinking to myself that that probably wasn't the wisest thing to do. 

I like what you say about base level too. This is how I've been thinking in the last few years. 

I think that I'm happy with everything I own. My phone, my notebook, my monitor, my TV, my car. 

Most things I own are ageing. Many people would consider a lot of the items I own to be in need of replacement, but I feel no such need - or rather, very little need. Sure, if I could buy a new, better monitor for $100 I'd do it, but not $500. Sure I want a PS4, but can't justify it yet. In fact I'm thinking that I'm going to sit out buying the PS4 until they release the PS5, so that I can be a full generation behind and be able to buy impressive games for next to nothing. Much the same with everything else. If my TV died tomorrow it wouldn't phase me. There's no way I'd buy a top of the range TV, I'd just buy roughly equivalent to what I have and the cost will be less than half of what I paid for mine. 

Totally agree with your wide screen TV being enough luxury - that's exactly how I feel. You know I've not watched a single blu-ray movie. I have no problem with DVD. It's DIGITAL VIDEO. 

At aged 20, most of us don't have an understanding of money. I'm sure that's a significant aspect to this subject. If your parents could get a new set of knives for $20, I'm sure they would, but they object to spending $200 or what have you to get a product of similar quality. If they were multi millionaires then the $200 would be insignificant and they would feel comfortable with a regular upgrade. For the rest of us we have to work hard for our money and have to spend it wisely.

Porto would have sold almost certainly and he would likely have come.  Martinez is proven and unsurprisingly having a good season again and is a player much more in the Sturridge mould.

Instead of Lambert/3rd striker, get Huntelaar.  Probably cost about double Lambert's fee, but well worth it.  Proven track record and again having a good year so far (4 for 8 in the league, 3 for 3 in the CL).  Or, if he's not available for some reason, Shinji Okazaki.  Had a great season for Mainz after moving centrally last year and is doing well again this year too (6 for 9 in the league, 1 for 2 in Europa) and would have likely been available for a similar sort of fee in the ¬£8M-10M range.

If you don't like any of those, then how about any two of Son (also having another good year and I really like him personally), Immobile (before he was snapped up by BVB for a little more than we paid for Balotelli), Bacca, Icardi, Ramos (before he also moved to BVB for about the same amount we paid for Aspas), or any number of others I'm sure others could throw out there.  Are they guaranteed to work?  Of course not, but most (particularly Martinez) would likely have been much better than Balotelli or Lambert.

There isn't really anyone like that on Who right now, except for maybe Gatiss, who of course is already effectively running Sherlock.

I would LOVE if they paid Neil Gaiman (or another Who fan who is a big name in general fantasy/sci-fi) HUGE money to do a one series head writer run, with a contained story (more like a 12-episode miniseries/serial, maybe finally rescuing Gallifrey proper - sort of an homage to the multi-episode serials of Old Who) and maybe even a one-series-only Doctor at the end of Capaldi's reign.

To completely remove yourself from history is to take no accountability for our current culture- a culture which is racist, whether you like it or not, and whether it's your fault or not.

By removing any historical and modern context of oppression, you're saying ""Hey, I know for hundreds of years white people have dehumanised black people, but let's all forget about that now.""

Blackface is nothing to do with ""moving forward."" Who does it help? White people. How do we progress by it? We don't. Conversely, who does the removal of blackface from our culture help? Black people.

&gt;Unlike the owners of other science fiction franchises, the BBC takes no position on canon, and recent producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea. The term has recently begun to appear __in mainstream press coverage__ [i.e. not by the BBC nor Who writers/producers] following the popular success of the 2005 Doctor Who revival.

As far as I'm aware, all writers have always been encouraged to simply write a good story, even if it means ignoring stuff which has been stated before.

There is no reason Torchwood cannot be an enjoyable show which does not feature an afterlife while Who cannot go against that as also an enjoyable show which *does* include an afterlife. The need for everything to evenly match up like it's in a balancing book is a silly idea which only eventually leads to stifling future creativity. If it's fun to watch and makes sense for that story/general era of the show, bring it on!

The fact is we know Danny definitively died. Unless The Mistress swooped in on her TARDIS, picked up Danny's body moments before death and saved him, while planting a decoy body on the floor, then he definitely died. Her doing that is almost as silly as the theories on how Sherlock survived his fall by planting a decoy.
