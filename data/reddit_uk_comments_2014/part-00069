Is that Dembele's fault? He dribbles past his marker, finds himself with space, looking to make a final pass - but no one has made the run.

JUST LIKE BALE USED TO.

Moussa is not at fault here.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;the failure of attacking players to penetrate should be blamed on the players on the field and the managers strategy, not the absence of an injured player.

I agree with you on this. Sure, Sherwood's not Sun Tzu when it comes to tactics, but having Eriksen allows the team to have the ball in a meaningful way. An example would be Dembele: hugely talented with the ball, but beating 2000 defenders by dribbling past them doesn't mean anything if he can't make a killer pass at the end. We lack that with the players we have. We can even see what he's trying to do. Look at our games where we lost under Sherwood this year. We always had a chance because we were in the box in part due to Eriksen's control of midfield.

Siggy has been played on the wing mostly this season, so we don't know how he'd do, but right now, if Eriksen's out, I'd like to give a 4-2-3-1 with him in the middle of the three a try. 

&gt;our resident midfield wizard Eriksen wasn't available for the game today

One possibly important distinction is that in private schools there is (surprisingly) no legal requirement for a teacher to be qualified. Of course all the better schools do generally insist on qualifications, but that factor might be of some interest to you as if you have demonstrable teaching experience, even of ESL, your lack of PGCE might not be a complete obstacle.

Another big difference is that private schools aren't bound by the national salary scale ([salary details here](http://www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/salary/teaching-salary-ranges)) but the flip-side of that is that the teaching unions are also usually far less active in private schools.

Finally private schools generally have smaller classes consisting of better-behaved children.

Quite simply at the moment the performance expectations for the supporters and even (from what it looks like) the board are not in line with where we are as a club.  In truth as a club we are much closer to Everton than we are Man City/Chelsea.  Yet Everton's expectations are more in line with what they are than ours are.  

If we want to move up to City/Chelsea there are realistically 4 paths....Spend an ungodly sum of money, Hire a brilliant coach, Spend money and Hire a brilliant coach or invent a new way.

We aren't likely to take the path that involves spending our way to the top.  And we sure as hell don't look creative enough as an organization to invent a new way to the top....means we can hire a brilliant coach and hope it gets us there at some point, but if we can hire a great coach who can impart a philosophy that is part of the entire club at least down the line we have a better idea of how to get a coach that fits the club rather than continually rolling the dice on different ideas every 3 years.

It's historical - although colloquially any private / independent school tends to be referred to as a public school, in fact it's only 7 of the oldest schools in Britain that are actually public schools, and they were called that at a time when schools were run by religious institutions or a trade guild, and only boys from a family with a connection to said institution / guild could go there. In contrast a 'public' school would take anyone who could pay for it.

Public school is always taken to mean an expensive private / independent school. The free schools that most people go to are known as State schools

JJ indicated in a post on SC that currently there are quite a few players who just don't seem inclined to care about what Tim says and there seems to be an attitude that many of them will outlast Tim.  He didn't provide names though.

However if what JJ is saying is true (he's an ITK so who knows) it sounds like Tim is losing the locker room which pretty much fucks us for the remainder of the season and insures that Tim won't be around come summer.

true,Ribs85,null,null,"My situation is somewhat unique, so I'll give some background first.

I like to go camping a bit, but Internet is important to me for those rainy days. So, I have two mifi units, one has an Ovivo SIM in it (£0/month 1gb of data), another has a Samba SIM in it (watch adverts for free data). These networks piggyback on Vodafone and Three.

So, ideally, I want something for my phone that isn't Vodafone or Three, so I'm more likely to get signal. So I currently use GiffGaff, £12/month for 'unlimited' data. Previously I have used EE, Vodafone, O2, and Three, so I have a good understand of most of the networks.

On major, major problem with GiffGaff; yes, you have an O2 signal, but you are at the BOTTOM of the queue for data. I've had several instances where I have a full signal on 3G, and get really, really slow data, especially in built-up areas.

This is caused by O2 customers using whatever they need, then Tesco Mobile customers using whatever they need, and then Giffgaff get the scraps behind those two.

Sometimes, it's literally unusable. I have Opera Mini installed on my phone for these instances, and even then it's not great.

Sometimes, however, it's 'just fine', but certainly not fast. I don't think I've had a speed test complete beyond 4mbit/sec. Which is acceptable, but not fast. For comparison, using the same phone, in the same locations, on Three, I often got 20-25mbit/sec, which was embarrassingly faster than my home broadband (which has since been upgraded, but was 6mbit/sec at the time). This was on a Nexus 4, so no 4G internet here, I got those speeds with Three's 'ultrafast' DCHSPA+ (I think that's right).

So soon I'm switching to Tesco mobile, as I rarely use more than 1.5gb a month anyway. With Tesco, I can get 2gb for £10 (as I know someone who works for Tesco, so get a better deal), slightly cheaper, and hopefully slightly faster, and I know I'll get good signal where I need it. And 2gb is 'enough' for me. Not for everyone, I grant you, but okay for me.

Oh yeah, and the 'unlimited' data/texts, it's not actually unlimited. If you go beyond 3gb/day (I think) they will cut you off and give you a warning. Not great for watching a lot of Netflix then. You also can't tether, which I think is okay. And I've read people getting cut off for using too many texts as well.

Oh, and if you EVER ask a question in the forums, brace yourself... You'll get the EXACT SAME ANSWER about 10 times. Case in point: http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Help-Support/Why-can-t-I-buy-a-12-gigabag-and-use-it-with-my-huawei-mobile/td-p/12177348 and it's fucking annoying. All caused by people getting ""kudos"" and money off their bill, so a lot of users have pre-typed responses so they can ""get in there first"" and get an answer ""accepted"" to earn even more. So you get answers that are 'kind of' correct, but don't really directly answer what you're asking. This is worse than eBay customer service, and that's saying something.

Overall, the network isn't BAD per say, it's just not very good either. The outages are annoying, the slow speeds are annoying, and the outright lying about 'unlimited' stinks, and the 'customer service' is obviously non-existent for the most part.

But personally, for most people I recommend Three for £12.90, where they can speak to India for help and get someone who actually works there, which is marginally better. Or Tesco if you don't need unlimited anything. Or Maybe even T-Mobile's 'full monty' deal for £16/month, where they are at least upfront about you only ever getting 4mbit/sec at all times and everything actually is unlimited.",0,1394438865,null,0,false,0,cfyudl6,t3_1zynww,t1_cfyudl6,t3_1zynww,null,1432735128,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Salaries beginning with £20,000 are fairly average and not bad to live on and if your partner earns a similar amount I would say that's enough to raise a family on, many thousands of people are doing it. 

The job market I am not certain of but I would think there are both a lot of English teachers looking for jobs and a lot of positions available - just not necessarily in the right place.

Also, their 'unlimited' data craps out at 3.5gb, after that point they throttle you something cronic (384kbit/s downstream, 200kbit/s upstream). You can still download, so it's 'technically unlimited', but there are better deals out there for similar money or less which don't play silly games like that. It's better than it used to be, 1gb on their 'unlimited' plan and you simply got cut off.[2]

Oh, and Virgin's 'unlimited' texts, is actually 3,000. A lot, but not unlimited.[2]

Oh, and another thing, Virgin's 'unlimited' minutes... Guess what? 3,000 [2]

So, three counts of outright lying to their customers. Yes, it's in the t&amp;cs of the service, but if they advertise unlimited, then it should be unlimited. That's it. Simple as. If they were honest about it, and just said 3gb/3,000/3,000, then fine, whatever, but they very fact they outright lie to potential customers? No thanks, count me out for any amount of money.

So yeah, my advice is to avoid Virgin. I'm happy that you're happy enough with them to recommend them, but I personally wouldn't want to give any money to such shady business practices.

true,BaBaFiCo,null,null,"Hi there! I'm  22yo teacher in an English state secondary school in the Midlands, specialising in English and Film at GCSE and A-Level. 

A typical day: arrive at 7:30 and complete odd jobs and prepare for the day. Children arrive between 8:00-8:30 when lessons begin.  Lessons usually last an hour each with a 20 minute break between 10:00-11:00 and around an hour for lunch at some point between 12:00-1:00. 

Students typically go home between 3:00-3:30, after which there will be meetings or training for around an hour probably 2 out of 5 days each week. Most teachers either leave at this point or stay for another hour or so, depending on whether they prefer to work from home and family commitments. Most teachers will spend their evenings and weekends marking and planning as well. 

Private schools (often called public schools for confusion) are usually the reserve of the elite, taking students from wealthy middle class and upper class families. These schools have very high pass rates but will also have huge demands on their staff to keep the status quo. 

Public schools (called state schools) will have a much more diverse intake, though this will depend on the catchment area. An inner city school will have a high level of working class students and students from minorities and students who do not speak English as their first language. My school only has a handful of these students but is predominately working class with low aspirations as it is a former mining town in the Midlands. In public schools the pass rate can vary significantly and schools can range from being judged from outstanding to 'special measures' meaning they are subject to repeat inspections until they are deemed reliable again. State schools are subject to the whims of the (idiotic) Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove MP, and salary, hours etc are decided based upon government standards. 

There is a new class of schools becoming popular called Academies. These are former state schools that the government has effectively sold to corporate sponsors, who are then allowed to significantly change the routine and curriculum, can hire non qualified teachers and set their own salaries. These are still subject to independent audit and range from outstanding to terrible. 

Cultural you should have no problems. My school is in a working class town of ~40,000 and we have staff members from Canada, Australia and other far flung places and the students have no problems working with these people. As long as you have some knowledge of British culture, you'll be fine, as we have plenty of knowledge on yours. 

Vacation time, called holidays here, is 13 weeks a year. This is split into a large 6 week holiday in the summer, 2 weeks between every 12 week term, and a single week to divide the 12 week terms into blocks of 6. The 2 week holidays coincide with major holidays such as Christmas and Easter, though the exact dates are set at a County Council (state) level and all schools in your area should match. Teachers are not allowed to take vacation during term time and whilst illness is allowed, there is a culture of resentment in schools towards staff members who are often I'll (especially for problems such as stress, something I disagree with having had friends who suffer mental health issues). 

Salary in state schools is set at a national level. Starting salary is ~£22,000 outside of London and increases in yearly increments. After so many years you will join what is called the Upper Pay Scale which is again increased in a yearly fashion. There are also bonuses for those who take on responsibility and positions of leadership. Headteachers are paid on a separate scale. Closer to London and inside of London, teachers are paid on a different scale to account for the significant increase to the cost of living. More information on this can be found on www.tes.co.uk for the exact figures. 

The job market is good, and especially for English specialists. Whilst not as in demand as Chemistry and Maths teachers (who are so in demand that the government is giving out grants and incentives for those subjects) English is a subject where quality teachers are hard to come by in recent years and schools are not spoilt for choice when hiring. 

I hope I've answered all of your questions, but feel free to ask if you have any more. Also, the website www.tes.co.uk and the Education section of the major broadsheet newspapers should be good ports of call for more information.

What it effectively does is to add up every asset and every liability and to declare the countries with the biggest overall numbers as the winners, which is so ridiculous when you lay it out starkly like that that certainly any businessperson and really any half way sensible Jo(e) intuitively knows it's bullshit.  It tells us the truth perhaps, but not the whole truth (it ignores non-market elements of the economy like free software, community activities, and homelife, as well as issues like inequality) and not nothing but the truth (accidents, riots, disasters, pollution, crime, divorce, illness, people being forced to blow their savings, depletion of fossil fuels, etc. all count positively towards GDP).

There was an article in this weekend's FT, by Nigel Wilson, where he makes it clear what this recovery has really been about, and how we're still on the edge of a precipice:

""The winners and losers from QE are easy to identify.  For the wealthy, who live off assets rather than wages, this was a great recession.  The digital money created by central bankers went coursing around the world as investors searched for assets that would pay a decent yield, pumping up equity and bond markets.  British property prices are rising at a double digit rate.  

Wages, by contrast, failed to keep pace with inflation, and inequality widened.  Five years of interest rate repression has hurt savers, including retiring pensioners who typically put their assets into low-risk assets, where returns are now miniscule.  Asset price inflation has been particularly hard on younger, poorer people, who watch house prices rising beyond reach.

QE looks like a policy by the rich, for the rich; by politicians, for politicians.""",0,1394443633,null,0,false,0,cfyuywz,t3_20183g,t1_cfyuywz,t3_20183g,null,1432735407,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

true,Ukgamer66,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"Zero hour contracts can be useful for a small minority, but their current use should be outlawed. I used to work in retail, SO is a chef and many friends have suffered with this as well.

In EVERY case the employer has used the zero hour contract as a way to bully people, forcing people to work through booked holidays or ""next week might be quiet"", employing a large quantity of younger people in one go who all need training and sacrificing the hours of the experienced, reliable staff to do so etc. 

I worked with a guy who was fired who had said before the weekly rota was complete he had to finish for 5 on a Saturday to get to his other job, they forced him to stay until half past and then fired him, making him late to his other job where they then fired him for being late. 

People start fighting for the hours. You might think that this could be a good thing, getting people to work their hardest (a targets scheme with bonuses like approach) but instead the lazy ones go with underhanded tactics. My housemate got to work, grabbed his shirt out of his bag and then went to the toilet. When he came back the other three waiters on shift where gone (they had all started two weeks prior, first job) and his shirt had been slashed with a knife and some tomato sauce spilled on top for good measure. It takes 40 mins to get to work, so he had to get someone who lived nearer to cover. Two of those other waiters where caught drunk, stealing expensive wine at the end of that shift and fired on the spot. 

A few weeks ago we learned that getting a mortgage would be impossible until my SO found another job. Luckily she starts something bigger and better next week but she was having to consider moving from a job she loves, to looking at working in Tesco just to get a mortgage.

This. Hugo has never stopped trying no matter how many goals conceded. He just seems frustrated when 3/4 in defence stops playing after there is a unfair foul called or a goal conceded. 

I think we really need a new captain. Dawson is always great leading by example when the game is scoreless or we are leading but he is the first one to quit trying when we are losing. I'm thinking Walker should carry the band and was quite shocked that Jan took it after Daws was subbed against Chel$ea.

I loved last season Super-Jan, but this season he has just been a whiny little bitch whose face always looks like that little nerds who is forced to go to practice when he could be doing something else. 

Lennon has showed a big heart but this season he has been quite bad so far. It is like he is overdoing or -trying. His passes have been afwul and he just looks ridiculous trying to create pressure.

Someone also mentioned Paulinho. Here where I come from he has been nicknamed the ""jogging Brazilian"" and I think that is quite descriptive.




I really hope Tim gets a fair change as a manager with a fit team. To be honest he is suffering a lot from AVB's mistakes. I mean one guy is out and he has to start with Jan on the left? I want Disco-Benny back!

The DPA states that where data is collected, it may only be used for the purposes stated. If the employer doesn't state that they're to be using the data for background/credit checks (and Experian, incidentally, does offer credit checks as part of their background check service), then that puts them on very sketchy ground for carrying them out. There are several other potential violations of permissions breaches here as well, including that the employer might now hold data on the OP that he has not granted them permission to hold. 

On the point of the right to freely check anyone btw, if permission isn't required, it begs the question of why banks and contract service providers are so explicit about requring permission to perform a credit check. I've opened three bank accounts in the past few months, and each time, there were large and very wordy messages requiring me to click tickboxes to grant them my permission to perform a credit check. When I was in-branch applying for a mortgage, again, they were very explicit about requesting permission before launching a check.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt;  Walsall and Dudley as part of Birmingham because they are with the administrative boundary of the West Midlands

No, they are separate metropolitan boroughs, which makes them different cities. Until the Local Government Act 1985 you could have made the case that they were a single city by virtue of being part of the West Midlands metropolitan county, though in that case the city authority would have been West Midlands, not Birmingham. However, the metropolitan counties were abolished with the Local Government Act 1985 (edit: this is not strictly true - the metropolitain county *councils* were abolished; the counties themselves in theory exists, though in effect they have a purely ceremonial positions, with all powers stripped), and the powers devolved to the individual boroughs.

(EDIT: Corrected borough to county a few places in the paragraph above)

&gt; The city of London != the county of Greater London either.

""The city of London"" (edit: as distinct from the **C**ity of London) has no legal definition, and there is no such thing as ""the county of Greater London"".

The legal entities are Greater London, which superseded all other legal entities with any claim to the name London with the London Government Act 1963, and the ceremonial county of Greater London (ceremonial county != county - they have legally distinct definitions). The former explicitly covers the 32 London boroughs, nothing more, and nothing less. The latter consists of the London boroughs *excluding* City Of London. London has a legal status that is entirely distinct from all other types of UK metropolitan entities.

London Government Act 1963 has this to say about the administrative area ""Greater London:

&gt; 2.-(1) The area comprising the areas of the London boroughs,

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;The same can be said for medical personnel, lawyers, fire fighters, social services, the army and so on. But humans being human, that's not going to happen. 

But that's **self-evidently** wrong because these professions haven't existed for all of human history, these are at best facets of complex human societies. But the police force emerged in the 1830s, let’s not overdo their innateness to human societies. Human societies are ultimately under the control of humans, and if we so wanted, we could remove those institutions.

&gt;Even if we somehow eliminated poverty across the board, we wouldn't eliminate crime. We'd eliminate a lot of acquisitive crime (but by no means all) and some violent crime, but there would still be a need for someone to deal with what's left - domestic violence, random assaults, thefts &amp; frauds born out of pure unadulterated greed, public safety and so on.

Actually we'd get rid of about 90%. it would also require a re-evaluation of what crime was, most people are presently criminalised due to non-violent drug related offences, in that sense society very much creates crime. Of course there are those crimes which are the production of **over** material conditions apart from poverty. If you want to combat greed then combat the social notions which place, and emphasise, greed at the expense of all other human emotions. The centrality of greed to modern societies is by no means total, however it is necessarily a part of capitalism and it's need for consumers. Domestic violence is more likely if you are poor, reducing poverty at least reduces it, but other things such as liberating women from the objectification would go some way to undermine the social notion that women are there for men’s pleasures, which is no doubt part of the cause of domestic violence. As for random assaults, that too vague to pass judgement on, however if you take drunk related assaults they are also the product of particular material conditions that can be combatted, specifically the drudgery and monotony of work requires a leisure where we can forget. Not to mention the intersection of early closing times etc. As for greed, it's rare to find such people, usually those who steal through greed do so out of poverty, in the sense that their ability to steal learn through the necessity of survival replicates an ability to steal whenever, and as such they do.

The main role of the police force is to maintain the status quo. They are a product of capitalist societies and the class struggle contained within them.

You can abolish the police force but maintain a civil defence force. The difference being they are part of the community or society and not exterior or separate to it. They uphold the agree rules of a community without having any rights beyond those not members. A 'force' that is democratic, participatory, voluntary, informal, decentralised and always recallable and answerable to the community they 'defend'. Such 'forces' [exist all over Mexico](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XiSnCt9fDc) where the police force is allied to the drug cartels, they also usually emerge in the process of large social upheaval and uprising (Arab Spring etc.), which only proves humans are quite capable of creates effective defence squads. It's the state that creates police forces, it's minions, to maintain its hegemony and rule, at the expense of the people.

In the case of Westminster and the City of London this is merely a ceremonial recognition of their traditional status.

The list is accurate in listing areas with city status in the UK as conferred by the monarchs, but it has no significance in listing *cities* in common parlance.

This ""difficulty"" is entirely manufactured for all the bigger potential entrants. It becomes somewhat more relevant when you look at smaller towns vs. smaller cities, where there certainly are towns that have a much more natural claim on the title than many of the smallest cities, but in those cases there are usually no alternative basis for the claim (administrative forms etc.).

The bigger entities which most people would consider cities, on the other hand, clearly fall into a very specific set of two legal entities: Greater London, or a Metropolitan Borough. 

I suspect you'd cover all but some tiny edge-cases by taking Greater London and the Metropolitan Boroughs, and adding all entities with City status (optionally excluding those contained inside a bigger city - Westminster and City of London - though we're used to having countries within a country, so that's not really necessary...).

To be fair, if you grow up as a second generation immigrant, you're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Even though it's the only home you've ever known, there are plenty of people who'll say you don't really belong here. 

Your parents might send you mixed messages - maybe they want you to integrate better than they did, maybe they want you to hold onto your cultural traditions even though you have no experience of that culture. 

Your life will automatically be just that little bit more difficult than others just because your parents made a decision to relocate to a different country - you had no choice in that.

In the workplace you have a manager - if the project fucks up, yeah sure the workers take some blame, but ultimately the manager does too - especially if they can be criticised for trying to work understaffed etc. (badly calculating this is what leads to such a great market for contractors to come in and help finish something right before the deadline)

Whereas in academia it's all on you. If you don't get the papers published, you suffer. There are no fixed working hours. You work as much as you need to, to get it done. And you can never be sure the review board will like your paper, or the funding bodies grant your proposal etc. Post-docs last 1-2 years and it's hard to get a permanent position so you are constantly looking for a new position and moving all over the world, leaving family and friends behind to do so for a far smaller salary than at least numerate researchers can get in industry.

The best comparison I can think  of would be if all work was paid on a commission basis or a tiny fraction of the profits - so you were never sure if your work would actually pay off, and the jobs only lasted a few months at a time.

I haven't seen the Nuremburg defence in a while. 

&gt;99% of them had nothing to do with

But they do have something to do with it. [Metropolitan police still institutionally racist, say black and Asian officers](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/21/metropolitan-police-institutionally-racist-black). Even their own officers recognise it, but of course we ignore them just as we ignore the near total historic condemnation of the police by black and 'minority' people. Because if 1000 people had died in police custody since 1993, without a single conviction (last conviction for a death was 1969, and that was on a minor charge), and if the majority had been white, they would be an uproar. Even when judges find police officers guilty of perverting the course of justice and hiding and lying about murders, and contempt of court, they are never put on trial by their own, the CPS. 

As I said, if you want to deal with the police you cannot deal with them in the abstract, they are not separate from other social forces and conditions, they are intimately linked. Truly dealing with the police force requires a questioning not only of our laws on drugs, but questioning our whole socio-economic and political system. But those meaningful questions aren't asked by the relevant people because the relevant people don't want a solution, they want stability and continuity, most options are closed before an investigation into changes can ever be made. The people who are the effect of changes aren't the ones making them. The police are their to maintain order and the status quo, catching criminals is at best a marginal issue for the sake of appearance (but obviously the ideology of the police force is believing by those in it, and those white people who are believe they are being protected by it). We are yet to ask the right questions, at present we are solving the wrong questions which leads to the same problems over and over again, the same goes for the riots, we never take a radical approach (radical meaning 'getting to the root of a problem')

Some pay rises have been obscene. As an example:

&gt; [Among those picking up improved deals last year was the outgoing president and provost of University College London, Sir Malcolm Grant, who received **a £41,077 increase in his pay and pensions package** to £365,432, despite having spent only three days a week at UCL after taking the chair of NHS England.](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/big-pay-rises-for-russell-group-chiefs-in-9k-fees-era/2010075.article)

Meanwhile:

&gt;[UCEA has advised Higher Education institutions to proceed with **a one per cent pay increase** for staff. ](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/staff/staff-news/0114/16012014-nationalpayward20132014)

As for the working as an academic, I am in agreement. Based on my own experiences, it is likely that academia is generally not as many on the outside perceive it:

* Remuneration for research-grade positions is generally rather low. I've seen starting wages as low as £26k for post-doc posts. A particularly prestigious Russell Group university is notably stingy in its pay scales, presumably because of the high demand owing to the prestige of the institution. As others have stated, higher pay is largely specific to teaching posts, or advancement into management, despite those in research positions also being contractually obliged to undertake teaching themselves. Typically, the higher you get, the less time you have to actually do the very thing you signed up for: research.

* The onus of research positions has shifted from exploratory research, the testing of novel hypotheses or methods, the discovery of clinically- or policy-relevant associations, and the translation of important findings into real-world applications. The focus now sits squarely with: (a) achieving as many publications as possible in high-impact journals, so as to bump the institution's REF; (b) win grants. The focus therefore sits less with content and more with the ability of researchers to bring in money and improve the reputation of the institution via a woefully flawed rating system. This has only escalated in recent years owing to reduced funding opportunities.

* The nature of projects being grant funded is such that they are temporary and short-term, operating until funds run dry (usually 1-5 years). This means that, for the most part, researchers have to either win grant funding themselves (difficult as a junior researcher, as those with the funds are looking for big names and a proven history of success), or follow the money won by more senior researchers in the field. This can mean travelling around the country, moving from one-year position in Cardiff to a three-year job in Edinburgh, and so on.

* The hours can be incredibly long. It is not uncommon to start work at 0800 in the morning, and still be trudging along gone midnight. Weekends frequently disappear and six-day weeks are increasingly the norm. A few researchers I know do considerable amounts of extra work yet receive no extra pay. They feel compelled to do so due to pressures from above and increasing competition for positions. Although there are holiday entitlements, as with any job, the decision to take time off is complicated by the knowledge of just how much extra work will await you upon your return. Speaking personally, despite the odd day or two here and there, I've only taken out a block of 5+ days once since 2008.",0,1394452671,null,0,1394453211,0,cfywegu,t3_1zzhkd,t1_cfywegu,t1_cfyglfu,null,1432736160,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Three do a decent deal on unlimited for £12.90/month:
http://store.three.co.uk/view/searchSimOnly?tariff=29150100&amp;intid=3storephrbn1376
I used that for a while, really fast data at a good price. You'll get 4G thrown in as well if your phone supports it and there is signal.

If Three is a no-go for signal, then T-Mobile do properly unlimited everything for £16/month right now. Speed is capped at 4mbit/sec all the time, but that'll be plenty for the vast majority of stuff. So unless you REALLY want 4G speeds, they are a good option. If you're streaming in the car, you won't notice.

Also, see here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjKnq7RtRv_sdDEyTkdIN1FCZ1RZUjdJTUdUV294bFE&amp;usp=sharing
But do your own research as well. For me, for example, I am able to get 2gb/750mins/5000text for £10 with Tesco mobile as I know someone who works for Tesco and can get me on the staff policy (totally legit, they actually encourage this). So see if things like that are an option for you.

Figure out what you ACTUALLY USE. Don't just think ""I need it to be unlimited"". Take sensible precautions before you go out. For example, I have Pocket Cast download my podcasts overnight, I use Google Play Music, but ""pin"" songs to my device before I leave, I use Sygic for GPS (though Google maps isn't too bad on data), Google Play updates my apps on Wifi only etc. etc. When I was on Three, I was using 6-8 gigabytes per month, just because I could. Now I'm on GiffGaff, the last two months I have just been sensible, and am well under 2gb a month and I'm not caring about it, so I'll be switching to Tesco when my goodybag expires, and I won't notice the difference except a slight saving and better data speeds.

Oh, buy cheap sims, for like a £1 on a few networks. Just to test the signal where you'll be using it the most. That way you aren't trapped with no signal when you choose one.

Sim-Only is the utter best way to go for the vast majority of people, even if you want to upgrade your phone. You get the freedom to ditch and switch if a network becomes crap or a better deal comes along, and you outright own your phone without any carrier bloatware bullshit. Utter bliss. With game-changing phones like the Moto G around, there really isn't a reason to go on contract these days. Even a couple of my Apple fanboi owning friends are ditching and going Android+Sim only and not looking back.

Even if you buy a high-end phone/iPhone it's still usually better value for money with a sim-only contract. You get much more for the same money, or the same for less money. And with the freedom to move.

The government insures £85k per financial institute. Not per bank which can catch a few people out.

The grouping is nice and confusing too. 

For example, sister banks Halifax and Bank of Scotland's accounts are only covered up to £85k combined. RBS and NatWest are also sisters, but their £85k limits are SEPARATE. So you are covered for £85k in one and £85 in the other.

The confusion seems to come from when banks ""merge"" or get fully taken over, get sold etc. The only way to know is to actually check, you can't assume one bank is its own institute or not (as shown in my examples above).",0,1394456474,null,0,false,0,cfyx81g,t3_201a68,t1_cfyx81g,t1_cfyw6yh,null,1432736549,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

His shot stopping is world class and that is the most difficult aspect of goalkeeping to improve in my opinion. I just don't see what other options are out there. And our defense in front of him has been ever-changing, unstable and on the whole quite poor.

The only guy I can think of is begovic and to be honest, it would really be a lateral move. There's no guarantee he could handle the pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. I jus don't get who you would want and how you'd want pepe back after he has been so poor for a few seasons.

I've stated numerous times that his (migs) control of the box and distribution can be worked on. Hell, if he even just becomes great at dominating his area stuff the distribution.

If the guy really wants first-team football every week, then I can't see him staying at Anfield, but if he's happy to be a squad player then I think he'd be very useful to us. Assuming that Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling all start we really don't have anyone who we can bring off the bench in games at the moment who might change the dynamic up front and score a goal. I think Borini would give us an option there, and if we have attacking midfield injuries then he gives us cover there too, as we can drop Suarez further back and play him up front with Sturridge. 

I doubt he's on massive wages, and I also don't see us signing a new striker this summer, so I'd feel it's worth keeping him, and allowing players like Jordan Ibe to be out on loan getting proper regular first-team experience.

Recently there was a survey by Ofcom and this was their finding:

&gt; When 3G mobile spectrum licences were awarded in 2000, they included an obligation to roll-out services to 80% of the UK by population. However, in 2010 the Government directed Ofcom to increase this obligation further, requiring operators to cover 90% of where the UK population lives.

&gt;**EE, Three, O2 and Vodafone agreed to reach this new coverage obligation by a deadline of 30 June 2013.**
Once this deadline had passed, Ofcom conducted an assessment of each operator’s compliance with the new coverage obligation. The outcome of this reveals that the mobile phone operators – EE, Three and O2 – have successfully met this obligation.

&gt; **However, one operator, Vodafone, failed to meet the obligation, falling 1.4% short of the 90% coverage requirement.**

So 90% of residences have 3G on Three, comparable to the others and better than Vodafone. [Source](http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2013/11/07/ensuring-3g-coverage-compliance/)",0,1394459305,null,0,false,0,cfyy02h,t3_2015k2,t1_cfyy02h,t1_cfyxqjm,null,1432736914,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

 Liverpool and Man Utd (44k in Scandinavia) have huge followings in Norway, personally I never had a father or older brother that cared for football and I found it a bit silly to choose one on at random.  

I've got some distant contacts on facebook that even report Tranmere results on their feed every damn round. Personally I just chose East Fyfe in the old, old CM/football manager games out of spite (yeah, they're even Scottish) and list that as my favourite club all over the place if I'm asked, unless I'm allowed to put ""yes"" there instead. I also buy the odd eastern European jersey every chance I get, to wear it when all others have their PL jerseys on.

It's cool with OGS and the Norwegians, but I'm not sure if he's doing it right or overdoing it. He desperately wants to do a Fergie style managment from day one, I fear it could go like the first PL manager we had ,Ståle Solbakken, who got a few weeks at Wolverhampton and shuffled things around a bit too fast, perhaps. Then again Fergie was one loss away from getting sacked too, didn't he?

By far the most impact a Norwegian must have done in the PL is not OGS, but two billionaires that bought Wimbledon and moved it to Milton Keynes due to the ""lack of a big club in such a well populated area"".

What is banned is assisted suicide.  There are two main concerns, really.  One is that it might lead to people getting away with murder or people being coerced into suicide (though if we insist on therapy sessions and a formal written statement beforehand that shouldn't be a problem, and obviously restricting it to people with terminal illnesses reduces the risks too).  The other is that certain religions feel very strongly about suicide.

I think Lamela, with a full preseason and fitness, would have a wonderful pairing with Eriksen. Townsend on the left just needs to happen. I'm fairly confident that Lamela will be a better inverted winger with his decision making and shooting/passing ability. 


As far as Chiriches going into the starting line-up, I'm more than okay with it. I love Jan, but the way he's been acting lately towards the club and teammates during matches isn't leaving a good impression on most of the fans I've seen on here and I have to say I feel the same way. I feel Caulker can possibly oust Kaboul, given time. Granted, I didn't see the Chelsea game entirely so I may have missed something. I'm pretty sure I remember reading somewhere that we have first refusal should Caulker be sold or want to move, and he deserves to be in the PL.

I hope Lloris stays, that doesn't even really need an elaboration, we need him.


I'm really looking forward to the return of the Sandro-Dembele partnership someday. One of the absolute best in Europe before Beast's injury. Combine that partnership with Eriksen's creativity, workrate, and off the ball intelligence it will be a midfield to be reckoned with.

The Ade and Soldado partnership has been working fairly well and I think it will get better. Bobby will most likely start popping goals in soon enough, and when he does I think their partnership can be one of the best. Both can pass well and find each other and have done so on more than one occasion. Both can also bring others into play fairly well.

Anyway, that's my two cents, not that it's worth that much, not that it's even an accurate assessment but I feel that your lineup with the occasional switch to utilize Ade and Soldado is probably the best and a pretty terrifying one at that.

Lots of reasons. One is that it's better connected to the rest of the country making it the most convenient place to govern the rest of the country. It's also better connected to the rest of the world than any other city.

You posted this:
&gt;I think we buy a left back in the window. Rose has made it perfectly clear that he wants to start, so I think that results in his sale to a middle table club.

however Rose has been first choice for games that he's been fit for and has performed very well for us until petty people here turned on him just for making one mistake in the NLD.

If de Boer comes, here's what I see: 

--------------------Lloris(hopefully)----------------------

Walker---Chiriches/(Alderweireld)* ---Vertonghen---Transfer**

--------------Sandro---------Dembele----------------

----Lamela-----------Eriksen------------Transfer***

---------------------Soldado------------------------------

Bench: Gomes?, Adebayor, Holtby, Townsend, Chirches/Alderweireld, Fryers, Paulinho

*If Alderwiereld is signed, de Boer is most likely going to prefer him to Chiriches. 

**Rose sucks and has shown that LB is a position we certainly need to reinforce. Fryers is good, but I don't know if he'll have the manager's trust to take up that position. 

***I don't trust Townsend to take over a starting position. I think someone needs to be bought here. I'm thinking Jay Rodriguez from Southampton or Griezmann from Real Sociedad. Either of those signings would be huge. 

I think it would be foolish to give up on Lamela so soon. He would be eager to play for us if he was given the attention and playing time he deserves. An Eriksen-Lamela partnership would work wonders for both of them. Lamela is the 2nd creative player we need.

But anyway, this is all very optimistic and depends on us signing Frank de Boer. Let me know what you all think.

I think you'd need to think carefully about what kind of food and snacks you'd sell, because I expect you'll have to have either a minimum spend or a high-ish delivery fee and, if I only *need* one or two things, I want some decent choices of stuff to make it worthwhile ordering instead of going out.

Would you only deliver products you have to hand, or is this a general service I'd call up and give you a list of things you then go and find for me? If the latter, would you go and pick up a takeaway for me from a place which doesn't deliver, in addition to the standard items I order? Will you be open later than local basics convenience stores (of the non 24 hour sort)?

I'm sorry if those sound like stupid questions, but I've never heard of a service like this before, only wished for it, so I'm not sure what is and isn't an option, and I can't decide whether or not I'd use a service until I know its benefits and limitations. Actually, what I've wished for is that ordinary takeaways offered basic grocery/home items in addition to their menu, hence the question about picking up food.

Anyway, if I were to use the service, here are some things I remember wishing I could have delivered by a service like this: 

* shower gel
* shampoo
* conditioner
* toothpaste 
* toilet paper 
* kitchen roll
* non-fizzy soft drinks like fruit juice in addition to regular sodas (I can get soda from any takeaway, but not usually fruit juice)
* alcohol
* crisps, nuts, pork scratchings
* aspirin, berocca, vitamins (things people with a hangover want but don't want to go out for)
* bread, milk, butter, eggs, basic cheddar cheese, cereal - and any other common staples which people often have to ""pop out to the shops"" for between weekly big grocery shops.
* new, really basic, really plain and cheap underwear (I know that sounds weird, but the amount of times I've been about to go on a night out and realised I'm out of clean socks is absurd. You'd think I'd learn, but apparently not).

Here's how I'd like to see us play next season. If we want Champions League, we *need* to bring in someone who isn't Rose. He's 23 and while he isn't shit, he makes far too many mistakes. If he was a few years younger, I'd suggest we bring in an older, more experienced player to teach him some tricks, but let's face it. He's the same age as Walker and nowhere near as good. 

I'd still suggest reinforcing with an older player who might be on his way out from a top club. I think Zeki Fryers has been solid so far and I'm looking forward to seeing what he might become in the future, but he's still not quite there yet. Europa League + occasional Premier League against teams in the lower half would do him good.

Dawson is definitely on his way out and if Kaboul can keep fit, I think he should be first team. His display against Newcastle was absolutely amazing. As far as individual skill goes, I think Vertonghen + Kaboul is our best combination of centre backs. That said, Dawson's influence on the team shouldn't be underestimated and he should definitely be kept around, as should Chiriches. I'm looking forward to see how Chiriches will perform in a few years. Walker is a nobrainer.

Dembele and the Beast screening the backline and recycling balls with Eriksen popping them into the box. During the attack, Dembele could move up beside Eriksen while Sandro occupies the space between them. Further, I think Townsend has potential to be very good - not the new Bale by any means, but still a very solid winger. He just needs to learn how to pick out his passes instead of just going for fruitless shots that end up in the stands. 

If Lamela can just get into things, I have no doubt that he'll be a brilliant, brilliant player. I don't think we should get rid of him. As soon as he's fit, I think he should be on the pitch instead of Lennon, simply because Lennon hasn't shown very much of anything the past weeks. There's no way Lamela can adapt to the Premier League without spending time on the pitch.

Then there's Ade. From the interviews he seems to really enjoy life at the club and he's definitely got more to give. I think he enjoys the responsibility he has been given under Sherwood and so far he's really been amazing all over the pitch. I want to see him spearhead every attack and to make it official, I think he should be considered for the armband.

&gt;

&gt;__Commonwealth Day__ is the annual celebration of the [Commonwealth of Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) held on the second Monday in March, and marked by a multi-faith service in [Westminster Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey), normally attended by HM Queen [Elizabeth II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II), [Head of the Commonwealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth), with the Commonwealth Secretary-General and Commonwealth [High Commissioners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner) in London. The Queen delivers an address to the Commonwealth, broadcast throughout the world. 

&gt;In the year before the quadrennial [Commonwealth Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games), the Queen starts the [Queen's Baton Relay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Baton_Relay) on Commonwealth Day at [Buckingham Palace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace), handing the baton to the first relay runner to start a journey that will end at the Opening Ceremony of the upcoming Games.

&gt;While it has a certain official status, Commonwealth Day is not a public holiday in most Commonwealth countries and there is little public awareness of it.

I've attended one North London Derby, we beat them 2-1 at home and it was incredible. I've also been to see use lose, to Chelsea on Saturday, Wolves at Home, Everton Away, Villa at Home and more than i can care to remember. The fact is, Sunday's game is going to be difficult. We are in disarray, against a good Arsenal team who will probably have just been dumped out of the Champions League with a point to prove. However, if I could get tickets, I would. Why? Because there is no greater feeling than the anticipation before the game, running scenarios through your head, praying to and bargaining with whatever god you believe in for a last minute winner, to keep it at 0-0 or to get that second to secure the win. If you're a true supporter of the club you'd be there through thick and thin, and pray for victory at the final whistle.

Anyway, i've drifted on a tangent somewhat so i'll answer your actual question. You'll be very lucky to get one, and to be honest you'll pay top dollar for it. Not being a One Hotspur Member isn't a problem - you can become one with a half season membership for £20, and then (although i hate it) StubHub is probably your best bet. Scalping tickets on the day will cost you, and you'll potentially get arrested as it's illegal and the guys are very untrustworthy.

My advice would be find a good pub nearby (The Bill Nicholson springs to mind), and go there. Enjoy the atmosphere with other spurs fans, sing some songs, have a few pints. Just remember, form goes out the window in derby games, and winning this years NLD promises a lot to both sides. 

I really hope you can make at least the pub, if not the ground, no one should ever tell you to head back to LA.

I remember watching the 2008 final in Moscow and seeing the heartbreak on Terry's face when he missed the PK and thinking, ""wow, there's a man who's just had his dreams shattered"" and he instantly won my respect for his love for his club. 

Fast forward one year and I was studying for six months in London. My flat was about a mile from the Bridge. Out of curiosity one day, a friend and myself went down to Fulham Broadway to check out the atmosphere on match day.  It was the Stoke-CFC match at the Bridge.  Standing outside the stadium at half time, I encountered a disgruntled fan who was leaving and he handed me his ticket. I walked to the ticket scanner, scanned the barcode, and managed to walk in, sitting in the Blues' scoring end. Stoke scored in the 60th, and there was a general feel of despair in the crowd (this was during the dark days of Scolari's managing). But, being the class act that he is, SuperFrank put one in in the 88th minute, and then again in stoppage time. That's the exact moment Lamps became my favorite player to watch, and he is still my favorite CFC player.  The uproar from the crowd, the jolly chanting after the match, the general atmosphere around the Bridge made me fall in love with the club. I threw myself into the sport and learned everything I could about it. I went down to the local pubs (the Slug and Brogans!) for every match and fell in love with the culture. It was with utter anguish and a heavy heart that I watched (at Brogans) Barce beat CFC in the Champions League semis at the Bridge.

Lloris

Walker - Kaboul - Vert - Transfer

Sandro - Mousa

Lamela - Eriksen - Townsend

Ade

Rotation/Bench: Transfer GK, Naughton, Vlad, Daws, Zeki, Transfer DM, Carroll, Bentaleb, Holtby, Chadli, Lennon, Kane, Soldado, Transfer ST.

Keeper: Hugo I obviously think and hope will stay.  I love our sweeper keeper.  I think Gomes will go somewhere he'll actually see the pitch, and I hope Big Brad retires, but sticks around to coach.  

Centerbacks:  I'm not sold on Vert leaving.  If we bring in someone like Van Gaal, I think he gives it a year.  Kaboul, when healthy, is our best CB in my opinion.  It's not a guarantee, but it is what I hope to see.  Rotate Vlad and Daws in for cups and rest.  Send Milos Veljkovic out on loan, get him some first team minutes.

Fullbacks: Danny Rose is a quesiton mark for me.  I certainly think we can improve on him, but he won't be a backup.  Because of that, I wouldn't be surprised to see him go.  I love Zeki and Naughton as our backups, and I think Naughton has shown he's a more than capable rotation option.  Walker is a fucking boss, nothign else to say there.

DM: Sandro will start forever and always.  I don't think Capoue is all that inclined to stay, and I'd love to see us bring in another capable holding mid so we don't end up with a situation like we had last year.  If Van Gaal comes in, he'll likely look to buy a DM with some good passing ability, or try to groom Bentaleb for that role.  He's a great passer, and has shown some impressive strength.  If his positioning and decision making improve, he could do well as a holding mid, especially for Van Gaal.

CM: Mousa/Sandro pairing is still our best in my opinion.  Rotate in Tommy fucking Carroll and Paulinho and we're good.  I think Pauly is better than he's shown lately, and Carroll could get some solid minutes if we don't want to loan him out again.  Bentaleb and Holtby are also candidates here in my opinion.

AMC: Eriksen is going to be even more amazing, and we need to be building this team around him.  I think Holtby is also an option to get some minutes here.  Gylfi will probably be sold, unfortunately.  We just can't get him on the pitch most of the time, which is very disappointing.  

Wingers: Lamela is insanely talented, and hopefully will be leading our attack with Eriksen for many years to come.  I wish he'd stayed healthy, because I think Timmy would play him in an instant.  Lennon is a good variety option off the bench, pace for days.  Just don't play him on the left please.  And speaking of the left, I think Townsend will be our best option there for next year.  I want to see Chadli playing right now, but that's only because Townsend's head doesn't seem right.  He's not as confident as he was, and seems hesitant at times.  I'm not too worried about the shooting, it's only been an issue for one half hour period on the left.  Chadli will hopefully stick around, I think he's a very disciplined player in terms of sticking to his role on that left side, and is a threat to either shoot or cross.  Also very strong, which is good for a different option on the flank.

Strikers:  I'm a huge fan of both of them.  I've been talking up Ade since we brought him on permanently, and I haven't lost faith in Soldado.  I think they'll be very effective either together or in a rotation next year.  As for hopefully bringing in a transfer, I'd like to see us go young.  Bring in a guy who isn't quite there yet, but has the potential to be.  Soldado and Ade are getting up there in age, and I'd like to see us look to the future.

true,Crypt0Nihilist,null,null,"It's hard to imagine that someone does bring that much value to the company. Often it's people doing the same thing, but with higher stakes. Could someone do the same or better job for less money? I should think so. After all, they were doing those jobs for 50% less money until recently.

I think of it waiters at a classy restaurant. Two waiters might serve two tables ordering identical food, but one table orders £200 of wine and the other orders £3000. Has the second waiter added £280 of value? Did he pour the wine significantly better than his colleague, with whom his fortunes could easily have been reversed? No. He's simply taking a cut of a larger pie. His reward has been divorced from the value he adds and hitched to wealth at hand. 

There is a case to be made that he is handling more valuable assets and deserves extra compensation for doing so successfully ie he is carrying expensive wine and dropping it would be expensive. However, the kind of differential in tip still seems vastly disproportionate even once you take such an uplift into consideration.

The same goes for top management teams. You get to a point where having another few zeros on the figures you're dealing with makes little difference to what you can or can't do. Investment bankers started the trend of convincing their firms to use their salaries as a marketing tool ""We must be the best because we pay the best!"" and the con has swept across industry from there.

2. Enrique isn't god's gift to the left back position anyway. He's a good player, but it's still an area we can look to improve on; hence, sign a new first-choice LB instead of a backup.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; Secondly, what's more important is a matter of perspective.

No, banking is important to our economy, and a working economy is very important in general terms to our well being.

 But ultimately someone who is saving lives, and conducting research to improve our medical knowledge to save even more lives in the future is more important. This is not a controversial opinion.  

Because  even in a non functioning economy a doctor still has a use.

&gt; Thirdly, you cannot just claim that the terrible NHS service is because of poorly paid consultants. 

Good job I never did then eh?  

The argument is simple. We pay the best to get the best. Therefore if banking pays more than doctoring, the best will be attracted to banking rather than medicine.  If we accept the current wisdom that attempts to justify high salaries and bonuses, it is logical to assume the best choosing their careers at 17 will decide to be bankers.

That leaves the second best to follow the second best paid job - medicine. Now they may well be  still brilliant, but, if we accept that ""pay the best to get the best"" is a fact and not just a trite phrase they logically can't be the best from our talent pool.

Therefore society is harmed because the best are busy generating complex financial instruments that no-one but them understands, rather than curing cancer.

Sure, the second best may well eventually cure cancer, but not as quickly, because they aren't brightest minds we have available.

Now if the best minds were curing cancer, and the second best were building financial instruments, would we be better or worse off as a society?  It's not unreasonable to believe we would be better off, therefore we should ensure that career average earnings of consultants is higher than the career average earnings of the financial and legal professions.

Everyone's feeling very resigned and frankly, fucking beat up. This season has been fucked from the moment we got savaged by city and then Liverpool. We are all looking forward to next season because this one seems like such a write off. But fifth and a reasonable cup run in the Europa is basically what we did last season. 

I think we all want to close our eyes and open them to see a settled team with someone like Van Gaal at the head, leading us into a new season. He'll have players that we like who he doesn't like. I would guess Rose and Townsend are going to have the most to prove to him. 

I don't like Chadli, I don't think he's good enough. Lamela is going to play a big part next season, I think anyone who comes in will be heavily encouraged to work with him. Soldado is going to stay unless Levy can get most of the money we spent back (which won't happen). I'd encourage Capoue to stay, because he's our most natural DM after the injury-plagued Sandro. I personally love Chiriches, despite his agent's silly comments about Chelsea when we bought him. Aside from a couple of lapses I think he's been a good buy. I'd have Paulinho stay, simply because I think he'll be like Ramires for Chelsea. He was poor for a long time as far as I recall, and came good. 

Buys for the summer, I think the only must is a LB, and a CB depending on Kaboul's situation. But like I say, we don't know how Van Gaal will feel.",0,1394467906,null,0,false,0,cfz196w,t3_201ppa,t1_cfz196w,t3_201ppa,null,1432738492,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

But that's irrelevant. Boil it down to basics.

Imagine a world without an economy.  Say an EMP fries every computer wiping all banking records worldwide.   Who has more use to that society?  A nurse or a banker? Sure, it would be a shit existence without an economy but ultimately the nurse is far more important to society.

An economy is nice to have, an economy pays for medical research and bandages. But the economy would function without bankers. We'd see more bartering, more mutuals providing local funding.  It may not be as efficient, but it would work. We may not get a new iphone every 2 years, but we'd cope.

Bankers have never been, and never will be more important than nurses. They add value, and the world would be worse without them, but the world would be fucking a disaster if we didn't have competent medical staff.

- Siggurdsson isn't a left winger, and if he wants to be a 10, then he needs to prove that he is substantially better than Holtby.  I sort of wish he was at Fullham right now because next year he'll be 25 and getting a little old to be out on loan hoping for a future return.  Holtby as Eriksen's backup, Chadli as Townsend's backup, Sigurdsson loan or sell.

- Rose can leave...on loan.  I'm not ready to give up on him at 23.  His speed and abilities moving forward make him attractive, and I'd give him 2-3 more years to come along as a defender before I totally give up on him.

Walker - Kaboul/Dawson - Vlad the Impaler - Transfer/Rose

Lennon - Dembele - Sandro - Lamela

Eriksen

Adebayor/Soldado

Bench: Townsend, Fryers, Dawson/Kaboul, Bentaleb, Chadli, Transfer GK, Soldado/Ade

Mentions: LB transfer/Rose, and Holtby, also Paulinho.  They give us depth, and when the team is coordinated and thinking as one unit, Paulinho is devastating.  Too bad we've only seen that once or twice.

I don't rate Townsend.  Sorry.  He's not team-oriented enough, and all I read from him is ""cocky"".  He needs to get knocked back a peg, and I think that will happen this summer in Brazil.  He can fill in for Lennon after 60', IMO.  Fryers is growing into his own, and I think Chadli and Capoue have a lot of value in their flexibility.  I was a big fan of Jan, but lately, I'm really put off by his attitude - and I'm not talking about interviews and shit, his attitude on the pitch has been abysmal.  He's an unhappy guy because it hasn't been going well, and he's dragging people down with him, it's toxic.  He's making the same faces and gestures at his *teammates* that he used to direct at opponents.

I do keep Dawson in my first 11 or on the bench.  He's the captain for a reason, and though he's not the speediest guy out there, he provides leadership and stability.  If you go and change the 4 in front of Lloris every week, then there's not much synchronicity.  But, I really do like how well Kaboul plays when he's fit.

I put one striker up top, because I remember VdV being really effective in that CF position as a second striker, and I think Eriksen has that quality.  Look at where Ade and Bobby drop back to, when we're on a buildup.  Backed up with a box-box CM and fast wingers, we can press an attack, and Sandro hanging around between the center circle and the arc can collect any loose balls and redistribute.

I don't think Hugo is going anywhere yet.  He's had a few too many moments of breakdown, and that will put off clubs ranking higher than Spurs.  Historically, the best keepers in the world don't collapse when the scoreline stacks against them, but lately Lloris looks pained and unmotivated when we're falling behind.  I also think Jan's attitude will slow any transfer possibilities.

I don't think we're going to lose too many players over the summer, and I also don't think we're going to be buying too many, either.  The squad is so unsettled as it is, putting 8 new people in the roster will ruin the 14/15 season too.  I'd LOVE to see BAE come back, and I'm sure Ade would feel the same.  He injects some much needed mirth and experience, besides, I think he'd rather play here than QPR.",0,1394469347,null,0,false,0,cfz1w6g,t3_201ppa,t1_cfz1w6g,t3_201ppa,null,1432738787,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,tjcefc,null,null,"Very, very good question. It is a difficult one as there is a lot of promising youth around the age group of 17-21. The problem of course, is that it is so hard to really know who will make it and who wont. I would suggest the first place to start is with the loanees. One would assume those who have been sent out on loan this season are the ones who are the highest up the pecking order in their age group. Shane Duffy has been on loan at Yeovil but due to John Stones and the emergence of Tyias Browning I cant imagine he is going to make it at Everton to be perfectly honest. Tyias Browning spent a month on loan at Wigan but I don't think he made many appearances. He is somebody I think could well break into the first team squad next season. Indeed, he has been on the bench for the last couple of games and based on what Roberto said about him in the followtonians podcast (something along the lines of he is pretty much ready to join the first team) I imagine he is somebody who we could see a bit more next season (although he may go out on loan at some point as well). John Lundstram has been on loan at Yeovil like Duffy. He is a defensive midfielder who has a decent range of passing from what I have heard. He has represented England at youth level and has played frequently whilst on loan at Yeovil. He could well break into the first team squad next season. 
Conor McAleny was loaned out to Brentford earlier this season but unfortunately broke his leg and is only just coming back to full fitness now. Chris Long was loaned to MK Dons for a month in January and is now back with the club. He is also a striker who is promising and has represented england at youth level. Matthew Kennedy was loaned to Tranmere earlier this season and he is supposedly a very talented winger so we may see a little bit of him. Matthew Pennington was also loaned to local club Tranmere and is a CB/RB but given the competition at CB I'm not sure we will be seeing much of him next season. Then you have a few lads from the U18s who look as though they have promising futures ahead; George Green is probably the most high profile of these and he is definitely somebody I think will be playing for the Everton first team one day. He is exceptionally talented and can play on the wing/in the hole. Whether we see him next season remains to be seen, he might end of going on loan for some part of next season to accelerate his development. Then there is Ryan Ledson who is also extremely promising. He is the captain of the England U17s and has been promoted to the Everton U21 team for much of this season. Next season may come too soon for him as he is only 17. Courtney Duffus is a promising striker from the U18 team who, like Ledson has been playing quite a lot for the U21 this season. I think he is 18 and from what I have seen he looks very promising. He is another who may find himself on loan for a period of next season. 

It is incredibly difficult to predict how these players will turn out. They all have a lot of potential but there are an insane number of influential factors that determine whether somebody makes it at the highest level so the only way to really know is to wait and find out! No question there is a lot be excited about though!

If I had to rank who I think is most likely to see some first team action next season I would probably go with this:
-Lundstram
-Browning
-Kennedy
-McAleny
-Green
-Duffus
-Ledson
-Duffy

true,MrPoletski,uk,Essex Boi,"&gt; Many many multi-million pound companies are still run by their creator. There are well over quarter of a million millionaires in the UK, and many of them run or previously ran a very successful company of their own to get to that position.

Yeah, but what is their actual wage payments for being the CEO of those companies?
 

&gt; The problem with capping upper management wages in the way you mention is that it would cause rapid inflationary pressure. The head of goldman sachs, in order to get his £1m pay packet, could very well start paying his cleaners £100 per hour.

They would not be able to afford to do that, so the CEO could not be paid that high.


&gt;But then what happens to other companies? They need to compete with that. So they either increase their wage or they don't and can't get the staff.

Academic, there are a LOT more lower paid staff than higher paid staff. An alternative method might be that no individuals pay packet can be more than a given percentage of the entire payroll funds.

&gt;If the wage increases, then inflation increases across the board, unvalidating any increase in wages among the lower workers you achieved.

Inflation increases? what? explain to me how this would affect inflation.


&gt;If they go out of business then you've cut off your nose to spite your face. 

I don't think a company is going to drive itself out of business just so the CEO can get a massive wage.

true,glguru,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; But ultimately someone who is saving lives, and conducting research to improve our medical knowledge to save even more lives in the future is more important. This is not a controversial opinion. 

This is your opinion. The fact of the matter is that we're living in times where our quality of life is significantly better than our ancestors and business and commerce have played a big role in this. Not to mention that the commercial aspect of medicine has led to great advances in medical science. Yes, when Glaxo sets up a new research factory that saves thousands of lives, they take a loan from the bank. It would be a virtually impossible undertaking just for the stake holders to risk themselves with, even if they can afford it. This is true for practically every business ranging from the corner pharmacy to perhaps your local surgery. Most people grossly underestimate the role of banking in the quality of our modern day lives.

Secondly, there is absolutely no proof that the field of medicine is suffering because of bankers. I do not understand how you can just casually correlate the two without giving any proof or reasonable explanation. Most of the time the funding source for each of these institutions have nothing in common. If anything, its the bank funding the medical profession than the other way around. 

&gt; Therefore if banking pays more than doctoring, the best will be attracted to banking rather than medicine.

This is not true at all! Just give me some numbers which allowed you to make this deduction. The average banker salary is heavily skewed by the few who make a lot more. This is what I'm on about. Most bankers do not earn millions, like journalists will have you believe. And again, you just built up this correlation between medical professionals and bankers. Let me put it in simple terms; their money is not going from the same pot. ",1,1394470044,null,0,false,0,cfz27lh,t3_201had,t1_cfz27lh,t1_cfz0wjy,null,1432738937,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To explain my post: I didn't presume you were ""ignorant"" because of your opinions. I said what I said because you are unaware of the history that pertains directly to claims you made in your post. You said that ""in most communities any business who did decide to discriminate would suffer quite badly."" But the opposite is known to be true from history. For example, during the 1940s-1960s, the Southern 1/3rd of the United States, from Virginia to Texas, was willing to suffer massive economic losses in order to preserve Jim Crow apartheid. They were losing enormous sums of money to boycotts and lost business opportunities. They directly confronted this dilemma and explicitly decided that preservation of white power was more important to them than maximizing their return on investments. They were willing to suffer big economic losses to keep blacks in bondage. The only reason they didn't continue their system of apartheid is the passage of civil rights legislation, the most critical of which was the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

A hundred years earlier, the South was willing to see their lands burned to the ground before giving up slavery.

Claims like the one you made - that the free market will punish racism - is dangerous, because it makes a false promise. If too many people believe your claims about the free market, we risk a return to Jim Crow apartheid. Rights need to be protected by law. We cannot count on the magical free market fairy to preserve them -- especially when there is dramatic recent history that proves the free market does not work that way.",0,1394470727,null,0,1394470942,0,cfz2isl,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfz2isl,t1_cfy5q8v,null,1432739087,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

And with the upcoming eighth series, you'll be all ready to start watching the new episodes as they come!

You should also watch select episodes of the other Doctors, both New and Old. Important Eccleston ones include ""Rose,"" ""Dalek,"" ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways."" I'd also suggest seeing the popular ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" duet.

For Tennant, ""Blink"" is a necessity. ""The Girl in the Fire Place"" is also pretty great, and the three-parter of ""Utopia,"" ""The Sound of Drums"" and ""The Last of the Time Lords"" are special because of the enemy faced.

true,darmani11,IQ,iraq,"Ok, so I know this sounds bad, but I was a barcelona fan first. Not because of the team's prestigious record, but because of Messi. Not just messi perhaps but the fact that Maradona was  player I was already familiar with and always preferred ahead of other legends back then.

I've always liked Chelsea though. I don't know what it was about them but I liked them more than the average team, even before the world cup. Drogba, Malouda, Super Frank, Anelka, Terry, even Kalou. I knew them before I started caring about football.

It was the before of the world cup, and I already loved football, but my dad never really forced a team on my, as he is a generally neutral fan. Only team I seriously supported back then was the Iraqi National Team.

I decided to choose Argentina as my team to win the world cup. I had no idea who a lot of the big names were, but the WC is usually when players make an impact and make you remember their names. 

I got a general list of players names, and obviously Klose and Villa's names were being said everywhere. I stuck with Messi and his Argentina the whole WC, and watched as Germany thrashed them in the quarter? Finals. Didn't pick any new team or anything.

As a Barcelona fan, I was just getting to know the massive world of football, so I guess it was easier to be a barca fan back then because their was only 2 matches a year in the league+ the CL+ the League cup classico's, but that was also a bad thing. Also horrible fan base.

I don't know about you, but it was not only boring to watch barca play, but pep won everything massively with a very boring play style. Though Messi was still a good player to watch back then.

I noticed I didn't like Barcelona so I kind of shifted my support fully towards Chelsea before the CL 2012. Stopped liking Barcelona fully now, as not even Messi feels like the same player as before. I'm still going for Argentina for the world cup, but not mainly for Messi. 

I know it sounds like I'm glory hunting or something, but let me highlight that I've always had a passion for Chelsea, even before the WC, but wrongly supported Barcelona for awhile. 

Before, I watched barca very rarely. Now I can't miss a CFC match.

&gt;The __1998 [UEFA Super Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup)__ was a [football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) match that was played on 28 August 1998 at [Stade Louis II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Louis_II), [Monaco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco), contested between [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_UEFA_Champions_League) winners [Real Madrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.) and [Cup Winners' Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup) holders [Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.). Neither team had previously won the trophy. Chelsea won the match 1–0 with a late goal from [Gus Poyet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Poyet).

&gt;This was not the first Super Cup to be played as a one-off match at a neutral venue. Previously it was played over two legs, although on some occasions, only one match was played, due to special circumstances.

Put on top of that the fact that for whatever reason we loaned out Benny and did not buy or get any LB on loan also would probably make it aggravating to him since we probably could have covered leftback without him for at least a good amount of time if we had actually brought in anyone for that side.

Yes, we haven't won a league, but we haven't had a starting XI like this in years, and with the manc scum disappearing off of the top 6, we've got one less team to worry about beating us to the title.

4) Not as good as rivals:

* Manager - Debatable between Pelligrini in my opinion, but maybe Mourinho is a bit better than Rodgers

* Worse players - In some positions (Particularly in defence), perhaps, but our midfield is solid, and we have the two best strikers in the league up front

* Squad depth - Nothing I can say, fair enough

* ""If you get any injuries, you're screwed"" -  Daniel Sturridge, Phillipe Coutinho, Lucas Leiva, Steven Gerrard, Joe Allen, Glen Johnson, Jose Enrique, Daniel Agger and Mamodou Sakho have all picked up injuries so far this season, and Suarez was suspended for 5 games at the star of the season (One of the matches he missed being a victory vs. Man United, I should add...) We've dealt with injuries well so far this season.

3) Tough Run-In:

Arsenal still have to play:

* Manchester City

* Tottenham Hotspur

* Chelsea

* Everton

Manchester City still have to play:

* Manchester United

* Arsenal

* Liverpool

* Everton

Chelsea still have to play:

* Arsenal

* Liverpool

Also add in the chance of any of them going through to the next round of the Champions League, and their run in could be as tough, if not tougher, than ours.

2) Poor defense: 

We've been without our starting back four for months. Johnson's now back, and people have been saying he was incredible in the England game (I was unable to watch it), and Agger and Sakho are returning, too. Aly Cissokho isn't terrible in defence, and Jon Flanagan's best trait is defending. We can certainly tighten up at the back in the next few weeks, once our best defenders get playing with each other again. That, and we're the best goalscoring side in the league so far, so even if we're shit in defence, we can still win every game 6-3 or 6-4. 

1) You're Sh*t!

""Shit team""

Better than last year's champions are now, at least.

""Shit players"" 

* Luis Suarez: One of the best strikers in the world. Best player in the league, bar none. 

* Daniel Sturridge: Second best striker in the league, if it weren't for Suarez, he'd be the best. Better than any striker at Chelsea, Spurs, Arsenal or City. 

* Steven Gerrard: Steven fucking Gerrard. England captain. Arguably one of the best English players in history. Can score from distance, create, defend, attack, take set pieces like you've never seen before, and be a driving force for the team that constantly leads by example. He can single-handedly pull results out of the bag for us on days where we may not have been up to scratch. (See: Fulham)

* Jordan Henderson

* Philippe Coutinho

* Daniel Agger

* Mamadou Sakho

I could go on, but I won't. But I could.

""Shit manager"" Turned a team that finished EIGHTH in the season he took over to genuine title contenders in one year. Giving youth players the chance of their dreams. Investing in young, talented players for low prices (Coutinho) and giving forgotten players another chance (Sturridge). Building an empire; a bastion of invincibility.

""Shit Stadium"" Probably the best atmosphere in the premier league, and it's only going to improve with the expansion of the seating. And we don't even have to hire sound technicians to come in and design the stadium so it sounds louder than it actually is!

""Shit... mental... state..."" The team spirit at this club is incredible. They've been able to drive themselves on and  keep their focus in games that they could have easily let their heads drop (Swansea home, Fulham away etc.), games where *OTHER* teams did lose focus, and ended up dropping points at crucial stages *COUGH* United vs. Fulham *COUGH*

I fell in love with the players, the team, the culture - everything. I did my masters at University of London in Sports Management because I fell in love with this team. I've also met some of my closest friends in San Francisco because we have a solid group that wakes up early to get to the bars and watch the games.

The thing is that it didn't feel though that people were drawn to Berlin in the way that UK people were drawn to London. In the old days, it was the politicians and the bureaucrats. Regional capitals like Munich, Stuttgart and so on carried on doing their own thing.

Since WW2 though, it is certainly public transport that is one factor that has taken off with coverage more or less equal over the major cities. In the UK, London has done very well for public transport but the rest to a much more limited extent.

&gt;Then methods being used to achieve this glorious stable economy is austerity, which has never worked in history other than to soften up public sector services and assets for sale to the private sector. Its been a choice to deploy austerity, not a mandated requirement by any means or outcome.

And yet it is working, we are coming out of the recession better than most similar Western nations, and unemployment will decrease in the next few years.

&gt;The arena facade is constructed of 2,874 [ETFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETFE)-foil air panels that are kept inflated with dry air to a differential pressure of 3.5 [Pa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit\)).  The panels appear white from far away but when examined closely, there are little dots on the panels. When viewed from far away, the eye combines the dots and sees white. When viewed close up however, it is possible to see through the foil. The foil has a thickness of 0.2 mm. Each panel can be independently lit with white, red, or blue light. The panels are lit for each game with the colors of the respective home team—red for Bayern Munich, blue for TSV and white for the [German national football team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team). White is also used when the stadium is a neutral venue, like the [2012 UEFA Champions League Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_UEFA_Champions_League_Final). Other colours or multicolor or interchanging lighting schemes are theoretically possible, but Munich Police strongly insists on uni-color only due to several car accidents on the nearby A9 Autobahn with drivers being distracted by the changing lights.

A good cosplay isn't decided on how many people do that particular cosplay, it's decided on if that Cosplay is a good representation of the character.

No, there are not many Jackson Lake cosplays, so kudos to the guy in this picture for trying to push the boat out a little. But at the same time it is an absolutely minimal effort cosplay, with little to no research done on what he actually wore (it is not hard to get a hold of a cravat and that looks more like a jedi robe than a coat). 

Without that picture, I wouldn't know who the hell he was trying to be. I'd assume that he was some sort of Star Wars side character I hadn't seen.

Even that sounds like arbitrary targets written to allow cheaper technology to be used - 24Mbps is quite easily achievable with FTTC on long lines today, but it doesn't provide for any speed increases in the future without drastic changes like line bonding or FTTP. So in a few years, urban areas will be on 100Mbps or gigabit while the country bumpkins are dragged along at something far less. Like today.

I'm more inclined to blame the government for BDUK's failings. The not-BDUK project in Cornwall has done far better, plenty of coverage in a couple of years (and some FTTP to boot) and the project is running ahead of schedule. This is with BT doing the work, same as in the BDUK areas, and a couple of unique challenges like having to lay a new undersea cable to get enough bandwidth to the Isles of Scilly. Unfortunately there's still more FTTC than there should be.

true,thisratwouldlikepie,flair8,,"He's been excellent in the middle, but he's been shit at left back where he's been deployed for most of the campaign. He's getting frustrated over it too, he plays like a central defender and looks lost as a fullback and it shows. Just look at yesterday's game, if he had slipped and knocked the ball like that (instinctually) from his normal position it would have been a safe play, but because he's at left back his instinct is wrong and he gives up an easy goal. Meanwhile, the center backs have been shit. I think he's sick of it right now, and he's made statements to that effect. I think that LVG can and will get this turned around though, he'll sit the player down, talk to him and show him how he'll be the anchor of a rebuilt defense that takes us to Champion's league. Personally, I think Sherwood hit the nail on the head yesterday when he spoke about the team character, we haven't played like this since the days of Ramos and yet team spirits always seem to be high except for a few players, the real winners and competitors, and those guys are getting frustrated. You can't expect a Vertongen or a Lloris to be happy on a team where they're in it to play some games, win some, lose some and joke around a lot. They want to play for a team that has fire, for the kind of team where winning is everything and every loss is devastating. LVG will be able to convince them that he'll be able to turn them into that kind of team and they will stay to see what he does with them. Jan came to Spurs to be a Spurs legend, he can get back on that track but for now I think he's getting frustrated with the lack of heart and desire on the team, as well as being played out of position because they didn't start the season with enough left backs. He's still one of my favourites, I'm just glad that someone on the field is as frustrated with the way that Spurs have played this year as we are.",0,1394476755,null,0,false,0,cfz5ebr,t3_20216p,t1_cfz5ebr,t3_20216p,null,1432740438,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

We've had what, the best part of a decade where we've been trying to get either an expansion or a new stadium built, and so far we don't even have final renders and detailed draft plans released of ""this is what's going to happen and what it will look like"". And that's just with one set of club owners, and one set of supporters to consult. Do we build on Anfield, Goodison, or neither? What happens regarding things like ashes scattered onto the pitch of Anfield if we relocate? What do we call it, what colour are the seats, how does sponsorship work around the ground, what capacity do we go for given Everton potentially wouldn't fill an 80,000 capacity stadium every week, but it wouldn't make sense for us to build a new stadium unless it was around that size?

If ""does it make more financial sense or not"" was the only thing that mattered, we'd have gotten a ground share built ages ago. But it's not. There's a huge amount of fucking around and red tape and logistics involved in sorting out a new stadium, and adding a groundshare into that just complicates it so much more. It'd make more financial sense for me to keep living with my parents instead of renting my own place, but that doesn't mean I'll be packing my bags and moving back home because it's not that simple.

You want to make sure you're being healthy though dude. I'm on a weight loss programme myself as I'm a big guy. Get your exercise in, tea instead of soda is always good. Make sure if you're cutting down on food that you're getting all the right vitamins. For the love of The Emperor do the latter part.

Don't be. We're all completely bonkers most of the time.

Talk about what you like when someone posts a thread and you'll get replies from someone having banter or questioning why something is (Unless it's Bocks, then he's hammered ... but we love him)

I like to think I'm a good person, so maybe i'll have no trouble finding people, or partners, when I get in better shape, but who knows. It's just nice to have you guys here. You're all so nice, and it makes me feel less lonesome.

Good. Part of getting out of the rut is knowing how to speak to people. You'll get there. Everyone does.

&gt; Thanks all. It's been a pleasure. I should try commenting more, I just never have anything good to say that won't sound stupid to you lot.

&gt;

&gt;__Leonard Steinberg, Baron Steinberg__ (1 August 1936 - 2 November 2009) was a [British](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [life peer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_peer) and [multi-millionaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire) [businessman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businessman). 

&gt;Born in [Belfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast) on 1 August 1936, Steinberg was the founder and Non-Executive [Chairman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman) of Stanley Leisure Ltd.  The business was founded in Belfast in 1958, but Steinberg moved to [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) in 1977 when he refused to pay [protection money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_money) to either [republican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_republicanism) or [loyalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) paramilitaries, and after he was shot on 23 February 1977 by the [Provisional Irish Republican Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army).    Despite his move to England, he continued to describe himself thus: ""I am Jewish, [Northern Irish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish), and an [Ulster Unionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Unionist)"" 

&gt;Since 2005, Stanley Leisure has seen changes of ownership, with [William Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hill_(bookmaker\)) buying the bookmaking operations and the [Genting Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genting_Group) buying the casino operation.  Steinberg sold a large number of his shares in 2004, but retained 11.3% of the company's [stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance\)).

true,Muck777,null,null,"&gt;  I said what I said because you are unaware of the history that pertains directly to claims you made in your post. You said that ""in most communities any business who did decide to discriminate would suffer quite badly."" But the opposite is known to be true from history. For example, during the 1940s-1960s, the Southern 1/3rd of the United States, from Virginia to Texas, was willing to suffer massive economic losses in order to preserve Jim Crow apartheid. They were losing enormous sums of money to boycotts and lost business opportunities. They directly confronted this dilemma and explicitly decided that preservation of white power was more important to them than maximizing their return on investments. They were willing to suffer big economic losses to keep blacks in bondage. The only reason they didn't continue their system of apartheid is the passage of civil rights legislation, the most critical of which was the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

So what you're saying is that any business who did decide to discriminate *will* suffer quite badly? I think that's what I said.

I also believe that society has moved on from those times.  The Jim Crow laws were enacted about 150 years ago and were a continuation of laws from over 200 years ago, and abolished about 50 years ago. Would anyone who exposed Jim Crow type laws be voted for today? We know the answer, at least in the UK, because we've had the National Front and the British National Party standing in elections for about 40 years. They never achieve anything, and never will, but there's a distinct difference between a law and an opinion. 

In the UK you are entitled to express your racial, religious or sexual bigotry as long as you're not advocating hate, or harassing someone. We recently had a case where [two Christian guest house owners](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25119158) were prosecuted because they didn't want to accommodate a gay unmarried couple. I'm not religious, but I can understand that if you're a religious hotelier you might want to refuse certain customers. It's not an action I applaud, but I do believe that people should be allowed to hold whatever beliefs they like, and in our current system they are either forced to be dishonest by finding an excuse to refuse service, or being forced to serve a customer who they object to, which, I imagine, would often lead to sub-standard service. 

The reason I support it is because of transparency and honesty. I oppose any bigotry in any form, but if I'm not welcome somewhere I would much prefer to know before I even entered the premises. It's easier for me to find out if the owners want to be selective as to whom they serve, and I believe that a private business should be allowed to express an opinion in the same way an individual can. Fundamentally, many private businesses *are* an individual, as in the case of the guest house.  

&gt; 
&gt; Claims like the one you made - that the free market will punish racism - is dangerous, because it makes a false promise. If too many people believe your claims about the free market, we risk a return to Jim Crow apartheid.

No, that's a *law*. I'm talking about an opinion. 

&gt;Rights need to be protected by law. 

I agree. I think that the right to express your opinion should be protected too, but I think you're wrong if you believe that receiving service from every company is a 'right'. If it's privately owned it should be down to the discretion of the owner to serve who he wants for whatever reason he wants. 

It's *his* company.

You're setting this argument up. No one else. 

&gt;Not that I agree with the policies, but I don't for one second believe Cameron, or anyone else in government genuinely want to see people suffer.

Perhaps not, but they do want to see their ideology prevail, come what may. 

&gt;I know better than to think Mr Cameron is out to destroy the lives of the poor because he enjoys it, 

No one is saying that. Only you. 

&gt;because doing so is going to get us nowhere and is a stupid way to talk about why the policies are coming are coming out of whitehall are eroding the quality of life of the poor.

Which is why no one is. 

&gt;And at what point were my comments contradictory to that? 

Contradictory to what? You saying I'm saying Cameron enjoys hurting the poor, when I didn't say that? 

&gt;Seriously you've been deriding me over the last few exchanges for not thinking that, when actually at no point was I saying anything otherwise.

I'm sorry if you feel derided. I was overly harsh. I thought about deleting my comment, but decided not to, as I don't think its correct to do that.

Well, the way I see it is that it's a feature of their website that gets them views, but in real transfers I get the impression that it RARELY anywhere close. It plots the last price paid to get that player and then applies their own metrics to measure changes in worth. What a team would accept for a player, and what others would pay, would vary drastically. 

Suarez- 52 mill euro 

Giroud- 20 mill euro

Rooney- 45 mill euro

Hulk- 48 mill euro

David silva - 40 mill euro

Sure, some of these are around the mark, but it's all speculation. My point just being it's silly to base any predictions off these numbers. If a player is courted by multiple clubs, add 5 mill. If they're English, add 10. If you're selling to Chelsea/PSG, add 15. If the player is unsettled, cut it in half. You can offer a good chance of starting in a champions league team to a young player, that's tons of leverage as well.

How did you reach that conclusion? Public transport usage is far more common in dense areas because road networks do not keep up with very high populations.

For the same reason, the cheap public transport of buses are less adequate because of heavy road traffic. This leads to the need for more expensive alternatives, such as rail. Or due to a lack of space, even more expensive alternatives, such as underground rail.

Dense areas also tend to have more demand for land (hence their density), leading to more expensive housing and longer typical commutes.

United's problems have been well documented so no need to rehash what's been said. Everton play great football and I hold my hands up and say I was wrong as I really thought Martínez would flop, but they've spent a fraction the bigger team's have so I wouldn't expect them to have as many points. Southampton have the makings of a great side. Young, tenacious and stylish. I really like their approach and like their coach. Swansea are a very strange one.

Occasionally you'll get a gem in the class who you really like and is exceptionally better than everyone else, but teachers don't really develop close bonds to students in the UK, it's viewed as kinda weird. I guess it makes a lot of teachers really sad when they see their favourite pupil leave school without a goodbye and have to completely forget about them.  I remember a year after I left I went back to visit my old teachers just because I felt bad, a lot seemed really happy to see me, and some had left as well so I never got to say goodbye to them. Always kinda regret that. 

As for the curriculum: from my experience it's pretty strict and you can't be as lenient with your lessons as you'd like to, most of the time using someone else's lesson plans, that doesn't mean some lessons weren't great, but they'd be a rare occurrence in the 25 or so lessons a week I had. In terms of actual content much of it was great and really fun to learn, but only now that I'm older and appreciate it. I wish I still had my GCSE english literature anthology, it's out of print now but I'd love to get one for nostalgias sakes.  

The smaller classes were the most fun, but I only got to experience them because of my ""smart student"" privilege. I was in a japanese class for 5 years with only 2 other students! 

Some teachers even taught lessons that weren't their primary focus.  I remember when I was in year 8 my english teacher was actually a classics teacher, and she'd single me out and give me books like the Odyssey and the Aeneid at the end of lessons. Looking back on it now she was grooming me to choose classics at GCSE because she kept telling me how great it was, but she left to teach at a girls grammar school before I hit year 10 so I never did.

When they sell the house, they sell for 212k, and pay the mortgage off in full, so they subtract 104k from their total, they have then profited by 8k, 8k = 4% of the price.

2. 500k house, 5% mortgage of 400k. Value after a year, 530k. 
Interest after 1 year = 20,000. 

That gives 10k profit on the sale, and only a yield of 2%

Summary - 
10k (2%) Vs. 8k (4%) 

Yes there are some assumptions(more expensive to borrow more being one), and a lot of costs ignored, but a larger house is more expensive to run and maintain, plus stamp duty. I would say that you would be better off from an investment view, to buy smaller. And move more frequently, as leveraging less of the cost means a higher margin.

Seriously, actually do some research before posting. All bank bailouts from 2007 - 2009 period have actually been paid back by the banks. The government is now selling its stake in the banks at a profit. The first tranche of Lloyds shares have gotten a 60 million profit.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"Cech: I see too many people stating he has been ""average"" this season for the simple fact that they don't really understand what Cech does and he does not make spectacular saves. Hint: Because he doesn't have to.

Sure he has made a few mistakes, every keeper has, yes, even Courtois. And one of Courtios mistake actually cost them a game. 

And lastly, I've said it before, but, I am still waiting for the source of the ""Cech wanting to retire early"" shit.

Current back 4: I have been very surprised by Terry, more than Mourinho, Cahills emergence and his partnership with Terry has extended Terrys career. With that said, I don't see the back 4 changing next season.

David Luiz: Obviously he is still a very good CB, unfortunately, just like Mata, Mourinhos system doesn't fit him. His quality is something good to have, able to start as a CB or DM. But, I don't think he will be happy not playing regularly. I could see him move this summer.

Luke Shaw: I just do not see it anymore. Perhaps last summer, but now, there is very little reason to sign him. He is going to cost too much and for what? Azpi has been great, he is not going to start over Azpi. And Mourinho is definitely not going to move Brana just for Shaw. If Mourinho didn't start Brana as a CB when Cahill, Terry and Luiz had injuries, he is not going to start Brana as a CB next season. There is a purpose to Brana being as a RB, and that is is bully the wingers.

Zouma: This kid is built like a tank, he should be ready. I am hoping he will get some league cup games.

Kalas: Very disappointed that he hasn't been given a chance. He should have been just loaned out instead of Bertrand.

Speaking of Bertrand, he should be gone. Just not good enough for Chelsea.

Omeruo: Needs more experience. Probably only Wallace is further down the list.

Ake: I'm not sure he has physically matured. If he were to play CB, it won't be next season. If he is to play as a midfielder, he could get some time.

Van Aanholt: Also part of the reason why Shaw is not needed. Whoever Chelsea brings, they are going play behind either Azpi or Brana. Van Aanholt should be given that chance. He has been playing well.

Chalobah: Needs to be loaned to a premier league club.

Wallace: Worst signing of Inter this season.

I like this country, but I'd prefer if people didn't get too keen about it. Patriotism tends to encourage people to rest on their laurels, and I don't think anyone benefits from the 'patriotic' idea that Britain is perfect already and can't change or improve. 

It feels like this is often the case in other, more patriotic countries. For example, lots of people seem to think that the US Constitution is infallible and the greatest document ever put to paper. Well, I'll agree that it's extremely significant, and that in many ways it broke new political ground. On the other hand, its ambiguity has been the cause of endless fighting over things like what constitutes free speech or exactly who should be allowed to bear what arms. 

Another example - the BNP/EDL/Golden Dawn/FN/etc are far more obsessed with national identity and pride than any other organisation. Closely coupled to their pride (at the expense of everyone else), they are a cause of violence, racial tensions and prejudice.

I think maintaining a healthy level of skepticism about your own country is vital to maintaining an effective democracy. I would like an effective democracy in Britain, so I would like people to combine both some skepticism of 'the system' and some pride in the things that Britain does achieve.

If he's not beating people out wide anymore (maybe he's lost a step of pace?), he's not much use.  I think that for each side of the pitch we should have one wide winger and one inverted winger, so I'd say we need a new wide RW this summer. 

I also think you're right on basically all points.

The other option I'd look at is swapping Soldado for Townsend and playing a 4-3-3 with Lamela, Ade, and Bobby up front.  Miles and miles of creativity ...",0,1394491352,null,0,false,0,cfzck57,t3_201ppa,t1_cfzck57,t3_201ppa,null,1432743886,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Secondly, so what if we provide places for people around the world to store their wealth?  Rich foreigners exist, and I would rather they spend their money in the hotels, shops, clubs and restaurants of London than in Singapore or Hong Kong or Monaco.   Ultimately their presence, and the elite clothing/wealth management/luxury goods sectors that have spawned around them DO create jobs for British people of all income levels.

The article then goes on to very bizarrely almost lament the downfall of the British ruling class, who are now merely 'subservient' to foreign wealth apparently.  Leaving the ridiculousness of that aside, the reality is that instead of lamenting the end of Empire forever, we're now finally getting a grip and becoming a trading and banking capital of the world, something that ensures we will be able to continue to fund our state even when other industries like manufacturing have collapsed.

I haven't felt this shit about spurs in a very long time. The club is very rotten at the moment, stemming all the way from Levy and ENIC. after every week i see the same people, making these same threads, yet it's no different. 

how can any person who calls themselves a tottenham hotspur supporter watch the shit we have dished up this season and think there is room for optimism, think things can turn around, think it's just a blip WHEN IT'S NOT. it is down to the leadership of the club and has been since we sacked Martin Jol.

[Northern Rock](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/nov/17/northern-rock-sale-good-deal-for-taxpayers) - split in two, the good bit sold for a 480 million **loss**, the bad bit, 20 billion in potential bad debt still owned by the taxpayer.

&gt; The first tranche of Lloyds shares have gotten a 60 million profit.

Wow, a whole 60 million.

"" The shares in RBS and Lloyds were purchased for £66 billion and as at 31 March 2013 had a market value of £38 billion, a total **decrease** in value of £28 billion.""

The interest we are paying : ""We estimate the total financing costs of the financial stability measures are £5 billion a year and have totalled **£20 billion** to 31 March 2013.

""As at 31 March 2013, the Treasury had received a total of £16 billion in fees and interest for providing the support and assuming the risks covered by the guarantees since 2008. **This is below the cumulative finance cost.** 

So the money we have received is less than the interest we have paid on the money we borrowed for the bail out.

""Unless the shares in RBS and Lloyds Banking Group start paying substantial dividends, **the government as a whole will make annual cash losses on the support** once the cost of borrowing the money to purchase the shares and provide the loans is taken into account.

I like the Bill Hicks (comedian/social commentator) joke/idea/philosophy that instead of flags of colours and stripes etc we should instead have images of our parents copulating - no one's going to be waving that flag. Yet that's what patriotism is, celebrating your birth onto a certain part of a spinning rock. People say ""We won the first world war and we should be proud of that"" when they themselves had absolutely nothing to do with it as it pre-dates their birth. I'm happy that my ancestors did everything they did to get me here, as if it were any different, I wouldn't be here, but that's it. 

National Anthem? I don't believe in God and I think the fact that we have a monarchy still is laughable/depressing depending on my mood so I think my position on that should be pretty clear. But you go ahead and sing, I will not deny you the joy.

If you're not pessimistic sometimes, you open yourself up to all kinds of abuse. 

However, I do concede I am sucked in to the flag waving when it comes to entertaining competition, I will be supporting England in the World Cup for instance. But I won't cry WHEN we fail to win, I'll have just had a good few weeks watching the footy with my mates.

true,elreydelasur,null,null,"You and I agree overall, but I do have one or two nitpicky things.

Simply because a country is in Europe and Europe is predominantly white does not make England a ""white"" country. Turkey is also in Europe, but you wouldn't call that a ""white"" country. 

I also don't like the way that you use the phrase ""become civilised."" Immigrants aren't uncivilised when they arrive in the UK, as they usually don't come from lawless or culture-less society. They come from other civilised societies that are different from the UK. As much as I love to joke about Inglin and being Civilised, it really doesn't go beyond the joke. UK laws don't provide some magic definition or higher standard of ""civilisation"" that other countries don't have.

That brings me to the debate of what should happen when English law and the law of a particular immigrant clashes. This comes up most often in England when Muslim extremists bitch about not being able to practice Sharia law since it conflicts with UK civil law. I fully agree with you that when it comes to the law of the land, the country you are in rules. I don't expect the laws of America to be held to in England, and a Middle Eastern immigrant to the UK needs to realize that the laws of his country of origin are superseded by the laws of the country he moved to. He chose to emigrate and he chose the UK so he has to live by the laws of the UK.

Cultural customs are another thing all together. Preservation of culture is key for many immigrants, and that is true of all immigrants to all country. Also, different cultures mixing together makes for stronger, more diverse societies and a more cosmopolitan populace. For example, most English people agree that curry is really good. If it weren't for Indian immigrants to the UK then curry would be less popular and be in less demand. You can make the same argument about Mexicans and mexican food in America.

Let's use the Middle Eastern immigrant example again. If he wants to come to the UK and be a practicing Muslim who prays 5 times a day and attends prayers at his mosque, it his right to do so. If he wants to eat only halal foods, then that is his right as well. Does that mean minarets should be installed to wake everyone up for sunrise prayers? No. Does that mean that we have to get rid of bacon and alcohol? No. 

Do you see the point I'm making? Mixing of cultures and preservation of immigrant culture and customs is totally fine. However, when a law or custom of an immigrant interferes with statutory or common law of a country, then the law supersedes.

I forget the bus number (think there are two or three of them), but that's what I did when I went last year around this time. (Looked it up with the Liverpool transit guide website.)

I went during international week last March on 3/19 I believe, and most of the stars were away. Don't spend your time walking around Melwood, there is only one entrance, or trying to figure out how you can see the players train. We did that and during that 40 minutes we spent walking around the perimeter, we found out later that Carra, Coutinho, and a few others had left and we didn't catch them. It was cold (~0 Celcius) that day and with the internationals, there were only about 5 people (including my wife and I) outside waiting, so everybody stopped for us.

We eventually got Flanno, Enrique, Lucas, and Rodgers' autographs/photos. A couple of funny things:
1) Many of the young players don't have licenses, so they get picked up by taxis instead of driving fancy sports cars!
2) Brendan's Porsche smelled really strongly of cologne. I took a photo of my wife with him from a few feet away, and could smell it coming from his rolled-down window.
3) Another young player got picked up by his dad, and when we heard the car coming, we started running over in anticipation. Not sure who it was, but his dad was shouting ""He's a nobody!

They live here, yet wave Mexican flags around and have a lot patriotic Mexican things on their vehicles, like Hecho en Mexico and other stuff like that. Many of them refuse to speak English aswell. Not all of them are like that, and a lot of them are as American as anyone else. I'm using this as an example because Hispanics are the American equivalent to Pakistanis or other people from middle eastern countries in the U.K. I'v just always though, if you live in this country, you should love it, if not, you can go to the place which you or your ancestors hail from.

I'm assuming it has to do, at a very basic level, with simple compassion. Some poor bastard's country has been blown to hell by people he doesn't like, so what's he to do for himself and his family but go somewhere else? The UK also has a history of colonialism that America doesn't have to the same extent, and that plays a part in it.

Try not to make too many parallels between US and UK immigration laws. Both countries have vastly different histories and marginally different political systems. 

In all honesty, who gives a shit what Mexicans do when it comes to their culture? If they wanna wave Mexican flags because they are from there or have family from there then who the hell cares? You can go waive your flag all you want, so why can't they? You also have no idea who is here legally and who is not, so to assume ""most"" are here illegally is false. 

I'm with you on the English-speaking though. That is one cultural custom that should be preserved in the home, but English should be used in public. An unwillingness to learn English is not an excuse to not speak it. I learned how to speak Spanish (even though I didn't have to), so any non-English speaker has to make an effort to learn English when they get here. I'm even for local governments holding classes to teach English to immigrants. 

As an English immigrant to America (totally legal, don't worry), am I not allowed to waive the English flag or put ""Made in England"" on my car? Is America so under-inclusive that I can't retain pride for where I'm from? No. This country has a rich immigrant history and I am proud to be a very tiny piece of it.

Where I live the majority of hispanics are from California or Texas, the ones that lived in the region whenever the U.S. took over in the 1840's, but you can usually tell if they speak English with a thick Amerinid Spanish accent.

I kid you not, the only American flag in that entire crowd was on the shoulder of a police officer. If they love America so much and want to be American, than why weren't the demonstrators waving American flags?)

Most people I know that are from other countries have their mother countries flags and all, and at least one American flag somewhere. I personally don't care, be proud of where you're from, but also be proud of the country you are currently living in. I was born here and I have a British flag and a German Flag. I have them as wall hangers, but they just remind me of the main 2 countries my ancestors originate from, and the UK flag just has a nice look to it. I know some people from Brazil and a friend of mine is moving here from the U.K. The Brazilians I know have the flag of Brazil and the U.S. Flag side by side on the outside of their house.

 Actually DNA is.. it is quite possibly the worst form of identification you have because it has no exclusivity whatsoever. You leave it absolutely everywhere you go. Your hair, your skin cells, your saliva, your sweat, everything you touch, each time you sneeze, every breath you take etc..  I am waiting for the day when the technology becomes small enough and cheap enough that any criminal (or shadowy government agency)  can take any part of your DNA and replicate it and leave it somewhere to either incriminate you or blackmail you.

Ramires has poor passing technique for a player at this level, and Mikel usually opts to the side and back rather than forward.

Bayern: Schweinsteiger, Kroos, Thiago, Martinez, Lahm

Madrid: Khedira, Alonso, Modric, Illara

Juventus: Vidal, Pirlo, Pogba

This season he has coped with two somewhat serious injuries which he hasn't really had to do in his career, and I think that has frustrated him. Again he's also had to play at left back a lot because our defenders are made of balsa wood. I hope HIS durability doesn't become an issue.

Frustrations gotten the best of me after bad games, or confusing decisions, or interacting with stupid fans. But I've never meant it. I could never actually give up on Spurs. Or support another team. 

This is the club I've loved since the early 2000s. This is the club I've watched struggle against mid table clubs for years. This is the club I've watched grow over the years. This is the club that gave me the greatest moment in sports fandom that i've ever experienced (When we beat City to qualify for the CL the first time. I'll never forget where I was when Crouch scored that goal.) 

Sure I get frustrated at times. Sure I've said i'm done with this club. But I've never meant it. I've always been back the next week watching the game. 

To me Spurs are like family. Sure you get mad at your family sometimes. You may in a moment of anger say something mean to them, tell them to fuck off. But (most of the time) you don't actually mean it. You still love them. You still care about them and you'll always support them.

The show returned in 2005, but the season numbers were reset with Series 1 (Christopher Eccleston's season as the Doctor). I assume you mean all of the current series (""new-Who""), not the whole 50 years of the series.

Series 8 doesn't start until, like, August, so it's not like you won't have time to catch up. Series 1 (2005) was designed as a reintroduction, so you won't be confused if you don't watch any of the 1963-1989 series or the 1996 TV movie. If you're willing to, I'd say start there, though be aware it can be a bit on the campy/kiddie side at first (it grows up, though, don't worry).

If you're worried about catching up quickly or don't like the camp of the 2005 series, start with Series 5 (2010; Matt Smith's first season as the Doctor). I'd recommend watching the Series 4 episodes *Silence in the Library* and *Forest of the Dead* before starting Series 5, though.
