3. EU has ruled out for Cameron despite his deepest deplorations ""New Treaty Change"" before 2017. 

So that is all that is left to Cameron: To stay IN the EU.

There is an alternative if he decided we really do need to be ""all in and serious on these negotiations"":-

/4. ""Article 50"": But despite it achieving everything he says he wants: He will never never touch it with a barge pole.

/5. And that brings us nicely to UKIP who want ""above"" Article 50 (lol!). :-)

I read tons of SF when I was a child of divorce at a time when that was still unusual, even in New York City.  SF was my distraction, and my promise that life would get less stressful and confining and more adventurous.  SF was my key to the enormity of the universe and its potentialities (Arthur C. Clarke's stories -- ""2001"" but also many others -- really cracked my brain open, in a *good* way).  Once I stumbled upon Doctor Who, I watched it for the entertainment of adventure and surprises, on and off.  But then I began writing my own SF, and the entire SF world overwhelmed the Doctor's stories.  When I returned to the show, it was Eccelston's gritty Doctor that brought me, but before long ""Who"" became too helper-skelter, and later still too ""daytime soaps"", for my tastes.

Stephen Capaldi's Doctor brought me back, and he's ""my Doctor"" now that he's quit playing the madcap young romantic and reclaimed his (2000 year old!) maturity and gravitas.  I'm 75 myself, and hoping this Doctor can speak to the experiences of older fans like me, who look back on their lives with such a rich mix of emotions, judgments, regrets, and hopes -- but without losing new generations of younger fans still keen for lots of action and adventure.  It's going to be a very, very interesting balancing act to watch.

That's just not true. He has had to tweak the system a number of times and has been regularly experimenting with his lineups and formations. Also, the formation is just one part of the system. Just because he went with a 442 this game with Eriksen starting on the left and Lennon on the right doesn't mean that he abandoned his system. 


We were able to still play a slightly higher line, high-pressure defense, and for once were able to offer a fluid, open passing system.  Those are the hallmarks of his system and they existed yesterday.  He has taken account that the players are different, mostly better, than those at Southampton and has had to consistently play with the lineup to make it work.

Obviously this doesn't class *unknown victims*, but a jump up to the 10,000 to 13,000 range seems dubiously high - especially given the focus on human trafficking and illegal immigration in recent years. 

The 13,000 figure comes from the [Modern Slavery Strategy (Nov 2014) document](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381737/ModernSlaveryStrategy.pdf) pumped out by the home office (and no doubt its beyond the realm of possibility that with all the cuts coming in next parliament they'd want to promote inflated figures or widely publicise such an emotive issue). 

The gent who came up with the figures, Chief Scientific Adviser Professor Bernard Silverman [co-wrote an article on StatsLife](http://www.statslife.org.uk/opinion/1607-measuring-modern-slavery-making-the-invisible-visible) which details very little of the problems with the old estimates and rigours of the new. I'm sure there is some reasonable logic that was used to arrive at the figure of 10-13000, but until I see the definitions and methodology used I'd be more inclined to think its nearer half the lower bound (~5000-6000).

With all that said and just to put the 13,000 figure in perspective; even if we assume ALL slaves are freed every year and replaced with fresh ones, we're still talking about 2.3% of our yearly immigration figure (583,000).  Realistically we're going to be talking fractions of a percent of immigration numbers (representing the human trafficking part) and 0.02% of a 60 million population as supposed ""slaves"".

Yes its a terrible crime, but the resources allocated are already more than likely adequate to the scale of the problem.

Unless you are wanting to be paying towards the property in the long run, with a view to owning it outright, interest only might be an option to consider.

You're right that it wouldn't leave a lot at all, and you need to consider additional costs. As one example, if the boiler suddenly breaks down that can be one months worth of rent gone fixing it, but because more than half goes on the mortgage you'll need to find that money out of your own savings. If further problems develop then that's more money - with only £700 a month coming in and well over 50% of that going on mortgage, you're going to be stuck in such situations unless you've set aside funding. In addition, what's the contingency if a tenant stops paying rent? - eviction procedures can take months and cost you significant sums. Although this is undoubtedly extreme, it's worth considering whether you have enough capital to risk these occurrences.

false,Anonymous_318,scot-ayrshire,Glasgow,"TL;DR: I'm going to say the article is pure click bait and looking at the comments at the bottom of it and in here it seems it has succeeded. Honestly, after having actually read the legislation and figuring out how it applies and what it applies to, the uninformed comments and opinions make me cringe. Feel free to provide me with sources to the contrary. 

/u/icyDRFT , you've quoted that directly from Vice and I don't see any reputable source reporting this nor have any reputable journal articles been submitted in response to the amendments to the 2003 Act. I've read the act and how the amendments fit into the context of the 2003 Act. I've also read the comments and everyone is just responding to that article alone and not citing anything from any other material.

&gt;Isn't that a bit extreme banning that?

Those acts are not ""banned"". The explanatory note for the amendments seem to suggest the act was brought in to inhibit easy access to R18 (or un-certified) on-demand programmes for under 18s. This is why many sites will say ""please confirm you are over 18"" or to that effect. That means, for example, if you try to access the BBC iPlayer and it decides to allow you to watch porn, there has to be a barrier to overcome (and those barriers are superfluous at best)

Even then, how does this apply to online porn? Porn, especially niche porn, is not content that is normally included in television programme services: 

&gt;(1) For the purposes of this Act, a service is an “on-demand programme service” if—
&gt;(a) its principal purpose is the provision of programmes the form and content of which are comparable to the form and content of programmes normally &gt;included in television programme services;

Additionally, there's no way this applies to any online service from the outside of the UK:

&gt;(1) For the purposes of this Act, a service is an “on-demand programme service” if—
&gt;that person [who has editorial responsibility] is under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.

After having read the legislation that this applies to I can not find anything that has been discussed on here. Specifically the issues that you have called ""a bit extreme banning that"". Please, someone, feel free to chip in and provide me with a reputable source discussing this issue. Specifically to acts of BDSM being banned (or the filming of them).

I'm not sure if Poche's press and counter-attacking game has use for a DLP. It seems that he wants his CMs to shield the back 4 and push the ball quickly to the hole/#10/gaps in front of the opposing defense. Once the ball is with the attackers/wingers they can do the brunt of the work while CMs recycle possession and get in good positions to shoot or assist. 

As a side-note, Modric hasn't played as a DLP for a year or 2. I feel like elite teams are starting to realize that sitting Gerrard, Pirlo, or whoever in front of the defense causes trouble. Xabi Alonso and Modric are 2 examples of DLPs who successfully transitioned to a B2B system and benefited from it. 

Teams that have 70% possession may thrive with a DLP (Xavi at Barca, Fabregas at Chelsea, Scholes at Utd), but 1) we aren't one of those teams (we had 35% possession against Everton) and 2) I feel like this breed of player is becoming obsolete in general. I wouldn't stress out too much about replacing Modric or Bale or VdV or *gasp* King. We play a different game with different management and an entirely different team (except for ol' Aaron Lennon it seems), so it isn't fair to the manager to expect him to recreate our old team. 

There is more than one way to win a football match.

What are you suggesting Soldado offers that Kane doesn't?  I know Kane hasn't flourished as a typical number 9 in the few times he's been offered the chance, but Soldado has not been any better on average and certainly not of late when he has.

I don't think so, because no one would listen to him. He really just devotes his time to raising awareness. He's a millionaire but what's a few million going to do to help the country. It would do nothing. Systematic change is what we need, not charity. He doesn't seem to have have a particularly extravagant lifestyle anymore and there's no good reason why everyone shouldn't live a good quality of life. 

Everyone keeps pointing their fingers at him, instead of the people who are causing the problems. He isn't advocating for poverty, he's advocating for everyone to have a good quality of life. I'll never get my head around why socialists seem to want everyone to live a mediocre quality of life. With genuine, far-reaching systematic change everyone could be living well. 

Or he could donate all of his money and disappear like everyone else. Let's say there are 10 million people living in poverty and Russell Brand is worth £10 million (I have no fucking clue about the figures by the way for either of those). Everyone would get £1 which would achieve nothing whatsoever but at least he wouldn't be a hypocrite anymore. What you're asking for is based on a purely ideological perspective, ignoring the reality which is that in the grand scheme of things, Russell Brand isn't the problem and seems to be doing a lot to get people interested in alternative politics. 

He benefits now but he certainly didn't benefit as a child. People seem to want to drag him down back into poverty. I bet none of those people would listen to him even if he were poor.

The idea is that the gentrification of London, driven by the demand for luxury expensive flats, is forcing out even the people that would be defined as middle class. In fact such a scenario is exactly why these people are being forced out, because their properties aren't yielding enough relatively to the location they're in. A far better way to make money would be to redevelop the area into some nice apartments and sell each up at £250,000 a pop. 

I don't think this argument works because there should be room for different kinds of housing in a successful city. You cannot have a city where only the rich reside as it would cause workers to leave and harm the economy. Even if it makes sense from a business point of view to skim as much money out of each plot of land as you can it doesn't make sense from the City's point of view and as such the Government needs to intervene. 

However it's a fair question to ask Brand. Brand needs to do better at responding to valid lines of questioning. This fans need to stop excusing him for the fact he is pretty childish and poor at dealing with it.

&gt; Now obviously there are many factors at play when it comes to property pricing and there is much that could be done to lessen the burden of high property pricing (increasing the number of public housing, cutting redtape on construction, ect).

&gt; The problem with Brand is that he chooses the easy path, cynicism without regard for the difficult choices that have to be made. I don't begrudge Brands decision to live in London or live in the property of his choice, but he doesn't seem willing to understand or even to acknowledge that it is people like him (ie; the pretty wealthy) that is often driving London's very high prices.

Look, what it boils down to is he has (presumably) £375k or thereabouts sitting in an account generating what's probably a shitty amount of interest. Maybe 3% at a push. Which funny enough works out at about £12k a year, so if he was renting at £1k, he'd about break even (though yes there are other expenses in that as well) however he still has his £375k, it's just tied up in an asset rather than a bank account. 

However, the property value will likely increase a substantial amount over the next few years. Looking at a 5 year forecast, a 10% gain in property value is reasonable (And actually underestimating a lot).

So at 3% interest over 5 years, that £375k turns into £434,727.78. We'll call it £435k.

Assuming rent of £1k per month over the same period, that's £60k in rent **alone**, the value of the property would also be somewhere near £412k making a grand total of £472k. Sure, he'll have expenses, but not £37k worth over a 5 year period.

Now remember that's a lot of underestimating, rent could easily be much higher than £1k per month and it would go up around 5% each year. The 10% property value increase is also highly conservative, the UK average is forecast closer to 19%. If it all goes badly, he's still looking to score a good £35k more than if he leaves that money sitting in an account. If it goes as expected and he can bump the rent up a bit, as well as raise it over the next 5 years, he's easily going to break £500k and probably be closer to £550k. After just 5 years.

Much of what she said didn't stand up to  a lot of scrutiny (with regards to policy), the idea that there are large swathes of old working class grandmothers who will be affected is nonsense (and even then, every policy has drawbacks).

The problem with that incident was that she was able to walk over him to publicly and Ed wasn't really able to take to task about it (the content barely mattered) and the deeper accusation that a lot Ed's policies is not driven by conviction but by focus groups and opinion polling.

My response from another part of the thread: ""There wasn't exactly a whole lot of time to expand on the line of questioning but I imagine he asked it because he was trying to illustrate that not only were house prices driven up because of high demand, but that there are many super rich who choose to live in London.

Now obviously there are many factors at play when it comes to property pricing and there is much that could be done to lessen the burden of high property pricing (increasing the number of public housing, cutting redtape on construction, ect).

The problem with Brand is that he chooses the easy path, cynicism without regard for the difficult choices that have to be made. I don't begrudge Brands decision to live in London or live in the property of his choice, but he doesn't seem willing to understand or even to acknowledge that it is people like him (ie; the pretty wealthy) that is often driving London's very high prices.""

Brand is right in that there is a problem that exists but he fails to acknowledge to what might cause the problem in the first place, that there might not easy answers and generally plays on peoples cynicism rather than an actual desire to change things.

We won't necessarily damage him for the present by playing him so much, it's a concern for his future.  The idea is that at 19 your body is still very much developing.  I think it's much easier to overwork muscles that are still in a state of rapid development than it is ones that are in a more fully built state and very much used to the kind of demands that the game calls for.  Michael Owen is an illustration of this.  It might not affect Sterling now but if he starts having persistent muscle injuries in the future it could come down to them not properly developing from being constantly worn out at a younger age.

Even if protecting Sterling's future from less silly injuries isn't a concern, burning him out should still be.  He's looked exhausted for a long time now and his performances had really dropped off a bit until the second half of the Stoke match.  He could probably due with a nice week or two of rest and easy training to rejuvenate himself mentally and physically.  He's obviously not going to get that much time mid-season, but getting him a solid rest period could help him a lot.

He's not the best at attacking, but he's got great ability to play deeper. Mason and him are a great combination. I think he could be with us for a long time. He's close to being counted HG (I think next season he will count?) so completely on board with us keeping him for a while. I think he has a *very* high ceiling judging by the way this past year has been going for him. How high? I think he could be one of the best CM in the PL judging by his current course. Ever since his debut I've been on board with him. Many fans were saying drop him, actually I think he's one of our most consistent players last seaosn and hopefully this season. 

20 years old is extremely young for someone of his capability. He is 3-4 years behind his age skill wise IMO. I don't know who to compare him to, he's his own player in so many ways. He's the next Bentaleb, his own player. I hate comparisons tbh. Hopefully injures don't slow his progress.

Let's talk national team. Algeria I think can become the biggest power house African team. I have them winning AFCON, and I really hope Bentaleb goes. Is club important? Yes.

That's totally ahistorical and it completely ignores the role of Western foreign policy in creating conditions which enable multinational corporations to offer the best available working options in parts of the developing world.  Often capitalist governments and companies have driven out less corrupt and more progressive developing world governments which were engaged in creating locally-oriented economies, social safety nets, fair taxation systems and land redistribution plans by employing dirty tricks propaganda and negative PR, providing massive funding for pro-corporate opposition candidates, using destabilisation strategies including black ops and sometimes offering naked aggression and engaging in attempts at regime change.  They've then replaced them with rapacious and corrupt borderline fascist/authoritarian juntas or dictators.  

Many millions have died to make the world safe and profitable for Western multinationals, and there is plenty of evidence in the public domain that this was the intention and little thought and few shits were given for the number of deaths or that it would end up making sweatshops and prostitution seem like good options in many parts of the world...

mason for one, is the only one capable of passing the ball forward. paulinho and dembele are horrible passers, they have zero vision. this is CENTRAL MIDFIELD we are playing. if you can't pass the ball in this league, then you are in trouble. 

he doesn't offer anything going forward? are you kidding me? what does dembele offer? the ability to dribble past one player and ponderously spend 5 minutes trying to figure out whether he should pass it or dribble into another blind alley? 

have you not noticed how much quicker our tempo is since Mason has come in? how much better we are moving the ball forward? did you not notice how for the past year or so how slow and pedestrian our midfield has been? 

mason is nowhere near modric, never will be, modric is one of the best in the world however he is the type of midfielder we have been crying out for since modric left. he finds those pockets of space.

i can't believe after all the evidence showing just how bad dembele and paulinho have been for our midfield your argument is still they are simply better then Mason, simple as that. no, they are not. mason in his first full PL season has already settled in and looks like he is a seasoned veteran. not to mention he doesn't shirk out of tackles, he isn't a bottle job.",0,1417475410,null,0,false,0,cmibpeb,t3_2nz88y,t1_cmibpeb,t1_cmib0tn,null,1425733020,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Yes, it's an extreme form of pornography, which is precisely why it has so many rules, restrictions and regulations. People take that shit seriously. *Nothing* is done without consent. People who produce, participate and otherwise engage in BDSM play take consent extremely seriously... this includes the production of pornography. Actors and actreses are given safe words. If those safe words are used, everything stops. Immediately. Whoever the person being whipped is, they have the power to say: ""Okay, stop. I've had enough."" If they say that, it's what has to happen. Otherwise - yes, some laws are being broken right there.

BDSM is also stupidly common as a fetish. It's practically mainstream. Most people are okay with just being handcuffed to a bed, but it's a *huge* spectrum that can go right up into bodily mutilation territory (hence why it can be considered an extreme fetish). 

Outlawing BDSM porn is only a bad thing. It should be done in broad daylight, not in some illegal basement setting somewhere. It should be respected.

I'm not even that crazy about BDSM... I'm just annoyed because I have been interested in it very deeply in the past and I like to think I understand the culture a little bit. Consent, trust and responsibility are of the most paramount importance to these people, whether they're doing it in the privacy of their bedrooms or involved in BDSM porn production.

&gt; Im assuming then that the numbers of non white non Catholics in Dublin are very low.

If you are talking about heritage then it probably is about 50% of the immigrants. A rough guess would be 15% Anglophone , 30% African, 15% Europe West, 25% Europe East, 10% East Asian and 5% West Asian.  I wouldn't really feel anything if those number grew as long as their were no enclaves.

I guess maybe because Britain had immigration over 50 years ago this caused the issue we see today in London and other places whearas Ireland was a more mature society when Immigration really became a topic (early 21st century.)

Also Dublin's rent price and our phobia of high rise means it is literally take where you can for immigrants. I know there are 2 bed flats with 7 people and 7 nationalities living in them.

As I said earlier, if we're going to ban HIV+ people from coming here then we're going to have to remove multitudes more, including: elderly people, smokers, obese people, diabetics, many people with mental health issues etc; this rabbit hole runs very deep. UKIP is always saying how they want the best and most skilled immigrants from around the word, but this completely flies in the face of that assertion, he would be willing to prevent a skilled nurse or tradesman from entering the UK simply due to their HIV status. If these bans were put in place, then we'd lose out on many skilled and talented migrants simply due to their health issues or their age.

&gt;People would be required to earn about £42,000 to pay enough in tax just to cover their HIV treatment

No they wouldn't. The average cost of HIV treatment per person is 18K a year, which would he picked up by the NHS, not the indivual themselves. The whole point of the NHS (i.e socialised medicine) is that people who can't afford Iife saving treatment are helped by the tax payer and the government to pay the bill, people with HIV are no exception. As long as an immigrant has paid £15 in taxes in a year; they've already paid for their treatment. The reason why Nigel Garage made this statement about people with HIV as opposed the elderly or overweight/obese people or someone with diabetes, is because such statements would alienate their core voter base; whereas HIV sufferes seem to be fair game.

false,JayCartwright,lfcflame,,"There are a lot of interesting quotes from this article, other than main point of the club offering him the coaching role.

&gt;There is no possibility that he would sign for another English club, but a move abroad is conceivable.

I wonder if he is thinking of doing something like Xabi and going to the likes of a Bayern or Madrid for one final crack at a league title, albeit in a smaller role than he has at Liverpool. I certainly wouldn't begrudge him it, god knows he has more than earned it, but I could definitely see many giving him grief about it.

Also could mean he is thinking of a move to a ""retirement league"" like the MLS or A-League. I saw a complete hear-say rumor somewhere that Beckham really wants him as his Miami team's marquee signing, but again, most likely completely made up. I'm conflicted about this option because while it would be cool for Americans like myself to get an opportunity to see Stevie in the MLS, I would much rather see him finish his career at Liverpool.

&gt;Gerrard has too much respect for Liverpool to join another Premier League club, so if he does move on it will be to a foreign team. There will be no shortage of offers.

&lt;3

As mentioned above, if he does decide to move on, it will be really interesting to see who goes in for him. 

&gt;Gerrard will return to Liverpool’s starting line-up for the Premier League trip to Leicester City on Tuesday night.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BLOW UP BETWEEN HIM AND RODGERS?!?!? THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE END OF HIM AT LIVERPOOL!!!! The English press really do suck major ass.


In summation, Stevie has a big decision on his hands to make. He has to choose whether he wants to remain a one-club man for the rest of his career, but face waning impact and playing time or move on and maybe be a central figure somewhere else before coming back to Liverpool in a coaching or ambassadorial role (which I think is pretty much a guarantee).

The competition in its older format shared its name with the trophy, being also known as the *European Cup*, before being renamed for the 1992–93 season onwards.

&gt;Several different physical trophies have had the name, as a club was entitled to keep the cup after five wins or three consecutive wins, with a new cup having to be forged for the following season.

That's something really great about or youth at the moment- all three of Bentaleb, Mason and Kane are cool as cucumbers.

3) When I finally get to a stage where I know where I want to settle down and buy a place of my own, sell the rental place and use that as a deposit, plus a good credit history.

It'll have been a good investment of my £30k and moved me forward.

That's not good enough for a striker,  So should we think of him more as an attacking midfielder? If you do that, he's not good enough to compete with Silva and Nasri.

So?

Who says? As I say, it's not a fleshed out policy yet, there's no saying that it couldn't have exemptions for those who earn a certain amount. We already limit extra-EU immigration based on earnings.

Umm, tiny is a subjective judgement, numbers aren't, don't try and conflate the two. I pointed out that the cost to the UK of treating HIV is about £920 M per annum. That's about £9k per sufferer. I consider that to be a fairly large number personally.

Here's some of the thought it's provoked in this reader: I have very mixed feelings about the value of going back to fix things (and in your poem, I take it that the one person who *can* do that is still mulling over the question himself).  First, the consequences of the past ""mistake"" (good, bad, and unintended -- and there are always unintended consequences, are now at least partially known, in hindsight.  A ""corrective"" fix would also have good, bad, and unintended consequences, and who's to say the ""bad"" wouldn't be even worse than the ones we've got now? 

Second, if you can go back and fix things, then nothing anyone does has any significance -- because it can always be cancelled by a time travel ""fix"" and replaced by something else.  I think we make choices all the time in what we do, and the consequences can go on teaching us the meaning of our past choices for years after -- and that's what brings the wisdom that we have intelligence and long life to pursue.  Does anyone have the right to cancel others' original choices and consequent learning?

Does anyone have the right to simply *erase* the time-tapestry woven of the interaction of the myriad choices of so many people/beings, and start a whole new tapestry by changing the selection of colors?  Which Greek philosopher said, ""You can't step into the same river twice""? I'd go further: you probably shouldn't *try* to step into the same river twice.

First of all, you chose to exclude the obvious less transient consequences that sex can have.  A baby is at least 18 years for the mother or father, let alone the lifelong disadvantage any such child would have from being born to unprepared parents.  If someone can't make competent decisions about things which you claim will affect their future careers and social standing, why on earth should they be able to make decisions that affect some other being's life prospects?  Not to mention the handful of incurable STDs they can pick up.

Second, you're framing the other half in a ridiculously exaggerated way.  Who said anything about 'starting a career in porn'?  All we're talking about is making a recording of someone having sex.  It may never be published, and even if it is uploaded to (say) YouPorn and is seen by a few hundred people, that is hardly life-ruining.  That covers 99% of cases.  What you're talking about is a tiny minority.

Even if we do take the edge case of someone making a poor decision and 'getting into porn', I fail to see how they can be considered competent to literally rule every aspect of a child's life and yet not to manage their own in this way.

I've said it before and I'll say it again Joel is good if you put your confidence in him. When he first came Wigan fans were positive he'd take the first choice from Howard within the season because they'd seen him play and how good he was. His only negative is his punching which I'm perfectly fine with as long as it doesn't end up in the back of the net. Unfortunately though Howard is relatively undroppable because of the backlash the club would receive and honestly I don't think Roberto is (this sounds very harsh but I don't know any other way to put it) not man enough to drop him. I'd say Distin this year was the first time I'd seen Roberto properly drop a player due to form and Distin was playing consistently shocking. It's the same with subs, I can't recall him making a sub based on how the person has played seems more like regardless how you play he has the subs planned out already which isn't always a negative. Also with Distin's dropping it was claimed he was ""injured"" which lets be honest we all know was probably bullshit. Anyway I honestly think we should give Joel a fair chance because really Howard's cost us more points this year than he's worth and I guarantee had Joel made half of the mistakes he'd be never allowed to show his face for the club again.

I'm thinking of Zen-style acceptance, in which you do as little as possible with whatever powers you have because a perfect world requires no action; or, when the spirit takes you, you do whatever appeals to you at the moment with your powers, since in a perfect world your action (or inaction) is already by its nature part of perfection and therefore perfect, itself, for the moment and situation in which it occurs.

* grade 12 = age 17-18 (last year of secondary education).
* **grades A, B, C, D** --- in the US, schools give everyone a ""grade"" in each subject at the end of each year (this is purely internal to each school).  Such ""grades"" have much more importance than similar assessments in UK schools.  A is best; D is the worst passing grade.

Ancelloti does not play with a DLP, he plays with a double pivot. We are splitting hairs, so I dont understand why andrew was unequivocally opposed to my view of him being B2B. 

The only reason im making this argument is because I remember when there were metro rumors of Banega or Pirlo coming to spurs, half the subreddit jizzed themselves over getting this idealized deep lying playmaker that is the answer to our problems. There are lots of strategies to win matches, and just because Modric carried our team during his time here doesnt mean we need a DLP.

I've always had the opinion of a DLP sitting deep to distribute the ball while getting forward to play through balls at times also helping out on the defensive end, possibly as part of a double pivot next to a more defensive player. 

Gerrard's job is supposed to be a deep lying playmaker IMO, helping out distributing the ball while also shielding the back four, he just sucks at the second part. Pirlo sucks at defending also, Conte at least paired two defensive mids with him to allow him to do his job.

Its hard to define roles at times because some systems have players that can do multiple roles. If I were to define Ancelloti's system, I would say that both Kroos are playing as DLPs, with Kroos being the more defensive of the two. I don't really like the box to box role to describe Modric either because a box to box mid is supposed to get in the box and score IMO. Players like Paulinho and Vidal who run into the box from deep to try to get on the end of crosses are perfect descriptions of this to me. Modric doesn't both getting in the box. He'll sit on the outside and spread it around and that's what a DLP is to me, even if he is in a double pivot.

false,MadArend,num20,,"In a lot of cases, Kane didn't make the pass because other players' movement into space either: 1) didn't happen, 2) happened too late, or 3) was ineffective.

On a number of occasions, Kane took on defenders, drew them to him to make space for others, but then found there was no one else making a run for him to pass to.  On other occasions, others were made runs but the runs did not make them available (for instance, Soldado running parallel to the CB at almost no angle to Kane, making it impossible to get him the ball).  There was at least one occasion when he took a shot (and not a bad shot, mind) because Soldado made his run too late, and Kane was forced to either shoot it or lose it; better anticipation from Soldado would have meant Bobby would have been 1v1 with the keeper with space to shoot, and you can see that Kane was looking for him but he wasn't open.

For sure, there were also times (once in the first half, and at least two in the second half, not including the time-killing stuff) where he didn't pass and could have.  How much those were influenced by all the other times when he didn't actually have the viable option, who knows.

He did make the wrong choice sometimes, but not as much as you make it out to be.  And overall, he did it less than Lamela often does, and created more with his dribbling than Lamela usually does.  Lamela has produced a few shots and of course the Rabona, but he actually has created very little with his dribbling.  He's been much more dangerous when he plays a quick and ambitious pass that finds a teammate in space.  

Kane, on the other hand, has created a lot of chances (and better chances than Lamela has) with his dribbling.  Kane's power has been more effective than Lamela's trickery.  In some ways, Lamela is more like Eriksen and Kane is more like Dembele in terms of the threat they pose.  Except, of course, Lamela is a better dribbler than Eriksen and Kane's a better passer than Dembele.  But I could argue that they're all on a spectrum:

Dembele------Kane-----Lamela---Eriksen

In fairness, though, Lamela has looked better of late, because he's been bringing more strength, shielding the ball more effectively, etc.  He's not a weak boy, and when he really starts marrying his strength and not-too-shabby pace to his tricks, he'll flat out destroy people.

The difference in the levels of criticms stems from the fact that even if they have similar downsides to their dribbling game, Kane has offered more upside.  You have to take the bad with the good, and Kane has provided more of the good, so people are more accepting of the bad.  When Lamela starts producing more chances and goals with his dribbling, people will be more inclined to say, ""Yeah, he dribbled in the defense and lost the ball, but that's fine because a lot of times when he does that we get goals.""  Which is what people are saying (or implicitly thinking) about Kane.

As for Sonupe and Coulthirst l, I haven't seen enough of them. Coulthirst is built and could do quite well as a target man. Sonupe is of the Raheem Sterling model and if he develops could be equally as useful for us as Sterling is for Liverpool.

Furthermore, Vertonghen, for the first time since two years ago was bombing forward and joining the attack - something he couldn't do without a more conservative Left back and solid centre back.

In - Box to box midfielder. I could see someone in the mold of Khedira coming in, though I am not sure who it would be. We have Ramires, but we are hitting the main stretch of games and we will need depth in the midfield to keep Matic and Cesc fresh for the long haul.

They're usually depicted as stuck-up, conservative types though, afraid of damaging space-time. So what they usually do is make sure things play out as they're supposed to, rarely interfering. The Doctor is infamously a renegade Time Lord because he tries to save people and change things for the better. Occasionally he'll talk about fixed points in time that he can't change, but he's usually all for improving the Universe, so I guess you could say that's his purpose.

Companions falling in love with him is pretty recent. In the classic series he was more of a grandfather figure than he is now (although Capaldi's bringing that side of him back). Grace Holloway in the 1996 TV movie was the first companion to kiss a Doctor. It was part of an attempt to Americanize the show for a new generation.

As for philosophy, it's unashamedly liberal in its views. The focus is on ethics. There are many LGBTQ characters in New Who. There's a deep respect for all life (the Doctor often sees creatures which other characters are disgusted by as beautiful).

3) Refute is the wrong word ""to prove (a statement or theory) to be wrong or false; disprove."" Deny is probably the word they wanted to go for.

When you mentioned ""Americanizing"" the show, it reminded me of something else.  This is the first non-American show I think I've watched, and even without the accents, I'd know it was ""foreign.""  There have been two instances of the show depicting modern American news/events, and both times have been... off.  :-)  The first time was during the Christmas invasion episode.  The show aired a clip of an American TV news anchor, and she said something like, ""The secretary-general has said to watch the skies.""  First of all, I have never heard the phrase ""secretary-general"" without it being followed by ""of the UN"" or ""of the United Nations.""  I think that there are probably a lot of Americans who would have no idea what the title ""Secretary-General"" refers to.  Second, I don't know that we care that much about what the Secretary-General has to say.  Now, if she had said, ""The *President* has said to watch the skies,"" that would be different.  But we don't really care about what any world leader thinks or says except our own.  ;-)

The second instance was during the third season finale, when President *Elect* Winters or whatever was killed.  The President-Elect would not be the one to make a public address on an event of this magnitude - he's got no legal authority to do anything.  Where was the *actual* President?

Overall, the best way is probably to start with the Big Finish main range adventures first, however, you should be aware that these are far closer in style to Classic Who, and it isn't until we get to the *Eighth Doctor Adventures*, featuring Lucie Miller, that it changes gear into something closer to NuWho, so you may be happier just starting there with *Blood of the Daleks*, and then going back to fill in the rest when you're hooked. However, to do the lot in a non-spoilery order, something like this would work:

Storm Warning  
Sword of Orion  
The Light at the End – which was BFs 50th anniversary tale – fits here, and if you want to include this huge multi-Doctor tale, this is the place to do it, but it’s pretty independent if you don’t.  
The Stones of Venice  
Minuet in Hell  - often considered the worst of these tales. It gets a LOT better.

Invaders From Mars  
The Chimes of Midnight  
Seasons of Fear  
Embrace the Darkness  
The Time of the Daleks  

Neverland  
Zagreus - this is epic. You will either love it or hate it. The nest few include a a couple of stinkers though. Again, keep going, it's worth it.   
Scherzo  
The Creed of the Kromon  
The Natural History of Fear  
The Twilight Kingdom  
Faith Stealer  
The Last  
Caerdroia  
The Next Life  

Terror Firma  
Scaredy Cat  
Other Lives  
Time Works  
Something Inside  
Memory Lane  
Absolution  
The Girl Who Never Was  

The Company of Friends – These are actually scattered around Eight's timeline, but it easiest to include here. The Key one is *Mary’s Story*, which, together with the next three tales actually occur before all of the above, but there are minor spoilers, so it's best to leave them until this point.  

The Silver Turk  
The Witch from the Well  
Army of Death  

And now we change pace with the *Eighth Doctor Adventures* sets:  
Blood of the Daleks  
Horror of Glam Rock  
Immortal Beloved  
Phobos  
No More Lies  
Human Resources  

Dead London  
Max Warp  
Brave New Town  
The Skull of Sobek  
Grand Theft Cosmos  
The Zygon Who Fell to Earth  
Sisters of the Flame  
The Vengeance of Morbius  

Orbis  
Hothouse  
The Beast of Orlok  
Wirrn Dawn  
The Scapegoat  
The Cannibalists  
The Eight Truths  
Worldwide Web  

Death in Blackpool  

An Earthly Child - a separate story that you need to listen to before the rest, but best fits here.

Plus he could still slot in on the back past which if you have Eriksen cutting in centrally, which is where we want his passing and shooting abilities, he would be cutting in on his strong foot and could use his strong foot to make those precise pass. I know Eriksen is very competent with his week foot but it helps to have that little bit of extra touch available on the strong. His components with his left foot at crossing also allows him to provide width. It would be great to see Soldado catch fire the team in general seems really passionate right now and I think we might catch a run of good form and Soldado could ride that team form into personal success.

That may well be the case and there are a few points to address here: 1. the money may be used for heroin but if they are an addict they actually need it or a substitute or they may die from withdrawal. 

2. If they're an addict they're probably going to find a hit one way or another. If they need money they may well rob somebody, who will they rob, they vulnerable. If we can avoid that then better for everyone. 

3: By talking to people we can better understand their needs. I never said everyone should give them money, I said that first and foremost people should stop and talk to them. One of the biggest challenges is having so many people ignore you and treat you like crap all day. Just a short conversation can make a big difference.

Cameron's approach is probably more accurately known as ""The Fallacy Of The Middle Way"" political argument.

It's attempting to reconcile both sides to a 3rd way that seems more plausible and hence more popular. From that point of view you may not appreciate that by appearances it sounds ""risky"" but the closer to a referendum the ""safer"" it appears to become.

false,DocOccupant,null,null,"This might help:  The BBC doesn't commission shows more than a year or two in advance.  Under most circumstances, contracts are for about a year (or roughly 12 episodes).  As a consequence, actors can leave pretty abruptly and this means the show is always changing in some respect.

Classic Who is a little more stable, and if you really want a sense of continuity you could try watching the Pertwee and Baker eras.  The show changes a lot in that time, too, but you'll have a couple of relatively long lived actors in the role.

In New Who, the Doctor has returned to his roots as an unashamed tourist.  He's basically a British gentleman on an extended tour of the entirety of time and space.  There's a certain amount of morality - don't solve your problems with violence when you can use intelligence, talk to people, have some basic respect for life in all its forms, don't judge people based on preconceptions - but where Star Trek used to be a weekly morality play, Doctor Who is nothing like that and was never intended to be.

I have to disagree with m'medical colleague u/DoctorJello about the Time Lords.  They don't get involved with the universe, they generally just observe, and they have reasons for this but those reasons aren't necessarily about letting things play out as they should.  They tend to limit their involvement in the universe to emergencies - patching things up when other people have torn dirty great holes in causality, for example and yes, Rose Tyler, I *am* looking at you - but they aren't in charge of anything.  Very deliberately, they aren't in charge of anything.  Which in itself is interesting: the most powerful civilisation in the universe and they don't want to run the place.  Is that morality?

The Doctor does have a family.  He's currently unsure what's happened to them.  Based on where you are in terms of stories, he's the only survivor of a war that destroyed his home planet and killed every single other Time Lord.  Understandably, he's not going to settle down and start a family with a random timelordoid alien for various reasons (biology, lifespan, still has all of time and space to see, has committed multiple genocide and is still working on getting his head around that).

Companions falling in love with The Doctor is a relatively recent development.  Sarah Jane's feelings about The Doctor in part stem from the fact she didn't choose to leave.  She got dropped off and didn't really get a farewell.  Essentially, she got dumped.  Companions in the classic series tend to fall in love with other people and move on (sometimes at very short notice), or have other reasons to leave.

The companions are perfectly able to talk about what they've seen, but no one's going to believe them.  

In the end, you'll either decide that this is a show you want to watch or it isn't.  If you decide to continue, you've got about another 47 years worth of assorted media (books, audio plays, video games) to discover and enjoy and you can dip into that huge resource as you see fit.

I'm with you that all the wars America/UK have fought even since WWII have been unjust wars. In an imaginary world where there's a sudden revolution, I don't think the average soldier should be tried for war crimes, but the higher ups definitely, because they know what they are doing.

Using the Catholic just war doctrine it's clear that Afghanistan/Iraq is unjust. Even if you're not Catholic I think these four points still make a lot of sense and can be taken for what they are:

1. the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
1. all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;
1. there must be serious prospects of success;
1. the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.

What we have now are ideological wars. Taliban might be fighting for Islam, British are fighting for the ideology of Britian. Both are committing acts that they wouldn't outside of warfare (and from the perspective of Taliban, terrorist acts are acts of war and not terrorism).

I don't see it this way myself, but I don't see how it's blinkered or narrow minded at all. It's a legitimate opinion. Of course, there are people in the army who are not even fighting at all on a day to day basis, but they are still part of the machine working towards that specific goal so it's not unfair to say that even if they don't pull the trigger they are still complicit in any killing (whether of someone who is innocent or not).",0,1417510155,null,0,false,0,cmiq9qp,t3_2nzj9m,t1_cmiq9qp,t1_cmiq3ik,null,1425723763,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I was in my 30s and my brother-in-law caught me leaning forward to squint at his dashboard which was only four feet away and ordered me to get an eye test.


&gt;What was your experience with shopping for frames?

I went to an [expensive shop](http://www.davidclulow.com/) after giving up on the cheaper ones (I didn't like anything, what a surprise) and spent £380 on both frames and lenses. [This](http://www.designerglassesboutique.co.uk/brand/134/face-face.aspx) is the brand I chose. I guess this was five years ago? I took a friend to help me choose. I have astigmatism, which I'm told means I have rugby ball shaped eyes or something. It's not that bad in comparison to a lot of people's though, something like -1.75 / +2.25, so I can still see without them, just don't ask me to read things far away (or indeed close up) and things don't have very sharply defined edges. 

It's always a good idea to take an honest friend with you to these things as what you think looks good on you will differ hugely from what actually does in reality.

As an aside, if you get a 'buy one get one free' offer, make sure you go for a spare set that are indestructible, rather than pretty and poncy as I did. I now have no spare set to wear (foot to metal accident) when mine are sent off for new lenses, which takes up to seven days because, idk, fucking astigmatism and special superhero glasses coating or something.

In terms of the fit, most opticians can adjust glasses, but you'll want to make sure they fit both at the sides (and don't painfully squeeze your head, which is a thing) and on the bridge of the nose. The best way to check these is to hang your head down and shake it like a rabid dog with a bone; if they don't budge, you have your perfect fit. Mine neither move much nor pinch.

false,hyp-R,lfc99,,"**Speculation of SG contract - rumours of moving abroad.**

*BR: Latest is that he's been offered a contract and that's where it's at.*

**GJ has been said he's not been offered a contract.**

*BR: Between club and his reps - between them - how far down the line that is, we aren't sure. Have spoken with GJ about it and just concentrating on his game.*

**Any progress on JH contract?**

*BR: Talks are on-going with the club and his representatives. No update.*

**When you spoke in Bulgaria about moments that change a season did you see those on the weekend?**

*BR: Was very pleased, was playing against a good side with a good manager, players produced a good result during a week. We got home late during the week and didn't have optimal recovery time. Hopefully we have turned the corner with our performance levels.*

**Gulf between CL and Championship is getting harder to bridge.**

*BR: Spoke about Nigel Pearson and how well he has been doing. Spoke about their players and how well they have been doing. Said we need to keep our momentum.*

**Pearson has been saying that managers receieve a lot of pressure that's uncalled for (relating to Pardew, Rodgers)**

*BR: It's all part of the job. Just focus on the football and improve the players. My responsibility to get results for the team. I have a group of players with strong spirit.*

**Steven's Situation: Not about number of games but level of games. Last weekend we compared to Frank Lampard's situation - is this about tailoring his matches and training to get the most out of it?**

*BR: No matter how well a player is once they get close to their final years we need to look at getting the best out of them. SG's history was, if not still is, one of the best players. World class talent.*

**Mark said that this is the first manager that has had to manage SG on the down rather coming up in his career, is that a fair assessment?**

*BR: No, I think this is just the part of managing the period of his life that he is in. I see him in games and I see the qualities he has, but it's the time of his life and career that reaches ever player, every top player, it's just my job to manage it. No issue. We speak a lot and we are as honest with each other as possible. He deserves it. He's going to be a key player for me for my time here.*

**You said that reports regarding SG and a rift has upset you - can you clarify is there any rift or difference of opinion?**

*BR: No - 150% No. I think Steven made a point on social media to say so too. We have a fantastic relationship and a huge amount of respect for him as a player and a person of what he does.*

**There's quite a deal of transfer spending on the bench - a lot of talk about the committee and transfer situation - are you disappointed with the transfers or content with the situation?**

*BR: It takes time - a lot of players came in - takes time to adjust. These are good players in their own right but htey have been deemed to be able to help the club in the coming seasons. Over the past 2 performances you can see we are very much together. Players will get the opportunity to play. The squad is very focused, very committed.*

**A question about confidence that I couldn't hear properly**

*BR: Spoke about our levels being low, but new players will get opportunities to show in training every day. Players are working very hard.*

**Lucas hasn't received much game time - he came back in for a few matches - great qualities he possesses - why's that?**

*BR: I went for the holding midfield player in SG who can also attack with passing. I felt his quality could exploit it. The dynamic of that has changed so I needed to rethink the structure. We needed to look at a different type of midfield player to come in. Lucas has came in and been excellent, great credit to him, works very hard.*

**Because you swept so many teams aside last season do you think teams know how to grind out a win against you now?**

*BR: It's just a different way to win, there's been a change here in terms of our team, we haven't had a great deal either (injuries, last minute goals) we could have recieved another 4-5 points from games we could have. We could have easily been in the top 4. I want to arrive in the second part of the season strong.*

**Squad question - anyone coming back?**

*BR: No, squad will be much the same. Sakho trained with the team for the first time in awhile but won't be match ready. Mario is still not fit.*

What normal Jewish person is actually upset by this? Should we ban Dad's Army because it portrays Frazer as the stereotypical tight fisted Scot?

The offence only comes into it because it can be construed as a negative stereotype. 

Surely it is only a negative stereotype if you are a Medieval Catholic with a belief that usury will send you to hell and damnation? Even the Vatican has a bank now, I guess people realised a while ago that the Jews role as a money lender in Medieval Europe was something worth borrowing. We wouldn't have even had the renaissance if non-Jewish Europeans hadn't started to lend money and charge interest.

A manager would get fined if he made comments regarding the referee's impartiality, so I'm not surprised babel was fined too.

The result and power of that sort of tactic means that you need a *tremendous* amount of capital to compete in the entry-level market; anyone looking to compete with Ford and make a direct profit in the field will need to keep up with the enormous economy of scale *and* accept very, very small profit margins in order to keep the price even remotely competitive.

I don't know for certain that motorcycle companies do the same thing, given that the market is clearly different. The requirement to ride a 125 for most people maybe means you can still charge more for what is essentially less bike without putting people off.

Regardless, what's definitely true is that *most* people are still buying budget 125 motorcycles, because they don't intend to keep them for long. Having a large-scale manufacturing scheme, or really, really cheap labor, is essential unless you intend to go with the loss-per-bike thing I talked about above. I don't think that any of the UK businesses are large enough, basically, to compete in the 125 market.

The military isn't included, and I must admit that actually agriculture is worse that waste processing.

The army reports the highest *mortality rate* amongst the British armed forces of [65 deaths per 100,000 in 2013](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/295835/20140327_UKAF_deaths_National_Statistic_2013.pdf) which covers all deaths, not just work-related ones. If we say that land transport accidents, other accidents, and hostile action are all work related for the army, it may seem reasonable to attribute 48% of mortality to work-related incidents. This will be an overestimate, as it includes the risk of accidental death off-duty as well as on-duty. Can we use 40% as an estimate? If so, the work-related fatality rate in the army would be approximately 26 per 100,000.

With a fatality rate of 3.33 per 100,000 in 2013, waste processing is about 13% as dangerous as being in the army; agriculture is 34% as dangerous. Working in either waste processing or agriculture many times worse than the average across all workers (7x and 20x respectively), so while not putting their workers at as high a risk of death as serving in the armed forces, they are significantly elevated.",0,1417518514,null,0,false,0,cmirsfg,t3_2nzj9m,t1_cmirsfg,t1_cmirdcy,null,1425723054,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Rent an apartment on a higher floor to keep your utilities down - works for me! I live four floors up and the heat generated by everyone else's apartment generally keeps mine pretty toasty! Of course, it depends on the building. 

Aldi and Lidl are cheap, but there's great deals to be had at most supermarkets, including M&amp;S - lunch meat 3 for £6, chicken breasts 3 packs for £10 etc. It's pretty easy to plan your food budget, and there are plenty of nice places that won't break the bank if you want to eat out.

If you're into food, shop at the Castle Farmers Market on Saturdays and Stockbridge market on Sundays. If you like ale, the Stockbridge Tap is a nice local pub and for some reason seems to be around 30p per pint less than other places (at least it was when I was last there a couple of weeks ago!).

As I said somewhere else, its hard to compare exactly, does some soldier dying of heatstroke count as ""on the job""? I'd say so, he'd not be in 50c heat in full battle armour if he wasn't in the army.  
Similarly, does a bin man/farmer dying of pneumonia count? Hard to put that 100% down to their job (of being in the rain for a week straight in -3c) as it could be due to something else (though the job is incredibly more likely).  

So if we're counting heatstroke but not pneumonia, that's not fair. If we count every single farmer/bin man who dies of pneumonia, that's probably not fair either.

We aren't near the FFP wage cap. Like the article says, the cap was set at 12/13. We brought our wage bill down by nearly £500k/week in that summer by offloading 7 players, and since then we have restructured the existing players' salaries and replaced outgoing players Lescott, Garcia, Rodwell, Richards with players earning the same, or less - Mangala, Fernando, Lampard, Sagna. 

FFP is not a problem. We only spent £24m of the £49m cap this summer, and the Wage cap sanction was what the club always said it was, completely irrelevant.

But houses going up on the old chemical works site, which had been abandoned after massive contamination, requiring the entire site to be dug up to a depth of 12 feet, and new soil imported. There have even been some new builds on flood plains that have been flooded during construction.

I get where you're coming from, it sounds like making excuses for losing or whatever... and yes, football is a results business... but based on those performances, the signs are that results will come. To go back to the race analogy, if I can lead that race once, I can do it again. And next time I'll be careful not to trip and fall.

Don't get me wrong, I would rather we got results at the moment, too. And if the team keeps making the same mistakes over and over, I'll start to really worry. But so far...

R v Wilson (1996) 2 Cr App Rep 241 however was a heterosexual couple where they got away with it arguing for consent.

R v Brown appealed the case all the way up to the European court and in the case of Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v The United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 39 it was decided that no breach of Article 8 of the ECHR happened because it is up to the participating state to define the amount of physical or psychological harm that consenting adults can consent to.

Some of my favourites:
- Clifton Suspension Bridge - built by Brunel there is a beautiful view over Bristol and the Avon Gorge. It is also close to Clifton which has some great delis and restaurants but not much in the way of culture. There are some lovely walks at Ashton Court and Leigh Woods over the bridge if you want to get out of the city.
- Thali Cafe - cheap and cheerful indian food, make sure to book ahead. 
- Harbourside - lots of choice for food and also the M-Shed museum (about Bristol and its people) and the Arnolfini modern art museum. The Watershed is a fantastic cinema and creative space and there is an information point v close. Lovely walks along the old docks and Cumberland basin too. Close to the shopping areas at Broadmead and Cabot Circus. Park street nearby has some interesting independent shops and a classic bansky.
- Markets! Having lunch at St. Nicks market is a must. There are some good coffee shops nearby, e.g. Small St Espresso. Tobacco Factory market is fun but a bit out from the center.
- You could do a Graffiti tour, see some Bankys and check out the mural competition on Rupert Street near the center. 
- St George's have lovely classical concerts but there are numerous lively music spaces around Bristol. I'm not best placed to offer suggestions here.

The Lords found that ""where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him actual bodily harm in the course of a sado-masochistic encounter...the prosecution [does not] have to prove lack of consent on the part of B before they can establish A's guilt under section 20 or section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861"" by a majority of 3-2. 

Basically if you commit acts that equate to ABH (i.e. that leave marks - although the case states that none of the men were permanently injured) you can be prosecuted and do not have the right to use consent as a defence. 

However, the acts in R v Brown were deemed to be worthy of that:

""*The charges against the appellants were based on genital torture and violence to the buttocks, anus, penis, testicles and nipples. The victims were degraded and humiliated, sometimes beaten, sometimes wounded with instruments and sometimes branded.

1. I know it has entered Spurs 'lore' that it was Harry's behaviour during the England manager search that did him in but I think that was one of the reasons, not the only reason. I would add: (a) complaints about training methods, (b) clubs desire to maximise youth product through new facilities (c) I can remember our Cup shirt sponsor complaining about Redknapps approach in the cup, (d) his conduct during the transfer windows, (e) his ultimate desire to be an all powerfull manager like Ferguson/Wenger.  I think basically we were the last of the ""blue chip"" clubs willing to let someone as corporately insensitive as him loose with inevitable effects.

2. Section on AVB is far too harsh. I'm no AVB apologista but even I winced at the kicking he received. I think everyone at the club (fans, players, board) deserted him when things started to go wrong. He definitely made some mistakes though. Tbh, as a club we needed AVB to teach us how to treat a manager like Poch (my fingers are crossed here that we'll be patient).",0,1417523170,null,0,false,0,cmisq00,t3_2ny66x,t1_cmisq00,t3_2ny66x,null,1425722619,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

false,barejokez,null,null,"in finance/investment, there is a principle that states there are 3 stages of investment:

1. income.  If your investment produces a regular income that more than covers any costs (ie: your rent is higher than mortgage, tax, maintenance, agent fees, etc), then you have a fairly safe, stable asset.  the underlying price might go up or down, but as long as the above remains true you can expect to make money (and realistically you can also expect the price to rise long term as people chase this cash-printer).

2. speculative.  if the income more or less matches the costs.  You are more or less happy owning the asset, but you are exposed to shifts in the asset's underlying value, and rely on price increases to make profit on your investment.  this can still happen, especially with a long term view, thanks to inflation etc.

3. ponzi.  At this point the income from your asset is not covering your costs, and you are reliant on price appreciation just to break even.  Once the market reaches this point, the price WILL (sooner or later) drop, at least to stage 2, but often back to 1.  This can be seen to be true because sooner or later you or the next guy will fail to find a buyer at a higher price. People will realise that negative income is not worth paying for and the price will drop. 

There are numerous examples in the investing world that this can be applied to, but in my opinion property is one of the best ones.  Your proposal is an interesting one because your maths has already highlighted an issue that a lot of people ignore (because they think Buy-To-Let is easy), and once you do some more sums that include maintenance, periodic vacancy periods, tax, insurance etc you will probably have a sense of why i'm not investing in property for the foreseeable future. 

admittedly, you have included mortgage repayments in your calculation, which most people wouldn't do, but you should compare any returns you expect to make against those you can make for zero effort at santander.

one final counterpoint i will make is that you will always need a place to live, and so having exposure to the property market is not simply an investment decision.  if you are planning to sell this place to buy a home in a few years, then it's a much more personal decision, and one that only you can really make.",0,1417523784,null,0,false,0,cmisuzs,t3_2nz9nj,t1_cmisuzs,t3_2nz9nj,null,1425722555,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Under the Criminal Justice Bill passed in 2008 it was also included under the ""Extreme Porn"" definition which also includes;


An act which threatens or appears to threaten a person's life

An act which results in or appears to result in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals

An act which involves or appears to involve sexual interference with a human corpse

A person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal

Under that bill,  It is an offence for a person to be in possession of an extreme pornographic image.

Facts don't lie, but truncated graphs that don't show the whole truth do.

Extend that graph back to 2007 - it's less impressive when you see the massive dip that preceeded the 2009 climb out of recession rise. The bottom fell out the bottom of the market which crashed and then climbed back to near-2007 levels of growth all on it's own.

Moreover, if you look at the same graph for the [Euro Area](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/gdp-growth) it shows that despite their opposition to Osborne's Austerity, they're doing almost exactly the same as us with GDP Growth trending between 0 and 1% with odd dips below 0%. The only difference is that the UK tends to spend more time in the 0.5-1% bracket, whilst the Euro area spends more time in the 0-0.5% bracket.

Or for more examples, you could look at [France](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/gdp-growth) which has only dipped above 0.5% once since 2011 and regularly goes negative, or [Germany](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth) - who looked like they were onto something in 2010 when they said austerity was not the way forward and had growth tipping 2% - before crashing back to 0% and looking fairly dismal ever since.

The only thing you can credit Darling for is that the retraction in the UK's GDP maxed out at -2.25% whereas the Eurozone went down to 2.9%, but it's easily debatable whether that was thanks to Darling's hand on the tiller or just luck rather than judgement (or the fact we're not in the Euro giving Darling more latitude with respect to economic decisions than his European counterparts - latitude that Osborne would also have had).

The simple, *provable,*  fact is that whatever you think of Osborne, *no one else* (regardless of whether their policy is to increase public spending or embrace austerity) is doing any better. It's all very clever to post a load of graphs like the Guardian have done showing how we missed our targets - but without a control reference they are *meaningless*. It's no good berating Osborne for missing our targets if our biggest trading partners have also missed theirs - because Osborne has no control over them, and our economy is in no small part dependent on them.

I don't think he's made all the right decisions, I also don't think Labour would have done any better.

What it does is sequence a bunch of known SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) which are single base pair changes in your DNA, these are at known locations on your genes and have been associated in GWAS (genome wide association studies) to be linked with certain diseases, phenotypic traits (physical characteristics) and other things like ancestry across populations. Many of these populations are from long term studies, particularly Iceland, of anywhere between 10,000 to 100,000 people and if you log in you will also see Chinese and Nigerian studies. This must all be taken in to account when associations are made between a SNP and a link to a disease - which is where 23andMe somewhat fell over in America.

23andMe sequences about 0.3% of your entire DNA, exome sequencing does about 1-3% - AFAIK no one offers this commercially - and genome sequencing will do ~99% of your DNA which [this](http://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/) initiative offers if you have rare diseases or cancers.

I signed up for 23andMe before they got in to trouble in America when it was $99 USD - so the £125 is quite an increase in price - and I wouldn't really say it is worth it. The characteristics they tell you about your phenotypes are obvious and only confirm things you already know, some don't work - according to one SNP I am not a bitter taster whereas empirically I know that I am - and then the ""risk factors"" are based on populations and the population mean likelihood of having a particular SNP, so you get +/- % chance of having the phenotype from the SNP. Ancestry is also not really inciteful, unless you are adopted or estranged from your parents, having a Scottish father and an English mother it was no surprise I was 99% European and 76% British.

Its a shit idea. Your car has to be registered in the UK and issued a UK registration number. You'll need to change the brake lights, headlights and turn indicators to UK requirements - this needs to be done within 30 days. If your car is over 3 years old it needs to have a MOT test annually. If its under 3 years old it'll need a SVA test once you've converted the lights and then from 3 years old an annual MOT test. The MOT test is very strict and tests brakes, suspension, steering, emissions, bodywork, safety systems etc to a far higher standard than you have in the USA so if you don't maintain it that much or its a POS, leave it at home. 

Driving a left hand drive car in the UK isn't that easy on single lane roads and it'll drink fuel like a fish. At the equivalent of $7.38 a US Gallon you really don't want a low MPG vehicle. 

From the [DoD advice website for your base](http://www.militaryinstallations.dod.mil/pls/psgprod/f?p=132:CONTENT:0::NO::P4_INST_ID,P4_INST_TYPE:8,INSTALLATION):

Vehicle Registration

Vehicles imported into the country must be registered with the British authorities through the Pass and Registration office within 72 hours of being driven into the U.K or after being picked up from the port. A minimum of one Stateside license plate must be attached to the vehicle when picking it up at the port. (Don't forget to hand carry your front and rear license plates with you) all cars in Britain have front and rear plates. Upon arrival of your POV your plates will be put back on your car until your vehicle is fully registered in the U.K System and the British license plates can be made. Personnel without any plates on their vehicles are not authorized to drive the vehicle in the U.K. until the U.K. registration has been completed. U.K. light conversions are mandatory for every vehicle imported into the U.K. There is no exception to this regulation. Members are only allowed to drive their imported vehicles in the local area, with plate(s), for 30 days prior to the completion of the full U.K. registration. If your vehicle is not fully registered in the U.K. with British plates affixed to the front and rear of your imported vehicle within 30 days, your vehicle must be parked and may no longer be driven. There are no exceptions to this policy.

Vehicles three years or older must have a Ministry of Transport (MOT) certificate completed. A new requirement for vehicles less than three years old is the Single Vehicle Approval (SVA). The MOT and SVA are similar safety inspections. However, the MOT is an annual requirement for all vehicles over three years old being operated in the United Kingdom; and the SVA is a one time requirement on concession vehicles imported into the United Kingdom less than three years old. Once the vehicle is greater than three years old a standard MOT will be required annually.

Ministry on Transport (MOT) Inspection

The Ministry of Transport requires all imported vehicles that are less than three years old to be inspected before registration and vehicles over three years of age must be inspected yearly, this is called a Ministry Of Transport (MOT) Certificate. The MOT is a bumper to bumper safety test. It is very involved and complex and is not an easy test to pass. The MOT test itself takes about 45 minutes and the cost is currently £40-£50 or its dollar equivalent at the going rate. The MOT applies to all vehicles more than 3 years old. The MOT certificate is good for 12 months and then must be retested. You must have a valid MOT test certificate in order to drive on British roads. You may incur additional costs if the vehicle does not meet or pass MOT requirements and requires maintenance.

What should the guidelines be when deciding whether or not to bring an older vehicle to the UK?

The general rule is if you don't think your car will pass this test, it might be a good idea to consider the cost and length of time it would take to get the parts to repair it (generally from the States). A good rule of thumb is any car 10 years or older, unless a classic, would be best left in the States.

UK Law On Vehicles With Tinted Windows

Under UK law, the windshields of vehicles first used prior to 1 Apr 85 must allow at least 70% of visual light to pass through the glass. Vehicles newer than 1 April 85 must have windshields that allow 75% of visual light to pass through the glass and front side windows that allow 70% of visual light to pass through the glass. The rear windows of vehicles can be heavily tinted as long as the vehicle is equipped with side mirrors. The rules limiting tinted vehicle glass were implemented for two important reasons: first, to increase road safety by improving driver visibility, and second, to protect officers by giving them increased visibility into vehicles.

Requirements for the MOT testing include:

All vehicles built after 1 April 1981 must have a fog light, mounted at the rear of the vehicle, centered to the right hand side of the vehicle. Also, the light control switch must light up when the fog light is on and must be seen from the driver's seat.
Parking lights must be white, not amber.
The headlights in the UK are angled differently than in the States because of driving on the other side of the road. It is suggested that the re-aiming of your lights be done when you arrive in the UK.
All vehicles built after 1 April 1986 must have a side repeater. A side repeater is a separate turn signal in the fender that can be seen from the driver side door. In most cases this means drilling holes in the fender of approximately 3/4 inch. Wraparound lights may substitute for the side repeater in some models.
All rear turn signals must flash amber, and must not adversely affect any other light (brake light, parking light).
Very few American vehicles meet the standards for light requirements in the UK. The price for a light conversion can be very high depending on the vehicle.",0,1417526076,null,0,false,0,cmitgdg,t3_2nyrag,t1_cmitgdg,t3_2nyrag,null,1425722277,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Fracking in the US is probably going to turn out to be a commercial disaster (the 10K and 10Q forms of most companies involved in shale oil and gas aren't pretty reading), and given that it would be way more expensive here it seems unlikely to really take off in a big way.  The Bowland shale is quite highly faulted, so it might be a poor prospect anyway.  The recent collapse in oil prices is probably also going to make a lot of firms have second thoughts about it.  I reckon our nascent fracking industry will probably go the way of Polands, rather than Americas.

And, honestly, the odds of us squeezing a bit of gas out of some shitty source rocks and somehow lowering gas prices long term dramatically are close to nil.

As it is you have 15-25 year olds calling for a change of absolutely everything, and then you have 45-100 year old calling for a change of absolutely nothing. 

How about everyone be a bit more realistic in their demands. A revolution will not happen. Far too few people want one, far too many people are comfortable, so there'd likely be a civil war if it were ever attempted. 

This country is pretty damn comfortable in the grand scheme of things. It can be better, absolutely. But we're doing extremely okay on a global scale. 

So the best thing the young and politically active can do is pick a particular problem with the current system, and offer up a viable solution to that problem. Then campaign on changing that part of the current system. 

For example, changing from FPTP to PR. A clear goal, with a clear solution, with a clear point at which you can say 'we did it!' and move onto fixing the next issue.. 

It's painful to see such a waste of political might.

false,Carlswaen,null,null,"&gt;Just how much gas does Britain import from Russia?

&gt;The simple question is a complicated one to answer because of the myriad of pipelines and interconnections that tie together Europe’s energy industries and utilities. Created over the past couple of decades as part of a grand European project to roll back borders and liberalise markets, it was envisaged that cross-border pipelines would allow for the free flow of gas while providing long-term cheap supplies of energy for the region’s consumers.

&gt;In reality it has failed, and in the case of the UK it has created a situation where there is some uncertainty about where exactly the gas we import via a pipeline from Holland originates. Some reports claim Russia supplies 15pc of the UK’s gas and others suggest the country is currently importing none from Moscow’s state-controlled energy companies.

&gt;Even Britain’s largest utility, Centrica, doesn’t know how much of the natural gas generating our electricity and heating our homes is Russian. The company signed a deal in 2012 with the UK marketing arm of Russia’s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom for the supply of 2.4bn cubic metres of gas over three years. Reports on Friday suggested this gas was already being pumped into the country via the Dutch pipeline. However, a spokesperson from Centrica vigorously denied the rumour being spread by analysts to explain a sudden increase in volumes of gas flowing the through the pipeline, which runs under the North Sea.
According to Cenrtica, supplies from Gazprom won’t begin until October. The British utility is also at pains to stress that it doesn’t know whether the Russian company will import the fuel from its vast fields in Siberia, or simply supply gas it has bought on the open European market. If knowledge is power then Cenrica’s lack of information about where Britain’s gas will come from in the future is a concern.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10715674/Where-is-our-gas-coming-from-Centrica.html

Even Centrica won't support what you said.   All we have is specualtion because even the regulators don't know.   We do know we don't buy directly.

A deal was signed in 2012 to buy from Russia which was due to mature in October 2014, needless to say, things have hit a few bumps since then.

http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/uk-ukraine-crisis-energy-britain-idUKBREA2K16N20140321

What we do do is we buy from a European market via a Dutch pipeline, which in itself buys from Russia, but we have one degree of market separation.

For a more general, recent example, until a couple of months ago it could be illegal for someone to rip a music CD they owned to a computer or portable music player - that was generally considered nonsense and ignored. And Parliament finally changed it. But even then some people disagreed and are now suing the Government over the change. If they win their case it will go back to being illegal again.

There is a system in place for questioning nonsense laws; Parliament can change them, there's the public interest test for prosecutions, juries, human rights laws and the ability of courts to refuse to enforce them.

They finally get in to power and they pull out this draw of policies they have gathered over the years and start implementing - completely irrespective of the change in economic environment. To add kick to the boot, the IMF was on their side at the start, advising countries to implement austerity policy. A good number of years ago now the evidence supporting these claims entirely collapsed and IMF policy reversed. (I'll go out on a limb here, but my understanding is there is literally no evidence supporting austerity during a slump). The conservatives are now running on ideology and nothing else. They would lose the confidence of their voters if they U-turned on austerity and used evidence to support their decision. Since Margret Thatcher every conservative I speak to about tries to use a household as an analogy for the economy - they think reducing debt is the prudent thing to do, almost as if it is morally wrong to do otherwise. The lie has been so consistently repeated voters have been brainwashed of all critical thinking when it comes to the economy. The idea that public debt should finance investment is repugnant to most. Changing Conservative policy would require them admitting that they are/were on the wrong path - seemingly impossible for all stripes of politician, but it would also require telling their voter and supporters that they are wrong and their understanding of the economy is fundamentally incorrect. Instead the conservatives (or any party) should tell it like it is. Models (and analogies) of the economy are context specific; sometimes they 'work' sometimes they don't.

**The UK’s political currents are for turning inwards – the resistance is in the chancellor’s hands**

*By Janan Ganesh*

For Samuel Johnson, “the first Whig was the devil”. Eighteenth-century England’s great man of letters had a Tory love of monarchy and the established church. Whigs were proto-liberals who backed parliament and nonconformism. These ideals – order and freedom – still vie for command of the right.


George Osborne is the last Whig, or at least the last who matters. The chancellor of the exchequer, who gives his autumn statement on Wednesday, is nominally Conservative but he is not in politics to conserve things. He takes a liberal line on everything bar crime and national security. He is at ease amid the torrential flux of globalisation that increasingly unnerves western electorates. In Osbornia – a land ruled by him, unconstrained by public opinion – planning laws would be loose, taxes low and self-starting foreigners welcome. He is more romantic on the topic of personal freedom than his practised air of chilly cynicism has ever let on.

Before the crash, Mr Osborne’s liberalism did not matter because it was the common sense of the age. The world has changed around him ever since and suddenly Davos Man is lonely. Many Britons, even middle-class ones, feel the raw side of globalisation. The UK Independence party has become an electoral sensation by speaking for them. Ever-booming London, Mr Osborne’s home town, is resented by much of the country as a heathen blend of Babel and Gomorrah. Even David Cameron has the nostalgic streak of a rural Tory and his putative successor as prime minister, Labour’s Ed Miliband, wants the general election next May to end 40 years of liberal economics.


The chancellor made his name as a fiscal hawk but austerity is no longer the political story of the day. On Wednesday, he will repeat his commitment to reach budget surplus, not just balance, in the next parliament. He will spend money the country does not have on the National Health Service and hold out the prospect of tax cuts. That these aims are hard to reconcile will not stop the Tories going into the election with a better economic reputation than Labour. This owes less to their own patchy record of cutting the deficit than the economic recovery and Labour’s refusal to recant its own profligacy in office.


Austerity will continue for years but, as a point of political dispute, the main parties are now having to try like ham actors to keep it going. Both want the deficit gone by 2020 and both fudge the question of how to do it. There are nuanced differences, namely the Tories’ quicker timescale and Labour’s openness to borrowing for more capital spending. But voters grasp essentials and here is one: the age of public largesse ended in 2010 and will not return under any party any time soon.

The liveliest questions are now non-fiscal. Can Britain contemplate life outside the European single market? How far will it go to restrict immigration? Should it frack? Does it want to remain an aviation hub? Will it build homes or sanctify greenfield land? Should tax rates be set to reduce inequality or lure jet-setting talent? Do we regard London as our last global trump card or something to be tied down like Gulliver? Basically: is this still an open country?


Mr Osborne’s liberal take on these questions now matters more than his flinty view of how to run a budget, which is no longer so distinctive within Westminster, much less Europe. We are all deficit-cutters now. We are not all liberals. The few there are must assert themselves if Britain is not to turn away from the world in the coming years.


The burden is on the chancellor because his influence extends so wide and deep. Boris Johnson has similar instincts but, until he enters parliament in May, he occupies London’s underpowered mayoralty. The Tories’ 2010 intake of MPs are a modern bunch but years away from real eminence. Some Labour frontbenchers seem relaxed about globalisation – Douglas Alexander, the foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, the business spokesman – but they will not set the tone of a Miliband premiership. As for the Liberal Democrats, they have never earned the first half of their name.


Mr Osborne’s roaming interventions do not go unresented. Disappointed eurosceptics saw his restraining hand in Mr Cameron’s recent speech on EU free movement. Anyone who wants an open Britain should hope he throws himself around even more. The next government has to make decisions about this country’s receptiveness to the world that will ramify for decades. The political currents are for turning in. The resistance is in the chancellor’s hands – until such time as the London mayor shows him to be not, after all, the very last Whig.

True, but I'm not sure how much weight that point carries.  You could argue that it's the frequency or potential consequences of casing breaches during fracking for one, and, more tellingly again, the number of wells that are actually involved with the sort of multi-well-pad arrangements that fracking often brings.

&gt;the report on fracking by the QLD state government...If anything, Australia's experience with fracking is a good one - strong regulations, frequent inspections to identify issues to be corrected, and a boost for the local economy. 

Frankly, I wouldn't trust the Queensland State government any more than I would those parts of the US legislative and ""regulatory"" system which have greenlit the destruction over there, nor the extensively compromised government and ""regulatory"" commentators in the UK (where the industry and those with economic vested interests have managed to establish a considerable bridgehead of place men and women).  The independent scientific and medical community have by and large been very critical of the dumping of the precautionary principle in favour of private profits in this field.  And rightly so - the evidence on ecological and human health impacts is growing all the time and the studies which fail to show such relationships are often poorly designed or compromised in other ways.

Pointing out perceived stereotypes of a certain group of people such as; the Irish like a drink; American's are loud and obnoxious; the Scots are tight, drunkards and aggressive; the English are cold and racist; the Swiss are cold and racist; the Germans are cold, mechanical and racist; the Japanese are bat-shit crazy; the Russians are bat-shit crazy; the French are cowards; the Italians are loud and corrupt; the Spanish are lazy; the Greeks are gay and lazy; all Eastern Europeans are lazy benefit scroungers and/or criminals; the Arabs are misogynistic and crazy; and yes, the Jews have a penchant for money. 

None of this is in itself racist if you don't also believe that your race is superior to theirs! You could easily believe that, ""they are stupid but so are we. We are all stupid!""

At worst it could be libelous but you would have to prove that the author believed that 'grabbing coins' or liking money was a defamation of character. Perhaps you think it is virtuous or moreover, neutral! 

If the intention is comedy or satire, not defamatory at all, then not libelous either. 

It could also be argued that none of these types of stereotypes are actually libelous because they also have some truth to them, even though they may not be true of all of the stereotyped group (but seriously, what kind of idiot thinks that when one makes a generalization about a certain group of people that one actually thinks that generalization is true for all of those types?).

Even if their is no truth to them at all, is it wrong or illegal to hold a stereotype about a group of people that you yourself consider, just a thing, neither positive nor negative? 

One may perceive the assertion that the Irish like their beer is libelous but another may see this as virtuous. Many people think it admirable and praiseworthy that you like to make merry and that you can handle your alcohol.

One screamer against Norwich and coming close to scoring doesn't really change his goal scoring ability. He can obviously score, but his scoring rate isn't good enough. He also doesn't seem to get himself into position for easy chances either. Like last game where we spent most of our time outside of Sunderland's box, he stuck centrally and didn't make any runs or cuts. This is not just one game but he's done this a lot this season. Schurrle has been shit this season, but I've never seen Willian make runs like he does for the goals he's scored. The Fabregas assist against Burnley and the run against City were goals created by positioning. I haven't seen Willian do that consistently. 

I just feel like he doesn't contribute much on offense on this side of football.

Now what I see from these two sources, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that Centrica's and Gazprom's statements appear to contradict a bit.

So it could be that those figures are right as of October, but as the article states, Centrica ""doesn’t know whether the Russian company will import the fuel from its vast fields in Siberia, or simply supply gas it has bought on the open European market."" Is it not possible that the latter could be true, while the Gazprom (a Russian state-owned energy giant) website bends the truth slightly?

Degrading is a hard term to quatify, I know. Say for example in a good well made BDSM film, being a sub looks degrading. However in well made BDSM the dom would never do anything the sub hasn't agreed to, and will always stop when asked. Aftercare is also important, and in that respect the sub hopefully doesn't feel degraded. 

However in mainstream porn if you see the women asking for her partner to stop it probably won't happen, most of the examples of this are in the famous couch show or things similar. There's also the way how porn is all about the man's pleasure, that a woman just becomes a sex doll. Sex in a healthy relationship is about mutual satisfaction and porn doesn't show this.

Gas is generally bought in two ways, spot markets or long term contracts. The UK overwhelmingly buys gas on spot markets in Europe. Spot markets are those where you buy a commodity (such as gas, or coal, or gain) and can expect to receive it the next day or three days or whatever - the point is that it's a very short period of time. These prices fluctuate in price day to day depending on supply and demand, so every week you might be paying a different price.

The other way is long term contracts. In these the price and quantity are set beforehand for a period of weeks, months, or years. These are more stable, but if gas prices collapse then you may continue paying a higher price than what is available on spot markets. Conversely, if the gas prices drastically increase, you're buying cheaper gas than everyone that's buying it on spot markets.

Russian gas is flush through European gas markets, which is where the UK primarily buys its gas. It is rather difficult to determine the national origin of this gas, but if the UK is buying gas from European gas markets, it's getting some Russian gas somewhere. 

The gazprom website is talking about spot market gas - it estimates that around 12 billion cubic metres of gas that the UK buys is Russian gas. The Centrica deal is a long term contract, and does not represent all the gas that the UK buys from Russia. I'm sceptical of the Gazprom figures myself, but as the data is not publicly available of how much gas the UK actually gets from Russia, we have to judge by the sources that we have, and those sources are that Centrica had a contract in place to start receiving gas in October of this year, and that Gazprom sells about 12 billion cubic metres of russian gas to the UK. 

**Both of these contradict /u/wobblewagon's claim that the UK does not buy Russian gas**.

**tl;dr You can't sell video online that you couldn't sell in a sex shop. The new regulations hold VOD companies to the BBFC classifications.

Basically the [Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2916/pdfs/uksi_20142916_en.pdf) [PDF link] came into effect yesterday (Dec 1st). These state that:

&gt;An on-demand programme service must not contain any prohibited material

&gt;“Prohibited material” means—

&gt;(a) a video work which the video works authority has determined for the purposes of the 1984 Act not to be suitable for a classification certificate to be issued in respect of it, or

&gt;(b) material whose nature is such that it is reasonable to expect that, if the material were contained in a video work submitted to the video works authority for a classification certificate, the video works authority would determine for those purposes that the video work was not suitable for a classification certificate to be issued in respect of it

So no on-demand service can broadcast any programme that has either been refused classification by the BBFC *or would reasonably be expected to be refused classification*.

======

The BBFC's top classification level is [R18](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R18_certificate). I will quote a few pertinent sections from the [BBFC's guidelines](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/BBFC%20Classification%20Guidelines%202014_5.pdf) [PDF link]:

&gt;The R18 category is suitable for sex works containing clear images of real sex, strong fetish material, sexually explicit animated images, or other very strong sexual images. R18 video works may be supplied only in licensed sex shops which no one under 18 may enter. R18 films may be shown only in specially licensed cinemas.


&gt; **What is not acceptable for an R18:**

* material which is in breach of the criminal law, including material judged to be obscene under the current interpretation of the Obscene Publications Act1959

* material (including dialogue) likely to encourage an interest in sexually abusive activity which may include adults role-playing as non-adults

* the portrayal of sexual activity which involves real or apparent lack of consent. Any form of physical restraint which prevents participants from indicating a withdrawal of consent

* the infliction of pain or acts which may cause lasting physical harm, whether real or (in a sexual context) simulated. Some allowance may be made for moderate, non-abusive, consensual activity

* penetration by any object associated with violence or likely to cause physical harm

* sexual threats, humiliation or abuse which do not form part of a clearly consenting role-playing game.

* Strong physical or verbal abuse, even if consensual, is unlikely to be acceptable

BBFC will refuse to classify works containing any of the above (at their discretion, as this is quite subjective). Since online video providers now have to meet the R18 guidelines it means they cannot legally sell anything containing the above. I haven't found a specific list of sex acts like Vice have, but it's possible the BBFC have been more specific in the past (or Vice could be extrapolating based on what sorts of films are refused classification).

**EDIT: found a more comprehensive list on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R18_certificate#Regulation_of_content), but it appears to be based on a page that no longer exists on the BBFC's site. You can find references to fisting being disallowed in [this interview](http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2011/06/prime-cuts/) for example, as well as period-sex (?!) and urinating onto a person. It's also worth pointing out that since the [acquittal of Michael Peacock](http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/feature/2012-01-09-article-about-the-michael-peacock-trial-the-obscene-publications-act-and-what-it-means-for-cinema-feature-story-by-jane-fae) for distributing obscene videos the BBFC have admitted they need to decide how to proceed regarding classification of these acts.**

**EDIT 2: The new act applies to any 'on demand video service'. The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATVOD) for the ATVOD defines on-demand video services as anything that meets the following criteria**:

* The principal purpose of the service is the provision of programmes, and
the form and content of such programmes are comparable to those normally included in television programme services.

* The programmes are offered by the service ""on-demand"". That is, they may be selected by a user, and viewed at a time chosen by the user.

* The programmes are received by the user through an electronic communications network (including terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, cable network or via Internet Protocol).

* There is a person who exercises editorial responsibility in selecting and organising the programmes, and that person makes the service available for use by the public generally, and that person is under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom as defined by the AVMSD",0,1417532576,null,0,1417537768,0,cmivteq,t3_2nynmj,t1_cmivteq,t3_2nynmj,null,1425721175,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The argument that the UK buys from Russia is inherently flawed and used by some in a fear tactic to act as a cohesive around a fragmenting EU experiment.  'We're all in this together' style rhetoric - only we're not - and now that we have discovered such vast reserves of shale gas (and they are truly vast) we can be more independent than ever.

It is true that the UK had signed a deal in 2012, prior to the Ukraine/Crimea crisis and sanctions, to buy Russian gas but it was only due to come online now.  Prior to this the UK bought its gas from Norway, Qatar, Australia, Iran, Yemen, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Ghana, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States of America, but not Russia.

In fact UK, Norway, and the Netherlands are all long standing producers of gas and are immediately eligible as potential solutions to what is surely an energy crisis in those EU states that are heavily dependent on Russian gas.   

-------------------------

**It remains however that the UK was only ever due to START buying Russian gas this year.**

Careful with this, The burden of proof is placed on the owner or debtor, not the bailiffs. They have to take reasonable steps but it doesn't mean they couldn't seize the items if its ownership is unknown or questioned (in situations where debtors claim everything belongs to the other tenant of the property).

Ideally the op should move any high value items to his room, even with no locks the bailiffs will have to assume that the debtor is not the owner of the property in that room. Ideal situation would be that you collect together receipts for the high ticket items or mark them as yours in some way (e.g. anti theft mechanisms).

Also its worth noting, as many don't know or ignore it, for income tax debt HRMC can force their way into your property to recover goods. It'll be best to advise your house mate to actually respond and work with the DCA/Bailiffs.

**So we don't buy from Russia.**   


Thank you.

Russia sells onto European and global markets.  If anybody buys from those markets some gas may have originated in Russia but they're not buying from Russia and the wider markets insulate you from sources playing funny-buggers with the valves.

What I have said from the start is,
      
     ""What we do do is we buy from a European market via a Dutch pipeline,
      which in itself buys from Russia, but we have one degree of market separation.""

So there's no attempt to mislead people on my part, rather you want to play with Aussie Rules goalposts.   The gas the UK has been using has not been bought from Russia.  Russia sells to all markets it can sell to.  The misdirection here is in you realising that I was right in saying the UK didn't buy from Russia and then trying to make out Russia selling to a market as being the same thing.  It's not. 

We signed a deal in 2012 to start buying from Russia which is where you probably got confused,  even if you loathe to admit it.

Moreover, the UK *is* doing OK. Not great, but OK.

A huge amount of Australia's GDP is dependent on mining and mineral extraction. The fact that China didn't slow down during the recession meant Australia didn't either. Canada, likewise has a very different economic make-up to the UK, with far more income from mineral resources which didn't falter during 2008/09. In many ways the USA fell hardest and deepest and whilst parts of the US are doing okay, there are parts that are not. Talking about the US is about as economically useful as talking about Europe. Talking about the economies of Arkansas and NYC in one breath is as useful as lumping Germany's economy in with Romania's ""because it's all Europe"".

Hong Kong is heavy on financials, but closely tied to China, which has seen ludicrous growth over the past decade (although there are several bubbles in China right on the brink of going pop big style), so HK survived quite comfortably. I'm not sure why you think a tiny City-Nation like HK is a fair comparison to a country like the UK anyway, you might as well bemoan us for not having the GDP per Capita of Monaco.

The UK can't sprint away from Europe economically because we rely on them to buy our stuff. Yes, absolutely we can try and open up more trade exporting *to* China, rather than being so biased towards importing *from* them. For instance, 1/3 of JCB Group income is derived from their Indian division. Having their claws into the Indian market saw them through the recession when Europe was going backwards. Boosting their presence in BRIC countries was a priority for them before the recession, and became even more so afterwards.

Clearly, it would be in the UK's interests to diversify it's economy from it's dependence on banking and financial services to reinvigorate sectors such as manufacturing (the death of which has been prematurely reported despite being in quite good health, just a bit smaller than we'd like it), along with various service sectors (IT and engineering rather than finance), etc, etc.

Just because I think one extreme is ridiculous, doesn't mean I'm a fan of the opposite.

The difference is how we want to solve it and I think ruining our domestic economy, making citizens and businesses in this country disproportionately suffer, while having a negligible effect on what is a *global* issue (climate change) that it's intended to help solve, lacks perspective and is the wrong way to go about it.

false,GordonTheGopher,null,null,"The fact that the show writers keep making dumb mistakes about American politics can show you very much that they are not American! The UK and America are, it is often said, ""Divided by a common language"" :)

Here's my theory. ""Doctor Who"" is very much a product of post-colonialism. You have to remember that it was first created in 1963, when the British Empire was falling apart. British people were having to deal with not only no longer being the ""rulers of the world"" but also realizing that they were wrong to try and rule the world. That they were not far off from the Nazis, who they had just bankrupted their entire empire fighting.

So the themes of Doctor Who are very much a take on those issues. The Doctor is the classic British gentleman explorer (in the tradition of Doctor Livingstone). He seeks out interesting things to see, mainly just to see them. If he encounters wrong as he travels, he tries to fix it. But he's not looking for wrongs to fix. He's just trying to see all the marvels of the universe. And sometimes when he tries to fix things, they end up worse than before, or barely better (which reflects how British people see the Empire.) Even if he succeeds, it usually costs many lives.

A lot of the classic villains are riffs on Nazis, particularly the Daleks (twisted mutants of hate) and the Cybermen (who try to make everyone identical like them.) 

When the series was revived in 2005, we are a long way past Empire times, so the themes are different. We have a lot of pro-difference themes. The Doctor loves seeing interesting and different things, and does not judge on appearances, often complimenting hideous alien monsters as ""beautiful."" We have pro-gay themes (Jack Harkness, occasional companion and bisexual adventurer). We have themes of different and scary cultures being nice when you get to know them (the Oood). We have slightly hamfisted attempts at being less than 100% white (eg Martha Jones, Danny Pink). It's all about the post-colonial value of multiculturalism. The idea that we are all unique and wonderful in our own ways. And the Doctor wants to see and explore all the wonderful variations of the universe.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Small seismemic events pose no threat to anyone, calling them earthquakes makes you sound silly.
&gt; 

The article itself said the earthquake was enough to make this well unsafe (very possibly caused the failure, we don't know yet)
&gt; 
&gt; They can frack under your house without permission
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Over a mile underneath you with no potential for adverse consequences, our mineral rights regime could do with a change though (purely so land-owners can monetise that fracking.
&gt; 

'no potential for adverse consequences'  I think we disagree here
&gt; 
&gt; They can frack near water supplies
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Aquifiers exist at ~500 feet...fracking doesn't occur until at least 5000 feet. The multiple redundant layers of concrete and steel casing that make up the main well make the risk of contamination tiny.
&gt; 

The well obviously goes through the 500 feet level.  

&gt; 
&gt; company has lied
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So ban the entire industry?

that company for sure, the one with most of the rights I might add

&gt; government has commisioned an environmental impact study
&gt; 
&gt;

However, a few quick bits from me:

1. Stay as tax-efficient as possible. If you have 3-4k per month, that means you can fill both your S&amp;S ISA and your wifes every year, and have 6-18k left over. 

2. If you plan on living to over 58, then having *some* money in a pension is fine. Your ISAs/taxables then need to last you the gap between retirement and 58, then you've got access to a load more money.

3. The tax advantages if you're a higher rate taxpayer are *huge*. You can also use up some past allowance straight away. To not use that *at all* feels like throwing money away to me. For every £6k you put in, the total goes up to £10k (you're taxed on the way out, but at income tax and with 25% tax free).

If I were you?

1. Put as much as I could into this years S&amp;S ISAs.

2. Put as much as possible into pensions to get the max tax relief for the higher rate.

3. Use the considerable amount left over to put into a taxable investment account.

When a foreigner buys something from us that cash comes into our country and circulates around. Each time that money changes hands the government gets some tax.

So, when we sell a flat to a Chinese buyer we get back some of the money that we sent them buying stuff. That million pounds is then flowing around here instead of being in a bank outside of the UK.

The UK has an open economy because we want (need) foreigners to inject cash into our country. That could be car factories or it could be selling shares or buildings.

This thing existed in the USSR, and included things like ""Second year, third term, third week : 8 hours mastering the timing and control of an eight ball launch with a head bounce"".

EDIT: The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATVOD) for the ATVOD defines on-demand video services as anything that meets the following criteria:

* The principal purpose of the service is the provision of programmes, and
the form and content of such programmes are comparable to those normally included in television programme services.

* The programmes are offered by the service ""on-demand"". That is, they may be selected by a user, and viewed at a time chosen by the user.

* The programmes are received by the user through an electronic communications network (including terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, cable network or via Internet Protocol).

* There is a person who exercises editorial responsibility in selecting and organising the programmes, and that person makes the service available for use by the public generally, and that person is under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom as defined by the AVMSD

Here's my very first comment to which you replied:  

      ""The UK does not import gas from Russia.""


http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2o1evg/the_only_fracked_site_in_the_united_kingdom/cmitvck

We haven't been buying or importing from Russia.  Absolutely zero back pedaling there.

- Russia hasn't been selling to us.

- You thought they had.  You were misinformed.  You wanted to make it personal and now you're taking it personally.

- Russia sells onto markets and in turn the UK may buy from said markets.  That doesn't mean the UK buys from Russia.

- We signed a deal in 2012 that said the UK would start buying directly from Russia at the end of 2014.

It's your poor reading comprehension coupled with your propensity to shoot off prematurely, it's your dishonesty, that is trying to make out that if you buy something that's been put onto a market then it's the same as importing from the origin.  It's clearly not.  

The 'edit' was simply this to address the allegation that it was me that was attempting to mislead:

      ""So there's no attempt to mislead people on my 
       part, rather you want to play with Aussie Rules 
       goalposts. The gas the UK has been using has not 
       been bought from Russia. Russia sells to all markets 
       it can sell to. The misdirection here is in you realising 
       that I was right in saying the UK didn't buy from Russia 
       and then trying to make out Russia selling to a market 
       as being the same thing. It's not.""

So you're being dishonest about that too.

We've not been importing *from* Russia.  We've not been buying *from* Russia.  We signed a deal in 2012 saying we would *start*.  I realise that you'd no doubt love this to be seen as a crisis of convenience to push closer political union - but in this case certainly YOU'RE WRONG, and it's certainly not a crisis of convenience that need include the UK because we've not been buying from Russia. 

When you say ""dishonest, deceitful, shit"" you actually know that it's you that shot off early and got it wrong.  That you are the one who is dishonest and now being deceitful.  You're saying these things against me but we both know, and you know that I know,  and I know that you know that I know, that the one who is squirming and who realises they got it wrong, and who is being disingenuous - is you.

I said from the very start that we do not import from Russia but ""What we do do is we buy from a European market via a Dutch pipeline, which in itself buys from Russia, but we have one degree of market separation.""  And ZOOOOOOOOM you have to move your goalposts *AGAIN*, and try to make out that it's about buying from the same markets that Russia sells to.

The time he spends ""on camera"" is only a tiny amount of that. What does he do with the rest of his time? 

To me, that unknown time holds the key to understanding him. I think he spends a great deal of time scouting out time and space. Finding crisis points, pondering how to influence them. He gives the impression of stumbling upon many situations, but I believe a lot of that to be actually planned. He can watch and rewatch every event as often as he likes. He can plan something to the most minute detail, like Bill Murray did in Groundhog Day. 

This also explains why a mortal wife would be a huge problem. While he certainly develops feelings towards some of his companions, I think he spends only a tiny amount of his time in their presence. 

However, that's also the reason why he so desperately needs companions. After brooding over a situation for months or even years, he needs somebody to act as a reality and morality check.

As for his purpose, well, I have this theory. I belive it was Rose Tyler who remarked that ""Timelords look human"" and the Doctor told her that no, it was ""humans who look Timelord"".
