This is because it only assumes results, so when you are expected to win and you win, you will remain at the same spot (the predicted points), whereas losing when you are expected to win will lose you 3 points (thus 3 points less than the predicted point haul).

It's like expecting to have 12k $ after a year of saving, if you forget to deposit 1k in month 6, your predicted savings will go down 1k, but then in month 7 you deposit 2k and suddenly you are upto 12k $ goal again. So in the end the 'real table' and the alternative will converge and eventually if you deposit exactly for 12 months you will get exactly 12k and if you ignore for 12months you will have 12k - 12*1k.

true,turkeysandwiches,flair5,,"I've had to use the NBC replays on a several occasions when I couldn't watch live and stayed in the dark of the result.

The main thing is, you have to be familiar with how the site works before diving in headfirst:

1. Replays don't go up until about 2+ hours after the final whistle.

2. Bookmark the replays page (http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/#replays).  The scores will always be in the header so be sure to scroll down ASAP when you submit the URL.

3. Find the match under the ""replays"" heading and click ""watch now.""

4. When the next page opens, there is a header that states you can close the ""spoilers,"" or scores of other matches including the one you want to watch.

5. Enjoy the match hopefully without glitches (see below).

Unfortunately, my previous experiences with the replays on NBC haven't been so pleasant, and that's not just because two of the matches I had to replay were our 0-3 and 1-5 drubbings by West Ham and Liverpool respectively.  If your internet is not crystal clear (i.e. fuck Time Warner), a hitch in the stream and buffering could lead to the match jumping ahead inexplicably or jumping to a highlight from later in the match.  I haven't the faintest clue why my streams jumped ahead after a buffer, but you can be sure I spewed countless cunts and fuck-alls for my entire apartment building to hear.

But generally, the vast majority of Rangers supporters wanted to be demoted due to the SFA opting to punish the club to their own agenda. They wanted Rangers to start again, but by only placing them in the Championship (1 league below the SPFL) in a way that it won't harm the Scottish game as we won't be away from the top league for longer than a year thus it won't create a loss of revenue generated by Rangers not being there which is so evident - esp looking on at Celtic's avg attendances and their fans disillusion with the game. Anyways, in spite of this motion that we were being used to fill the pockets of those that didn't want us there or wanted to see the team suffer, we opted for the lowest division of Scottish football. It has been fun. I have seen various grounds throughout the country and it's good being away from that other mhob for a while.

It looks like from the still that the pilot wasn't far from having 'a bad time' as my instructor loved to put it.  When you do a cross wind landing, regardless or if you favour the crab or slip methodology, the idea is to keep the wing that is facing the direction of the wind, lower than the wing which is facing downwind. 

This is because planes like to land on their undercarriage, not be flicked over.   It is really quite easy with a gust of wind to have the windward wing lifted.

Anyway the picture shoes the wing is still quite far from striking ground.  I've no doubt it was within x wind limits.

**Any landing everyone walks away from is good landing**, any landing the plane can be used again after a great landing.  Given that a Dash 8 has a demonstrated xwind of 32knots, and according to the TAF (assuming today!) we've got a max xwind gust of 25knots, this is probably one of those looks worse than it really is photos.

There's a few markets listed on the right hand side of this subreddit, localbitcoins, bitbargain, speedybitcoin, bittylicious, quickbitcoin.

Each have their own particulars, of which I'm sure others with more experience with their services can answer better than me.

I am obviously rather biased when I point out [IBWT](https://ibwt.co.uk/) (yes I work there). We have a variety of deposit/withdrawal options, depending upon a customers preference. 

We are registered and compliant with ICO ([Information Commissioners Office](http://ico.org.uk/)) regulations if the security of your identity is of concern. And certain methods of IBWT deposits (dependent upon amount) require minimal to zero identification.

[FAQ](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/FAQ)

[Funding](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/funding)

It should be noted that at IBWT we do not currently have a large amount of traders (we're still relatively very young), as can be viewed directly from our [trade windows](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/btc_gbp) (no need to register/login), so if you are after larger amounts then you might need to purchase via another service.

I do suggest checking all the other services out though, and determining which is best for you.

This is important. If Stevie truly believes then it will radiate throughout the whole team. Just a shame Carra couldn't have lasted a bit longer for this. Whether we win the league or not this team, this combination, this spirit, this style of playing with Rodgers is incredibly exciting. Loving every moment.

What I want:


- Top 4 finish
- Suarez to stay
- Some nice summer signings


What I dream of:

- That above but winning the league. 

I have visions of Stevie lifting the trophy. Then pausing. Something isn't right. 


""What's up Stevie lad?""


Stevie: ""Eehm...there is someone missing here. Get up here soft lad."" 

Points to Carra. Carra scrambles over everyone. 

Camera zooms in. Deep breath. Stevie and Carra lift the trophy. The crowd goes fucking nuts. 

Suarez hasn't seen anything like it in his life. He is crying and laughing. Sturridge is dancing like he just popped 10 disco biscuits. Skrtel is fist pumping. Sterling is on Rodgers shoulders clapping. It is out of control.

But what is this? Toure is trying to get involved too. Uh oh. He knocks the trophy out of Stevie's hands. It smashes to the ground. Classic Toure. No fucks are given. The party continues for a week.

true,Popeychops,eng-Oxfordshire,Southern Softie,"&gt; It is a vicious cycle of inward investment fostering inward growth, even the article you posted points this out:

What kind of academic are you? It's stupid-talk to suggest that young people *shouldn't* go where the jobs are. Consider the urbanisation at the start of the Industrial Revolution: if young people had not been permitted to move from rural land into cities, factories would never have come into being. Progress to a better future is not about trying to maintain some status quo for sentiment's sake. Isn't that why we're having this referendum?

If London is the safest investment (and its growth seems to suggest so), I don't want the UK government wasting money on less beneficial ventures.

&gt;They can claim that all they like. Besides, it's a side issue don't you think? Or do you really think waving a Saltire at a tennis match makes him an unfit politician?

It does, it makes him appear ungracious and opportunistic. As I'm sure you know, most of the English seem to view him as a figure fit only for derision, and anything that gives them further ammunition makes him more of a laughingstock.

&gt;But Norway does have an equivalent population to Scotland, so it's a reasonable comparison looking forward.

&gt;That's what I'd like to know.

Isn't that a contradictory statement? They are equivalent to Norway (with half the oil wealth), but haven't had their Government set up an oil fund already? Why haven't the SNP set one up? I'm sure it would be very popular. Since they have not done so already, it becomes unreasonable to expect them to create one in the near future.

&gt;Mate, it already is.[1] And it's been up at 5x as much in 2008 and 2011.

Well, colour me surprised. The price of unleaded hasn't matched that increase in real terms (although I was 6 years old in 1999). Crude is such a volatile commodity that anything could happen. The production has already crashed once, and I imagine 1/3 peak in 2020 is an optimistic estimate. Production costs also increase as wells get more depleted, since significantly more energy is required for extraction. That means that the price of oil will have to rise faster than the price of extraction, otherwise the well ceases to be financially viable at some point.

Naughton is weak going forward from the left so we put our only winger on the left side to compensate. We then allowed Walker to push up so much that he was essentially somewhere between a RWB and a RM (remember he actually played RM for a short spell against Swansea IIRC) so that the right side had some potency as well.  Capoue was tasked to fill in for whoever charged forward (again, mostly Walker but sometimes Kaboul) so that there was always a solid three players to stop the break. Sometimes the three players were overwhelmed, but that's the risk you run and is exactly why we have moved from winning through clean sheets to just simply scoring more goals.

The three true CM's allowed us to dominate position and it seemed like whoever the ball fell to of the three would press forward then the other two would make secondary runs while Ade played more of deep-lying CF type role.

Next year we will be getting both Lukaku and Piazon back from very successful loan spells.

Assuming we go with a three striker squad again I would expect a big name experienced striker signing (from all accounts its going to be Cavani).

Recent performances of Torres aside (hes coming back from injury), if we aren't able to sell Torres in the summer due to his huge wages, I can see he would still be a good second choice to someone like Cavani. 

I don't think Ba will be with us next season and Eto'o will probably have moved on to the MLS (although he has been great for us this year).

Personally I'd love to see Cavani as a main striker, Lukaku as second choice with Piazon also back playing in blue.

However I think it more likely that we would go with a line-up like Cavani, Torres, Lukaku as it would be a better age spread and has relevant EPL experience with Piazon being loaned to an EPL club for more experience (hes still young).

As for reasons this is unlikely: Its looking like Liverpool with have a CL spot next year.

so is this ironic? definitely.  but I really wouldn't rule anything out in terms of tactics and formations yet, as it's too early to say.",0,1392261966,null,0,false,0,cfe1bxs,t3_1xqrmx,t1_cfe1bxs,t1_cfe10dp,null,1432374902,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"1. I have to say that I'm satisfied with him. I don't always like his tactical choices or in-game moves, but the results are overall good. It's true that the Cartilage Free Captain stats guy has made a pretty compelling case that--in terms of chances created and conceded--we're still not playing like a genuine top-4 side and our underlying numbers remain underwhelming. Still, we're winning. Personally, I think Sherwood has benefitted enormously from Adebayor's form. If you subtract Ade from this equation, then it's very hard to imagine us winning so many games. And, for the record, I think that relying on Adebayor long-term will ultimately frustrate and disappoint us. Never the less, I certainly give credit to Sherwood for making the most of one of our highest-paid players. If he could find ways to get the same success out of Soldado and (when healthy) Lamela, I'll be thrilled.

2. I think he deserves to be acknowledged in several areas. At times, he seems to have restored some level of confidence, drive, and intensity to the team--like today. I certainly appreciate that he has modified his approach to games to suit the situation. This has been successful at times, but he hasn't gotten it right every game. Of course, it's unfair to expect him to be perfect, but the results suggest that he deserves considerable credit here. I think it's also worth mentioning that he seems to have good relationships with many of the players, and that he shows confidence in them. Bentaleb is the obvious example, and today I think we really saw how good he can be. At the same time, it appears that Sherwood is willing to give players the opportunity to play their way into the squad. Capoue is the obvious example today as well. 

3. Sherwood has had some moments that left me puzzled, although I'm not sure I could boil it down to anything general. Not using subs against Hull was confusing, and some of his other substitutions have seemed misguided. I also think that his approach against City was silly. There are also times when the team seems confused and disorganized, as though he's told them to just have a run out. He also needs to do a better job of getting players ready for the kick-off, because too often we take fifteen or twenty minutes to find our game.

Think about what you're doing here. You've essentially fabricated some bizarre set of ""rules of shit talking"" that unsurprisingly favor you. So your fans are allowed to brag about European Cups from before they were fucking born but I can't mention that we've been the better team in recent years? 

Overall league performance with many of the same players means fuck all but accomplishments that were achieved with entire squads of now retired or even deceased players is relevant? 

Oh and don't forget this season counts too because you've been better. No tangible accomplishment to hold onto, but we can talk about this season because you say so?

What I hate most about LFC and Arsenal fans on reddit is that they have no idea how good they've had it compared to almost every other team. Finishing above LFC was a big deal for our fans because it's not something we'd historically done very often. 

The bottom line is you do not get to choose what supporters of another team are proud of. You can decide whether or not it bothers you, but this ""YOU CAN'T BE SMUG ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE RULES"" crap is fucking retarded.

Everton plays mostly mid-table and lower teams until the end where they have a few tough matchups.  We alternate between top and bottom teams, with a slight trend in more difficult towards the end.

Obviously each game is unique and there's no guarantees, but it helps visualize the difficulty of schedule as the season finishes out.

They still haven't got the VTOL system to work properly and the USMC, the main mover behind the VTOL variant as a replacement for their Harriers has decided against buying that F-25 variant (I've seen stories that show heavily reduced order numbers and zero purchase depending on where you look). 

It is needlessly to say very over budget and recently there were stories that several of the companies were busy installing Chinese parts in to the things in order to try and cut costs, meet schedules and such. 

That isn't to say that the Chinese parts aren't any good just that America was intended every part to have MADE IN USA stamped on it and going to China for various bits does rather constitute a national security issue for them. 

There is also the question of how many actual machines will be brought, whilst it is a technological marvel it's sister aircraft the F-22 hasn't been produced in anywhere near the anticipated numbers, making it an exceptionally expensive aircraft.  

I'm also dubious about just how effective 'stealth' will be on the F-35 when one of its roles is close air support, which usually means lots of munitions hanging off the wings and such; even the US army seems to be looking at it's A-10 fleet and pondering keeping them in that role rather than going with the F-35.

OP, before you watch Children of Earth (Season 3), please consider this:

Personally, having seen him in the role he plays in Children of Earth, I'm having a hard time finding him good for the role of The Doctor. This is no reflection of his acting; he was absolutely brilliant. But I'll always see his character from CoE when I look at him. And I think it pretty much guarantees that TW won't be brought back. Sad.

Side note: He's also in Fires of Pompeii, in which he does a fantastic role. Once again, strange. The Doctor has come face-to-face with himself/not himself. 

I really hope they come up with a good explanation for this all!

We were chaotic last night, and they continually countered us with ease.  The fact that they didn't put any away was thanks to the combined brilliance of Lloris' and Kaboul, as well as poor, low-confidence play from Newcastle.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"The places you've mentioned are all very different and you would be wise to have a brief skim over the wikipedia articles for each city and possibly each university.

I'll also say that I can't recommend one uni over another without knowing exactly which ones you mean, and I can't recommend an area without knowing what you're looking for, so I hope the descriptions below give you some ideas.

What I'll do for now is to give you a brief summary of each city/area:

Norwich is the capital of Norfolk, one of the UK's larger counties. Norwich was once a large industrial city, which produced a variety of things, from shoes to chocolate by way of joinery and clothing. It was also a large producer of aircraft.

As a result of the aircraft production, coupled with the fact that it existed, Norwich was bombed heavily during WW2. As a result, much of the city is relatively newly built. Some people consider the immediate post-war architecture style to be quite ugly, although others don't.

Today, Norwich mainly produces insurance services (Aviva insurance) and Mustard (the famous Coleman's brand is from Norwich).

Norwich is regarded (in jest) by much of the country as a backwards city in a backwards county populated by inbreds for some reason. As I said, this attribution is supposed to be humorous.

Colchester is likely the oldest town in the UK, as it was founded by the Romans and was for a time the capital of the Roman province of Britannia. It has a strong history and is mainly known as a military town as there have been units garrisoned there probably since the time of the Romans and there has certainly been a barracks there for hundreds of years up until now. Colchester is also the location of the only ""military corrective training centre"" or military prison in the UK.

Colchester has a large museum devoted to the Roman era, as well as lots of ruins from the Medieval period as well. As a result, the town relies heavily on tourism. Business wise, the major local ""well-known"" brand is Paxman Diesels, who make, well, Diesel engines, for buses and trains etc. Colchester is also currently undergoing lots of redevelopment work.

Canterbury is another fairly small tourist town, which also has four universities. It hosts the famous Canterbury Cathedral, as well as Roman and Medieval ruins. Also, the Archbishop of Canterbury is essentially the day-to-day head of the Church of England, second only to the Queen (who is the actual head). The city also holds the Marlowe Theatre, named after Christopher Marlowe, a well-known English playwright who had a heavy influence on Shakespeare.

Birmingham is the second-largest city in the UK behind London. It hosts six universities and is a now a major international commercial centre. Birmingham used to be a major industrial centre, and still is in many ways.

Birmingham was heavily bombed during the war and much of it was redeveloped in the 50s and 60s, leading to some of the largest council estates (US= projects housing) in the UK, many of which are in the form of massive, and some would say ugly, tower blocks.

Birmingham is home to the famous Bull Ring centre, which is a large ""mall"" which developed out of the middle-age markets held in the city. Birmingham is also the nearest city to where Frank Whittle invented the jet engine for the allies in WW2, and where Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls worked out the theory behind how a nuclear weapon could be constructed in 1940, and where the cavity magnetron, discovered by John Randall and Henry Boot, was discovered, which is a crucial component of Radar and Microwave ovens.

Finally, Leicester. It is the 10th largest city in the UK and was a major industrial centre during and after the Industrial Revolution, mainly being concerned with the production of shoes and hosiery. It now exports mainly services, and is a major retail centre. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the UK, and is particularly home to people from south-east Asia, partly due to a poorly thought out ad campaign. This occurred when Idi Amin ordered people of Asian descent to leave Uganda. Leicester city council, for some reason, decided to run an ad campaign telling the refugees not to come to Leicester for fear of overloading the welfare system. Unfortunately for the council, this backfired as it let the refugees know that Leicester was an option for them.

With a 2:1, unlikely. Too many graduates, not enough jobs, they can more than afford to limit themselves to firsts only and as many UCAS points as they like.

One option might be to stay in education, but that's honestly probably just going to leave you with more debt, even less experience compared to other people your age, and still no job, much less a career. 

Did you do a part time job while you were studying? If not, you're probably finding you're being rejected through lack of practical experience. This is obviously difficult to get without having a job. Volunteering can help, but even that's starting to get competitive. There tends to be a recruitment agency style organisation for volunteers in most cities, so find out what the one near you is, and get in touch.

Movies that can play with your emotions like that are masterpieces for me.

 Then, there is the prison part of the movie, which is also quite entertaining, and finally the third act is again in courtroom. For me, the movie was absolutely astonishing. Just watched it 2 days ago, and it was simply brilliant.

 I kind of think it is slightly underrated, and I am quite surprised that this movie isn't at least as half as talked about and popular as likes of Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption.

 To top it all, movie is completely based on true story, with just few of the parts slightly changed to fit cinema more, like him living in a cell with his father. Except that, most of the things weren't even exaggerated, unlike at most of the other movies, especially Hollywood ones.

While other students were off around the world on their jollies, partying and getting pissed, I spent my summer working and getting money. I'm planning to do that again when I graduate. Just for a few months to get some quick money, then bugger off somewhere else. There are loads of companies that can organise internships in the US, Australia...anywhere really. Have you thought of that? Yeah it will cost you a bit of money but it's a good bit of experience to have. Better than wasting your time here on JSA looking for a job anyway. I study a language so spending a year abroad was a compulsory part of my course, and I can tell you now, if you haven't done it yet, it's the best thing you will ever do.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Hope people read this because I think there's some tactical discussions to be had here.

I think for a while (at the start of the season) our team was aligned in such a way that the offensive prowess (and lack thereof at times) of Enrique and Johnson were really shown. They're maraudering fullbacks, which exposes us at the back and shows the defensive frailties in the midfield.

With Cissokho and Flanagan, while both get forward when we're dominating possession, they're both more traditional fullbacks. You could hardly confuse them for wingbacks as Enrique and Johnson are. With Ciss and Flanno we are (despite Kolo and Skrtel's mistakes) a more balanced team. It allows Stevie to actually play that DM position and for Suarez, Sturridge, and Sterling to all occupy wide spaces without being pushed too far in field to accommodate the wingback. 

Basically, I think Cissokho has become ""steady"". But at LB I'm not sure that even earns you a spot on a bench for most clubs unless the starting LB has injury troubles. Do we sign him this year? With Robinson coming through (even he's never a starter for us), I think we have to be aiming for someone who eclipses Enrique at this point.

Right now Enrique is the standard for us. His physicality is definitely something we've missed, along with his pace. The question is whether Rodgers can make him tactically smarter. 


But if we're looking at the balance of the team, I think this season and the next 2 will require more defensive minded fullbacks in order to allow for what is a remarkably offensive midfield and attack. 

Gerrard has adapted so I'm not sure we really need to go buy a top DM. We might be best served picking up CL level fullbacks and perhaps letting Flanno get a shot at owning that position.

true,TheKingMonkey,null,null,"It's down to the discretion of the guard/ticket inspector really. I've worked in the industry for fifteen years and even though I haven't dealt with tickets or passengers in more than ten I'm well aware of how many sob stories guards hear every day. The problem is so many chancers try their luck to get a cheap or free ride they use up all the sympathy of the guard for the genuine cases. Using a railcard discounted ticket without a valid railcard is probably the second most common stunt after trying to use off peak tickets on a peak train. 

So my advice is this; find the guard before you board the train and ask. Being charming will certainly help your cause, I'd even recommend offering to pay the excess fare if he/she isn't cool with you not having a railcard. Implying you have lost or mislaid the railcard in the past couple of hours probably won't do you any harm.
Boarding and waiting for them to find you generally has less success, in my experience at least.

Alternatively you could just find or replace the railcard. ",0,1392286262,null,0,false,0,cfe8fg2,t3_1xsaky,t1_cfe8fg2,t3_1xsaky,null,1432378312,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

They aren't as involved in the attack although they do press forward regularly they don't commit the way Johnson and Enrique do.

My only complait about Aly is he seems shackled, as if BR has instructed him to play a certain way and not deviate. He barely charges the flanks and pretty much offers himself as a pass option only to move it backwards or 1-2 it. His crossing is not great either, or precise. There's no way 'this' guy attracted the attention of Milan all those years ago.

On the other hand he's strong, durable and composed, willing to run for the team and not bad in the tackle. According to WhoScored he makes more tackles and clearances than Enrique. Then again he brings fewer Key Passes, Crosses and Long Balls. Basically he's a defense-first LB.

All things considered I'd actually say buying him might be a good idea. He's no world beater but Enrique is only 28 and an important member of the squad, so it's not like he'll be leaving anytime soon. Aly offers decent back-up and a contrasting style, which is useful for tactical reasons, and will possibly be available cheap.

true,eddy_butler,null,null,"I haven't seen any comments defending Hughton on this thread, so I'll throw a few points to consider into the mix which will hopefully, at the least, give you some food for thought. 

When we were promoted from the Championship, our 5 year objective (as outlined by David McNally) was to establish ourselves as a financially secure Premiership side. The first 3 of those years were to focus on relegation avoidance. We are now in our third year in the Premiership and our goal should still be to avoid relegation. With that in mind, consider the following:

* At present, we are avoiding relegation. Not only that, but we are 3 points off 10th placed Swansea.

* Our recent performances (but not results) have been satisfactory. Results matter, and I understand that, but when we fail to convert chances and concede two late goals to a team with a bigger budget then you have to look beyond blaming the manager. 

* We have only conceded 8 goals in 7 EPL games in 2014 (incl. clean sheets against Newcastle and Manchester City).

* RVW is yet to shine. He may not reach the levels we all got starry eyed about, but there is still a distinct possibility that he might start firing with Hooper.

* Hughton has provided a lot of midfield options at the moment, which gives us the flexibility to adapt to different styles of football (e.g. playing a defensively minded Fer, Johnson and Tettey against Man City worked wonders)

* Our wage spend vs points ratio was one of the best last season and this season. ""The model suggests Stoke, Cardiff, Chelsea, Norwich, Crystal Palace and Man City are about where we would expect them to be"" - [Source](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.financialfairplay.co.uk/latest-news/wage-spend-versus-points-achieved)

* With the rise in TV rights, the funding available for ALL of the Premiership teams (incl. those newly promoted sides) has made it incredibly competitive and difficult to balance risk vs reward in the transfer market. Everybody seems to have a myopic attitude towards transfer spending. The majority of teams we compete against can utilise greater budgets and 13 teams have higher average attendances this season.

* Sacking a manager directly following a transfer deadline and whilst 4 points separates 8 teams (including us) is likely to have adverse affects that may be irrecoverable in the time left this season. West Ham's season has nearly been turned on its head by 3 fortunate consecutive victories. The margins in the EPL are incredibly tight, yet people seem to think that position is the only factor at this stage in the season. If we were 20th and one point behind first, would you still be calling for Hughton out?

I could write an equally lengthy rebuttal to my own argument, but in the balance of things, I genuinely believe that the opportunity cost of sacking Hughton now is too high. Thankfully, I have faith that McNally won't bow to the pressures of myopic and impatient supporters and will stick to the long term plan that he set out with Hughton when we initially hired him. After all, he is still fulfilling the criteria and there is plenty of football still to be played. Just try and see beyond pointing the finger at one person in a huge organisation that operates in an incredibly competitive industry based on a couple of bad results (but not sub-standard performances).

For the period between the start of the data collection on 11 September 2001 
to 31 March 2008: 
 
• There were 1,471 terrorism arrests. This excludes 38 arrests made between 
the introduction of the Terrorism Act 2000 on 19 February 2001 and 11 
September 2001 and 119 stops at Scottish ports under Schedule 7 of the 
Terrorism Act 2000. 
 
 
• In 2007/8 there were 231 terrorism arrests compared with an annual average 
of 227 since 1 April 2002. 
 
• Thirty-five per cent of terrorism arrests (521) resulted in a charge, of which 
340 (65%) were considered terrorism related. The proportion of those 
arrested (35%) who were charged is similar to that for other criminal offences 
with 31% of those aged 18 and over arrested for indictable offences 
prosecuted. For a further 9% of terrorism arrests some alternative action was 
taken (e.g. transferred to the immigration authorities). 
 
• The main offences for which suspects were charged under terrorism 
legislation were possession of an article for terrorist purposes, membership of 
a proscribed organisation, and fundraising, all offences under the Terrorism 
Act 2000. 

this is the table breaking down what they were charged with...

possession of an article for terrorist purposes (32% of such charges); 
• fundraising (15%); 
• membership of a proscribed organisation (14%); 
• provision of information relating to a terrorist investigation (9%); 
• collection of information useful for a terrorist act (7%); 
• other offences under terrorist legislation (23%). 


Of those that were charged, less than half were actually convicted of the offence.

Floods threatening one of the most built up areas in the country is going to generate a higher necessity for action than floods threatening areas that are mostly rural because there are far more things that need to be sorted out and greater scale to consider.

And I don't think that anyone can argue that London *isn't* more built up, with higher population density, than the north: if you lost a square mile of central London to flood waters, you'd have far more people to get away from it all than if the same square mile was chopped out of, for instance, Newcastle or Leeds. ^(Nearly put Leicester here, out of familiarity with the area, and then decided to go for the proper north, not the midlands)",0,1392290151,null,0,false,0,cfe90e5,t3_1xpa05,t1_cfe90e5,t1_cfdscg7,null,1432378585,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think it's ""companion who resonated the strongest with the previous Doctor"", not ""whoever happened to be standing by at the time of death"". For instance, 11 travels with Clara now, but he imagined seeing Amy, his longest traveling companion in that form, before he went. Also, not sure why Peter Davison would sound American. I think you mean Colin Baker would have, but that doesn't hold water either because 5 had just started traveling with Peri, she wouldn't have been imprinted quite yet. Not to mention Ace would have been 7's favourite companion, and she definitely wasn't American. As for Eccleston, well there are people here that argue that Clara meeting the War Doctor had something to do with Nine's voice. Of course, Nine wouldn't be able to remember her, so he got the specific dialect a little off, but it turned out okay.

Personally, I like this theory. It gives a feeling of character growth and definitely makes the Doctor out to be a little more sentimental than he usually lets on. Which is okay. Obviously these things aren't always planned (or possibly ever planned), but I believe the creators have at least thought about it in passing over the recent years (9-10 and 11-12 seem very intentional) and people can accept what they like.

One who makes subtle points.

&gt;It's stupid-talk to suggest that young people shouldn't go where the jobs are. 

Agreed, but a careful reading of what I said will show I didn't actually suggest that.

My point was that talent is being sucked into London along with investment leaving other areas unable to compete.

&gt;If London is the safest investment (and its growth seems to suggest so), I don't want the UK government wasting money on less beneficial ventures.

The problem is that you're assuming a linear relationship:

Growth -&gt; Investment -&gt; Government spends money there -&gt; profit!

What I'm saying, uncontroversially, is that there is a reciprocal relationship between growth, investment and government spending. Government can create local growth and spark investment by simply investing in an area. Consider what happens when a new military base is built.

The more Government invests in London the more attractive it becomes to investors. And that is what creates growth, which starts the cycle of investment and government spending again. 

If more was spent on for example national infrastructure, and our infrastructure is woefully behind in the UK, other cities would become more attractive investments. But money also needs to be spent rejuvenating city centres adding local infrastructure and attracting investment. An example of where that's worked fairly well is Leeds, which has a lovely city centre and for a northern city is doing fairly well. (Although like most places it's been hammered in recent years)

&gt;It does, it makes him appear ungracious and opportunistic. As I'm sure you know, most of the English seem to view him as a figure fit only for derision, and anything that gives them further ammunition makes him more of a laughingstock.

As opposed to David Cameron standing in London proclaiming how much he loves Scotland? If you actually paid attention to Salmond he's potentially the most shrewed politician around at the moment. He actually debates with opponents rather than playing the question dodging game. But you won't see much of that in London, you'll need to pay attention to Scottish news.

&gt;Isn't that a contradictory statement? They are equivalent to Norway (with half the oil wealth), but haven't had their Government set up an oil fund already? Why haven't the SNP set one up? I'm sure it would be very popular. Since they have not done so already, it becomes unreasonable to expect them to create one in the near future.

No. You see this is one of the reasons why Scotland needs independence. The Scottish Government doesn't have the authority to establish an oil fund. It's one of the core issues of the SNP's manifesto for Scotland that they would establish such a fund. Not doing so would be madness and  political suicide.

&gt;Well, colour me surprised. The price of unleaded hasn't matched that increase in real terms (although I was 6 years old in 1999).

[No, it has almost doubled though](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2Fsn02638.pdf&amp;ei=g6v8Us30BoGshQfA9oGgDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw5wPNTz48uDQPopMAmEvKeT4Jqg&amp;sig2=1Tu7MiaPAI5yirHIMAatBg&amp;bvm=bv.61190604,d.ZG4)

&gt;The production has already crashed once, and I imagine 1/3 peak in 2020 is an optimistic estimate. Production costs also increase as wells get more depleted, since significantly more energy is required for extraction. That means that the price of oil will have to rise faster than the price of extraction, otherwise the well ceases to be financially viable at some point.

Except that countries like India and China are now industrialising and demand for oil continues to rise. Investment continues in the NS despite the fact the oil is getting harder to extract because the oil is worth more now than it was in the last century. At some point of course you're right, the cost of extraction will probably outstrip the worth of the product and at that point the NS will be dry. But this isn't a 2020 proposition, this is 2040/2050 we're talking about (It might be possible to find some public figures on that, again but I'm relying on contacts in industry. So take my word or leave it. It would be odd for oil companies to be investing heavily in Aberdeen with only 6 years left on the clock though, wouldn't it?)

&gt;I don't expect anything other than a decrease in NS oil revenue.

&gt;Drug related harms and the costs to society remain high in Britain, with a growing consensus that the current enforcement led approach is not working. In recent months the independent UK Drugs Policy Commission has highlighted the fact that Government is spending around £3 billion a year on a policy that is often self-defeating; and the Home Affairs Select Committee has concluded Government action is needed ""now, more than ever"" to consider all the alternatives to our failing drug laws and learn from countries that have adopted a more evidence based approach. We are concerned that, in this age of austerity, nobody is checking whether Britain's current approach is value for money - or money wasted. **We therefore call on the Government to commission an authoritative and independent cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 within the next 12 months, in order to provide the evidence for Parliament to pursue a more effective drugs policy in the future.**

true,fireflyfire,null,null,"I had a similar situation when graduating in 2011 (yay, recession!), in that I was on track for a 2.1 in Politics from a good university, but didn't have enough UCAS points for the vast majority of graduate schemes.

There is far too much competition for graduate schemes, so you need to look elsewhere. Finance is particularly competitive and unless you're in a group which corporate employers are particularly trying to recruit (women, ethnic minorities) it's unlikely they'll want to hire you if you don't have the minimum 'qualifications' (i.e. UCAS points).

My advice is to look for jobs which are entry level/open to graduates but do not call themselves graduate schemes. Plenty of employers are looking for capable, educated people.

Try looking at your local public sector employers such as councils, police, fire, NHS, and on the Civil Service public jobs site. It might not be your dream job but often promotion or moving around to different departments is possible in these organisations. Medium to large charities provide a huge range of services to a lot of people and operate just like businesses. They all have HR, Finance, IT departments etc just like a for-profit business would, and have graduate level jobs. Almost every city or county will have a Council for Voluntary Service (CVS) which is a membership organisation for local charities. Have a look at their directories or ask if they can include you on a mailing list to send you any jobs going (often charities send around jobs via newsletters/group emails as a cheap way of advertising vacancies).

The other route is work experience and networking. I am a huge believer in networking and no, this doesn't mean your parents need to have friends from Eton. 

Identify some sectors or jobs you'd like to work in, then ask around. Does your best friend's mum work in the finance department for a local firm? Could you ask if she can put you in touch with her boss about some work experience? Does that old family friend run a business you could spend a few weeks at? 

A couple of weeks might become a couple of months, then it might turn in to a job. If not, at least you'll have relevant experience to stick on your CV and a good reference. You might also find out that actually finance sucks but it looks like marketing is a fun department to work for. This narrows down your career options.

It sounds like you don't need to sign on for JSA if you're questioning it? It probably won't help with doing 'ad hoc' work experience as you have to make it to their appointments or they might send you on their own work placements which may not be relevant to you, e.g. shelf stacking.

I hope that's given you some ideas, good luck in your job search.

Herein lies the rub.

Westminster can say it wants in an attempt to maintain the union. Losing Scotland is an absolute no-go, so they will say anything to keep them. The only reason they will get called out on this is if Scotland votes Yes, they are bargaining on that not happening. 

A lot of the opinion on currency union comes from the Governor of the BoE's speech in Edinburgh. Depending on who you ask you will get wildly different interpretations of what the conclusion of this speech was. The fact is though that Carney was very neutral on the issue, he explained the benefits and the downsides.

Many in the 'Yes' camp (and some notable people in the 'No' camp too), and I have to admit I feel this way too, do believe that a currency union would be a lot easier for both parties than a complete divorce, at least in the short term. As someone who believes this, Westminsters rhetoric is very frustrating - I honestly find it hard to believe they would 'cut their nose off to spite their face' in the event of a Yes vote, it seems self-destructive and obstructionist.

&gt;proven to reduce plastic consumption and waste

Citation required. Yes, making people pay for something that was once free will reduce the amount in the environment. But plastic bags have never been a huge part of environmental waste: [0.03% of marine waste](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/20/plastic-bags-symbol-waste-recycling), and [less than 1% of total domestic, commercial, and industrial waste, excluding construction and mining](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/apr/15/plastic-bags-waste).

So whilst Wales can boast it has reduced plastic bag waste by 75%, whilst boosting the [sale of plastic bags by 120%](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/24/bags-for-life-5p-charge-wales), none of that goes very for to helping the environment. Christ, Ireland saw an increase of 400% in purpose bought plastic bags (bin liners). Imagine how gouged the public would feel if they knew how little an effect they were making - not reusing free plastic bags for holding rubbish, but lining the pockets of another plastics supplier to only use their bags the once.

But we all get to feel good about it, so long as we are innumerate (as the politicians hope we are).

The committee consists of 8  members from across the parties, shown at the bottom. Groups of MPs can apply to the committee to have their topic debated, however in 2011 the website http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk was set-up to allow MPs to get public support for their petitions. When a petition on the site reaches 100,000 votes, which the one in the OP did earlier today, the committee is notified and the MPs in question can bring this forward as their evidence that the topic is widely seen as worth debating. The reason it isn't an instant debate allowance is because the committee is given time by the government to bring forward these backbenchers to the floor but they sometimes aren't given enough time to allow all the petitions to be debated so they need to decide on which of them is the most important/topical/in need of debate. The amount of time they are allowed to debate in changes hugely from no time at all in the month to several hours every week. 

The committee doesn't do the debating, they bring forward the backbenchers for the members of the House of Commons to debate.

The 8 members are:

* David Amess - Conservative - Southend West

They don't *know*, because they *haven't done it yet.* Showing that their plans are just that. *Plans*. Possibilities. Yet to be carried out.

""Difficult"" is not the same as ""impossible"", especially if Scotland does not ask for all of them.

&gt;the Government and all main parties in the UK have stated that they wont allow currency union 

The politicians have- just as they said they wouldn't raise university fees. They're only saying this to affect the outcome of the vote, it is not written in stone, because, economists agree [it would be mutually beneficial](http://www.businessforscotland.co.uk/5-indicators-of-growing-certainty-on-currency-union-with-scottish-independence/). 

You're dismissing Yes valid arguments as no more that ""promises made by politicians"", whilst at the same time holding up *actual* promises by some very untrustworthy Westminster politicians as cast-iron truths.

&gt;From the article - ""But she did leave open the possibility of an independent Scotland being allowed to charge students from the rest of the UK – if the country could justify the decision to the EU."" good luck with that when you will have caused more work for every country in the EU with the required new treaty negotiations.

Again, I stress *could*. Personally, I don't think Scotland should even try to, really.

That being said, [the issue was resolved](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/26/alex-salmond-snp-stance-nato-nuclear-weapons). In short, an Independent Scotland would not allow Trident to be *stationed* in it's waters, but it would allow vessels carrying nuclear weapons into Scottish waters, so long as it was necessary, and that NATO respect Scotland's wishes and try to do it as little as possible, as is done with Norway and Denmark.

I'm willing to bet that an organisation the size and age of the NHS still have a few out there, although I'll grant you that the majority *should* run.

However even if it does technically run, does the supplier support it on Windows 7 or do they only support it on certified platforms?

Will they charge more money to upgrade to a version that is supported on Windows 7 and will this require newer, more powerful hardware as a result?

&gt; So when the NHS spent billions on developing their internal system , surely they didn't base it off XP

I can tell that you have never worked for a large corporate.

They absolutely would spend millions developing on XP, especially if they have negotiated out their IT support into a long-term, multi-year maintenance contract with one of the large contractors like Capita or Cap Gemini.

Taking their share of the dept is still severance. It is final. An ongoing agreement to share a currency with a foreign government, who incidentally won't commit to using it long term and the uncertainty that brings, is not severance.

Why should the remaining UK be forced to risk their pound against the economic choices of a entity that is not under their control?

Fair do's, the same goes for you, but can I ask one quick question, when have you seen Capoue put in a good performance in terms of quality in possession/getting on the ball? because I've not seen that since his debut vs Palace and it's worrying because we need someone who can control the ball well and pass it about.

Eriksen's played his best out there for us, I think it limits our width a little, but we play such a fluid formation it's not as important as otherwise. In reality we should buy a left-winger or give it to someone who wants to play there (chadli/townsend/whoever) but playing players in positions they don't want to play isn't exactly a perfect scenario.

I think they could have, quite easily, gone to Westminster with open arms and say ""lets batter this out, once and for all"" before they published their white paper.

yeah agree on that. The reason is 2-fold. One, as you said, he can't charge forward and beat his man and Two, he wont have protection if he loses the ball. 
The first one of course prevents us from creating better chances in the final third, but the 2nd one is more lethal. 

Whenever Ciss is up and wide, stur/suarez will not compensate for his loss of possession. Instead, they will be waiting on CB shoulders. So now Ciss has 2 options - a cross behind the defensive line or a pass back(horizontally or slight behind) to a CM. He has been choosing the latter to retain the ball, because i dont think he is a very good crosser(he has been better lately).

Two, I know we all like to hate on Levy, but for just a minute let's consider his recent moves that put Spurs on equal footing with the PL elite.

- We are currently in year 2 of a 5 year partnership with Under Armour that will take us through the 2016-2017 season.  Estimated value at £80 million.

- This newly inked deal with AIA has us securing £16 million a year for 5 years, running through 2018-2019.

- We have a three year deal (for better or worse) with StubHub that will run through the 2015-16 season.  Estimated worth is around £5-7 million.

- New stadium construction is slated to begin later this year and might be available for the 2017-2018 season.  Naming rights will probably be up for sale.  Consider that Arsenal's deal with the Emirates is estimated to be around £150 million for both shirt and stadium rights for 5 years.  

These long term deals are what make Chelsea, Arsenal, and Man City so consistently powerful.  When you can secure next season's balance sheet in May, then you can go shopping with some confidence rather than selling the next Bale to build a team.

Thank you though for assuming I've not considered this, I'm not that stupid though, nor are most other Scots, despite what the Tories seem to think, I know that might come as a shock to you.

So here are the alternatives;
1. Scotland continues to use the pound without a currency union 
2. Scotland builds up a stockpile of British currency in the transitional period, and sets up it's own Scottish pound, pegged to Sterling, until the currency has enough stability to operate on its own.
3. We join the Euro

1 isn't ideal but a workable solution until the rUK realizes having a net exporter using it's currency to trade is going to have a negative impact on rUk and gets off its high horse and opens currency negotiations.  This however would lead to both sides being exposed to economic shocks in the other.

2 Begins the same as 1, but once we're de-pegged things may get smoother for both sides, the only problem is it is impossible to say how long it would take before a Scottish currency becomes viable on its own, but this isn't really a great solution for the rUk as a lot of people seem to think it is, as it could leave Scotland almost debt free, but even if we are denied our share of Sterling and do take our share of the debt for some reason, once de-pegged the Scottish government could in theory, I'm not saying that it would, but in theory it could inflate the debt away in a worst case scenario, but would end up being disastrous for both countries.    

3 isn't popular in Scotland, and there isn't much need to join the Euro, anyone saying we wont be let back into the EU without taking the currency should make a trip to Sweeden.

true,thegreenmonstuh,CO,colombia,"Idk why people like you keep pushing this subject, but here I'll try and explain:

Teams like Chelsea, Arsenal, RM, Barca, Man Utd, etc. are practically global brands and are recognized world wide. Add social media, online streams, and games like FIFA and PES and the exposure of these teams is tremendous. Access to them is basically unlimited. These are the teams that buy all the star players from all over the world, and those players themselves bring in new fans. Think about all the Santos fans that were die-hard Neymar fans. Once he was sold to Barcelona, I assure you some of those die-hard fans instantly started following Barcelona. Salah is the perfect example, as soon as Chelsea signed him, thousands of Egyptians started following Chelsea through Facebook and Twitter (or so I've noticed). There is nothing wrong with foreigners liking a team from another country, as long as they're real fans and follow the team through thick and think and don't switch allegiances when the team is doing poorly. 

If you've ever been outside of England, to another country where football is the popular sport, I'm sure you might have noticed people wearing jerseys and other gears of some of these teams. What's so bad about that? If anything you should encourage it, it brings the team more exposure, fans, and of course, money. Who's complaining about Chelsea making money (besides Arsenal fans)? I'm definitely not. ",0,1392302844,null,0,false,0,cfebw6w,t3_1xstoh,t1_cfebw6w,t1_cfebhf3,null,1432379945,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8
true,Clbull,null,null,"&gt; Is there an agency near you? If you really want a job...any job, just go to your local job agency and you'll probably be offered something on the spot - this is why I've never understood why people waste time going to the job centre. 

I've looked at a few agencies and sent my CVs to them. None have managed to get back to me, and often dealing with online agencies (i.e. Heat, Reed, etc) who advertise their jobs on job sites is a huge pain.

I think my mistake was not proactively calling and asking about job opportunities. I'm actually thinking of trying the JobCentre this time around.

&gt; Last summer I did toilet cleaning and worked in a warehouse through that. Yeah it was crap, 12hr shifts starting at 5 in the morning, minimum wage, working in a warehouse full of eastern europeans but it sure looks good on my CV.

The only two jobs I've actually declined were the AppCo door-to-door sales job and a call centre job that deals with charity firms. The latter I declined after hearing a load of horror stories from friends and acquaintances. Toilet cleaning may seem bad but at least it's not a heavily targets based job and doesn't require you to sell things nobody wants by invasively calling phone numbers all the time.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"Migs is still a very young keeper. As such mistakes come with the package. It's true that he's a very good shot stopper, his reflexes are surely comparable to the top keepers. However reflexes isn't what makes a great goalie anymore and that is the biggest reason why some of the best goalies hit their prime after their thirtieth birthday (just look at any number of goalkeepers who are considered elite and see how old they were during their most successful periods).

There are almost no goalkeepers who enter the squad of a top team at a young age and stay there for fifteen or more years. The only example of that in recent history is Iker Casillas. Courtois is another example of a young and successful keeper, as is De Gea, Neuer could fall into this category, perhaps Lloris who started his career at Lyon and entered the post at a young age. That is it though. Every other goalie has spent years improving and growing in quality.

Take the example of Edwin van der Sar. He also started very brightly and was a key member of a young quality Ajax side in the 90s. Won the CL, was voted the best goalkeeper in 1995! All this at the age by the time he was 25. He then made a high profile move to Juventus where things didn't really work out, he was even blamed for Juve losing the title on one occasion. After only two years he moves on to Fulham of all places! Rediscovers himself and hits high form to move on to Man Utd where he was undisputed #1 for 6 years. From age 35/36 to age 40/41. 

Now I'm not saying Mignolet can high the same heights, but I am advocating patience. This is his first season at a top club. He did well and in some matches he saved us points, that was clear. What will happen in the future is unpredictable though and hopefully we can enjoy him having a great career at our club for years to come.",0,1392302863,null,0,false,0,cfebwfx,t3_1xsxsg,t1_cfebwfx,t3_1xsxsg,null,1432379948,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I'll give you some pointers though, because you seem to need the help, don't try and take a complex argument and turn it into a simple metaphor, but yeah independence is 100% like buying an old shitty car of my own so I don't have to share an old shitty car with someone else.

I never mentioned Alex Salmond, or Nicola Sturgeon, these are the straw men I discussed earlier, if Independence happens I have no intention of voting for their party whatever that would be called, just as I have never voted for the SNP, my personal views and reasons for wanting Independence have nothing to do with the SNP or it's leadership although we share some similar opinions at time, so when you reply properly, if you are, don't mention them because what I want isn't necessarily the same as the SNP and assuming it is makes you look stupid.  The only time I mentioned the SNP in my first post was to say that they would say anything to get people to vote yes, hardly a resounding endorsement.


Finally your last two points, again don't address what I was saying in the slightest, but remember Scotland is a net gain to the British economy, if it was so shit, Westminster would be trying to punt us from the union that we are dragging down, but that isn't the case.

I hope that helps you learn how to have a proper discussion, but if you've failed to comprehend the underlying meaning of my post don't bother replying, there are people who actually want to talk about this issue properly, not just wank themselves off in public over how clever they think they are.

And nobody has to, agendas are subtle and indirect.

&gt;I don't think any of the 13 posts so far have focussed on a particular gender. 

Considering this post is about women and domestic abuse, it's very clear what the comments are directed at. It's the same bullshit with any thread about women; completely biased against women, giant threads comprised of men patting themselves on the back about how the claims are 'ridiculous' citing anecdotes and the like.

&gt;The results are being questioned because they don't go in to anywhere near enough detail. How was the question or questions asked? What yardstick was used to determine true domestic abuse - or was it determined by the people being asked (who - to a person - would be biased in their own best interests / experiences and perhaps not know the true legal definitions of domestic abuse).

Great, and the first few comments put forward and answered that question sufficiently, but it didn't stop there, now it's just a circlejerk.

&gt;Nobody is disputing that domestic violence is a bad thing. Nobody is arguing in favour of it or saying 'lol maybe she should've gotten back in the kitchen to make a sandwich' or whatever sexist crap one might imagine.

Again, sexism and general prejudice are rarely ever so direct. A more common indicator would be all the comments questioning the validity of the evidence without any opposition and with out any recognition for the actual victims of the crime.

&gt; What we are doing is questioning the validity of the study due to a lack of information. That's crucial. A scientist would say the same about any scientific study that lacks detail.

A scientist would conjure up counter evidence

&gt;We're within our rights to do that without implying that we're in favour of or condoning domestic abuse or implying anything to do with genders.

I never said anyone was condoning it, but the lack of empathy in the thread (and many threads like this one) shows your (royal you) prejudiced hand.

Innocent people don't deserve to be judged by the media, especially in emotionally charged crimes like sexual assault/paedophilia. Everyone gets in such a frenzy over these crimes that it feels like people are guilty the second they're accused, and if the court finds you not guilty, you just ""got away with it"". People get fired/divorced/disowned the second they're accused, their name becomes toxic, and their entire life falls apart, so they have nothing left when they finally get exonerated.

On the flip side is your argument. People too scared to come forward before for whatever reason may feel differently now the person is publicly accused of a crime, and people related to the incident may come to help the defence or prosecution.

Papers blanketing page after page with ""POPULAR PERSON IS LITERALLY HITLER"" then much later printing ""popular person found not guilty"" on page 47 doesn't help. I've read suggestions that if you dedicate pages to the accusation, you have to dedicate the same space to the reality afterwards, although while that seems fair in my head, something still niggles about press freedom.

Also some people in society love to be reactionary. Someone did something? Lets immediately jump to more laws, more anger, kill them all.

I think we'll could probably win one or both of Chelsea and Man City. But I refuse to get my hopes up after the Arsenal game. Considering them both a wash and hoping for the best is the only way I am going to stay sane and be able to watch these matches.

I am almost certain we'll lose to S'oton at St. Mary's.

Depending how secure we are in 4th, I can imagine dropping points to Crystal Palace and Newcastle in the end....

No you remember that comment that I made? In fact it's the one you replied to just now, y'know explaining why the thread is prejudiced as i'm about to explain again for all those who have a skull lined with lead.

&gt;The original articles headline reported on women but the actual figures cited - if you bothered to read the article at all - do mention men as well. Regardless of gender, we're still correct to question how the data was gathered. I would ask the same questions if the title was about men - not women.

Don't be so dishonest, it's an article about women **hence the fucking title** with statistics about men included but the main body is about women. Unlike a thread about men which looks something like this:

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1s5mq9/why_are_so_many_men_becoming_victims_of_domestic/ wow look at all that speculation and questioning of the evidence.

&gt;Apologies of my anecdotes about having personally suffered domestic abuse are not to your liking. As the victim of it, I suppose I only have myself to blame for bringing it up at all.

That's not what I was referring to at all, i'm deeply sorry for the trauma you have had to experience and any offence I may have caused.

&gt;Not they haven't. We don't know how the article gathered its data. We still don't know. The conversation evolved from there - but that's how conversations work. We're still right to question how the data was gathered - that's what intelligent people do when presented with statistics about society - be it gender, finance, politics or anything else. You'll see that all across Reddit.

It's not a conversation, the difference between this thread and one about politics, economics (although not exclusively, there are a fair share of circlejerks on /r/politics) etc is there is no discourse here, it's all affirmations, just look at it! The only remote deviation was [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1xsskd/domestic_violence_experienced_by_30_of_female/cfebekh) comment; even then it wasn't questioning the legitimacy of the circlejerk, just an aspect of some link someone provided.

&gt;Yes, because it's right to question how the evidence was gathered so we can better understand it

*without any opposition*. Your better understanding of one narrow minded view.

&gt;What victims? This is an impersonal study.

The 30% of women who suffer from DA. Much like in the link I showed above of men and DA, there was plenty of flowery sentiment there

I think that this is the right balance, but nobody pretends it is perfect, or even good. Best never necessarily implies good. But I don't think it can be another way.

I think we have the right balance with press freedom too. I think it is a problem with society that we might assume somebody to be guilty merely because they are accused. This is a primitive survival instinct which we have to learn to get rid of through the pursuit of education, *not* by trying to manipulate the press.

I'm not surprised at all, and don't believe I'm acting in such a manor, my point throughout everything I've posted this afternoon is that everything, including a currency union will be open for discussion, I am aware that outright refusal to consider something before talks begin is a negotiation tactic in itself, but a lot of the posters in this thread seem to think that since Osbourne has said it, it's all over for Scotland, my argument is that it is not.

    Around 1 in 12 (8.2%) adults had taken an illicit drug (excluding mephedrone) in the last year, a fall compared with 2011/12 (8.9%). This equates to around 2.7 million people;
    According to the 2012/13 CSEW, 2.6% of adults aged 16 to 59 had taken a Class A drug in the last year (equivalent to almost 850,000 people);
    Cannabis was the most commonly used drug, with 6.4% of adults aged 16 to 59 using it in the last year;
    The next most commonly used drugs in the last year were powder cocaine (1.9%) and ecstasy (1.3%). Along with cannabis, these were also the most used drugs in 2011/12;
    For all adults, the use of mephedrone in the last year has fallen from 1.1% in 2011/12 to 0.5% in 2012/13;
    Young adults (those aged 16 to 24) were more likely to have used drugs in the last year than older adults. However, the proportion of adults aged 16 to 24 taking any drug in the last year was 16.3%, down from 19.3% in 2011/12.

A huge part of jobs like that is simply knowing what to write. It's definitely harder than it used to be - when I got my first job in the NHS I think about 30 people applied for the role...when I left 3 years later and was helping with the administration for my replacement, the same post got about 120 applicants. However, actually showing you've read the person spec and writing your application to be very focused around the specific role and requirements gets you a long way. Check to see if your local NHS Trust and/or councils have their own staff bank, too - they often do, and that can be a good way to get a foot in the door via temp work.

Tell me exactly what control we give up by being a part of the EU that we haven't given up already by being part of the UK?  Defense spending? General taxation?  Welfare levels?  These are the gains we get by not being in the UK, that wont be affected by joining the EU.  

We also have the situation that in a few years England could decide unilaterally to take the whole UK out of the EU, I don't see it happening, but it could, even if everyone in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland votes to remain, but enough little Englanders vote to leave it doesn't matter what the other countries say, we're just chained to England whether we like it or not?

You are right to say that the UK negotiators will seek the best deal for themselves, as will the Scottish, believe it or not we have stuff that you are going to need in the long run, despite how it feels just now England is heading towards a water crisis, how valuable will iScotland's water resources be, or renewable energy potential, we have and unless action is taken by the UK soon, will continue to have the only port in the country capable of storing the UK's nuclear capability.

You also don't prove an accusation to be false, you merely reject the idea that it is true beyond all reasonable doubt, which is a fairly high standard of proof required. It is, of course, absolutely right that it should be this way. So I don't think that the accuser having several past ""false"" accusations stands up. I also think that the prosecution has their identity, and so they would know, and if they have a chain of such accusations, they might be less likely to bring the case to court.

I still disagree, because of what I mentioned in my previous post. To not grant an alleged victim anonymity is to deter them from coming forward at all. This has a longer term effect because it means that actual abusers are less deterred from abusing, because they know that their victim is very unlikely to come forward (they are unlikely to anyway!) because they wouldn't be able to deal with the stress of being publicly known with all of the baggage that comes with that.

2. We need this youth movement to pan out in a big way. MvG, Kalas, Lukaku, et al need to pan out and stick around. They save us money and become known entities.

Seriously, I can't tell if you're genuinely  oblivious or if you're so flat out dishonest and hoping that somebody won't notice, even your own comment is the center of the gender-specific thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1xsskd/domestic_violence_experienced_by_30_of_female/cfeaoxf ""(or visa versa)"" Wow that is a pathetic attempt at trying to remain egalitarian despite the fact that the comment was targeted at the female gender.

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1xsskd/domestic_violence_experienced_by_30_of_female/cfeb7ak 

Considering these two comments are the center of the 'discussion' your attempt at pretending gender isn't at the heart of this circlejerk is laughable.

&gt;They're not here

Yet in any other given thread related to an unfortunate event there is always sympathy.

&gt;We haven't got to accept the claim though. Lack of backing by evidence gives us another option: dismiss the claim. I'm not suggesting that domestic violence doesn't exist for a moment - I am saying that it's 100% appropriate to ask how this information was gathered and that doing so doesn't reflect in any way on any gender at all as (in asking the question) it affects both men and women and anyone else polled.

You're seriously claiming that the statistics are backed by no evidence? You're completely losing your grounding here, you accept the evidence or counter it. Criticising the evidence is fine provided that you accept that without any counter evidence, speculation alone  isn't sufficient to dismiss the claim.

You were making a false analogy. The differences between bike theft and sexual assault are:

* There is a fear when one is sexually abused that they might not be believed. This is because they are often not, particularly historically (think 40 years ago).

* When one suffers a sexual abuse, the first thing on one's mind is not talking to strangers (or even friends) about the fact. It is often like this when one suffers a traumatic experience, but sexual assault is particular because of victim blaming. The more natural response is to simply pretend it did not happen, to your friends, to the police (well, you don't contact them), and even to yourself. This is why memories of the events are often unclear.

Kenny Dalglish came out with a statement that revealed that Mrs Suarez calls her husband 'Negro' at home. One of Uruguay's most celebrated footballers is known as 'El Negro'. In Belgium, they have a prize called the 'Ebony Boot' which is a prize given to African footballers and decendants of African families. Is this institutional racism?""

The case gained additional notoriety because the killers made video recordings of some of the murders, with one of the videos leaking to the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). Two 19‑year-old locals, **Viktor Sayenko** ([Ukrainian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language): Віктор Саєнко, [Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Виктор Саенко) and **Igor Suprunyuck** ([Ukrainian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language): Ігор Супрунюк, [Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Игорь Супрунюк), were arrested and charged with 21 murders.

Which is, of course, not true. Or are you saying that there are at least as many homosexuals in this world as there are heterosexuals?

The point I am making is despite the media frenzy over this 'anti-gay' law it has nothing to do with persecuting homosexuals for being homosexual. It is all about keeping inappropriate ideas and images and media away from children. 

We like to think we are so hip in this country and so sussed when it comes to sexual education and yet we have endemic [teenage pregnancies](http://www.babyshower-activities.com/teenage-pregnancy-statistics-uk-2012.html) and distressing [amounts of sexually transmitted diseases](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/01/14/report-sexually-transmitted-disease-cases-increased-2012/). Of course it is the price you pay for not re-enforcing  traditional values and moral behaviour with civic duties and responsibilities. 

Seriously, put yourself in the shoes of a pious Russian Christian [(the majority of the population)](http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_christian.html) for a moment and imagine you are looking at the UK US Europe etc.. and seeing their problems with drugs, sexual promiscuity and fragmented families and ask yourself, is that really something you want to emulate?  What would you do to  prevent the same  immorality from poisoning your values and society?

I have Russian friends and I have a good understanding of how they see things when they look at the depravity that bleeds from our attempts to please everyone all of the time and not to offend anyone in the process. It is why most Russians don't care what the west says they are supposed to have done. More often than not, they misunderstand, misinterpret or flat our lie to make themselves seems morally superior. Something that is laughably ironic when it comes to places like the US.

I'm more than happy to continue talking if you have a new point to raise, but you are just repeating yourself now and it's getting boring. I have never claimed, implied or even seemed to want a conviction at any cost. Much the opposite, I have expressed my support of the idea that one needs to be assumed innocent unless a crime can be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The case against DLT was not strong enough and it is right that he walks free today. Same with Bill Roache, and I certainly am not going to work on the assumption that they are sexual abusers simply because they were accused of it once. My support has merely been in the status quo of how anonymity only works one way.

You however seem to think that a not guilty verdict is an automatic guilty verdict on the accusers, and as such they should have to pay the defendant's legal costs. This is simply absurd, unless it can be proven *beyond reasonable doubt*, the same standard of proof as would be needed for a conviction, that the accusers were making *false* accusations, i.e not simply an accusation which can not itself be proven *beyond reasonable doubt*.",0,1392315358,null,0,false,0,cfehcxb,t3_1xsx9i,t1_cfehcxb,t1_cfeh765,null,1432382585,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; • Domestic abuse: this category combines partner abuse (non-sexual), family abuse (non-sexual)
and sexual assault or stalking carried out by a current or former partner or other family member.

&gt;• Non-sexual abuse by a partner: physical force, emotional or financial abuse or threats to hurt the
respondent or someone close to them carried out by a current or former partner.

&gt;• Non-sexual abuse by a family member: physical force, emotional or financial abuse or threats
to hurt the respondent or someone close to them carried out by a family member other than a
partner (father/mother, step-father/mother or other relative).

&gt; • Sexual assault: rape or assault by penetration including attempts (‘serious’), indecent exposure,
sexual threats or unwanted touching (‘less serious’) carried out by any person.

&gt;• Stalking: one or more incidents (causing distress, fear or alarm) of receiving obscene or
threatening unwanted letters, e-mails, text messages or phone calls, having had obscene or
threatening information about them placed on the internet, waiting or loitering around home
or workplace, following or watching, or interfering with or damaging personal property by any
person, including a partner or family member.

Which would include emotional abuse that people seem to think doesn't count.

However:

&gt;The largest difference between the sexes was shown for sexual assault, with 19.1% of women and 2.7% of men having experienced sexual assault (including attempts) since the age of 16

Source: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_352362.pdf

On a side note, it seems strange to me that this stat is so hard to believe for some people. I went to a school that was moderately shitty and I can handily believe that 30% of the kids fathers were physically abusive.  No problem at all believing that it wasn't just the kids getting hit. Sure it's different to what the study measures but where does this sudden incredulity come from as soon as we talk about gender based issues that show women suffering? People got a post onto the front page yesterday that lied directly and was disproved in the first link it contained (the flappy bird/state of games journalism one if you were wondering) so how are we suddenly all acting like a panel of academic reviewers when the issue of violence towards women comes up?

Dear Mr 

 

Thank you for your email below about communications data. 

 

I believe that it is imperative that we get the balance right between upholding civil liberties and the right to privacy, and protecting the public by maintaining the ability of the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to access vital communications data.

 

Communications data is critical for the police in their fight against crime, including serious offences such as child abuse, drug dealing and terrorism. It has played a role in 95 per cent of all serious organised crime investigations and every major Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade. We need to be able to keep up with criminals as they shift to e-mails and the internet, rather than making phone calls.

 

The Government published draft proposals last year, which were scrutinised by the Intelligence and Security Committee and a joint committee of both Houses. The joint committee consulted widely on the proposed content, issuing a call for evidence from interested organisations and individuals last July. Both committees recognised the need to tackle the problem in legislation.

 

The Government is continuing to look at this issue closely, and will bring forward proportionate proposals to address this important issue in due course. I am reassured that the Government is committed to ensuring that law enforcement and intelligence agencies continue to have access to the communications data they need, with robust safeguards for civil liberties.

 

Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.

 

Yours sincerely,

 
Pauline Latham OBE MP

I think you'll find the generalised, prejudiced nature of the media is something universally despised and not something that women or anyone like me would benefit from in the grand scheme of things. However, no feminist has ever claimed or even implied that men don't suffer from DV; this is one of the ways the media incorrectly portray 'people like me'. 

I never came to this thread with any intention of talking about this subject anyway, my problem is with this subreddit in particular where men's issues are accepted here without any problem; there certainly isn't a lack of threads around male issues, including but not limited to male DV. A quick skim through the contents of the subreddit with a few key words should suffice. My problem is with the clear bias against women in the subreddit as a whole and that is reflected in the nature of the comments, where they hide behind their forced egalitarian comments (or sometimes openly biased comments) where they claim to be objective and not bring gender into the equation despite all evidence to the contrary.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"We do have the depth in certain roles, but they're provided by younger, more inexperienced players who wouldn't make a enough of an impact if they were included in the squad yet. **Gerrard** has settled comfortably into the defensive midfield role, so would provide enough back-up there for **Lucas** that I doubt we'd go searching for someone else for that position because they'd mostly be on the bench. 

The thing is *it all kind of hinges on whether we get CL football or not* in some way or another. If we do, or finish even further up, more first team, recognisably named talent will want to join us because they're guaranteed CL football for at least a season. This includes the possibility of **Luke Shaw**, **Konoplyanka**, the Argentinian forward **Vietto** (I mean, I'm sure he'd rather a team where he can realistically achieve regular football and not Real Madrid, where he'll most likely be a reserve striker just in case) and maybe even **Lallana**, who we've had our eye on for a while. If we don't get CL football, then our last three seasons will just repeat, and we'll be unable to bring in many players who can seriously improve the squad (we've been pretty lucky with Suarez, Sturridge and Coutinho!). 

The thing is, it also depends on which *other teams qualify for the CL or not*. One of the biggest PL rivals for foreign signings, Man Utd, may not even extend their run beyond 7th position and, if that happens, they'll find that big players are less likely to sign on the dotted line. It happened with Liverpool, and it'll happen with other teams, regardless of their financial situation or brand name.

You doing so while engaging in spin says otherwise. You could do a better job by being dispassionate and offering counterpoints *without* yelling about how everyone in the thread is a brutalising rapefiend!!1 for thinking ""actually that is a pretty severe headline, lets interrogate it"".

No particular case is being talked about here, just figures and charts, yet there is so much (and rightfully so) sympathy.

&gt;I am saying that it's 100% appropriate to ask how this information was gathered and that doing so doesn't reflect in any way on any gender at all as (in asking the question) it affects both men and women and anyone else polled. 

Yet again being completely inconsistent, you're jumping between dismissing the evidence (""We haven't got to accept the claim though. Lack of backing by evidence gives us another option: dismiss the claim"") and questioning the gathering of evidence. Oh and that bullshit again.

I know the feeling. Oh look this again:

&gt;This is not about gender. We are asking what standards were used to collect the information: what is defined as domestic violence in terms of the presented findings and how were those polled asked to provide this information? What was the wording? What was their understanding of the words ""domestic abuse"" - or was it whether they simply felt they had been victims or not?

I'm not so sure it is. After all, optimistically Scotland is only going to take on a roughly per capita share of the debt which is only 10%. And walking away from the debt would be tantamount to walking away from every single aspect of union in a sort of acrimonious divorce. It would arguably the leave the UK with any and all assets that are actually located in the UK or administered by the UK. That means almost all the military hardware, all the overseas materials and assets, all the embassies and state owned properties or land.

In essence what I am really getting at is that if it comes to a bullying match - the UK is a lot bigger than Scotland. Saying nothing of national character or anything that might upset people, the rUK has the size and economic diversity to absorb the punches an iScotland might try to throw its way regarding the debt... on the other hand Scotland is intrinsically going to be dependent on British support for their fledgling nation to actually gain access to markets and even basic infrastructure. Did you know for example that 75% of all goods entering the UK do so via the docks at Southampton including those destined for Scotland. The UK is effectively going to be in a strong position to bully the Scots into accepting just about any terms they offer.

I read the top comment tree, and then most of yours (til you two got all wall of texty). I saw a discussion. You see a circlejerk because you spend all your time in a circlejerk on these issues, so when you step out of it you dont like what you see. But to call it a circlejerk is mental avoidance, it doesn't conform to your worldview, so you give it a cursory scan and shout accusations of misogyny and male supremacist bias at it.

I just dont take you seriously im afraid. This is why a lot of BRDies use alts, like anonymous cowards like me, but i assure you, if you saw my history you'd see im not ignorant on the issues, and i am behind a lot of social justice issues, hence why i call out people going overboard, and becoming annoying and ineffective, like you.

&gt; rarely are these people so critical of reports on male abuse.

I thought a feminist would be the first one NOT to draw false equivalancies between genders. Men and women are different, and so is their perceptions in society. The conversation about womens issues is a lot more advanced than mens. And mens issues have been comparitively invisible til more recently, in fact we have internet feminism to thank for that in its recent rise to internet boiling point. That also means there is some reactionary MRA bullshit floating around as well, and its important we hold all statistics up to scrutiny, unlike the /r/MR circlejerk, who often fail pretty hard at that. But this isn't either, its a reflection of people reacting to a disparity between the visibility of gendered issues, and saying ""yeah, lets give the mens issues a listen"" and perhaps, you will see overeagerness to entertain them, this will likely last a while, but i think its because of the historic sacred cow of womens issues and its dominance of the spotlight compared to mens.

Also, again, not only is MRA fielding bullshit statistics, feminists have been fielding and social media has been viralizing shitty statistics, and when unthinking unquestioning circlejackers dont question them, you get an immune response in the skeptic crowd.

In short, you have a culture rise in interest in mens issues going on, and a skeptical kneejerk to how screechy feminism has been getting. Society reaps what it sows.

Sit back and enjoy the fireworks, or get in a huff. Personally i think you should assert your position, especially when it is naturally strong, in a well ordered and professional way.

When you're talking about forming a nation it is irresponsible to not treat the threats of the people who make the decision seriously.

You're right, *in and of themselves* these threats should not be disregarded. *But* if one takes into account strong recommendations from some very high level economists, the green light from the Treasury, the ambiguous wording of the speech itself and, apparently, a 70% approval rating in rUK it makes it seem more and more likely that the purpose of these threats is purely to affect the vote, and not a guarantee as to the behaviour of the UK, if Scotland goes independent.

&gt;Could Scotland be considered truly independent if its currency was still controlled at the whim of the larger country?

The whole point of independence is because Scots would be better off under Holyrood rather than Westminster. As such, if a currency union makes better economic sense than any other option than choosing any other option, purely because it would make us ""more independent"" is just stupid. Scots are not supporting independence for independence's sake.

Whilst ceding some power to the BoE may be an inevitability of a currency union, it still provides major benefits over joining the Euro, or setting up an independent currency (at the current time, this will probably change once the world economy has stabalised) and over the current situation; Scotland can leave a currency union much more easily, would have far easier trade with it's main trading partner and would also be insulated from Westminster's policies (Bedroom ""Tax"" etc.) and also would not have to pay more because of rUK's higher debt interest (due to heavily subsidised NI, Wales and the North of England.)

There is some information that is damaging if it were disclosed in open court, particularly where it is not in the public interest, where it would be damaging to individuals or where it would risk disclosing intelligence methods and capabilities.

Yes, but what *led* to the political situation was the way in which the IRA was systematically undermined and degraded by the actions of the Security Service and it's informants.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;What's in it for the rUK?

Easier trade with it's second largest trading partner, this relationship creates 700,000 jobs in rUK. Not having a currency union would slap an extra £500 million + of transaction costs a year on these businesses.

A currency union is supported by Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc, rejecting it would be detrimental to the UK economy, according to these banks.

An argument could be made that without a currency union, Scotland will not take a share of the UK's debt. Whilst this would lead to Scotland probably having higher borrowing costs, it would considerably damage the UK, who's debt as a percentage of GDP would still be 101% by 2016, and that is if Scotland *did* take some debt.

Scotch whisky adds £135 to the UK’s balance of payments every single second, and accounts for 25% of all UK food and drink exports.

&gt;If Scotland gets it wrong we would be obliged to bail out an independent country

Still a big ""if.""

&gt;give Scotland input into our nations fiscal policy when its already been stated that an independent Scotland wants to become a competitor

That applies just as much to rUK, it gives it a input into the fiscal policy of Scotland.

There was this thing, about 10 or 12 years ago, where lots of proprietary and niche software companies were offering ""solutions"" which required IE6.

This was when home internet access was still in a state of rapid adoption - I'm seeing figures of 60% of homes with broadband in 2005, but only 40% of homes with any kind of internet access in 2003.

Obviously NHS managers were not luddies, internet adoption was a big thing, but at the same time Microsoft were pushing this dot-Net ""works anywhere"" strategy to these vertical software providers.

The idea was that teleworkers would be able to log on to the NHS ""intranet"" whilst new desktops and users could be easily added in the hospital, just by plugging them in. You wouldn't need to install or update an application executable, because it all worked in the browser.

At the time I thought it really short-sighted that companies accepted this, but the Microsoft way of doing things was to write the software (which might be easily ported from the previous version of Visual Basic) in these Dot-Net frameworks and have it hosted on Windows Server (I guess Windows Server 2003 is when I became more aware of this).

This software stack was integrated top-to-bottom, requiring Internet Explorer 6, and any concerns about this (""what about HTML and web standards?"") were dismissed with a hand-waving gesture and ""oh, but IE6 is on every computer, it's what everyone's using anyway"".

I don't know for sure why Microsoft abandoned support for browser-based dot-Net in IE7 and IE8, but they did, and the rest is history.

I would dare to say that the NHS uses hundreds or thousands of different software packages - there are probably requirements for software certification when you're doing inventory management of 10,000 doses of opiates and ketamine. You probably can't shove this stuff in an Excel spreadsheet and you probably have to use some other specialist niche software when you're accounting for patient and bed numbers in multiple wards in multiple hospitals in a region.

Nurses and ward sisters alone probably have several different software programs they use; there's all sorts of bookings and accountings and records to be kept up and down the hospital hierarchy. 

I'm not defending how they got into this position, I'm just pointing out that it's damn hard to get out of it. I was one of those voices 10 years ago saying ""what about HTML and web standards?""

Firstly, I used to live near Northampton and know that if you want to commute to London you are, as has been pointed out below, better off living in Milton Keynes as you can catch a Virgin train from there that will have you in Euston in half an hour while an London Midlands train from Northampton will more than double that. Trust me, working in finance is going to mean long, long hours in the office so you'll want to reduce the time it takes to get home afterwards because you'll want to maximise the sleep you can get. There's plenty of travel options to get to Northampton at the weekends even if you don't drive while you're in the UK - there's the train, and there's the Stagecoach X6 if you fancy a scenic journey along the delightfully beautiful A5.

As for finance, I guess the type of salary you're going to get offered is going to be largely dependent on the role, your experience and your qualifications. The regulatory bodies for the finance sector differ in the qualifications they require you to have before you can assume certain roles. 

I recently joined an investment group as a financial coordinator with no relevant qualifications or experience but with the understanding that I can become a financial consultant in 2 years time as long as I study for, and pass, 5 exams (and a further 2 if I want to transfer to one of our US offices). I have no salary, I am paid purely on commission and that is dependent on the business that me and my consultant bring in together. If he earns £200k this year from clients that I've organised for him, I earn £40k. If he earns £150k from clients I've organised for him and £50k from clients he's set up for himself, I earn £30k. I have no idea what other types of financial jobs are out there, or what they offer, but it might be worth googling for recruitment agencies that specialise in your field and seeing what ads they're running as it'll give you an idea of the state of play.

What the hell do we do when we relocate a player?

Numerous clubs (and even more companies) employ relocation specialists (Lyon apparently is exceptionally good at this), the specialist's only job is to ensure the player that you just paid £5m or £15m or £50m for has the basics settled and off their plate about worrying so they can focus on the game.  They find a selection of houses for you, they arrange for the car to be taken care of, they find the school for your kids, they ensure that your favorite newspaper is available, they find the place in the city that sells the biscuits you like and the restaurant that serves your favorite dish, they ensure that your dog gets its favorite food AND they arrange language classes for you and your family.

Do Spurs do this? I would figure we do but......Lamela apparently still doesn't speak great english , i thought i saw that one of the newer signings was in a temporary flat.

My company, which doesn't pay anyone near as much as the Spurs players, has 4 relocation specialists to deal with people making £30k -£60k/year....i would hope Spurs pony up £45K-£60k/year for someone to help guys making £60k/wk settle in.",0,1392330208,null,0,false,0,cfeokyv,t3_1xu6ih,t1_cfeokyv,t3_1xu6ih,null,1432386270,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

I'm basing this purely on how we're going to use our assets and I absolutely assume Gerrard will continue to start next season.

That doesn't, however, mean I'm against a box to box top midfielder like Hendo who could move around with him.

At the same time, as I've said in numerous posts on this sub this season, we're at a strange time where we have some young guys coming through who could become full time internationals/team of the season types in Coutinho, Sterling, Henderson, Flanno, and on and on. 

If we buy a world class or could be there soon type, who are we dropping? Gerrard? Will Lucas even start? Will Coutinho? Henderson?

If we're in CL it'll mean we can rotate more but our young lads still have to be getting proper time to advance their careers. Right now we've also got Joe Allen, Alberto, Suso (even he's more likely to be a RW) coming back. 

I'm not saying an uptick in quality wouldn't benefit us right now. But it just has to be with a proper eye to the future. 

We aren't City. We aren't Chelsea. We aren't even Utd. We can't afford to just do the buy a player until he works out thing. We can't afford to just ship our youngsters off to West Brom.

Frankly speaking, we are a fucking blue print with Sturridge, Coutinho, Sterling, Henderson, etc, for what it means to give youth a chance. Sturridge, Sterling, and Henderson are all booking their planes to Brazil. 

I'm not shooting down the idea of rotation. I'm just saying that finding a player who actually fits the rotation and allows for youth to grow and for us to succeed day in and day out is really fucking difficult.",0,1392330666,null,0,false,0,cfeosy2,t3_1xs9l3,t1_cfeosy2,t1_cfeapzd,null,1432386376,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

What I'm saying is we have set up our team right now with Gerrard as our pivot. If you've heard BR speak you know this was a long term plan and he thinks could keep Gerrard around for 2-3 more years. Believe me, I have been fucking thundering on about getting a backup DM since last year while other fuckers were talking about lineups out of FIFA. It's absolutely the most important position in a team.

But right now with our squad depth we've got Gerrard and Lucas owning that role. Say we rotate them a bit. There's still no reason to think we'll be playing without one of them on. Then you've got Joe Allen who might actually thrive with a more defensive back 4 in the DM position. 

I think we need an athletic box to box type capable of rotating with Hendo and Coutinho. Hopefully it could be a top player.

But my only point is you look at a team for it's weaknesses. Until recently I'd have said our tactical approach meant we needed a top DM or at least a capable backup. Right now I'd put solidifying our defense as priority number one. I'd put signing a 3rd striker as number 2 (which is fucking easier said then done and we've also got Aspas and Borini who could actually rotate and offer something next year), and our midfield as number 3.
