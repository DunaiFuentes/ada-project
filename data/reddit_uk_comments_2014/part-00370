The problem isn't the loan ratio it's the wage to house price ratio which is the problem. Consider that many mortgage repayments are similar to rent payments and if I could buy a house for £100K, then I could take out a 100% £100K loan and pay it back easily within my lifetime. 

The problem is a combination of the lack of housing supply, public transport infrastructure and distribution of employment areas.

I've lived in some really nice and affordable areas in the UK, but there weren't many jobs.

Now I live near a major employment centre, and the distribution of housing prices is very much oriented around better transport routes.

A lot of people commute from Cambridge to London, and the prices of the apartments near the train station in Cambridge are simply eye watering for what you get.

For quiet crossings or anywhere else in the UK (apart from London which has it's own rules) go when it's clear. I work in roadworks and the usual rule of thumb (not necessarily of law) is that if it's carriageway, cars have right of way... Sometimes, even against traffic cones. Cross when it's clear, and although you should never run across a road (increased chance of falling when you will be less visible to drivers and therefore more at risk), you should walk swiftly. Continue checking both directions (even on one way streets because there is always at least one complete idiot driving the wrong way), and where possible, use the pedestrian crossings, especially in rural areas where traffic moves faster.

My final piece of advice concerns trams. Please treat trams (and buses) with the same caution you would use for trains. They are big and stop slowly. If you step out in front of one, trams can't swerve around you and they probably can't stop in time. This isn't about right of way, this is about self-preservation.

false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I think part of the problem is, if you were in a hospital a doctor would critically assess you - are you lying, concealing things, whats the 'bigger picture' - to try to get a holistic view of your health.

ATOS assessments seem to be more akin to a driving test, with someone who is just there to tick the boxes on a sheet. It's actually not unheard of for someone to go in for their assessment and only get asked a single question.

The problem isn't that so much, I mean if you are going to re-evaluate every sick person in the country routinely you need a way to do it quickly, and the 'driving test' style is nothing if not quick. The problem for me is that people who are ill are used to having doctors with professional judgements, they're used to being talked to and options about health discussed with an expert. 

Then they get into the ATOS assessment maybe expecting the same, to be able to explain like they would to a doctor. But it's just a desk-jockey ticking boxes on a computer. If instead people were told ""its a bit like a driving test - lasts about 20 minutes just the same - they'll ask you questions, if you get so many points in one area or any big points they'll ask you to go on JSA"".

I suppose though, unlike driving tests, there isn't an army of 'ATOS instructors' who teach you what you need to know to pass the test, who tell you the tricks where examiners will try to catch you out and rehearse your answers, who reassure you that even if found fit for work, the appeals process is straightforward and has a massive success rate.

We don't live so close, and are not around each other nearly enough to provide an effective controlling influence over anyone who starts to play up. It could be months before the message of someone's inappropriate actions gets through the social grapevine.

You're describing a scenario where there is a high degree of oversight by people you know, and that they have the power to change your actions. This isn't the case for most people. I was also deliberate in mentioning anonymity above. Confronting friends is very different to an unknown assailant.

Additionally, the idea of confronting someone is only an option if you have strength in numbers, and are safe in the knowledge that you will not lose out in the exchange.

Example: A father out with a young child is not going to confront someone he knows from work as he throws a brick through a shop window. He has too much to risk, with his child there, and his health is important for the well-being of the child. Plus, it's not his window. He's also not going to collect a group of friends and start a confrontation with better odds, he's just going to leave.

You need a force of people who can enforce rules. Who have the ""monopoly on violence"". Who can confront people when you don't have strength of numbers yourself, or the organisation to tackle a larger problem.

You said above, you personally don't need laws to behave. If I had stockpiled food for my family, and you had none for yours, how many days would you wait before you tried to take some from me? (I can't feed everyone who asks, so I've made my decision not to share at all.)

These ""post-apocalyptic"" scenarios play out in a lot of sci-fi and horror literature. The main character is rarely a bad guy, instead he has morals to guide his judgement. The anonymous mob on the other hand has strength in numbers, violence and willingness to use swift action against an opponent. This is close to the ""animal instinct"" some biologists describe. It's a more base drive, that fight-or-flight mechanism which kicks in during stress and is powered by adrenalin.

Nothing.

How much of a minority? Plenty of people on all income levels use drugs (not alcohol/nicotine). 

Let's assume that people will always use drugs. A certain number may give them up if they can't afford them, but we do know that a lot of people will rob and steal to buy drugs. It's possible that this income would reduce this drug related crime.  

At this point you could ponder the overall cost (material cost, social cost, law enforcement cost) of drug related crime.

Seriously, the cost to benefit ratio of HS2 is the problem with me. shaving a couple of minutes off journey times and increasing frequency isn't good enough, it would have been more profitable if they moved the line's northern end further north to Manchester or further. All it would do for Birmingham is drag more business from them because instead of having to be based in Birmingham for their workers they can commute there. If it was sufficiently far away from London it would be more viable.

I understand the eventual plan is to extended further north but Birmingham is too close to london to really have any benefit. The holy grail, as the HS2 people claim from time to time, is the Scottish Central Belt, but that won't happen any time soon. HS2 is basically another project to benefit London.

Now do you know why everything in London is chaos in transport terms. It's because we've shoved all our eggs in one basket. The golden eggs are not the result of magic but constant investment. businesses go here because they want a London address for prestige and the masses of infrastructure attracts them there more as opposed to places like Manchester, a place with decent infrastructure but no prestige. Other cities struggle to get even toned down, simple projects done like BRT or reopening old railway lines whereas London gets what it wants, and we fucking hate it. The reason London is doing so good is they ride on the back of all the money they get and we're now at the point where to keep up with the transport demands alone we need to spend tens of Billions to just make things better.

No other comparable country does this. Seriously, Germany has multiple centres, France does too, we are literally the only country punching ourselves in the balls keep the status quo.

Might be worth checking out Tesco too. They offer SIM Onlys for both 12 months and 1 month. Neither has unlimited data, but you can get up to 3gb data allowance per month.

false,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,"How disappointing. This seems to be saying that the Equality Act isn't a legal obligation if you're a bus company. I don't get the reasoning Lewison is putting forward. If other companies still have to show 'reasonable adjustment' under the act, why not bus companies?

It's a fair point that you can't legislate to make companies responsible for the behaviour of their customers, but you can legislate to make customers act in a socially appropriate manner, and this is what the Equality Act ought to do. If a wheelchair user is discriminated against, then the person doing the discriminating ought to be held liable.

First Bus have a policy of requesting passengers with buggies vacate wheelchair spaces when needed, this is reasonably enlightened of them, up here in my neck of the woods, Arriva Buses have a 'first come first served' policy which only this weekend just gone resulted in my daughter spending 20 mins freezing waiting for a bus because the driver refused to allow her to board because a buggy was occupying the wheelchair space, despite the fact that the parent with the buggy folded the buggy to make room when she saw a teenager in a powerchair out in the cold.

The driver stated his fear that he'd 'get his neck snapped' if he asked anyone to move as his reason, indicating he'd had unpleasant experiences with truculent passengers in the past. It's against the law to snap people's necks. No matter if they are on a bus or not. But it's only against the law to fail to make reasonable adjustment for the disabled if they're not on a bus. Big difference between neck snapping and having to wait in the cold for another bus, but though the process of identifying an individual who'd refused to move, let alone chasing them through the courts would be a right pain, a couple of test cases would serve to improve this kind of legal ambiguity a lot more than the result of this appeal.

Having access to a lump sum that needs to be returned in a year has no impact with any lenders because it provides no ability for you to repay.

The fact is that if you earn £36,000 per year you cannot afford to mortgage a £250,000 property. Your monthly take home (with no provision for a pension or any other benefit) is £2,280: a £250,000 mortgage with a 90% LTV would be a minimum monthly payment of £1,250 *before* interest rates rise, that's close to 60% of your take home pay and that's also *before* the costs of owning a property (incl. service charges for a flat!) -- and you don't even have the £25k deposit required for a 90% LTV.

Bit of a summery of the latest bits and pieces to cross my path, that will tie in a bit with some of these rumours.

Priorities are now, CF, CB, WF in that order. We are hoping for three but only expecting 2, the third player will only come in if we can move enough players out.

Moreno the most likely to happen as it suits all parties and he wants to join. The other CB's mentioned in the OP I have not heard mentioned but obviously we will have back up options so who knows, if Moreno should fall not happen.

Rodriguez is almost certainly a no until the Summer because of the secondary injury, I have already posted about. Still has no intention of signing the Saints deal that has been on the table for months.

Schniedy is very expensive, unless things change financially, or we get another player sales windfall [​IMG] there is no chance of this happening.

Martinez I was told no chance now.

Mitrovic we were very interested in, but with the likes of Juve sniffing we have little chance.

Berhaino is overpriced for what he has so far achieved, we have enquired but value is far better elsewhere. Mitchell has been brought in for a reason, and it is not to pay way over the odds for obvious players.

There are only a dozen or so players that are seen to have a future in Poch's long term plans. Everyone else is surplus and will be moved on if we can.

Holtby has to decide his future very shortly. Ze Germans activated the buy clause in his contract months ago so now it is purely down to him. We no longer have a say in the matter. Was also told though had he stayed he would 100% have seen game time under the manager, and he has been told this(make of that what you will).

There is interest in quite a few outgoings, but nothing solid for anyone yet. Clubs know we are willing sellers in almost every position though, so as an agent put it ""expect most of the outgoing movement to happen late on in the window as our lot are used as fall back option's"".

IMO it will be Moreno plus a youngish striker in January(no names there though as yet) and that is it. A winger would be a bonus, but the resurgence of Lennon of late means we are less desperate than in other area's. Of course certain player sales will mean that things change and for instance the sale of Lamela would mean a more pressing need for a WF.

Also told to expect more player swapping deals to emerge as clubs try to circumvent FFP.


Thought I'd save the best till last.......

Hugo is very happy with life in London and at the club. As long as we show we are moving in the right direction he wants to stay, He sees a very good young squad that can grow as one and really be something special. He really likes the manager and has bought into his plans hook line and sinker, as it is very close to his own philosophies on the game. If we back the manager, and look to be making forward steps Hugo will stay put.

* As soon as you realise it's a nuisance call, ask for the name of the company like you're interested, then ask for the name of the agent you're talking to.

* Tell them you don't ever want to hear from them again and that you're going to report them to TPS as you're registered on there (if you're not then make sure you get on there). 

* If they try to say they don't want to sell you anything so they're not breaking the rules explain that it doesn't matter, they're still breaking the law and they might get fined. Make sure you actually report them too. 

* If at any time they hang up, you have their company name find their contact details and call them back to continue the questioning.

Not only would you earn less but you'd have to pay for childcare which is going to take a *massive* chunk out your already reduced money.

Should this country adopt more of the old post-war frugal spirit? Absolutely. However we need to also accept that we've created an economy where first it's difficult to get a job, second a full time job might not support a family and third there's people like you slandering folk for finding themselves in these predicaments. 

Don't judge people because they're having a hard time of it, fix the systems that make it hard for them. Do you think people *don't want* financial security, a car, a holiday, a fridge full of fresh food?

&gt; Amy Kimbangi who runs Tower Hamlets Trussell Trust Food Bank says the Trussell Trust choose to limit food vouchers because they do not want visitors to become reliant on food aid.
&gt; 
&gt; “While we want to help those in crisis situations, we keep food aid short so people don’t become too dependent on our support,” Amy explains.
&gt; 

Just to correct my earlier post, the Trussell trust limits clients to 3 vouchers in a 6-month period. Not all foodbanks require limits on donations however.

Basically, no matter how the system worked I would have to spend at least some time trying to acquire said benefits. During this time I would be running on my savings, feeling incredibly stressed etc.

The point of basic income is the idea that no matter what happens you have immediate access to a liveable (if only just) income. This means you can't be kicked off the system.

If you have any restrictions on a system then some people will be missing out on benefits they deserve. The question is whether the cost of people abusing the system is worth the cost of these people suffering.

&gt; Do you mean the personal allowance? 

Yes, it was really frustrating me that I couldn't think of it's name! I didn't actually know that it reduced after £100k. That 20K over the £100K is taxed hard given that. I think that ""little"" block of money gets an equivalent tax of 60%.

But yeah, while it could be sorted out with different tax rates it would end up hitting the rich harder (While I believe this necessary, I also find it sad) when they could be paying out less if basic income wasn't provided over a certain level.

I suppose it depends what the end goal is. The most important aspect of basic income, as I've said before, is the immediate access with no restrictions. No bizarre job contracts to require payment, no way to actually lie to the system (you can waste your money, but you can no longer acquire it illegally). It's designed to reduce stress and let people live when they have to sort out their lives.

&gt;The __American robin__ (*Turdus migratorius*) is a [migratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration) [songbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird) of the [thrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird\)) family. It is named after the [European robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_robin)  because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin belonging to the [Old World flycatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_flycatcher) family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico) and along the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean) Coast. It is the [state bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_birds) of [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut), [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan), and [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin).  According to some sources, the American robin ranks behind only the [red-winged blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-winged_blackbird) (and just ahead of the introduced [European starling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_starling) and the not-always-naturally occurring [house finch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_finch)) as the most abundant, extant land bird in [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America).  It has seven subspecies, but only *T. m. confinis* of [Baja California Sur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Sur) is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts.

&gt;The American robin is active mostly during the day and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet consists of [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate) (such as [beetle grubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva), [earthworms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm), and [caterpillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar)), fruits, and [berries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry). It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It is among the first birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.

Then run through the loan with an interest rate of 3.0% and demonstrate that Sally has made money on the loan.  Since Sally is charged by the government with not profiting on the loans for higher education, Sally has to charge interest at the same rate of inflation.

If necessary, run through the loan at 1.5%, and parallel it with the cost of bread at the same time, demonstrating that Sally hasn't made or lost money on the loan, and thus neither has she.

&gt; &gt; The main growth of foodbanks in Germany began 2005, when Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s government introduced the “Agenda 2010” of tax cuts, and cuts to pension and unemployment benefits. Around the same time, a new form of unemployment insurance (“Hartz IV”) was introduced, reducing previous benefit levels and the duration for which they can be received.

&gt; Canada

&gt; &gt; The key factor at the root of the need for food banks is low income, whether in the short or long term. People asking for help are working in low-paying jobs, receiving meagre social assistance benefits, managing on inadequate pensions. They face rising costs related to food, housing, and energy.

&gt; Holland

&gt; &gt; We are seeing the effects of the crisis. These people are out of work, they have little money and a lot of debts. The government is reducing the welfare benefits too, so people have to come here.

&gt; Spain

&gt; &gt; The picture remains extremely worrying for those who have been looking for a job for over 12 months, with only 13% of them finding a new job in the three months to September, while those who have been unemployed for longer face an even harder battle.

&gt; &gt; Over 2.4m Spaniards have been out of a job for more than two years – the period after which unemployment benefits run out – and, bar a couple of minor initiatives, there is not another government support to replace the jobless payments.

I used to fly fixed-wing IC, and electric flight was still not affordable or as practical as it has become in recent years. Consequently, most people were registered with the BMFA and had the benefits of tutorship and insurance as they could only take part in the hobby at clubs.

I'm all for the newer toys and greater accessibility, and I'm going to be joining the electric 'copter crowd soon.

Kiting is another one - I always make sure when I'm flying my kite that my BKFA insurance details are kept with my kit and my member number visible. I think it's important to promote responsible use.

Not one single party in this country thinks food poverty and starvation rations are a priority. We are all bickering over the EU and mansion taxes while no one outside of the charitable sector are doing anything for people who are starving. I don't care if no Government has succeeded I just want one to damn well try. 

But hey, you keep defending the Tories as no worse than anyone else. You're right, there isn't a political party that can sort this in Britain right now because none of those that can win care and you couldn't give less of a shit about that. For as long as you don't think it's imperative that they start to care and start to do something about this they won't. That's where your morals have gone off and where you become part of the problem. it matters more that the Tories aren't to blame than that there are people starving because people are always going to be starving. People are always going to be murdered so why do we bother with police to stop them?

There is a system that can sort this though, what it takes is to cut through the bullshit about scroungers, immigrants, the lazy and the young. To start saying that everyone in the country being fed is our number one priority, if we stop trying to take people out of the benefit system and cut them off with nothing for not following a set of arcane rules that help no one anyway. Then we could do something about this.

For as long as we try to pass moral judgement on whether someone deserves food (or the money to buy it) we will have people fall into that group who we can all agree shouldn't be there. The system you're looking for is called a guaranteed minimum income, not a minimum wage, an income.

We currently run a huge current account deficit, since we import lots of our energy and goods.  If the government were to also run a surplus then *where would the money come from to afford the trade deficit*?  Well, both the government surplus and the trade deficit would have to be financed by the private sector (that is you and me).  How would we finance that?  By going into debt, of course, since all money is now created as debt.  However given that the last recession was a balance sheet recession, caused by the private sector having too much debt and trying to delever, this would have been a disaster.  Trying to run a current account deficit and a government surplus with a highly indebted private sector is suicide.

Justice is about crime. If the person who is involved is committing a crime and that crime has a sentence that is attached to it then it should be applied. 

If this person's intent was to commit acts of terror in this country then the sentence given to them should be in proximity to the person who commits a similar crime.

The only mitigating circumstances are the plea and the facts of the case that could allow for the defendant's actions in terms of mental health, self-defence, remorse, contrition and certain specific cases. In fact, a plea of guilt should be taken into account as an act of remorse - because a) they encourage the guilty to seek it via a  lesser sentence and b) a moral admission of guilt is in of itself an indication that the defendant is willing to redress society. 

So, if all men are equal, one person planning to cause acts of terror in this country should be equally dealt with by the law.  The admission of guilt should be read as an admission of remorse and regret.

no they are not.

armed police are starting to do regular duties due to cutbacks, which means you see them more often, but there has been no increase in armed police officers, despite what exaggerations news organisations love to proclaim.

UK
Representation at parliament 18/650 = 3%.
3% * 2,523,216 (millions of USD) = 75696.5 as NI's share of GDP in the UK

ROI

Say representation is 33% (population of NI compared to the whole of Ireland is closer to 30%) 
33% * 232,150 (millions of USD) = 77383 as NI's Share of GDP in a united Ireland.

Not much in it really, and this is being generous to ROI, that extra 3% makes a difference.

There are some major issues with this analysis however, it doesn't take into account the Barnett formula, but its on its way out anyway. 

The population numbers used for the NI population were 2014 estimates while whole Island figures were 2011 census data, this gave a slight bias in NI's favour as population increased.

This assumes that a united Ireland doesn't have any major effects on the Irish economies, trade within the island is not taxed anyway.

It doesn't take into account the deficit NI is run at, and the amount of tax we generate, so in this case we assume NI only spends as much as it generates. Which it doesn't, and thus the GDP figure for Ireland doesn't change when it's added in, Wikipedia puts Ni's GDP at about 37 billion euro for a 2002 estimate (the above were IMF stats from 2013) which does make a bit of difference to the total making 78583 as NI's cut.

It also doesn't make any consideration for the different tax regimes, or the cost of living .

So in conclusion I'm not sure the economics of current figures are enough to sway me either way, but once you account for the tax differences, cost of living, and a handful of other political issues its a no from me.

So let's say a worker at McDonald's gets paid minimum wage. He's just finished uni and wants to earn some money while he looks for a long-term job. 

Getting Basic Income, he could say ""Stuff your job, Mickey D, I am going to apply for something that better suits me"". So, McDonalds would have to either pay him more or make the work conditions cushier. 

Having to pay their workers a minimum of £10 an hour (or perhaps more?) to keep them on board would mean they have to increase the cost of the burgers. 

Now Johnny B. Income comes into the McDonalds with his freshly charged bank card with £6 out of his £1,000 to spend. He finds the price of burgers has gone up by 15%. Therefore, in McDonalds, the £6 he would normally spend gets him only a Crappy Meal and not the McCardboard burger meal he usually likes. 

Now you could imagine this across several industries which employ cheap labour, especially retail and restaurants. 

Doesn't introducing Basic Income mean the money is worth less upon its introduction? Does this have the possibility of either spiralling out of control (i.e. government has to increase BI, which increases the phenomenon I just described, loss of consumer confidence, government having to borrow/make cuts, George Osborne cancelling Christmas in a drug-fuelled haze) or simply not being very effective at helping the poor pay their costs?

Sorry, but this is pure unsubstantiated opinion based on vague ideology.

Yes, food banks don't fix the macro-economic issues that force people to them. No shit.

Similarly, food banks won't help with long term poverty issues, which require deeper and more complex intervention. No shit.

But to suggest that crisis intervention has no impact on individual peoples' lives is complete bollocks. Getting rid of safety nets drives people into long term poverty and crime. For the majority of people in this situation, they need a break to help them turn their lives around. It's bloody hard to think of anything long or medium term when you're hungry.

Instead of arrogantly stating that these things don't help based on some blather that you reckon, why not go and find genuine supporting quantified evidence that investing this money is wasted and it doesn't help people turn their lives around.

Also my mortgage company seems pretty chilled about payment holidays up to the amount we've overpaid. (e.g. if we've overpaid £4k they'd let us miss around 3 months).

Compare putting money in a savings account to overpaying your mortgage: savings account might give 2% interest, while overpaying your mortgage means you avoid being charged 5% interest. So if your immediate needs are met (emergency fund) then overpaying your mortgage might well be the best investment you could make. 

If someone came up to you with a *riskless* way to earn 6% on your money, then overpaying your mortgage would be a bad investment, because you could just put your spare money into this 6% investment then when that matures pay off more of your mortgage than you would have done if you had put the money directly into the mortgage.

However when you think about your mortgage, it might not stay at 5% for ever - 
there is a risk (and this is what you're worried about) that the rate could go higher.  

To get an idea of what could happen with mortgage rates, have a look at what they were like in the 80s. 10% wasn't exactly unheard of.

Your monthly payment probably goes up by something in the region of £100 for each 1% increase in your repayment rate.

The [official report into the leak](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/199242/sanctions-report.pdf) (which is, of course, no less biased than any other source) concedes that the email was genuine, but states ""We found no evidence of a secret national regime of targets or of local regimes to that effect.""

It also says ""we have found a limited number of instances where a local manager has misinterpreted the instructions or has fallen back on target methodology in an effort to exercise their responsibilities to ensure the law is being properly applied.

If anyone has seen any Palace games over this season they'd know that they love to pack the midfield with 3 CMs and full backs who come into that zone too. On top of that Chamakh drops very deep and the out balls are always to the wingers who are the main threat.

This is a massive issue for us because we were effectively playing a two man midfield for most of the game (Three when either Lamela or Eriksen would drop in) and while we still dominated possession we couldn't pass through their block effectively (combination of too slow and no space because of their 5/6 in there). Not only did that mean our only real way of scoring (playing through the middle of the park) was pretty seriously nullified but our wings were also somewhat weakened because one of either Eriksen/Lamela kept coming inside and not offering help with Bolassie/Zaha (who despite Palace's reputation are both excellent traditional wingers).

The thing is if Poch had done his research he'd have realised that the teams who have a more direct style and bypass this midfield zone (either by going around it with widemen or over it with longer balls) have had much more success against Palace. Hull, Villa and West Ham have seriously outplayed Palace (3 wins) and more technical passing teams have struggled. Between Swansea, Tottenham, Liverpool and Arsenal only 4 points have been taken and the Arsenal win came from an incredibly late Ramsey winner which, on the balance of play, was undeserved.

Obviously Pochettino is quite similar to Wenger in that he wants his team to subscribe to his philosophy and play a certain way but I think there was some pretty big mistakes that raise some questions about his ability to prepare for matches.

If you saved this amount consistently for the next 10 years, and invested in a low-cost index fund like Vanguard LifeStrategy 80% for average returns (7%/year adjusted for inflation), you'd be looking at a nest egg of about 275,000GBP at the age of 36. You would then be able to withdraw 10,000GBP/year in passive income for the rest of your life, assuming a safe withdrawal rate of 3.6%/year. This is enough for some people to retire on.

If you only saved this amount for the next two years, but left it untouched in investments, the 50,000GBP would compound to about 355,000GBP by the time you reached 55, providing with you with a income of 12,800GBP/year - even if you had never saved another penny for the rest of your working life.

As I understand it, you could continue to avoid all debt (why choose to pay a mortgage if you're living rent free and you could buy a house in cash in a few years anyway?) and invest everything beyond a small emergency fund so that it can compound into untold riches and you never have to worry about money again.

No, that's stupid, we're still pretty big regardless. We have one city with everything and other cities with barely anything, and people seem to not only be OK with this but actively support it?

We're spending fuck tonnes of money in infrastructure for a problem that is outpacing us because we're putting all our eggs in one city whilst other cities with lots of potential get little help to attract businesses or improve infrastructure.

false,Jayesar,flair8,,"Tottenham’s goalless draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon was bitterly disappointing.  Having seen the green shoots of evolution that were so visible against Everton, it was disheartening to watch the side slump back down to its underwhelming average just seven days later.

The more things change, the more things stay the same: the White Hart Lane crowd was its usual self, tutting and hand-wringing inside twenty minutes – but that’s a battle which can’t be won.  There’s a never-ending dispute between fans who think that the team is obligated to provoke a reaction and those who believe a reaction is needed to provoke the players.

Both parties are so utterly convinced of their own veracity in that debate, that there’s little-to-no point in holding it anymore.

Hopefully though, there’s less of an even split over the treatment of Erik Lamela.  The Argentinian’s substitution was sarcastically cheered at half-time and, although the 22 year-old continues to struggle with his maturation, it’s baffling that anyone truly believes that audible derision is any way productive.

Lamela is frustrating.  He takes too many touches.  He doesn’t release the ball quickly enough.  He doesn’t judge attacking situations particularly well.  He’s a liability in defence.

Nobody disputes any of that.

But he’s learning the game.  Young players improve by making mistakes or giving poor performances and every minute he spends on the pitch is analysed, dissected and then used by the Tottenham technical staff to coach him in a positive direction.

Lamela is not a high-percentage player and he never will be.  If Spurs are ever to see a £33m return on their investment, it will because they’re able to find a compromise between his raw ability and their collective philosophy.  Their aim here is not to mould him into a formulaic footballer who passes the buck in possession, but a player upon whose shoulders results ultimately sit.  Those kind of players are very special and those kind of players take time to build.

It’s a tough balance. So much of Lamela’s game is based on instinct, that not only do Mauricio Pochettino and his staff have to teach him a new set of tactical instructions, but they also have to break-down and rebuild the set of traits which the player’s game has, until now, been built on.

Translate that into a real-life comparable:  think about how long it takes to abandon a habit and replace it with something new.  It doesn’t matter whether it’s an exercise regime, brushing your teeth with your right hand instead of your left, or the tendency to hold onto a football longer than you should.

It takes time to become embedded.

Maybe there’s some validity to the expectation that his progress would be quicker, but this isn’t as simple as sitting him down in a classroom, telling him what he should be doing, and then assuming that he will follow those instructions to the letter the next time he steps onto the pitch.

Neither, really, is this is a change which can be enacted solely on the training-ground.  Part of any player’s development occurs in live situations and in front of fans and, as such, a talent has to be allowed the latitude to make mistakes, to play badly, and to learn from the experience.

Pochettino cannot just hide him away on a practice pitch until he’s ‘ready’, because if he does then that point will never be reached.  Development is about learning, but it’s also about exposure.

This is tougher for a Lamela-type than it would be for a more orthodox player.  Tottenham paid what they did for him because of his potential to be a match-winner.  He’s an expressive talent who is theoretically at his most effective when doing things which are high-risk.  This isn’t a central-midfield whose job it is to simply retrieve and recycle the ball, this is a luxury item with whom the margins between brilliant and wasteful are always likely to be minute.

Inevitably, the development phase with someone like that is always likely to be more difficult to tolerate.  Lamela is an easy target for fans because he gives the ball away a lot and his inefficiencies are that much more glaring than those of his teammates, but this is a process which he, the fans, and his manager all have to suffer through if they want the long-term pay-off.",0,1418056464,null,0,false,0,cmot834,t3_2onk45,t1_cmot834,t1_cmot3ql,null,1425541332,21,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,21

Beyond that, the likes of Son, Volland, maybe Kruse, maybe Icardi (though he's a huge tool), and players like that can also fit.  I don't think any of them are going to be as good as a lone forward when the situation calls for it though. Lacazette's versatility is just nuts, he can play on either flank, alone up top, or with a partner.  He's pacey, clinical, technically strong, and creative as well, basically Sturridge 2.0.

Here's the thing though, if we do have any money to spend, this is absolutely the most important position for us to spend it on.  We've looked like utter garbage going forward because there's no spark without Sturridge.  Another player who can force us into motion is what we're looking for.  Sterling, Coutinho, and Lallana can only do so much when they have nothing going on in front of them to play with.  Lucas has helped sort out midfield and defense out, and we're probably going to stick with Mignolet until the end of the season.  As much as a DM would be nice, Lucas is able to do the job plus Can and Allen can cover for him if he gets injured, we're safe enough there.

I doubt FSG will be excited about giving BR a pile of cash for *another* forward after how many he's brought in that have failed, but if we stop looking for the cheeky deal leading us into a risky player and just pay for what we need, I think we'll end up with a successful transfer.",0,1418056585,null,0,1418056780,0,cmotae3,t3_2ombdx,t1_cmotae3,t1_cmop0e0,null,1425541302,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I would put serious money on Vargas scoring more goals than Keane. Vargas is well settled into the club and has scored when played up front for QPR and scores plenty of goals for his national side in that position.

Another option would be to acquire a decent right-back, allowing Isla to play in his natural right-wing position, then allowing Vargas to play up-front.... that way you have two quality young players, who have a natural pairing playing in their naturally strongest positions - As this is a logical and natural thing to do I bet Harry will do all in his power to prevent it from happening, until he has no choice.

If you want to find out if a company is a legitimate market research company, the MRS have a freephone number (0500 39 69 99) that you can call up to check if the company that called you is registered with them.

They also have their own complaints procedure which can be found here - https://www.mrs.org.uk/standards/how_to_complain

That said, with any legitimate market research company, the best thing that you can do if you don't want to receive any more calls from them is to ask to be added to their 'Do Not Call' list. This is slightly different to being taken off the calling list because they may have multiple lists to which you've been added. Sometimes the person who's calling you may not know about the DNC list, in which case it's always a good idea to ask to speak to a supervisor and get them to add your details to the list.

All the Apollo moon walkers reported that moon dust smells like ""**burnt** gun powder"". Big difference. Fry claimed that the particular combination of minerals makes them smell like that. That's completely wrong. After each Moon walk when the astronauts returned into the Lunar module and re-pressurized their cabin, the massive amounts of moon dust that stuck to their space suits would give off a very intense smell of burnt gun powder, but only for 20 minutes or so (which Fry didn't mention). After that they would lose all smell and be completely odorless (like you would expect from the inert stone minerals that make up the moon's surface). Why is that? 

The currently accepted theory is that the extremely fine mineral dust on the moon's surface is bombarded for millions of years by electrically charged solar particles. This electrically charges the surfaces of those fine dust particles. When they get introduced into the atmosphere of the re-pressurized lunar module cabin their electrical charge makes the particles smell like burnt gun powder when they get into contact with the olfactory receptors in the human nose. After 20 minutes the contact with the atmosphere in the cabin makes the dust lose its electrical charge and it then behaves like normal stone mineral dust does, i.e. it doesn't smell at all.

We haven't really used set common law punishments for many years, sentencing guidelines are just that and like most civilized societies we rely heavily on the discretion of the judge and/or jury, who may or not be informed by previous cases as another influencing but not overriding factor.

There's no requirement to give someone 9 years because of a case that happened under different circumstances to a different person in a different place, even if the charge was ultimately the same. That's comical and absurd to suggest! How quickly do you think a defense barrister would rip that reasoning to shreds if it meant slashing a possible decade in prison for his client?

What's more, this is fair. It is fair to give someone access to the judgement of their peers and/or a seasoned judge, whose job is to look at all the facts in what might be a complex case and decide appropriate punishment, or to acquit.

What's not fair is reading too many newspapers and deciding on the very limited facts  that you know that any two cases are identical and must proceed on exactly the same lines to the same conclusion. Because that really represents equality before the law?!? 

No, it represents a pining for an idealised justice system that lacks complex understanding or adaptability and takes the moral responsibility for sentencing away from the judiciary  and your fellow citizens and pushes it into the political sphere.

My feelings on the matter are that high street shops need to take advantage of the things that only they can provide, and be conscious enough of their image to overcome the barrier to participation that many shops seem to willingly cultivate. When I'm in town and I want a snack, I'm far more likely to go into a Tesco Express or similar, not because I think the quality will necessarily be better than some corner shop or another, but because I know what to expect; a certain standard of clarity in pricing and display, and of cleanliness, which I don't expect from the corner shop.

Do people choose supermarkets over local greengrocers and butchers for the quality and prices? Or is it because these businesses are often grubby and dim, display things poorly and are inconvenient? I mean, I know that it takes a lot to maintain the sort of standards of displays that supermarkets can easily manage. But if we look at the deli/butcher counters in places like Morrisons, aren't they a world apart from what most local independent shops can offer?

Small businesses need to work on cultivating a professional image which can compete with that of the shops we've become accustomed to using, and capitalize on the services that they can offer that no-one else can. In successful independent butchers, which do still exist and thrive, they have this sort of thing nailed to a great degree. But if the friendly person behind the counter can advise you how long to cook your specific leg of lamb for using the best method, why is that not on a sign in the window? If the greengrocer can explain to you exactly what okra is and how to cook it (supermarket staff are typically as clueless as everyone else), why aren't they advertising it?

It's all about image and appeal. I'm almost in the mind to start a company that franchises out high quality product displays and signage so that independent traders can actually access it and save themselves from themselves. Many or most people are too easily intimidated to try new things. We are habitual and fickle creatures, and being as approachable as is humanly possible is the only way to overcome this.

If you actually look at the wider picture, you'll understand why immigration is fundamental to this whole issue. When you have an influx of unskilled migrants, it weakens the social bond between people in the UK and damages community cohesion. People see this rapid change and think ""Why on earth should I pay housing benefit and tax credits to some Romanian Big Issue seller who's just stepped off the Eurolines coach?"". People start to not care about those at the very bottom and the poor British come off worse. Overall tax receipts start to decline as the social contract between citizen and state diminishes and people don't feel as strong a moral obligation to pay taxes.

There are literally tens of millions of people around the Eurozone with no future and no prospects outside of emigration. If you think it is the British taxpayers duty to feed all these people who want to come here, then fine. But most people would argue it's the duty of the British government to feed the British people first.

&gt;

&gt;The FSA had a priority of making retail markets for financial products and services work more effectively, and so help retail consumers to get a fair deal. Over several years, the FSA developed work to raise levels of confidence and capability among consumers. From 2004, this work was described as a national strategy  on building [financial capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capability) in the UK. This programme was comparable to financial education and literacy strategies in other [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) countries, including the United States.

&gt;In June 2006, the FSA created its Retail Distribution Review (RDR) programme which they maintained would enhance consumer confidence in the retail investment market. The RDR came into force on 31 December 2012. 

&gt;The RDR is expected to have a significant impact on the way in which financial services are delivered to retail investors in the UK.  The primary delivery mechanism of financial services to retail customers is via approximately 30,000 financial intermediaries (FIs) who are authorised and regulated by the FSA. They are expected to bear the brunt of the force of the RDR. The key elements of RDR are:

&gt;


&gt;* Independent advice is truly independent and reflects investors’ needs.

&gt;* People can clearly identify and understand the service they are being offered.

&gt;* Commission-bias is removed from the system and recommendations made by advisers are not influenced by product providers.

&gt;* Investors know up-front how much advice is going to cost and how they will pay for it.

&gt;* All investment advisers will be qualified to a new, higher level, regarded as equivalent to the first year of a degree 

&gt;The combination of these factors is expected to significantly reduce the profitability of many FI practices.  In anticipation of the new regulatory environment being enforced the industry landscape is undergoing significant change. Despite the fact that many in the industry are considered to be poorly prepared for the changes coming into effect,  The most significant identifiable trends are:

&gt;


&gt;* Consolidators buying up small firms of FIs as a result of the higher qualifications threshold and downward pressures on profitability resulting from RDR - E&amp;Y estimate that the number of Registered Individuals will fall from 30,000 to 20,000 within the next 5 years. 

&gt;* IFAs are embracing the concept of [wrap account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrap_account) - incumbent fund supermarkets and Life Assurance Companies are in response launching their own Wrap Platforms. 

&gt;* IFAs are rapidly moving from the traditional investment solution for clients: recommending a portfolio of largely equity-oriented collective investment schemes ([Unit Trusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_trust) and [OEICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-ended_investment_company)) and being paid initial and annual renewal commission by the fund provider to an outsourcing model: recommending that clients appoint a discretionary fund manager to manage the client's portfolio(s) and charging the client an annual oversight fee. A recent survey found that 89% of IFAs are considering outsourcing to discretionary managers as a result of RDR. 

&gt;* Several new entrants are making major in-roads into this market   at the expense of the incumbent retail-oriented funds groups such as [Schroders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroders), [Gartmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartmore), [Fidelity Investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments) etc.  The larger discretionary fund managers are finding it difficult to adapt their business models to cope with these changes, given that the small average portfolio size is better suited  to multi-manager (portfolio of funds) solutions,  via wrap platforms, when these fund managers tend to prefer to retain custody and investing in direct equities.

Chevy does not make a TARDIS...

&gt;I read your post.

&gt;It's either a very dry joke, in which case it gets removed because it's literally just the word ""TARDIS"" stuck onto a car, which doesn't relate to Doctor Who in a way any more meaningful than sticking the word ""TARDIS"" into MS Paint and submitting it on a blank sheet would and gets removed or it's a coincidence, in which case it gets removed.

&gt;Either way, your post was removed for the reasons above. I apologize that this has upset you.

Amen. I'd argue that what works for the rest of the UK isn't working for Scotland.

&gt; I'm just saying it's a huge risk.

Where are you getting your calculations from? Instead of saying ""change is dead scary and risky, let's not bother"", why not identify the risks and mitigate them. Change always involves risk, but sometimes a little bit of risk is necessary to affect change for the better.

&gt;  A well managed large system should have a smaller overhead per person than a smaller system.

If I follow through with that logic, why don't we all just have a single world parliament? It's lovely in theory, but it completely missed the point in why we have countries.

It was absolutely awful politics, it played on the collective ego of the Scottish people and the division it has left behind will likely never heal.

You can see evidence of this in your reply. The fact is this: The whitepaper was already hopelessly optimistic in terms of how much Scotland would receive in oil revenues, and for how long. Oil revenues were to make up about 30% of a future Scottish government budget for many years to come. Since the referendum, oil prices have dropped 30%. So if Scotland had gone independent, the country would now be looking at an immediate ~10% budget deficit by SALMONDS OWN FIGURES. Let alone based on more realistic forecasts. 

The fact is this: Scotland isn't even CLOSE to paying its way if you exclude the oil revenues. In fact, with the recent downturn on oil revenues, it's not even close to paying its way if you INCLUDE all the oil either!

&gt;**Why should rich people get the same support as the poor?**

&gt;
Different levels of welfare support create administrative difficulties such as deciding who is poor, choosing an appropriate threshold and monitoring individual's changing financial circumstances. The existing means-tested system in the administration of welfare and benefits schemes is expensive, inefficient and often causes delays in payment. On top of that, it creates a stigma against those who are in need of welfare benefits. This selective system also disproportionately benefits the poor and creates a disincentive to work.

I'm saying that there is not much difference in administration between a basic income that cuts or fades out 50% tax bracket earners and one that is universal, so long as it is structured correctly under the taxation system, so the whole argument about rich people getting an income that they don't need shouldn't be necessary.

In any case, the only thing we're really eliminating is unemployment benefits and Jobseeker's Allowance, for which the administrative savings are obvious. Most other benefits and the means-testing associated with them (Atos or otherwise) would not be fundamentally changed by basic income, though the amounts would have to take it into account. For example, if students gained a basic income and lost their council tax exemption, that would probably be a net loss for them.

Jobcentres would also hopefully still exist, but they'll be re-purposed back into their original mission of helping people find work instead of a place for benefits and interrogating the jobless on how hard they are looking for work.",0,1418062073,null,0,false,0,cmow8s1,t3_2omxl6,t1_cmow8s1,t1_cmoubz4,null,1425539885,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;AG's Ref No.2 of 1989 (Major) (1989) 11 Cr.App.R.(S) 481
In cases where the robbery occurs in smaller shops (such as a betting shop) which don't have the sophisticated protection that banks and building societies may have, the court must offer its protection and impose a deterrent custodial sentence. The appropriate starting point is 7 years' imprisonment


&gt;AG's Ref. No.7 of 1992 (Khan) (1993) 14 Cr.App.R.(S) 122
Small shops are often staffed by only one person who may be unable to defend him/herself. It is also unlikely there will be any sophisticated security, and it is a prime target for someone who wants to enrich himself quickly and successfully. 
It is therefore appropriate to pass deterrent sentences in cases of robbery of small shops, small corner/grocer shops and to sub-Post Offices. Original sentence of 3 years quashed and replaced with 7 years' imprisonment, on a plea of guilty.

Even then, he's not benched, but being forced to face reality as far as his age and stamina goes.  He's still going to be starting a lot.

I'm thinking more of how he chucked Lucas, Sakho, Agger, and for a little while Skrtel, to the bench last season.  He took some extra time with Lovren because he seems to hate Sakho more than anyone else right now and Lovren was his new boy on the block, so he was always going to get an extended chance to prove himself immediately.  Rodgers is not afraid to put a player other than Gerrard on the bench if they play poorly.

They'll be expensive, absolutely.  I'm mostly agreeing with you that I don't know if we have that kind of money to spend.  If we do though, I really believe that our single greatest use of it is on one player, a striker who can play with Sturridge when he's fit, and then pick up the slack in a big way when Sturridge is out.  I think this is much more important than a CB, especially if we're going to be playing with a real defensive midfielder now.  

Our defenders were getting lynched by our midfield because we had 0 protection for them.  Lucas back in the side is making an absolutely massive difference.  I think our CBs are quality, but we've been asking them to do WAY too much on their own iwth no cover in front of them.  We can solve that well enough until summer by sticking with a real defensive option to anchor the midfield.

I also think a keeper is more important than another CB.  Ilori should get a chance with us and he's looked good on his loans so far.  Mignolet doesn't lead from the back, doesn't organize anything including himself for set pieces, is awful at controlling his area, and not the best technically/with the ball at his feet.

No, we didn't ""lap this shit up"" any more than 55% ""lapped up the UK gov's shit"". Most of us listened to both sides and made a reasoned decision, we're not thick. Scotland is as viable a country as any other, I am yet to be convinced that Scotland would be so unique in Europe and the world that it would fail, while all countries around it flourish. It's a bizarre suggestion. How does any country pay for itself? Why would Scotland be any different? Are you under some illusion that Scotland doesn't currently pay for itself or something? Is there something special about Scotland that makes it less likely to survive than Denmark, or New Zealand, or Ireland, or Finland? Well, what is it that's so incredulous about the idea of Scottish independence?

&gt; It was absolutely awful politics

Scotland has a different political climate to the rest of the UK. It only makes sense that it's governed as a separate country.

&gt; The whitepaper was already hopelessly optimistic

The white paper was the SNP's manifesto for an independent Scotland, but the SNP are not the only party in Scotland and they are not the only party in favour of independence. I'm a Green voter, and Patrick Harvie (co-covener of the Scottish Green party and my Green MSP for Glasgow) did more to convince me to vote Yes than Alex Salmond or the white paper. This isn't about the SNP or Alex Salmond, and the rest of the UK was led to believe it was. It's a very simplified version of a complex issue.

You can scream and shout about the volatility of oil all you like, but I'll never be convinced that Scotland is so unique in the world that it cannot afford to pay its way without oil. It's a bonus to our economy, not the basis. Your argument seems to be ""Scotland can't afford to be independent"", not ""Scotland shouldn't be independent"". They don't mean the same thing. I'd ask you, if Scotland could afford it, do you think it *should* be independent? If you don't even think it should be, then there's not point arguing that it *can't* be.

TL;DR - I am not convinced that Scotland can't be independent (financially or otherwise). On top of that, I am convinced that it should be independent (politically and idealogically). It therefore makes sense to me to support Scottish independence.",0,1418063428,null,0,false,0,cmowzwd,t3_2on1v0,t1_cmowzwd,t1_cmow33c,null,1425539535,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Another issue with this may be that Downing won't have as free of a role. His role on the tip of a diamond allows him to go out left to put in crosses if he wants. That space may now be filled with Valencia that isn't as good there. 

Also, all 3 of the forwards are out and out strikers. They all want to be in the box and aren't as good out wide. That may result in a rather narrow strike force OR mediocre wing play from Sakho and Valencia as they're not wingers.

This, theoretically, would give me enough meals for about three or four weeks until some money came through. Two or three bowls of pasta a day. I just had to hold my nose and get through it. Drink as much water as I could swallow to spread it out. No place for pride at the bottom.

Seven days in and I had begun to retch whenever I took a bite of it. I had eaten the same meal twenty times in a row and all I could taste was inedible starch. I became paler and paler, fatter and fatter, my eyes began to sink. I quickly lost all physical energy, could barely rouse myself to do chores or leave the house, and the lack of minerals and vitamins took a toll on my brain. I was slow on the uptake, stumbling in my speech, and kept saying stupid things or making category errors in my thoughts. Ended up having to trick my body into eating it without throwing up: frying the pasta, pinching my nose while swallowing, or 'downing' as much as I could in one shot to get it in. It still came back up every now and then, no matter what I did.

After a few long, long weeks I was rescued; someone kind gave me some spare food, and then eventually I managed to pay off some bills and could afford a little more real food, and after far too much time I got a job and was able to rejoin society and eat like a human being again.

However, the value of the degree isn't in the job you get straight after uni, it's the job you get 3-4 years down the line.

I mean I'm 3-4 years since I left uni and now I work as an auditor earning a pretty good wage living in London. If I hadn't got my degree I can guarantee I wouldn't have got this job. You don't need a degree to get a job in the 20K-30K range, but if you really want career progression you need qualifications. Especially in London for  some jobs unless you have a degree minimum plus professional qualifications (e.g. Accountancy, Law, Project Management etc) or you have an MBA you're going to struggle.

I mean I always compare myself to a friend I've had since High School. She's no less intelligent than me, she works twice as hard as me but I earn almost twice as much.

No business rates or shop rentals (apart from storage or warehouse space) involved for the e-tailers. All this translates to much lower prices and a more competitive overall market for UK goods, putting the high street at a major cost disadvantage. 

This can be addressed by giving them a break. Perhaps councils could stop bending them over the table and pounding them repeatedly in the ass. That might help. 

People still like to touch and feel the products they're buying, to try things on, pop over to the corner shop for some milk, to sit at a nice cafe, or have a day out shopping. Those are the advantages the high street will always have over purchasing goods online. 

But unless they can offer these things at competitive prices, they will promptly be put out of the price range of most consumers, who at this point are used to 'finding it cheaper online'. 

For food and bev, I agree with another poster on here that many places are just uninviting and dirty. Standards are so low for some of these places, they shouldn't be allowed on the high street in the first place. 

There's a '5 star' hygiene sticker on the door of a Chinese near me. They're filthy and the food is really nasty. I looked them up on the government inspection website, and they actually got 1 star on their most recent inspection. Places like this should simply be shut down immediately, to be replaced by *nice*, *clean*, *fresh*, *inviting* places, who get a fair deal on their business rates so they can afford be.

Now thats out the way I would choose a particular role to practice, and even more so stick to a limited hero pool within that role (say 5 with each hero having a unique play style to the other i.e Puck is initiator mid where as Naga can play a farming mid). Focusing on a specific role and limited hero pool will hone yours skills greatly rather than picking randomly. Personally to increase MMR play the mid role or another core role (this is if you want quicker results). You should slowly start to increase MMR once you PRACTICE them heroes &amp; PLAY MORE with an objective in mind (also watch recent games of pros on the heroes you've chosen). Once you feel stronger in that role and have mastered them 5 heroes you can slowly widen your hero pool. My last advice is too aproach every game with a clear and calm mind, like Poker (personal life problems can effect how you play in my opinion). Believe that every game is winnable, dont rage at team mates and have fun. Thats pritty much it.

It actually emphasises that the whole island of Ireland must give consent. [Relevant paragraph (1.ii)](http://peacemaker.un.org/uk-ireland-good-friday98):

&gt; (The governments) recognise that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland;

So, majority support in NI is an explicit requirement, but the Republic must also give concurrent support to the reunification (the wording is ambiguous as to if this must be through a referendum with majority support, or if a parliamentary motion or similar would be sufficient).

Ignoring rent (because you say housing benefit is kept intact, which I think messes up the sums, but whatever) I reckon you'd spend a bare minimum of £20/ week shopping for food, £15.50 / week on sundry bills like gas and electricity, £10 / week on a bus pass, maybe £4.50 / week on a cheap phone contract (which gives you access to the Internet, which is the important bit) and you have the grand total of £312 to buy all of your clothes, entertainment, appliances and furniture for a year.

But wouldn't there be a threshold where people would rather choose the BI only than a low-paid job to top up BI for some extra cash? While you mentioned that there would always be some people who would decide to keep the job, but I imagine the temptation to aim for something better and leave McDonald's would make it more difficult for the company to recruit more staff (even if, yes, there would be some people who would take it and would be happy with it, just perhaps not enough). 

I believe that McDonald's wouldn't go under, but would have to change its employment conditions and/or pay in order to keep all of its restaurants going with enough staff. Even if they 'only' lose 5-10% of workers to BI, that would impact the infrastructure which currently keeps their costs low, and I wonder if their employment problems would persist unless they raised wages and conditions. 

I think you're right that many or most people would stay on, but I can see a difficulty for many companies paying low wages to keep their business model afloat. I don't agree with those who say most people wouldn't work, but I do think they would be more selective about where they work. 

Something which goes against my point is the introduction of the minimum wage, which many people said would ruin businesses and would lead to loads of people being fired, but instead simply led to better payment for workers.

It's not that Scotland would ""fail"" not ""not survive"". It isn't going to turn into Somalia. The government would simply have considerably less money to spend than currently, which would mean huge cuts to Schools, Police, the NHS etc. *Far worse cuts than the cuts currently going on UK-wide, the ones which lead you to say ""And people wonder why so many of us voted Yes in September.""*. 

&gt;Scotland has a different political climate to the rest of the UK. It only makes sense that it's governed as a separate country.

No more than any other area of the UK. Wales or the north of England both vote heavily for parties of the left too.

&gt;You can scream and shout about the volatility of oil all you like, but I'll never be convinced that Scotland is so unique in the world that it cannot afford to pay its way without oil. It's a bonus to our economy, not the basis. 

You can pretend like the oil doesn't exist if you like, but it WOULD have made up a huge part of your economy. Without it completely, government tax revenue in an independent Scotland would be down about 30%. Now it doesn't matter if you're an SNP supporter or Green... You can't fund wind turbines nor keep free NHS/University/Prescriptions etc etc etc without money. 

So given that we have now firmly established that an independent Scotland would be much worse off that currently, what makes you continue to believe that the Green Party of an independent Scotland would ride in post-independence and turn Scotland into some sort of paradise of ""fairness"", despite having far less money available to do it with?

It's not for me to say on whether Scotland should be independent. I would like to have seen it happen, because I'm a massive arsehole and despite it fucking up lots of lives it would have been hilarious for me personally!

My beef is with the widespread belief in Scotland that *if only you could gain independence*, you'd create an incredible paradise of equality and happiness.

People go on about how ""he's too good for us"" and ""he's the France captain, he should be playing in the CL"" and ""surely he knows that he could walk into almost team in the world"" ... but most or all of that was true in 2012, and he came *here*.

I don't think Hugo Lloris thinks the way other players think, or how we assume most career-calculating players think.  He seems to have a different mentality (on and off the pitch) and different set of values.  From the way he conducts himself, to the things he/his wife have said in the media, to the way he stayed at Lyon long after his star had outgrown the club ... he seems to favor stability more than some other players, and he seems to enjoy a project.

If the club is making progress, and Pochettino continues to get the strong backing of the board, I don't see Hugo leaving, regardless of the team that comes calling.  I have this fantasie that in June when the transfer rumours are swirling, Marine Lloris will put out a tweet saying: ""We are very happy in London.  Hugo loves Tottenham and is not interested in offers from other clubs.""

By the same token, if Pochettino gets sacked at the end of the season or before, Lloris will see a 4th manager in 2 years and probably decide that enough is enough.

false,alister667,lfc68,,"I have a lot of time for AFC Wimbledon. 

I remember the FA Cup final when the old Wimbledon beat us in 1988. We were red hot favourites and it was a huge upset, even though Wimbledon were a top flight side at the time. They were tough and uncompromising often advocates of long ball theory. I remember feeling numb as the final whistle went. It was terrible. 

However, what happened to the fans of Wimbledon afterwards was worse. They were taken over by some Icelandic investors who decided in 2001 to move the club to Milton Keynes, 50 miles to the north of their traditional London home. This was despite the vehement opposition of the vast majority of fans who saw their beloved club taken away from them.

There were campaigns, legal challenges, but ultimately the owners of the club won and moved their club to Milton Keynes. They became the MK Dons.

The fans of Wimbledon didn't  take it lying down, they went and formed AFC Wimbledon in 2002. Forming a new club meant they had to start at the bottom rung of the English Leagues, The Combined  Counties league - the 9th Tier of English football. In the next 12 seasons they've made their way up through the Combined Counties league the Isthmian Leagues and the Football Conferences. MK Dons were religated and had a period of financial trouble, but they survived as well, although there is a lot of animosity between the two clubs.   

They even met in last years (might have been 2012?) FA Cup where the MK Dons (unfortunately from my point of view) won. 

I've a soft spot for AFC Wimbledon as their fans were totally shafted out of a decade of League football, but they've kept going and although they're not as large a club as they once were they're still based in London and I believe they have plans to move back into their orginal ground at Plough Lane. I hope they make a shed load of money from Liverpool visiting, and it brings their dream of getting their club back to the way it was before it was taken from them, a little closer.

Having said that, I hope we stuff them, of course.

Entirely dependant on location. I've just submitted a scheme to planning where I exceeded a maximum density and had to remove over 20% of the planned units.

&gt; infrastructure restrictions (particularly parking to discourage car users as mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

Again it varies by location. Some local authorities actually have minimum parking standards not maximum. Norfolk for example. But generally yes, from a developer standpoint less parking requirements means more units.

&gt; green development legislation

Not entirely sure which part to reference here.

&gt; Most people would like larger rooms, more outdoor space, sufficient storage inside the property (as well as outside for that matter), space to park more than one car, walls you can't hear the neighbours breath through, etc.

Car parking excepted, none of these are planning issues. They're entirely developer led which, given the profit margin issue which you mentioned, is exactly why they won't improve. Or if they are improved, a buyer will just have the cost passed to them.

A real anoyance from my perspective as a designer AND buyer is that affordable housing has HIGHER standards for space requirements than general market housing.

No. The remit of TPS lies strictly within the boundaries of live unsolicited calls of a sales/marketing nature. 

&gt;It does not stop other call types such as recorded/automated messages, silent calls, market research, overseas companies, debt collection, scam calls, nuisance and abusive calls etc. 

It's funny - I get no calls from charities or market research, but loads from companies wanting to sell stuff.

I was invalidating your argument by giving an example of a slow player who is far from useless.

People often seem to think we should build the team around Lamela over Eriksen which is insane and I have to assume it is because of the prices paid for each. Eriksen is one of if not the most highly regarded young 10s in the world.

Aha, that makes more sense then. Unfortunately, life often doesn't like to give us questions with simple answers. I think the tax system that accompanies BI would be a pretty crucial detail, not only because of the question of administration, but because it's the thing that will have to pay for the BI in the first place, and that might be difficult if we're decreasing what the highest earners pay to 30%.

I'm not convinced a flat tax with BI is the best way forward, it seems like something that would be seen as another example of squeezing the middle classes instead of fair redistribution of wealth. Personally, I don't think we have to abandon progressive taxation at all to make it work, and neither do we have to keep it strictly universal. The whole administrative thing isn't a vital argument.

All FA registered teams have the chance to enter into the first prelim qualifying round, as long as they meet certain requirements (for example having floodlighting). There are 6 qualifiers, then 8 rounds of the competition proper.

Off the top of my head:

Tier 9 and below start in the first qualifier round (I think it is called prelim qualification), then Tier 8 in second (called pre-qualification IIRC). 

Then Tier 6-7 in the first qualifying round (actually the third round, but for some reason the FA like to call this the first round...). By round 6 of the qualification, all conference sides (the first level of the real 'pro' teams) have entered and the winners go onto the actual FA Cup First Round. 

The First Round Proper (as it is knows) involves League 1 and 2 in addition to the qualification winners. 

The Second round includes The Championship sides.

The Third Round includes EPL teams.

This means that, in theory a side of amateurs could end up playing Everton if they do well enough... Shildon for example got into the first round 10 years or so back and Havent and Waterlooville [achieved this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7197712.stm) in 08.

BNP voters were and are a cross section of two major dying consituencies - the white working class and the Powellian old guard tories.

These two constituencies briefly intersected in a larger than usual racist BNP vote in 2010 as both their parties of choice had disowned them, and then went on to form the troublesome lower sections of UKIP, by and large. A few of the cleverer ones will have faked repentance and gone back to the LibLabCon fold.

I'm actually surprised the Guardian keeps going on about the bankrupt racists, I thought they'd copy-pasted all their fifth column hyperbole bollocks about the BNP onto the EDL, or UKIP or whoever they think are standing in the way of  their increasingly thin and shrill vision of the great society.

Most sci-fi is about observing society from an abstract. There is nothing particularly hard-coded into the show that stops them from going there, and perhaps, just perhaps, the show might actually be able to express something pertinent about gender. If anything, co-opting the gender discussion adds directly to the plot, the character, and it's value, establishing lore, developing characters, and creating a well of thematic topics for that Doctor to persevere through.

Of course it would be a social statement. Star Trek is a social statement. Jurassic Park is a social statement. Doctor Who is laden with them, and has the opportunity to make a statement to an audience filled with people trying to understand their gender, portraying them as the titular hero. 

What is your point? Does it basically boil down to; ""I am against this because I am scared they will do a bad job""?

I agree with 'character first' writing, but there is no straight line to achieving that end, and honestly, this is a fifty year old character. A lot of the really good shit has been written three times over now. The character development that a female casting would bring is as huge as the development which an old Doctor brings in contrast to the younger ones, and the younger ones in contrast to the original older ones.

**Price of product:** £12.50 for 50ml tube  
**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:**
&gt; Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream Night 5% Urea is an intensive overnight face cream for dry to very dry and tight skin. Enriched with Urea and Lactate, two naturally occurring compounds that bind in moisture,  skin is instantly hydrated and the the feeling of tightness is reduced.  
Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream Night 5% Urea also smooths the skin through the action of Urea.

&gt; CLINICAL STUDIES   
Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream Night 5% Urea was tested by 30 female patients with  dry facial skin. Each patient’s facial skin condition was assessed by a physician  after 2 weeks of treatment.Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream Night 5% Urea was tested by 32 people with dry skin, moisturisation, roughness and skin barrier function were the main focus areas.

&gt; MAIN FINDINGS  
Significant improvements in facial *dryness* and facial *firmness*.
The appearance of dry skin drastically improved. (*facial redness (erythema), facial scaling, fine lines and wrinkles on the face, facial itching*)  
The majority of patients described the cream’s *tolerability as “good” or “very good”*  
Skin's *moisture levels increased* within 1 week.
Moisture levels gradually decreased when the product was not applied.  
Skin *roughness reduced* within 1 week.  
Significantly *improved skin barrier function*, as measured by a decrease in transepidermal water loss, compared to untreated skin, in-vivo test

**Your opinion:** Incredibly hydrating. I was suffering from extreme dry patches/eczema under my eyes and around my mouth and these sorted them out in two days. I use it both in the day and at night, but it can leave a sheen/slightly greasy look. nothing a little powder doesn't fix. It's simple, no frills but prevents scaly grey patches even when I'm heavy handed with my exfoliation/retinoid. Thankfully it didn't cause any clogging even where I can be prone to it.

false,bcash,null,null,"&gt; eliminate poverty (except in cases of very bad decision makers)

The amounts of money quoted in the article are £71 per week, which isn't going to lift anyone out of poverty.  This amount is apparently affordable, implying that a larger basic income that would be enough to live cannot be funded.

Most of the basic income proposals in other parts of the world set the basic income at the level of the current median wage.

&gt; kick start the economy. More money at the low end of income (where people spend what they've got) is more money circulating. Too much money at the top lies stagnant in bonds or worse gets moved offshore.

This isn't how economics works.

""Money in bonds"" isn't stagnant.  Money in bonds isn't money at all, it's a bond, the money that was used to purchase the bond has been spent on something.  In the case of government bonds it'll be buying a new aircraft carrier or an expensive new railway line, or buying champagne for the House of Lords (but the champagne merchants are part of the economy too).  True, this expenditure is invisible to most people, it's not money spent in the high street, but it does put a lot of money into a lot of industries that employ *a lot* of people.

Also money doesn't get moved offshore either.  If a rich UK person invests in something abroad using US dollars they buy US dollars with their £ sterling; in order to do that, there will be someone willing to make the opposite trade, i.e. a non-UK resident wishing to invest in the UK or buy a product from a UK company.  As with anything else, the price of such a transaction is set by supply-and-demand; if there were significant capital outflow there wouldn't be less money, rather we'd have the same money, it would just reduce in value (i.e. inflation).  And while there's always the threat of inflation, there's no more of it at the moment than average.

The real unanswered question with the proposal of basic income is the effect it would have on wage inflation.  If people got £25,000 for doing nothing, no-one would clean toilets for the minimum wage.  ""That's the point!"" I hear you cry, and I agree, but when the average hotel costs £1,000 a night because their entire service staff are on £150,000 a year it's going to have a negative effect felt widely throughout the entire economy.",0,1418072624,null,0,false,0,cmp28gx,t3_2omxl6,t1_cmp28gx,t1_cmou0ra,null,1425537064,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

MSc, as we call it.

&gt; Specifically, which ones are in urban areas which offer degrees in the above courses of study that have programs to admit overseas students?

I think you can figure out which universities are in urban areas by yourself. You have obviously done no research at all, as you would realise that *almost* no universities exist in primarily rural areas.

All universities admit people with foreign qualifications as a matter of course. You will wish to apply as a domestic student for reasons that will become apparent when you start doing your own research.

&gt; What steps do I have to take to apply to schools in the UK?

First of all, look at their websites. There is no standardised process for graduate degrees, and will also depend on whether you would like to persuade the government to pay for your studies.

&gt; What are the requirements that most graduate programs have?

Like the US, universities are free to set their admissions criteria independently.

&gt; Is there any other general advice you have for someone who has little to no knowledge about studying abroad?

Do some research before asking badly formed questions.

They just addressed that with last year's Christmas episode. The Time Lords gave the Doctor more regenerations.

The Master wasn't evil because he found ways around the 12 regeneration limit. The Master was evil because he valued his own continued existence above all else.

&gt;You have obviously done no research at all

I actually have. I saw a few universities that were pretty out of the way, and in an area I'd consider ""rural."" I looked into a few in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and Leeds, but didn't really find many that were offering my particular major. It seemed really inefficient, so I figured I'd ask people who probably know more about the system than I.

&gt;You will wish to apply as a domestic student for reasons that will become apparent when you start doing your own research.

What's the difference between a domestic student who is from overseas and an international student? I don't think we have such a distinction here.

&gt;There is no standardised process for graduate degrees

What I was looking for was something like this, which another Redditor pointed me to: http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/international/how-apply

&gt;Like the US, universities are free to set their admissions criteria independently.

I'm not asking about specific numbers-based requirements, just general ones. For example, if you were to ask the same question regarding US schools, I'd mention that you'd probably need at least one letter of recommendation from a professor and a statement of purpose, as well as taking the GRE and possibly having a minimum GPA. I'm not looking for specific benchmarks I need to reach, but just items I need to gather, tests I need to take, etc.

&gt;Do some research before asking badly formed questions.

Compare sexual preference in humans (Not quite the same thing but consider it anyway). A majority seem to be on or near the ""default"" which is heterosexuality, but there is a whole spectrum of other sexualities. We know this. As a society we're coming to accept that about ourselves.

We also have gender fluidity of course. Lots of people feel they're in the wrong body and take steps to switch. However, at least for humans, those of us lucky enough to be born as one of the ""default"" genders tend to stick with that gender throughout our lives. Call it monogenderism for the want of a better word.

A similar deal seems to apply on Gallifrey. A monogendered individual would tend to stick with their birth gender.

Up to press, the Doctor seems to be one of these individuals. For over 1000 years and 14 regenerations, he's stuck to being male.

The Master, too seems to have been this way until recently.

This is not to say that preferences can't change over time in Gallifreyan biology. A regeneration left largely to chance (much as the Doctor has tended to leave his hair colour to chance) can result in a new incarnation with entirely new preferences.

Here's a hypothetical individual to think about:

Incarnation X is monogendered as is the genetically predisposed default, and regenerates into incarnation X+1 which includes a randomised genetic marker which overrides the predisposed monogenderism.

Incarnation X+1 then deliberately chooses to be the opposite gender (or maybe something we'd consider in-between) for the next incarnation.

Incarnation X+2 then has a new gender... but may not include the randomising marker, giving this incarnation a higher likelihood of returning to the birth gender as incarnation X+3.

This doesn't rule out anything that Steven Moffat has said, of course. All we need say is that the average Gallifreyan is more gender fluid than the average human being, but that like us, there's a whole spectrum of predisposition / preference.

I bet the Doctor is aware of individuals who alternated male and female from incarnation to incarnation throughout their lives.

They're just unrealistic and idealistic. Their ideas sound great, but they would be unlikely to deliver anything of value, particular as they come across very anti-growth e.g. few would disagree that taxing the rich and corporations is a bad idea (there are loads of taxes that apply to them), but the Greens take it to an extreme that would impede growth. They seem to ignore that the rich and large companies provide jobs, capital for investment in loads of things, and support infrastructure too i.e. increasing taxation is not the only (or necessarily the best) way to go about it, especially if you're doing it in a way that the rich will perceive as a penalty -- they'll just take chunks of their assets elsewhere and it will engender resentment.

Ironically this creates opposite sort of sentiment the Greens like to portray of everyone being equal; everyone but the rich corporate parasites. All taxation does is force the money to pass through more hands, typically lowering efficiency with some of it getting 'lost' along the way though this isn't to say redistribution of wealth is bad, just that tax isn't always best. 

To be honest, if you speak to any politician or member of the public, no one will tell you that any of them is currently doing a good job; they will only tell you that their party can do it better, regardless of whether what they want to do is actually sensible. The Greens are especially like this: their stance is pretty much that whatever anyone is doing, or has been doing, they will do the opposite because everything is currently rubbish as a result of their views being a minority.",0,1418075392,null,0,1418247446,0,cmp3tyz,t3_2kduub,t1_cmp3tyz,t3_2kduub,null,1425536320,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

false,jamiroq,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Do people choose supermarkets over local greengrocers and butchers for the quality and prices?

Usually its just convenience, having everything in one place rather than several.
I always go to my Butcher for meat, the quality is noticeably better than super markets and even online places that deliver. His business isn't struggling either, on the weekend its always packed. The price is even negligible compared to supermarkets so it doesn't really make sense for me not to go there. And, like you say, the staff are always friendly and offer advice.

When it comes to online shopping, there are certain items that are mostly going to be better to buy in a shop, clothes being the best example - each brand has their own fit and unless you try it on there's no guarantees you will like it. The only items of clothing I can get away with online are probably T shirts and hoodies, everything else I need to try on.

But the fact is, its more convieniant to order online, you don't have to make the trip to town and pay parking, and you don't have to search through different shops if you cant find exactly what you're looking for. Add to the fact that the cost is sometimes cheaper online as well.

I don't know what Mane is doing in training but he's a liability in games and shouldn't be starting. I can forgive him for losing the ball now and again when he takes a man on, we need a guy like that. But its the constant misplaced passing in attack that's killing us. No excuse for it. 

That much said. There are still positives to take.

Pelle scored, and it did him the world of good. Made better runs and seemed more confident shooting.

Tadic seemed more himself again. He's been a bit absent last couple of games but he was better tonight.

Most importantly, we actually made some clear cut chances tonight. It felt like we hadn't made one in the last 3 matches. We were playing balls in behind and one or two crosses were dangerous. Villa we were bad, but we've gotten better with each match since. Still not as good as we can be, the breakaways in particular ran out of steam pretty quickly but it was better.

Train from there to Witton Station (it's about 10 minutes closer to the ground than Aston Station). Have google maps on your phone, just in case you get lost if you're well ahead of the crowds, but it's not hard to find (pretty sure it's signed from the station). 

Yeah, tickets through the club's site will be fine. 

As for where to sit, what would you most like to experience? Best view of the game, or best experience of the club?

For the best view you want lower tier of either the Doug Ellis Stand or the Trinity Road stand close-ish to half-way. If you want a bit of a sing-song, a bit (lot) of banter and (in my experience) the most passionate fans then you want the middle of the Upper Tier of the Holte End.

""Why don’t you close down the premises with a low rating?

Officers can only close a business if it represents an imminent risk to health. Some zero rating premises may have fallen into this category, but local authorities will usually give the owner a chance to put things right and this may involve the service of legal notices. Sometimes caterers will close voluntarily for a short period of time whilst any remedial work is going ahead, but consumers would not necessarily be aware of the local authority’s intervention.""

So yea, apparently that kiosk you saw might pose an imminent risk to your health, however the owner was being given 'another chance' to peddle whatever awful shit they had on offer for a bit longer.

That's an even worse idea. 

Company's and people would just avoid tax even more than they do now, fuel a black market in highly taxed goods. Outsourcing of businesses and a loss of tax revenue over all. Maybe in another 50 years when the vast majority of jobs are automated but we aren't there yet.

Definitely wouldn't have started at the level I did without the work I did outside of uni throughout the three year course. That included two self-sought internships and various bits of freelance work.

For all the effort I put into acquiring skills and knowledge a lot of it sat untapped in my first year in industry as I struggled with the social side of things. I was very confrontational in how I worked with people (and still considered so really) which often slowed things down. Also struggled to understand the intricacies of the business and the internal politics which often made it hard to get a desired outcome.

On the flip side, really knowing my stuff allowed me to be confrontational, cut through a lot of crap, and shatter some long held opinions about my discipline within the company. 

Overall I'd say knowing how to convince people and talk around a point to come to a mutual understanding is just as important when it comes to getting someone to make a decision in your favour, and is a skill that can be acquired through practice like any other.

I'd say university provides a very safe (judge free) environment to do both. I got the job through two friends who were in the company.

* Don't rule out universities in smaller locations, I suspect your definition of 'rural' is somewhat different to ours. Universities in smaller cities and towns can be very good for getting your bearings straight away and getting to know people, and most will still be within easy reach of a train station. (St Andrews is the exception to that which springs to mind!) Give us a couple of examples of places you've considered 'too rural'? :)

* Universities love applicants from overseas....it's all about the money! Irrespective of citizenship, you'll be paying international fees. However, if you are recognised as a British citizenship, that'll avoid the cost and hassle of visas, make it slightly easier here when dealing with banks etc., and also gives you the permanent right to settle anywhere in the EU.

* Our universities work rather more informally than American ones tend to, as far as communication between students and academic staff. Undergraduates generally address staff by first names, for instance, none of that 'Professor X' nonsense. As you find particular places which are of interest, feel free to email the staff most relevant to your area of study, just to open an informal line of communication. They'll be able to give you a better idea of their expectations of prospective postgraduate students with respect to your individual situation.

* References are going to be important. Talk to staff at your current university to sound them out about this, rather than springing it on them out of the blue. They might also have their own advice, including particular individuals they'd recommend studying with (or not).",0,1418078030,null,0,false,0,cmp5afr,t3_2oobu0,t1_cmp5afr,t3_2oobu0,null,1425535568,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Yes I have, and my statement stands.

&gt; Fry claimed that it was composition of the stone dust that makes it smell which is a completely wrong explanation

No it isn't. The stone dust smelled of gunpowder, no matter the deeper explanation. It's simplified. It works. It was a short snippet. He didn't have time for your wall of text. 

&gt;  The dust smells for 20 minutes and then loses all smell after coming into contact with air for the first time in its existence. It wouldn't do that if its composition was the real reason because in that case it would never stop to smell. The real reason is an electrical charge on the surface of the dust particles that comes from solar wind and gets registered by human olfactory sensors and goes away after 20 minutes of contact with air.

This would have sent everyone to bloody sleep. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if they did have the deeper explanation then it was cut for time / lack of entertainment value.

There are certainly right-wing individuals within Plaid, but they are certainly a minority, and, I would argue, not a particularly significant one. That is definitely what voting patterns in elections and at conference seems to suggest - after all, we did just elect a dyed-in-the-wool socialist and republican as our leader a couple of years ago.

Plaid is among the most left-wing parties in Britain. Out of those which stand a chance of getting seats in national elections, I would say they are only exceeded in their socialist tendencies by the Greens. They are certainly to the left of the SNP (though the SNP are also being steered further to the left by their new leader).

Besides, I very much doubt that any of those ""small-c conservatives"" would ever defect to UKIP out of any sort of ideological struggle: UKIP is as close as it gets to the antithesis of Welsh nationalism, be it left-wing or right-wing. A defection to the Conservatives, on the other hand, would be more understandable; after all, the Tories support the principle of devolution and are keen to see further powers devolved in future.",0,1418078993,null,0,false,0,cmp5stb,t3_2ojqrp,t1_cmp5stb,t1_cmovtr0,null,1425535330,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2

&amp;gt; I'm female. I don't want my Doctor to be. I'm open minded about all kinds of things. I agree that representation in the media is important and I think it's cool if Gallifreyans are gender fluid. I think humans could be a lot more gender fluid if we weren't so hung up on titles and roles and checking little boxes. But I want my Doctor to be male. Is that sexist of me? Maybe. Perhaps it stems from feeling safe and protected by the Doctor as a male. I'm not really sure. But I think changing the overall 'face' of the show would be strange, at least this far in, and unnecessary. I'm fine with a female Time Lord but I don't want it to be the Doctor.

I'm willing to admit that my view is sexist but it's not about who can act. It is the feeling evoked by the show in its current and past state and how I relate to it, I suppose. If this was a brand new show, I would be all for a brainy, sassy female lead. But to kinda sorta reinvent the show just doesn't make sense to me. I bet I would wind up liking a female Doctor but the show would feel very different to me. Obviously the different regenerations have their own flavor and style and appeal but they're still in the framework of being this masculine figure and I don't want to see that go. Sexist, I guess, but that's my story. 

I don't see too many female Santa Claus figures this time of year, or female representations of Jesus, or hell, Robin Hood. Even though you CAN do that to a legend, isn't it better to create new legends instead of changing the old ones to suit a whim?

false,[deleted],null,null,"As a kinky person who takes naughty photos and publishes them on the internet, the porn laws are a layer cake of fail.

Do they protect children? No. Children when they find porn do not use DVDs or VoD services, they use free sites that are unregulated by this.

Do they protect Pornstars? No. The people publishing VoD movies aren't slimy, backroom micro businesses, they're largely professional, practice safe sex, abide by the law and already care for their performers. They use safe words and signs if things go wrong anyway because they don't want to be the porn studio marked as being one where someone died, even accidently. The ones who don't do this won't bother following these laws anyway.

Will it protect women, or indeed anyone: No, there doesn't seem to be that much link between sexual violence and porn anyway.

So what does it do? Well it targets acts in porn and harms pornographers, usually the small time producers (so much for promoting British small businesses). It also as many people seem to point out, targets femdom in particular. Lets go through them in general.

* Watersports: Watersports my disgust some people, but it doesn't harm anyone. If the person you are pissing on consents to it and the person doing the pissing consents to it, there should be no problem.

* Squirting: Squirting is troubling because if a woman genuinely squirts she is having an intense orgasm and is gaining pleasure from it. Is this really something we should be banning? Surely we should be promoting genuine, intense orgasms in porn.

* Spanking: Spanking is pretty much vanilla. How's this banned? Seriously, who hasn't playfully spanked people during foreplay or copulation?

* Caning: OK, painful, but not harmful unless you're doing something OTT.

* Aggressive whipping: This is rather vague, you'll see a lot of this in this list. Define aggressive. All whipping is aggressive, what makes it whipping not aggressive?

* Penetration by any object ""associated with violence"": Again, another vague one. It'll cover things like guns and police batons but what about rubber fists? Hell, a penis can be associated with violence, are we going to ban human like dildos and penises too? Let me tell you a story. There's a sex shop in town that sold the most amazing double ended dildo in the world. I never bought it, but I called in Nigel. It was a rubber double ended black dildo which was a thick as my forearm and about as long too. I often joked that if there was a Zombie Apocalypse I would go to that sex shop, acquire it and use it as a melee weapon. Does that make it associated with violence?

* Physical or verbal abuse (regardless of  if consensual): Surely that would cover spanking, caning and whipping? But I digress, how much porn have you seen where the woman or the man says ""FUCK ME YOU FUCKING FUCKER"" or words to that effect? Is that going to be banned?

* Role-playing as non-adults: Ageplay creeps me out, but as long as no actual children are involved and both sides consent I don't mind, neither does it cause actual harm.

* Physical restraint: This is pretty damn common, dare I say light bondage is almost vanilla. I have a friend who is relatively vanilla and even she has a pair of handcuffs in her arsenal.

* Humiliation: Again, as long as it's consensual, no harm is to be had.

* Strangulation: This is pretty much the only thing that's actually harmful, but like all BDSM things, consent, communication and safety are key.

* Facesitting: This targets femdoms in particular as face sitting is widely done by them. Again like all BDSM things, consent, communication and safety are key, and these small time porn producers know this.

* Fisting: Fisting, like all sex, has it's risk, but if you take precautions you should be safe and good to go.

What we are seeing is the Vanillfication of Porn. This targets kink rather than vanilla sex of any kind, and even then it bans things that are, for all intents and purposes, Vanilla. The people who oppose this face an uphill battle because to do so openly and effectively requires us to come out in the open, which few are willing to do. Those who do put their heads above the parapet will face ad hominems such as ""pervert"" and ""Well it's not what upstanding citizens do. Well you know what? If you are of age, and you and your partner is consenting, and you aren't killing yourself in the process, I say go ahead.

if you do, if you have a general anxiety about female candidates but not male, but can't give concrete objective reasons why one sex would be less well adapted the role, then yes it's a sexist view by definition.   it's up to you whether you want to do anything about it.

&gt;I don't see too many female Santa Claus figures this time of year, or female representations of Jesus, or hell, Robin Hood. 

There is absolutely no reason why the Doctor must be inherently male.  The Doctor is an alien.  You prefer your Doctor male.  That's sexist.  If I prefered my Doctor white, that would be racist, because there's no inherent race requirement.  Just because ""sexist"" and ""racist"" are bad doesn't give us the right to contort logic to argue that we're not being sexist or racist when we are.

You could argue that Santa Claus is by definition male, as are Jesus and Robin Hood, as they are based on real people.  I think that's bunk.  None of them are real, they are representations and symbols, and a female version of each would do.

Jesus is Jew from the Middle East, not a white man from Oxford, but most of the Christian world has no problem seeing him as one.  I assume you don't have any problem with changing the appearance of Jesus to suit a whim?

The Guardian has been especially crap at reporting this, they had a commentary piece explaining that the Vice article was sensationalised nonsense running on the same day as a headline piece which was a re-hash of the Vice article.

Does Rusbridger even read his paper or is he too busy lunching at the Savoy with other so-called public intellectuals? 


To give an example of the way the proposed reforms are being misrepresented... 

There is NO ban on bondage, you can still show bondage in internet porn, all that's changed is that it has to be POSSIBLE for the person to withdraw consent, they must be able to vocalise or gesture if they want to stop. So you're not allowed to show someone gagged and tied up to the extent that they can't communicate at all.  

That's it. 

It's not an attack on bondage porn, the point is to have a clear distinction between consensual bondage porn and actual-rape porn, for the protection of the consumer, so that they don't unwittingly view rape, as much as anyone.
 
If people want to protest these proposed reforms please go to the texts of the proposed laws and read the fucking things first, because this subreddit is looking just as idiotic as when most of reddit erroneously believed that Australia was banning porn with small breasted women last year.

- Second page of James Hay doc, ""Payment is made from a flexi access drawdown fund"". Indicates an income actually needs to be paid, TFC does not count as income because it is paid directly from the uncrsytallised vehicle not the drawdown arrangement.

http://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/extranet/literature/doc/FP0481

- Second page again, ""An individual commences a flexi-access drawdown fund (or converts a capped drawdown contract to a flexi-access drawdown fund) and does not receive any flexi-access income."" Referring to when MPAA is not activated, probably demonstrates what I'm trying to save better.

Essentially it is in place to ensure individuals can still withdraw their TFC without having an impact on what they can contribute going forward, similar to capped drawdown now. Only if they withdraw income will their contributions be limited by MPAA. (I have to explain this to clients, imagine how frustrating it can be trying to tell this to a 70 year old!)

Primarily, depth.  We've got 3 strikers on at once, Zarate in reserve, and while we all love Cole, I don't want to see him play a lot for us this season...  Especially with Sakho going to be gone for AFCON, I don't see this as realistic.

Second, we're cutting out a central midfielder with this formation, and I think that is one of our strengths.  We have Noble, Nolan, Song, Kouyate, Downing, and Amalfitano has put in some shifts as well.  Especially if we're wanting (hoping) to sign Song permanently we should show him he'll get as much play time as possible.

Let's keep our strikers as out and out strikers; Valencia and Sakho have shone at that position this year.  Carroll makes an amazing plan B, as well as playing better with a striker partner (he's a classic striker, lets play a classic formation).

I think we're better off using a 4-4-2 diamond as we have been, using our strength in depth (central midfield) instead of pushing our luck where we aren't as deep.

false,doom_halo,null,null,"To become a medical physicist in the UK, there are two main routes. The first is normally, after having completed a Physics degree, going on to study on the NHS scientist Training Programme (STP). This is very very competitive; about 50 or so places a year across the whole UK, with many many more applicants. I have a friend who started on it this year, and he got rejected and only got a place after someone dropped out, and he was getting high firsts and had a decent amount of work experience. I have no idea how the situation would stand with Visa requirements - it is a paid job, but that's something that would really depend on your personal situation. 

Alternatively, you could apply for a PhD here. However, for Physical Sciences, you need to remember that in the UK, you specialise earlier than people typically do in the US. Almost everyone going on to PhD here will have done a Masters degree first, normally in what is called an Undergraduate Masters which is integrated into a 4th year at the same institution. However, unless you're truly exceptional, you'll probably find it very very difficult to get funding for a PhD in the UK unless you've been a resident here for 3 years. It's now quite rare to get a PhD place here at all without a 1st class degree (which from googling around apparently equates to a 4.0GPA depending on the institution), and at least for my department, you need to be fairly above the borderline. Most PhD places are funded by research councils (EPSRC or STFC are the main Physical Science related ones although depending exactly on the topic of the PhD it might differ), as opposed to the University, and these have strict requirements to be eligible - you can see these restrictions here (https://www.stfc.ac.uk/1512.aspx). Universities do have some scholarships for International students but they vary by institution - I think Oxbridge fund more than other Universities in general due to the pretty large bequests they have.

If you're well off you can self fund yourself through a PhD, which is pretty uncommon, but you would be looking at something like at least £10k a year in fees + at least £6k a year on living costs, depending on the city, and you would not be eligible for any loans for this. Students typically take about 3 years to complete research and then spend about 6 months 'writing up' their thesis here, but some programmes now run to 4 years. This is very different to the U.S. system where you typically take further courses and sit exams for the first year or so and then move on. 

Edit: I'm not sure what you take to mean by Nuc Eng by the way, but over here, that basically means reactor design, maintenance, etc, so if your career goal is to do Med Phys then you should stay away from it. People are generally looking to specialise here when they take a degree at the level you're talking about, so if Med Phys is your interest, you need to look for that directly. Also, if you're looking at clinical work, I think the STP would be the best route. If imaging is more your thing, I seem to recall Sheffield have a good group (though don't quote me on that), and Nottingham certainly do (MRI was invented there). Birmingham have some medical imaging PhD's for certain.

false,burgleurgle,null,null,"I'm a physics grad from the UK who went to Canada for grad study, so maybe I can offer some advice:

Unless you're rolling in money I suggest that you investigate your funding options *extremely* carefully. Unlike in the USA/Canada, where STEM grad students are usually paid a stipend, in the UK the student pays the university (at least at the MSc level, PhD's in STEM subjects are usually paid). Since you'll probably be paying international fees that's gonna be expensive, even if you have British citizenship you'll probably still pay international fees as your fee status is based on citizenship+residency, not just citizenship alone.

Also beware that UK MSc's tend to be taught - i.e. a one-year course with a 3-4 month research project, although this is by no means always the case. In North America you're looking at a ~2 year course with ~1 year research project. That's a big difference in terms of the experience you'll get and could impact on how useful your degree is in the job market or for PhD application - this might be particularly important for you if you're planning on going back to the USA afterwards.

If you're considering further study the extra research experience from a longer North American degree might be helpful. A Canadian prof told me that he's somewhat wary about hiring UK students since they tend to have less research experience than their North American counterparts. Obviously that's anecdotal, so make of it what you will.

Good UK universities usually require a 2:1 or higher for grad study, which *very roughly* equates to 3.5/4.0 GPA in the North American system, but you will have to check with each individual university how they convert US GPA to UK degree class.

I see another commenter mentioned using UKPASS to apply. When I applied to some UK uni's a couple of years ago very few of them were using UKPASS, so unless the situation has changed you will generally have to apply to each university individually through their online application system.

We moved to Beswick in around 1997, well before the stadium was built and there was a lot of industrial wasteland.  Regeneration had already started somewhat with the velodrome being in place, but it was still a way off where it is now.  

There were a number of local businesses that were closed to make way for the regeneration, and my mum was saying that the afternoon that they got their hands on the last bits of land for the CFA the police swept into Grey Mare Lane Market and shut it down immediately (don't know if that's true or just one of those rumours you hear).  So there will be people with bad things to say, but the overwhelming majority (especially homeowners) will tell you how much improved the area is thanks to the investment.

My mum bought her house for something daft like £20,000 and by this point it's worth... I don't even know... well over £100,000.  She's got much better transport links than when we moved into the area.  My little brother works in rugby coaching and he's chuffed to bits with the community facilities that are in place now.  There's the college at the CFA too.

Despite the handful of local business closures, I'd think it's safe to say that there are likely more jobs in the area now, but aside from that, the place just feels more pleasant.  There are still plenty of people around that you'd be well-advised to avoid at all costs, but there even seem to be fewer of those than there used to be.",0,1418084458,null,0,false,0,cmp8nsi,t3_2onjoi,t1_cmp8nsi,t1_cmotbjl,null,1425533995,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

Those genetic differences certainly exist and, as a certified mutant, I've no issues with acknowledging my personal genetic differences from others, but saying that those differences can define a person and do anything more than exert a modicum of influence is utterly absurd, and to claim that a person of a certain sex could never have a certain kind of personality even more so.

To use a common quote with regard to genetics – 'genes are not destiny'. Genetically identical twins can end up looking quite different, and usually look slightly different. I have a genetic propensity for allergies so great that, according to my genetic markers, I should be deathly allergic to most allergens, yet I've never presented any signs of allergy. I have a friend who has never been in a fight and is one of the most pacifistic, chill people I've ever met, yet also happens to have genetic markers for heightened aggression. Yes, there are genetic differences, but those differences work as suggestions at best, and are by no stretch of the imagination definitive.

To say that there never could be a woman with a personality like the Doctor's is an illogical assertion contrary to the few things about neuroscience we know definitively that will not change as we grow to better understand the brain.

Depends on your grades. If you're getting like 3.7 to 4.0 (the grade conversions depend on the uni so make sure you look it up!), maybe Oxford or Cambridge. If you're at like 3.3-3.69, try the Russell Group (Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Southampton, Manchester, Edinburgh, UCL all come to mind immediately as urban ones, but that's not a full list so you'd do better off looking it up. Check out which do the course you want and then try to find out which has the best reputation for the subject. 

&gt;What are the requirements that most graduate programs have?

Depends entirely on the uni, I assume. Generally around a 2:1 (3.3-3.69) is fine, but it might be higher or lower for your course depending on the uni. 

&gt;What are the requirements that most graduate programs have?

I couldn't say for your course specifically. Good grades, for one, and the ability to pay. Contact the university directly if there's anything on their website you're confused about - they're very helpful normally!

&gt;Is there any other general advice you have for someone who has little to no knowledge about studying abroad?

Take advantage of the societies and stuff, maybe join a sport if you want to meet people. Be friendly and whatnot. I think you'll be fine, though, since you're a native English speaker and a postgraduate!

&gt; UKIP will cut the foreign aid budget by £9bn pa, prioritising disaster relief and schemes which provide water and inoculation against preventable diseases.

I understand that a lot of the foreign aid does help us by going to British businesses working abroad(if I understand it correctly) but it's money which could be invested in our own economy to help us here, it might not be a massive amount of money but it's certainly something!

&gt;UKIP will introduce an option for students to take an Apprenticeship Qualification  instead of four non-core GCSEs which can be  continued at A-Level. Students can take up apprenticeships in jobs with certified professionals qualified to grade the progress of the student. 

I think this is particularly useful for students, I know the Tories have done a lot for apprenticeships however this goes even further, apprenticeships are a good way of shaping the future as it allows somebody to get a good idea of how the industry works and make themselves a lot more employable.

&gt;UKIP will repeal the Climate Change Act 2008 which costs the economy £18bn a year.

I think that while a bit of climate change control is important, we aren't the ones in the world which need to be implementing this.


&gt;UKIP supports the recall of MPs as was originally promised in the Coalition Agreement, whereby 20% of the electorate in a constituency must sign a recall petition within eight weeks. The approval of MPs will not be required to initiate a recall petition.

This along with their policies on initiating national referendums on public issues is a very good way to have a full democracy in the UK.

That said, as a fan it can be incredibly irritating to read some of the stuff he says sometimes. Aside from the fact that he says a lot of things that rival fans can and do endlessly poke fun of, a lot of what he says just seems knowingly sugar-coated and it starts to get irritating. 

It was trademark of Hodgson and Moyes when they didn't seem to have a grip on what was going on at the club and were failing expectations to either make excuses for why we lost (bad luck, referee, 'not our day') or to claim that shit results were actually perfectly acceptable. It's starting to bother me that Rodgers seems to be slipping into a similar trend.

We were crap against Sunderland. When Gerrard came on we picked things up a bit, but ultimately we created two shots on target for the entire 90 minutes whilst playing at home against a side comfortably in the bottom half of the table. And rather than admitting we lacked good final balls, options up front, or a cutting creative edge in the final third, Rodgers says the players did everything they could and puts the draw down to how we needed ""a wee bit of luck"" and didn't get it. Like, is that really how he tells the players to go out there? Try your best and stay in the game, and then just hope that luck happens to go our way and we get three points? 

I get that the last thing the players need to hear after a disappointing result is the manager telling the media that they were shit, but at the same time I feel it would be nice for Rodgers to at least properly admit that we're playing seriously poor football right now. Either he's just lying and telling the media things which he knows are blatantly false or, even worse, he genuinely believes that we're just a bit of good luck away from consistently winning games again even though the performances are frequently abysmal. And if he can't give a decent reason why we lost then it implies he doesn't know why, which implies he's not going to be able to fix it for the next game. 

I'm sure he is completely different in front of the media to in front of the players, but either way he's still saying things in public that just seem stupid upon analysis, which makes him seem stupid and reflects badly upon the club for having him in charge. And as fans we only get to see how he talks to the press, not how he talks to the players, and if our only data to go off are interviews that make Rodgers looks like he's clueless then it gets difficult to hold faith in him. What he says in the press is his main outward appearance to the fans, and that appearance matters. If you hire a guy for a serious office job and he turns up dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops, you maybe don't give a shit if his work performance is top notch, but if it starts slipping then that appearance might suggest other issues and make you wonder if he's actually the guy you want. 

**tl;dr** Even though the media isn't Rodger's job, it would be nice if some of the stuff he said instilled a bit of confidence that he knows what's wrong, can sort shit out and do the things that actually *are* his job. 

And it'd just be nice to hear him actually tell it like it fucking is sometimes, instead of attempting to polish every single turd of a performance into a diamond for the media to the point at which it's starting to get incredibly frustrating to hear.

false,nvolker,null,null,"&gt; A small but vocal group wants to change a iconic male character into a female character to fit in-line with their ideas of social justice.

Being a male does not have anything to do with why the Doctor is iconic. The Doctor changes his face, personality, and apparent age all the time. Each new Doctor seems to have something that none of the Doctors before had, why is *gender* special?

I think the concept that you're failing to grasp is that *no one* is asking the creators to change the doctor's gender to satisfy some sense of social justice. Some people are just excited that, because of the weird Sci-Fi rules in the show's universe, a female doctor is *possible*. The possibility means that if the creator's artistic vision for the future of the show includes a female Doctor, they can easily execute that vision.

Preemptively complaining about the *possibility* of a female doctor shows that you think that *only* reason the creator's could have to change the doctor's gender is to play the ""look how progressive we are!"" game. It's very possible that the writers have some creative, interesting, and engaging stories that might work better with a female actor, or that a particular female actor could have a take on the Doctor that would enable the creators to write those kinds of stories.

Thinking that the show could *never* be as good with a female doctor rather than a male one is sexist.",0,1418088899,null,0,false,0,cmpax6l,t3_2oo4pv,t1_cmpax6l,t1_cmp7b6q,null,1425532940,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

&gt; ""We need other players to step up to the mark and take on responsibility and become the catalyst for the team and not just solely place it on his shoulders""

That's about as publicly as Rodgers is going to tell guys like Lambert, Lallana, Coutinho and Henderson that they need to stamp their authority on the game rather than leave it to Sterling and Gerrard.

&gt; ""We need that patience in the game...so we need to be able to move the ball from side to side to be able to penetrate""

(Kazran Sardick, A Christmas Carol - And maybe you can add something of your own to this one.)

Good luck!
