With that said, yes, you have a point that race plays a role in how these Muslim men chose their targets, and that they wouldn't abuse one of their own. That doesn't make the religion of the perpetrators more relevant though, because any abuser will naturally pick a victim that they can abuse without facing the approbation of their community, and that's why abuse takes place behind closed doors no matter the race of the perpertrator. Of course race is a factor in these events, but ostracising ethnic minority communities is hardly likely to bring them into the fold in protecting children and making them feel part of the community, half the reason these Muslim men were able to dehumanise the white girls so easily is because this kind of dehumanisation is a two way street and they are subject to it too from white people.

Really, the ""plot"" convenience of Vastra having an extra store of oxygen somewhere wasn't even plot oriented. It was solely to get Vastra's lips on someone else's lips.

Likewise, think of movies where you've seen CPR (this basic situation) in a non-romantically-involved pair. You don't normally get a close up view of it as this was.

true,englishmuff,null,null,"I get so tired of this. This child wasn't ""allowed to *have* an UZI"". She was allowed to *shoot* an UZI. 

She wasn't ""learning how to shoot"" either. 

This was entertainment. Right or wrong, since it's so incredibly difficult and expensive to purchase a **full auto** gun in the US it has become common for entrepreneurs to rent the experience of shooting a full auto machine gun to the public. This happens thousands of times a day in the US without incident. This was a freak accident. This was **very** poor judgement on the behalf of the ""instructor"". He paid the price. Unfortunately, the girl will suffer the most. It wasn't her fault. Bless her heart. The poor kid. And...the parents didn't ever expect that to happen either. What a tragedy. 

My point is, you can't blame the cause of this accident on **age**. I was shooting at 5. I was on a rifle team at 10. This accident was a string of errors. When teaching children responsibly about shooting (and I think that's a good thing) one must use judgement with regard to physical ability and aptitude. Not everyone is created equal physically or mentally. 

When I learned firearms as a child, I was taught with a single shot .22LR. I moved up from there but never was I given a full auto gun. I am 50 years old now and still have not shot an full auto gun. (I had the opportunity but didn't have the ammo at the time)

This is simply a case of very poor judgement on the behalf of the ""instructor"". I hope the ""entertainment"" firearms business learns from this, although I doubt it. 

I'm an avid firearms enthusiast and NRA member, but I guess a law preventing those under 18 from being allowed to handle a **full auto** weapon doesn't seem unreasonable. But I hate the punish the majority because of some freak accident. 

I have a son who is 17 and wants badly to go see the ""Big Sandy"" machine gun shoot in Arizona. They will rent you a machine gun there and he really wants to do that. He's 210 pounds and 6'1"", and very experienced in shooting and hunting. I'd hate to see him lose that opportunity. 

What a tragedy. I feel so bad for that little girl and the family of the instructor. 

And..for what it's worth, the UZI that was used in the accident, was chambered for 22LR, not 9mm as is most common. But it didn't make much of a difference did it?

Instead of saying ""you have to pay us"", it's a ""pay us if you want"". Forcing or heavily encouraging payment would be a money grab/demand; what DWL's devs done is more like a money request.

Fact of the matter is, devs have to make money somehow. IAPs are just one of those ways, and while sometimes they're signs of greed, sometimes they're more akin to a tip jar. And I'm a firm believer in tipping well.

To say they would drop to 5-7th is probably the most ignorant thing i've ever heard on reddit.

Back to the subject of defense:

 The likes of Lahm (best RB), Javi Martinez, Dante, Boateng, Alaba (imo best LB), Badstuber, and Bentita isn't something to over look. Then to add on that the world's best GK.

I'm wondering if you even know anything about Bundesliga. Schalke have a very strong defensive team (hit by injuries last year), but they are still very good. Gladbach have a solid defense too.

EDIT:
&gt; PL teams just dont sit back against such teams (possession based), they cause problems on counters 

Ok, here is where I wonder if you watch Bayern at all. They literally play their defense so well, you don't even have the ability to counter. Whenever they lose the ball, they act like a pack of dogs and chase you down until you fuck up, and regain possession. It happens so quickly too. It's literally the strongest part of their defense.

I respect your views, and I also believe Agnew's genuinely representing the views of many; including many people I know from nationalist backgrounds who self-identify as Northern Irish and don't care about a united Ireland as much as other social issues. I was raised Catholic, now atheist; just got my first Irish passport this year, don't really care which one I hold. I personally believe a united Ireland will (and should) come about in the medium-to-long term - tho' don't think the republic want us any more than GB does, and who could blame them. Stormont is a joke; I'm emigrating later today and happy to get away for a while (hence focusing on the positive by sharing that article). I think the ideal would be the federal republic with a 9-county Ulster being an inclusive region for all - feck knows how long that would take to come about. In the meantime I refer to myself as Northern Irish, or Irish if I'm abroad - nationality ranks pretty low down in my self-identity. I'm reading and enjoying Green Flag at the moment, watched the Salmond-Darling debate with great interest and am extremely interested to see how things shape up for Scotland this month.

And I agree with Steven's views, whilst respecting yours.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; Feel free to pretend that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, or that I think that people who went to other unis are ""plebs""; all it does is make it look like you have a serious inferiority complex. ""There are some ex poly grads who do know how to tie their shoes"". Jesus; paging Dr Freud.

If anyone has the complex, it appears to be you, because you seem to be under this idea that I keep suggesting that you're privileged. I haven't even mentioned it. I'm talking about the way you feel the need to select candidates based on their university, not about you personally. Projection?

&gt; The fact of the matter is, Oxbridge degrees are harder to obtain and are extremely well regarded almost across the board, except in very specific vocational subjects like medicine. A degree in, say, History from Oxford or Cambridge is worth more than the same degree from almost any other university. The work is light years harder, the teaching practices are far more focused and the curriculum goes deeper. 

Going by the oxbridge grads I've worked with, that doesn't appear to be true - they certainly aren't dim, but they're hardly mindblowing. You're assuming also that academic performance translates automatically into a brilliant employee with great practical skills - not so.

&gt; Discriminating on university choice? That's the whole point! You also get 'discriminated against' on experience, exam performance and a million other things, all through your life. Are you not familiar with interviews? 

Exam performance and experience are individual factors - going to the right university, and assuming that everyone from university X is better than everyone else, is not.

&gt; I can only imagine that faced with this choice you would be paralysed to make a decision, because to pick one over the other on the basis of their degree would be serious discrimination.

I'd have a decent enough interview process such that I wouldn't need to make flawed decisions based purely on where someone attended lectures and took a few exams.

Ergh.  A few weeks ago I was knocked off, apparently intentionally.  The driver told the police I'd been cycling erratically, and 'deserved it'.

What was amazing to me was the reaction of the police.  I was breathalised, they questioned me about my helmet.

I always ride with a helmet, I'm a bloke who has a lazy hair style *Grade 3 on the sides, choppy on the top to hide the widows peak* is my usual order.  So for me a helmet has no downside.  Heck it might even reduce drag.

But how the fuckity fuck did that matter.  I had hit the floor with my leg (fractured) and then elbow.  My head never got close to hitting anything.  Yet all of a sudden, I'm being questioned about it.

This attitude is so very wrong.  Jumping a red light, making others take action to avoid you, un-acceptable.  But why blame someone for not wearing a helmet.  We don't complain about pedestrians who aren't wearing helmets and knee pads, when they are hit by a car.

That being said, I would love for LFC to hold onto Lucas, and start to play him or Joe Allen at the base of the diamond. Stevie is not required in all of our games (especially games against teams with quick AM's and wingers), firstly because he doesn't have the legs anymore, and secondly, we actually do just fine without him.

In a diamond midfield (without Gerrard) Hendo, Couts, Lallana, Sterling, Can and Markovic all provide enough creativity, composure and athleticism in the middle that we can allow ourselves to have a true DM in the sense that the DM is there to intercept attacks and recycle possession.

Having that true DM position covered would also allow our fullback a little more freedom to press up the wing for overlapping runs, knowing that we still have bodies back to cover the counter of we lose possession.

I want Gerrard to play forever, and I want him to lead us back to the summit and get his winner's medal, but I can't help but feel we play our most complete football when he isn't on the pitch. We will miss his free kicks and calmness from the spot if he isn't playing, but Super Mario has that shit covered!!

You can witch hunt Pakistani men all you like, but those bottom feeding opportunistic scum (the perpetrators of such crimes, not Pakistani men as a whole ) were given the chance by state, local gov &amp; police officials who did not care (or were too concerned with their careers paths) about those they were charged with protecting enough to overcome their own fears of being accused of being prejudice.

This is something I see growing.  With increased automation of simple skills, we have lesser demands for low skill, but increased demands for higher skill.  With some of those demands being crazy.

A big problem in this is that we have a culture which doesn't value education, rewards failure and glamorises xfactor style lotteries.  I've used the example before, but I just remember being so astounded when waiting for a bus in Singapore some school kids (14 year olds I'd guess) were talking about their robotics projects, something that I used to teach.  All these kids were so enthusiastic about it, I couldn't help but evesdrop.  I ended up having to give an almost impromptu lecture when one of them had some questions about a LCS.  The desire to learn is very ingrained.

A contrast to the UK, when running afterschool club in a low attainment school, it was considered a success to get more than half a class interested.  Even then the teachers wouldn't bother putting forward a lot of the students.  Kids were even bulled for attending.

The US almost has a temporally embarrassed millionaire syndrome.

Ten was abandoning Pompeii after ensuring that it, and only it, would explode, sparing the rest of the planet, and also creating a fixed moment in time. Donna was begging him to help the citizens of Pompeii, she herself was crying to people not to run to the beaches, but to the hills instead.

He flatly, and coldly tells her that time can't always be re-written. Pompeii will die.

She responds that he doesn't have to save everyone, just someone.

We then see Capaldi praying to his gods as the city burns around him. A light appears in the smoke, and the Doctor saves him and his family. They make it out of the city safely.

So I think that Pompeii-Capaldi may have been significant to the Doctor and that particular situation on Trenzalore. He saved a man from a fixed point in time.

true,amongthewolves,lfc99,,"Most of our success from last season was utilizing a diamond midfield in a 4-4-2 formation. The only downside to this is that we'd be sacrificing the talent of our wingers to play this formation.

However, using a 4-3-3 has its downsides in which we would be playing with a lone striker upfront, which Balotelli can be used in, but Lambert/Sturridge shouldn't be used in that lone striker formation. Lambert/Sturridge feeds off another striker, so if we were to use them, they would need to play in a traditional 4-4-2 or 4-4 Diamond-2 formation.

In the traditional 4-4-2, we could use Markovic/Sterling on the wings, however, this would leave only two central midfielders, where I cannot see Gerrard playing in anymore. He works fine in a triangle midfield in a holding position, if he allows his two central midfielders to do the job of pressing and moving the ball forward. The thing with Gerrard is that he thinks he has to do everything and gets forward too much or closes down wide attackers(that our wingers should be tracking back and helping the fullbacks defend), which then leaves our two CBs exposed.

Ultimately, if we are to play Balotelli &amp; Sturridge together, then we have to play the diamond, but we'd have a headache in putting Sterling or Markovic in a more central role behind the two strikers, or having to take off either Balotelli or Sturridge to accommodate Markovic and Sterling if we want pace and width on the wings. Regardless, this is going to be a huge test for Rodgers this season.

&gt;The data, which was analysed by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), showed that more than a quarter of all cycling deaths in 2005-07 happened when a vehicle ran into the rear of a bike. This rose to more than one-third in rural areas and to 40% in collisions that took place away from junctions.

&gt;The 64-page analysis found that police attributed responsibility for collisions more or less evenly between drivers and cyclists overall, but this was skewed by the fact that when child riders were involved their behaviour was named as a primary factor more than three-quarters of the time.

&gt;With adult cyclists, police found the driver solely responsible in about 60%-75% of all cases, and riders solely at fault 17%-25% of the time

I did.  Did you?  Do you remember this bit:

&gt; Within the Council, we found no evidence of children’s
social care staff being influenced by concerns about the ethnic origins of suspected
perpetrators when dealing with individual child protection cases, including CSE.

and 

&gt; We were contacted by someone who worked at the Rotherham interchange in the
early 2000s. He described how the Police refused to intervene when young girls who
were thought to be victims of CSE were being beaten up and abused by perpetrators. 
According to him, the attitude of the Police at that time seemed to be that they were
all ‘undesirables’ and the young women were not worthy of police protection.

Sure there were broader issues in the council and police that meant that this didn't come out sooner than it should have done and the scale of the problem wasn't clearly known.  

But on a case by case basis this shows a serious breakdown of the police services.  They're not going to let someone off rape because they're worried about appearing racist.  What happened here was that there was a serious problem in protecting these children because they were seen as 'undesirables'.

This is why 11 of the 15 recommendations at the end are about safeguarding children, two are outreaching to the community to make sure that they report issues with children better and only one is tackling the issue of race (""if it exists"") in senior management.",0,1409300964,null,0,false,0,ck3lq9d,t3_2euknp,t1_ck3lq9d,t1_ck37qgn,null,1427301228,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

GR and L&amp;H were both mathematically pretty brutal and the workload was high, but the tutors were great about providing help so that made it easier. Biophotonics was a lot of fun. Mostly I enjoyed the particle physics modules (most of which are mandatory): QM, Thermal and Statistical Mechanics, and Nuclear and Particle Physics (optional).

&gt; Did you enter at level one or two?

I entered at level two, having done A-levels in England. It's not mandatory, but if you want to do the MPhys five years is a long time to be at university, especially when most of your non-Physics friends will do four years. If you enter at level two you'll find the first semester to be a little overwhelming, but after that you won't really notice the difference.

&gt; The limited choice in experimental work is a bit worrying, but as you say it's hard to know exactly where your passions lie before delving into the material. I still haven't settled on which direction I want to go.

I wouldn't worry about it too much for undergraduate. The early labs have got a wide variety of choice, so it's really only your dissertation that's potentially a problem, and that's no more than three months of your life so you'll get over it. Focus on building the skillset.

&gt; And speaking of that, what was your final year project?

I did a project on Physics education with [this research group](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/phys-ed/physicsedu_talksposters.html). Specifically, I did the work under the ""Animations for Chemistry Students"" section of [this poster](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/phys-ed/AK%20AAPT-2012-Poster.pdf).

It was a lot of fun: I wrote a fair amount of code (which I enjoy), and interacting with the early-year chemistry students was a really eye-opening experience for me.

&gt; Were you satisfied with the choices offered?

I was, yeah. It's kinda manic though, you'll get a big long list and you have to move quite fast to get the topic you want.

&gt; What do you do now?

I'm a software engineer now. I do a lot of open source work both on my own time and professionally. Some useful links are [here](http://lukasa.co.uk/about/) (in the unlikely event that you actually want to delve into my life!).

&gt; What is the general atmosphere among the students like?

I really liked it. The Physics students tend to develop a fair bit of camaraderie by the first 'honours year' (level 3), so you'll know plenty of people in the school - (which is good, you'll find yourself spending a lot of time there!

Otherwise, it's mostly small town and fairly positive. You'll see students _everywhere_, and you'll bump into people you know _all the time_. I never felt lonely or left out, and I'm confident you wouldn't either.

That said, the University's reputation for being a bit posh isn't totally unjustified, and there is some class-based social stratification. Not lots, but some. If that bothers you (it bothers me) you'll find it a constant low-level annoyance, but hey, you can just write angry articles about it for The Saint.

&gt; The Soviet Union also intervened during a civil war in Afghanistan in 1979 (Galegroup.com).  Brezhnev made it clear, that, in regards to the satellite countries, “none of their decisions should damage either socialism in their country or the fundamental interests of other socialist countries, and the whole working class movement, which is working for socialism.” (Pravda).

http://ibatpv.org/projects/soviet_union/Brezhnev%20foreign%20policies.htm

&gt;As Afghanistan descended into civil war, Moscow grew increasingly concerned. Committed to preventing the overthrow of a friendly, neighboring communist government and fearful of the effects that a potential Islamic fundamentalist regime might have on the Muslim population of Soviet Central Asia, specifically those in the republics bordering Afghanistan, the Soviets moved toward military intervention.

Because how can they know what's in the zip file if it's a whole different name?

Well let's assume your friend is the copyright holder of movie in question, as I'm sure neither of you would commit piracy.

You're right, someone being able to see what you're doing is extremely unlikely. You'd effectively be using your friend as a ""seedbox"". Assuming the data was sufficiently scrambled there'd be no way of telling what was in that torrent. I'd recommend using 7zip with ""store"" and ""encrypt filenames"".

At that point, there'd be no point in using a torrent. Your friend could just upload the encrypted archive (zip/7z/whatever) file to Dropbox or Google Drive or whoever. You could download it from there at much greater speeds than your friend could likely do directly. Or just have your friend host an FTP server with forced encryption, and then you could just browse and download at leisure. 

Torrents are great at sharing with a ""swarm"" of people. But if it's a 1-to-1 transfer, it's not what I'd use. BTSync might be a better choice than uTorrent or whatever, but it's still not the way I'd recommend doing it.

As for pavements - a few each week. If you consider pavement parking.....Its very very common in many built up areas of Norwich (I would say in these little areas 80% pavement park)


I do think though its marginally important not to play the ""I see motorists jumping lights"" game... The better comparison is speeding. Which is pretty common, which does kill and its something you generally wont see a cyclist doing.

In [replying to the /r/ukpolitics thread on this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2ewgtu/guardian_article_from_2011_criticizing_the_times/ck3m6qh) I looked at some of the numbers on child abuse from [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales).

The article this one is complaining about relies on the fact that 50 out of 56 people in one sample were ""Asian"" to create a narrative about ""Pakistani Muslim rape gangs preying on white girls"" yet according to the data somewhere between two and three thousand people are convicted of sexual offences involving people under 16 each year.

When you look at ethnicity;^1 in 2011 ""Asian"" people represented about 8.7% of those convicted (at most 17%), compared with 7.5% of the population. For ""White"" it was 80.9% (at most 89%) out of 85.9% of the population and for ""Black"" it was 7.6% and 3.3%. So while ""Asian"" people are slightly more lightly to be convicted, than non-Asians, it isn't by much.

But no - obviously it is a racial problem; which means that ordinary, upstanding White people can dismiss it and not worry about it - which seems to be what happened in Rotherham for 15 years.

Yes, technically under his management we came one kick away from winning the CL, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone that would say it was a result of Grant's management. Mourinho instilled the mentality in those boys that got them there. 

Grant was heavily under-qualified for the job, both lacking experience and actual UEFA coaching certifications. He was simply daft as a manager. He constantly made excuses for his shortcomings. 

Add all that to what was never confirmed, but widely speculated: That he was largely responsible for Mourinho leaving in the first place. It may just be a rumor, but many people said he forced Mourinho out in some manner. He was the director of football at the time and he was a close confidant of Roman's. 

I'm sorry, but this man was evil and had no place in Chelsea FC. Rafa may not have been liked by supporters, but he wasn't a backstabbing, halfwit that manipulated the board into dethroning the greatest manager Chelsea had ever had.

Given how keen you seem to make out that ex-polys offer just as good an education as Oxbridge, I'd be wary about throwing around accusations of projection

&gt;Going by the oxbridge grads I've worked with, that doesn't appear to be true - they certainly aren't dim, but they're hardly mindblowing.

OK let's just do anecdotes then:

1. Process of getting into Oxford: sit an exam equivalent to an AEA, pass four notoriously difficult interviews with written elements including the forensic dissection of an essay you've written, then achieve three top grades at A-level. Workload while you're there is three essays a fortnight, while attending lectures, seminars and tutorials. People I know doing the same subject at other universities - Edinburgh, Northumbria, LMJ, Bristol, Liverpool to name a few - had to get OK grades and then do a handful of essays per term. And that's just an arts subject - all the scientists I know were worked to the bone. A third of Oxford students have eating disorders, and plenty more have serious stress and anxiety issues as a result of dealing with the workload. 

2. People I know who dropped out of Oxford in the first year due to not making the grade went to other well regarded universities and found that the work was not only easier, but that the syllabuses didn't go as far as the Oxford one. Some of them ended up getting awards for being the best in their year, when they couldn't even *pass* first year at Oxford.

I'm not sure why you're so keen to make out that an Oxbridge degree is nothing special. It is. Not only is it harder to get into (only 3,000 places and 17,000 applicants per year) than other places, but the curriculum goes deeper and the workload is much, much heavier. A 2:2 from Cambridge is better than a 1st from the University of Steeple Bumstead. They're ranked among the best in the world for a reason. Most people don't find it difficult to accept this. You mentioned earlier that you work for a prestigious company so you're obviously able to assess and rank *companies* in terms of how good they are, how well they're seen in the industry. Why are you unable to do this for universities? 

&gt;You're assuming also that academic performance translates automatically into a brilliant employee with great practical skills - not so.

Nope. Every example I've used has been for *equally strong* candidates with only the university as the difference between them. Please just admit that, faced with hiring an engineer and choosing between two equal candidates, you'd pick the MIT guy over someone else.

&gt; I'd have a decent enough interview process such that I wouldn't need to make flawed decisions based purely on where someone attended lectures and took a few exams.

Come on man. University is more than just attending a couple of lectures and taking a few exams, and you know that. Following that logic medicine is just poking around in people and fixing them. Chemistry is just messing about with beakers. Biology is just stamp collecting. You're acting like the quality of your education shouldn't be a factor in determining who's suitable for a role. Picking the right candidate is about assessing the overall quality based on a ton of different factors including education. If someone has worked hard to achieve a degree from one of the best universities in the world then obviously that's an advantage for them, but it's hardly elitism. Are we going to stop 'discriminating' based on experience now as well? Is it elitist to favour someone who has 20 year's experience over someone with 6 hour's experience? No. Is it elitist to favour someone who has an exceptional degree over someone who has one from a university that hands them out like sweets? No. A valuable degree is worth more in the job marketplace than one that isn't valuable - I don't get why you can't accept this either.

&gt;Coming from the person who keeps projecting. I've had this discussion before with others, and it seems universally true that people who defend the ""Oxbridge/Russell Group first"" strategy hold degrees from those universities. I wonder if it's a case of personal interest getting in the way of things?

So literally everyone you've spoken to about this who actually went to Oxbridge is telling you that the degrees are harder, that they're worth more than non-Oxbridge degrees. They're considered to be better by pretty much everyone in academia and are consistently ranked as among the best in the world. From this, you draw the conclusion that Oxbridge is nothing special. Are you kidding me?

Do I have a personal interest in defending Oxford against accusations of elitism? Absolutely. The application process is rigorous and very difficult, but that doesn't make it elitist. It's extremely meritocratic, and people who manage to get in and then get their degree have something to be proud of. Of course people are going to get defensive when you're basically implying that they did well out of privilege, not talent. You hire the best person for the job, and in order to do that you take a lot of factors into consideration. The impressive achievement of earning a degree from a top-tier university should not be ignored in that consideration, and I'm not sure why you think it should be. You'd presumably be quite happy to differentiate between candidates based on other personal achievements - why should your degree be in some protected bubble? Are we going to extend discrimination law to cover the university you attended, now?

&gt;You could certainly argue that the quality of our politicians and a lot of the civil service is hardly a great advertisement for Oxford, Cambridge and the LSE...

I get that this is just a flippant closing remark (at least I hope it is), but the Fast Stream (which is the only really major area of recruitment for the CS right now) is pretty much blind on where you went to university. You're tested on a variety of competencies and they never ask you any questions about your university - as long as you have a degree you can apply. Despite this, there's a disproportionate amount of Oxbridge grads on the Fast Stream: how do you square that with the idea that an Oxbridge degree isn't anything to write home about?",0,1409304766,null,0,false,0,ck3mdsl,t3_2et3l4,t1_ck3mdsl,t1_ck3kvuv,null,1427300923,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I have no idea how much these 'middle-managers' draw as a salary but all they seem to do is walk about looking really sketchy while avoiding anything that looks like work or they fill shelves, which is not a good use of them imo. Also, when there's a cluster of these grey-suited middle-managers (when they're stacking shelves invariably) they get into a 'banter-vortex' where shouting about how amazing your Audi is, or making not-at-all veiled references to sleeping with other middle-managers, is acceptable apparently. They don't make eye contact with customers, I assume we represent 'problems' and are to be avoided. They're like Estate Agents in a way, same suits, same inflated self-worth, and absolutely useless but employed for some strange reason.

Then there's the hourly staff, the cashiers, bakers, drivers etc. They also cluster in groups, mainly it would seem to try and work out when they will see each other again as they all seem to be on a very chaotic work schedule and aren't told their hours much in advance. All I hear is them shouting 'I'm not in tomorrow now, they changed my day off, I'm in Saturday from midnight instead' or that kind of thing. I imagine these workers are in a constant state of despair not having a proper schedule.

There's a lot wrong with Tesco and this is only one element, but the managers are morons. ",0,1409305237,null,0,false,0,ck3mgj1,t3_2ewbk4,t1_ck3mgj1,t3_2ewbk4,null,1427300853,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,WilliamtheV,mcgannnew,new McGann,"I remember going to comic-con and actually getting to kind of do the equivalent. I remember when I was four years old, I was watching power rangers, and my mom stole the remote and changed the channel to PBS, Bill Nye the Science Guy was on. She knew I liked space and encouraged my love of science. I grew up watching Bill Nye (with the occasional Mighty Morphin Power Rangers break), and beakman's world and the occasional NOVA special. My father was a pilot in the army, and I remember him teaching me about how planes stayed in the air and how rockets worked. 

After my parents divorced, my mother, brother and I lived with my grandfather, who had an iron grip on the television remote. Thanks to him, we must have watched every single re-run of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Along with Nova and Cosmos. Since we had moved around a lot, I didn't have many friends until high-school, so I got into comics. Spider-man was my favorite.

So my ""heroes"" growing up were (in no particular order):

1. Bill Nye the Science Guy

2. Captain Jean-Luc Picard

3. Carl Sagan (Grandpa's a huge cosmos fan, so I had little choice but to become one as well)

4. Spider-Man and Batman

I started going to San-Diego Comic Con back in 2009. Since I started going, I got to meet Steven Blum (Voice of Tom from Toonami and about half of my favorite cartoons growing up), Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek), Richard Hatch (Apollo/Tom Zarek from Battlestar Galactica), Stan Lee, Brian Posehn, Eli Roth, and a few others.

But nothing will ever top Comic Con 2012. That was the year I met Stan Lee. He was doing photos and autographs. I'd never actually gotten one of those before, and I had some spare spending money, so I went for it. I walked into the booth, they had a camera and lighting set up. And there was Stan Lee, who had been there for hours meeting fans and taking photos. I was expecting him to be tired, (it was day three of the convention, maybe a little irritated.

Instead he looks at me, smiles, and pats my shoulder and says, ""Hey, thanks for your support! I hope you're having a good time here at the convention. Let's take a picture"". I mumble a response, he smiles, the camera clicks away, and I'm ushered out of the room.

I got to meet the guy who wrote my favorite super-hero when I was a kid. And he was kind and gracious, quite the opposite of many of the celebrities that set up autograph booths.

The following day, I attended a panel for the Nerdist, and got to ask Neil deGrasse Tyson a question. Sunday, the last day of the convention, I was looking for a poster for my girlfriend at the time, and I ran into him on the convention floor, he remembered me, laughed at a joke I told during the panel, and took a picture with me. He then goes on his way, and I freak out because I met two of my heroes from when I was in school, and they were awesome. I had always been told never to meet a ""hero"" because they'll disappoint you.

2013, I was in a crowd when Bill Nye appeared. He looked into the crowd, shouted ""CHANGE THE WORLD!"" Then ducked away to meet up with security to be escorted away.

tl;dr: I got to meet a few of my heroes, and it was the coolest thing ever. of all time.

It seems to me that:

1: There's no doubt that the perps were acting in a racist manner in the sense that they were one ethnic group targeting another.

2: The inability of local authorities to deal with the matter properly was probably motivated by a fear of appearing racist. PC gone mad etc.

3: It's likely that the perps were perfectly aware of (2).

4: Some of the press and some political figures are leveraging this to inflame paranoia about immigration etc. (Which is what you were saying, more or less).

I'm not implying that you or anyone else is a racist.

What I am suggesting is that (for the same misguided reasons action wasn't taken before) there will be a section of racist society that will take a particular interest in this case due, in part, to the perpetrators being non-white/asian/pakistani/muslim.

If we are to accept that racists exist, and they do, then that would seem to be a fair assumption for at least *some* of those currently taking an interest in this story.

What it doesn't excuse is the abuse, the lack of investigation, the cover-up, etc etc. - but as the newly released report rightfully highlighted, the concern that racists would take particular interest in this case (and would thus intentionally cloud the issue at hand) wasn't without merit.

On 1, the report found that many of the victims were of the same ethnicity as the perpetrators. The impression I got (speculating) is that the perpetrators of this sort of abuse are looking for vulnerable or 'easy' targets, rather than caring about race (or necessarily age). There's some interesting stuff near the bottom of [this piece](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-grooming-gangs/18739) suggesting that white victims may be over-represented due to the greater freedom they have. However it also notes that in one case the victim's different religion was found to be important. We don't really have enough data either way.

On 2, the fear of appearing racist was little more than a footnote in the report; it mostly focussed on the disbelief of local authorities and the attitudes of the police (not listening to victims, dismissing their stories etc.). Part of me wonders [more speculation] if ""I was afraid of being labelled racist"" is an excuse, rather than a real reason for their inaction. But it is one that certain newspapers like (and have been over-emphasising), perhaps as it plays to their narrative of ""political correctness gone mad.""

Without 1 and 2, I'm not sure 3 holds. But I'm with you on 4.

I'm also not sure it is just about the press attacking immigration; I think it is also about comforting their readers. This is a pretty shocking story - widespread child abuse, covering over a decade, repeatedly ignored by the authorities. It really should be making us look at our society as a whole and specifically the social and legal systems in place to protect vulnerable people. This kind of thing shouldn't be happening in our society. And that should make us uncomfortable.

But by deflecting it, and pushing the idea that this is ""evil Pakistani Muslim rape gangs"", provided the reader isn't a Pakistani Muslim, they should feel a bit better; it isn't *their* bit of society that has this problem, but those other people.

If you took a job in which you earned £30k, you would pay no tax up to the LEL, and then 20% on anything earned above that - in this case you would earn £26k after tax (10,000 + (20,000 * 0.8)).

If you earned £50k, you would pay no tax up to the LEL, 20% on anything between the LEL and UEL, then 40% on anything above the UEL. Your net on £50k would be £40k (10,000 + (30,000 * 0.8) + (10,000 * 0.6)).

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Every time I turn on the radio I hear another interview with a social worker, or a staff member of the council talking about how they knew exactly what was going on, but there was a culture of fear about doing anything.

This morning I was listening to a social worker talk about how one particular Pakistani taxi firm would pick up girl from children's homes, and they were even paid for by the council. Everyone knew where they were taking the girls, but they were told not do do anything about it.

There was one white taxi driver who was suspected of abusing girls, and the council stopped using his service immediately. 

If you actually listen to all sides of this story, it is clear that fear of racism did play a part. The front-line staff who have no reason to lie say so, and I see no reason not to believe them. 

There were many factors that lead to these girls being abused, corruption, incompetence, peoples attitude towards the girls AND racism. All of these factors played a part, and they all reinforced each other as well. You cannot separate them out and say one was the reason and the other was not, its a web of failure.

For example, someone gets a report about there being a problem with the Pakistani community, but they don't believe it and don't want to be labelled racist, so they suppress the report. That's incompetence and fear of racism. 

Things get worse, and they realise that there is a problem, but if people find out they knew about it before and did nothing they will get fired, so they have the report destroyed, that's corruption. 

This is what I mean by there being many factors at play, and you cannot say that only one is the defining reason for what happened. ",0,1409307541,null,0,false,0,ck3muov,t3_2ewfkq,t1_ck3muov,t1_ck3mn6r,null,1427300666,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

But does this make us happy? It seems not. We have found other things to worry about - material possessions, financial future, popularity, purpose, meaning of life, belonging. And these being things that our current technology cannot help with, it seems that we end up being more unhappy than ever.

Children are hit hardest by this because they have no experiences or even stories of experiences of the ancient human struggle for survival to compare their own struggles with. It's like that poverty analogy, the first generation pulls themselves out of the gutter and experienced the hardships of poverty, the second generation works hard to raise their standing because they have heard of the hardships of poverty from their parents. The third generation is then so removed from poverty and hardship, that they are effectively ""spoilt"", not because of any fault of their own, but because they simply have no poverty reference point to compare their own life to anymore. We are at that point now as a civilisation, where we've tackled the old problems of disease and death (to an extent) so long ago, that we've forgotten how it was to fear them. We replace them with other, modern, first-world fears and seems spoilt by comparison. But that's not our fault.

We are strange creatures indeed, we always want more. Even if we reach our goals, we just make higher, bigger wants to make ourselves yearn for. I'm not saying that the current generation's complaints are not valid because they are not as ""desperate"" - I think it's stupid when people say, ""oh but those kids in Africa are starving to death so you have no right to complain about *anything*"". Personally though, I'd still rather be unhappy about these ""higher level"" things than be worried about dying of dysentery on a daily basis.",0,1409308766,null,0,false,0,ck3n2r5,t3_2euskg,t1_ck3n2r5,t1_ck3l8eo,null,1427300562,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I get that the issue is about the practicalities such as money, but the issue is divisive and either way Scotland (and the UK) is going to have to deal with the consequences. 

I've lived in Scotland since I was eight years old. I was born in England and fully half of my genes hail from Austria, and the rest is a muddle of British.

I am a mongrel, but Scotland is my home, and I consider myself Scottish if nothing but because of the sheer dint of time I have grown and lived here. I also consider myself first and foremost British.

I wonder what happens to me if Yes wins. I wonder what happens to me if No takes it. Either way there are going to be some angry 'true believers' who will want to take it out on those of us 'not quite Scottish enough'. 

Yes or No, it's an ugly divisive subject, and whichever way the referendum goes, the losing side is going to take it poorly. Hell, even the winning side is likely to be arrogant in victory.

What really bothers me about this is how it's being used by care workers to shift blame.

Fuck them, even if it is true and not just a way to cover up the fact they either didn't know (or going by everyone else involved) simply didn't care I have no fucking sympathy for someone who puts how people might perceive them above the very fucking real welfare of the children it was their *job* to care for. 

If ""PC"" played a role at it all it feels to me like it was little more than a fucking excuse but I'll of course change my mind if any real evidence that says otherwise comes to light.

&gt;His troops massacred nearly everyone in the garrison and the town - which Cromwell justified as the ""righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches"".

Out of interest, how were bins managed back in the '90s before the use of wheelie bins? I agree that Edinburgh is a densely populated city that doesn't lend itself easily to bins etc.

That's why they need to be absolutely on top of waste collection. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that at the very minimum they need more bins and far more collections - and not missing collections etc. I have a friend in London who dumped his bin bag out on the street Edinburgh-style, which surprised me.

true,FiendishJ,null,null," * Music

You can find decent music pretty much anywhere you go. Choose where you want to be, and then look up what music or events are going on there during your visit.

* Arts, Buildings and Culture

Aside from London, which I assume you're visiting because everyone does.. Manchester, Bath, and York are good places for these things. Not exactly near to each other, so I don't know how much you can travel around the country, but if you can, these are good places.

* Urban/Crowded spaces turn me on

Obviously London. Manchester and Birmingham. Birmingham is actually *much nicer* than most people think - and is very central, it would be a good place to stop-off between London and The North, and a great place to catch some music, if there's any going on.

* Beer.

Personal preference, but the beer in the north is better. It's certainly cheaper. In most towns and cities now you can find a lot of decent bars with a good selection of beers. If you do head north I can recommend you some bars and pubs.

* Parks and outdoors

For me, Wales is the best place for the outdoors. Scotland is stunning - but almost definitely too far from where you're starting. The lake district and peak district are both also impressive. Outdoorsy-places are much more difficult to get to unless you're planning to hire a car

* Pubbing before sundown

You can do this literally anywhere. Again, once you've decided where you'll be, ask for recommendations on local pubs.

* I'm coming from Portugal

Cambridge is a really pretty city about an hour north, it's full of nice things to look at. 

Oxford is also a really nice city, it has the university buildings to look around and plenty of pubs. 

If you can get over to the Cotswolds for a couple of days there are some seriously gorgeous, quintessentially British towns and villages around there. There's bigger places like Stroud or Gloucester if you want more city, but the real attraction in that area is the countryside. 

Birmingham is England's second biggest city and has more canals than Venice. I live there and love it, but even I will say it's just another city that can probably be skipped if you need to prioritise your time. That said, have a look at a touristy website which I'm sure will sell it to you much better than I have! We have the original Cadbury factory which is a lot of fun, if you like chocolate. I can recommend a load of bars and pubs and eating places if you want. 

Manchester is another city further north of Birmingham that has a great music scene as well as a fun city to walk around. 

In London: Primrose Hill gives you an awesome view, Crouch End is a fun and lively little area with several bars and pubs, there is an awesome awesome sushi/Japanese restaurant called Dotori next to Finsbury Park tube station that you have to book on advance for because it's so busy, the Hunterian museum near Holborn tube station is fantastic and small, Camden markets are a brilliant way to kill a a couple of hours.

And that's a bit of a problem really, I'd say.

During Classic Who, the Doctor would encounter armies of them, sometimes whole empires of the and defeat them utterly - well almost.  

Despite that (some would say because of that), they clearly developed and became a major temporal and spacial power. The Time Lords take some action against them, via the CIA but, it seems stopping short of an outright frontal attack of them, until they are in a position to challenge the Time Lords.  

Then the Last Time War happens. Gallifrey is gone and only a few dregs of the Dalek empire survive.  

Once again, despite the Doctor's involvement, they increase in power again, and he almost destroys them again, and again, and again.  

Should Gallifrey return, we would presumably have the Doctor and a prepared and experienced planet full of Time Lords who are going to be putting the elimination of the Daleks as a top priority.  

Are they going to achieve that? And lose the most iconic villains from the show? I doubt it.  

Are they going to ""almost"" achive it - i.e. just the same as the Doctor alone has been doing for centuries, so making the rest of the Time Lords seem pretty much a waste of space/time.  

Or are they going to decide that they don't really care about the Daleks any more, leaving the Doctor to face them alone again. This seems unlikely - unless there is a Time Lord traitor manipulating their policies in this way, and somehow keeping public Time Lord support whilst doing so.  

Or is the Doctor going to come to the Dalek's defence when the Time Lords attack and try to eliminate them entirely? Given his history with them, post *Genesis* it seems unlikely, but it might make for an interesting storyline.

But it has to go somewhere and until we figure out a better system of recycling more waste, not creating as much waste in the first place, scaling back on packaging etc etc, then the reality is that it needs to be dealt with and it's the job of the council (and waste/recycling companies they subcontract) to do that. 

I'm afraid the council is responsible for this, irrespective of there being too much waste. Plus other cities manage to deal with it (none brilliantly, no doubt, but far more effectively than Edinburgh). If they can do it, why not us?

Furthermore, our complex has a range of massive, industrial size recycling bins that are also often overflowing - because they're not emptied when they should be! I'm talking paper, glass bottles, recyclable packaging, food waste, i.e. stuff that doesn't just get dumped in a landfill. Plus my wife and I (like many other people) go to great lengths not to be mad consumers, to recycle literally everything we can possibly recycle, compost our food and so on.

But aside from general waste bins, if the council (or the companies they employ) can't even service what can be recycled effectively before it overflows onto the streets as trash, then where does that leave those of us trying to do our bit for the environment?

&gt;

&gt;___Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life___ (1993) is a short comic film for [BBC Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Scotland). Written and directed by [Peter Capaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Capaldi), it stars [Richard E. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant) as [Franz Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) and co-stars [Ken Stott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Stott).

&gt;The title refers to the name of the writer Franz Kafka and the film *[It's a Wonderful Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life)*, directed by [Frank Capra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra), and the plot takes the concept of the two to absurd depths. The great writer is about to write his famous work, *[The Metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis)*, but inspiration is lacking, and he suffers continual interruptions.

&gt;In 1994, the short won a [BAFTA Award for Best Short Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Short_Film). The [following year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67th_Academy_Awards) it tied for an [Academy Award for Live Action Short Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Live_Action_Short_Film) with *[Trevor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_(film\))*.

- He still looked uncomfortable creating attacks for himself and some aspects of his game are clearly still not there, which was especially evident in the first half.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;So if you thought a child was being abused, you took it your boss and he ignored you you'd just say ""fuck it nothing else I can do then""?

I like to hope I would do what most of the people in that situation seem to have done, and did my best to help the children with the power and resources that I had. Try to convince them that they were being abused and taken advantage of, try and help them as best I could. 

Or I might do what some of them did and leave the profession all together, because being in that situation, where you know children are being abused and you cannot do anything about it must be absolutely devastating, especially to someone who has chosen to dedicate their life to helping people in those situations. You have absolutely no right to judge them.

Again, what more can a front line social worker earning £25,000 do when the people above them shut the door on them.

The problem is the manner in which we work and compete with one another leads to alienation. It is not innate in human beings to always desire more. It is innate, however to respond to marketing and stimuli specifically designed to create a sense of urgency and incompleteness. 

Sure, you can't make someone do something they wouldn't otherwise want to do, but you can be highly suggestive. You can use devices like Photoshop, plastic surgery or even make-up to make people seem more appealing. You can make suggestions like ""why don't you have an ice cream"" when people weren't even thinking about food.

You can associate certain behaviours with products (like going out at night with alcohol) or watching sport with gambling.
You can do this with lifestyle advertising that sells people their ""dream homes"" and place it between targeted programmes that show you ""how easy"" it is to buy and sell property.
If you plug this enough the association can become strong, if the association isn't fulfilled the subject will likely feel unhappy as a result. When has a child ever had a ""perfect"" Christmas; what a ridiculous concept yet its sold to us *for about 3 months every year of our lives.*

http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/2evho7/what_the_fuck_is_nationalism/

I'll say here what I've said there. Nationalism is not one cohesive ideology. It's a collection of ideologies. The politics of the SNP or Plaid Cymru is about as different from those of Jobbik and Golden Dawn as is humanly possible. Sure, the concept of the nation is central to the ideologies of all of the above, but there the similarities end. 

These sorts of titles - both that of the article and this thread - are nothing more than knee-jerk reactions to a word which carries an inordinate amount of emotional baggage. If someone calls themselves a nationalist, that actually tells you remarkably little about their politicial views. Sure, there are nationalists who are socially conservative, who see the nation as a matter of ethnicity, and who have chauvinistic and even jingoistic tendencies. There are also nationalists who take a more inclusive, outward-looking view, regarding nationality as a civic identity and wanting their nation to play a full role in the international community. Contrast the pro-European, pro-immigration policies of Plaid and the SNP with the increasingly insular, Eurosceptic position that the Conservative Party finds itself in. And yet, the author of the article would have me believe that it is Alex Salmond's party that are the ones that should be feared.

Well, sorry, I don't see anything to be feared in mainstream Scottish Nationalism. Nor do I see anything particularly frightening in the British nationalism of the Labour and the Conservative parties (oh yes, Unionism is another form of nationalism).

Either result could see a surge in anglophobia north of the border, if the existing anglophobes either (a) feel vindicated and thus become more agressive and vocal, or (b) become butthurt and blame a No result on residents who were not born in Scotland being No voters (or so they assume, I know at least 1 person who would vote Yes dispite not being native born Scottish). And I think it's something that shouldn't be stiffled, if people have such a concern about Anglophobia or xenophobia, by off-hand dismissals that it could be a possibility, because whether it ends up happening or not, people right now are worried about it possibly happening, so it's going to influence how they vote, so it's a relevant topic to discuss in the context of how people might vote.",0,1409312154,null,0,false,0,ck3ns3k,t3_2ewmvj,t1_ck3ns3k,t1_ck3nobh,null,1427300232,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For self seeking reasons local council and authority figures don't want to (or refuse) to know about it. 

So Coppers don't investigate because it's too much paperwork for too little reward and it avoids potential accusations of racism and the resulting conflict with the local politicians and council officials who really don't want to upset their support base. 

So the perpetrators carry on because they see no one is doing anything about it.

So social workers and care staff  are hamstrung after seeing no intervention by police and the sheer persistence of the perpetrators so can do little to intervene. 

So, as no one is rocking the boat then politicians and local officials and authority figures can claim not to know anything about it. 

So coppers don't investigate...and on and on it goes

Salmond was absolutely right back then in 1992.

He's been proven right concerning the ""sterile"" arguments of Labour and Conservatives.

But his political motivations may be right but his method to bring Independence is wrong.

For Salmond he believes the EU is his salvation to Independence. This is not Independence.

Exchange:-

Scotland - UK (Political) Union 

For

Scotland + EU (Political) Union

The failure is attempting a Big Bang! Independence. Imho the solution is:-

1. Devo-Max settlement from No vote.
2. Brexit from EU into EEA
3. Scotland = More Powers + Pound + Single Market + UK Union + 4th largest trade bloc with it's natural neighbours to the North Iceland and Norway of which it shares a great deal for it's economic interests as well as rUK.
4. Future opens up consecutive progressive options (eg Monetary/Fiscal options if those make sense).

OT: Nice to see how much more polite and accommodating of different arguments and speeches made back then.

It's exactly the kind of baggage that needs to be reviewed, accepted and put behind us.  

Why do we spend so much time looking back?  It certainly does not seem to do any good if all it does is reinforce the old hurts.

A consequence of this rearward approach is that one of our major exports is our talented and enthusiastic youth who leave to get away from this backward island.  My own family (Brother, Cousins and Children) are not untypical of this, they're dispersed around the world China, Scotland, England, Canada not intending to return.  I'm sure some would suggest that a United ireland is the magic panacea; personally I don't see that one as a goer. Or we could stick with the status quo and keep our heads firmly tucked between the buttocks of history. 

Or we could try something else ...

But then I'm just a hopeful romantic. ",0,1409312488,null,0,false,0,ck3nuz0,t3_2ev1tp,t1_ck3nuz0,t1_ck387bn,null,1427300196,-4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-4

&gt; Because my main conclusion from my investigations is that if I had a vote, I would not be casting it purely on the basis of the economics - because it does not seem to me that the amounts of income and wealth at stake are life-changingly huge: Scotland, certainly in the longer term, is likely to be a relatively rich and successful economy on either road.

&gt; What matters far more, arguably, is how Scots see themselves in a much broader sense, either as a confident nation that is proud of being part of a bigger country, the United Kingdom, or as a people stifled and limited by the historic union.

I was born, raised and live in London, but my mum was from Manchester and dad from Perth.  I can understand why people would want to vote Yes and I can understand why people would want to vote No.  Nationalism doesn't often come into it.  What is clear, especially from looking at the voting trends of MPs in Scotland, is that if Scotland was on its own it would have a much more left wing government than the UK is (1 Tory MP in 2010, 0 in 2005, 1 in 2001, 1955 since the Tories topped the number of MPs).",0,1409312683,null,0,false,0,ck3nwpy,t3_2ewltd,t1_ck3nwpy,t1_ck3mxar,null,1427300172,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That being said bringing someone in would be nice, either an experienced older GK or someone young who will fight and compete more directly with Mignolet.

I know several who are voting Yes despite not being born here.

I think that the notion that the Yes side are going to be uniquely vindictive following a No vote is the result of a constant stream of articles like this demonising 'nationalists'. I mean, you could read the comments section of any Mail or Telegraph article about independence and find as much bile and vitriol as in any of the 'cybernat' stories that got so much media attention.

It's been a constant theme from Better Together - ""we're just as proud of Scotland as you"". Nobody said they weren't, bar the aforementioned tiny minority of idiots.

It's quite silly isn't it?

[Civic nationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism), as opposed to ethnic nationalism, is a non-xenophobic form of nationalism compatible with values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights. 

From the article I linked:

&gt;In the United Kingdom, the following parties can be considered civic nationalist: the Conservative Party[8] who advocate British Unionism, the Ulster Unionist Party, who promote Northern Ireland Unionism, the Scottish National Party[9][10][11] and Plaid Cymru (The Party of Wales),[11] which advocate independence from the United Kingdom, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party,[12] which supports a United Ireland.[12] Sinn Fein, which also supports a united Ireland could also be considered civic nationalist.[13]

There isn't anything wrong with civic nationalism, the whole point is that the state derives all it's legitimacy from the participation of the populace. If independence is the 'general will' of the people then so be it. Likewise, as Salmond has even said himself, if staying in the union is the will of the people then that is what will have to be done.

Trying to say the independence movement is based on some idea of 'Scots Supremacy' is laughable. That's why nobody is mentioning the 'N' word, as the author suggests, because it is so far removed from what we know the debate to be about.",0,1409313032,null,0,false,0,ck3nzw5,t3_2ewmvj,t1_ck3nzw5,t1_ck3n6yz,null,1427300131,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

We are projected to be the EU's largest economy by 2030 too, although I admit that I am less bothered about staying in the EU. However if we did, we could find a way to recalibrate our relationship with the commonwealth significantly. This should help to hedge our national interests away from subservience to Brussels.

Id like Scotland to stay first and foremost, but if they did decide to go I'd hope that it would be to become a European version of Hong Kong. 

However the Yes vote seems to be fully aboard the Lemming Express, and I can't see them achieving their potential with the SNP. Thats just my uninformed **opinion**, but AS doesn't strike me as an especially intelligent or charismatic guy, rather an opportunist.

*Ive also heard that there is a tsunami of dirt on him, waiting to be deployed at the right moment. However I have not been told details of anything. With the current exposé's on Parliamentary depravity, I can guess, but thats all* 

Id love Scotland to stay and be empowered into a HK model or leave and do the same, rather than stay in the UK and keep the Labour Party alive, or go independent and let the SNP drag them over the cliff. 

Scotland is a great place, brilliant minds, hugely valued in the UK, but this isn't our choice. We can respect their choice, and hope they make the right one.

Whatever the case is, Scotland needs to break free from the shackles of Westminster, either politically **or** economically. Id say that the later is more important. Benefit culture might save someone in the short term, but as a long term policy it is disastrous.

Also, Im really excited about plans to boost the North. UK is too balanced towards London, and I would love to see some other cities became major centres of commerce again. Its a long time coming and there is some much talent on offer and opportunity outside of London.

What I would love is for the Government to replicate the Canary Wharf policy for finance but for tech start ups, in somewhere like Liverpool or Newcastle. We would likely see a big spread out from London into new tax efficient areas, giving a boost, and opportunities to neglected areas.

The famous Soviet geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943.[9] Hermann Joseph Muller (and his teachings about genetics) was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoting fascism so he left the USSR, to return to the USA via Republican Spain.
&gt; In 1948, genetics was officially declared ""a bourgeois pseudoscience"";[10] all geneticists were fired from their jobs (some were also arrested), and all genetic research was discontinued. Nikita Khrushchev, who claimed to be an expert in agricultural science, also valued Lysenko as a great scientist, and the taboo on genetics continued (but all geneticists were released or rehabilitated posthumously). The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.
&gt; Thus, Lysenkoism caused serious, long-term harm to Soviet knowledge of biology.

If Vastra were male, you would not be crying "" unnecessary and gratuitous "" you would just be bitching that it was so heavy handed, instead of letting the characters actions speak for themselves.

That's actually a complaint of my own. Let Vastra and Jenny simply /show/ they are married. It's bad writing on Moffat's part that he hits us over the head by literally saying this character is married to that character.  Complain about that all you want, but it does NOT make the kiss in any way, shape, or form unnecessary. And it's not like they were tonguing each other, just a simple kiss, so it wasn't gratuitous.

Again, stop being defensive and really, honestly, critically evaluate your reaction. The writing of their marriage is kind bad, yes, but that doesn't mean the kiss was somehow porn. If it were Rory saying he was somehow magically plastic again and didn't need air, so he kissed Amy, no one, not a single person would have called it ""gratuitous"" or ""unnecessary"" they would have made an offhanded comment about how it made no sense, and how we didn't need reminding they were married. That's it.

It's homophobia, plain and simple. Not ""fuck gay people"" homophobia, it's subtler than that. It's ""they shouldn't be showing gay kisses on TV"" homophobia. Not too far from how Will Smith and Eva Mendez is fine, but you better not fucking cast a white woman marrying the black guy. It's subtle, but still racism.

Homophobia doesn't mean you hate gay people, it just means you don't accept it as normal, you have a fear of homosexuality. The same reason Will Smith couldn't marry Karen Gillan is why Vastra and Jenny ""can't"" kiss on screen. And, quite frankly, it's why they have to SAY they're married.

I often wonder is it because i'm one of those people who wants to just witness monumental change or is it for a more profound reason? dunno.

I've worked in Scotland, London, NI etc and Scotland is miles apart from other English cities i've worked in, they've got a very different identity.. yeah there are stuff at the top of the tree like GBP and the Queen that are common, but you dont go to the pub to talk about the queen on a friday night.

If they left, I dont think they'd become just another forreign neighbour such as Belgium or Netherlands, I could imagine they'd be forreign but 'not a forreign country' such as Ireland is... In that they have roughly the same ideals, aspirations as the rest of the UK.. fish n chips with peas etc, not chips and mayo... 

I do think the idea of bragging about ones self, being a pompus twat at an oxbridge school and running the country doesnt really sit well with most celtic types, works fine for the English but I see the Scottish, Welsh, north Englanders and Irish as being a bit more grounded and not too full of themselves..  Being Ruled by Cameron and his cronies who are the antithesis of all that celtic people stand for and are is distasteful, fuck thatcher and all the wealth of the south east, there are bigger priorities etc...  And it would appear that there is a trend towards elitism that has been going on for a while, making the relationship increasingly sour.  Boris Johnson and George Osbourne wouldnt last ten minutes north of the border imho

does that make sense? i've been drinking.


EDIT.. i'm blethering...

I think it'd be an interesting change to the entire UK if they went solo..
Labour wouldn't be in power again giving us a conservative government forever.. will that end in revolution?

If the entire landmass of GB isn't in the UK, NI doesnt have a snowballs chance in hell. (interestingly, all this pleading with scotland to stay.. you know if it was NI up for a vote, there'd be none of that, it'd be 'please fuck off')  Would the politicians in NI actually make Peace with each other?  What would we actually do?

Would Wales decide to go away?  Could, Wales+Scotland+Ireland form some sort of not-government but close alliance with each other without england? Could that benefit everyone?  3 countries of roughly the same size rather than 3 small countries and a big one with different priorities?

Do people feel that they're almost treated like the children of England?  I think we do to an extent.

What would it do to the world with the UK being some touristy stuff in London with Brum Manchester and Liverpool tagged on... Who would moderate the stupid actions of the americans? Would we have any clout in the world? Would it matter?

* Bushmills / Giants Causeway - Dont care how clichéd it is, its fantastic for anyone who hasnt seen it. Whisky stores are always interesting to go to, and for a few samples. The causeway is amongst nature at its best too.

* Sliebh Donard - Its a mountain, lovely forest, and its climable in about 5-6hrs with the slowest of groups (up and down). Theres something rewarding too for anyone who has yet to do it.

* Belfast Giants - Yes theres hockey in Scotland, England and Wales (the EIHL) but youd be surprised how many people have never actually been to a game. I have English relatives who are from Sheffield and only started going to Steelers games and supportint Sheffield, after I brought them to a Giants game and they realised they had a team on their doorstep thats a great night out, and a decent level of sport too.

* Dublin - Strictly not the north, but its 2hrs away. I wouldnt turn my nose up at a drive from Sheffield to Scotland because its in a different ""country"" and only a few hrs away. Dublin has everything that we have and more, especially for anyone looking that faux-authentic Irish fill from pubs.

true,skwinter,lfc68,,"In regards to your last point, people always bring up how much more one footed left footed players are due to always being played on the left by coaches during their youth, but if you are a CB which I think Sakho has been for most of his life, you don't develop that same kind of dependance. Anyone who plays in a central position needs to be able to use both feet adequately. Yes, you'll have a preferred foot that gets used more often, but I sincerely doubt that having two left footed CBs is going to be at all different from two right footed ones. People just notice a lefty's dependance more because it's unusual, just selectivity bias.

Edit: I'll answer the other points since I already went to work on the other one.

1. Don't know, will be easier to tell when we have a settled back four, but they are making some basic mistakes that good training should work out.

2. As a former keeper who actually got decent training back in the day, I think Mignolet's biggest problem is confidence and he needs to sort that out. If he gets that sort of cocky mindset that keepers like Neuer have (and I never did) then he'll be hugely improved on the crossing situation and directing the back four. His positioning is usually spot on, aside from Aguero's goal on Monday, and his reactions and instincts are really good. Distribution could use a little work as he's a bit slow, but I think it's better than it looks.

3. Johnson is not as bad as people on here make him out to be, but he does not look particularly inspiring most of the time. His poor decisions offensively results in too many turnovers where he's immediately caught out of position, and on top of that is weak in the air. If he's already in position he actually defends well (on the ground) and generally communicates well with the back four, but all the turnovers are really what kills us and is why he's been so lambasted by everyone in the comments. Can't keep an attacking flow with him giving it up or slowing it down so much.

4. We'd have to see how Sakho pairs with Lovren as well as give it time for Skrtel and Lovren to get a feel for each other. It's hard to say, but I'd echo what others are saying and give Sakho and Lovren a shot because I like proactive defenders. Only problem is coordinating two players like that, as there still has to be really good communication as two leader types can cause positional problems for each other - see Kompany and Demichelis last year as an example and how they've been defending this year and the tail end of last year to see that it can be worked out eventually.

So, I think it's important to understand how this climate came about.  And part of that story is how the Guardian has, for years now, consistently attempted to portray any criticism of Islam or muslims in the UK as inherently racist and discriminatory.

But even more than that.  This particular story is a scandal in itself.  It's showing how a Guardian columnist was leveling charges of racism against the Times for investigating Pakistani Muslim rape gangs.

I'm not a closeted racist.  I'm not a racist.  I'm not even right wing.  But here's the deal.  Either reasonable people will start to allow a free discussion about Islam or unreasonable people and extremists will start to gain support.

Soldado played poorly but I know his quality, and he is just having a poor time adapting, but is in the same boat as Paulinho, that even for a player of his quality, even a few half chances should somehow sneak their way into the net, but he was just so out of form.

In TV and film, calling something unnecessary and gratuitous is pretty much accusing them off putting porn in the show.

What irks me is people immediately jumping to the ""race"" discussion:

""GRR! it's their sick archaic culture/race/backwards religion that's causing these children to be raped!!""

Fine, that may be the case, it may not. But that isn't the main issue to address at this point. The issue is that these awful crimes happened and they weren't only ignored, but *deliberately* covered up by people we should be able to trust. That's the real issue here; it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with cowardice, incompetence and negligence. Had these crimes been properly reported in the first place, maybe thousands of children would have been saved and maybe we could have been having a rational, long term debate about what potential cultural influences might be causing these crimes.

But it's too late now.

The people who covered this up will probably get away with it too, precisely because nobody can look past the race of the offenders, or the cries of ""B-B-but, I was scared of being called a racist!""

Of course, this is a pathetic excuse, how would you be called racist for presenting the facts. Fact is, black people are generally poorer than whites in the USA. That's not a racist statement, it's a fact. No one is going to punish you for stating a fact.

The real issue here isn't race, religion, or culture; it's abuse and negligence. And the more we talk in circles about political correctness and race, the more we are distracted from what's really going on here: the authorities do not give a single solitary **shit** about vulnerable people. That's the *real* cultural fuck up here. That's what we should be all talking about.

If I recall correctly, his estate has a contract with the BBC which says that the BBC *must* feature the Daleks at least once per season, or lose the rights to use them completely.

Personally I'd be happy to see them disappear completely, but I think we're likely to be stuck with them for a long time to come.

The estate of Terry Nation has been known to be run to the lawyers at the slightest hint of IP rights violations, even though the BBC itself is usually pretty relaxed about its own intellectual property - not least since its own archive of classic DW episodes was partly recovered from fan recordings which other broadcasters may have called ""pirate copies"", and much of the current production team started out on unofficial ""fan-fiction"".

    ""Safeguarding Your Children From Misuse of Blood""

    ""When there is a crisis, elders may consider it advisable to arrange 
    a 24-hour watch at the hospital, preferably by an elder with the 
    patient’s parent or another close family member. 
    Blood transfusions often are given when all relatives and friends 
    have gone home for the night. ... What if a doctor or a hospital 
    intends to get a court order to transfuse your child? Is this the time
    to quit, assuming that there is nothing more that can be done? 
    By no means! It may still be possible to avert a transfusion. 
    Preparation for such a possibility should be made ahead of time. ... 
    But it should be made clear to all concerned that you, as parents, 
    feel an obligation to continue to do all that you can to avoid a 
    transfusion. This is your God-given responsibility. It is not 
    transferable.""

&gt;The real issue here...

But can't there be more than one factor?  I think you're absolutely right that corruption, negligence and incompetence played a role.  Does that mean that talking about other factors detracts from that?  

I really don't get the new line of defense being pushed on this page.   That it must either be one or the other.  That either Pakistan Muslim culture and fears of being labelled racism were factors OR negligence and incompetence were the reason.  I think *both* are important parts of this story.

I've spent a considerable amount of time attempting to increase my personal understanding of the EU and it's relevance to the UK. I've not spent that time to be dismissed with the aspersion of ""pretty insane"" inference, you can trust my sincerity when I tell you that! :)

&gt;*How much power do you think the EU has?*

I show you a simple diagram: [""The Evolution of EU Competencies"" (aka Policy Powers) Over Time and Per New Treaty](http://s1004.photobucket.com/user/Suri42/media/Treaties_Sovereignty.png.html)

You can then investigate any particular policy power and Treaty transition of said powers aka ""sovereignty) as it appeals to you.

&gt;*The scottish parliament will still make most of the decisions...*

Yes, but the question is ""When?"" Looking at the transformation of the EU per Treaty Change:-

ECSC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU -&gt; Federal USE

Some of the rules of this progression logic:-

* Subsume more sovereign powers over time
* Assume more members and their sovereign powers over time
* Never return sovereign powers once taken
* Subsume by Engrenage economic convergence to precipate political integration.
* Never integrate large powers too soon in case it breaks the Engrenage process.
* Avoid popular referendums as much as possible and circumvent via inter-governmental agreements unless a major Treaty change is the only solution.
* input a self-amending legislative process (Last Treaty = Lisbon Treaty) so small changes can be converted post-parliament voting autocratically.
* Expand influence into global governance bodies
* Use community method and ""beneficial crisis"" to promote further integration in member and applicant member countries.

So I ask you, if you believe the EU Political Union sustains Scottish Independence or otherwise?

Please note:-

* Europe =/= EU
* EU (Political Union) =/= EEA (Single Market Access)
* Range of relationships of the EU:

1. WTO
2. Customs Union / Associate Membership Status
3. Bi-Laterals
3. EEA/EFTA
4. EU without EURO legally (UK only)
5. EU
6. EZ

There's other relations eg Favored Nation Status for Japan and various others for other countries.

We could look at the private schools for ways to improve, since they are doing the best, instead of deciding to remove them because they give the best results.  Abolishing them will simply mean parents with enough money for private schools will send their children to private schools overseas.  This benefits no-one.

&gt; 
By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. **Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.** There was too much reliance by agencies on traditional community leaders such as elected members and imams as being the primary conduit of communication with the Pakistani-heritage community. The Inquiry spoke to several Pakistani-heritage women who felt disenfranchised by this and thought it was a barrier to people coming forward to talk about CSE. Others believed there was wholesale denial of the problem in the Pakistani-heritage community in the same way that other forms of abuse were ignored. Representatives of women's groups were frustrated that interpretations of the Borough's problems with CSE were often based on an assumption that similar abuse did not take place in their own community and therefore concentrated mainly on young white girls.All the senior officers we interviewed were asked whether ethnic considerations influenced their decision making. All were unequivocal that this did not happen. However, several of those involved in the operational management of services reported some attempts to pressurise them into changing their approach to some issues.
The issue of race, regardless of ethnic group, should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is known to be a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised abuse in any local community. There was little evidence of such action being taken in Rotherham in the earlier years. Councillors can play an effective role in this, especially those representing the communities in question, but only if they act as facilitators of communication rather than barriers to it. **One senior officer suggested that some influential Pakistani-heritage councillors in Rotherham had acted as barriers. Several councillors interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion** 

This is an extract from the report. Political correctness did play a role. People in authority were afraid to investigate, identify the ethnic background of the perpetrators and were keen to bury the story as to not ""threaten community cohesion"".

I agree 100% with that. The extra air thing was honestly to try to keep the complaints down, but unnecessary in 2014 when the UK and most of the US is making leaps and bounds towards gay rights and equality.

My main issue is I think people don't understand the film definition of the term ""unnecessary and gratuitous"". Poor writing? Yes. Bad explanation? Definitely.

I think the primary issue here is that while the Jack/Ianto kiss wasn't given some stupid pretense, for some reason, in Western culture (i.e. US and UK), Lesbians are still more sexualized than homosexual males. So Moffatt felt he had to explain away the kiss, instead of just letting it happen naturally. That's just my analysis though.

Yes, other players do make the odd run but generally that's it for us - only two real goal getters at one time. When Markovic went on the impact, though short lived, was three players looking to get into dangerous positions at the same time and it made a difference.

But shrug it off, watch as we continue scoring goals and blocking their attacks, and you'll start to find the hate funny. The other fans spend a lot of time hating us because they can't fathom how we can continue to thrive. Anyway, it's fun in a way to see how we stir up such strong feelings in them.

2. I'd like someone younger to challenge him, but I'm fine with Mignolet. Our back line has been woeful, but he should be fine overall. 

3. God yes. I try look at roles players have been taking, and the guy is abysmal. In the final third, he's absolutely wasteful and defensively he won't challenge or win tackles. He's also wasteful in possession, misplaying passes or bad touches. He's done.

4. Keep both. Skrtel right now knows the PL, and Sakho is still getting used to it. In the future, Sakho-Lovren will be our rocks at the back. Now it's the better defender gets playing time. 

5. No, while it's not a deciding factor, it is importance. It takes one mistake due to footedness to have a goal conceded. It's a comfort thing. ",0,1409317414,null,0,false,0,ck3p9qq,t3_2ewr6d,t1_ck3p9qq,t1_ck3ntd5,null,1427299538,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"  I'm going to do the opposite of what I should, and tell you the truth:  
  
  Let's take a trip back in time...   
  *whoosh*  
  It's the year of our lord 2002 and I just completed my International Baccaleureate from a vaguely prestigious private school that my parents couldn't afford to pay for but I got a full scholarship for, and all of my mates got themselves all worked up about going to various Universities to study very highbrow things up and down the country.  
  I picked English Language and Literature, because I quite liked to read, and I liked the idea of being a teacher. I went to Westminster.  
  Now, from experience, be careful with Language. My first lecture I walked out of after 15 minutes, Phonetics 1.   
  
  *Now, say after me: Teacup*  
  *What am I saying?*   
     
        Teacup  
  
  *Incorrect*  
  
       Fuck this.   
  
  Language is annoying, and I had no choice where it came to picking interesting modules like the history of language, so make sure you know what's available where you want to go. Some of it is dryer than old toast.  
  
  Literature, now that didn't really work out to be what I *wanted* either. There's a lot of bollocks thrown in among the cool stuff, things like Critical Theory and having to read things in accordance with some other 'critical theorist' in mind, who are all largely insane. Look up Julia Kristeva for instance, she was the only one I could stomach.  
  
   I got through the lot of it, and I got my degree, but after that all joy out of reading was leached out of me. I hated the idea of a classroom ever again, and reading anything apart from trashy science fiction no longer appeals. Effectively, my BA in English cost me my love of English. Also, 90% of the people who studied with me were fucking cunts. I don't mean arseholes, but seriously wanky people who all thought they'd be the next James Joyce, but were more than likely intellectual duds. 
  
  I guess what I'm trying to say is be careful, because turning a hobby into a field of study fucking killed me inside, and know what's on the menu before making the leap.",0,1409317550,null,0,false,0,ck3pbdc,t3_2ewstk,t1_ck3pbdc,t3_2ewstk,null,1427299517,8,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,8

true,TheRoyalGanj,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"Of course I can. The Scots have their own parliament and can make many decisions independently. However, there are many factors that pro-independence people fail to take into account. I'll name but a few: new currency, new passports, reapply for the EU, reapply for NATO, reapply for the UN, who gets to be a citizen and who doesn't. Etc.

Edit: At the behest of the commenters below me I have done some more research into the matter.
An independent Scotland would **not**:

* Be guaranteed automatic membership to the EU and would have to reapply by Article 48 or 49

* Be guaranteed membership to the UNSC

* Be guaranteed automatic membership to NATO


Plans have been laid out to grant citizenship to the following:

* British citizens resident in Scotland

* Scottish-born British citizens

* Citizenship by descent through a Scottish parent or grandparent

* Those who have a connection to Scotland or have been living there the past 10 years at some stage

* Certain migrants lawfully living in Scotland via naturalisation

This seems like a lot to deal with, it's easier to declare independence as a less developed nation but in the developed world it creates numerous barriers. If Scotland became independent but wasn't immediately granted EU citizenship then the cost and logistics involved in setting up an official border would be expensive for both Scotland and the UK.

You might argue that there will be an agreement to sort this out while Scotland waits for its membership but no one has any idea how long that will take.

They walked their way to the league. It was a piece of piss. Of course they didn't concede many goals, they were the best team by a country mile. Keep possession, strangle the life out of the game, classic Pep/Barca tactics.  

Real conceded 8 goals in the CL

Dortmund conceded 13

These sex gangs are horrific, full of the worst kinds of criminal, and what creates these criminals must be debated no matter how much of a sensitive topic it may be.

But these kind of evil, fucked up people will always be in the world in one way or another, and it's no good debating the causes of these crimes (cultural or otherwise) if we don't even have a police force or government that cares enough to do anything about it or prevent it, and will even go as far as to deliberately cover it up simply to avoid an awkward conversation.

If they're covering this up, what else are they covering up? Their crime isn't just relevant to these child abuse cases, it reflects upon the entire justice system. In that sense, the cover up is worse than the abuse itself.

&gt;I really don't get the new line of defence being pushed on this page. That it must either be one or the other. That either Pakistan Muslim culture and fears of being labelled racism were factors OR negligence and incompetence were the reason. I think both are important parts of this story.

I live in an area without a significant Pakistani Muslim community, that does however have a significant issue with child sexual exploitation. Committed mainly by white males in their early 20s.

The thing about tackling this that people seem reluctant to talk about is that it is very hard. If you create a generation of girls who have been failed by their families, failed by their communities, their schools and the services that are there to protect them, you create girls who are easy targets for predators. No one is going to listen to them. They are far more likely to be branded chavs or asbos than victims.

Now, in the South Yorkshire example, this was exacerbated by a culture of racism, branding these white girls who appeared out of control as somehow less than human, deserving only contempt and to be used as the men saw fit. Don't think for a second though that this is a uniquely Muslim or Pakistani train of thought. People of any ethnicity can and do take on this inhuman cultural perspective. I really hope this doesn't turn into yet another scapegoat, ignoring the fact that no one has any time to listen to and help these vulnerable young women.

That's not an extreme view. Would you like it if England became part of France and was ultimately ruled by the French president? Would it be racist to want to break away from France and govern ourselves? Does it make us supremacist? 

The answer is no. Representative governments work, and many Scots feel that the UK overall doesn't represent them at all; the political differences are growing larger. When political differences between areas grow too large, you get countries splitting apart, that's how it has always worked. 

Scotland needs devo-max, Westminster can't continue shitting on Scotland and expect no blowback from their policies.

Global period of financial instability towards end of next year, continued loss of confidence in Central Gov model across Europe. Will lead to lengthy period of private sector growth in which the UK looks to have the best growth story across the developed world. 

Infrastructural investors will pile in because of the underdeveloped nature of our regions (respectfully), the access to capital in the City, protection by our world leading judiciary, and external factors like the 10% one off back account tax in the EU, cash exodus from China, US/NSA making US and US businesses and projects internationally unattractive.

&gt;__Avraham ""Avram"" Grant__ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): אברהם ""אברם"" גרנט‎; born __Avraham Granat__  on 6 February 1955) is an [Israeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) football [manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(football\)). Grant has spent the majority of his career coaching and managing in Israel, winning a number of national league and cup victories with different teams, and also managing the [Israeli national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_national_football_team) for four years.

&gt;Grant moved to England in 2006 to become Technical Director of [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C.) before being appointed [Director of football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_football) at [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) in July 2007. Two months later, in September 2007, following the departure of [José Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho), Grant was appointed manager of [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.). Despite steering the team into the [Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) final, the [League Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup) final and contesting the Premier League title to the last day, his contract was terminated at the end of the season. 

&gt;Grant returned to [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C.) as [Director of football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_football) in October 2009, and was made manager the following month.  After the club's relegation to the [Football League Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship) Grant resigned  and, on 3 June 2010, was appointed as manager of [West Ham United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United),  a role he held up until 15 May 2011, when he was sacked after the club was relegated to the Football League Championship.

&gt;Is Johnson really that bad?

Yes

&gt;Is Skrtel worth keeping in the team or is Sakho the answer?

Yes

&gt;Do us fans overstate the importance of what foot a centre back is? Can two left sided centre backs play together?

According to a coach i saw post on here it doesn't matter. But there's obviously a reason for nobody playing two lefties

First problem, it would have cost more than selling up and buying an equivalent sized detached house. Then you need planning permission, which is by no means a given for such a major change.

Then you find you have two of everything you only want one of - front door, kitchen, staircase. So you have a long and expensive redevelopment to basically rip out a load of stuff you have just paid good money for. Plus you have to get all your bills changed to recognise that it is now a single property, which probably isn't going to be a straightforward process.

You end up with a house which will never be quite right, and when you come to sell it, most buyers won't touch it with a barge pole.

Lol. Which is why I don't take it seriously anymore.

 ""There are terrorists planning an attack on the UK""

Well, no shit. If you look back to before the UK tagged a long in the Iraq War, I'm pretty sure the amount of Islamic terror attacks was virtually non-existent. It's inevitable that there will be a reaction to an action so start questioning the action. We turned a blind eye and most probably funded in some way terrorists on the ground in Syria a long with the Americans who refuse to keep out of other peoples business and call it ""humanitarian"".

&gt;
&gt;A dishonest, queasily supremacist appeal to  voters - we  Scots, it implies, are not only different but better than others.

That's nonsense - wanting to increase political autonomy has nothing to do with thinking someone is ""better"" than someone else.

&gt; When George Orwell wrote that nationalism is ""the  worst enemy of peace"", he meant at home as well as abroad.

Some other gems from [Orwell on Nationalism](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat);

* ""Scottish nationalists insist on the superiority of Lowland Scots"".
* ""Celtic nationalism ... has a strong tinge of racialism"".
* It is a ""delusion that Eire, Scotland or even Wales could preserve its independence unaided and owes nothing to British protection"".

While those might have been true to some degree in 1945, none of them have any relevance to independence today.

My reasons for voting yes are:

* I want to remove Trident.
* I want to get rid of an unelected second chamber.
* I want elections to be run on a proportional voting system, not first-past-the-post.
* I would like a written constitution to set some limits on state powers.
* I think a small country is less likely to participate in future US-led conflicts.

Are those ever going to happen within the UK? Are they ever likely to? Is anyone who thinks they would be an improvement ""a nationalist""?

I don't think they will ever happen within the UK, but I have the opportunity to vote for a different system where they will.

That doesn't mean I think Scotland or Scots are somehow superior to anyone else, nor does it even mean I support the SNP (I have never voted for them, and am unlikely to), it simply means I have the choice to vote for something different other than the UK.

First question about UCL draw.  
""Great that LFC are back in their rightful place... Two clubs that are very special - 15 wins between them. Chance for us to play the current champions. Brilliant for our supporters. Felt good yesterday. Great for everyone connected to the club.""  
  
How's Mario?  
""He's settled in fine. Excellent in training and his focus is on his football.""  
  
What're you expecting against Spurs?  
""Good wins last season but were tough games. Our pressing and organisation was at a high level but it will be a hard game and we expect that.""  
  
Fitness concerns?  
""Moreno's twisted his ankle but is recovering well. GJ has a thigh problem and we'll see over the next 48h. Group has been brilliant in training.""  
  
Need to bounce bank after City loss?  
""Strange feeling that night as we're not used to losing, not to sound arrogant. Disappointed not to get something from the game. Flat feeling coming off the field but a lot of positives from the game and we'll retain the positivity over the last 2 years. ""Analysed the game last week and it was a good performance. Needed more cutting edge up front.""  
  
Effect on post-UCL league fixtures?  
""We'll analyse that. It's the whole reason we grew the squad this summer. We've had to add numbers to the very small squad. We need them for the tough months in Oct, Nov, December.""  
  
Balotelli to replace Luis Suarez's goals?  
""He's a member of the team. He's top quality. Class act. Wonderful football qualities. He can play with DS, he can play on his own up front, off to the side. His focus is football. He's moving to Merseyside.""  
  
Harnessing fans' excitement to see MB?  
""It's not the MB Show - we're a team and it's a team game.""  
  
Players to leave?  
""Probably more out than in. Every player here knows their situation. Game time will be very limited for those that stay.""  
  
What happened to Spurs will happen to LFC?  
""Different circumstances. They had their reasons for bringing in their players. We were low on numbers and quality in depth. It's something we had to do regardless of LS' departure. Quality in training is up. Youth brings that energy. We've brought players in who can affect the team now. They're going to be here for a number of years. We'll see how they can help.""  
  
Pochettino?  
""Nice guy, loves his football. They've had a good start but they know this is a different game.""  
  
International break?  
""Doesn't bother me. Can't control it so don't worry about it. Difficult as you're trying to get into your rhythm but you hope to go into it with a positive performance.""  
  
Flanno's contract?  
""He's had a tough time with injuries. He's a young kid and I want him to be an important part of the squad. He's recovering well and we want to reward him with a new deal.""  
  
Lallana's fitness?  
""He'll be in the squad for sure. He's short of match fitness but he's been exceptional in training.""  
  
Enrique?  
""Hasn't had a lot of game time but has been training for a week.""

true,Shuhnaynay,flair5,,"Hey. This comes up a lot, so no worries (should probably make a sidebar thread about it.)

Technically, you do not need a membership to buy PL tickets. In practice, you generally do. A membership gets you (amongst other things) ticket priority, the ability to collect loyalty points (which go towards applications for away games) and, for Bronze members, a spot on the infamous Season Ticket waiting list. 

[Here is the list of ticket on-sale dates.](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/tickets/ticket-on-sale-dates/) You'll notice the four membership brackets. If you're a Bronze member you get that extra day to get tickets, if a Lilywhite member you get 9 days' priority, and if there are tickets left you get them on general sale. As a general rule of thumb (referring to [the categorisation of matches here](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/tickets/ticket-prices/)) almost all Category C games, some Category B games and no Category A games will go to General Sale. Wanna watch the NLD? Get a membership. European games (especially group stages) won't sell out so you won't need a membership. 

You'll also notice in the on-sale dates that there is a guest sale day. If you want to get two tickets together, you'd have to get them on that day through your membership. A word of warning, Category A games might not make it that far. 

Season ticket? Unless you're gonna be going to games for the next decade, I wouldn't worry about getting a season ticket. Members are on a waiting list, and when someone gives up their ST, it goes to the person with the next most loyalty points. There are more people on the season ticket waiting list than there are seats at WHL. 

How the system works, at 9:30am on the relevant on-sale date either go on the website or call the ticket office, give your membership login (you'll get a Client Ref Number if you don't get a membership), sit in a queue of people and then get your tickets. 

Hope that helps. ",0,1409320126,null,0,false,0,ck3q9yp,t3_2ewyvk,t1_ck3q9yp,t3_2ewyvk,null,1427299069,24,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,24

The answer is hard for many people to accept, but it does seem to be yes. There are many reasons for this, but in part it is because of Pakistani culture being imported from Pakistan, and then incubated inside of isolated Pakistani communities in the UK which do not integrate, and so pass these cultural ideas along the generations. 

You mention that there is a significant issue with sex abuse by white men in your community, but it is very unlikely that it is wider British culture that is to blame for their actions isn't it? What is it about British culture that encourages that behaviour? There is plenty that discourages that behaviour. 

The likelihood is that there is a more localised reason for the way they act, in the same way that the the reason these Pakistani men acted in  the way that they did was localised to their community. 

In almost all cases like this it is the environment that the perpetrator is brought up in, or surrounded by that leads to their actions, either by encouraging it, or doing nothing to discourage it. Whether it be the culture of being a priest within the catholic church, the culture within television in the 70s that said that stars could get away with doing whatever they wanted, or being brought up in a community which has a culture that says that women are the property of men, and should do as they are told.

Obviously the most sophomoric thing in this piece is the title, because as long as it's bringing people joy, I wouldn't wish away even the Twilight Franchise. (Although I'd hope that people talk seriously about the domestic violence implications and temper their viewing with that). 

As for his particular grievences against Doctor Who....

1) Too many people like it, so he was forced to view it.

Just like the title, if everyone else is having fun on something you consider braindead, that shouldn't have any implications for him.

2) Good science fiction has good boundaries.

This can be seen as his largest complaint against Doctor Who, which he iterates in different forms throughout the video. It is, of course, a really narrow view of what Science Fiction should be and, as if used as a rubric for ""good"" science fiction, incredibly damaging to the genre. I think of it as the Star Wars vs. Star Trek dychotomy: Star Trek gives you solid rules and complex worldbuilding, whereas Star Wars just says ""science is magic"" and gives you a good adventure. Both can and should exist! One subgenre is for fanatics, and one is for casual viewers, who don't want to research the rules of the piece of fiction, and therefore cannot reap any of the benefits of a cohesive and complex set of laws. 

3) ""You set all of the rules but you refuse to follow them.""   

His two examples are appearances of the Time Lords and the Daleks throughought the series, when both were promised to be dead. But really? It's a basic gimick to promise some big bad thing is dead and then bring it back against all possibilities. It mystifies and lends gravitas to the big bad. There's a foolproof killing curse in Harry Potter, except Harry lives through it, which makes us feel like Harry is special. Voldemort is absolutely dead, but then he comes back, which makes him seem scary. Does it even count as breaking rules if humans think something is impossible before it happens?

4) Characters die and come back when it's convenient to the plot.

This is a valid criticism. However, I think that Doctor Who, since it is a show that caters to ""casuals"" and not hard core Scifi fans, is really meant to be viewed as self-contained episodes or two-episode units with a few threads linking them to a bigger mystery. As such, loss is only explored within the context of one episode, and then different episodes explore regaining that loss or living with it, admittedly at the whim of the authors. Remember in the Christmas special when the doctor said, ""why should they be happy now when they're just going to be sad later?"" and that the answer was ""because they're going to be sad later?"" The show is meant to display the lives of people, so we see them lose other people and find people. The fact that it's about time travel makes these events occur out of order, so when someone feels sad, they are only sad for this episode. This is of course admitting that we only get snapshots of people's lives told in the wrong order, which is antithetical to character arcs and development. If he said the characters do not grow and develop in believable ways because they lose and gain people at random, that would be an even more valid complaint than ""wtf I wanted Rory to always be dead.""

5) The Tardis can translate alien languages except when it feels like it.

How dare they create a diegetic explanation for a science fiction trope that every other science fiction timidly sidesteps (save a few like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and a little novel I wrote hehehe)? Seriously, if anyone thinks Doctor Who is not ""good"" science fiction and would compare it to anything that has aliens or monsters that can communicate with each other, or use English, please recuse yourself. 

6) Doctor Who has all of the ingredients to a good show without putting them together correctly. 

Graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows all taste fine on their own.

6) You have no continuity.

But what is he expecting from Doctor Who? Continuity means adherence to past rules as well as future rules. Sticking with every plot point mentioned in the old series would be fruitless, silly, impossible, and unrewarding for 99% of the audience who doesn't have the time to comb through decades of what are admittedly difficult to watch episodes. So does he want a promise for continuity post-2005? 

The experiment of Doctor Who is to take the idea that time could be re-written with time travel (non-Novikovian time travel) and taking that idea to the extreme. 

Finally, the idea that a relationship is based on the future, not the present, is really unhealthy, in my experience.

Cool, you linked me to some obscure website. My point was, what is the main source of that figure? 

&gt;I speak as if I am not someone who doesn't understand basic negotiations. 

Actually that's exactly how you come across. His agent has no basis to demand a severance from the club when he wants to join Milan. A severance is required when one party demands termination of the contract while the other refuses, i.e. if the club wants to terminate his contract when Torres wants to stay, they'd have to pay him the money which was originally designated to him in his contract. If he wants to leave, which he does, Chelsea have no obligation to pay him, especially since it would defeat the purpose of the transfer.

I think that the reason race is brought to the forefront in this case is that, while it was not the only issue, it was an important one, and it is common in society and the media today to downplay what many might call the more right wing issues. 

In previous similar cases the issue of race was always downplayed, and we were told that these things happen in all communities and it had nothing to do with culture. But now we have as close to concrete proof as we will get that culture HAS played a part, and people are starting to understand that it is right to investigate issues like culture alongside everything else, that its not racist to be concerned about it.

Firstly it's a combination of jealousy that you have unlimited wealth and frustration that you have been able to use it to take a short cut to the very top of the game. Other clubs that where in a similar situation to you 15 years ago are more or less in the same spots as they try to make clever signings to improve their club, however even if these clubs make these clever signings, as soon as they perform well they are lost to clubs such as Chelsea, Madrid or City. In our case we have made great signings such as Modric, Bale, Carrick and Berbatov in the last 10 years, and we lost them all to clubs who have been gifted untold wealth by billionaire owners. I have no doubt that we will also loose Eriksen and Lamela once they perform at their full potential. 
Modern Chelsea fans can have little idea of how frustrating this can be, to be on the cusp of breaching the Champions League places and to be totally robbed of your star players. In the one year that you slipped up in the league you spent an unbelievable amount of money (Compared to other teams relative wealth) on Hazard, Oscar, Marin and Azpilicueta. 

Chelsea also appear to be very lucky, now all teams have their fair share of luck, both good and bad, so this point is probably a little unfair, but Chelsea has a history of winning games, and as result cups in the absolute jammiest of ways. Examples being 90th minute equalisers and then winning on penalties or going to 10 men against Barcelona and still managing to win somehow. Also the one year you didn't automatically qualify for the Champions League you guys won it. That one in particular hurt me personally. 

Most non-Chelsea fans would also argue that a lot of your players are very dislikable, especially Cole and Terry, with Terry being a suspected racist and Cole shooting a work experience lad and cheating on his wife. Many Chelsea players have a history of diving, all though every club has this problem. 

Many if these points do not only apply to Chelsea however, all clubs dislike all clubs bigger than them, especially those with large resources and Champions League football, with a trophy cabinet bigger than most clubs stands. I think from the outside looking in Chelsea, City, Madrid etc. suffer an equal amount of 'hate' from other fan groups, however from the perspective of any one of these clubs it appears there is more directed at them. 

In summary; Chelsea appear lucky, have unlimited resources which they spend without remorse (spending £469,559,000 in the last 5 years), have somewhat dislikable players in senior roles at the club, and have relentless success.

Except that's money he's trying to get his hands on for a period of time where he'd no longer *be* a Chelsea player. Generally, players renegotiate new terms with their new teams. But Torres wants to play AND wants the wages we contracted with him for. I won't apologize for the club because they clearly overpaid, but it's pretty audacious to turn to the club you've underperformed for across the board and say ""yes, I'm getting a new deal from the new club that is doing poorly enough that I'll actually play for them, but I still want you to make whole the rest of my contract that becomes completely defunct as soon as I sign with them.""

Fans aren't only fans of clubs; they also care qbout the players individually, and Torres comes off as a money-grubbing dick, trying to cash in on money he doesn't deserve (even if he'd be contractually entitled to it, should he stay with Chelsea for the remaining two seasons).",0,1409324498,null,0,false,0,ck3s7w1,t3_2ex2sn,t1_ck3s7w1,t1_ck3r1g6,null,1427298091,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Galerath,null,null,"Well it is pertinent because your question is at what point should we stop dividing up a country? I.e. why shouldn't Glasgow become a city state?

The way I understood that question is that you're asking at what point of dividing up the land do we reach absurdity? When does our endevour become silly and fail to produce meaningful states? So bound up in that is a boundry question, i.e. the smallest possible sensible division of the peoples on our Island. And in boundry issues such as this, the Sorites Paradox always takes hold. 

To answer your point: Well the UK covers more than geographic proximity doesn't it? For one thing, there are plenty of littler islands also counted under the UK flag. And even bits of the next biggest Island in the archipelago, i.e. Northern Ireland. Why should the UK stop where it is? Applying your argument, we still want to coexist peacefully on this small island chain, so why does Ireland want to be independent? 

Then, why stop at this archipelago? I mean, France is right next door... 

See what I mean about the Sorites Paradox? We can keep making the circle of proximity bigger and bigger, pushing out the supposed natural borders of the UK until it encompasses the entire planet (And not for the first time... :P).

So to provide something resembling an answer but it'll by no means be a comprehensive one because we have this big looming paradox and issues of vagueness in the background. But here goes: The real question you're asking is why does the civic nationalist think that Scotland rather than say Glasgow should be independent when Scotland and the Scottish people are part of the UK and the British people in the same way that Glaswegians are part of the Scottish people? 

Historically and culturally the Scots are a distinct group of people, separate enough from the English to still, after all these centuries identify as Scottish rather than British or English. Although the Scottish *people* are part of the British *people* they are strongly culturally distinct. Strongly enough to warrant being considered a separate people that have a democratic right to choose their own government. 

My own position has morphed. I actually started out a couple of years ago as a federalist. I supported Scottish independence is a second best option - freedom from the insular, elitist, and self serving rule of Westminster. But funnily enough, having spent time in England, I've moved to the latter position. I think that culturally, the Scots are, in general, very different from the English to the point that it's a wonder we've managed to rub along for all this time. I think it's best for both of us culturally and politically (economically it's a mixed bag) if we go our separate ways at this point. 

If Glaswegians considered themselves culturally distinct enough from rScotland to hold an independence referendum I'd support their right to do so. 

Still, I hope you can see where the Sorites Paradox can start leaking in again. If we deny the cultural distinction between Scotland and rUK (as I have between Glasgow and rScotland), we can also attack the UK for being independent from Europe, after all we're predominantly secular white european and neoliberal, so why do us Brits feel like we should have an independent state?

Not at all. It's far more a statement about the difficulty of achieving change within the UK.

""Several councillors interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion. To some extent this concern was valid, with the apparent targeting of the town by groups such as the English Defence League.

He was one of the elected members who said they thought the criminal convictions in 2010 were 'a one-off, isolated case', and not an example of a more deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls.

Cars are in the process of being replaced by hover-skiffs, heli-barges and bungee-copters (one-man quad-copters with harness hanging below).

Not really, Scotland isn't a country other than historical precedent. The United Kingdom is the country for which Scotland is a part of, Scotland isn't recognized as a ""country"" in an official sense by any international organisation. 

That United Kingdom doesn't have a special right to exist forever, nor does Scotland. There's no particular reason why Scotland should exist as  an entity longer than the United Kingdom any more than there is any particular reason why the Highlands and Lowlands should be part of one nation.

true,Matt-SW,null,null,"&gt; Not a fixation, just that speeding is the easiest thing to detect and enforce.

No, it is a fixation. It's a fixation for a number of reasons. Without sounding like a broken record, it's about the money and the fact that we've had ingrained into us over the years that by driving at or below some arbitrary number, we're being safer.

You can't measure safe driving in miles per hour. You can't measure safe *speed* in miles per hour.

I'll dig out the latest figures if I get a chance, but it's something like 55% of drivers exceed the speed limit on 70mph roads and in 30mph areas. Setting an appropriate speed, and reducing it when necessary is the essence of safe driving, not just abiding some arbitrary number set over half a century ago. Contrary to popular belief, most drivers are pretty damn good at setting a responsible, safe speed and then reducing that as necessary when the risk of an obstruction increases.

If you had no speedo in your car, do you think you could get in and drive safely? If your answer is no, then you shouldn't be on the road, but if your answer is yes, what does that tell you about that little dial on your dashboard flicking up and down? 

Any speed above 30mph is potentially quite deadly. If we are to trust drivers to mitigate their deadly speed to avoid accidents, the actual number of the speedometer is of little relevance. 

If we put more emphasis on awareness of a safe speed and better awareness of obstructions, we'd be doing a much better job at road safety than just setting a number everyone has to follow.

**Edit:** Sorry for the rant, but I've spent hundreds of hours researching general causation of accidents on our roads and our huge fixation on this one tiny part of it irritates me to no end.",0,1409325730,null,0,1409326044,0,ck3stxd,t3_2ev25e,t1_ck3stxd,t1_ck3s09h,null,1427297805,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,xljj42,null,null,"You raise really good counter points to everything mentioned in the video, but I think the video is a good critique on the show as a whole. It raises points that I have seen many people raise. The show has its inconsistencies and is not always top notch in its presentation of itself, but for 99% of the viewers what they see is more than enough to keep them coming back to it.

1.  I think the 'too many people like it so he was forced to watch it' was added more for comic or satirical value than actual truth of fact. The Doctor Who fandom is exceptionally large and very vocal in its love for the show. Especially on places like Tumblr.

2. I think the complaint on boundaries has more to do with the consistency of the show and he uses a good example. The werewolves in Victorian England would have been fine on their own, but the ninja-Buddhist monks are really out of place even for a casual, science=magic viewer.

3. Properly executing the gimmick of the 'we think they're dead, but they're not really' trope is great. Playing with people's expectations can make for good, dramatic television, but Doctor Who did not do so well with the Daleks in that regard and really mistreated the Master in that regard on his second appearance. The first appearance of the Dalek in ""Dalek"" was really well done. It adds so much drama to the story and you kind of see that the Doctor is capable of making mistakes and that he's not necessarily a good person at all times. But then you had a bit of a Dalek overload. What could have been a strong mystery or hook about why they survived the time war turned into a joke. Same thing with Saxon and the Master. Beautifully done and played up, but the second coming with the x-ray look and everything else was kind of... eh.

4. Killing and bringing back people the way Who does just makes it feel like there is nothing to lose in the series. They end up having to invent reasons why the Doctor simply cannot go back in time and fetch them. Rory and Amy for instance. They cannot permanently kill off a companion, so instead they send them back in time and make it so that the Doctor can not fetch them for fear of destroying the world. Kind of silly when the angels are well known for killing their prey as well as sending them back. Watching Doctor Who is kind of like reading a comic book. They can 'kill' Captain America all they want, but I know that they'll bring him back eventually.

5. I agree.

6. I agree.

7. I agree that having a strong continuity is tough in a show built on time travel. Word of God is that there is no continuity for the show, so its pretty much a moot point anyway.

Nope. It's set by [JTAC](https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/about-us/who-we-are/organisation/joint-terrorism-analysis-centre.html).

Who are JTAC? 

&gt;JTAC operates as a self-standing organisation comprised of **representatives from sixteen government departments and agencies.** It forms a key element of the National Intelligence Machinery.

&gt;The Head of JTAC is accountable to the Director General of the Security Service, who in turn reports to the Government's Joint Intelligence Committee on JTAC's activities. **An Oversight Board, chaired by the Cabinet Office**, ensures that JTAC meets customer requirements by monitoring the effectiveness of JTAC's systems for engaging with customer departments.

So the Terror Threat level is set by a committee run by government departments and is overseen by the highest level of government bureaucracy (the Cabinet Office). It is therefore *not* set independently by MI5/MI6.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Not really, Scotland isn't a country other than historical precedent. The United Kingdom is the country for which Scotland is a part of, Scotland isn't recognized as a ""country"" in an official sense by any internal organisation.

I assume you meant international rather than internal, but this is essentially why we have a different point of view.

If you see Scotland as a region of the UK, like Yorkshire, then your view on what independence means (or even why it makes sense) are going to be quite different than if you see Scotland as a country within a voluntary union.

That Scotland or England aren't recognised individually by the EU or NATO or the UN doesn't really mean much in terms of ""are these things countries?"" for people within the UK. The UK is the simply the joint face of those two countries, in a similar way to the EU is the joint face of many European countries during WTO talks.

Many more people feel their identity is ""Scottish only"" or ""English only"" (about 60% in both countries, going by the last census) than ""British"".

&gt; Great so you voting to end a 300-year old union because of actions in the last couple of decades? Makes sense.

I don't think it's plausible to wait until you've had had an equal number of ""bad years"" to ""good years"" before you say ""you know what, it's been 601 years and we've had 300 good and 301 bad so let's go"".

true,Vorsa,null,null,"* I like a wide array of musical genres (though I don't like pop that much.) from EDM to Rural stuff.

There's tonnes of this all over the UK. You can find details of festivals, events and the like months before you travel and pick what you fancy. There are also plenty of lesser known bands playing all sorts of venues, from pubs to clubs, across the UK most weekends. 

For larger events, I'd suggest planning them before you travel (as they can be expensive) then use Facebook/Google to find more local events wherever you are. 

* Arts, Buildings and Culture amaze me as well

Any city has all of this, but London is absolutely filled with it. Natural History Museum, Trafalgar Square, Greenwich, Big Ben, The Eye, London Dungeon, Royal Albert Hall, St Paul's Cathedral and many more. 

One of the best things you can do is just wonder around. Our Cities are all pretty centralised so you'll find a whole bunch of things to see and do just walking around and looking at tourist pamphlets. 

* Urban/Crowded spaces turn me on

Same as above really. Any famous shopping areas (Bullring in Birmingham, Bond Street in London), Drinking areas (Swan Street in Swansea, St Mary's St in Cardiff) are bustling throughout the day and evening, but, again, just wondering around will take you to these crowded places. 

* Beer.

Welcome to the UK. Your closest pub is probably around the corner. 

We have the typical stuff, your spirits, lagers and bitters, but we have a whole host of evenings around beer, like Ale Weeks and the like. Again, it's a case of get somewhere and explore what's available. 

* Pubbing before sundown

Go to any coastal area/town/city and you'll find pubs along the coast. It's part of our culture really.

* Parks and outdoors

Wales. Specifically Mid and South Wales. 

I've seen a lot of suggestions about North Wales, but it's a dump. I grew up in Mid Wales (near Aberystwyth) and the towns in the north (any more north than Porthmadog) are just not worth the visit. 

Aberystwyth, Aberaeron, New Quay, Brecon, Carmarthen, Llangollen, Tenby, Fishguard and Barmouth are great destinations for a couple of days exploring, hiking and seeing the culture, but you won't get much more than a couple of days enjoyment out of each. 

Many smaller places have your niche interests covered (such as Aberdovey for Golf, Betws-y-Coed for caving or Blaenau Ffestiniog if you want to conduct a study on inbreeding and the effects of vitamin D deficiency), so make sure you look them up if you have any. 

South Wales has some fantastic, more substantial, places to visit in Swansea and Cardiff (I'd suggest avoiding Newport and Port Talbot). They're a short commute distance to the outdoors, they have amazing nightlife and genuinely great people (Cardiff more so than Swansea..), Shopping, they're coastal (although, you want Barry for a beach visit if in Cardiff), entertainment in several indoor arena's and stadiums, just generally great places to visit.

Ramires's goal was much more important against Barca, and he did fuck all against Bayern besides mope about not taking a penalty (and winning a corner but I don't recognize that as an achievement). And then next year in the group stages of the Champion's League he disappeared again.

Immediately on scanning, found all the channels again, and the picture is perfect and i don't have to tiptoe round the room trying not to upset the signal. Signal is now so strong, the boost ruins it again by overpowering.

Should have remembered this, when the signal was switched off in our area, at work I was visiting a girl in a hostel, ended up trying to help her get any signal on her tv. I ended up taping an old loop aerial to her ceiling for a week to get any signal. Visited day after switch over, took the aerial down to on top of tv, rescanned, all channels and perfect reception.

true,OllieSimmonds,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt; If you see Scotland as a region of the UK, like Yorkshire, then your view on what independence means (or even why it makes sense) are going to be quite different than if you see Scotland as a country within a voluntary union.

I suppose I do, but I also see the counties of England, and the counties of Scotland as voluntary unions, I don't see how there's any particular difference between a voluntary union between two groups of counties. 

&gt; That Scotland or England aren't recognised individually by the EU or NATO or the UN doesn't really mean much in terms of ""are these things countries?"" for people within the UK. The UK is the simply the joint face of those two countries, in a similar way to the EU is the joint face of many European countries during WTO talks.

I don't think that's a fair comparison because the EU doesn't claim to be a nation with its own sovereignty, otherwise Scotland is just the combined face of its cities/shires etc. My argument is that there is confusion with the word country, because it is implies independent sovereignty. Scotland is not currently a country any more than the individual states of the US or Australia are countries, the only difference in the terminology is that there is historical precedent in Scotland being a country.

&gt; I don't think it's plausible to wait until you've had had an equal number of ""bad years"" to ""good years"" before you say ""you know what, it's been 601 years and we've had 300 good and 301 bad so let's go"".

That is of course true, but the idea that decisions of perhaps the next 300 years when the face of the earth will be undoubtedly unrecognisable to us today can be made based on foreign relations of the last 20 years or so is pretty silly.

&gt;I'm not the only one who took the reported results to mean that among the wealthy EU countries, 9/10 of the poorest regions are in the UK.

So I agree people like you who dug a little deeper would have realised that instead of ""northern countries"" like the title suggested, it was actually a pick of the 'wealthiest' countries in the EU.
One thing i'd like to point out is this is already very wrong. Many people including this subreddit, look at the title and decide their opinions there and upvote/downvote and comment accordingly. Many I presume do not actually dig a little deeper. There are classic example/experiment done to show that this is the case, (please google I cannot link it apparantly)

Secondly, the definition of wealthy and how it is measured is much debated. I know you can just google the definition but actually doing data research is a whole other issue. I touched on this about how GDP is measured and how GDP per Capita isn't really a good indication of wealth or income or any kind of well being. This is clear misrepresentation of data. The original report wasn't intended for this and cannot be used to measure wealth in anyway. They even state that it shouldn't be very clearly in their website.

&gt;I don't think it has. I also wasn't surprised to see that London, by any measure, is rich in comparison to most other UK areas

I know what you mean, but some people who aren't as acute may take the finding as another London hating theme. They will think that 'London is like another country' or 'We should just separate London and it'll be good for all of us.' These comments frequently gets upvoted very much in this subreddit and most do not realise that these kinds of inequality or wealth reports are extremely distorted. You cannot and I repeat CANNOT use these kinds of figures to measure well being or wealth or how 'rich' a region is. Only thing you can take from this is that London is a lot more developed than other regions, not that the average Londoner is ~~3-5~~ 4-5 times better off than the others. This simply cannot be true. Other factors like costs needs to be taken into account.

Or in other words no evidence that things were ignored because of race. 

Identifying any cultural root in the motivation of the abusers wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference in the short term when children were not being protected because the police, for example, viewed the them as ""undesirables"" not worthy of that projection and not because they were ignoring the cases due to issues of race, which again there was no evidence of. 

Long term it would have to be looked at and tackled if appropriate in order to make children safer but that is predicated on the idea that anyone wanted to protect them in the first place and that clearly wasn't the case... the failure here is a symptom of a wider problem of the people involved not giving a fuck not it's cause.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I don't think that's a fair comparison because the EU doesn't claim to be a nation with its own sovereignty, otherwise Scotland is just the combined face of its cities/shires etc. My argument is that there is confusion with the word country, because it is implies independent sovereignty. Scotland is not currently a country any more than the individual states of the US or Australia are countries, the only difference in the terminology is that there is historical precedent in Scotland being a country.

The UK is something of an unusual union. While the vast majority of sovereignty was combined it is still explicitly ""a country of countries"" rather than a single entity.

If Scotland hadn't retained its own legal system, educational system, general registrar, etc, then the situation would be much more similar to that of states within the US or Australia.

But on a spectrum of US states to EU members, the countries within the UK are somewhere within the middle. Internationally they act as a single entity, domestically they're not. The education you receive, the crimes you can be charged with, and your relationship to the state all vary depending on which country you're in.

&gt; That is of course true, but the idea that decisions of perhaps the next 300 years when the face of the earth will be undoubtedly unrecognisable to us today can be made based on foreign relations of the last 20 years or so is pretty silly.

If neither 20 years nor 200 years are appropriate ways to make a decision, I'm not sure what timescale is. We're only alive for a finite period, and our choices are made based on on our own experiences and our feelings about the future (some of which comes from experience, some of which comes from looking at history).

There's a common argument that ""voting Yes will get rid of the Conservatives forever!"". I think that's a reaction to short term events (Thatcher onwards), and I think that's a case of mistaken thinking.

Taking the Conservatives as a somewhat ironic example, their share of the vote vs the power they received is a good example of what's motivating me:

* Under FPTP, 17% of the Scottish vote resulted in a single Conservative MP in the 2010 General Election (2% of Scottish MPs).
* Under AMS, 14% of the vote resulted in 15 Conservative MSPs in the 2011 Holyrood Election (12% of MSPs).

A decent chunk of Scotland still votes Conservative, yet they have very little representation at Westminster. They have considerably more at Holyrood, in line with the number of people who voted for them.

Whether you support the Conservatives or not, the fact that I can choose - right now - between a voting system that ensures parties are represented by their votes vs one that always degenerates into a two-party system is what's motivating me.

Yes, in theory, the UK might drop FPTP eventually. But in practice, I can vote for something else in a couple of weeks.",0,1409328106,null,0,false,0,ck3u21u,t3_2ewmvj,t1_ck3u21u,t1_ck3tilz,null,1427297234,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I just feel like Townsend out, Scheniderlin in. Another CM out to accommodate Morgan. Academy prospect promoted (AML) for depth and a REAL quality player to compliment Eriksen and Lamela would be amazing bought in. Chadli has been solid, and he's great depth. Poch won't do Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela (even though our av positions are so narrow Chadli was basically a AMC), but I'm getting a boner just thinking about the amount of creativity in those 3 with a solid 2 behind them.

I just feel that would be the final piece of the puzzle. Vorm/Lloris/Brad, great depth at LB, RB and CB now with a good balance of Fazio/Dier/Kaboul &amp; Vlad/Vertonghen. Bentaleb, Schneiderlin &amp; Capoue so far we know would be perfect as CM's in the system. Eriksen - Lamela are nailed on starters - I feel the AML is our weakest position and the wings in general are, especially if the ''Holtby back to Germany'' rumours are to be believed as if Eriksen gets burnt out and Lamela plays AMC, who plays AMR? Lennon &amp; Townsend just aren't good enough imo, and I'd rather use Townsend as leverage for the possible Schneiderlin deal than keep him as a squad player.

true,btharveyku08,null,null,"Well first off, he'd be heading to Milan ;), but I think the sticking point for Chelsea is that it was already a good deal for Torres because he was going to be able to *play* at Milan. But he still apparently thought little enough of his time at Chelsea and the money they've already paid him (and how much he didn't live up to his billing) to turn around and then demand the remainder of whatever Milan doesn't want to pay him. 

The more he takes from Chelsea beyond thanking the club for its time and all parties moving on, the more it sounds like a last-minute shakedown on the way out of town. Push them enough, and he can spend the next two years with the youth squad.

I'm not saying the club needs to be bitter about parting ways, not at all, but this is a somewhat sour way for Torres to proceed here. He's clearly not worth that much money or even a fraction of it (even if split between the two clubs) based on the last three seasons, but here we are. Chelsea doesn't need to do Torres any more favors, and if they do, it's because they finally just want to forget good business for long enough to just wash their hands of him.

In short, while you're right that it's still better for the club competitively and monetarily to not have to pay Torres a full 16M over the next two seasons, I just think that he's souring the deal some by squeezing more out, money that we would've liked to re-purpose into the replacement that might even *score* once every two games or so.

true,yhkim1219,null,null,"&gt; How valid is the use of PPS to compare income between regions?

So PPS is a standardised currency based on the PPP which stands for Purchasing Power Parity. What this basically is, Eurostat looks at a basket of goods and services (similar to that of the basket of goods used to measure the CPI), and measures how much it costs to buy that good with the country's currency. Then they compare that with other countries to create the PPS which is basically an artificial exchange rate created to compare countries. 

The famous example of this is of course the Big Mac Index (have a google, very fun to look at)

This method is probably the best method economists have to compare countries without the bias, volatility and manipulation that comes with the exchange rates.

However there are still draw backs to this and economists are trying really hard to try and improve it. For example, the quality of goods you buy in one region isn't necessarily going to be the same with other regions. I mean even for the Big Mac Index, Big Macs aren't the same everywhere. In the US it's almost twice as big.

Another is that it doesn't necessarily 100% truly reflects the purchasing power of income within regions since there are so many factors that affect prices, from transport costs, taxes, subsidies, price discrimination and lots more. 

This is why I really really want to stress that GDP per Capita isn't Income. It can never be interchangeable (I don't know why it is taught or perceived that way), it cannot be used for any other conclusion other than: This area has more economic activity, which basically means: There are more successful businesses within this area, Or maybe even: This area is more developed.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"&gt;However, there also clear disadvantages and it's certainly not as clear cut as the SNP make out.

I think when it comes out of the SNP's mouth, it is purely to garner votes. For whatever reason, more Yes voters want currency union than don't. Which from an economic perspective, seems really strange. To complicate it further, the Unionist parties have told them where to go, for what I imagine is, to support the No campaign, despite the actual concept being of benefit to rUK (a hilariously underhanded way to give a better negotiation position).

I imagine these currency unionists want it to keep Scotland stable, and to prevent capital and business flight while maintaining stability. A new floating currency in a new country would go haywire pretty quick. It has to be a gradual thing, and honestly, just using it unilaterally isn't the worst idea in this scenario. Obviously the best would be Monetary Union... but MU without Political Union is very dangerous - look at the smaller Eurozone members.

If the SNP had wanted a separate currency, I have a small feeling that the Unionist camp would offer currency union to try and persuade some more people to vote No. All though, if the Unionist camp actually gave two shits, they would be listening to the people of Scotland and promising more of what they want to persuade voters, rather than this BT rhetoric which concentrates purely on the status-quo. Say what you want about the SNP, at least they're offering something.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Steven Gerrard lacks something that is very basic to DM/anchors but he has a lot more to offer. Lucas and Allen are full of flaws that people ignore or forget when they aren't playing. For one Lucas fouls a lot, he is as slow as Gerrard, doesn't have the passing range of Gerrard and isn't nearly as productive as Gerrard from set pieces. Allen like Lucas is great at short passes, presses well and protects the ball well, however he has his own set of problems when it comes to the physical side of the game. A big midfielder could bully him and most refs wouldn't have problems letting the play go on, at the base of midfield it's dangerous. Even then he doesn't take set pieces, isn't a leader, doesn't have passing range and so on.


If that isn't enough, then look at Juventus/Italy, Pirlo is a lot worse than Gerrard when it comes to defending, mostly due to the weakness of his body, but he stars for them due to his passing range, ability to keep possession and set pieces. This idea that we need grafters in DM is outdated and will soon disappear, in 2 man midfield a player like Masche or Lucas are awesome, but in 3 man midfield you need box to box players with a deeplying playermaker. The defensive cover should come mostly from the 2 runners next to the ""DM"".

There's quite a big difference between the two. 

For one thing, an independant Scotland within the EU would be a sovereign nation rather than a constituent country within the UK, meaning that the Scottish Government would hold much more decision making power than it does now, e.g. over:

 * Defence

 * Taxation

 * Immigration

 * Foreign Policy

 * International Relations

In addition to the powers it has now. The only power it wouldn't gain that it doesn't presently have under the present SNP plans is control over monetary policy, which many EU nations don't have control over either.

Assaidi? what a fucking Joke. GTFO already. POS. 

Coates? You were simply bought to keep Suarez happy. You did your bit, you are probably not going to be a 1st teamer, like ever. So go to sampadoria already. 

Agger or Toure? Pick one brendo, get rid of the other. Simples. I know you think its nice to have Defensive depth, but not when you buy 2 centerhalfs and don't sell any of the old ones. I'd rather have Agger, and Shift Lovren to the right, so we can rotate 4 awesome CB's and keep them all happy.

I am a Rangers season ticket holder (hey this is just like I imagine Alky Anon will be).

I enjoy going to the games, supporting my club, and I used to enjoy the general banter with other supporters.

Not any more.

I watch Rangers field poor teams against poor opposition, and there is absolutely no banter from other supporters, just abuse. Hey we all gave and took abuse at times, no problem with that. Usually after a fierce game, or some daft transfer or something. It was football related.

This stuff has just about got me turning my back on Scottish football and saying hell mend you. Now of course many of you will say good riddance. 

The financial Armageddon that was predicted when Rangers got bounced to the lower leagues didn't happen. I think it was Mr Doncaster that was saying that anyway, not Rangers. The SPL did go after the SFLs Rangers generated TV money though, and that lead to reforming the league.

If Rangers go to the wall (this time) it will mean free Saturdays for me, and maybe for lot of you as well. Scottish football will lose me as a money paying supporter. I'm not going to suddenly become a Ross County supporter, or an Inverness fan (I live in the highlands these days).  There are better products out there. Instead of a season ticket to Ibrox a couple of trips to the EPL. 
Obviously it wont just be me, it will be tens of thousands of Scottish football fans lost to the game. A game that is already teetering, whether you want to admit it or not. No sponsorship for league or cup, what will the next TV  deal be without Rangers?

This week I've seen Celtic fans wondering why their club isn't good enough to be in the Champions League, and wondering if a season ticket is worth it in the same breath. We all know why. 

Of course Scottish football will continue without Rangers, but if you think the product is bad now...just wait and see.

The Highland league won't be affected, unless its clubs asking to re-apply ;)

I think the main difference here is, Unionists will not shout you down en masse. I even think, and I may be biased here, that /r/unitedkingdom reddit votes a little more objectively. Only a little though, especially as it gets larger.

&gt;you'll tend to seek out a friendlier community, and do little more than lurk on the other one.

And for you to say that as a DM Gerrard is better than Lucas is just crazy. As a DM with the ball at his feet? Yes 100%. But on the defensive end? No shot. Lucas' positioning is by far better than Gerrard. Two goals City scored were direct result of Gerrard and Hendo being out of position, but it lands on Gerrard bc his role for that game was to protect the back four. 

Regardless, I simply do not believe we will be successful with Stevie as our DM throughout the year. He needs a DM with DM intelligence next to him so that those holes in his game don't get exposed. Lucas and him playe poorly the first game so not sure that's the solution. Just my opinion based on these two games.

In defence of Celtic, most of their fans are blaming their board for not re-investing. **Not** because Rangers aren't in the league, but because they recieved substantial amounts from EPL teams for their players and are not seeing that being put back into the team. 

Also genuine question: why are you not boycotting your season ticket now if it's all that bad? From what I understood a lot of Rangers fans have done this, or am I misinformed?

Colin Bell deserved every plaudit.  He was equal parts Yaya Toure and David Silva.  On top of that he is one of the few players from his time who I think was athletic enough that he wouldn't be too off the pace today.  There's the old story about the England camp in Mexico who prepared for the heat by holding a mini Olympics for the players and Bell supposedly won every event.

Paul Lake is one that sadly none of us saw in his prime because his injury took him out at a young age, but he had a *lot* of promise.  Most believe he would have been England captain for a long time had his career not been cut short.  We'll never know, of course, but I believed the hype and think he could have been an England legend.

true,rydleo,null,null,"Might be a long one, so I apologize in advance-

Manquillo- he's 4 months older than McLaughlin.  Why loan in a promising RB 4 months older than the promising RB you already have?

Aspas- was bought to cover as 3rd striker as our previous 3rd choice striker was out on loan.  Now he's himself been loaned while the previous 3rd choice striker is back (for the time being) but has been replaced by Lambert making him 4th choice and decidedly unhappy even though he actually had a pretty good campaign on loan at Sunderland.  

Alberto- Very similar sort of player to a promising youngster we sent on loan to Almeria and a promising we sent out on loan this year in Teixera.  Never given a chance really and I can't see him bothering to come back since he's also been replaced by Lallana.

Ilori- spent about the same amount on him as Soton spent on Lovren, only to never play a game or even have a look in.  Out on loan again as BR appears to prefer Toure to him as backup RCB.

Assaidi- I don't even know where to start with him?  I mean really, why did we buy him exactly?

Markovic- apparently bought for some reason, but I don't know why.  He'll play occasionally and isn't bad or anything, but could not his limited role in the squad have been filled by say Ibe or even Alberto?  Not to mention Lallana.

Sakho- seemingly stuck behind Lovren as second choice LCB.  Brilliant bit of business and if he remains sitting on the bench he will leave, no doubt about it.

The loans- Moses, Sahin, Cisshoko.  All a massive waste of money (over £4M on Sahin alone) and did little to nothing other than in some cases taking time on the pitch away from our own youngsters.

In general, we seem to be acquiring youngsters who then in turn push our current youngsters further down the food chain.  Lots of loans ensue and unhappiness results.  We need a strategy that shows to the young players how they fit into the squad, and when they will be given a chance, otherwise what's the point?  

Aspas is on loan and will likely be returning to us next year.  What's the plan?  Sell him?  Keep him?  Loan him again?   That's more what I mean by strategy- at the moment it seems we throw them out on loan with little thought about what to do with them when they inevitably come back (Borini being a great example).

It is no coincidence that Celtic aren't being challenged for the league and also aren't investing less in the squad.

Rangers fans are no different from any other group of people that have one thing in common, they don't agree on other things. There is no consensus that boycotting season tickets isn't just a faster chute down. In my opinion that's exactly what it has led to.

Aspas - Brought in off the back of two decent seasons at Celta and Borini looks likely to leave, or the plan was to at least let him leave.


Alberto - Agree with this one.


Ilori - He's still only 21, we already have a fair few CBs so keeping him at the club would be a mistake seeing as though he'd struggle massively for game time.


Assaidi - Did have some good moments, looks like we'll make a profit on him if he does ever get sold to Stoke though. 


Markovic - One of the most promising young attacking talents around in a position we needed depth in. He'll do more than occasionally play if he plays half as well and he's able to. 


Sakho - Should probably be playing a long side Lovren and honestly looks like that was the plan.


Loans - Moses and Cissohko were both needed badly for depth, Sahin just didn't work out.



On the young players point, apart from Suso there's no one that most people would say is truly ready to have a larger part in the first team, Ibe might but a season long loan at Derby would do him so much more.

I doubt that we'll see any concessions from Westminster apart from to Middle England, who want the Scottish budget cut to the bone.

&gt;Immigration can't happen with a shared border.

You're assuming that means *reducing immigration*. The point is to keep in the EU (whilst rUk is desperate to get out of it) and keep the immigrants coming because we need them. Scotland has an aging population and the immigrants are young blood. We don't have the same demographic problems as the rest of the UK (partly because the people coming are Polish/Lithuanian/Latvian and they integrate well with the Scots). Scotland in the UK and out of the EU would be a disaster in the medium term. It'd become Retirement Land and little else. 

&gt;Defence would be meaningless due to size/cost.

Exactly. We can stop playing at pretend Empires and shed ourselves of the massive cost burden that is Trident (which former heads of the Armed forces admit is totally pointless) and of maintaining a Blue Water navy. Instead focusing on our own borders (presently almost entirely unguarded by the MoD by the way), and on fulfilling a specialist role in NATO and other alliances.

&gt;The other two aren't serious.

I guess you think the two foreign wars that we've taken part in in the last 15 years are also ""not serious""? That the UK's involvement in extraordinary rendition by the USA is ""not serious""? That the present situation in Ukraine is ""not serious""? That the present situation in Syria is ""not serious""? 

Foreign Policy and International relations are two of the absolute most important functions of a sovereign nation. 

&gt;The question therefore is why is the SNP seeking the destruction of a perfect single market with all those costs, the diversion of thousands of civil servants for a decade or two, a boom for tax advisors and the divertion of billions of pounds of taxes from productive use?

Maybe some things are more important than economic efficiency?

true,heisenberg423,lfc12,,"No apology needed. I'd rather read that than a five word snarky quip that reddit tends to breed. Fair points on all of them as well.

* Manquillo - Was starting to see good playing time for Atletico before his injury. I haven't seen very much of McLaughlin, but from the little I've seen of Manquillo, he has more upside and also has the physical attributes to fit right into the side.

* Aspas - We needed scoring depth, but it became apparent that he did not have the ability to play an auxiliary role and add spark off the bench. Proved to not be versatile enough to contribute on the wing, as neither Suarez of Sturridge was going to be subbed off to make room for him. He needed to be played as a lone striker to succeed, but that was never going to happen with only the league to worry about. Slightly misused, but all together not good enough. 

* Alberto - Not sure about this one. Wish we would have used him off the bench more than Aspas and Moses last season. He's young though, and needs consistent minutes to develop. Coming off the bench for 30 minutes at a time won't do that.

* Ilori - Still has a future with us. As a young CB, he needs playing time. Would have liked to have seen more of him though.

* Assaidi - Was meant to bring in much needed flair and pace out wide and was cheap; we'll make a profit on him. Also, I believe this deal was already in the works before BR took over.

* Markovic - One of the most highly touted young players in the world and for a decent price. His brief appearance against City showed more promise than anything I've seen from Ibe and Alberto (though Ibe, with a year on loan, should develop into a first team player next season).

* Sakho - He was injured much of last year, but I believe him and Lovren will be the first pick pairing before too long. That's what I want to see at least. And I think people are reading too far into left and right CB positions. Lovren is right footed, it should work fine. Hell, Flanno played LB last year.

* Moses - Brought in for basically the same reason as Assaidi. Would have rather we kept Assaidi last year, as he looked much better for Stoke than Moses ever did for us.

* Sahin - Played out of position to accommodate Gerrard. Disappointing as I think he'd be a great fit in our current squad.

* Cisshoko - Gave us depth at LB and did his job last year. Not great, but I would feel better with him in than any of the youth players.

I definitely see what you're saying on all of this though. I just don't think delaying an 18-22 year old coming into the first team is a bad thing. We're doing a bit of a Chelsea and shipping out some promising young prospects on loan to get them consistent matches. The ones that excel will be included in the team when they are ready.

Also, it's worth noting that all of those (besides Markovic) were brought in without the CL. Our options were limited and we had to overpay more often than not. I think we will receive great returns from our investments this summer though. It's taken two seasons, but it seems like BR has more freedom to bring in the players he wants, as opposed to being shackled by the transfer committee.

Borini- so we loaned him to Sunderland with the expectation that he might do well (which he did, even being voted their young player of the year), and then always intended to sell him?  Waste of time then- sell him last summer and move on.

Ilori- if the plan all along was to loan him out for several seasons rather than getting a chance here, someone probably should have told him that.  I suspect he would have elected to stay where he was.

Markovic- good kid, good prospect.  Made sense to me as, at the time, we seemed to be looking to go more 4-3-3ish with wide forwards either side.  Now with Balotelli in, I'm not so sure that's the case for the most part which means I don't see him getting as much time as I might have otherwise.

Sakho- I agree he should be playing next to Lovren, but he hasn't in two games which seems pretty telling.  Guess we'll see what happens over the long term.

Neither Moses nor Cisshoko were needed.  Their very limited minutes could have easily been replaced by the likes of Alberto/Teixeria/Smith.

Sahin didn't work out because we chose near enough the same day he arrived to play Gerrard in his position.  Again, our strategy sucked and led to a nice chunk of wasted coin (paying a penalty to send him back early on top of the already high loan fee just being an extra kick in the teeth).

Secondly, Rodgers and Inglethorpe see him play every single day, they've deemed that he is not good enough yet. It's just a fact. You can't compare someone who has played for Atletico a handful of times with a player that can't even get a pre-season friendly appearance over Wisdom and Kelly.

- Everyone that is still supporting Johnson is silly.

- If we don't win on Sunday I'll start having doubts about the season. Since Rodgers arrived I think we've only lost twice in a row once, so if it happened again right at the start of the season it's not a good omen.

Our midfield is pretty stacked now, we probably have two entire midfields that would be among the best in the league. Hughes (I know you all want him), Bryson. Ward, Hendrick, Eustace, Thorne, Russel, Dawkins. Properly quality options there. *edit* Forgot Omar Mascarell on loan from Real Madrid. 

He might not play every game, so don't get your hopes up there. He's pretty god damn good, but it depends on the system McLaren wants to use. He was stuck with a 4-5-1 last year due to lack of a decent second striker, but we have signed (don't laugh) Leon Best which gives us an option now to go 4-3-3 of 4-4-2. Ibe should be amongst the favourites to start in either formation, but again its down to McLaren if he wants to play a few tighter, defensive formations. 

The players he will be playing with are all easily lower premiership quality. Thorne is injured, but Bryson, Hughes and Hendrick have all had offers from top flight clubs batted away this year. The football is fast, attacking and exciting, nothing like most other sides in the league. We scored more goals than anyone else in the league last year so he's really at a decent place.

&gt;

&gt;The __ship of Theseus__, also known as __Theseus' paradox__, is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) that raises the question of whether an object which has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally [the same object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy\)). The paradox is most notably recorded by [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) in *[Life of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives)* from the late 1st century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.

&gt;The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus), [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates), and [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) and [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke). There are several variants, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

And, it has the clout to actually achieve want it wants a lot of the time by being extremely pedantic - look at the opt outs we have. That 10% voice gets 1000% bigger with the UK onside.

I wish more secessionists realised this. But there is a crisis of opportunity, I think.

This is true. But there will also be more times when it doesn't.

Key info:

&gt; A defensive midfielder by trade, his back-up position as central defender has been coming in particularly useful in a season where Montpellier have had a terrible disciplinary record, with 10 red cards in the first 19 league games, and another in the league cup. He can drop back to the defensive line to prevent the need for an immediate substitution, and when the backline was most seriously impacted by unavailabilities, for the game against Saint-Etienne, he started as part of a back three. In the post-title hangover season, he also ended up playing in both fullback positions as injuries and suspensions took their toll.

The point was for him to improve and reach is value, from an owners point of view football isn't football it's a business and if you buy a player for £10mill you want to sell him for a higher amount and if he was sold the season before Sunderland (a season which saw him get injured twice and score 1 goal) we wouldn't have even had a big half of £14mill. It's not a ""waste of time"" it's a business. 

With Markovic and us playing 4-3-3 the thing we had last season was the option. When Sturridge was injured, 4-3-3 and when Suarez was suspended 4-3-3. Even some games where they both played we had a 4-3-3 system like against Arsenal. He will get the game time whether it's this season or next. When it comes to prospects on that level there's one thing we've seen from Rodgers is they get their opportunities. Sterling, Suso and Flanno being the main 3. 

If you put yourself in the team last season. We had one LB in Enrique and no one thought Flanno would have the impact he did. Bringing in a replacement LB was great. Moses got limited game time because when he first game Rodgers gave him the opportunities and bar Swansea he didn't play very well in any of his chances. Hindsight it's easy to say they were poor loans but at the time they were needed. 

Ilori seems to be getting messed around with a lot which is a shame. 

Manquillo, it's not even arguable he's superior to McLaughlin and it's clear. It's not a waste of money. You think Johnson being 30 and there not being another senior RB in our squad that Manquillo (if brought for the long run) and Wisdom could fit together with the better of the two being the first team starter. 

Even though it's using (not wasting) money, I think the options and having players out on loan is a good way to manage them from a business stand point and a developmental stand point. Borini, Wisdom, Assaidi and Suso all played well on their loans and Teixeria has had a great start with Brighton.

Oh fuck off. I've read extracts I don't have the time nor the gut to read the whole thing. Have you? Anyway put up the quote which makes that claim or retract it. I'm waiting. 

&gt;And I wasn't aware it was an either/or choice to have the EDL or CSE gangs roaming the streets. You ask me which I prefer: I prefer neither. They're both shit in their own way. 

But you admitted that was the logic of the council in your last post here:

&gt;partly because they wanted to avoid groups like the EDL targeting the town which is a valid concern.

So yes, they were afraid of letting these crimes (which they didn't try to stop) get out partly because they were afraid of the EDL were going to rock up in Rochdale. That was their logic and you repeated it. This is where the interests of a ""multicultural"" city of Rochdale were deemed more important than the safety of teenage girls. 

&gt; Covering up crimes isn't a form of anything other than covering things up. Political correctness is a form of treating people like you'd expect to be treated. The one isn't a form of the other.

If political correctness was mere good manners nobody would give a fuck about it.
But we have evidence people were reluctant too approach this crime because the criminals were Pakistani Muslim. It went on for sixteen years, we have evidence of people working in social work being told off for describing the perpetrators as Pakistani Muslim. Have you read the comments by Denis MacShane?

---------------

Concerning our three away days: 

* Away at Sunderland following the international break, and home to West Brom should be manageable with traveling to Partizan in between. Wouldn't be surprised to see a mix of the first team in the Europa game (Hugo, Capoue, Eriksen, Adebayor) with their second team counterparts getting some time against the Black Cats and Baggies.

* Coming home to Stoke may be a challenge after facing Asteras away. Hopefully Villa's defense springs a couple of leaks. Could be a lot worse.

* Palace in December might be a team that showed in can be mid-table without Tony Pulis, or they could be in serious relegation danger. Besiktas *may* be the most tiring away draw, and having to face what looks like a formidable Swans team right afterwards may lead to dropped points.",0,1409339984,null,0,false,0,ck40ast,t3_2ewr56,t1_ck40ast,t3_2ewr56,null,1427294228,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I LOVE my two coastal scents brushes! again cheap and work great, im going to be getting duplicates and looking into the other eye brushes, so far all the reviews look good.

If money is no option then I would go for a sigma collection or just a few brushes, the Sigma E25 is the higher end version of the coastal scents brush. Sigma is absolutely great quality but if you want something a little more affordable or even want to just be able to buy duplicates of them then coastal scents is pretty good and very good quality in my opinion.

Real Techniques are good but again pricey in comparison to the ELF and Coastal Scents which are still great quality, also I always find I only want one or two out of the collections, I wish they sold all the brushes separately so I wasn't wasting money getting brushes I dont want.",0,1409340099,null,0,false,0,ck40cvp,t3_2euoic,t1_ck40cvp,t1_ck3zt7s,null,1427294201,1,false,MakeUpAddictionUK,t5_319vn,1

My mother for example has been appalled by the lack of penitent advocacy she's seen from the nurses involved in my dad care of late, something she took very seriously when she was nursing including long periods doing palliative care. When my mum asked why there were no blankets she was told they'd simply stopped delivering them one day, when she asked why he said he didn't know, no one had ever bothered to ask.

On a side note my mum and dad (a doctor himself) were *very* impressed with the critical care nurses and over all my dads treatment has been fantastic and while my mother hasn't been impressed with how general is done these days (neither was my little brother who trained as a nurse) she feels it's mostly due to a culture that saps initiative and responsibility for check lists and targets. 

Still back to the point... it's not exactly like we live in a day and age in which it's all that hard to blow the whistle on things like this. I mean maybe I'm being too harsh, there were clearly some people involved in speaking out to and getting the times to investigate but honestly do you think you'd not be listened to if you  started to tweet every time a manager told you to not to talk about child abuse especially in the light of something like Yewtree? 

I'm sure there are fantastic people doing the best they could with a bad situation but as I'm also sure there's awful people who turned a blind eye because we've got very clear4 examples of *that* top to bottom everywhere else that is involved. 

My point is just that you shouldn't simply take the word of anyone involved in this at any level with out proof. Place to start an investigation?

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I understand your reasoning... however, the UK believe it or not does look out for the interests of its constituent nations.

By and large, yes. Then again, some of the UK government's choices can be questionable.

Two in particular that I think are unpopular in Scotland are the [refusal to take up the EC's offer of advice](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html) on EU accession for Scotland (on the grounds that it would pre-negotiating), and spreading the [convergence uplift payments](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24874125P) across the UK (despite being awarded entirely on the basis of the state of Scottish farms).

&gt; And, it has the clout to actually achieve want it wants a lot of the time by being extremely pedantic - look at the opt outs we have.

The UK has [three opt-outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Former_opt-outs):

* Schengen. Also granted to Ireland, and I don't see any particular reason why it wouldn't be granted to Scotland. Its only land border is with another non-Schengen country (rUK), so from the rest of the EU's POV there is no material difference if Scotland is in Schengen or not. The UK has a partial opt-out from the [AFSJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice) but this is essentially the implications of Schengen for cross-border policing.
* Euro. Also granted to Denmark, and given the political situation in the UK (there is no great demand for the Euro) I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be carried forward. If it wasn't, there is no requirement for immediate adoption. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden are all in the EU but not the Eurozone - without any formal opt-out.
* [CFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union). The UK opt-out was primarily to ensure that UK citizens could not take cases to the European Court of Justice. The [treaty itself](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) is pretty straightforward - no death penalty, no torture, intellectual property exists, innocent until proven guilty, etc.

The UK also enjoys a rebate, which is currently worth about £5bn (so say £500m to Scotland, on a roughly per-capita basis). 

However the rebate is based on the amount that the UK pays in to the EU relative to the amount it receives (if it pays in £100, and receives £70, it gets 2/3 the difference - or £20), has been reduced by 20%, is likely to be reduced further, and would be much less significant given that Scotland would make a smaller contribution to EU funding.

&gt;This is true. But there will also be more times when it doesn't. That said, if Scotland was of the cooperative type, why doesn't the SNP attempt to gather support from MPs outside of Scotland to progress its aims within the context of the UK, rather than just going for the nuclear option immediately?

I suspect the SNP would have preferred that the next step along the devolution path to be devo-max.

That would [almost certainly have won](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26245611), but no parties were prepared to put forward a specific proposal for what that might mean in practice. Ruth Davidson declared it a ""line in the sand"", and David Cameron wanted an in-out referendum.

Forcing a yes/no question like that was a bit of a gamble, which may well backfire, but that's where we are.

In terms of getting support from MPs outside of Scotland, really that means getting the support of either Labour or the Conservatives. Neither of those have shown any real interest in furthering devolution (and some have actively opposed it, recent announcements aside), let alone independence.

Devolution has restored the Scottish parliament, and while they still send MPs to Westminster the SNP would much rather be a large party in Holyrood vs a tiny party in Westminster (partly because voting patterns are different for Holyrood than Westminster, partly because of AMS vs FPTP). 


&gt; I have to ask, but do you not see even the slightest irony in wanting independence but wanting to be part of another Union which is takes more sovereignty every few years?

Not really, no. I don't find the ""if you're in the EU you're not *really* independent"" argument convincing.

Ireland and Denmark are both independent countries in my book, and neither have the slightest interest in either leaving the EU or rejoining the UK or Sweden.",0,1409341328,null,0,false,0,ck40zpv,t3_2ewmvj,t1_ck40zpv,t1_ck3zbxa,null,1427293905,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I guess you have to consider how long you plan to live where you are (you can always move). Owning a house offers a certain stability and the ability to do what you want with the property. Also instead of spending that £1500 you are putting money into the house, that money doesn't go away its an investment. That should be something to consider. 

Renting is cheap and allows freedom to just move somewhere else if you want and you don't have to make the £60k deposit. 

I guess what im saying in a round about way is that its hard to know what i would do in your shoes without knowing the situation you are in concerning other things in life like you job or being happy with where you live.

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"I think it's that, injury concerns, and a congested fixture list between the Prem, Europe, and cups. Consider that for any given match, he's likely to deploy two of the following as his midfielders who are tasked with both shielding the back line and driving the play forward by distributing the ball to the attacking players: Capoue, Bentaleb, Sandro, Dembele. Three of those four have missed time recently with injury, and the remaining one is just 19. 

Holtby could perhaps play a role as one of those two, but I don't think he's well suited to it; he's not positionally aware enough, and not tidy enough on the ball or accurate enough in his passing. If he remains on the team, it will be as a super sub who can bring a lot of energy in an attacking role late in games. 

Paulinho is similarly ill-suited to play one of those roles, and I think his performance last night was proof: it was unanimously agreed that it was his best game in ages for us, and it came in a forward, free-roaming role. Like Holtby, he lacks the positional sense and ball-distribution skills to really drive play forward. If he remains on the team, it'll be as an attacking player in the same role that Lamela or Eriksen play, in which his offensive flair is useful and he won't be required to hold down space in a more structured defense. 

So, without Stambouli, we've got Capoue, Bentaleb, Sandro, and Dembele. Even if we agree that Sandro and Dembele are suited to the roles Pochetino wants--something yet to be seen, I think--that's a very thin corps of players for two spots in the starting XI that will be critical to our success. This is why Pochetino pursued Schneiderlin, and why a player like Stambouli is apparently our new target. These are the players who are going to connect our more structured defensive group with our more free-flowing offensive group; they're the engine that will drive the team. We NEED to upgrade here.

As you point out no crimes were not investigated because of race they were however not investigated because the police didn't deem the children worth of their protection.

What I'm trying to get at is not investigating the ethnic side of things is part of the same wider disregard for care for the children and the attempt to sweep it under the rug. When you've a wide range of evidence for the outright suppression of that reality that have nothing to do with being afraid of being seen as nonPC then pointing to another example of that that happens where the justification was wanting to downplay ethnic connotations why would you suddenly take this proven group of liars totally at face value? 

Point being that even if there was a genuine fear of being made to look bad by going down the ethnic road (which I'm happy to admit there could have been) it worth remembering that *everything* those in charge did to sweep this under the rug was done in fear of looking bad in a whole range of ways... the problem is that they across the board they cared more about how things looked that fixed the problem and *that* the root cause of everything that happened ""PCness"" even if was simply a problem and not an excuse was just one part of that.

We have had threat levels for decades, the system in place before, during and after the troubles had white, black, amber and red.   Black (special) was introduced during the troubles and was like black but more Irish.  This system was for generic security issues and not just terrorism so some Cold War events pushed the threat level up.  Rarely were threat levels briefed to the public.

There were also seperate matrices for specific threats relating to anything from terrorism to nuclear war, but the system was simplified and made public a few years ago.  Personally I think it was a well-meaning attempt to involve the public in security, but it has quickly become a way of grabbing headlines and spreading fear.

This is largely because whilst the police, armed forces and security service have standard procedures for each level, the public don't and so the level is meaningless.  Also the public did a good job of being vigilant during the troubles without knowing the threat state so publicising it is probably ineffective.",0,1409343199,null,0,false,0,ck41xzq,t3_2ex0wd,t1_ck41xzq,t1_ck400s2,null,1427293454,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,DupaZupa,null,null,"When the discussion is about benching Gerrard for a bit, both attack and defense are always relevant. My reply is more about reasons why people wanted Gerrard to start less last season, and now its happening again. I may have mentioned some points you didn't bring up, but I've seen a lot from the side of people that believe Gerrard shouldn't start anymore.

And exactly, we got scored on 50+ times last season, and you blame Gerrard for that? Instead of the 4 other players with major responsibilites. You realize we had to start Cissokho and Flanagan at some points last season right, and at that point BR said fuck defense and went all attack. You're going to concede goals if you go all attack, even if you have Mascherano as your DM.

I simply disagree that Gerrard needs to be benched yet, he added way more than he cost us. And I feel anytime we lose, he will get blamed. You'll see Glen Johnson or Skrtel get called out for bad defense, but with Gerrard its already a foregone conclusion, ""oh yeah he's a bad dm, what do you expect"", which turns into ""we have to bench him"" opinions.

People need to realize there is a give and take having Gerrard as the DM, he won't be ideal defensively, but he's almost perfect in attack.

Our Captain deserves more respect than that. I fear the day when I watch him play and have to admit Gerrard is getting in the way of the team/he's past it/he needs to come off the bench. But I am not even close to convinced that I have seen that day yet.

I watched the City game, and there is no individual that deserves the blame for the loss. My only issue was how long it took us to get a shot on target, 31min, and we were playing well in that first 40min. Gerrard gives us the passes that break apart good defenses like that, and benching him to me means we go even longer without a shot on target in a game like that.

He simply adds too much to the attack still to be considered for benching. Hopefully going back to the diamond will see us getting more wins and I won't have to see so many ""time to bench Gerrard"" posts.

Besides, we've only played two games, and have been basically experimenting with the defense. We got a tough win in one, and almost rallied against City, way too soon to start shaking things up, and there really isn't even a reason to do so yet.",0,1409343401,null,0,1409355380,0,ck421ub,t3_2exl8y,t1_ck421ub,t1_ck414uo,null,1427293405,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;now Torres (his work rate never dropped)

Is an absolute lie. Look at any thread about Torres and it will be flooded with people praising his workrate. Sure, when he absolute murders a chance people will give him shit but his workrate is never doubted. You seem reasonable but you're just making that up.

Rafa was ugly for all Chelsea fans. I didn't like him, but I didn't run around bitching about it.

I don't really think we have any player at the club right now that the blame will switch to. If it happens, it happens. Torres and Rafa are a special breed. Torres was... Shit. Rafa was... Not a good manager for US (he's doing fine in Napoli, don't twist what I'm saying.

Lukaku leaving was in part due to the fact there one striker spot is always taken by default because of Torres. 

He's had some good moments and some awful ones too, I don't think anyone here thinks he's not trying. He's just not good enough for this team anymore and it's time we just admit it hasn't panned out and take the chance to move him on.

true,bockers7,lfc99,,"&gt; When the discussion is about benching Gerrard for a bit, both attack and defense are always relevant. 

No it's  not because I'm discussing his CDM role. He is not longer a CM. His primary role is not to be part of our attack. That is just an added bonus IF he was good at his other CDM duties, which he is not. 

&gt;And exactly, we got scored on 50+ times last season, and you blame Gerrard for that? Instead of the 4 other players with major responsibilities.

Not what I said. I said you cannot just blame the back 4. They are a defensive unit, and Gerrard's lack of positioning definitely had an impact. Stop putting words in mouth bc it will be impossible to have a proper and educational discussion. 

&gt;People need to realize there is a give and take having Gerrard as the DM, he won't be ideal defensively, but he's almost perfect in attack.

Again, that's what a CM is for. Not a CDM. I don't want my CDM running my attack. I don't need Viera, Deschamps, Makelele running my offense. His responsibilities as a CDM are different, and although having his presence on the ball is definitely a plus, it is not something I want or need from my CDM. 

&gt;Our Captain deserves more respect than that. I fear the day when I watch him play and have to admit Gerrard is getting in the way of the team/he's past it/he needs to come off the bench. But I am not even close to convinced that I have seen that day yet

That's great and all, but we need 3 pts this weekend. Simple as that. He was poor in the last two games in a CDM role. Either you give him help next to him or you take him out. Try Lucas next to him, idk I'm not Brendan, but Gerrard back there by himself does not work. 

And as for the rest, I see yout point and understand exactly where you're coming from. I just disagree. We have different opinions on what the role of the CDM should be. 

Last thing, ""We are experimenting with the defense."" Key word experimenting. Take Gerrard out and see how it goes. Send him a message. Idk. He should be guaranteed in the starting XI, just the way I look at it.

It was, and to a certain extent the No camp walked right into it by persisting with the ""you'll lose the pound"" soundbyte rather than the slightly more nuanced but less catchy ""you can keep the pound but not in a currency union which will have economic implications"".

I suspect the remainder of the No campaign will focus on anything to keep the over 50's on side (pensions, heating bills, ""aren't those Yes voters thugs?""). I don't see currency or the EU coming up again.

So far this season we've shown that we haven't learned from our mistakes from last season: the lack of substitutes, the unrelenting perseverance with a 4-2-3-1 formation (despite it being clear that we're struggling to score goals) and an unwillingness to change up the team. We are becoming very stale, very fast. 

McGinn and Flood have been dire, the former having been poor for many months now. It's time to drop them both and experiment a little. We have Nicky Low on the bench who is the same kind of player as Flood but can actually spot a pass further than six yards. I'd also love to see young Scott Wright get some game time but McInnes is hell bent on starting McGinn week in week out and rarely, if ever, substitutes him.

Goodwillie has also been shite, although it doesn't help that McInnes plays him as a lone striker. He is not at all suited to that role and it shows. Rooney has to start but he *has* to get some decent service this time. I can't imagine how frustrated he's been.

I had hoped we would've signed a left back by now but it doesn't look likely that we'll sign one at all before the window closes. If Partick are sensible they'll try to put pressure on, assuming he starts, Considine at LB. He is *awful* at LB but again, it's McInnes' fault for shoehorning him into a position he's completely alien to.

true,DupaZupa,null,null,"&gt; Not what I said. I said you cannot just blame the back 4. They are a defensive unit, and Gerrard's lack of positioning definitely had an impact. Stop putting words in mouth bc it will be impossible to have a proper and educational discussion.

You were discussing Gerrard, and then said all the blame cannot be placed on the back four. There is an implication that it should be on Gerrard then, be clearer before you start blaming people for putting words in your mouth. Accusing me of putting words in your mouth is what makes proper discussion impossible. I was just pointing out it was our play style, plus our back 4, plus gerrard that cost us, instead of attacking me, just ask me to clarify my point if its unclear to you.

Anyway, my point was that Gerrard brings to our attack something that no one else does. Without him our attack suffers, suffers more than our defense suffers because he is our DM.

And do you even watch the matches? Gerrard played beside Lucas against Southhampton. It was awful. We still gave away poor goals, even though we had a true DM on field.

Every match that goes by, I'm more inclined to believe that defense is BR's major weakness, and its wrong to blame Gerrard.

I hope to see the diamond against Spuds, with Gerrard as DM, then Henderson and either Lallana or Coutinho in front of him. And I very confident such a line up will win us the 3pts.",0,1409345567,null,0,false,0,ck4359e,t3_2exl8y,t1_ck4359e,t1_ck42rvq,null,1427292894,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt; Stambouli is solid defensively, great at interceptions and lay offs to build up breaks. His versatility is very impressive. Guile player.

https://twitter.com/SpursInTheBlood/status/505453412419653632
&gt; Stambouli is a solid CDM for Montpellier. His long passing is a very big part of his game and has a dangerous shot on him from long range... My friend even went as far as saying he'd fit right into Pochettino's style of play &amp; start alongside Capoue. He's highly rated in France.

&gt;over the course of his stint in the senior team has shown versatility in his positioning, able to be used in the rearguard or as a bona fide central midfielder. More often than not, though, he is the holding presence in the midfield that binds the team together...Spurs fans might have hoped for Morgan Schneiderlin this summer, but in Stambouli they have a player with the potential to replicate the astounding rise of the Southampton star, whose profile is remarkably similar to the player it seems they are about to sign.

&gt; Schneiderlin, though, is perhaps a more natural central midfielder; a player willing to shuttle box-to-box and cover every area of the field. Stambouli is not a figure wanting for commitment – his wholehearted approach to the game has won him a great deal of acclaim in France – yet he is most comfortable patrolling the area in front of the defence.

Yes we are free country but covering your face in the instance of a Niqab is extremely rude and it's also very backward which is why so many people don't like it. I'm not defending the behaviour you say you've received as it's horrible to be shouted at etc but a lot of people also take offence to the site of a Niqab/Burqa because it's anti social.
  

My own personal conclusion, based on reading the available hadith and Qur'anic sources, is that niqab was worn by the Umm ul-Mumin, who all female Muslims should attempt to emulate, and so niqab is not obligatory but highly recommended. 

  Plus wearing such a thing doesn't stop my brain from working. It doesn't stop my hands from working. If you want me to be part of society, then you've got to admit that often half the problem is often that people see me in my niqab and don't want to engage with me as they would anyone else. I've seen countless occasions where people won't even so much as make eye contact with me, much less speak to me like the normal human being I am. And yet if they did so, I would happily speak and interact with them. A niqab has a person wearing it!

Council tax payment responsibility is ranked in the following order

 1) The person who lives there, who owns the freehold;

 2) The person who lives there, who owns the leasehold;

 3) The person who lives there, who is a statutory or ‘secure’ tenant;

 4) The person who lives there, who has a contractual licence;

 5) The person who lives there, or;

 6) The owner.

If you happen upon a situation where there are multiple people living in the same property, the responsibility is shared amongst the people who share the highest ranking position.

For example, if you jointly share with three assured-shorthold tenants then you're all responsible.

If you jointly share with the owner, and two other tenants, then ultimately the owner is responsible (although he'll likely build in the cost of council tax into your tenancy - it just means that the council can't chase you).

ii) I predict there will be Muslim protests and hand-wringing statements.  They will tell us over and over that this not represent their religion.  They will do what they can to get Islam off the hook, whilst taking absolutely no blame for the culture which gave rise to these rapes.  They will also attempt to portray UK Islam as the victim of a media witch-hunt.

Do Muslims feel genuine outrage?  You wouldn't know it.  [Here's the only mention I could find about Rotherham on today's r/Islam](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2ewxxo/rotherham_race_and_white_paedophilia/).  As usual, it's a retreat into victimization and blaming everyone but their own communities.  Still - the post has not received any votes and not a single Muslim redditor has thought to supply a comment.

I don't think Muslims are unique in this attitude.  I saw exactly the same silence when the Irish reports on systemic Catholic abuse and cover-ups came out.  The religious' first thought when it comes to scandal is to protect the religion.  It's rare that you see anyone brave enough to look at examine the problems in their own ideology.

You see half of the blame is on society for not wanting to engage you, you tosser it from other people's eyes, all we can see is a walking cloak and two popping out from the face, how can you engage with someone like that? It's very hard to build friendships and relationships with someone who's dressed like that. 

  You interact with me by treating me exactly the same as anyone else. And I have had little to no problem in either making friends or in doing anything social with them. 

&gt;You can still be a Muslim and not oppress yourself with that cloak, wearing it won't make you any more or less a Muslim than an ordinary western dressed Muslim. And heck people will be a lot more positive to you!

  I would hardly call a personal interpretation of religious faith oppression. Neither do I believe that taking off the niqab, or not wearing it at all for that matter, makes anyone a lesser Muslim. It is simply that I believe that I myself should wear it.

true,WK_of_Angmar,null,null,"Well, I took Maths, Further Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Critical Thinking at AS level and I got A's for all those subjects (A is the highest grade at AS level). This was typical of every applicant - it is very rare to find an applicant who doesn't have straight A's at AS level.

An application to Cambridge differs from those to other universities because Cambridge makes you fill out an extra application form called the SAQ. Most universities will only ever see your letter grade (i.e. they will only see the ""A"") whereas Cambridge asks for the exact UMS marks that you received in every examination in the SAQ. This allows them to distinguish between an applicant who has scraped A's in their subjects and an applicant who has very high A's. It also allows them to calculate the percentage across your top 3 subjects.

Which year are you in? A-levels have been reformed so I believe that you no longer get the AS-level after year 12, but you take all of your examinations that count towards the A-level grade at the end of year 13. Apparently examination boards will still make you sit exams at the end of year 12, in order to allow the universities to have the same level of discrimination as they did with the previous system, but I'm not too sure about this.

It is not clear to me how much weighting the TSA exam had on my application. A few years ago, a [statistical report](https://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/admissions/research/docs/prefective_effectiveness_of_metrics_in_admission.pdf) was released which suggests that the AS-level UMS is a much better predictor of the future performance of an applicant and that the TSA was less effective and less consistent. Having said that, there are many colleges that you must choose from, and, if you are having difficulty in selecting one to apply to, it makes sense to apply to one which makes you sit the TSA if you are very good at the exam (or don't apply to one if you are not good at the exam). I am sure that others will dissuade you from choosing a college tactically, but if you honestly don't have a preference of colleges, or there are many that meet your primary criteria (usually location), then I can't see any harm in trying to boost your chances. I specifically chose a college that made me sit the TSA because I thought I would be good at it and I didn't have any strong inclination for any particular college. You can see a list of the colleges and whether they make you sit the TSA test on [this](http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/compsci/) page.

For the first year of Computer Science, you have to sit an additional exam from the Natural Sciences course or a psychology paper which counts as a quarter of the first year's grade. So the first year is actually 50% Computer Science, 25% Mathematics and 25% course-from-NatSci-or-Psychology (most Computer Science students choose Physics). However, you can choose to do Computer Science with Mathematics so it's 50% Computer Science and 50% Mathematics during the first year. If you choose to take the Computer Science with Mathematics option then you will be required to sit the STEP examination. Otherwise, I don't believe any college has a standard STEP offer so you should be OK there.",0,1409351232,null,0,false,0,ck45tam,t3_2emnlp,t1_ck45tam,t1_ck29gmg,null,1427291650,1,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,1

We definitely need to score more so another striker would have been ideal in the summer but alas. The good thing is we're keeping our incredible defensive record with 1 goal conceded in 4 (not counting the loss to Northampton in the league cup). More importantly, I love the way we play, our passing is good, KMac in midfield makes it all tick. Van La Parra looks a good buy, very pacy and confident in taking his man on. Sako is Sako, I love him but I know plenty others who want him to play like Ronaldo every match, he's clearly ready for this division. Looking forward to Saville Rowe making their debuts, they're well suited ;) for the Championship. In Kenny we trust, best manager since Turner.

So all in all, happy with the start but need more goals in the coming matches. I think anything less than playoffs would be a little disappointing.

His mind probably changed regarding his ambitions in the game after that. That’s more than a valid reason to take a step back (or down) from playing at the top level.

We shouldn't just jump to whatever conclusion seems right in your head without knowing what is going on in his personal life.

I don't really see many Gers fans on this subreddit for whatever reason, but I'd hazard a guess it's because every time there's an article posted here, it's either about us losing a game or another new financial crisis, with the usual comments from non-Rangers supporters. I get why some find ""banter"" relating to our finances, position in Scottish football, and history to be amusing, as on the surface it's just banter, but after close to three years of it, it gets a little bit tiring and at this point I believe a large amount of it is just a mask for the general hatred towards us now.

&gt;Only Fools and Horses was sold to countries throughout the world. Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, New Zealand, Pakistan, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa and Spain are among those who purchased it.[103] In all countries in which ex-Serbo-Croatian is spoken the title was Mućke (or Мућке in Cyrillic script), which can roughly be translated as ""shady deals."" The show is particularly popular in the former Yugoslavia, and is regarded as a cult series in Croatia and Serbia.

Interesting. I guess there was a fair amount of visual and slapstick comedy which transcends language. And:

&gt;In January 2012 US network ABC commissioned a pilot of an Only Fools and Horses remake titled ""King of Van Nuys"", written by Scrubs writers Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley.[111] It was developed, rejected and then redeveloped - only to be rejected again later in the year. The pilot starred John Leguizamo as Del, Dustin Ybarra as his brother Rodney and Christopher Lloyd as Grandad

I'm not sure if that is true or not, but most topics on reddit involving Sikhs have alot of comments similar to yours in my experience.  She begins with:

&gt;The Sikh community is distinct and popular images of Sikhs in the West have often portrayed them as a gallant and courageous “martial race”7
, as victims of racial discrimination, as activists dedicated to their faith and as talented and educated businessmen (Singh and Tatla 2006: 9). This contrasts to those experiences of BrAsian Muslims,8 for example, studies have suggested that Muslims in Britain are more likely to suffer from poorer housing conditions, possess poorer healthcare and are more likely to be unemployed within the labour market compared to their Sikh 
(and Hindu) counterparts (Abbas 2005: 10), moreover, education studies (2005) have also shown that “the Muslim percentage of those with higher educational qualifications was just below the England and Wales average (13.5% versus 14.3%). For Sikhs however it was 17%” (Abbas 2005: 30). 
&gt;Sikhs in the UK are thus percieved as a community which has integrated and adapted well within society in which there seems to have manifested a union between the Sikhs and the British.9 For Sikhs, the acceptance, and to some extent, the conscious embrace of ‘Britishness’ enables them to represent a modern, independent and hardworking community which has subsequently transpired to give them a greater 
social status and mobility as the mainstream dominant values of British society such as ‘Westerness’, ‘Secularisation’ and ‘middle-class ccupancy’ (Chakraborti and Garland: 2004) have been willingly endorsed by the Sikh diaspora

and moves on to this later on:

&gt;In the attempt to negotiate this position we can see the development of a Sikh Islamophobia which in the context of postcolonial Britain attempts to write the Western character of the Sikh community by differentiating them in radical ways from the community which is currently seen as the epitome of Anti-Western sentiments.

I honestly don't understand this whole segment.  Somehow Sikhs are Islamophobic because they want people to know that they are not Muslims, an identity a lot of Sikhs are mistakenly associated with.  I feel like this is a natural reaction, if your being mistaken for being a member of another religion you would naturally want to correct that.  I don't see any malice in taking that position.  Even if Islamophobia didn't exist, and for example if someone had mistaken a Sikh for a Muslim with no perceived negative connotations attached, you would still want to correct them.  I feel like this is simply attributing Islamophobia to a benign reaction to mistaken identity.",0,1409355294,null,0,false,0,ck47mvw,t3_2ey4yf,t1_ck47mvw,t1_ck44iwo,null,1427290730,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

And:

&gt; *In Bradford you see like so many Muslim guys who will come to Sikh parties with Kara’s on so they look basically like they’re Sikh, like if you’ve got cut hair you cant tell, so if you’ve got a Kara on you could be a Sikh, and then if a girl falls for it and gets emotionally attached to the Muslim there’s only so much you can do, like a distant Sikh relative of mine, the same thing happened to her a Muslim guy took her and she’s now left her family and they miss her so much but cant do anything cos she’s like living in London with him and no one knows really where she is cos they’ve cut all ties from the family, he met her in a party, this is what they do they’ll go out dance with them, take their number and carry on playing this game that they’re a Sikh and then when the girl gets emotionally attached he’ll say actually I’m not a Sikh but then its too late, you hear so many stories that the girls even get shipped off to Pakistan and they get forgotten about and they get treated badly*

It is possible that she is version of Clara - but why would there be a version of Clara that looks so different from her? The same objection can be phrased wrt to her being River Song.

&gt;Try to discourage low quality submissions - The Sun, Record, Mirror, Mail, Express, Blogspam etc unless it's original content (polls for example) or is of unusual quality - e.g. investigative journalism.

This I am wholly in favour of. I'd rather see a political blog than a tabloid. Unless that tabloid piece is a great piece of journalism, or it's the only place that's reporting a 'major claim', then I don't see why it should be accepted here, but I would need to discuss this with the other mods before implementing any sort of ruling on it, hope that satisfies ya :)

&gt;You don't need to be too heavy handed and you don't need to be too public either. A wee word in someone's ear goes a lot further than arguing with them with the M hat on it in a thread.
Be tough on transient accounts. If there's a very new or very low post count user here then be suspicious and err on the side of caution if they're inflammatory.

For these issues, we've (semi) agreed on a 3-strike rule. A PM, a public warning, a ban. We've discussed (but again not agreed) on a similar system to driving licenses, where the severity of your warning gets reduced after a period of time.

On transient accounts, we've discussed implementing a policy similar to /r/trees, which deletes comments from accounts with negative karma.
