true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Comment section was alright. We will score fewer goals, accepting that Skrtel and Gerrard will score fewer and fullbacks remain at the same level we will still have relatively underwhelming Coutinho and Hendo end product that should improve. Then we can hope Studge replicates his form and bank on Lallana and Markovic providing better options on either wing or from bench than Moses (1 goal) and Aspas. That is still not taking into account a new forward who will hopefully score 15 goals and Sterlings expected improvement when played more than half a season. We will lose some goals but gain more from better net end product from midfield, fewer from forwards, and a lot more from bench when we aren't winning by multiple goals anymore.


Of these things I would expect either forward or midfielder to under perform from injuries as happens to most teams (Sturridge was hindered by injuries last season, missing 10 or so games he could have possible started and increased his goals).   We will find out if we are lucky with Hendo and Coutinho being injury free most of the season last year and same for Lallana and Can. But somewhere something will go wrong and at least in midfield we are prepared with multiple options. It's forward and defensively I'm a bit more worried about. I fully expect our fullbacks to perform better due to Flanno having his breakthrough season and the others being injury prone.   
The CB however we banked on Lovren to solve a huge problem with leadership and consistency, having him out injured would fuck us over as our current CB group has been stated to lack leadership by the manager mutiple times, BR will have to find a way to coach that aspect while the season goes. 


Overall I'm optimistic we have enough depth to put out decent team regardless of injuries, but would want a proper title challenge and if a good forward doesn't come we will have to fight for 4th place which is acceptable to some degree. Spurs are still lagging behind however much they believe their squad is as good as ours, it's the Mancs and the huge number of players they have and can bring who are already complete while we are trying to make ours develop to that level that worries me most. 

That said I'm fucking excited for the new season, BR did after all turn a expensive squad with huge wages to smaller and cheaper squad that moved up from 8th to challenging for the title to the last day. I'm sure if given a slightly weaker starting 11 with a stronger squad he  could compete with the best, and we have already a system that most of our players play under, the only sorting that is needed is new roles for new players. If the season starts and we are playing once or twice a week, you won't hear me bitching about possible failures of the window, I will sit back and enjoy the countless content that will be produced weekly by the league and cups.",0,1407384843,null,0,false,0,cjj7sac,t3_2ctx98,t1_cjj7sac,t3_2ctx98,null,1435114072,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

1) Lambert isn't a target man, he's just talk and strong, he actually scores fuck all with his head, he's a great hold up player who involves those around him and makes them shine by playing lots of through balls, perfect for Sterling or Markovic

2) yes we realise we are in the Champions League (it's fucking brilliant though isn't it?)

3) we can't not go for players because wer worried RM or Barcelona will come in, if that's the case we'd have to stop going for world class/potentially world class players just in case. We are below those two and Bayern in terms of attractiveness along with City, PSG, Monaco and Chelsea for money, like it or not.

4) every knows we need a back up striker hence why we went for Remy, hence why Rodgers has said we need one

I actually agree with most of what you are saying

I think Sturridge has earned the right to be main man and I think you're right another star striker could throw him off so someone like the players you mentioned or a Firminio/Volland or sadly a Remy would be perfect

I also think other teams have recruited well but so have we. City and Chelsea were always going to recruit well nothing we can do they'll do it every year. Arsenal were lucky Sanchez was available as they were with Ozil. Everton have the same players as last year just permanently.

I think you made some good points( esp about fantasising over players that aren't gonna happen) but you waffle a tad.

In-universe answer: The Reapers are obviously sentient creatures, so maybe they have freewill to the point where they don't always want to show up, or maybe they are just off feeding on other paradoxes. This is a bad answer, I know. Why the Reapers don't show up all the time is really just a plot hole. There are numerous plot holes in the Whoniverse. We just accept it and move on.

RL answer: it would get old, like others have said. The whole show is based around messing with time and paradoxes, so they would be popping up everywhere nonstop in every episode. The Doctor couldn't even stop the Reapers, so imagine him having to battle them every time he creates a paradox. It would be nuts.

I'll say something grossly unpopular here, and I'm not trying to sympathize with Agger, but wouldn't we have rather spent ~ 40M on two fullbacks and brought in a loan CB to test the waters with Agger, Skrtel, Sakho, Toure, Coates, and Kelly (and where's our Ilori) as depth in the center? As opposed to the ~ 40M we'll have paid for Lovren and Moreno if we do actually secure the ladder, with hopes of Manquillo progressing...

It's obvious.

Agger isn't the leader Brendan is looking for, and his injury record isn't helping his case to stay as first choice over Sakho who be bought for big money. Lovren was the nail in the coffin.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"The major supermarkets over here are roughly the same - Tesco, Asda and Morrisons are ""the big three"" directly comparable, offer a lot of price matching deals against each other, and buy nearly identical own-brand products from the same manufacturers (or at least it appears that way for a lot of things). Tesco are the largest supermarket chain in the UK, but they had a bad year last year so they might not continue to expand as fast as they have been. They also had to pull out of the USA within the last few years as their chain of fresh fruit &amp; veg shops over there (Fresh &amp; Easy iirc) wasn't doing well at all.

The other supermarkets, from what I know, are as follows:

* Sainsbury's - almost comparable to ""the big three"" but is smaller. Sells very similar products at only marginally higher prices, but that's only because of the price lowering war between the big three.
* Aldi/Lidl - cheap, poorer quality ""basic"" goods (bread, veg, potatoes etc) but some good ""exotic"" products which you can't get elsewhere for the same quality/£. Worth a look if you have one for bargains on interesting foods. EDIT: This is not to say at all that the food sold here is not fit for consumption, it's just assessed at a lower standard than the major supermarkets. For example, apples might be misshapen or very slightly bruised, potatoes might be all sorts of odd shapes, bananas might be straight, sausages might be made with more bread than other supermarkets etc.
* Waitrose - up market compared to the ""big three"" - Good quality foods but at a higher price. 
* M&amp;S Food - normally only found in their stores or in motorway service stations - the food is good but it's expensive, like almost everything in their stores. 

There are smaller ""corner"" stores as well, that vary from location to location - some of the large supermarkets (Tesco, Morrisons, Asda are just launching) are trying to expand into the convenience market - Tesco have the ""Tesco Express"" format, Morrisons have the ""Morrisons Local"". They are competing with the established players in this market as well as locally-run stores. The main established player is The Co-Operative (who incidentally have a range of store types from funeral homes to banks to food stores etc) who brought out one of the other major players, Somerfield, a few years ago. The other main name is Spar, who have been going for years and years now. 

The main benefit of the local stores is convenience - they offer a few products that people need every day (some groceries and frozen foods, newspapers, magazines, milk, sandwiches, bottled drinks, pet food, tissues, household cleaning supplies, laundry supplies, cigarettes, alcohol etc) but at a generally higher price than the supermarkets because you pay for the convenience factor.

Tesco also offer a ""metro"" service in fuel stations - mainly selling things for the road - snacks, hot drinks, cold drinks, sandwiches, some limited groceries etc. Most places here will have a small shop attached to a fuel station selling these things, even if the fuel station is at the exit of a large supermarket - a lot of people come in only for fuel because the supermarket fuel here tends to be a few pennies cheaper than the regular stations.",0,1407395813,null,0,1407432319,0,cjjbheu,t3_2cr7uh,t1_cjjbheu,t1_cjj4agr,null,1435115603,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Agger go out of hvis way to support people and causes that he believes in - in Denmark he is extremely dedicated to support the danish war veterans organisation.

Agger is molded from a pretty 'tough' ghettoarea (by danish standards) on the outskirts of Copenhagen with a lot of unemployment, crime, drinking, drugs and what more. That has contributed to Aggers dedication and at the same time contributed to Agger developing a very proud character. I'm absolutely certain, that there is nothing Agger would wan't more than play for (and live in) Liverpool for the rest of his career. However, Daniel is the kind of person/player, that not only feel disappointed when not playing/in the starting 11 on saturdays - he is devestated and more importantly, embarrassed!

&gt; **[Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Practical/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958083)**
&gt; 
&gt; This book was written by the father of ""value investing"", and the mentor of Warren Buffett, who is widely accepted to be the world's most successful investor. 
&gt; 
&gt; It was originally published in 1948, but Ben Graham updated it periodically over the years, and it stands as true today as it ever has.
&gt; 
&gt; **[Beating the Street - Peter Lynch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958226)**
&gt; 
&gt; Published in 1994, this is arguably showing its age more than Intelligent Investor. Either way, valuable reading from one of the best managers of money in the past few decades.
&gt; 
&gt; **[Naked Trader - Robbie Burns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Naked-Trader-anyone-trading-shares/dp/0857191705/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958400)**
&gt; 
&gt; Subtitled ""How anyone can make money trading shares"", this is an entertaining, tongue-in-cheek account of one financial journalist's attempt to quit his job and make £1,000,000 using a short-to-medium term trading strategy. Not very scientific, but an interesting counterpoint to the previous recommendations.
&gt; 
&gt; **[Smarter Investing - Tim Hale](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Investing-Simpler-Decisions-Financial/dp/0273785370/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958561)**
&gt; 
&gt; The ultimate counterpoint to attempting to ""beat the markets"" - after spending 15 years working in active fund manager, Tim Hale concluded that the best outcomes for most investors in most situations would be a simple portfolio of ""passive"" investments (that is, funds which attempt to track a market, rather than outperform it). This style is favoured by the likes of Monevator, and many of the subscribers here.
&gt; 
&gt; **[Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letters - Warren Buffett](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)**
&gt; 
&gt; Not a book, but a series of essays over the years from the world's most successful investor. Makes interesting reading! Notably, the 2014 letter (not published in the above link but published [here in abridged form](http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/02/24/warren-buffett-berkshire-letter/)) implies that he now feels most investors would be best served by low-cost trackers.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"I may be biased but I'd suggest getting an express service from London Paddington out to Hereford, and getting off at some of the stops on the route - Malvern is a lovely town located in the Malvern Hills, with a lot of picturesque old buildings, a good theatre/cinema if you want to stay for a play etc, and it has wonderful views of the surrounding countryside, and there are some good bike rides or hikes to be had over the Malvern Hills. 

Ledbury is the next place down the line that I'd recommend - it's a small town where I grew up, and it has a nice high street with lots of old buildings, including a wonderfully preserved market house from 1617, which still hosts a street market on a regular basis, and what is widely considered to be the best timber framed house in the country, dating from the early 1600s. You might also consider a trip up to Eastnor to see the lovely castle there, which is actually a mock castle built in the 19th century as a manor house - it's still worth a visit though, and there are loads of events held there every year, from mud running to off-road driving (Land Rover have an off-road driving school very nearby, this is also where they test new models) and the Malvern Showground hosts many more events as well - have a look and see what's on when you plan to visit - it might be worth you having a look.

And Hereford, whilst it is a small city, might be worth a visit in passing as well due to the wonderful cathedral, as well as some very good older buildings and the buttermarket, an indoor market that's been held in Hereford since 1860.

Dare I say it, it's realism and a sensible business model.  European success is a pipe dream in the modern era, and Celtic will win the league at a canter regardless of their spend. I don't believe it's sensible for any Scottish club to base their business model on a prolonged stay in Europe; danger that way lies.

Even if Celtic were to get to, say, the last 16 of Europe, the revenue gain would be lower than the cost of bringing in and paying the players necessary to do the job.

From a purely business perspective Celtic will have the same outcome this season whether they invest £5 million or £50 million pounds.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;__Chorlton-cum-Hardy__ is a [suburban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb) area of the city of [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester), England, known locally as __Chorlton__. It is about four miles southwest of [Manchester city centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_city_centre). Pronunciation varies: /ˈtʃɔrltən/ *__CHORL__-tən* and /ˈtʃɒlən/ *__CHOL__-ən* are both common.

&gt;By the 9th century, there was an Anglo-Saxon settlement here. Later in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages), improved drainage methods led to population growth. In the late [Victorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era) and [Edwardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardian) periods, its perceived rural character made it popular among the [middle class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class). The loss of its railway station, the conversion of larger houses into flats or bedsitters, and significant social housing development to the south of the area changed its character again in the 1970s.

true,tfb,null,null,"I want to add a comment on helmets: I am adding it at top-level rather than in reply to one of the helmet threads as those are going to get buried.

In particular I want to use a bit of physics to counter some of the dangerous rubbish which various people are saying.  By ""dangerous"" I don't mean ""politically unnacceptable to me"" but rather ""likely to increase your chance of dying or brain damage"" (and I would rather die than suffer serious brain damage).

So one of the claims made was that if you wear a helmet when ""cycling slowly"" you should wear one when walking.  Let's look at that.  Based on my GPS logs I walk at an average of about 5km/h (~3mph) and ride at about 20km/h (~12.5mph).  These are averages, in London, so in fact I ride a fair bit faster than that but spend a bunch of time at lights &amp;c.  But let's take the averages as that underestimates the speed I ride at which makes things look safer.

Now the thing that hurts you isn't speed: it's kinetic energy.  And kinetic energy goes as speed *squared*.  So the ratio between the kinetic energy involved in riding and that in walking is (20/5)^2, which is 16: cycling is *16 times* worse than walking, and that is why you need a helmet when cycling and not when walking.

There are, of course, other factors which make this difference even worse: people generally walk on pavements, but ride on roads. Cars (which have even worse KE figures: a car going at 30mph has 2.25 times the KE of one going at 20mph, for instance) occur on roads but generally not on pavements.  Stopping distances also go up aggressively with speed for reasons related both to KE and human reflex times: a person walking can stop dead in two steps (say 2m) but can't do anything like that on a bike.  Both of these factors further increase the difference in risk and severity of accidents.

Finally let's debunk the claim that, if you fall off a bike, you fall the same distance as you do when walking, so it is no more dangerous.  First of all this assumes that the cycling accidents that cause head injuries are generally just falling off the bike: they're not.  But for the sake of argument let's assume they are.  Well, you do fall the same distance, or less even, so perhaps this is right.  It would be right *if you fell onto ice* or some other surface with very low friction.  But you don't: you fall onto a road which has extremely high friction.  If your head hits the road this *dramatically* increases the amount of KE dumped into your head, so falling off a bike is *not* the same as falling over when walking, at all.

Wear a helmet when cycling: do not listen to the stupid people.",0,1407402998,null,0,1407403199,0,cjjd1v6,t3_2cruhu,t1_cjjd1v6,t3_2cruhu,null,1435116430,5,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,5

This was because Jews tended to be involved in money-lending. Culturally, Christians were morally forbidden from lending money / making profit from money-lending, so if you needed a loan you had to go the local jewish quarter. The other reason for this was because Jews were at risk from reprisals, they had to be able to take work with them - no good if you have a craftsmen's workshop. With the gold and silver they earned from this, Jews also became great jewelers, and so they were perceived to have a lot of wealth and happily lend it at very high interest and make profit off of the 'poor' Christians.

They were seen as the 'nasty bankers' of the middle ages, and it hasn't helped that historically Jews were insular, they kept to their own quarter and community and seldom mixed / married with Christians.

&gt;__Roath Park__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Parc y Rhath*) [Cardiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), is one of Cardiff's most popular parks, owned by [Cardiff County Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_County_Council) and managed by the Parks Section. It retains a classic [Victorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era) atmosphere and has many facilities. The park has recently been awarded the prestigious [Green Flag award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Flag_award) to recognise its high quality and its importance to [Cardiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff). Roath Park has widely diverse environments across the park.

&gt;The park was built on 130 acres (0.53 km^2) of reformed [bogland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog), known then as a malarial bog, and includes a 30-acre (120,000 m^2) lake 1.3 miles (2.1 km) around, formed by the damming of the Nant Fawr stream. It is a popular facility for fishing and rowing. There are four islands within a conservation area, home to many [water birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bird). The main park includes a large playground, floral displays, the [glasshouse conservatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatory_(greenhouse\)) and recreational areas.

Oh, a parade on the Shankill for Brian Robinson, a man that indiscriminately murdered two Catholics? Say nahim""), backward thinking (gay marriage, abortion, welfare, health) and bigoted right down to the core (""I'd trust them to go to the shop for me""). Then you have the actual politicians. Ruth Patterson, a woman that is elected to simply say the words ""flag"", ""disgrace"", and to act like everything's an episode of Eastenders with all the drama she creates. Billy Hutchinson... I don't really need to say anything here. Peter, who causes a PR disaster every time he opens his mouth. Nelson McCausland, in the midst of a fucking shitstorm over payments. Edwin Poots, the only man I would gladly watch die over the course of a few years slowly (this man is actually in charge of our health service - a man that doesn't believe in evolution is in charge of a service that will soon be facing a new crisis of superbugs which, by definition, evolve). The list goes on and on and on.

Just because I'm pro-union doesn't mean I'll be voting for a Unionist party, and just because I won't vote for a Unionist party doesn't mean I'm not still classed as a unionist.",0,1407405950,null,0,false,0,cjjdm9v,t3_2cvcsa,t1_cjjdm9v,t3_2cvcsa,null,1435116696,52,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,52

And being a newspaper opinion piece, there were some fairly virulent xenophobic and racist viewpoints, so I guess some need to be taken with a pinch of salt.  

I was interested to see if people had some other ideas as to the cause of this, perceived, or real issue of gentrification. 

My opinion is that £5 for a cappuccino anywhere is a rip off. But in the UK and especially London, housing is at such a premium that to live somewhere that's not totally shit and leaves you with enough money to get something out of the rest of the month, means that invariably people are moving into parts of London that may previously have been considered poor - so for me its far more socio-economic than an immigration or race issue. 

That said it often happens that immigrants and descendants of immigrants are poorer, so have been living in these areas that are in the process of being gentrified for many years, which can give rise to the idea that there's a race or immigration problem. 

Whereas, I think that the affordability - or lack thereof - of essential living costs is the biggest driver of gentrification based tension. ",0,1407406590,null,0,false,0,cjjdqh1,t3_2cvbva,t1_cjjdqh1,t1_cjjdhb8,null,1435116752,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This would happen because banks would be unable to issue letters of credit, and companies would be unable to trust one another, since nobody would know if anyone's money was worth anything or not.  If that had happened, then pretty much all of the food that we import would have ended up sat on a boat somewhere, or just being left in the fields.  Supermarkets would have run out of food within a week or two, maximum, and given that we're not able to produce enough food to feed ourselves, there's probably mass famine and general unpleasantness.

Which is kind of why it would be nice to be able to grow enough food to feed ourselves.  We're far too reliant on global supply chains and complex interconnected systems.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; The point originally made was that as soon as anybody suggest police carry guns... before any evidence has been produced one way or the other.

That's kind of the point though - the generally-agreed-upon chronology for making changes to society (or any system) is:

1. Problem identified
2. Evidence gathered
3. Solution proposed

(With some wiggle-room as to the *order* of 2 and 3, depending on common sense, ideology, etc)

Most people in Britain don't even perceive there to be any 1s of sufficient magnitude to justify the risks posed by increasing the number and availability of guns in society, so - entirely sensibly - 2 and 3 therefore don't even get a look in.

If you want to have a serious debate about gun ownership in society, try pointing to a problem serious enough to justify the introduction and dissemination of deadly weapons.  Something serious and threatening enough that the (inherent and self-evident) risks that come with increasing the prevalence of deadly weapons in society are *still better* than merely putting up with the problem.

With respect, most people don't perceive things like white-collar financial crime, vandalism and general loutishness by a minority of disaffected youths or some fairly localised knife-crime in large inner cities to justify altering the availability of guns in the entire country.

Basically, point to a problem whose consequences are *worse* than the risks of increasing gun availability, and you can have your debate.  Until that point, it's simply irrational to expect people to debate the issue.",0,1407407090,null,0,1407407394,0,cjjdtxf,t3_2crr1n,t1_cjjdtxf,t1_cjjdpuo,null,1435116798,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"There are a few reasons why it might be a good idea to be self sufficient.

There is increaser demand on global food supply due to an increasing population.  At the same time there are several factors which are negativity affecting our ability to produce food. Over-production in some areas is leading to a loss of [fertile land](http://www.ifpri.org/node/8441)	. And climate change is affecting both crop yield and the land area suitable for agriculture. 

Much of the food we eat is produced in countries which can suffer from unrest, in the forms of war and other conflicts. Many of them are also developing countries which are seeking to change the direction of their economy's away from agriculture and towards more profitable industries. Developing countries are also changing their consumption habits. China now imports a huge amount of meat which requires a lot of land to produce, and this demand will continue to increase.  All this will mean even more pressure on global food supply in the future. 

All of this is going to lead to a lot of conflict and competition over food. We have seen this already, such as the conflicts that arise over fishing rights. There will be more and more issues like this in the future.

[The UN](http://rt.com/news/world-food-security-2050-846/) has warned that the world needs to increase it's food production by 60% by 2050 in order to avoid conflicts arising. If we cannot do this, the countries that will be least affected will be the ones which are able to support their populations themselves. The UK currently uses 70% of its land area for agriculture, and we have urbanised 7%, which means we are using up over 3/4 of our land already. It is possible for us to be self sufficient, but it won't be for long.

true,Jaraxo,eng-lincolnshire,Grimsby Area,"1. [Do a search for specific areas you're interested in on this website](http://www.police.co.uk). Unfortunately you can't do an overview, you have to search specific areas.

2. Pretty much any major city has either good high street shopping, or a nearby retail outlet or major shopping centre, so this shouldn't be an issue anywhere.

3. You're looking at your smaller cities, such as York, Durham, Bath, Colchester (I think), Gloucester, Bristol, Lincoln, Lancaster etc...The older Roman cities have a lot of character to them, but unfortunately many clash with your point #4. They are smaller so jobs will be harder, and you'd have to commute to nearby major cities most likely, so York&gt;Leeds/Bradford, Colchester&gt;London, Durham&gt;Newcastle. Of course there are jobs in those cities/towns, but you'd have less choice.

4. Any major city really, though as seen in point 3, you can live out in the sticks or a smaller city/town and still commute. Nowhere is that far apart here really.

5. Again, nowhere is that far from the sea, I think the farthest point in the UK from the sea, around Leicester, is only ~70 miles away as the crow flies. You're never that far away from the sea. The biggest major city on the coast would be somewhere like Newcastle or Liverpool, though even Manchester and London aren't too far away.

6. Again, any major city really, though it all depends what you want. Your student cities such as Leeds, Newcastle, Brighton will have good nightlifes, though as long as you don't go somewhere really small, like Lancaster, there'll be plenty of clubs. Nearly all towns/cities will have your smaller ""local"" feel pubs if that's what you're after.

Other: I've only really talked about cities, but there are plenty of towns or even smaller cities well within commuting distance to job areas if you're prepared to drive for 30-60mins each way.

I've also avoided mentioning the midlands because that doesn't exist; anything south of Sheffield and north of London is very mediocre :D

I also haven't mentioned Sheffield. While it does meet your criteria for nights out and shopping, it doesn't meet the criteria for near the sea, or old/character.  It is however a fantastic city for young people being a major student population, and if nights out and shopping are more important than charm and by the sea, I'd definitely consider it. While it doesn't have the charm of many smaller older cities, as it's history is rooted in the industrial revolution, you're only an hour from many cities that have that charm if you want to visit.

Other factors play a much larger role in the amount of risk to drivers and pedestrians. Not paying attention, not checking your mirrors, not indicating (which is a HUGE problem in this country), using your phone (another big one), driving without lights on in bad weather (nearly every other fucking car on the road does this), tailgating (I'm looking at you, you German saloon driving prick), driving cars with unsafe tyres, brakes and suspension (MOT's don't check for broken shock absorbers for example) are all **WAY** more dangerous than doing 70 in a 60 in good conditions.

This was all explained to me at an AA driver training course by the instructor, and he said speeding in of itself is pretty much the smallest problem on the roads.

But everyone seems to think an easily spotted yellow box which slows down drivers for a few feet is the solution. In villages/residential areas, I agree they are absolutely essential, but on a country lane or the motorway they aren't really protecting anyone.

Secondly I would vote Sinn Fein because of their forward thinking policies on (sex-orientation) equality, their slightly more forward thinking views on abortion than the main unionist parties strictly anti-abortion stance (ie make it legal for the woman to choose in the case of rape, incest, sexual abuse etc). 

I also admire their more socialists ideals and massive push to help the less well off in the country. I don't really care for their pro-united Ireland push, as at the end of the day, the GFA insists that the decision is up to the people of the country, and at the moment the majority are for remaining in the Union.

He's lightning quick and bombs down the right side going forward. He is a very good attacking right back at his age. He struggles defensively sometimes and needs to pick his spots going forward better, a lot of times he gets caught forward and can't track back in time to fulfill his defensive duties.

Which surely leave the reasonable expectation that they are claiming some money for 'supporting' you in finding work.

Surely persisting to make such a claim, in the face of your (repeated) declaration that you are no longer seeking work, looks rather like fraud?

There is an assumption in there (they keep hassling you because they are 'paid' to do so), but that does no seem an unreasonable position to take.

I'm not quite sure where the best place to go with this is - I can't dig out a way to report suspect fraud on that side [0].

On option is to directly ask them about that the next time the call - 'Are they receiving money to keep contacting you?' - and then if not, tell them they are wasting thier own money; and ask to speak to a manager who can stop 'the senseless waste of both our time and money'.

If they are getting money, then ask them for names and address of directors, for the purposes of filing a police report.  And then, quite frankly, I'd contact the police (either in person, or 101 non-emergency line), and file that report of suspected fraud (and continued harassment).

Might be a good idea to take careful note of who you are speaking to.  It makes the person on the other end take notice - don;'t be afraid to ask them for their surname too.

(I have no knowledge if this strategy will be effective; but I think it would count as 'pushing their buttons' - 'Fraud' is 'the F work' when it comes to benefits).

An alternate option is to register for the Telephone Preference Service, and then treat them as if they were unsolicited commercial calls.  I don't know if that would work, but they'd have to demonstrate that they still have a reason to call you, and from what you've said that's not something that'll withstand scrutiny.  Unsure of end points on that - if you _can_ get them found to be unsolicited commercial phone calls, they owe you money for each call (so start logging dates and times).  Just having to defend against those allegations will cost them real money too.

&gt; Today, Great Britain has one of the best road safety records in Europe and the world. Despite massive increases in traffic over the last few decades, the number of people killed on our roads has fallen from around 5,500 per year in the mid 1980s to 1,754 in 2012. However, this still means that around five people die on Britain's roads every day.
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly, driver error remains the most common cause of road accidents.
&gt; 
&gt; Speeding
&gt; Around 400 people a year are killed in crashes in which someone exceeds the speed limit or drives too fast for the conditions.
&gt; 
&gt; Drink Driving
&gt; Around 280 people die a year in crashes in which someone was over the legal drink drive limit.
&gt; 
&gt; Seat Belt Wearing
&gt; Around 300 lives each year could be saved if everyone always wore their seat belt.
&gt; 
&gt; Careless Driving
&gt; Around 300 deaths a year involve someone being ""careless, reckless or in a hurry"", and a further 125 involve ""aggressive driving"".
&gt; 
&gt; At-work
&gt; Around one third of fatal and serious road crashes involve someone who was at work.
&gt; 
&gt; Inexperience
&gt; More than 400 people are killed in crashes involving young car drivers aged 17 to 24 years, every year, including over 150 young drivers, 90 passengers and more than 170 other road users.
&gt; 
&gt; Failed to Look Properly
&gt; 40% of road crashes involve someone who 'failed to look properly'.
&gt; 
&gt; Loss of Control
&gt; One third of fatal crashes involved 'loss of control' of a vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; Failed to Judge Other Person's Path/Speed
&gt; One in five crashes involve a road user failing to judge another person's path or speed.

400 deaths in crashes where someone has exceeded the speed limit vs 300 where someone has been driving carelessly or recklessly (this would be noted when a mobile phone is used).

The Reuters article says that the 8 hrs 40 mins are spent ""using smartphones and tablets, watching television and listening to the radio"". I.e. no laptops or desktops, which I'm guessing still take up most of regular office employees' working hours. Which is also interesting because 8h40m on these types of communication + 8h20m of sleeping leaves only 7 hours for not just socializing, eating/showering, etc but also most of people's actual work. I know there's a lot of pensioners, unemployed and so on, but that seems awfully low..

The [Ofcom summary of the report's findings](http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/news/cmr-2014/) seems less clear-cut on this though. It just says that ""the average UK adult now spends [8h41m] using media or communications"". But wouldn't email on your laptop or desktop, as part of your work for example, also qualify in such a broader category? Further down the page it talks in more detail about people's use of email, and doesn't specify that they're only talking about smartphones and tablets, rather than laptops and desktops.

According to the European Road Safety Observatory:

&gt; [Very strong relationships have been established between speed and accident risk: The general relationship holds for all speeds and all roads, but the rate of increase in accident risk varies with initial speed level and road type. Large speed differences at a road also increase the likelihood of an accident. In addition, drivers driving much faster than the average driver have a higher accident risk](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/wcm/road_safety/erso/knowledge/Content/20_speed/speed_and_accident_risk.htm)

There are also some graphs on that page which clearly show the relationship between speeding and crash rate.

Well, in this instance desired by the people who wish to separate (assuming they'd follow your assertion upon winning).

&gt;If someone opposes the existence of a country then it is hugely hypocritical to try to gain some cheap PR by appearing at an official function celebrating it.

You're suggesting that Scotland doesn't exist if it's in a union?

&gt;I can absolutely guarantee you that US politicians will try to increase their own profile by association with it.

That would probably depend on how well they manage after the event. Nobody is going to be celebrating alongside you if the resulting economy goes downhill, unless they were prepared to help shore it up (which is unlikely).

&gt;I simply feel that anyone who has tried to intervene against it should not be allowed to free-load on it.

Good job nobody is intervening then, isn't it?

&gt;You don't invite the school bully to your birthday party FFS.

A dissenting opinion is bullying, now? (at least, when following that example).

&gt;I'm not calling for an a embargo, simply an un-invitation to any related celebrations.

That's quite a US-style attitude. We don't penalise people that vote for the governing party that loses, so why is it acceptable in this instance? Not everyone was keen on the Good Friday Agreement, but it was for the good of *all*, not just the backers.

&gt;I think it's fair to say that ""yes"" advocates won't be receiving invites

See above. You're voting for the future of the country, not who-gets-the-spoils; the people who want to remain in the union are just as healthily nationalistic as those who want to remain.

To put it another way/ use another example - do you think that all the female redditors that complained about the bra-game and no-makeup-selfies should be barred from treatment based on the research the money those drives provided?

Despite the apocalyptic media narrative surrounding Southampton we still have a good team. Lots of change means it will be an exciting year. 50/50 whether we make it into the top half, too much quality to be flirting with relegation. Koeman will be putting more effort into cup competitions than his predecessor.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for?**

**Wanyama** - In a team full of nice boys with flappy haircuts and tidy technical ability, Big Vic is a necessity. He dominates the middle of the field. The defence found themselves with a lot more work to do when he was sidelined last season. Young and still improving. 

**Tadic** - He'll be the man to make the offence tick. He should be able to replace the former captain's goals, while being a more clinical creative force in the final third.

**McCarthy** - Clyne has a history of niggling injuries which allowed Chambers the chance to show his class last season. This year it looks like Jason McCarthy is the kid in the role of right back understudy. Has been given opportunities in pre-season and has showed bundles of energy.

**3. How do you think the team will line up?**

Clyne - Fonte - Yoshida - Bertrand

Wanyama - Schneiderlin

Tadic - Davis - Ramirez

Yet in the UK they want to ""phone triage"" and tell people to go to Boots and use WebMD. lol

&gt;If it is not an emergency, they will have to wait up to seven days – in some cases even longer – just to be see, and still may only be given a telephone consultation. 

But you need to convince a GP to give you a referral within a ten minute or shorter consultation before you can access any other services on the NHS, yet it's getting to the point where it's a huge struggle to even get that appointment, which is difficult to do while you're sick, and leaves people at home unable to work and unable to see a doctor because it's not ""urgent"", which just leaves them to get worse, preventative care is cheaper than waiting until people get bad.

Home team usually has way too much advantage when playing at home, and the away team is SUPER sluggish and don't respond as well.. Especially if you're playing away and concede a goal. It becomes near impossible to score in that situation. When you're 1v1 vs a full-back and you dodge past him, for some reason he has WAY more speed than you and comes back and tackles you every fucking time.

What I would define as ""too realistic"" would be defenders anticipating my every move based on the way I play. Or not allowing Messi to score from 30 yards with his right foot. Or defenders responding too well to attacking players' movements during corners.",0,1407413847,null,0,false,0,cjjfdbb,t3_2cvc3k,t1_cjjfdbb,t1_cjjevmf,null,1435117604,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

true,[deleted],null,null,"Explaining gentrification is tricky because people really do believe it's a case of poor people in shitty areas who would like them to stay shitty. You also have the racial element where people think ethnic minorities would like it if no other races moved into their area.

I grew up in Deptford, in the borough of Lewisham in the 80's to late 90's. It was and still to some extents is a shot hole. Crime was high. Schools were terrible. Amenities were few and far between.

The BBC aired a documentary two years ago called The Secret History of Our Streets, and in one of the episodes they explored why Deptford was the way it was. Deptford High street was once known as the Oxford Street of South London. The area was actually a well off middle class area. We've all seen those nice big Victorian and Edwardian era houses in areas like Notting Hill that now change hands for no less than three quarters of a million pounds. Well those were all you had in Deptford. Most of them were condemned as slums and razed to the ground. In their place were put those lovely tower blocks every one has come to see as a symbol of the underclass in SE London.

The mostly white working class (in the old sense of the word as in everyone worked!) didn't like these new homes. They couldn't do what they had always done, have a chat over the fence with their next door neighbour or fastidiously clean their doorstep. Mothers couldn't open their front door and call for the kids to come in from 20 floors up. They all eventually moved out. They all settled in places like Grove Park, Petts Wood, Mottingham, or moved into Bermondsey. 

Lewisham were left with a whole lot of homes that *no one* wanted. They inevitably looked to the very end of the housing list...recent Caribbean and African immigrants and the underclass who couldn't be housed elsewhere. Do that for a while and the Deptford/New Cross we all know was born.

So what next? Well then you now have a area full of people who face a lower prospect of being in work. Depending on what side of delusion you want to fall on it was either through lack of jobs, lack of qualification or that pernicious racism. I like to be realistic and combine all three. This isn't a recipe for healthy council tax revenue.

You add these unemployed to the antisocial, and you let them all have kids. You then add in a police force not inclined to be even handed with anyone who seems to be darker than usual. You sprinkle in a school system prone to crushing minority achievement (I was asked if I wouldn't rather be a footballer when I stated my interest in computers as a primary school child...I now run my own IT consultancy and can't kick a ball to save my life) and you have the shitty areas we're all used to.

So, years after creating these social cesspits, you have the ""lowest of the low"" creating art, fashion music and eating food that reflects the culture of the people thrown together in these places. These things prove popular with a certain type of young with it white suburban teenager. The easy access to illicit drugs doesn't do any harm to the attractiveness of these areas either.

Years later those same kids return, but now they're adults and they have money to invest! They open trandy bars and coffee shops, art galleries and clothing boutiques. They tap into the ""urban"" character that attracted them in the first place. They bring with them money and hope. Their mere presence drives up property prices and attracts more like them. The council *love* it! Look at all this tax revenue!

But it's different now.

They want their old uni chums to come too, but they're not going to want to when the people who *live* there are there as well. You notice that despite opening businesses in the heart of these areas the people working in these businesses aren't the same unemployed ones that were there before the business came. I can't help but wonder why in every trendy bar and restaurant between Shorditch,  Hoxton and Dalston I'm regularly served by attractive young white people from Europe and never the kids looking for work from nearby Hackney. The people running these businesses will tell you it's pure coincidence...they didn't apply...when they did they weren't qualified etc. But look around the next time you're in one of those areas. It's sort of striking.

So, you have people who tell you you should be happy they're here. ""We've brought businesses"" they say. ""We're creating jobs"" they yell, but funnily enough these benefits never seem to reach those that live there.

Soon it becomes too expensive to rent or own in the area.

In Lewisham they knew this was coming. While we waited for our rubbish to be picked up or enough teachers to be hired in our schools they instead built the [largest police station in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisham#History). Then the real fun began. The Regeneration Plan. Lewisham started letting companies build [flats no one living in Lewisham could ever afford](http://www.skyscrapernews.com/images/pics/2518PRPsLewishamHousingEstatePlans_pic1.jpg), while knocking down the council flats in their place. Where are the people who lived in them? Who knows. No one cares, but I did see a white woman jogging past the DLR station the other day! She even had an iPhone strapped to her arm! Now that's gentrification.

This isn't a race thing. It's a class thing and the poor white people I grew up with have suffered too. In fact more so. For some reason the people I knew growing up who did the best were not the white kids.",0,1407413877,null,0,false,0,cjjfdm6,t3_2cvbva,t1_cjjfdm6,t3_2cvbva,null,1435117605,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In England and Wales, the offence of ""[rape of a child under 13](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/5)"" is kind of close to the usual definitions of statutory rape as it (a) statutory, (b) covers rape, (c) has no question of consent, and (d) is lacking in defences (other than the 'all-offences' defences such as self-defence).",0,1407414064,null,0,false,0,cjjfflv,t3_2cv6c7,t1_cjjfflv,t1_cjjcva0,null,1435117612,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The term is also used to refer to the [bank regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation) which governs these activities. Know your Customer processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed agents', consultants' or distributors' anti-[bribery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery) compliance. Banks, insurers and [export credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_credit) agencies are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed anti-[corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption) [due diligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence) information, to verify their probity and integrity.

Would really like to Tosin at CB right from the off, to see if he really is made for this level as everyone seems to be saying. Bryan or Maffeo are great replacements too though.

Horsfield would be a great defensive addition to compliment Fofana and Ntcham, but I imagine one of Glendon or Byrne will start instead.

Due to the fact Intima and Bytiqi have been at the youth Euros, I would actually like to see a front three of Hiwula, Cole and Ambrose. We don't have that many wide options now Lopes has moved up too. The likelihood is that we will see either Barker or Boadu instead of Ambrose though.

Lower acceptance rate usually indicates that if people aren't sure about college they put down a famous one, rather than actually being harder.

My advice would be to apply anyway, at the college you'd most like to go to. You should get an interview (with a sensible personal statement - explain your circumstances etc) and they're designed to let the good candidates shine. Do well at interview and weird grades won't matter.

To help your chances, make sure you know your material well, and that you have done plenty of extra reading. A friend doing engineering was asked about things like maximum wind turbine efficiency (search Betz's Law). You're not expected to know about things like that beforehand, but the idea is that with some prompts you can muddle through it, by thinking logically. It's also good if you have an honest answer to ""Which parts of engineering do you most enjoy"" and can talk at length about at least one thing in much more detail (eg robotics) than you might learn at school, to show that you actually like the topic rather than just wanting any old degree - though it sounds like you have that bit covered already.

I use to be vocally against them, and have had two offences to my name (in my defence, both were on quiet dual carriageways with reduced limits, one of them was fixed the other a van hidden up a verge), but now I've 'grown up' a bit I'm less bothered about wanting to put my foot down a bit more.

The *only* problem I have with speed cameras are:

- Regardless of what people think, they are in part to generate money, raking in all of those £60s for people going 35 in a 30.

- Speeding is actually quite low down the ladder in terms of factors causing accidents, yet they're the only major thing that is pushed in terms of accident reduction.

If our drivers were taught better, with more rigid tests, perhaps a mandatory refresher every decade, and some actual motorway driving included in the learning process, our roads would be much more pleasant and safe.

Take a look at pages 5, 6 &amp; 7 of this report: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/9277/rrcgb2011-04.pdf

To summarise; 

- Nearly half of all accidents in 2011 were caused by 'failing to look properly.'

- 'Exceeding the speed limit' didn't even make it into the top 10.

- 'Travelling too fast for the conditions' (basically driving within the speed limit, but too fast for 
rain/sleet/snow/fog/etc) contributed to less than 10% of accidents in the same year.

We need a solid, educational video showing the dangers of bad weather such as fog, rain and snow shown to all learners, we also need basic 'loss of control teaching' through the use of skid-pans and perhaps a bit of testing and education of avoiding hazards and losing control by having to do a course through cones.

However, I think it's worth remembering that last year we signed some great players, who for various reasons (tactics, internal politics, injury) haven't truly made a dent for us yet.

Eriksen proved his worth but was out for so long he didn't really have a full season to exert his influence.  Lamela and Soldado should have better years than last (though that won't be hard).  Capoue I reckon will become a nailed-on starter for us.  Paulinho... well, I'm not his biggest fan by a long stretch, but he could still prove us all wrong.  Any one of these players could give us the X factor of a major signing this season, and don't forget the importance of retaining Lloris and Vert when it looked likely they'd be on their way.

Since the upper echelons of football have become little more than an arms race these days (just look at Barca and Real), I do think we've lacked the kind of signing this year who will strike fear into opponents.  A first choice CB to replace Dawson (I'm not sure MM is that man) and a quick attacker who can play LW and/or second striker would be ideal, but I'm not convinced we'll make those signings.

What frustrates me is this total, absolute focus on speed at the ignorance of all other contributory factors to accidents. There's a junction on the A5 near Atherstone, for example that has a 50mph speed camera coming up to it and yet it still gets collisions regularly with cars pulling out into the main road.

Yes, but this is a dishonest manipulation of statistics. The smaller number of *serious* accidents are being drowned out by the much larger number of minor bumps caused by things like failure to look. In 2011 nearly *one in four* deaths on UK roads were caused by going too fast. Additionally, the proportion of *fatalities* was higher than the proportion of *fatal accidents*, which suggests that these accidents disproportionately cause multiple deaths per crash. That seems pretty damn significant to me.

According to the DfT, 'Failing to Look Properly' was a cause in 49,253 of 118,403 accidents, whereas speeding caused 5,576. Even if you combine this with 'Driving too fast for conditions' which could be 10 miles an hour in snow in a 70 zone, this number comes up to around the 17,000 mark, so not even close to how much damage 'Failing to Look Properly' causes.

We need more education, more rigorous testing and, hopefully, more technology in our cars to 'support' the people who can't seem to pull out at junctions or join a roundabout properly.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"It's a very interesting and clever way of approaching this deal. Liverpool aren't building a team just for next season, BR is trying to build for quite a few seasons. Therefore loaning Falcao makes sense, even if it's a stupid high loan fee. 

If Falcao does arrive on the mentioned loan deal, Liverpool risk very very little. We take over the wages he's got at Monaco, we pay 10mil and basically test run him for a season to see how well he does. Depending on what his season is like and how well he gets on with the team, LFC can finalize the deal before the 15/16 season. If it doesn't work out, thanks for your efforts and hard work, we'll have to go look somewhere else to find a solution.

Another benefit of doing a loan deal like this is that it leaves more money in the transfer chest. Instead of spending it all on a player like Falcao and taking on his wages as well, we spend a smaller portion of it on getting Falcao in for a season and then using the rest of the funds to get in two quality players. Basically, instead of spending 40+mil pounds on Falcao, we spend 10mil on him and maybe get two more 15mil pounds players in.

If you're going to make statements that include silly stuff like 'oppose the existence of a country', which is untrue *and* doesn't further your case, I reserve the right to reply to that.

&gt;Again, straw men don't help either, if anything you continue to devalue the merits of your argument with them.

You introduced the term 'bully' as an example in a thread about another country voicing an opinion. Not sure why replying to that (and using the same example to highlight why it doesn't work) is now a strawman.

&gt;How is not being invited to a party for a moment you opposed ""penalising""?

Because you're then handing out thanks *only* to the people that agreed with you.

&gt;We already do these things

Really? What repercussions were there for the people that voted for separation in the failed 70's referendum?

&gt;Do the Greens attend nuclear power station official openings? 

To fit in with your assertion - have they/ would they move away/ refuse to use any power generated by nuclear once one was built?

&gt;Did any of the old-guard Labour guys try to muscle in on Thatcher's funeral?

[Most of the current bunch did as well as a few of the last lot](http://labourlist.org/2013/04/the-labour-politicians-who-are-attending-thatchers-funeral/). Most of the 'old' guard are dead. But then, we're now outside of the repercussions of a decision.

&gt;Of course not, that would be like banning a ""no"" proponent from Scotland entirely.

But the principal is the same. Agree, or you won't get to join in afterwards.

&gt;It would nonsensical for them to appear at events celebrating those specific campaigns though.

I don't see why - there have been a multitude of decisions (homosexuality, porn, women bishops, the list is very very long) that ministers campaigned against but now celebrate as the right decisions - and why shouldn't they? That's how it's supposed to work, it's a process to work towards the best possible idea for moving forwards, not a fight. The point is that with most choices like this, both sides *believe* in what they stand for, but that doesn't mean they're not allowed to admit that they got it wrong and celebrate achievements with everyone else.

Investment in technology takes a long time to pay off, and we are running out of time. 

The other problem with using these advanced techniques for growing food is the increased cost. It's cheap to plant seeds in a field, much more expensive to invest in the tech and structures needed fro vertical farming, which will be passed on in the cost of food. For many countries, that would be disastrous to the population, making these technologies unusable.  

Many people in the oil industry believe that we have only 40-50 years of cost effective oil production left, and look at all the technological advances that are being done to try and make us less oil dependent.

A uniform comes with a set of expected standards and responsibilities to uphold. In a massive street brawl, for example, it allows you to observe who the ""good guys"" are fighting the ""bad guys"". It allows you to identify if a so called ""good guy"" is not acting ""good"" and therefore report them to their superiors.

Do you support the officers who took off and hid their badge numbers during the London riots? We give officers badge numbers because being in such a position of authority and privilege comes with a responsibility to the public that you are policing. It doesn't really work as well as it should, but being able to identify bad actors gives the ability to prevent the whole force falling into disrepute and retain the public trust.

LB/LB depth has been an issue for a couple seasons...we address it by getting a consistent defensive LB and signing Rose to a long term contract.

Friedel is just about done with his career and we had no other viable experienced options at GK so we get Vorm, who is a GK capable of starting when needed and playing a similar style to Hugo.

We need a CB help and we signed a bright young prospect in Dier, are close to signing Jan to an extension and seem to be progressing a deal for Mussachio who is well suited to Poch's system and gives us the ability to rotate Jan/Vlad/Musacchio and keep the back line structure suited to the style of play.

Seems like we are trying for Schneiderlin who is a pick by Poch and would give us a CM capable of being a strong defensive pivot without sacrificing passing ability.

Seems to be that we are sniffing around LFWs which would help a spot within our squad.

The unmarked cars, officers and cameras act as a brake on people who consider it their ""right"" to ignore the law as long as they won't get caught - they know that even if they can't see the police, there's still a risk of being caught by one who's not visible.

Additionally, what you're referring to isn't the act of 'Exceeding the Speed Limit,' it's 'Driving too fast for conditions' which is an entirely different contributory factor in assessing road collisions. 

&gt; If you can't safely react to changes in environment at your current speed you're going too fast.

I agree to an extent, but I could be doing 80mph on a clear motorway, and suddenly a car pulls into the side of me without looking. Who's at fault?

&gt;PSV Eindhoven winger Memphis Depay has been heavily linked with a move to Tottenham, with estimates on a fee varying between £10m and £16m.


&gt;But the Eredivisie club's technical director Marcel Brands has told De Telegraaf that expects the 20-year-old to stay in the Netherlands.

Britain, as it was, was subject to blackouts and an IMF bailout. We are able to see first hand what happens when that happens in places like Greece today. They come in and enforce reform in exchange for a bailout.

History has glossed over the fact that Wilson closed down more British industry than she did, and under her leadership Manufacturing output rose. These points don't fit the popular narrative. Now, as far as I remember we are top 5 in the world for exports.

If we keep on taking a short term view, jumping from headline to headline, then I think we could find fault in just about everybody, but when we consider where Britain was in 1979 when she took over, the course she left it on, and where we are today, it is difficult to argue anything but the fact that she made tough decisions then for the future, at least not while keeping a straight face.

I think you would hard pressed to find any politician who would deny that the starting fortunes of New Labour were the legacy of an inherited economy from the Tories, who we should remember were brought down over 'sleaze', Europe and general electoral fatigue after such a long period in power.

&gt;

&gt;__Aly Cissokho__ (French pronunciation: ​[ali sisɔko], born 15 September 1987) is a French professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays for [Aston Villa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa). He plays as a [left back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(football\)#Full_back) and has been described as a ""sprightly left-back with good speed and stamina"". 

&gt;Cissokho began his career playing for local clubs within his hometown, such as [Blois Foot 41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blois_Foot_41). In 2004, he signed with professional club [FC Gueugnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Gueugnon) and spent three years in the club's youth system before making his debut in the [2006–07 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Ligue_2). Cissokho spent only one season at the club and, in June 2008, signed with [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal) club [Vitória de Setúbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vit%C3%B3ria_F.C.) in the [Portuguese Liga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Liga). After spending only half the season with the club, Cissokho departed Vitória for the league's [defending champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Portuguese_Liga) [Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Porto). With Porto, Cissokho won the Portuguese [league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Portuguese_Liga) and [cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_of_Portugal_2008%E2%80%9309) [double](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football\)) and played in the [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) for the first time. In July 2009, after a failed transfer attempt to Italian club [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan), he signed a five-year contract with French club Lyon for a fee of €15 million. At the beginning of the 2012-2013 season Cissokho was sold to [Valencia CF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF) and was subsequently loaned to Liverpool F.C. on a season-long loan for the 2013-2014 season. 

&gt;Cissokho is also a [French international](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team) and earned his first call-up to the team in November 2009. He made his senior debut a year later in August 2010 in a [friendly match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_match) against [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_national_football_team).

These types of infrastructural investments are not based on short term views on 'prospective future government spending growth rate cuts'. They will look at demographics, investment environment and long term opportunity.

Off the top of my head, out of the G10 I think I read that we had the slowest recovery from the recession, but now we have the strongest and most sustained. Slowly slowly catchy monkey.

Also we are projected to have the largest economy in the EU by 2020-30, and part of that is directly linked to our expansionary immigration policy over the past decade. 

This is the small slice of a big pie or big slice of a small pie conundrum.

ie. To somebody thinking of investing billions into a transportation network, the thoughts are more about 1)  developed nation, 2) home to one of the few global supercities, 3) expanding population (against developed nation trends), 4) global financial centre of the world, 5) one of the worlds leading judiciaries, 6) unequal distribution of wealth between regions, 6) plans to address that inequality.

To invest here, they know that they are not just investing in a black hole. They have access to finance and are protected by maybe the worlds most respected legal system. They know that there is a growth story to come in the regions outside of London and that so long as they keep their products price competitive, they have an expanding market to trade in.

In the next year or so we will likely come into an unstable global financial environment, financial instruments are providing synthetic returns which are more based on monetary policy than value, government debt is offering terrible yield... We are outside of the Euro too, so the project has currency risk stability which cannot be offered in the continent. Imagine investing in French infrastructure, and theres a huge risk event in Greece, and you find your investment has lost 15% in value just due to the currency.

For yield hungry big business, we present a fantastic investment story as are a nation of contrast that still has a lot of redeveloping work to do but we offer unrivalled systemic stability, access to capital and legal protection at the same time.

It isn't. It could be though.

It is cheaper in the short term to provide security over our food imports, but if we invest in more food technology like Japan is currently, one day we could become self sufficient, or even become a major exporter of food.

The strength of France's farmers show it's still possible for a western country to be self sufficient and a strong economy, admittedly they have more and better land for growing crops, however advances in farming technology is making that less of a limiting factor.

It's a case of short term vs long term gain.

I do however understand we can't invest in everything, so it may be that the return is just too small to become a major food producer in the global market. In which case the economic argument falls apart.

true,the_oncoming_storm,cnty-scotland,The Glorious Kingdom of Fife,"I think in all likelihood a way will be found for Scotland to become a member of the EU on the day it becomes independent.

There are several reasons I think this, ranging from the fact that isn't really in anybody's interests to keep us out, from the disruption if suddenly every EU citizen in Scotland and every Scot in the EU suddenly had no right to be living and working where they are, to the major role of Scottish waters in the common fisheries policies, to Scotland's strategic position, to the fact we already comply with the body of EU law, to the fact that the EU is an expansionist organisation, to the new EU president's statement that he was not referring to Scotland when he spoke of a 5 year hiatus on new members joining.

We could argue about the terms of membership, and the likelihood of retaining the same opt-outs as the UK (keeping membership of the Common Travel Area over Schengen is unlikely to be problematic, even without an opt-out on the Euro, the joining process has voluntary components, there's probably no chance in hell of keeping the rebate), but I don't think membership itself, in principle, will cause us a problem.

I've heard it argued that it would be in the interests of countries with secessionist movements (like Spain) to keep Scotland out, however I expect a much more practical route is to make official a path to EU membership for succession movements where the parent country ""agrees"" to the succession.

In the case of Spain, this would allow Scotland in while allowing Spain to keep fishing in the North Sea rather than destroying their own fishing industry, and Spain doesn't lose any political advantage when considering, say, Catalonia, because the Spanish government doesn't recognise their referendum as legitimate. The comments from the Spanish Foreign minister clearly indicate they'll take their lead from the UK: there's no suggestion of a veto at all.

If the UK government were confident that the EU ruling would prevent Scotland taking up immediate membership, giving them a strong advantage in this debate, they would not have hesitated to ask the EU for an official position on the matter. Their refusal to do so also says a lot.

As for required adoption of the Euro, part of the criteria that must first be met, membership of ERM II, is completely voluntary. There's no way to force a country to join (not to mention all the other criteria that we'd be years away from fulfilling).",1,1407419286,null,0,1407420654,0,cjjha0i,t3_2cvh6c,t1_cjjha0i,t1_cjjh67s,null,1435118603,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Its always been understood that Pepe would not come back to stay. We can't justify keeping two top keepers like chelsea, madrid and bayern can. Not playing him in the preseason is only logical, we just can't risk him getting injured and theres no need to hype him up for a sale(everyone knows his qualities).

true,caeciliusinhorto,Christs,Christ's,"I know that when you are at school, you are always told that you have to get over 90 in *every single module*, first time round in order even to have a chance at getting into Cambridge (or at least my school told me that!) -- fortunately for me, that is simply not true.

Frankly, my AS results were pretty poor -- I took maths a year early, and got an A* in that, but apart from that I got ABC. Fortunately the A was in the subject I now study, but even so that wasn't exactly promising. So messing up one exam is in no way going to sabotage your application.

One thing you should know is that when you apply to Cambridge, you fill in something called the SAQ (supplementary application questionnaire), and one of the questions is, essentially 'is there anything we should know about the provision of teaching in the subjects you took' -- the fact that you didn't have a teacher for much of a term for *three subjects* is extremely relevant here, and will be taken into account.

Onto the questions:

1. If you think you would be good at the tests which some colleges offer (I imagine that some want engineers to do the TSA?) then it might be worthwhile applying to one of those colleges. If you think you would do badly in that sort of test, apply to the colleges which don't ask for it. Sample papers for these tests are probably available online (they certainly are for STEP and the TSA...)

2. Focussing on admissions statistics isn't all that helpful, frankly. In theory, the pooling system means that all candidates have the same chance of getting in no matter where they apply. If you look at Trinity, for instance, the reason it rejects lots of people is because so many apply there -- it physically can't accept all of them. If you look at the stats for Murray Edwards or Robinson, on the other hand, they actually reject a very large proportion of those who apply directly there, and take most of their students from the pool. IIRC, ME takes about 90% of students from the pool -- mostly those rejected from the overapplied-to colleges such as Trinity. Apply to the college you like. Even if there is just one college you *don't* want to go to, apply to another college. There is literally no point in putting in an open application or applying to a college based on admissions statistics.

3. Internships, robotics projects and suchlike are probably the best things you could possibly do as an engineer to make your application stand out.

I'm sorry that you take such offence to brevity. Please mentally replace ""country"" with: ""internationality recognized independent region identified as a distinct entity in political geography"". 

Every single person seemed to know exactly what I meant except you. 

&gt; You introduced the term 'bully' as an example in a thread about another country voicing an opinion.

No, it was a commonplace example of a situation where someone might not be invited to some ""celebration"". Note that the ""bully"" still gets invited to the formal school dance i.e. official functions, no one stops them from taking the school bus or visiting the nurse. I used a party example specificly because it's an informal situation. 

I could have said ""the smelly kid"" instead of the ""bully"" for all the difference it made. But you'd just be accusing me of some other nonsensical claim. Maybe Hillary Clinton *does* smell, I just don't know. 

&gt;  Agree, or you won't get to join in afterwards.

Join **in the otherwise meaningless celebrations**, nothing more. Do Liverpool get invited to a Man U cup winning party? How many examples do you need before this sinks in?

&gt; Because you're then handing out thanks only to the people that agreed with you.

Yes, that is how ""thanks"" works as in ""thank you for your support"". If Scotland votes ""yes"" will we go around saying ""thanks"" to the ""No thanks"" groups? Even though they specifically tell us that they do not desire ""thanks""? 

&gt; that ministers campaigned against but now celebrate as the right decisions - and why shouldn't they?

Because they would by lying populist hypocrites with non-existent levels of integrity. It shows that their decisision making process is simply ""broken"", using popular opinion to determine what is ""right"" and ""wrong"". Personally I want leaders smart enough to come to the correct decision for the right reasons, not because that's what the focus groups are saying. 

Fact is that in most cases their opinion hasn't changed but they know that it's too toxic to share. Simply look at the bible-bashers that claim to be ok with gay weddings, I guarantee you that they'd be straight back on the ""ban it"" train the moment it became publicly acceptable.

true,arselona,null,null,"**Part** of the reason that house prices are inflated stems from the reluctance to build new homes.

Its funny how something as seemingly innocent and charming as the greenbelt can have an effect on the London property market.

Another factor which is exasperating the market is the influx of overseas investors who are looking to keep their money safe, but I would say this is a reaction to the artificial price inflation, which follows the stagnation in property building which has lagged population growth.

Selling council homes was another part of it too, but seems worse now due to the failure of follow up of following governments to provide a new wave of housing to keep up with the huge influx of immigration. 

Had supply kept up with demand, then selling council homes and launching a wave of property ownership would have been heralded as one of the greatest political feats of the last century.

The decision of New Labour to increase immigration (which I support btw), but not invest in new homes, created a lack of supply and wave of demand. This meant that those who bought council homes in the inner city, saw prices continue to inflate and being a landlord became more profitable than climbing the property ladder.

I worked in the pension industry in a past life, and for the life of me - the Defined Benefits format is little more than a ponzi scheme waiting to crash. 

I think the big challenge is getting some of the gatekeepers of public pensions to accept the need to move to let go of their hallowed DB deals, and accept defined contribution structures where people have more individual responsibility for their pensions asset allocation.

The first generation after independence are born to British parents outside the UK, and become British citizens by descent.

The second generation are born outside the UK to parents who are British citizens by descent. Unless their parents have lived in the UK, they don't inherit British citizenship. If they live in the UK for three years as a child, they can gain British citizenship, resetting things to where we started with the generation alive at independence. 

The simplest way to keep dual citizenship going forever would be to make sure to give birth in England every couple of generations. A person born in the UK to a British citizen by descent is a ""full"" British citizen and their children can inherit British citizenship again.

&gt; Tommy Robinson...tweeted a link complaining about mass immigration under Labour – and it turns out that the link was to an anti-Semitic website. It's called The Traitor Within (never a good sign) and after detailing New Labour's nefarious plan to flood the country with good plumbers, it concludes with a paragraph claiming that the ministers involved in its immigration policy ""are all Jewish"".

&gt; Hitler salutes have been seen from day one at EDL marches and static gatherings documented by Hope Not Hate and Searchlight, and have always been brushed aside as being the work of supposed ""UAF infiltrators"" or ""bad eggs"". However, quite often there are great swathes of regular EDLers including ""Regional Officers"" or ROs doing it, sometimes right in-front of the camera. Time-after-time it happens, and time-after-time they repeat the same old line like a broken record ""It's 'onestly not us, Guv'nor. We are not nazis!""

&gt; Everything the EDL do wrong, every anti-social or hate filled activity or gesture, is brushed off as simply as ""over exuberance"", be it overt racism, drug taking, criminal damage, violent punch ups, assaults, or grievous bodily harm of innocent bystanders. After Anders Breivik mass murdered children, hundreds of EDL members including ROs and members of the leadership even, defended Breivik, and yet they tried and tried to pretend they were only joking, when cross-examined by the media.

I didn't. I took offence to your getting upset when your lazy statement was directly addressed, and said as much.

&gt;Please mentally replace ""country"" with: ""internationality recognized independent region identified as a distinct entity in political geography"".

Or alternatively, pay more attention to what you're typing so it doesn't make a statement you didn't intend.

&gt;Every single person seemed to know exactly what I meant except you.

Did they *really*? What do you base that on? I guess you've gotten a few downvotes for some other reason, then (none of them from me).

&gt;no one stops them from taking the school bus or visiting the nurse. I used a party example specificly because it's an informal situation.

OK, you used a bad example with too many unwanted parallels, then.

&gt;But you'd just be accusing me of some other nonsensical claim.

Nonsensical to *you* - I've already highlighted exactly how it was straightforward in the replies, so continue to claim it's nonsensical just demonstrates how you haven't accepted that (which is pretty poor). And a defensible analysis of someone's ill-thought-out statement (*or* bad example) is not a 'claim'.

&gt;Join in the otherwise meaningless celebrations, nothing more. 

Why meaningless? If it's meaningless, why does it matter who attends? Let's try and keep the goalposts where they are, you can't have it both ways. And in any case, I could argue that New Years Eve is ultimately meaningless, but I can't agree that something this significant wouldn't be celebrated regardless of who wins. I'd want to celebrate a decision for the future of my country regardless. We're not all Americans who, when their chosen politician loses, go straight into another four years of campaigning rather than acknowledge defeat. At least, not yet.

&gt;Because they would by lying populist hypocrites with non-existent levels of integrity.

So...if I didn't agree with (say) the Community Charge, and then realise that a) it works and b) is fairer than the old rates system, I'm a lying populist hypocrite with non-existent levels of integrity if I celebrate it as a good decision primarily because it wasn't mine? That's the tar you're brushing with. And the Community Charge was much easier to summarise than something like this. You're giving away too much by judging people to this extreme for not agreeing with you (or more accurately, sticking to their guns regardless), which is arrogant when the subject can be argued either way.

&gt;It shows that their decisision making process is simply ""broken"", using popular opinion to determine what is ""right"" and ""wrong"".

As stated, there is no 100% right or wrong in a decision like this. Both options have advantages and disadvantages, like any election. And again, polarisation of such a debatable subject only works for Jack Ryan.

&gt;Personally I want leaders smart enough to come to the correct decision for the right reasons, not because that's what the focus groups are saying.

You're now confusing someone that panders to the majority with someone that accepts the majority decision and works with that. I want leaders smart enough to never make a wrong decision, but in the real world I'd like a leader that works with the results *regardless*, not pretends they didn't happen for fear of being labelled a lying populist hypocrite with a non-existent level of integrity (example - Millband and Balls pretending they still had financial acumen for several years after the labour election defeat even after the colossal financial disaster that their own party helped to create...or go even further back for the 'longest suicide note in history').

&gt;Simply look at the bible-bashers that claim to be ok with gay weddings, I guarantee you that they'd be straight back on the ""ban it"" train the moment it became publicly acceptable.

But by your assertion, they should be *carrying on* complaining instead of accepting the majority decision, because to do otherwise would be 'populist'. Personally, I'm glad they've accepted change, and I wouldn't demand (going by your example) that they be excluded from celebrating at a gay wedding simply because they didn't automatically agree when it was posited. I could highlight racists that will always be racist regardless of what equality laws are put in place, but that doesn't mean *all* people who were racist previously, or didn't want the Good Friday Agreement, or didn't want the fox hunting ban imposed are all just waiting to have a chance to turn the clock back.

TADA!

&gt; Possibly

nonononno, _definitely_.  

&gt;  but those subsidies exist for a reason. 

yes, its an agreement that was formed between Germany and France. If France agree to buy Germany's industrial output then Germany will help subsidize the ridiculous costs of France's agriculture.  

&gt; More focused on food technology than the rather outdated CAP system though.

I'm down with tech efficiency sure. I'm more into creating technology to help us ramp up production in a worst case scenario as opposed to actually running farms all of the time.

true,MethaneInvestigation,,Strabane,"I voted for Alliance in May. Their whole non-sectarian anti-bigotry stance is what drew me towards them in the end. 

Even though I'm from a liberal Catholic background, it never really entered my head to vote for Sinn Fein. I have to admit to being a bit sceptical of their motives regarding some of their liberal policies. I just think that their pro-choice stances are a reflection of the way Northern Irish society is going to go in the next generation, so a few years down the line they can paint themselves as the progressive voice in Northern Irish politics. Admittedly, they are very good at playing the political game and saying all the right things when it suits, but I struggle to believe they are entirely sincere, even as some of their members are probably rather faithful Catholics.

And it would never occur to me to vote for any unionist party. They're all full of bigoted, bitter religious lunatics who scream ""what about ussuns???!!"" every 5 minutes, and would rather see the place burn to the ground before supporting issues like gay marriage and abortion. Also the pandering to the militant loyalists puts you off them for ever.

For the most part, I like the Green Party's politics, but there are some things like the pro-homeopathic treatment bullshit that I can't get my head around. But those black marks are very minor compared to the unionist parties. I was also optimistic about NI 21 before they collapsed under the weight of Basil McCrea's arsehole, and I think that implosion has sadly set back the non-sectarian cause a good few years.

I think I should state too that I am pro-union only for economic reasons, and would be totally indifferent to a united Ireland if I woke up tomorrow to that state of affairs (imagine the stink all the fleggers would make out of that, though!).

That's a shame, I don't know why you would be. I always recommend test riding as many bikes as possible to ensure you get what you want.

As for potential dangers, not everybody has insurance allowing them to ride other people's bikes, which would mean what you're doing is illegal. Not *that* dangerous, but getting pulled over for something minor could become a big deal. Someone could crash your bike riding it like an idiot, or through unfamiliarity, or through bad luck, and the same could happen to you which means having to buy someone a new bike. Ultimately, as said in another comment, someone could get on your bike and never come back, leaving you with a junker or something they stole.

If you want to talk to someone involved in admissions then email admissions@cam.ac.uk. There is no way in which talking to the people on the end of that email will prejudice your application.

Even better, your school can ask to have someone directly come from the University and talk to everyone about the admissions process and answer any questions you have face-to-face. **The University does not charge your school for this.** If there isn't anyone available to come to your school, the University should be running access events in your area: the University divides up the country into regions and shares work amongst the colleges.

Tips:

* Does your festival have a Hare Krishna tent? If so, plan to eat at least one meal per day there.

* Are you sure you don't want to bring a small camping stove and saucepan? There's nothing like the smell of fried bacon in the morning, or even hot baked beans instead of cold stuff. The one in decathlon is small and only £12 (with gas). Or you could borrow one from a friend?

* Tinned food (remember the can opener, get one with a bottle opener too to make friends!!!) eg tuna, baked beans, beans and sausage, corned beef...etc. Remember to bring tinned fruit (in water or juice so you can drink that too - the peach one tastes great with gin but the hangover is awful) and vegetables to get some Vit C. The downer is that this stuff weighs a ton. 

* This stuff from [Look What We Found](http://www.lookwhatwefound.co.uk/) can be eaten cold, much lighter weight than tins and is tasty as hell!

* If you bring a burner, you can add tinned or cuppa soups to the list to add variety.

* Don't laugh - Baby food!! Ella's kitchen brand comes in pouches in great flavours, tastes pretty good and you can eat it on the go as their squishy packs means no cultlery. The good thing about these is that it's packed with nutrients.

EDIT: [Found it](http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=11320501) (@18:45), and I misquoted Keller, but the point remains. If you can't view the video, the quote is:

**""If you look at what Tottenham has done over the last 10-12 years, it's a shotgun approach of how they're buying players. They're just grabbing a bunch of players, hoping that some work out. If they don't, we'll just loan them out or let them languish in the reserves for a while until their contract is up.""**

^  Levy has never been one to let a young player's contract run out and let him go for free. I can't think of a player Levy has spent money on, then given up on. Maybe Zeki, Pienaar, and Khumalo.

Yes there are countless inquiries and scouting that happens across the world, but information rarely stays confidential. I'm not talking about whistleblowers, but the simple act of gossiping starts with someone saying something and anothers sharing it and someone finally putting it together. Say someone at the club works in transportation, orders Ayre tickets to travel to Italy. They then have relationship with other staff members who are in lower positions, maybe they have kids who are crazy about Liverpool and they share bits of anything they hear (nothing big, Ayre is supposedly going to Italy) now the kid has a parent that works for Liverpool and shares everything he hears. This kid (one of those ITK guys with huge twitter following was once a kid that started college after the summer and revealed his BS) has twitter and posts something, someone else picks it up and so on. 


Now for the vast majority of the time, they will see that Liverpool has lot of money and lacks a striker and start posting anything that might turn out to be true, but I don't like the idea of believing the club ""leaks"" what it wants. Plenty of shit leaks from clubs from the most unexpected sources. Information will always find a way to move to bigger stage whether by choice or not, all it takes is for BR to go after Allen to be linked with Swansea players after that then why not Gylfi and Borini who he also coached. Most people do not have a clear idea of the information they receive, it's only when it's traveled to bigger circles that someone finally connects the dots.


And the above is not accounting for the staffs of taxis, planes, airports, agents, close family and agents revealing information.

Germany: Political and economic leader of Europe. Merkel is probably the best leader in Europe (but that's not saying much) Everything works properly and they seem to be doing things right unlike us. People are nice - guys are awesome and girls are a bit crazy but all right. 

Denmark: Borgen! Small, clean, pleasant, everyone speaks English.

Poland: The leader of New Europe and will take Italy's place in terms of power in Europe/EU. Polish is the second most spoken language in the country now. Good beer.

Czech Republic: Great beer! Also porn

Austria: Mini Germany, Mozart and Sound of Music. They're just not on the radar.

Switzerland: Crazy expensive and beautiful but dull. 

France: Our bros! Amazing history, culture, and food. Their politics is a bit screwy now - Hollande is probably the most pathetic leader in Europe and their economy isn't looking too hot. A lot of French people seem to come over here now but if I could swap with them and live in Paris I would.

Luxembourg: Small and insignificant

Belgium: Beer, waffles, chocolate, In Bruges and Poirot. I'm always amazed they haven't split up and joined France/Netherlands.

Netherlands: As nice as Scandinavia and Germany but more laid back. The nicest people you could meet and they all speak English which is a plus but they make me feel like a midget. Consistently punch above their weight. Gutted they didn't make the final.

Sweden: Wallander, vodka, Stieg Larsson. Don't know much about them but I know I want to visit (if I could afford it)

Russia: Strange place. I don't think Putin is ever going to step down so that is going to be interesting to watch. 

Ukraine: It's a bit of a mess and we shouldn't get involved

Balkans: N/A

Spain: Holiday destination of choice for us. People aren't great at speaking English compared to other countries. Never been and don't have an urge to go.

Can't believe you missed out Ireland! Lots of Irish people over here and apart from some differences in lingo we're pretty much the same people - negative and sarcastic attitude and we love to drink!

And there are larger supermarkets here from ""the big three"" that are more like wal\*mart stores in that they sell groceries, clothing, electronic equipment, bedding, etc. I don't think any of them go into outdoors gear etc and they definitely do not sell firearms, but some of them are pretty massive and on a par with any wal\*mart.",0,1407432216,null,0,1407432588,0,cjjnzx3,t3_2cr7uh,t1_cjjnzx3,t1_cjjntrs,null,1435121786,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

It happens guys, and I wouldn't worry too much over a single bad performance. He hardly ever led the line as a the lone striker for PSG. Third, his play from Uruguay should never be taken into account. Uruguay have a very strict (I hate it) defense first philosophy. They have a pretty bad midfield, and Cavani hardly gets any service. Look up goals scored by Uruguay and you will see that a majority of them will be off a set piece or a counter attack that requires clinical finishing. I've followed his career since his Palermo days, and he is world class in the right system. 

The only problem I see is similar to the PSG situation in which you already have an excellent striker for the team that only uses one striker in their preferred formation. That's the only reason I can see this move not being advantageous for both sides. Why shell out a bunch of money for a player who will be played out of position or benched regularly?

A person collecting the info doesn't want to fill out 100 questions. That will just put people off from tagging. Best solution to get people to tag your toilets would be to use GPS photo tagging or direct GPS data.

* Take pic or get GPS.

* Select opening times like ""business opening hours""(people aren't stupid), 24hour or ""user input""

* Select if 100% public, customer only, customer access

* If pic has no gps attached or you can't access GPS, ask user to input location or turn on gps


Keep it simple. There is no need for a floor number, how clean the toilets are etc... You need to find a toilet and quick. You are going to have to rely on people to collect toilet data too. Keep it simple for them. Couple of clicks maximum.

Also consider tagging toilets online without the app. People can do it from home then too. (run a web app on a server to submit, just like the phone app)

Once the toilets are geographically tagged and with basic access info, you can work on detailed descriptions like if the toilet has imperial leather soap.

Austria: Not really on the radar apart from creepy people who build torture dungeons in basements.

Switzerland: Cant hear the rest of europe over the noise of mountains and piles of hidden gold.

France: The nation everyone loves to hate. Overly fond of burning things to the ground (namely cows) and striking at the drop of a hat. Its a poor stereotype, but I have only met one french national who wasnt stuck up their arse with how much better France was better than anywhere else.

Luxembourg: Erm. I know it exists. 

Belgium: I also know this place exists and has chocolate. 

Netherlands: Very nice and laid back people. Fond of cycling.

Sweden: Like Denmark but larger. An incredibly idealistic yet cynical young generation of people at the minute.

Norway: Very clean, very green. I guess the overwhelming impression I've had from my extensive time there (my fiancee is Norwegian) is that generally everyone just wants to be left alone to get on with their own quiet lives in peace which is a sentiment I can get behind. In common with Denmark and Sweden, an unhealthy obsession with liquorice. 

Italy: Similar to Swedes, the italians I've across are torn between being idealistic but have an incredible hatred of the corruption in politics and nepotism that has caused them to have no option (in my friends words) to emigrate to try and make their way in the world because they arent the son/cousin/nephew of some politician or business owner. Otherwise italy doesnt generally register beyond ""country, fucked because of corruption and nepotism, basket case"".

Russia: I wouldn't trust any of these twisted bastards as far as I could throw them. They play the international politics game as though the cold war is still going on in an incredibly machiavellian way, and that makes them incredibly dangerous. 

Poland: A country that has really come into its own after being absolutely raped (and I use that word without exaggeration) after the second world war and bloomed once the EU really got going in the late 90's/00's. Typically hardworking, blunt and straightforward which makes a refreshing change from a lot of other nationalities and other brits who dress things up with politeness.

Ukraine: Basket case at the minute. Probably fucked for the next decade at least.

Balkans: Similar to Poland in a lot of ways. I generally dont know enough to distinguish them, but a lot of romanians I've come across are like a dialled-up-to-eleven version of poles. Very hard working and very, very blunt.

Spain: Cheap holiday and retirement destination. 

Ireland: Imploded economy with people emigrating like rats leaving a sinking ship.",1,1407433643,null,0,1407435474,0,cjjou7v,t3_2cw62q,t1_cjjou7v,t3_2cw62q,null,1435122173,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

As far as the courses go the material is great and makes things quite easy to understand. If you're struggling there is plenty of online support be it from your tutor or the forums. A word of warning though, don't spend too much time on the forums as some people just love to whine and it can start to sap your morale. You start to see problems with things you previously had no problem with. The only modules I really struggled with were the maths modules as it is very difficult (or at least I thought so) to learn maths from written material. It can only teach you one way and if you don't get it you're stuck. The maths modules were the only ones I felt it necessary to attend the tutorials (I also used khan academy a lot!).

The summer schools are fun and give you a taste of campus life I guess. They're not exactly difficult and you get to do plenty of practical fun stuff. For engineering we did things like build bridges, analyse chocolate composition (involved eating chocolate) road traffic theory and others I don't remember. They're a nice break from the written stuff and easy points.

In all, it was hard work. There is always the next assignment looming in the back of your mind, and doing it alongside full time work it took me nearly 8 years. But the feeling at the award ceremony when they called my name...wow. I would do it all again in a heart beat.

I am not excusing arseholery, but if I drive a fast car and you are in the outside lane and I want to get past, what would most people suggest I do? Because I hear a lot of people complain about tailgating from bimmers and Audis, but would you prefer they flash you? Undertake you? Maybe they're just driving close to say get out of the way as you're too slow. If it's a single lane road, well then they're cunts but tailgating is not always that bad in my eyes.

Disclaimer: I don't tailgate as I'm paranoid about people slamming their brakes on, I don't flash as I think it's the height of bad manners and very aggressive but occasionally if someone is being really slow in the outside lane of an *empty* motorway and they haven't had the decency to move across after a minute or two, I might undertake but give them a lot of room. If we drove more like the Germans, as opposed to just moaning about drivers of German cars, many problems would be avoided as lane discipline is so much better.

I think this is one of the more 'realistic' targets, not because of price or because we are particularly close to getting him, but realistic in the sense that he could actually eventually want to come to Liverpool. If the claims are true that he says he'd love to play in England, I'm sure one of the first people he will call about the decision is Suarez. They're from the same boyhood town and it seems like they're close based on what I saw in the WC. 

That being said, despite the way he left, Suarez has a place in his heart for LFC and I'm sure he'll have good things to say about the club, life in Liverpool and most importantly Brendan Rodgers. I'm sure that they'd talk about BR's philosophy and what he does to get the best out of the player and what could bring Cavani out of this 'rut' at PSG (compared to his Napoli days) and really bring him into a world class position.

true,OptioMkIX,,Hang Parliament,"I think generally the problems with prisons can be summarised (as much as anything as complicated as this can) as having two root causes: lack of money and ideological problems.

The lack of money is pretty simply explained. The current government in particular and governments in general dont like to be seen spending money on convicts, in large part because of the second cause, which is the prevalent opinion that prison should primarily be about punishment instead of rehabilitation.

The punishment is already a given. But the aggressive lack of rehabilitation, whether thats by design or accident, robs convicts of the ability to get out of the cycle. 

What the hell is a convict whose just come out of prison supposed to do if he has no qualifications to speak of and no friends or family to support him? Its pretty easy to conclude that returning to a life of crime is the easy option. If that guy got a degree, diploma or certificate while inside, then his options open up a lot.

And thats before you start getting into things like Cameron wanting to rescind prisoners their right to vote while inside. How is somebody supposed to relate to society once they get out if that society has fundamentally ostracised them?

All the commemoration going on rigth now about your glorious fight in WW1 seems to be a steady self-assuring of your political and social ""weigth"" in the world deriving from past glory. The Empire - has passed. Accept that.

For me, this is always an indicator that the person commenting remains ignorant to truly understanding life in Britain.

WW1 was a pivotal moment in British history. The focus is largely on all the people who lost their lives. We remember it because many people still living had parents/grandparents that fought in that war and the commemoration deserves to continue. 

I keep hearing complaints that we are celebrating our victory in the first world war, yet this seems to be something people say rather than something that actually happens. I remember Paxman making a big song and dance over a comment Cameron made, taken completely out of context. People wait eagerly in anticipation with the objection ""WE SHOULDN'T BE CELEBRATING IT! THIS WAS A WAR WAGED BY ARISTOCRATS THAT KILLED MILLIONS OF INNOCENTS""! This sentiment is not something novel and I wish people would stop espousing it as such.

The average person in Britain knows little to nothing about the empire. The average state school hardly mentions it at all (aside from ww1 and ww2) in their history lessons. It seems to me this German in question considers scepticism towards a large bureaucratic government that we haven't truly ever voted for as indication of ambitions of former glory.

Denmark - No idea. 

Poland - One of our old allies and pound for pound the best immigrants come from Poland. Probably the country that suffered the worst during the 20th century; a cause of regret for us.


Czech - No idea! Seen some lovely photos of Prague though. Also they have gun rights. That's cool.


Austria - Lovely people! Beautiful mountains. Well working society, nice trains! It's like an oasis in the mountains.


Switzerland - Much respect for the way they do politics. Outside of the EU they are neutral, independant, rich, free, democratic. Meanwhile meek people in this country say we couldn't do even better than they do on the outside.


France - Great for holidays. Ironically, I've found French people are cold and not welcoming. Great food. Paris is nice. But again, the people can be right knobheads. Other than that, it's Europe's home of industrial subsidies and strikes.


Luxembourg - No idea


Belgium - No idea


Netherlands - How Amsterdam seems to still be the only place in Europe with hookers and weed is beyond me. Liberal, welcoming country, our old cousins.


Sweden  (Norway too?) - Crazy blond bastards. Gave the world much great metal. Best women in Europe. Eurosceptic like us.


Russia - Brilliant, tough, proud, warm people who've been duped by a backwards, bullying arse.


Ukraine - No idea. Wish them the best of luck in their current situation with Russia. I've wanted to visit Ukraine for a while.

Walker's career could go four ways at least two of them mean we need a replacement:

1.) He regains the form that made him one of the best RB's in the EPL and some team comes in with a big money offer (especially because he is English), here DeAndre yedlin could be useful

2.) He keeps having injuries every year (Like sandro :( ) and we need a talented replacement for the inevitable 2-4 months we don't have him, Here DeAndre Yedlin could be useful (though not for a few years, as right now he is NOT an EPL FB and maybe not even an upper championship side FB)

3.) he doesn't get demonstrably better and by the time he is 26-28 people start clamoring for him to be replaced (a la Aaron Lennon), here DeAndre Yedlin could potentially be useful.

4.) He becomes one of the best RBs in the EPL and is actually Spurs through and through and doesn't leave (least likely imo)


I honestly think that #3 is the most likely. 5 years ago Lennon was a key cog in the team that got to the Champions League using his pace to get to the touchline and beat defenders. Now no one wants him around (I do, love the little man!) and he is only 27! hell people wanted him gone last year and he was only 26! I think it's mostly that people want what ever new signing may come because Aaron Lennon is the player that has been here forever and been good sometimes great.

Walker is 24 and could easily fall into the problem of just starting to become stale to Tottenham fans/management. It's common knowledge he relies very much on his pace (like Lennon does/did) and is much better going forward then back and, while he has improved his defending, he still to often has to rely on his speed to make up for flaws in other parts of his game.

The end point being I could very easily see a time within 2-4 years where Yedlin or some other RB could push Walker out of the lineup or that we need I high level back up for his inevitable injuries (like Spurs needed with King). 

Having said all this, Walker is clearly #1, Yedlin would be #3 behind Naughts at this point in time. I think Yedlin is way overrated by USA fans in this sub (don't get me wrong I will totally get a Yedlin jersey) based on sub appearances in the WC. But, in 2-3 years after maybe a championship and then a lower level EPL loan (like what Walker did) he could be 23 and ready to start for Spurs.

Coincidentally I was living in New York at the time and after watching it on C-span I asked a couple of legal bods what they thought. They (and the more rational media in general) had a very different take then what I saw in our media.

They have a oft repeated maxim over there (which isn't that known over here) which is 'we are a nation of laws, not of men' - which sounds typically 'Merica' but boils down to in the legal world it matters not one whit if you give a 'Mr Deeds goes to Washington' amazing grand-standing, emotive speech in court (hence why it's a popular trope in films and TV but rarely occurs in real life) the case will ultimately rest on the evidence provided and the interpretation of the law.    

I seem to recall Galloway wasn't mocked as such but was more called out for his grandiose show-boating which was seen as trivialising the nature of what was being investigated. 

They were especially bemused as he was seen as being someone who had a position of authority in the British political system from whom they were more used to seeing respect, if not for the individuals involved but at least for the institutions and citizens they represented. The 'you salute the rank not the Officer' thing.  

I think the term 'blowhard' was used quite a bit, again one of those words that isn't really used over here.

I'm not really making a judgement just thought it was really interesting to see the event from both a British and American perspective.

Summary

Some initial results from the recently conducted Northern Ireland Fertility Survey are examined with particular reference to the relationship between family size and religious denomination. While the overall average family size of Roman Catholics is still larger than that of non-Catholics, the extent of this differential is now narrowing as a result of the more rapid recent decline in the average size of Catholic families. In addition, there are variations in family size among the main Protestant denominations; a broad regional dimension to the Catholic-non-Catholic differential is also apparent. Although subsequent analyses will document these trends in greater detail, some of the main hypothesized explanatory variables are briefly discussed along with some of the socioeconomic and political implications of these recent trends.

Which bit of ""immediately taken down [...] grovelling apology [...] ""damnable and ignorant"" [...] blatant breach of editorial guidelines"" are you not getting? The *Times* specifically **denied** that writer the opportunity to publish that piece on their website.

You are also aware, of course, that the writer himself is [not even Israeli](http://www.ibtimes.com/who-yochanan-gordon-when-genocide-permissible-writer-took-cues-father-5-towns-jewish-times-1646520), which does put rather a dent in your conclusion that the admitted lunacy of his writing demonstrates the uniform racism of Israeli society, of which he is **not a member**...

&gt;And Israel may be a signatory to the Convention Against Discrimination In Education but that doesn't stop them from spending b one and a half times as much on the education of Jews as it does on Arabs.

Well, it's *supposed* to stop them from doing that. Education in Israel isn't flawless and may very well suffer discriminatory funding, though of course the fact that this is reported at all, not to mention the subject of interventions and attempted remedies from the Department of Education, is several orders of magnitude better than parallel systems in neighbouring countries. You have to admit that the charge of 'discriminatory spending in education' is not quite as severe as the other charges you're levying against the State.

Are you on drugs? Israel has by far the most developed legal system in the Middle East and arguably one of the most strictly enforced anywhere. Please, tell me more about how the law in Israel doesn't mean anything but still requires the highest number of lawyers per capita *anywhere in the world*.

Businesses in what remains of the UK will not have to pay to exchange currency when they trade with Scotland saving hundreds of millions in transaction costs every year, this obviously applies to tourists/visitors too.

The UK will be saddled with an extra £140bn of debt if a currency union is not agreed as the debts accrued by the UK are the successor state's to deal with. With the negotiation of a currency union Scotland would take on its share of the national debt. 

Ultimately bailing out the banks costs less than that since you get to recoup some of the money eventually (i.e the treasury breaking even (almost) on the recent sales of some of its Lloyds shares) rather than taking on extra debt and also having an increase in the rate at which new debt was taken on (in the short term) whilst having to deal with a significant loss in income. This would effect the UK's balance of payments and could potentially cause even greater austerity for the UK. It could also weaken the pound sterling as it loses North Sea oil and gas from its portfolio. 

Even if Scotland does use a different currency, if you take RBS as an example, most of RBS Group's investment banking operation is based in London and most of its retail customers are in England and it is owned by the UK government (for the time being). Due to these factors the UK would still take responsibility for most of the bailout, the bank's HQ is not the only factor of who is and is not responsible. Cross border bailouts happened with Fortis and Dexia bank in France and the Benelux so there is form for that sort of thing.

I'd say taking on £140bn worth of debt (£2300 for every man women and child in England, Wales and NI) after taking a near 10% cut in income just because you might have to bail out a bank at some unspecified point in the future (and would likely still have to even if Scotland uses a different currency) isn't the smartest idea.

Yes, UAF, and especially groups like antifa, have thugs looking for a fight, but they're going to counter-protest. Not only are there plenty of members of UAF who aren't looking for a fight, or looking to stoke up tensions and cause disruption (can't necessarily say the same about antifa mind), but UAF aren't the ones organising the protests, the EDL are. The EDL are the ones going out of their way to target areas like Tower Hamlets and Brighton to do their hate filled rallies.

[Here is a Squawka comparison](http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#ligue_1/2013/2014/ezequiel_lavezzi/118/58/1313/0/p|premier_league/2013/2014/adam_lallana/64/64/723/43/p|premier_league/2013/2014/raheem_sterling/126/64/534/0/p|premier_league/2013/2014/rickie_lambert/64/64/727/43/p|premier_league/2013/2014/philippe_coutinho/126/64/2673/0/p#goals_scored/key_passes/assists/chances_created#90) between the players listed and a few important offensive categories. While he is behind on most of them, goals aside, he is not that far off. With his minutes played being 350, 450, 840 and 1200 less than Sterling, Coutinho, Lambert and Lallana, respectively, I think it's safe to say his numbers would be better if he had received more playing time and more starts.

Further, his numbers [in the Champions League](http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#champions_league/2013/2014/ezequiel_lavezzi/81/81/1313/0/p#goals_scored/key_passes/assists/chances_created#90) are decent, and further supports his historical numbers.

In any case, Lavezzi isn't the type of player you get really excited about, in my opinion. At this point in his career he is a Kuyt-like contributor.

From the outside looking in I imagine that for want of a better word, it looks incredibly crass. And I guess that its a view that I share somewhat. 

Instead of being sombrely reflectful of the lives that were lost, a lot of the things in the news have been incredibly flash and showy. A large number of temporary poppies. A similarly temporary (and intangible) pillar of light?

They simply dont have the same kind of quiet, sombre gravitas as other stone war memorials, which was entirely the point of the memorials at the time, to remember without making the error of glorifying war or being overly showy. The point of those memorials was to be quietly, sombrely imposing to always be present in the national consciousness. I sincerely doubt that in thirty years time anyone is going to seriously remember a bunch of fake poppies at the Tower of London alongside the Cenotaph or Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Then theres the other side of the coin which is that this is happening on the 100th anniversary of the *eve* of the war, instead of at the 100th anniversary of its *end*. Its a subtle but important difference that I'm sure that our european cousins have picked up on.

If we move onto

&gt;Generic obsession with past

Then I'm afraid our euro cousins have a point. As an example with the world cup, how many commentators made reference to a march of glory like in 1966? Hearkening back to a lucky victory that occurred half a century ago is not exactly the behaviour of a nation that is forward looking. 

And its not just football. Its things like the way that the UK throws its weight around on the european stage as though it was still a superpower. We're a power to be sure, but not super by any stretch of the imagination. Our star has been firmly eclipsed by the US and we are no longer the best. We are among the best of the rest, but the amount of people who believe the UK can go it alone are simply living in a fantasy world.

&gt; An authentic and definitely rural local tucked away in the depths of the Shropshire Hills country.

There's also a separate pool room. Outside, there's a pleasant lawn with tables, together with a covered and heated shelter for smokers. The pub is the starting point for Walk No. 5 in the ""Walking with Offa"" series. 

&gt;This confirms that it's one of those places that are close to the Welsh border, which in these parts follows a tortuous and seemingly illogical course. Indeed, you can travel east from here and get to the nearest Welsh village. Also, stroll down the lane across the road and the frontier is crossed.

b) Germany-specific: we think they give a flying fuck that we beat them in two world wars. The notion as holding this up as some kind of badge of honour is strange and perhaps quite offensive to many Germans. Witness the very different ways we are approaching the 100th anniversary of WWI.

(This by the way is in reference to the UK government and establishment, as is usually the case with these questions like this, most Europeans seem to be quite positive about the Brits as a people. Apart from those who live in the countries/areas where we like to go drinking)

true,Snofflewaffle,lfc12,,"That's a horrible growing feeling I've been having for a while too. I hate united, absolutely hate them, but all this talk of ""Well they won't be able to sign anyone because they don't have CL!"" is bollocks. Look at the wages they can throw at players. And their reputation means they can throw it at the right players to get them into the top 4.

Van Gaal is obviously a massive step up from Moyes. He plays much better football, in a much more 'united' way. At time last season united were pitiful. Van Gaal looks like he's gonna shape that squad and give them purpose. He did pretty bloody well at the World Cup with an alright Netherlands team which relied on their attack. That's sort of the position united are in. Their defenders aren't great, their midfield is pretty poor (Herrera looks like the only thing he can do is foul people, yes I'm basing this off one game) but their attack (as much as it pains me to say it) is pretty fucking good.

I could see City maybe having a bit of a hangover season from their win last year, and perhaps they might try and go all out in the CL, so I think you're right that they won't win it. Chelsea pretty much have to win, they've strengthened very sensibly, and if Mourinho doesn't get a trophy this year, I think that's 3 years without silverware. Abramovich looks like he's going to afford Mourinho a bit more time (I think he would have sacked anyone else if they would have finished 3rd like that), but even his patience will be tested if Mourinho doesn't win a trophy this year.

  Arsenal have strengthened as well. For a few years they've looked like they need one good striker and that will solve their problems. Is Alexis Sanchez going to improve their strike force that much? I don't think so. I think if Arsenal get a new DM then they're in with a shout for the title. Top 4 is the minimum for them though.

  And then tacked on to the end we have Spurs. The ones who seemingly wasted all that Bale money on players who got injured... What happens when they come back to fitness and have had a year of at least being around each other. They also had AVB and possibly the worst manager in the league last year. Pochettino could be a game changer.

Comparison sites will give you a good idea of what you are looking at. If there is an insurer you prefer it's always worth calling them up and telling them you got a lower quote else where and asking if they can beat it. More often than not, they can't, but they will sometimes throw in extras to make their offer more appealing, or give you discounts on extra cover.

I know calling up is a total nightmare most of the time, and you always get the hard sell on other stuff, but it really is the best way if you know an insurer you prefer.

Don't be afraid to ask for a reference number and tell them you are going to think about it, or check else where. This may also get you a better offer if they think they can make the sale.

3rd, 3rd-F/T, isn't always the cheapest, make sure you check for comprehensive quotes too.

WWI in this country is held up as a time when people gave their lives for our liberties etc. and there is a twinge of nostalgic nationalism and pride, not in the sense of being jingoistic, but more that we elide it far too much with our experience in WWII.

I'll have to try and find some sources that agree with me, but I remember reading something about how much more prominent remembrance and poppies etc. have become in this country in recent years.

She didn't have the option herself, but I was kinda impressed that Adam Hills kept his missing foot a secret for years until he felt he had established himself on the circuit, as he feared if it got out, he'd just be the 'one foot guy' in comedy, pulled in whenever they needed that.

I also agree that so many of us are unhappy in ourselves, and we aspire to unrealistic goals.

I can understand the disillusionment with politics in this country at the moment. It really is a shame because we could have some really strong ***good*** leaders in charge with some really world beating ideas. Instead we get stuck with the same boneheads each and every election. None of the ideas are original and Westminster just circlejerks the whole time.

The most frustrating thing is, it won't change. The big parties have no intention of changing, no incentive to do so. I think the worst part is people who vote for a party because they always have. I have a member of my family who votes conservative and gets such a hard on over anything conservative does, not because it's good but because it's conservative. Getting Gove out of education was one of the smartest things Cameron has ever done imho, the bloke was a tosser. Yet this particular family member thought he was the best thing since sliced bread. Again, not because anything he was doing was actually doing any good, schools are getting worse, but because it was Conservative.

In my opinion, it's those people who are doing more damage than the ones who abstain from voting. They encourage the idiocy of those in government.

He uses the TARDIS to run away and help, rarely to fight - if you notice, the Doctor almost always solves the problem after leaving the TARDIS. The only problems he directly solves with the TARDIS are the ones that can ONLY be solved by the TARDIS, like towing an entire planet, or withstanding the gravitational pull of a black hole, or moving through time.

He's able to ""cheat death"", yet he's as afraid of it as anyone else. He ages slowly, true, but many other races in the universe do too. And his real super-power, at least when comparing to humans, is his intellect. I think it's fair to say that we are to apes as time-lords are to humans, when it comes to intelligence and brain-power.

I think that's quite refreshing, in fairness. If we had more folk getting involved in politics because of causes they feel passionate about and affect their lives significantly, then they should be welcomed into the political sphere as enthusiastically as possible.

A knock-on effect from having loads of career politicians is that so many of their offspring will go into the political scene for the same motive as their parents, which eventually creates a political class, similar to what's happened in British politics.

Give me a bunch of activist whippersnappers who lack a little political acumen any day over characterless suits who are only in it to advance their own standing.

&gt; The shinners look after their own very well, if you're outside that, you'll not get any favours from them.

What do the Muslim populations he singled out in this thread have in common? Oh, they are majority South Asian.

He says: 'If we swapped out Bradford's Muslim population for an Israeli Jewish one, the city would very quickly become one of the most prosperous in Europe, rather than the Islamofascist extremist dump it has become.'

Because Bradford was super prosperous before the Muslims got there? He cannot even differentiate between Jews and Israelis which somehow the idiots supporting Galloway even managed to do, since Bradford does have a Jewish population they didn't want to target.

&gt; i haven't seen him post any trp shit on this sub but if i did i'd downvote it.

Why? At the end of the day it's just his opinion, it'll hardly be facts based just like the racist bile he's spouting which gets upvoted.

true,loveandmonsters,lfc99,,"Cool story. It reminded me that the manager of the Portland Thorns (women's team) is Paul Riley, who I had no idea is from Liverpool until I heard him in a post-game interview. PTFC are hugely popular here (19,000+ at the last home game!!) and I'd always wondered if he followed footy from back home (he's been in the US since early 80s, playing and coaching). I did a search online and came up with this snippet from an interview from early this year:

*I imagine it’s hard not to get involved with soccer growing up as a boy in Liverpool. What was the experience like for you?*

PR: My entire family is Red, you don’t get a choice. When I was 12 years old, I went to Liverpool and Everton. Everyone said Everton had a better youth policy; you’re better off going to Everton. Liverpool at the time was probably the best team in Europe. My grandfather looked at me and said, “You don’t have a choice to go Red or Blue,” and I said, “Yep, you’re right.” That was the end of that.

I was at Liverpool for a couple years and I came here to the U.S. because I felt there was better opportunity here in the long run than there was at Liverpool. My best friend, Gary Ablett, who was going to come with me, got signed by Liverpool and I didn’t get signed so that’s when I came here and stayed here. I’m Red through and through. My basement is covered in Liverpool memorabilia, my man cave. I know everything about Liverpool managers and players. My dog is called Shankly after probably the greatest Liverpool coach of all time—Bill Shankly—that took Liverpool from the Second Division to the First Division in 1962. I’ve got about 35 pictures of him in the basement. He was our hero and he’s the guy that built the club.

The only thing that was blue in my house when I was a kid was the toilet paper. Everything else was red. We had season tickets. I’ve been going to games probably since I was 5-years-old. I go back once a year, always get tickets for a game, sometimes twice. I went to the Manchester United game in September and I’m going to the Swansea game in February. This year it’ll be two (trips) hopefully. I went to Champions League in Paris and watched them beat Real Madrid. I’m a massive Liverpool fan and a staunch anti-Manchester United fan as most Liverpool fans are.

*It’s a good thing the Thorns wear red then, right?*
PR: The first thing my wife said was, “You know they play in red, right?” and I said, “Oh my god, thank God for that.” My club in New York was navy and white when I got there and now they play in red. All the top Premier teams play in red. I’ve just got to speak to Gavin about playing “You’ll Never Walk Alone” before the games; I’m not sure how he’d go for that one. Maybe I could persuade Merritt to do it. I don’t know, that could be a tough one.

------------------------------------------------

Been meaning to go to a Thorns game in my time here ... I'll go in my LFC jersey for sure if I do!

The thing no one mentions is the cluster fuck behind the scenes, Fergie still hanging around like a bad smell, Glazers doing god knows what with the finances since old malky shuffled off, one minute it's '250 million warchest this' and the next lvg is saying, 'we might not need to sign any players' and who could forget sir ryan as the assistant he didn't want. The man who was reportedly the first to get out the knives for moyes behind the scenes because he wants the job, you can bet your life he's going to do the same on lvg if he thinks he can get the job. lvg is not the type to react well to behind the scenes interference, it's like a ticking time bomb ready to go off. And then you've got a clown as chief exec. 

It's interesting you mention wages because if anything that's a disadvantage, 300k a week for Rooney, 100k for Shaw any player joining them now is going to want parity, I don't care how much they have they can't pay their entire squad that sort of cash and if they do it's going to have a huge effect on money available for transfers. 

Who knows though maybe they pull a ton of cash from somewhere and splurge 150 mil+ on new players because that's the only way I see them getting top 4, look at that squad. 79 points for cl last year, no way on this earth they get 79 points as it stands.

true,The_Shithawk,null,null,"Great post - interesting reading. Thanks!

I can't agree about Ba though - for me he was always a poacher with excellent abilities inside the six yard box, but lacking the full range of qualities of a great all-round centre forward. A great 2nd/3rd striker, but not the man to lead the line of a world-class club. I appreciate everything he's done for Chelsea and wish him well at Besiktas, but I never felt like he was the man to take control of Chelsea's ambitions in front of goal. I think Costa is absolutely that man, and the threat of having him in front of goal will have the added advantage of pulling defenders away from Hazard. I wouldn't be surprised to see Hazard scoring 15+ goals in the league this season.

I think, as you do, that Chelsea should be favourites to win the title this season (I didn't last year for what it's worth). I think it'll be a tough race though, and I can see Man City pushing us to the very end. Either way, I think City and Chelsea are the two squads that have the quality in depth to compete all the way through the season, and will finish #1 and 2. I think Man Utd and Arsenal will be the teams competing for 3rd. In future seasons I see Man Utd being right up there, but I think they'll need at least one season to get fully up to speed.",0,1407443663,null,0,false,0,cjjunwg,t3_2cwyy6,t1_cjjunwg,t3_2cwyy6,null,1435124861,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Sion however had signed several players outwith a FIFA ban and played them in both legs for extended periods.

I don't think the length or effectiveness of the player on the pitch is truly what matters in terms of punishment. It's how the integrity of the game would possibly be effected if other clubs did the same thing.

Sion intentionally broke an embargo to make large investments. Legia failed to follow the correct administration procedures. Had Sion got a soft punishment, it would likely render current/future embargo's useless thus disarming FIFA from regulating the game effectively. If Legia get a soft punishment, nothing will really change.

Legia will get a small fine at the very most, unless it effects FIFA's capability to regulate the game which I doubt.",0,1407443767,null,0,1407444430,0,cjjuq3v,t3_2cwmfx,t1_cjjuq3v,t3_2cwmfx,null,1435124909,1,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1

1. Chelsea
2. Arsenal
3. City
4. Liverpool
5. United
6. Spurs
7. Everton 

Reasoning: 

Chelsea have a squad that can dominate most midfields, and a very scary strike force that is absolutely suited to Mourinho's tactics. Diego Costa will not be a flop IMO, and is exactly what they need. 

Arsenal played very good football last year, finished 7 points off the top. They will comfortably beat all the teams they need to beat (ie bottom 10). They absolutely need a DM, and that was shown in the rompings they suffered by Us and Chelsea last year. 

My problem with City is that Aguero is going to be injured, and Jovetic seems to be pulling a diaby. Negredo and Dzeko are both quality but I'm not sold that they can carry them to a title winning squad. Yaya will regress massively IMO. I think we'll see a City team that is a lot better defensively, but worse offensively.

We're in the same boat as City, except they're better. I think they'll be a 8-11 point gap between the top 3, and then Us/United. We're going to score a lot less, and they're will be quite a few games where we're not going to find a creative spark. This season should solely be focused on champions league qualification, because our squad is not built for win now. 

United will struggle from October - January. 3-5-2 is absolutely not meant played in the premier league IMO. Its much too tactical a position, that requires a slow tempo. I don't believe that will ever happen in the premier league. Their 3 CBs also aren't world class, but each are mobile so they'll end up having a decent, but not good enough offense. Also, 3-5-2 is going to limit them offensively against the poor teams. United don't have the attackers to play counter-attacking football after taking the pressure that a 3-5-2 invites. 

Spurs will improve, their squad is too good not to. Everton will be very close to them. I see these two being neck and neck, and ~ 7 points behind us. ",0,1407444943,null,0,false,0,cjjvev2,t3_2cw8l6,t1_cjjvev2,t3_2cw8l6,null,1435125317,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I don't think the length or effectiveness of the player on the pitch is truly what matters in terms of punishment. It's how the integrity of the game would possibly be effected if other clubs did the same thing.

Sion intentionally broke an embargo to make large investments. Legia failed to follow the correct administration procedures. Had Sion got a soft punishment, it would likely render current/future embargo's useless thus disarming FIFA from regulating the game effectively. If Legia get a soft punishment, nothing will really change.

Legia will get a small fine at the very most, unless it effects FIFA's capability to regulate the game which I doubt.

You really can't change the scope of a punishment vastly due to how much of an effect or how much time he was on the pitch. You could use that as a bit of evidence of the clubs intentions.

Got there at around ten to 8, nervous as fuck. Queued up, handed over my license and got signed in. Was asked a basic question on the difference between a stop and give way junction and my mind went blank, not a great start.

Went through all the basic stuff (importance of tax, mot insurance and why).
Rattled through the basic exercises of bike control.

Felt as if I excelled during the highway code knowledge section, being an avid cyclist and just generally having an interest in vehicles and motorcycles helped.

Road ride; mostly spent trying to shake off cycling habits. Such as;
- Carrying momentum, a bike can accelerate easily
- Lines/Roundabout/Cornering speeds.

I was pretty nervous, but gradually built confidence (but not over-confidence) and the rest of the ride went well.

Finished at around half two, walked down to the local motorcycle dealership to pick up some engine oil and an alarmed disc lock.

Sorted out insurance, then head out on my first solo (geared) ride.

Thoroughly enjoyable. 

First time I'd take the bike above the middle end of third, so it took a bit of getting used to. After riding round a few quiet lanes, I would get upto 30 maybe in sixth, and then gradually lose power. Realised as I was on a 50cc 2 smoke, I needed to rev a lot higher to keep the power up. Headed into my local down, filled her up with fuel then headed out along the major a road I live next to.

Possibly the best birthday to date.

I think people are a little harsh on Moyes. He did well with Everton. I agree that he's not the best manager in the world, but I don't think he's bad, I think he just doesn't have the balls to call big decisions, which is what was needed to follow ferguson. I think it might also put LVG in a stronger position following Moyes than Ferguson.

The running of the club is certainly concering (for united fans) for sure. I'm not overly familiar with the finances of a lot of clubs. Are United in that bad shape? I know they certainly aren't struggling for income. I think they definitely need to sign some players to compete for sure. Of course there's Vidal talks (Would be very surprised if it happened), and also Di Maria (Would also surprise me as LVG doesn't look like he wants to use wingers). That squad isn't really a top-4 competitive squad.

I'm also not overly familiar with LVG's history. I know he seems like an absolute cock, but has he been known to go off on one if behind the scenes is a bit dodgy? Because that seems so likely to happen at united.

Hmm, that's an interesting way of looking at wages. I sort of meant from the point of view that no player is going to be put off going there by having to take a wage cut.

Your hypothetical is one i'd take instantly! One Suarez and one dud? Yes please! I think Cavani would be a roaring success. He scored heavily for Napoli in a slower paced more defensive league than the Prem. Then he bagged 25 for PSG playing only 1/4 of his games as the CF, rest of the time on the wing. He would feast in the Prem.

Here's a stat for you. In the 12 games he played as the main striker for PSG last year he scored 11 goals. He still averaged a goal every other game when played as a wing and provided some assists. It's his consistency that I like and that's throughout his career. He's also never had any serious injury concerns.

Isco? He's a definite talent but we don't really need another attacking mid/playmaker. We need a goalscorer.",0,1407447301,null,0,false,0,cjjwpog,t3_2cx0kx,t1_cjjwpog,t1_cjjw0mv,null,1435126010,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

* NBC: one of the broadcast channels that is free to watch without a subscription. You should just be able to turn on your TV and find it without much hassle. Same goes for CBS, Fox, ABC.
* NBCSN (NBC Sports Network): requires a cable subscription to watch
* NBC Sports Live Extra: also requires a cable subscription, this is where you'll be able to watch every single Premier League game. For example, NBCSN might be channel 200, the Live Extra might be channels 201-206 and on each channel would be a different game.
* nbcsports.com: allows you to stream each game on your computer, would require you to have a cable TV subscription in order to watch.

According to [this site](http://www.livesoccertv.com/teams/england/liverpool/) the Southampton game will be on NBCSN, but as it gets closer to the 17th you might double check just to confirm.

I think sane heads would prevail and we would win the referendum and stay in, but there is always that worry of what would happen if UKIP manage to persuade enough people to vote in favour of leaving?

&gt; Luckily in FIFA, there is a way around it as long as you stop trying to play our opponent as if they're a person who wants to play soccer. Also try hoarding possession completely or ceding a ton of possession and playing only on the counter. Both of those work as well for obvious reasons. I find those kids who only like to long ball also love trying stupid skill moves. Force them wide, then give them an extra step of space, they'll use that to make a dumb spin move and you can pick the ball and counter.

You see my friends aren't that predictable. They've got both those moves in their arsenal, so I have to put in 150% of my concentration into making sure I don't make even 1 small mistake, or else I will most likely concede. Now I would have been fine with that if it was a realistic situation from which I concede. But for example, if my opponent just can't find a way through and he's playing with Madrid (90% of the people pick Madrid), then he's going to use Ronaldo to shoot from 40 yards, and my goal keeper will either miss it completely because its Ronaldo, or he will parry it straight to Benzema or another Madrid player.

It seems to me that they're a party who started with the conclusion that the EU is bad, then worked backwards to find evidence for it. They don't seem to have any principles on matters, just say whatever is convenient at the time and will make the EU look bad. 

They complain the EU removes sovereignty, then support Israel, who attack Palestinian sovereignty, and ignore Putin's attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty in order to blame the Ukraine crisis on the EU. 

They protest that the EU is undemocratic, while supporting less democratic institutions like the House of Lords. 

They criticise the spending of the EU, all while taking as many benefits as possible from the institution, giving none to charity of costing the taxpayers money on an institution UKIP have no interest in cooperating with.

They present themselves as a working persons party, in antithesis to the 'political elite', while their leader went straight from a posh private school into his fathers business and city trading, and wouldn't look out of place as a Tory MP. 

They use statistics to suggest that the country is full of non-English speaking children, preventing the natives from learning, whereas this statistic would also include the children of the leader of the party. 

They complain that any media criticism is a smear campaign, all while they welcomed bigots like Roger Helmer and Geoffrey Bloom into the party. 

They're a party of hypocrites, who don't base their arguments on evidence, rather on an assumption that the EU is bad. They only came into mainstream popularity because of a perfect storm on the main three parties being as unpopular as ever, and media support for their anti-immigration and anti-EU stance. When pressed on issues outside the EU in the general elections, a lot of this popular support will crumble.

What I meant was if you're not a team cemented in the champions league you can't simply spend your team and resources developing youth. Dortmund and Atletico have the luxury because there leagues and not as competitive they can spend a season or two with promising youngsters and it doesn't mean too much it's a long game to catch up with Munich, Madrid, Barca. Can we do the same? Fuck no, we'll be overtaking by by one of 3 very good teams waiting to sneak into the top 4. A top team buys for the now first and foremost while having the later in mind too but in this league you can't fall behind.

Could we spend our team developing youth and one day it takes us to the top? Yes but it would involve probably 2/3 years at least of us lying in 6th/7th/8th and some good fortune that a bigger team doesn't take our most promising players. 

Just in case I rambled to much I'll sum up. Our league is far too competitive to be able to just buy promising players and hope they develop we'll be overtaken and left behind that's a luxury in Spain, Germany and maybe Italy to a certain degree.

Similarly, it confirmed UKIPs view that the majority support leaving the EU, and that they have to support to become a mainstream party in the general elections by focussing on the EU alone. 

They all ignored that many voted for UKIP not just because of their views on the EU, but because they were tired of the main three parties, and the similarities between them. ",0,1407449601,null,0,false,0,cjjxxmw,t3_2cwv9j,t1_cjjxxmw,t1_cjjwp1b,null,1435126628,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,voliton,null,null,"I think the key part of that is ""hearing rumours"". I know Barrett said we inquired about Falcao and Cavani's agent said there was interest... but that doesn't mean we are actively pursuing either. I think the idea was always to buy a back-up striker - Remy was supposed to be that person but for whatever reason that deal couldn't be completed. Sturridge is going to be the main man this season (and in the future) whatever happens. Personally, I think that we heard Falcao might be available, thought we'd have a pop, then heard the price and promptly turned around and walked away.

With the Remy deal collapsing obviously we've had to struggle to find a suitable replacement. Bony is the obvious choice and if Swansea agree to drop his release clause (although I'm told by a Swansea-supporting friend that it's all rubbish) then I'm sure a deal could be done. Beyond that, we're in a bit of conundrum. Sturridge needs a back-up because his fitness is not great. We need someone between him and Lambert in terms of quality. That means someone who will be happy to sit on the bench, but will be able to come on and score if we need to. Personally I think that rules out most, if not all, players from Europe. They need time to adjust to the league that I'm not sure we can afford - and we risk a Soldado situation.

Therefore, I think we have to turn to the Premier League, and again Bony stands out. Someone in another thread mentioned Jovetic who would be decent if City were willing to sell, but I'm not sure who else would fill out needs.

All went quiet for a while, then they installed the ramp barriers allowing only registered taxis through. The barriers took so long to operate that it might take a taxi driver 6 minutes to get to Waverley Bridge. On many  occasions the ramps failed and they had to be lowered manually. 

The council huffed and puffed about court action but since they have no control over Network Rail property it came to nothing. Network Rail then decided that they didn't want even authorized taxis in the station and they closed it totally.

At the bottom the industry is absolutely bursting with people trying to get in. The mistake is that it's focusing on people with academic success rather than the guys like you who are self taught.

[This](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/broadcast-schedules.html) is the webpage you are looking for.  Tells you exactly what the official TV schedule is in the US.

Should you not have access to the required channels and you don't fancy going to a bar then try [www.wiziwig.tv](http://www.wiziwig.tv/).  You'll want AdBlock if you don't already have it.

If you have SkyGo in the UK or BT Sport then you'll want to look up something called ExpatShield.  That'll set your IP address to one in the UK.  There are others but that's the one I used.

You should definitely check out 11th Street bar which is the home of the NY Supporter's club.  If you're in Brooklyn then the Roebling's Inn on Atlantic is  the place to be.

Places to avoid are Nevada Smiths and Legends.  People say they're the place to be for football but they're full of Mancs in the former and Chel$ki in the latter.

If you have any other questions then don't hesitate to ask.  Don't stop at football either, you must have other questions about being an Englishman in NY.

1. River was able to create objects inside the ""mental link"" even though she should not have been able to do so.  So she wasn't simply in Madame Vastra's mind.

2. River's grave was seen on Trenzalore, even though she did not supposedly die there.

3. River was supposedly only be able to be seen and heard by Clara... if so, then speaking the Doctor's name wouldn't have opened the tomb.

4. Since the Doctor could see and interact with River the whole time, or at least once she appeared before the tomb, and even after Clara was dead (at that particular point in time) then she wasn't simply in Clara's mind.

5. The Doctor says River is an echo which ""should have faded by now"".

The implication is that River's essence inside the computer has somehow managed to survive and transcend its limitations, perhaps even allowed River to live on permanently in some form.  She has some ability to physically project a hologram-type thing of herself in space and time, and may even be linked to the Doctor's body or TARDIS in some way to be able to do so.

Of course, how we don't know yet.  Personally I can see River downloaded into the TARDIS core and becoming one with the TARDIS itself, which would make sense.

true,DGS83,null,null,"I’m currently in the final stages Of an OU degree; I also have experience of studying at a brick Uni back in the late 90’s. I have found the OU to have been a very rewarding experience; I chose to take an Open BSc Hons, 120 credits at levels 1, 2 and 3. Having already gained a diploma in higher education from the brick Uni I could use this for a credit transfer for all of my level one credits and half of my level 2 credits. I have completed two 60 point modules and am currently taking a 30 point level 3 module in structural engineering. I have found that the quality of tutors has been outstanding, as well as the level of support. When I have struggled with the life study mix I have been granted extensions. The text is very prescriptive, but then I am taking technical subjects. The open route has allowed me to tailor my degree so everything I take is relevant to the masters I am hoping to start in September 2015. 

There are some downsides to distance learning, there is limited interaction with other students, and each module I have taken has only had two or three face to face tutorials, most being on-line. Each module has got its own forum what many aspects can be disused, most modules also soon get an unofficial Facebook group as well. The main drawback is the amount of time it takes out of your life, since starting the degree keeping on top of my garden and DIY around the house has been limited, after the first year of OU I realised that I would have to scale back things such as my hobbies and being social, when an assignment is due I lock myself away in the study and only come out to eat and drink or sleep. 

I doubt I would have had the self-control when I was younger to compleat a distance learning course. Now I am in my 30’s I find that I do have the discipline needed. 

As for any snobbishness it’s not something I have come across, I have spoken to academics and employers who mostly say that they hold graduates of the OU in high regard when choosing applicants for employment or post grad studies. I the view of those who I have spoken to is that they feel that if someone is prepared to take up to six years of dedication in their own time sacrificing so much free time to achieve their goal.

Next year when I stand in the cathedral wearing my gown whilst my family who have been extremely supportive watch me receiving my certificate it will be one of the proudest days of my life.

true,L2Kenny,lfc99,,"Ok, Liverpool's team lineup will probably change a lot because of the players we've signed this transfer window, but our typical lineup should be:

4-3-3 (4 defenders, 3 midfielders, 3 strikers)

***GOALKEEPER***
Goalkeeper: **Simon Mignolet** (Sea-mon Mig-no-lay). He was our first choice Goalkeeper last year and that's not going to change now

***DEFENCE***

Right Back: This is likely to change as will the rest of the defence but for now it will be **Glen Johnson**. A player who is known for his defending and attacking prowess but in recent years has performed far below the acceptable standard.

Centre Backs: **Dejan Lovren** and **Martin Skrtel**. Lovren recently joined the team whereas Skrtel is a veteran who's been around since 2008.

Left Back: **Jose Enrique**, like Johnson he's known for his attacking as well as defending. Unlike Johnson, he's still a good player and a fan favourite because of his instagram and Twitter posts.

***MIDFIELD***
Centre Defensive Midfielder: **Steven Gerrard**. Home grown lad, fan favourite and a decent player. If you're a Liverpool fan, you love Captain Fantastic. Captains Liverpool and captained England until he retired from England. Past his prime now but was once the one of the greatest midfielder in the world.

Right Centre Midfielder: **Adam Lallana**. A new signing from ~~Liverpool B~~ Southampton. Made Premier League Team of the Year (along with Gerrard) and is known for being a goal scorer, leader and an allround good player

Left Centre Mid: **Jordan Henderson**. They say 70% of the world is covered in water, the rest by Jordan Henderson. A good player who convinced manager Brendan Rodgers that he deserved to play for Liverpool after a terrible(YMMV) start to his Liverpool career. 

Left Winger: **Philippe Coutinho**. A tricky Brazilian who many feel should have made the Brazilian National Team. Known for his pace and skill, he's an exciting player to watch

Right Winger: **Raheem Sterling**. A fantastic young player and possibly the biggest talent we have. 19 and already a first team player and undoubtably one of Liverpool's best players.

Striker: **Daniel Sturridge**. A fantastic striker who scored the 2nd most goals in the entire Premier League last season (behind Luis Suarez, a Liverpool player who left for FC Barcelona (a Spanish club) for £75m in July). A rare talent and one of the best strikers in the entire league

Manager: **Brendan Rodgers**, a *young* manager (he's only 42) who took Liverpool over in 2012 and led them to 2nd place last season and a return to UEFA Champions League football

true,pineapplecharm,cnty-england,London,"I think the point is that people who tailgate rarely do it because they've forgotten not to tailgate.  They're not skillful drivers, they're already pissed off, they're being aggressive and the only way to get rid of them is either (a) to speed off faster than they can - and I do mean ""can"" since they will often continue to tailgate you up through 100 just to show off how much you were in their way - or (b) to let them by.  Flashing brake lights, slowing down, waving, giving the finger etc tends simply to enrage them more and cause further risktaking behaviour like undertaking (although if they have room to do this, you're in the wrong) and so on.

Having said all that, I do remember being closely followed by a woman while I was on a driving lesson.  Being inexperienced I felt the pressure to keep my speed up and entered a roundabout faster than I should have.  Leaning over to change down into 3rd I missed and went into 1st.  When I let the clutch up the car almost stopped, and of course with no brake lights.  I was as you can imagine quite flustered by this but managed to limp through the roundabout and out the other side and when I finally remembered to look in the mirror again she was about 100 yards behind me and staying there.  So I guess that technique works.

In other news, I also did the IAM course.. in South Africa.  That shit was so nutty it's not recognised in Europe.  It had mandatory paranoia like counting your wheel nuts before setting off, and always having the doors locked.  My favourite was always leaving a car length ahead when in queueing traffic in case you had to book it out of there to avoid getting carjacked.

The EU is playing stupid games with Russia. Enacting trade embargoes on Russia. Russia is now seeking to do the same to the EU. Before all of this kicked off the EU had a lot to lose from decreasing trade with the UK. It is simple. Our economy is strong. It is growing.

Black represents that they had a Team of the Week (TOTW) performance (they were the best in their position out of all the teams that played that week). Their stats go up by +1

The Blue means they were officially in the Team of the Season (TOTS) which gives them a massive stat increase and general significes they were the best in the league.

&gt;Panama, which has used the US Dollar for one hundred years, is the most useful example because it is a relatively rich and stable country. A recent IMF report said that : `By not having a central bank, Panama lacks both a traditional lender of last resort and a mechanism to mitigate systemic liquidity shortages. The authorities emphasized that these features had contributed to the strength and resilience of the system, which relies on banks holding high levels of liquidity beyond the prudential requirement of 30 percent of short-term deposits.’
