Adults will still be totally 100% free to choose their own religion.  But until the age of 18, the state should regard children as being of undetermined religion and view it as a violation of their rights if they are forced to attend church or take religious instruction.

But St Ives is not close to Cambridge. If you want a social life, I'd try and get something in closer or get a share house. It's about a 45 minute walk from St John's to Cambridge central. Cambridge is a fairly small place, so anywhere in between the centre of the city and your work isn't a bad commute.

I know lots of people who live in the Chesterton and Arbury areas. They're not the prettiest suburbs but they are convenient and well serviced by buses.

Do not try to commute via the A14. It is hell on earth. 

With regards to buying, everyone I've met says it's a good investment as Cambridge is choked by traffic and anywhere in close to the parks is only going to increase in value. Also, they are currently extending the rail line and the bus line near the business/science parks. 

Forget about buying in Histon (unless you're lucky). It's a well sought after suburb by families because the schools are highly regarded. People will pay above and beyond to get a foothold in that catchment area. 

There's talk that places like Waterbeach will be up-and-coming soon if they put in a train station at the Cambridge Business Park.

South Cambridge is extortionately expensive because it's a commuter suburb for London. Think ¬£500K+ for a 3br townhouse. Nice townhouses though.

If you go North from St John's you have the A10. This is a bit of a shit road, but there are OK villages along it. The road is only 2 lanes so you can imagine what the rush hour traffic is like. I'm sure they will have to widen this eventually, so places like Ely will go up in value. Ely is very pretty, has a few train lines, and has a nice feel to it.

Clegg promised one too, and yet from what I've seen of the EU TV debates, he has no interest in it anymore. It's been 40 years since the British public got a referendum on Europe - And back then we were voting for a *common market*. Things have changed alot since then, and we got little say in how things evolved.

I'm voting UKIP because I want a choice in the matter. I also think that while some of their policies, particularly in regard to climate change, are backwards, the large majority of them are what our U.K. needs right now. Maybe not in 10 years, but certainly now. The three parties have been far too comfortable for far too long. UKIP's rise has been a long time coming.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"MEPs can do far more than merely approve legislation. In fact the net neutrality law was going to significantly limit neutrality according to the commission's proposal until the MEPs amended the legislation to give it stronger definitions to prohibit more stuff than it would have. They have 3 readings which they send back and forth between them and the council (which is made up of elected politicians from member states) and they can amend the law at each stage. If they can't agree the law is scrapped and sent back to the commission. The ideas are only proposed by the Commission and the skeleton text is too but the actual articles can be amended. 

Also worth mentioning that the Commissioners are selected from a short list chosen by the elected governments of the member states. There is one commissioner per member state: our commissioner is Catherine Ashton the High Representative on Foreign Affairs and she was selected to be sent to Brussels by Gordon Brown (who was head of an elected government...in theory).

QI explains here:

- The truth: It is proven that Alan really does have a small penis.

- Parliamentary privilege: An MP could say Alan has a very small penis because no legal action could be taken.

- Tangent: There is also increased privilege in peer-reviewed scientific journals. So Brian could publish a paper about Alan having a very small penis and Brian would be relatively immune, unless Brian was being malicious about it. In America this is referred to ""Absence of malice"".

- Good faith: You really did think that Alan had a really small penis and the statement was not meant to be defamatory.

- Opinion: It is your opinion that Alan has a very small penis, in comparison to someone else's.

- Public interest: The public has the right to know that Alan has a very small penis.

- Consent: Alan agreed with you and had told you that he had a very small penis.

- Vulgar abuse: Just being rude about Alan having a very small penis rather than defamatory. Similarly calling Alan a motherf***er is vulgar abuse, but claiming that Alan actually had incestuously sexual relations with his mother would be defamatory.

In fact I think the vast majority of pro-EU people in the general population would be opposed to large scale political integration. I would count myself in that group. I think David Cameron, while he missed the point with regard to most of his demands from the EU, is right that there should be a wall in the treaty to prevent any form of federalism unless agreed to, probably unanimously. Federalism is not what we signed on for and the aspirational language of treaties and speeches of the past should not be considered as capable of binding the EU to the course that the most imaginative early pioneers of European co-operation imagined. We should be allowed to be cautious. 

None of that is incompatible with thinking that free, open and common markets in goods, services, workers and capital is a fabulous thing, nor with thinking the EU should have a role is universalising workers rights, discrimination protection and other pressing social issues where there is a really genuine consensus among the members; for the EU to pass a law banning race discrimination, which it has done, is both necessary (as it gives a new avenue of legal recourse for victims of discrimination) and equally uncontroversially accepted as a principle of the modern, liberal democracies that we at least claim to operate. Federalism is irrelevant and not necessary to achieving these things. A fiscal union may be needed in the EZone but again that does not actually necessitate federalism even if it does point there. If there was such a roadblock in the treaties to prevent the EU becoming a federal state while remaining enthusiastic about the freedom we get from universalised rules it would shut down 40-60% of the silly colloquial arguments against the EU - EUSSR/United States of Europe etc etc. ",0,1396646361,null,0,false,0,cgk8nei,t3_226p1c,t1_cgk8nei,t1_cgk4ggq,null,1433212535,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It means MS will not release any updates or enhancements to the public, and no more security updates - which is the really big issue for organisations like the government. It's rumoured that the sorts of people who like doing nasty things have a lot of exploits up their sleeves, waiting for end of support so that MS is unlikely to fix them (or at least not release a public fix, although given the scale there would be pressure for them to do it). As XP seems to be maintaining and even gaining market share despite being dead, it'll be disastrous if something gets out.

By negotiating a contract like this, even if the public won't get updates, MS will still be obligated to sort things out for the UK government. Everyone else is left wondering why the UK government couldn't have moved off of XP in the 7 or so years they had to prepare for it. I understand in countries like the US there are also legal concerns if you're handling personal/confidential data on a unsupported operating system, I don't know about the UK.

A majority of the public support the decriminalization of weed and even if they don't feel the same way about other drugs atm the trajectory of public opinion is towards more liberalisation. Combine this with countries like America and others actually starting to legalise certain drugs, that sentiment is only going to accelerate when they see it can work. 

I get the feeling Farage considers drug liberalisation a pretty important issue and if he ever got any power would actually make a move on it (especially with public sentiment going in his favour) in contrast to the current crop of politicians who if anything are going in the opposite direction with the smoking bans, consideration of minimum alcohol prices and recent EU laws going after E-cigarettes. 

The direction of the current establishment is more nanny state policies whilst Farage is advocating for the opposite, more personal freedoms.

&gt;if the ISPs can't squeeze more from the content producers to cover **what they claim are** the costs of improving service, then they'll just fuck the customers even harder.

I think that probably the majority of what ISPs do is to drive bigger profits; I never intended my point to be anything other than that. I don't think in any way that any of that is good for consumers/content providers; only in the sense that eventually the only edge they can get over each other might be by improving quality of service, but that's probably a ways off.

&gt;Content providers would definitely just pass the costs on to customers. Consumers will end up paying for the double dipping for no appreciable increase in service.

Yeah, but they won't have to pay ISP costs as much any more under the NN rules and, like I said, I doubt they will reduce their prices.

Seriously.

true,cannotdecideaname,null,null,"I work valuing final salary pension schemes so I can answer this a bit.

Putting a value of final salary pensions is really hard. This is why pretty much all the schemes closed, because they are too expensive and way too risky for companies. They are risky for the government too, but they have enough money to keep the schemes open. Any Transfer Value you get does not really reflect the true cost, what ever number they might tell you that's is not the REAL cost, it is a projected cost.

Very roughly, if she works in the NHS for 30 years, earns ¬£40,000 a year  (when she is 65) and retires at 65, the pension value right now will be over something like ¬£500,000.


1/60th of final pensionable salary for year paying 5% contributions, is an unbelievably fantastic deal. Pensions for NHS/Army/government workers are a HUGE benefit to the workers, a massive, MASSIVE perk. More valuable than your 20% DC pension scheme.

Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) it depends what you buy for the money. It can be like a having an extra DC pension fund, it can 'buy' extra years of service when doing your pension calculations, there are too many variations to be able to tell you for sure. If you can find out more I can help out out.

At the age of 30 and being in a 1/60th final pensionable salary scheme, there is no reason to need another pension pot (or SIPP) right now.

If the NHS goes belly up the government guarantees her pension, unless the whole country goes bankrupt you'll be fine. Basically don't worry about it.

If she stops working for the NHS it MIGHT be worth transferring the funds out the a DC scheme, but it will depend on the financial conditions at the time, and how long she has left to retirement. But not transferring it out will also be fine: once she left it will grow with inflation each year but capped at 2.5% per year, which isn't great, BUT the value can never go down (like your DC fund can) so it's still safe.

Any more questions let me know.",0,1396648601,null,0,false,0,cgk9nrx,t3_227q7n,t1_cgk9nrx,t3_227q7n,null,1433213003,13,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,13

true,thenumpty,null,null,"&gt; What is the current value of a future final pension? I can ask for a Transfer Quote, but that takes months apparently.

As a final salary pension is a defined benefit you have to make a lot of assumptions about future investment returns, inflation, mortality and other demographic features in order to place a value on it. The transfer quote *should* be based on best estimate assumptions, and so could be used as a realistic value of the pension. However, to purchase an annuity that offers the same annual pension more than likely costs more than what you would receive from a transfer.

&gt; Is 5% a large contribution for a final salary scheme? Comparable to my own 20% defined contribution in terms of retirement potential?

The cost to provide the benefits will be much higher than 5%. I would expect the NHS to be paying around 15% on top of this as an employer contribution. [NHS scheme is unfunded so not sure how this works but a private sector scheme would typically cost between 15% and 30% depending on the benefits and they would pay the difference of the total cost and member contribution] I would say the benefits provided by the NHS scheme are probably worth more than a 20% contribution into a DC scheme, but it depends on a lot of factors.

&gt; What's the point of additional contributions? All they say in the guide is ""extra contributions will lead to a higher pension"". How much more for every ¬£ typically?

I don't know how it works in the NHS but some scheme's provide added years for additional contributions. i.e she pays 5% extra and receives an extra 3 months pensionable service a year. I'm sure if you ring the administrators of the Scheme they would be more than happy to explain how it works.

&gt; Is it worth getting her a separate SIPP to diversify? Should I be worried NHS pensions will go belly up at some point or dramatically lose value?

NHS pensions are backed by the government, so really are very secure. Also, any accrued benefits should be guaranteed - they can (and are, I believe) reduce the value of future benefits but they still seem very strong compared to the private sector. [One exception I know of is the switch to CPI, but I think this was more of a loophole] Depending on how the additional contributions work then investing in a SIPP could be beneficial, even if they are to just be taken as a tax free lump sum on retirement. [At retirement final salary pension can be commuted for cash at retirement - I don't know about in the NHS but local government schemes have very bad terms for this]

&gt; She might not always work for the NHS. Can one transfer out into a SIPP and are there disadvantages? Can one keep the pension in the NHS and would it somehow grow over time?

You can transfer out at the moment, but the government is aiming to stop this for public sector schemes following the changes to DC pensions announced in the budget. I would say it is probably best leaving it in the NHS scheme unless you don't believe the NHS benefits are for your wife and you. It should increase at the rate of CPI inflation if she leaves the NHS and loses the final salary linkage.

I work on private sector pension schemes so don't know much about the NHS pension scheme or other local government scheme, but if you have any more questions I'd be more than happy to help (or at least try!)

PS for tax purposes HMRC multiply the annual pension by 16 to value it. You could use this as a rudimentary measure to value your wife's pension when she receives her annual statement.

true,theyeatthepoo,null,null,"&gt;Thanks for sharing this example of doublethink.

It's not double think. His race was relevant, just not relevant to his election victory. It played a part in the process as it always does. The Media talks about race and the candidates address it. But it was not a factor in him getting elected.

&gt;You seem to ignore the fact that others think very differently to you. The clip I cited was well known because it went viral but there are over 20 million Google hits for ""I voted for Obama because he's black"". You might not think the same way, you might not like the fact that this is a thing, but it really doesn't change the fact that significant numbers of voters did the exact same thing as the woman in the video. Determining how many and the effect they had on the overall result is a fruitless endeavor but to pretend that they don't exist and didn't have any effect on the election results goes beyond naive and into the realms of conspiracy-theory-level-nuts.

Do you think that the video went viral because she was expressing a typical humdrum opinion or because her opinon seemed absurd to the majority of people? Of course the answer is the latter because the vast majority of people do not vote for somebody based on their race when, as they see it, their vote will effect their imiedate future (its the economy stupid). 

How have you come to the conclusion that a significant number of voters did the same thing as the women in that video? More importantly how have you determined that those numbers won him the democratic nomination? This video is not even with regards to the democratic nomination.

You've still failed to back up your extradordinary claim. All you have done is given your opinon of him as a candidate and linked to a youtube clip of a women who votes based on race. I never said nobody in the world votes based on race. If I had that video would have been relevant, as it is it just made your argument look weak.

&gt;Determining how many and the effect they had on the overall result is a fruitless endeavor 

Then how did you come to the conclusion that Obama won he democratic nomination because he was black?

&gt;Really? You fail to understand the argument I put forward and yet I'm the idiot? Hell, you fail to even understand your own argument when you say:

    ""I do not think that his race was a factor in him getting elected. I said his race was relevant.""

I will try to explain it clearly for you. I do not think that his race was a factor in him getting elected but of course race was relevant to the process of election in so much that people understood that he was mixed race and that the other candidates where white. People talked about race and the media talked about race. That does not imply that Obama's race won him the election or even had a positive (or negative) effect on the votes he got. Try to keep up.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; He had a higher strike rate when Suarez was out. 

Marginally, but from a small sample of games from the start of the season that also included playing 120 minutes against Notts County. That's a pretty tenuous set of data to try and make the claim that Sturridge would get as many or more goals without Suarez in the side. Especially when a good chunk of Sturridge goals this season have come from Suarez assists. If Suarez is hassling defenders, having people double up just to try and stop him, and generally making the opposition defence shit themselves, then that can only be a massive positive for Sturridge. When Torres was playing for us he was basically our only source of goals besides Gerrard and the one decent season Kuyt had, and despite the fact the defence could focus almost all their attention on him, he'd still manage to find chances for himself and put them away.  

And I'd say in his better seasons Torres was [easily as prolific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pobbwioAIO8) as Sturridge has been - I'd rate him somewhere between Suarez and Sturridge at the moment for his ability to hold off defences, magically create chances from nothing, and finish pretty much any one-on-one. Torres scored slightly fewer goals per game, sure, but he was playing in a defensive Benitez side that was focused far more around 1-0 and 2-0 wins than the kind of 6-3 goalfests we get under BR. It's a really unfair comparison to say Torres didn't score as often so isn't as good a striker. By the time Chelski bought him he wasn't a ¬£50m striker, but in his prime he easily was, and I don't think Sturridge is quite at that level yet. 

And back in his day Owen was a seriously prolific striker too, again in a Houllier side that was set up pretty defensively. I doubt he'd have won a Ballon D'Or if he'd been against the likes of Messi for it, but he was a seriously good striker around the turn of the millennium, and he was in a pretty shaky squad at the time too.

Opiates don't really cause any long term physical harm apart from the imbalance of brain chemicals they cause which will rebalance themselves after a few months.

Rather than opiates being illegal I think more should be done to help people that use it to self medicate in the first place. 

Better treatment of pain sufferers without just labelling them drug seekers then stopping or reducing their medication and spotting mental issues and dealing with them earlier would be far more effective. 

Of course some people just do it because it fun but the best course of action for them is a clean safe supply and high quality treatment available if or when they decide to quit. 

Modern drugs like suboxone enable people to feel pretty much normal while they are dealing with their addiction.

I couldn't choose what I wanted for my first tattoo. Did I want something semi-serious, classical, or literary? Or did I want something frivolous, fun, and nerdy? So I decided to combine the two.

Memento Mori doesn't actually mean ""remember you are mortal"". It literally means ""remember to die"", but in the legend behind it (the Roman Triumphal Procession) it means ""remember you will die"".

More importantly, Memento Mori is the name for a physical or symbolic reminder of the inevitability of death (photographs of dead people, skulls, paintings of the anthropomorphic personification of death, drawings of extermination-obsessed Daleks, etc).

So I decided to use a Dalek as a symbolic reminder of inevitable death, because it's fun and thematically appropriate. Also, because once I settled on a ""latin phrase tattoo"" I couldn't use ""exterminate"" any more. In English, exterminate means to get rid of something and implies you are killing it off.

Including last season that's 11 goals in the 10 games Suarez was out, that's a decent sample size to at least get an idea that Sturridge's strike rate wouldn't drop by much if at all when played as the lone striker.   
  
Don't get me wrong, Torres was an amazing player, he holds the record for the fastest player to get 50 league goals for Liverpool but Sturridge is on course to smash that record. At his peak, he was certainly a more graceful and glamorous player than Sturridge but in terms of output Danny so far has been better than Torres at his best.  
  
I think Sturridge still gets massively underrated because of his baggage from previous clubs and the fact that as good as he's been he's still only the second best striker at the club.

It must be awful to have your position/pay etc. eroded with no real way to fight back, but to be in the kind of job where taking drastic action to defend yourself gets you particularly strongly attacked because of peoples vague idea that universities ought to be somehow more friendly than a 'normal' business (although of course they aren't behind the scenes, which is what caused the problem in the first place).

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; piss on the teachers who think that punishing students for the university's behaviour is in any way acceptable.

they aren't punishing students. It's the university that's attacking students by attacking lecturers, whose interests are ultimately aligned. Having teachers that are over-worked, stressed, and barely receiving enough to live isn't good for the education of students. Of course the university wants you to swallow the idea that it's students vs. teachers, but it isn't...its students and teachers vs. university management (who've seen their pay rise by at least 5% in relation to university staff who've had it cut by 13%. It's worth remembering those who've been on strike isn't just lecturers, but lots of workers who don't even earn the living wage (IT, Library staff, research assistants etc.), i.e. enough to live, those represented by Unite and Unison ‚Äì in fact the next task is to organise those workers outsourced by the CEOs of universities, such as security and cleaning staff).

Of course you could think about it the other way. Students are paying 3 times more yet there's not enough money to pay staff, that's what students should be complaining about..**at least** if prices rise (in the process of mutating education into a commodity) students could expect that their fees would go to staff and teaching, to those who run the university and provide the education, but it evidently doesn't, that's what you should be complaining about also.

Teachers on strike isn't equal to other strikes because, the 'customer', the students are also workers...they form a theoretical middle-ground between the two (since though we buy education, we accept the rule of the university with its rules and regulations relatively equal to workers) - we aren't just consumers, we are involved in the regulation and production of knowledge itself; we know our teachers, we interact with them every day, and if you hadn't noticed most teachers are distraught over the reality of the strike...no workers want to strike (after all they lose a days pay), workers are forced to strike to protect their interests and themselves. 

But university staff more than most have been divided over the strike because they realise that education is important, they love their job and love teaching and thus don't wish to inflict even the smallest of harm...but the fact is things are going seriously wrong with education, we either put our food down united as students and teachers or we watch it go by, sacrificing the life of teachers and workers in the process. No harm is done in the attempt to save education from the process of commodification, of it being completely de-valued, from the complete demolition of critical thinking and alternative opinions in genesis since the 1990s. The university is a factory, we can shut it down, but ultimately we can take it over, run democratically by students and workers, under the control of those affected and those that know, the university can be something different.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"wow are you people really that thick? knee jerk reaction if I ever saw one. 

You're statement is that democracy invalidates another form of opposition that isn't itself through the democratic process (i.e. that if you oppose the conservatives vote differently).

The fact is most rational people would agree that **even though** the Nazi's were democratically elected they should be opposed with degrees of force. If you agree with that then you weren't stating this as a matter of principle, but rather that it depends upon the content of that democratically elected party (i.e. the Nazi's were bad etc. therefore degrees of vandalism et al. would be justified) and what they do. I implied as such when I said that, though of course the conservatives are no way equal to the Nazi's, because of what the conservatives do, I'm not against acts of petty vandalism (though I may disagree to there efficacy) - (I wouldn't justify the same form of response to the Nazi's as the conservatives because they are radically different, I would support strong degrees of force to oppose the Nazi's which I wouldn‚Äôt towards the conservatives).

I seem to have forgotten the mentality of this subreddit, what I assumed what relatively simply rationality has forced an elucidation of several paragraphs. But it's always easy to destroy those who fetish form over content. If you support democracy in principle, as an absolute, then should support the Nazi Party, if however you regulate your support for democracy with other ideals (such as freedom, individuality, rights, morality etc.) then in extreme cases those ideals require a rejection of democracy (not in this case though).

I'm gonna make a rather pointless statement, but just because democracy is somewhat subverted by illegal lobbying (bribes), which is still a huge matter of debate, that doesn't actually mean the democratic system is 'completely' bust. It means that in the UK it is operating in a sub optimal format, but A) still works, but with inefficiencies and B) doesn't prove our system is necessary flawed as can still be put right or amended. 

I'm not saying illegal lobbying (As opposed to legal lobbying which I whole heartedly support) isn't a problem and doesn't influence politicians' stances on many subjects, however, I think to claim that just because a system works sub-optimally does not mean we should call the system broke or useless or whatever else. It's the best system of governance humanity has so far developed, by virtue of being better than all the other shitty systems rather than by virtue of it being a good system.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"That's a fair point. I think there's also a slight chicken and egg thing with Sturridge - it's difficult to really say whether he's scoring a lot of goals because he's in a team that's scoring a ridiculous amount, or if a very large part of Liverpool's ridiculous goal tally this season is because of Sturridge. A lot of people would probably wrongly say it's the first one and not appreciate his contribution properly.

I think for me the main reason I'd still hold Torres in high regard would be because he'd just create the chance and convert them himself. Sturridge is very clinical at putting away chances that are presented to him, but it's usually in a position where you'd expect a striker to score. I'd say his goal from range against Everton and the one when he returned injury against Stoke are probably the only two ""I didn't think he'd score when he got the ball"" moments that stand out for me, maybe also that one he had early in the season from range too (I think also against Stoke?). Torres on the other hand just seemed to be able to get the ball somewhere near the box, take it through three defenders and slot it home. 

And I don't mean to discredit Sturridge and the fact that him finding himself through on goal with fairly straightforward chances on a regular basis is still plenty down to his own pace, positioning and awareness (he is absolutely superb at knowing when he's offside in comparison to any other striker we've had recently). He's a *very* good striker, and I don't feel the fact he's scored 20 league goals this season is some sort of fluke. I just feel that he's not quite as complete a player and is a bit more reliant on the team and tactical setup around him in comparison to Suarez or Torres in his prime, who could seemingly just magic up a goal even if everyone else was having an off day. Sturridge has done that on occasion, but he doesn't seem quite as reliable for it. 

And either way after a few golden seasons Torres completely went off his game and he's a shadow of his former self these days. If Sturridge can keep up something close to his current form for two or three more seasons then he'll probably eclipse Torres completely.

""mullet man"" was played by an actor called paul hawkyard. His profile is here. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370303/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t5.

heres what he looks like in real life (http://imgur.com/l6dzuDN).

according to imdb he currently is in a series called old jack's boat on cbeebies. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/old-jacks-boat) and the into on youtube for you (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG6kyj1mtZE).
So don't worry he's not on the dole.

For those of you out there that didn't see it (90 percent of people reading this) the program was basically a poor rip off of trailer park boys (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988/?ref_=nv_sr_1) except based around the american mullet hillbilly metal fans. The violence and stunts in the program were ripped off from jackass (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264263/?ref_=nv_sr_6) that was also popular at the time.

This question brings me back to being 13/14 flicking through channel 500 and something late at night trying to find something to watch and making the mistake of watching this a few times.

Believe it or not you some people are wanting to bring him back (http://www.petitiononline.com/mull666/petition.html), these are an example of the quality were talking about .(http://youtu.be/ESCipvfVKno)+(http://youtu.be/ESCipvfVKno).

you can find the series on youtube.

There seems something so quintessentially English (British? UK'ish?) about putting up an emotionless front while going about getting the job done. But clearly there's a newer way of thinking that shows that understanding your own mind and working through emotions and thoughts cannot hurt, and could maybe even help in getting an athlete ready for a big challenge.

Find it incredibly strong leadership and maturity for Gerrard to share how its been working for him. Clearly if a 'manly man' like him can sit down and talk to Dr. Peters, other players can too?

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"Exactly what /u/XXLpeanuts said below - a lot of the people who whinge about how bad BR was 'back in the day' tend to refer to the 1990s, at which point Thatcher had long since already started the privatisation ball rolling, and Major cut funding drastically in 1994 knowing that BR would cease to exist by the end of the decade. As a result, BR had over a decade of underfunding with carriages worn out, services cut and timetables merely functioning as suggestions. For people to point their finger at BR from about 1988 to 1999 and exclaim, ""Look at that! Remember that? That's why privatisation is better!"" is to completely miss the larger point that not only are train fares on average about %30 more expensive than they were 20 years ago (adjusted for inflation), but railway companies now receive government subsidies worth several times as much as the operating budget of BR before the beginning of privatisation.

[Fullfact](https://fullfact.org/factchecks/taxpayer_subsidy_train_network_nationalisation-3391) provides a fantastic article about this. Here are some key points:

&gt; This picture shows that, in the last few years of British Rail‚Äôs existence, the proportion of government subsidy to passenger revenue was between 40 and 50 per cent. But post-privatisation, it fluctuated greatly between 26.2 per cent in 2000-01 to 55.7 per cent in 2006-07.

&gt; Christian Wolmar is definitely right to point out that the level of taxpayer subsidy to the rail network currently stands at several times the real terms equivalent before privatisation. **Indeed the figures show that in some years, Network Rail has received more money from taxpayers than from passengers post-privatisation.**

&gt; However the current level of Government investment in the railways may owe much to the ongoing fallout from privatisation, in particular the collapse of Railtrack in 2002, which in turn may mean that subsidies could fall back in the future.

Absolutely. Stiff upper-lip and the like. There's even that line by Pink Floyd in ""Time"" (i think that's the one): ""Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way."" A lot of that attitude holds true to this day, I feel.

There is a nostalgia bias when comparing old to new, but its natural and everybody does it.

The other Torres downside is his first season was the only season at Liverpool where he played more than 30 league games. In the other 3 seasons he barely cracked 20 games played, and his scoring rate was 0.4, while Sturridge is nearly 0.8 and *with a full season* (which is important).

Because, much like the Y2K issue IT departments have known about it for years.  Most if not all IT departments have had reports on the validity of any number of technological solutions to this issue up to an including going back to the original vendor for a rewrite/upgrade.   Assuming the original vendor is still in business or the same line of business of course. 

Universally it's a pity the IT departments don't get final say in such things, the accountants do and all they've seen for the last ohhh... 15 - 20 years is IT wanting to fritter away money of fixing something that blatantly works just fine. 

People are exceptionally quick to blame IT for these things, however IT is usually quite powerless to do jack shit about it until it is far to late, far more problematic and far more expensive. 

In fact, paying 5.5m for a years worth of extended XP support year on year until the cows come home is probably cheaper than replacing all the WOW16, JAVA &lt; v 1.6, ActiveX and similar ancient cruft.

Help To Buy is assisting many in scrambling onto the property ladder, and we'll probably see a steady period until the election is over, then interest rates will go up and anybody who gambled their life savings on buying their first house may well live to regret it...but that depends on the level of rate rises.

The Mortgage Services review is just about to happen which will make access to lending a little tougher, so it may cool things slightly - right now the market is steadily rising. 30% more houses on the market than this time last year, still not enough supply to meet demand. Interesting dynamic.

Lecturers are always very reluctant to engage in a marking boycott. Nonetheless the Universities are being particularly intransigent at the moment and, after four or five years of other actions, have left the lecturers with little choice other than to do this or give up any hope of restoring at least part of their lost pay. 

In the final analysis a strike action that doesn't inconvenience the 'customers' will not succeed - this is why it is easy for tube drivers who can inconvenience people quickly and difficult for lecturers where there are much fewer pinch points (teaching boycotts just lead to the loss of a day's pay and the need to catch up the taught material on another day anyway).

This expertise could be drawn from the body of teachers and parents in some cases, but to do so would often create conflicts of interest which would make a quorum impossible for many decisions.  Each governing body has its own constitution, which must include certain classifications of people such as parents and teachers (legislation determines the minimum numbers or % of each) but the rest are determined by election by other board members.   A good board will have a strong chair, representation from different sub communities (parents and teachers, etc), along with professional expertise not directly connected to the school (lawyer, accountant, local business-people, local authority people, etc, etc.  It's up to existing members - in conjunction with OFSTED and other consulting bodies such as NLE, to determine what is needed on the board.

Basically what the banks are doing is because its there, they're willing to lend a higher amount to lower qualified applicants, meaning mortgage approvals are going through the roof.

The reason they do this is that they know there is government money floating around so these 'subprime' applicants have less chance of being unable to sell in the future if they can no longer afford repayments - the government will give someone a deposit to buy their house as a FTB.

The quick summary: mortgage lenders are increasing the risk they accept, because they know the government has a lot of money ready to bail them / buyers out if it goes bad.

I have spoken to a mortgage broker recently and he has said - in 2014 the concept of a multiplier is gone. It doesn't matter what your salary is in relation to the amount of principal you want to borrow - they simply look at the affordability of repayments now.

In the scenario you give, the active member getting a CETV one week earlier would be a lower PENSION than the same member becoming an preserved member and getting a CETV a week later, as you would have 1 week of inflation increases applied. If the member stayed active over the week, they would have one week of extra service and the pension would be higher.

I highlighted PENSION because the VALUE of that benefit could change noticeably in a week, as it's based on projected inflation and interest rates: if there has been something significant happen in the markets within that period of a week (although actually within one week it probably would be the same as they look at the end of the month previous for projections, lets say over 2 months) the difference affects the CETV.",0,1396691516,null,0,false,0,cgkmbtz,t3_227q7n,t1_cgkmbtz,t1_cgkkv12,null,1433219109,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

&gt;__Paul Stewart Robinson__ is a [fictional character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts\)) from the Australian soap opera *[Neighbours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbours)*, a long-running serial drama about [social life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation) in the fictional Melbourne suburb of [Erinsborough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinsborough). He is played by [Stefan Dennis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Dennis). Paul debuted in the serial's first episode in 1985 and appeared on a regular basis until 1992 when Dennis quit the serial to pursue other projects. Dennis briefly reprised the role in 1993. Dennis returned to *Neighbours* full-time in January 2005. He later said it had been a mistake to leave the series. Paul was created by producer [Reg Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Watson) as one of *Neighbours*' original characters. He made his debut in the soap's first episode on 18 March 1985 and is the only original actor still featured in current episodes.

Midfield: If we lost Barry then Darren Fletcher is a similar player, who's had an unfortunate few years but is top class.

&gt;Being a deputy PM does not make you a God, it doesn't matter how much of a cult of personality you have. I'm sorry to break it to you.

I never suggested Farage would be able to implement it and he hasn't even promised anything. I do however believe that he is sincere about his desire to change the law if he could which I doubt applies to many politicians. 

I'd rather vote for a party that I thought had honest intentions but only a small chance of implementing their ideas than perpetuate the status quo by voting for people I already know are liars. 

As I said in another comment, the idea of drug decriminalization is gaining ground and that will only accelerate with America actually implementing it so Farage may have a chance if he ever got any power.

We'll look a more attractive option than the likes of United/Spurs because even though they have plenty of cash, they don't have the most amazing footballing incentives.  But when the playing perks are similar (Champion's League, fighting for the title, etc) players are going to follow the money almost every time.  We'll be able to separate ourselves from that awkward grey area where we were just barely not quite attractive enough to bring in those big targets we chased last summer, but we'll find ourselves in a new one where it's a financial war for players and compared to the likes of City/Chelsea/Arsenal we have less to spend.  It'll be really interesting to see how things go this summer.  I think we'll get the players we want for the most part, but don't be surprised to see a fair few potential targets snatched out from under us again.  This time it'll be more about money though, not a lack of trophy chances and lack of UCL football.

Those should be paid for by the license fee, but the fee has soared since the advent of digital channels, and I don't agree with funding multiple channels of repeated shite that aren't adding anything worthwhile to the public sphere. They should not be using a legally enforced license fee to compete with commercial channels, they should be using it to do something commercial channels can't or won't, for the public good. That's the only way to justify a mandatory fee/tax/whatever you want to call it.

I'm not saying they shouldn't try to make popular programmes too - they make comedies and dramas that commercial channels won't take a risk on, for instance. But cooking/singing/dancing game shows etc. are not in the public interest and are not something that commercial channels shy away from.

&gt;We'll forget that the fundamentally libertarian concept of freedom of movement (often uncontrolled freedom!) isn't completely opposed by UKIP.

You cannot live in a more libertarian country under the yolk of the undemocratic EU and unlimited immigration is a fundamental aspect of it. If you don't have state sovereignty everyone just gets dictated to by the EU. Look at the US, if it didn't have the system of partial state autonomy they wouldn't be gradually legalising marijuana because the federal government apposes it. 

&gt;For fuck's sake, 70% of their supporters back re-nationalising rail &amp; energy!

That isn't anti-libertarian. Libertarianism is about the public having the freedom to be governed as they wish. If the public mutually consents to nationalisation of certain services that's perfectly acceptable. 

&gt;*[We'll] fight proposals like unwanted housing developments, unwanted out-of-town supermarkets and inappropriate energy schemes*
Sound very libertarian? Free market, anyone?

Yes it does. Libertarians would decentralise power so local communities have more ability to govern themselves. If they want to preserve their area and prevent new building it's their choice, they shouldn't have anything forced on them.

true,apr400,null,null,"The demonstrators are probably PhD students being paid fairly poorly and have relatively little experience of teaching (they do it to learn teaching as much as to get paid - when I did it (which was admittedly years ago) I was only paid for contact time, not preparation or marking, so I would do about 2 - 2.5 hrs work for each hour of pay). 

I teach in Engineering, where the direct teaching cost per student is about 12.5k. That employs the demonstrators, pays for the teaching space, lab equipment etc, the administrative support and for part of your lecturers (more on where  the rest of the money comes from below), and have been in both industry and academia. I like choosing my own research area and that is why I put up with the lower pay and worse conditions. I also enjoy teaching, although I loathe marking with a vengeance (the average student has absolutely no idea how time consuming and tedious marking is!)

The average pay for University lecturers is indeed somewhat higher than the average pay for teachers, but then the jobs aren't really comparable. For a direct comparison you would need to compare a Teaching Fellow at a Uni to a teacher at school and you will see that then you are far better off being a teacher if money is your motivator. A lecturer has significantly more on their plate than someone who is teaching only. For instance let's just compare teaching: at undergrad level in addition to teaching entirely disparate subject areas (which few teachers do - I teach in three different subject areas - two of which I had to teach myself first - I am not unusual, the days of lecturers only teaching their own area of expertise are long gone), deciding the syllabus (which teachers no longer do), setting the exams (which no teachers do (except as a second paid job)), marking the exams (which no teachers do (except as a second paid job)), we also teach at masters and at postgrad level - all very different types of teaching. These days we also have to have an additional qualification on top of a PhD - the PCAP, like a PGCE for teachers only for HE - I did mine on 'day release' over the course of three years (not that there is any reduction of load to do it!). It is not uncommon to have to take on new courses as people leave or change roles and then you need to redo the course yourself (you can always tell a lecturer teaching someone else's material!) That can take several hours for each hour of contact. Of course even when your course load is stable you need to keep your material up to date but that is much less onerous - typically an hour per hour of material delivered. 

Beyond that we typically have a slew of teaching administration jobs (which teachers often do do, but for additional money in the teachers case), we take tutorials which is fairly unique to Unis (I do about 3 - 4 hours of tutoring a week) and which requires you to be able to answer fairly technical questions well out of your own personal area of expertise, as well as parochial care (which we have to have yet more training for), and we have to provide a large portion of the course materials, particularly in more advanced areas where the is no text book. In addition to teaching on courses you will also have to manage some, which means coordinating other lecturers (talking about herding cats) and making sure students are registered, attending etc. There are also things like being a year chair (making sure all the courses in the school for a particular cohort are going okay, managing cross-school course, overall syllabus control and quality assurance, managing scheduling clashes, student issues beyond what a tutor can handle, examination boards, etc) or the like. Most academics will have at least one role of that nature. 

We are also supposed to be undertaking pedagogical research and enhancement. It is not enough to be a good teacher - you have to find and implement new ways to be a better teacher and monitor that. I am currently half way through redoing a course to try and improve learning outcomes, based on some research from the US on alternative teaching methods. It has meant learning a lot of new skills. I will have to monitor progression of students on the old and the new course styles throughout their degrees to see if this is effective. 

Then we have our 'academic community' role which requires us to take on things like peer reviewing of journal papers (I do 3 or 4 a month), conference organisation (1 major, 1 minor a year for me), journal editorship (2 for me), outreach work with schools (lectures, popsci articles, tours of the dept, visiting schools, helping with Sci/Eng competitions  etc, etc) (one or two of the previous, plus several dept tours a year for me), serving on Research Grant panels, reviewing grant applications, any number of other committees (both internal to the Uni and private or public sector at National and International level). There are any number of other academic community roles - you never really know what you will need to be doing from year to year but it certainly keeps you busy (I'd note that all of this is part of your role - no bonuses for taking this stuff on). We are also supposed to do knowledge transfer, and in my area this is a big role. This means going out to companies to help with problems, advising on product or process improvements, running experiments for companies (that are within your area but not necessarily your interest) and so on. 

That lot supposedly takes up about 60% of our time. The remaining 40% is for research which is the reason that most of us do this. As I said above I would much rather be able to research what I find interesting than what a specific company finds interesting. I get to range more widely. Don't take that to mean that I am looking at stuff that is not commercially useful though. I am (mostly) working in an applied area so collaborate with about 15 companies at the moment including three or four very closely. With my research hat on I manage a team of about 10 people (PhD's and postdocs) in the UK and also have five people in companies, two of whom I manage directly and three of whom I guide technically. I manage a research budget of between 200k and 500k per year (depending on how successful my grant writing has been recently!). 

Research involves all sorts of things but starts with thinking up ideas, which means staying current with the literature. I seem to recall the average academic reads about 600 journal papers a year plus skims a lot more abstracts. That sounds about right. Then comes building collaborations (in my area at least most research collaborative either across the Uni, or institutions, or borders these days) and then writing grants to get money either from research councils, charities or companies. The hit rate for proposals is about 10% on average although I do a little better than that and some people do a lot better. Writing a grant proposal can take anywhere from a couple of days for a small one to three to six months of solid work a leader for a large multinational multi-institution grant (I have not done one of those yet although I was institutional lead on one which was hairy enough). A typical grant proposal is probably two weeks of solid work spread out over a couple of months. 

Once you have your money, the University immediately takes about 1/2 of the top for 'overheads'. Then it take an additional amount to cover your salary. I am supposed to try and cover forty percent of my gross salary cost in research grants and can put up to about 10% of my time on a proposal at most (typically more like 5 - 7.5% as this is the easiest place to keep grant cost down). Then you have to run the project, supervise your research teams, manage a functional lab and provide equipment and consumable, come up with experiment designs and ideas, analyse results, make sure everything is double and triple checked, write reports, edit papers and presentations, find money to send people to conferences, go to conferences, and on and on and on. You also have absolute responsibility for safety - which can be a challenge in most academic labs which are crammed full of poisonous chemicals, high voltage equipment, bio-hazards, radioactive sources, and really just about every interesting way of killing someone. And of course do this on multiple projects. I run two major and 3 minor projects at the moment each of which needs to be thought about and managed separately. 

The problem of course is that whilst I am still getting to choose my own research I am having less and less time to do it, or rather in my case my hours have now expanded about as far as they can, and it is getting more and more difficult to cram everything in. There is an every greater load of red tape to deal with, and teaching demands continually seem to increase (our dept has increase in size about 30% with a 5% increase in staff - better than most, but not sustainable). The only way to keep up is to work increasingly insane hours and unlike teachers we don't get a great big holiday in the middle of the year to recover. So I catch up on the emails that came in overnight for at least an hour before I got to work, work a full day, and then catch up on reading, writing and emails for three to four hours in the evening after the kids are asleep. It would be unusual not to have to work at least one weekend day too. I am nothing special amongst my peers in this respect.

None of this is to denigrate teachers in anyway, but just to indicate that the jobs are significantly different - a lecturer has to chop and change between far more job descriptions on a day to day basis. Teaching can be a difficult and challenging job, but a couple of my friends are secondary schools teachers, and despite being good teachers neither of them work anything like the hours we do (and they earn more!). Doubtless there are teachers who have it worse than some lecturers and doubtless some lecturers who are not particularly committed (although in these days of continuous performance assessment they are a dying breed) but most of us work pretty bloody hard. Anyway best get off - can't procrastinate doing that marking anymore.  

TL;DR: Teaching is hard work in one or two areas of focus; lecturers need to be able to take on far more roles.

Bayern is a possibility with Robben/Ribery ageign.

Dont really see him at Barca when they already have Neymar and Messi

Dont see him going anywhere else in England as thatll make him public enemy n1.

I cannot understand CH's thinking in not playing two recognised wingers/wide midfielders.

Again, Snodgrass has forgotten how to kick the ball it seems and we are absolutely NO threat from corners or FKs any more. This often lead West Brom being able to counter with pace and this is what cost the solitary goal today. Snod gets tackled in midfield too easily, gets up the field for the Baggies, Olsson slips unfortunately and Amalfitano scores in a similar vane to how Hooper scored against West Brom in the reverse fixture.

We were always on the back foot from there and Norwich just cannot score in this situation. Opposition team parks the bus, we lack creativity/width/skill to break down the defence, no matter how shit the defence is. It is very frustrating.

Would have taken a draw with today's dire performance, Fulham winning hasn't helped the situation. We need to play like it's in our own hands. We usually don't play well against Fulham and our away form suggests that we have little chance of picking up 3 points at Craven Cottage.

West Ham play anti-football which can be broken down by our immense pace.

City are vulnerable in midfield and on the counter, we should've beaten them at the Etihad, and this time it's at anfield.

Norwich would lose even if only Suarez gets played. He'd still outscore them.

Chelsea play defensive football but our attack is faster than their defence. If we hit them on the counter I can see us winning quite easily.

Palace will be well and truly safe by then. They'll have nothing to play for. I don't see why we won't win that.

true,Roods,England,Hertfordshire - '07 GSXR 600,"To the best of my knowledge in France you are required to have the following when travelling on a motorcycle:

* Passport (goes without saying really)
* Spare headlight bulbs
* Motorcycle documents (V5, insurance, etc)
* GB sticker on numberplate

As far as I know hi-viz vests aren't a requirement but its been a couple of years since I've been on the continent on my bike so the rules may have changed. I've also heard that the requirement to have breathalyser kits has been dropped as of last year. 

Practically, you can get away with having none of the above with you and personally I've never bothered with having a GB sticker on my numberplate. It's a rare occurrence to get pulled over for no reason. However if the authorities have a reason to pull you over (say they catch you speeding) and discover you don't have the kit listed they will probably add that to the list of offences they charge you with. My opinion is that its best to have the equipment listed, not because of any legal requirements but because not having them can be a pain in the arse if you run into any problems.

Stuff to watch out for in France:

* watch your speed the last 30km on the way to Calais (the A26 if my memory serves). The French are big fans of setting up speed traps to snare Brits who are racing back to Calais to catch the ferry/Eurotunnel back home.
* motorways have a variable speed limit depending on weather conditions (130km/h in the dry, 110km/h in the rain)
*  Priorit√© a Droite - priority to the right, so always expect some lunatic to pull out infront from your right when crossing junctions 

In Germany speeding through towns is a big no-no; if you get caught the police will throw the book at you and you'll be facing a hefty fine. However outside of populated areas policing is a bit more pragmatic when it comes to enforcing the speed limit. Now I'm not saying you can go 100mph+ through the black forest without being pulled over but I've been past police going faster than the posted speed limit and they didn't seem to bat an eyelid.

1. Living in the city is fine. I live just north of the city centre and have no problems whatsoever. Be aware that rent around the city is *very* high. If money is a concern, the rent in the surrounding villages is quite a bit cheaper. People in Cambridge are generally nice in my experience, and it's a relatively quiet place as well.

2. I'd say that, yes, Cambridge is safe. There's obviously crime, but that's true of any city. I certainly feel safe walking around the city at most times of day. After having lived in much less nice places, Cambridge certainly feels safe to me.

3. Cambridge is quite a diverse city. Partially because of the University, partially because of tourism, and partially because it's less than an hour from London on the train. There's lots of different nationalities in the city.

4. I'll leave this question to someone else, as I couldn't say as an English person.

5. A couple of events that I can think of off the top of my head are:
   * The Summer and Winter beer festivals, which are great fun if you like proper beer.
   * The [Science Festival](http://www.cam.ac.uk/science-festival), which has just finished.
   * The half-marathon, which has again just finshed.
   * Lots more that I can't think of right now...

6. For me Cambridge can, at times, be a bit *too* quiet, fortunately London is about 50 minutes away on the train so you can go down to London for the day (or night) if you're looking for a more metropolitan night out. It's also *very* expensive to live here. I pay ¬£1000 a month to live in a semi-detached house with my girlfriend, and I'm not really close to the city centre.

&gt;

&gt;___U-571___ is a 2000 film directed by [Jonathan Mostow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Mostow), and starring [Matthew McConaughey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey), [Bill Paxton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton), [Harvey Keitel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel), [Thomas Kretschmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kretschmann), [Jon Bon Jovi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bon_Jovi), [Jack Noseworthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Noseworthy), [Will Estes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Estes), and [Tom Guiry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Guiry). In the film, a [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) [submarine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine) is boarded in 1942 by disguised [United States Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy) submariners seeking to capture her [Enigma cipher machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).

&gt;The film was financially successful and generally well-received by critics in the USA  and won an [Academy Award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award) for sound editing.  The fictitious plot attracted substantial criticism since, in reality, it was [British](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) personnel from [HMS¬†*Bulldog*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bulldog_(H91\)) who first captured a naval Enigma machine (from [*U-110*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-110_(1940\)) in the [North Atlantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic) in May 1941), months before the United States entered the war. The anger over the inaccuracies even reached the British Parliament, where Prime Minister [Tony Blair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair) stated that the film was an ""affront"" to British sailors. 

&gt;The real [*U-571*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-571) was never involved in any such events, was not captured, and was in fact sunk in January 1944, off [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland), by a [Short Sunderland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Sunderland) [flying boat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_boat) from [No. 461 Squadron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._461_Squadron_RAAF), [Royal Australian Air Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force).

&gt;*U-571* was filmed in the [Mediterranean Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea), near [Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome) and [Malta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta).

Mainly because next year you are automatically going to have Chelsea, City, Arsenal, Liverpool, United, possibly everton and hopefully us competing for four spots. 7 teams, 4 spots.  Our track record isn't great, so  I'd rather have another option into the champions league, because it is going to be hard as hell to get that fourth place spot.

I hate to say it, but this was our year to get into fourth and we fuckin' blew it.  Hard.   With United stepping on their dick, it opened up a spot for us to slide into... unfortunately liverpool stepped up their game and swooped in and are now challenging for the title.

true,glitchybitchy,null,null,"If I hear this one more time I'm going to slap a bitch. Honestly. Has anyone here actually ever been to Brazil DURING a World Cup? ANY World Cup? I'm guessing the answer is no. Because if you had you would know that during the World Cup all everyone does is watch football. If it's a Brazil match the streets will literally be empty.
Bottom line is, yes, there are violent crimes in Brazil every day, you also have to put this into context and remember that Brazil has a population of 201,032,714, the fifth most populated country in the world and also the fifth largest country in the world. It also has some of the largest metropolitan areas in the world.


This doesn't mean that the crime is proportional to the UK by any means, it's undeniably higher but it's also not the crime ridden hell that international media seems to think it is. It also should be highlighted that a lot of violent crimes in Brazil are related to drug trafficking and alcohol consumption. This is very true for tourists that think that they can just waltz into a dangerous area and score some drugs, people tend to forget that their little recreational drug habit has a consequence, and this is true for all countries. What I mean by that is that a lot of drugs circulating the US and Europe originate in South and Central America, just because their drug habits don't seem to have a direc relation to violence in their immediate surroundings does not exempt them from the fact that it has very real and serious consequences in other places.


Finally it's worth pointing out that the Brazilian government has a tendency to ""wipe out"" crime by relocating poor/ crime ridden populations away from critical areas during international events that are featured in international media. This happened when the Pope visited Rio and the government sent in the army to deal with a particularly criminal area. It's a vile practice, yes but it shows that the government will not risk being embarrassed on international media, which adds to my whole point. FUCK ALL is going to happen during he World Cup.

 [**Shor's algorithm**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s%20algorithm): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Shor's algorithm__, named after mathematician [Peter Shor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shor), is a [quantum algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm) (an [algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that runs on a [quantum computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer)) for [integer factorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization) formulated in 1994. Informally it solves the following problem: Given an integer *N*, find its [prime factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor).

&gt;On a quantum computer, to factor an integer *N*, Shor's algorithm runs in [polynomial time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_time) (the time taken is polynomial in log *N*, which is the size of the input).  Specifically it takes time O((log *N*)^3), demonstrating that the integer factorization problem can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer and is thus in the [complexity class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class) __[BQP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP)__. This is substantially faster than the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm, the [general number field sieve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve), which works in [sub-exponential time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-exponential_time) ‚Äî about O(e^1.9 (log N)^1/3 (log log N)^2/3).  The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the [quantum Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform), and [modular exponentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation) by [repeated squarings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring).

&gt;If a quantum computer with a sufficient number of [qubits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubits) could operate without succumbing to [noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise) and other quantum decoherence phenomena, Shor's algorithm could be used to break [public-key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) schemes such as the widely used [RSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm\)) scheme. RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large numbers is computationally infeasible. So far as is known, this assumption is valid for classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring is efficient on an ideal quantum computer, so it may be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large quantum computer. It was also a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers and for the study of new quantum computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called [post-quantum cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography).

In both the City and Chelsea match threads it's like easy karma to complain about how many Liverpool supporters there are in the thread or just generally talk shit about us.  Which is odd for the Chelsea match, especially, because there are about 10 of us with 'pool flair commenting.  And yet if you rank posts by 'Top' then the first and fifth highest are both about how awful/obnoxious we are instead of the match itself.

&gt;The __*Astute* class__ is the latest class of [nuclear-powered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion) [fleet submarines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSN_(hull_classification_symbol\)) in service with the British [Royal Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy). The class sets a new standard for the Royal Navy in terms of weapons load, communication facilities and stealth. The boats are being constructed by [BAE Systems Submarine Solutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Submarine_Solutions) at [Barrow-in-Furness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow-in-Furness).  Seven boats will be constructed. The first of class, [*Astute*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Astute_(S119\)), was launched in 2007 and commissioned in 2010, and the second, *[Ambush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ambush_(S120\))*, was launched on 6 January 2011,  and commissioned on 1 March 2013.  Both vessels are undergoing sea trials.

Short answer: No.

Slightly less short answer: No. I took them to court. They settled out of court for the amount I was claiming. 

Interestingly, they (Vodafone) have deleted the thread on their forums - given that others from around the same time are still there, this is a bit odd. So. There was a problem with one of the BTS (masts) in the area that I worked. Signal was provided, but there was an issue whereby there was nothing beyond that. Calling my handset (and any others, such as those of my cow-orkers on VF) would result in the call going straight to answerphone. Outbound calls just gave network busy. This started in September. Gave it a couple of weeks, no change. Contacted them - no problems they could see, despite it happening to everyone in my office/the building next door. They agreed to send someone out. Equipment is located in a BT building, so access had to be arranged. I asked for a refund of my bill for that month - my line rental/package is ¬£50/mo - so not a small amount. Denied. Mid October, I say ""Look, this is silly now - I'm losing money. I'm an IT contractor, people can't get hold of me"". No dice. ""Fine"", I say. Write a LBA to them. This gets the exec office on the phone, who offer ¬£100 as a goodwill gesture. Better than nothing, but I still needed another 200 quid to buy my contract out. They refuse. I start court proceedings. Issue was resolved in December. I had a settlement from them within the last month for the full amount I was claiming. *shrug*",0,1396724119,null,0,1396724564,0,cgkv5zm,t3_229pof,t1_cgkv5zm,t3_229pof,null,1433223339,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Here's my go:

After independence, homosexuality has often been seen as ""un-African"" or as an import of the West, with the homophobia perpetuated by colonialists merging into modern African culture. This is despite the fact that pre-colonization, there is no record of African laws prohibiting homosexuality, and there is [evidence that homosexuality was routine and ""socially sanctioned"" in Lesotho and Northern Congo, for example.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality#Africa) 
Colonialists imposing homophobic laws and teaching that homosexuality was wrong, as well as the Christian ideal of the nuclear family, contributed to embedding homophobia in the culture. A large number of African countries were decolonized while homosexuality was still illegal in the UK, and many countries kept a lot of the laws Britain had established, which included the ban on homosexuality. 

I'm not trying to absolve the countries that are still strongly homophobic, or imply that they had no choice in carrying on the laws at all, because that's certainly not true, but the generation living in Africa at the time of colonization would have grown up with homosexuality being portrayed as immoral and illegal, and that certainly has had a big effect. The practice in Congo I referred to earlier for example, [ had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to a researcher by the elders to whom he spoke, ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality#Africa) so by the time the Congolese area had been decolonized (1960 onwards), very few people living there would have known about or seen homosexuality having been accepted. 

Religious fundamentalism has also seen a huge surge in popularity, and with this comes further homophobia. The US missionaries hunoverseal referenced are very unpopular in the west noawadays, but do well in parts of Africa. Leaders like Robert Mugabe have used LGBT people as scapegoats, have claimed that homosexuality is a ""white man's"" thing, etc and there are others that have attempted to cover up any evidence of homosexuality existing pre-colonization. So after 1960, the UK and the West became more tolerant of homosexuality, but this was at the same time that Africa had and was still being decolonized. Homophobic laws had been present for several generations now, and people in Africa seeing increasing acceptance for homosexuality in the West from '60 onwards would regard such acceptance as a Western thing. Even though the homophobic laws date back to Western intervention, they date back beyond living memory and are ingrained in African culture, whereas the increasing acceptance in the West is seen as something new, and something that many in a newly independent state would want to avoid. The homophobic laws are seen as African and something to be retained, whereas homosexuality is now a Western thing, or a ""white man's thing"" (as you can imagine there is resentment to both the West and the ""white man"" in some former colonies). African values, which would now include an aversion to homosexuality, would be strongly emphasized in newly independent countries, at the same time as when the West started to go the opposite way.

It's worth thinking about how long it took for homosexuality to be fully legalized over here as well. While [Laws in Uganda prohibiting same-sex sexual acts were first put in place under British colonial rule in the 19th century, and enshrined in 1950 in the Penal Code,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Uganda) sodomy was outlawed in the 16th century over here. In 1967 the law was only changed so that two men, age 21 and over, and with no other persons present could have sex (this law was interpreted to mean having sex in a hotel or in a house where someone else wasn't even in the same room, but just in the house, was illegal), and it was only in 2000 when an equal age of consent was enforced (after several proposals in earlier years had been defeated and the European Commission of Human Rights found the unequal ages of consent to be in violation of the EU Convention of Human Rights.) During the time that the laws have changed in the UK, religious influence in the country has been decreasing, and social attitudes have become increasingly liberal. In many parts of Africa however, religious fundamentalism has increased and played a big role in society, and attitudes are much more conservative on social issues.  So we've only very recently become more tolerant, as we have also become far less religious, whereas Africa is far more religious (even though I've mainly mentioned Christianity, Islam has also played it's part). 

That includes a lot of generalizations though, and it's worth noting that South Africa for example legalized gay marriage in 2006. (although even so, a recent survey showed South Africa to be significantly below the UK in terms of social acceptance for homosexuality [with 32% surveyed in SA thinking it should be accepted vs 76% of Brits](http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/)

TL;DR: Religious fundamentalism and missionaries + homophobia ingrained into culture and homosexuality now seen as ""un-African"" have played a big part in the laws remaining in place. That's not to absolve the countries that have not repealed the laws, at all, but it is worth noting the events that led to such laws being introduced and retained, and why they are not so readily repealed. None of this is an excuse for the abhorrent homophobia present, but the Western impact on modern African culture does need to be recognized.",0,1396725894,null,0,1396726201,0,cgkvuhc,t3_229ln6,t1_cgkvuhc,t1_cgkt43l,null,1433223659,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,maybelying,null,null,"&gt; Additionally, the saving of Gallifrey specifically, occurred in 12s timeline. No one before him would remember. Which is why 11 doesn't know for sure he saved Gallifrey in Time of the Doctor at first.

I'm waiting to see where they're going with this.  For now, my head canon is that since Twelve didn't interact with the other doctors, Eleven's time stream didn't go out of synch.  There was no paradox to prevent if he didn't perceive his future self as being there.  I attribute his not being sure if Galifrey was saved or not to the fact that they had no idea what was going to happen to Gallifrey or where it would wind up.

I also like the theory that Twelve's presence there had nothing to do with saving Gallifrey on the last day, and is related to some future episode involving the return of Gallifrey or a mystery around what happened that day.  He may have intentionally stayed quiet and hidden from them to prevent interfering with their actions.

My problem with the sequence of events as presented is that the plan to save Gallifrey came from Eleven.  It was at Clara's instigation that he backed away from pressing the button and then revealed a plan instead.  That implies that War Doc couldn't have passed through that event to progress forward in his time line (eventually becoming Eleven) without Eleven being there.  That's too much of a paradox to have to accept when the simpler solution is that War Doc did, in fact, press the button and then the future Doctors changed their past.

Perhaps if the sequence of events had been that War Doc, in a moment of conscience before pressing the button, decided instead to try and push Gallifrey out of the universe when Ten and Eleven appeared and threw his time stream out of synch, I could buy the ""he just forgot"" argument.  From War Doc's perspective his time line progressed as it was intended.  But they told the story from Eleven's perspective, and that changes it.

EDIT:

Also, adding in this dialog snippit that sort of re-inforces my point:

&gt; ELEVEN: Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this. I've changed my mind.
&gt;
&gt; WAR DOC: There's still a billion billion Daleks up there, attacking.
&gt;
&gt; ELEVEN: Yeah, there is. There is.
&gt;
&gt; TEN: But there's something those billion billion Daleks don't know.
&gt;
&gt; ELEVEN: Because if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements.
&gt;
&gt; CLARA: What? What don't they know?
&gt;
&gt; DOCTOR: **This time**, there's three of us.

So in Uganda for example, the British implemented homophobic laws, in writing, in 1950, in Uganda's penal code, after having introduced such laws initially in the 19th century. That penal code is from just over 60 years ago, and not really a bunch of dead British people, the people who implemented those laws could still be alive for all I know.  Uganda was only decolonized in 1962, which is literally just over 50 years ago. That's not to absolve such countries from still retaining homophobic laws, but the British institution of such a law certainly is relevant. 


I know that countries that were colonized by the French such as Mali and Niger had a rich history of literature, (The University of Timbuktu was established in the 12th century). Egyptian literature certainly existed long before Egypt became part of the British Empire.

It's not true that many places hadn't seen the wheel, it was that the wheel was not commonly used in sub-Saharan Africa prior to colonization. 

I can't [access the full article currently](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7890041), although I may be able to through Uni, but the extract states

&gt; One of the most important differences in technology between Africa south of the Sahara during the pre-colonial period and many other areas of the world, it is frequently suggested, was the almost complete absence in the former of any form of wheeled transport. The transport of goods overland in pre-colonial sub-Saharan Africa was normally done by pack animals, where these were available, or more generally by human porterage. This lack of wheeled transport, it might be argued, had crucial implications for the history of sub-Saharan Africa, since the high cost of transport by pack animals and human porterage has often been presented as one of the principal constraints upon the expansion of trade, and hence of economic growth generally, in pre-colonial times. The lack of wheels in sub-Saharan Africa, it is clear, cannot have been due simply to ignorance, since many areas of the continent had been in contact with wheel-using civilizations outside Africa for several centuries before the colonial conquest at the end of the nineteenth century. Indeed, as this article will show, there is abundant evidence that, in West Africa at least, the technology of wheeled transport was quite widely known, though put to only very limited use, in the pre-colonial period. The reasons why this technology, although readily available, was nevertheless not generally adopted are, however, very far from being clear.

Now whilst I'm being quite derogatory towards the person, they were in fact one of the spokesmen for a vocal group in the environmental movement, unfortunately time has washed away the memory of which specific group. 

The hippie was adamant that the national grid would be done away with, areas would have their own local power generation capabilities that served only that town/city and nothing else. 

When asked about Reading specifically, which statistically is one of the most overcast cities in the UK,  not a lot of wind and is nowhere near the sea.   The hippies answer was: Turn it in to farm land then. If it can't sustain itself locally it should be bulldozed. 

He had no answer beyond a well worked ""sucks to be them"" when it was pointed out that 380,000+ people would be made homeless, countless businesses would be destroyed as would chunks of the road &amp; rail infrastructure (which he did argue would be shut down anyway if they ever got in to power), so you can't even say it was the usual Londoner who's never been beyond the M25's attitude either.

Yeah... I'm all for letting the opposing view have it's say and all but honestly letting a complete nutter in front of the camera is ... well yeah not good but since that specific interview I've had zero faith in the BBC News service and honestly, whilst I may agree with some of the goals of the Environmental movement it made it abundantly clear they should NEVER get any form of power beyond a garden party.

Basically there's 2 main ways of setting up a business, the first is sole trader and the second is limited company.

As a sole trader, all profit is counted as income and you're taxed the same way someone is on PAYE.

As a limited company, the profits are the company's and not the ""owners"". The company pays corporation tax on them. Now the ""owner"", usually the sole director/shareholder,  can get paid in one of two ways *(NB - this is simplistic for the purposes of aiding understanding)*:

1) Draw a wage. You then pay tax on your wage as any employee would. The wage is a tax deductible expense for the business so it doesn't pay tax on it thus avoiding double taxation but it would pay employers NI.

2) You are a shareholder of the limited company and the money is paid as a dividend. This is taken from post tax profit and is not tax deductible. You pay tax on it but then are given tax relief roughly equivalent to the corporation tax to avoid double taxation. The advantage of taking money this way is the company doesn't pay employers NI.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As I said in the linked comment, we did cultivate a culture in which homosexuality was seen as abhorrent and immoral; which did not already exist to such an extent in Africa. That's not to say homophobia was not present at all in pre colonial Africa, but the whole conception of sexuality was completely different. It was colonialism that eradicated common same sex rituals or matings in African countries. Britain cultivated a homophobic culture enshrined in law dating back to the 16th century (when it was punishable by death, until 1861), and it took us until the second half of the 20th century to start rectifying this. 

We introduced punishment of same sex activity in Africa in the 19th century, and pulled out of the continent after having instilled a homophobic culture, as well as fucking up a lot of other stuff. By no means do I mean to absolve the homophobic climate present in these countries at all, but without the Christian missionaries from the US and the criminalization of homosexuality by Britain, such a climate may never have emerged. The extreme extent to which it has gone now is on themselves, but it's been fuelled by US missionaries. Islam and Christianity introduced religious fundamentalism that persecuted LGBT people, and as religious influence died down in the UK and tolerance for LGBT grew, the opposite occurred in Africa. Of course both Christianity and Islam entered Africa long before colonialism, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence of homophobic laws being implemented in Africa prior to colonization.

(South Africa did actually move forward faster than the UK in terms of the law, legalizing same sex marriage in 2006, but SA is still generally a lot more homophobic than the UK)
