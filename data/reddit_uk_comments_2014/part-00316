This implies Rodgers is at least partially to blame, does it not? Your first paragraph of your most recent post even implies Rodgers has been poor in the transfer market and the committee was brought in because of this. You're simultaneously arguing separate points and contradicting yourself in the process. Perhaps a more annoying habit, if you ask me.

The committee was always planned and happened to coincide with your presented timeline, and you've been happy to attach this narrative with little knowledge of the actualities. FSG were very open with how they planned to operate the club and it was clear a transfer committee was always in their plans. Do you not remember their initial search for a DoF to work alongside Rodgers? This is consistent with the whole transfer committee philosophy. Borini and Allen were Rodgers signings but the committee wasn't formed because of any failing on his part. It is the systematic inefficiency of the traditional process that FSG looked to change in applying a model more in keeping with American sports, like the system in place at the Red Sox.

&gt; And I do blame the committee as it is Hunter and Fallows that wanted Markovic and Balotelli.

How can you say that she provided adequate justification while agreeing that the poll was flawed? her choice of a poll that was designed to produce the answer she herself supported is *ipso facto* in bad faith.

&gt; It takes out the personal element ('your child') which is a very significant factor and adds details like 'stable, long-term relationship' which is also designed to make the prospect more attractive.

On the complete contrary, the poll asks the respondents to evalute the real-life case that the law would regulate: a child that is almost certainly not theirs being adopted by a stable, long-term gay or lesbian couple. The stability of the couple is absolutely a pertinent detail, because it's the chief prerequisite for any couple considering adoption; if the poll had added ""rich"" or ""educated"", which are not pertinent details, then you would have a point.",0,1414115373,null,0,false,0,cli4po1,t3_2jzxyv,t1_cli4po1,t1_cli48qp,null,1426379059,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

With respect to the committee setup, we'll have to agree to disagree about that.  One of the biggest reservations Rodger's seemingly had about the job was that of a DoF controlling his signings and he was pretty clear that he wanted full control.  I don't believe for a second he's at all happy about the committee setup and I very much doubt he's an advocate for it at all.  

This was oft talked about back in April 2013 or so when it was 'unveiled' and on many other forums (not sure about here as I wasn't here back then) and articles the general consensus was it certainly was not something Rodgers was particularly happy about or wanted.
As one [example](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/10004873/Liverpool-transfers-to-be-decided-by-committee-not-Brendan-Rodgers-claims-Ian-Ayre.html):

""Although the current model is one FSG has always favoured, there is a noticeable shift from last summer when Rodgers made it known that he would not work for a director of football, and any recruitment team around him would be “underpinning” his work.

“It’s absolute madness if you are the manager of the club and someone else tells you to have that player,” he said last July. “It doesn’t work.” ""

With respect to Balotelli and Markovic being advocated by Hunter and Fallows, it is something I believe to be fact based upon careful consideration and statements made by others who I personally have no reason to doubt and many reasons to believe.  Call it opinion, if you prefer, but for me it's a fact.  ",0,1414120934,null,0,false,0,cli7gtx,t3_2k4p9b,t1_cli7gtx,t1_cli427n,null,1426377774,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

false,Lauranis,UnionFlag,"Plymouth, 2007 XVS1300A","I taught myself by starting out easy, wider roads and shorter filtering distances. Look at your normal route, are there any places that you regularly found yourself stopped at lights behind one or two cars (in a two lane road)? Quite simply, rather than stopping behind that one car, slow down and ease your way in between them. From there steadily build your way up. As a general rule, avoid stopping then deciding to filter (as you then have to work your way out from behind a stopped car and other bikes may be filtering) it should be a smooth, confident manoeuvre, other road users will respond better to confident filtering than hesitant (they see a hesitant filter as someone trying to queue jump, whilst acting confidently asserts it as something legitimate). It is all about building confidence and experience at reading traffic and road circumstances.

As far as what is allowed, well, the highway code is surprisingly bereft of any real comment on it, keep your speed low relative to other traffic, and in general don't filter through traffic moving close to the speed limit. I tend to limit my filtering to only essentially static queue's, and It still vastly improves my commuting experience. Like all riding, don't filter angry or stressed, keep it relaxed and not aggressive.

As a side note, as you have just passed your mod 2, go put and practice your low speed handling, practice until you can almost be at a standstill and be comfortable. Filtering can involve some tricky riding if you make mistakes, but sometimes those mistakes are unavoidable, the traffic spacing changes or someone tries to block you",0,1414124900,null,0,false,0,cli940x,t3_2k4d2c,t1_cli940x,t3_2k4d2c,null,1426376952,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

TARDIS's were equipt with ""chameleon circuits"" that allowed them to scan the area they were landing and pick a form to let them blend in seamlessly so the Time-Lords could stick to their laws of not intervening in the history of the planets they were observing. The Doctor's TARDIS did this until he had it parked in a junkyard on Earth in 1963, police boxes were out of date at the time and so the TARDIS picked it to blend into that junkyard. Since that time, every time the Doctor goes somewhere the TARDIS runs a massive scan of the area, figures out the best disguise and then completely disregards that and makes itself a police box. The 6th Doctor managed to temporarily fix it actually but it didn't ""stick."" The Doctor is also a renegade with 0 regard for the laws of his people so he seems to actually prefer it being broken.

&gt;why does it care about the Doctor?

It was an outdated model that was under repairs when he stole it. Since it is out dated, it would have been locked away somewhere if he hadn't stolen it. Not to mention, Time-Lords were supposed to have each trip authorized by their government. It's probably happy to be out flying around the universe free of all the red tape.

When the war ended, America was in a brilliant position - they had virtually no bomb damage to their country (the Japanese paper balloon bombs only killed around 8 people iirc and damaged nothing more than a couple of houses and some fields, and the one sub-carried plane the Japanese launched only burned a small area of woodland), plus they had masses of new factories which, for a relatively small capital outlay, could stop making bombs and tanks and planes and guns and start making refrigerators and cars and cocktail ice shavers and televisions. 

Plus thanks to the fact that the US population had essentially been on permanent overtime for 5 years they had a lot of spare cash to spend on these new luxury goods that weren't available during the war. So they went into a massive spending spree which lasted until the early 1960s. And America itself was owed vast amounts of money by Britain and France and the other allies because of all the lend-lease support they had been giving during the war.

All of this combined meant that America left the war in a very good economic position, ready to expand her role on the world stage now that they had learned that ""peace at home means peace everywhere else as well"" as it was put at the time. They also had lots and lots of cargo ships that were built during the war, which were immediately available to start exporting luxuries and essentials again, bringing in more money for the USA.

Britain, on the other hand, was still in the throes of rationing, had massive amounts of debt (we were spending £42,000,000 a day on the war *in 1940s pounds*, which is worth a heck of a lot more now), and we owed a ton of money to the USA (which was only completely repaid in 2006). We also had masses of destroyed houses that we had to rebuild, factories had to be rebuilt after being bombed, the railways needed a complete overhaul (which they never really got), and because the British public and industry had been heavily taxed during the war, no one had any money to spend on any luxuries, not that any were available because we weren't making them. We also had very little to export and we were still trying to rebuild our reserves of all the goods we had to import.

So the late 1940s/1950s was really the transition point between Britain and the USA being the pre-eminent global power. ",0,1414135263,null,0,false,0,clic0qi,t3_2k3tkq,t1_clic0qi,t1_cli0nxz,null,1426375524,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

You might argue that the over 60's have more savings etc, and you'd have a point there too, but I would counter that with the fact that the over 60's have contributed more. 

And I don't think it's ridiculous (though I think this whole argument got ridiculous a while ago), I think it's worth discussing. I think that there is a discussion to be had about contribution, need and right. I don't think a healthy, educated, able 18-20 year old has much of a position from which to demand anything. 

And I know people have accused me of creating an argument that would be used to justify lower wages for women or disabled people (things got really silly around then), but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm being specific. Disabled people have different needs, and women and men should have equal pay across categories, which I'm sure we can all agree on.

At the time of the war of independence almost no one in the UK was entitled to vote. For example, Manchester, already a large industrial city and one of the big money makers for the UK, had no MPs at all to represent it. 

So why, if millions of British people didn't have representation, should representation have been given to people three thousand miles away who were running away from being persecuted due to their religion in many cases?

The real reason they decided to leave was just because the hot-heads of the time invented some reasons why they should go, and they fought and went. For example, the tax issue - almost no taxes were levied against the Americans - they paid 4x less in tax than anyone in the UK, and almost all their tax ended up paying for the soldiers defending them from hostile Native American attacks.

false,Captain_English,null,null,"No, quite the opposite. For the reasons you've highlighted, what the law says is the only thing that matters here.

We agree that underage sex is harmful, right?

We agree that exploitative sex is harmful, right?

We agree that, as people get older, they are more able to deal with the process and consequences of sex (first harm) and are also more able to independently decide if it's what they actually want to do (second point), right?

And we also agree that this process is a continual thing that happens over time, not a click your fingers let's fuck kind of thing, yeah?

Ok.

So the state has a duty to protect its citizens from harm. That's kind of the point of it. This means that it must weigh up situations to decide at what point it should intervene and make a law, because there's a balance point where the harm of having no law outweighs the harm of putting one in place.

Now with the age of consent, let's do a thought experiment with 100 girls (although obviously it's gender neutral).

At age 14, 3 girls are (we think) mature and independent minded enough to have sex without harm. 30 girls are mature enough to have sex but insufficiently independent that they can't be readily manipulated by someone. 67 girls are neither mature enough nor independent enough.

At age 16, that same sample has 85 girls both independent and mature enough to have sex, and 15 who still aren't really ready.

Hence it is decided that the age of consent is 16. While a minority of girls can meaningly consent at 14, the majority cannot; to allow sex to freely occur at this age would do more harm than the 'good' of letting those three 14 year olds have their full freedoms early. At 16, it's gone the other way, so the law says 'ok, it's mostly not harmful by this point.' The fact that different places have different ages of consent simply means they balance the probability of harm differently - but ALL of them agree there's a point where harm is significantly likely.

It's obviously not as black and white as this: someone at 14 might feel like they're ready and they really really do love their teacher, but in truth if they have sex with that person they're going to be emotionally damaged about it for life. Or they might not, and they'll be fine. You just don't know. What you do know is that in most cases at that age, it's the bad option.

Now there's a hugely important consequence of this: it's that the law has to be enforced as a blanket ban, or it means nothing. It's there to protect the 97% who aren't ready for sex, and in allowing it to be compromised here and there you totally remove that protection.

When we think about the harms of child abuse in the 70s and 80s, we're not really talking about whether or not the specific 14 year old in question could consent, we're talking about an adult who willingly broke the law and had sex with a minor. You can't let them off because the person was happy about it at the time! What happens if they did it with three people, two of which suffered no ill affects and one did. Oh, but your honour, the first two 14 year olds I fucked were fine, and you let me off then, so you can see it's an honest mistake! S/he should be happy for the other two you let me shag, because they loved it!

Get my point?

Sorry to continue this nonsense, I'm sure you're over it by now. That said:

&gt;First you're using entitled as a pejorative term.
Then you're then explaining that entitled means expecting things to be given to you because ""you're you""

Yes I am using it pejoratively. It's the sense of expectation that I take umbrage with. The ""I'm 18 now, I'm an adult, give me stuff."" That's what I mean by ""just because you're you"".

&gt;They do if they're performing the same task to the same standard.

My point is that they 18-20 year olds are less likely to perform at the same standard as older people because while I don't think that 

&gt;there's some universal rule that older people are better coffee baristas.

I do think that older people would take being baristas more seriously. It's precisely the ""Oh, it's only a barista/waitress/cleaning job"" attitude that is so prevalent in younger ""entitled"" people that I was referring to.

&gt;If you don't believe the minimum wage should be the minimum wage for everybody, why believe in a minimum wage at all? Maybe you think disabled people should have a lower minimum too?

This annoyed me, I'll be honest. I think it's a low blow, implying I am prejudiced against disabled people. Of course I don't think that. I don't think you can actually compare the needs of abled 18-20 year olds and the needs of disabled people. It's a little grandiose don't you think? And quite childish. I was referring to abled, financially stable 18-20 year olds. The majority. I'm being specific, so please don't cast me as hateful, and don't try and raise the ""struggle"" of the young and privileged to the same level as the very real problems disabled people face, because it's just insulting.

And finally, I am worth more than 18-20 year olds, as a fact. I charge more than I did at 18 because I'm more experienced and better. Better in every way in fact. That's the way it is for everybody. It's called progression. But if young people want to get upset about it that's fine. They'll realise when they're older that they were wrong. Embarrassingly so. But that's the point of youth, making embarrassing mistakes. Unless of course, you were better when you were 18? Maybe it's all gone downhill for you from there? In which case I'm sorry.

There you go then. That's me replied properly for the record. Like I say, sorry to dredge it up, I'm sure you're well past it now. Have a lovely day.",0,1414137759,null,0,false,0,cliciyb,t3_2k2v8v,t1_cliciyb,t1_clhfetl,null,1426375288,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

- What options have you been given for accommodation?  Are you making your own arrangements or being put up in halls?

- I'm sorry I'm a bit too old to know where the cool kids hang out these days :/ as an overview the options are generally in town, i.e. the clubs and pubs by the bullring shopping centre or on Broad Street, campus itself (they have a couple of bars and a truly disgusting but arguably very cheap night called Fab at the student guild) or Selly Oak, which is the student residential area right by the campus.  

Selly has all the studenty pubs and is cheaper than town, but isn't quite as popular with first years because it's on the wrong side of campus from first year halls. Rest of the years tend to hang out this side though.  

Town has a lot of places but they are more pricey because their clientele aren't just students.  Having said that student nights often have good deals and they're proactive about flyering the students to tell you when those are.

- words of wisdom... Well, I think you're going to enjoy it here!  It's a lovely uni on a nice campus and it's a very friendly place.  Oh!  I have some: it rains here. Like, rains A LOT and torrentially when it does.  It can be fine for weeks then suddenly: downpour.

How exactly did the EU commission go about calculating tax on business that is inherently difficult to track? Are they just guessing? Does that mean that France and Germany had less prostitutes and illegal drugs in the last 20 years?

My point is, they weren't expecting this money, and to tax someone after the fact is a perfect recipe for animosity between all involved. If they had said ""going forward we're going to calculate GDP this way for all future payments"" then I don't think it would be so bad.

My point is that *age shouldn't come into it*. You should get paid for the job you do, regardless of what age you are.

The point of a minimum wage is to prevent employers exploiting workers. 

It's not to legislatively force employers to reward workers with higher wages for ""experience"" that you think might exist.

&gt;I think it's a low blow, implying I am prejudiced against disabled people.

I'm not implying you're prejudiced against disabled people. I'm just applying your own logic.

Your justification is that young people should have a lower minimum wage because you believe they'll perform the job to a poorer standard. That's the same logic Lord Freud used to justify a lower minimum wage for the disabled.

The reason you're reluctant to apply your own logic to the disabled is that you think that idea is unpalatable but you consider young people ""fair game"".

As has been said by others, there aren't mainly laws regarding it, apart from a few definite ""do not do this.""

The main don'ts:

* do not pass the zig zags at crossings if it's in use [ie, a red light, or a zebra crossing]. If it's green, or no peds in sight, it's fine, but do it carefully.

* do not cross over a solid line. [question for others on my own uncertainty - if the traffic is actually stopped, do the white line rules come in to play here, where we can over take?]

* do not go on the wrong side of traffic islands.

Other than that, it's mainly guidelines and experience that come in to play.  
- I aim to not go more than half the speed limit of the road [give or take 5mph].  
- remember to check your mirrors [for others filtering that want to go faster than you]  
- the tricky one: look ahead as much as you can; for spots to pull in when you have to, for cars indicating, peds at the side of the road or emerging between cars, for junctions where other vehicles will come out. But you must also make sure you keep checking close in front too for sudden changes.

Sorry but as a recruiter, you and /u/LordAnubis12 should know that this is an immediate warning light in the eyes of most recruiters. 

We work weekly with hundreds of people who are more than happy to disclose their current salary and package details. We consider it important to know because the following scenario can – and does – happen, if we don’t thoroughly investigate: 

*We speak to someone about a job offering £30k. We make a job application for them and everything goes swimmingly. It comes to offer time and they’re offered £30k. Great. But wait – they didn’t mention the bonus scheme that they see yearly, the company car, the other incentives and bonuses and OT pay that brings their total yearly package to nearer £35k. They’re not interested in a £30k offer. They want £35k.* 

Now what happens next? 

The client wants to know why we didn’t properly qualify the salary expectations of this person. Why didn’t we ask those questions? What do we mean when we say ‘they didn’t want to discuss their salary package’ and why didn’t we find out about all the benefits? The deal falls through – the candidate can’t be offered that much and feels their time was wasted and the client is upset that we didn’t do our jobs. 

It’s that simple. In order to seek a salary and package you WANT we need to know what you have and why you’d be worth more. 

Hiding that raises alarm bells – especially when everyone else we speak to that day is not going to protest at discussing it.

You'd be hard pressed to find a single Cabinet minister who is an expert in their field.

And this is what I believe is what's wrong with our politics today.  In the real world you wouldn't put a plumber in charge of a hospital, or let a car mechanic run a school.  So why are we letting a bunch of wealthy lawyers run the NHS, our schools, our police, etc?  These are the wrong people for the job, and only in politics is such an absurdity deemed acceptable.

I was explaining what I meant by ""entitled"". You're taking it out of context.

&gt;It's not to legislatively force employers to reward workers with higher wages for ""experience"" that you think might exist.

I'm not saying that that's WHY the difference in pay is there (I've already explained that it makes the young more employable, as have many others - theres a great post further up the page explaining why it makes good economic sense, read it). I'm saying that the difference in experience justifies it. Are you saying that if someone is better at their job than someone else, they shouldn't be paid more? 

&gt;The reason you're reluctant to apply your own logic to the disabled is that you think that idea is unpalatable but you consider young people ""fair game"".

Bullshit. It doesn't apply. You cannot compare an able bodied 18-20 year olds needs and requirements to the needs of the disabled community. I'm trying to be specific and you're trying to paint me as something I'm not. THAT I find unpalatable. If you'd like to play that game then your statements: 

&gt;I'm not implying you're prejudiced against disabled people. I'm just applying your own logic.
Your justification is that young people should have a lower minimum wage because you believe they'll perform the job to a poorer standard. That's the same logic Lord Freud used to justify a lower minimum wage for the disabled.

Imply that you think a disabled person is incapable of doing as good a job as an able bodied person. And that's YOU applying that, not me. Which smells like prejudice. See? Bullshit, isn't it. So why don't we get leave the attempts at muck stirring and get back to the specific fucking point. Don't compare me to Freud, don't paint me as victimising the poor, misunderstood youth, don't say I'm after ""fair game"". It makes you come across as a self righteous prick.

&gt; interesting video, but wages / rental yields would also need to double or nobody will be able to afford to pay the increased prices.

Correct, and we're now in a period where income hasn't matched house prices.

http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5709/housing/housing-market-stats-and-graphs/

The reason I say that is because I recently moved from Sydney, Australia, which has house prices similar to London. For decades, people have said that the house prices can't keep going up in Sydney, but they did.  There was a lot of wishful thinking but the harsh reality was that house prices would keep on marching upwards.

Nothing is done to help it. There is loads of foreign investment, population increases, as does immigration, and every year not enough new houses are built. There are other influences, e.g. transport infrastructure in Sydney is pretty crap, so people pay a premium to be close to the centre of the city.

I don't see London/UK as being much different. It has similar property price motivators.

I understand that house prices don't double *everywhere* but I did see a definite ripple effect from the centre of Sydney as people gradually got priced out and had to move further away from the centre of the city. 

I was living in Leicestershire previously, where I could get a decent 3br house for about £150K. But there weren't many (well paid) jobs for me there. Now I'm in Cambridgeshire and the same house is almost double, but there are jobs here.  When I look back at my decision to move, I think I'm actually in a worse position with regards to my wage/house-price ratio. 

EDIT: I'm not saying population increase and immigration are bad things, just that they haven't been taken in to account when building houses and infrastructure.

false,DaveChild,null,null,"Well, that was an interesting read, though sadly seems to be based on misunderstanding and hyperbole. Here's the meat of the piece, with some clarifications from [the actual bill](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2014-2015/0043/15043.pdf) (see section 70-77). And to be clear, I'm not a lawyer.

&gt; First, it restricts the use of protective costs. 

Protective costs are when you are allowed to initiate a judicial review and - if you lose - the costs you then have to pay are limited. This is, on the face of it, intended to allow a small fish to go up against a big fish, and not have the disparity of resources be the deciding factor. Or have the small fish simply not bring the action at all for fear of the costs.

But protective cost orders are still available - they are granted when the permission is given for the judicial review. I don't get what the problem is here at all. You still need to apply for permission for the judicial review, and your own costs are the same in doing so. And your liability for losing costs can still be capped, under the same criteria as before.

And of course only a few of these are granted - it effectively is saying that if you are the defendant in a judicial review and you win, you might still end up significantly out of pocket. So, you potentially could do nothing wrong and end up with financial costs anyway! That should be a rare occurrence.

&gt; Second, it exposes friends, relatives and associates of a claimant to financial costs. 

This seems like a pretty simple misunderstanding of the proposed change. The clause they are referring to is:

&gt; The court or tribunal must consider whether to order costs to be paid by a person, other than a party to the proceedings, who is identified in that information as someone who is providing financial support for the purposes of the proceedings or likely or able to do so.

The ""that information"" they are referring to, and the part of the bill they are referring to, is the actual petition to begin judicial review. So, if you apply for judicial review, and in your application you say that funding is coming from, or likely to come from, or may come from, a specific source, then the court can consider those sources when awarding costs.

The change is there to prevent the situation where a shell company is set up specifically to instigate a judicial review. When this has happened before, it has left the winning defendant out of pocket, as there was nobody to pay the costs incurred in defence.

It doesn't mean that costs can go against you and the court can demand money from your relatives or colleagues. (Although, a court could probably do that as it stands anyway, being a court and all.)

&gt; Third, it makes charities and NGOs who get involved in a case liable for costs. 

I think this is the same as the above, though the author really didn't provide any more information about this. It's an absurd misunderstanding - the same one - to state that experts might also be liable for costs.

&gt; And fourth, it shields public bodies which have acted unlawfully from public scrutiny.

They are talking about the ""no-difference threshhold"", which means that you can't have a judicial review ""if it appears to the court to be highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would not have been substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred"". Or, to put it another way, if it made no difference to the outcome, you can't have a judicial review. Which sounds sensible, and in no way ""shields public bodies which have acted unlawfully from public scrutiny"".

For every claim there is a null hypothesis, if you can't sufficiently prove your claim you can't reject the null hypothesis, it doesn't mean you're entirely wrong- that I would have to prove but you can't claim you're right either and I have picked apart your argument on the basis that the religion reason cited may be part of a wider precedent in sentencing that does not necessarily mean that minorities get lenient sentences.

&gt;Are you a legal expert? If not, you're in no position to judge in the face of the overwhelming evidence I've provided you in about 5 minutes of searching.

You've posted articles of court cases out of context without any comprehensive analysis.

Am I forgetting anyone?

I don't recall Balotelli and Lambert starting a game together and I believe it would allow our playmakers more options going up the pitch. Balotelli has specifically stated that he plays better with another striker, and Lambert needs an opportunity to prove his worth. Couts, Sterling, and Lallana showed an impressive link-up during the Madrid match. Hendo can come in later for Lallana. I believe Johnson's performances has been very solid since coming back on the team, but Manquillo deserves a chance to perform as well. He hasn't had a overtly poor performance since joining the team. Sterling is obviously missing, but I think he needs rest. I would like Gerrard to get some rest, but he'll obviously be in the game at some point.

Looks like the cheapest buy-to-let mortgages have initial interest rates of 2.5%ish, so a couple more percent on interest rates could leave even average landlords making a loss. And if yields on other investments start to rise it'll make investing in being a landlord relatively less attractive, too.

Landlords may go on making losses relative to other uses for their money for a while, but not forever. That means either rents will have to rise or property prices fall (all relative to wages), otherwise landlords will leave the market.

For a long time I've been wondering if we'll see an exodus of 30-something rental emigrants wanting a stable place to live to start a family....maybe when EU economic conditions change we'll see it. An exodus to sunnier and cheaper climates of people with inadequate pensions might do it, too.

I'll preface this by saying I've rented for 10 years, from university to now, so I've some experience of renting. It's fine when you're a student and you want to escape home, study and remain very mobile. I was able to move at very short notice for jobs once I started work and that was useful.

**BUT**... once you hit about 27-30 renting turns very sour. Your priorities change and you start to want stability over mobility. I wouldn't want to have children in an environment where we can be evicted with 4 weeks notice and very little time to find alternative arrangements... or where the walls can go mouldy and threaten their health, but we have virtually no means to fix it if the landlord wants to be a prick.

Rental law in the UK needs to change radically if people are going to start renting into their 30s. For a start there will need to be proper long term tenancies like the Germans have, where you can rent for a minimum term of 3-10 years and can only be evicted in the very strictest of conditions... like non-payment of rent. If the landlord claims they are going to sell a house in Germany and evict you, then don't sell, you can actually take them to court for unfair eviction! We would also need proper health and safety laws applied to rentals with an inspection agency that could force, at extremely short notice, landlords to make major repairs to a property. 

Besides all that they should look into things like rental caps - these are used widely in the USA and help prevent situations like you had in the Olympics, where long term tenants were being evicted so landlords could make a quick buck out of Olympic tourists paying up to 10 times as much over a short period. 

**Anyway, the tl:dr is I don't think we are wrong for wanting to own. This isn't just a British obsession**. If they want more people to rent, then they need to make renting more like owning - as it is in Europe.

&gt;

&gt;A __mobile phone__ (also known as a __cellular phone__, __cell phone__, __hand phone__, or simply a __phone__) is a [phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) that can make and receive [telephone calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_call) over a [radio link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Link_Protocol) while moving around a wide geographic area. It does so by connecting to a [cellular network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network) provided by a [mobile phone operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_operator), allowing access to the [public telephone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSTN). By contrast, a [cordless telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordless_telephone) is used only within the short range of a single, private base station.

&gt;In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_services) such as [text messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging), [MMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service), [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email), Internet access, short-range wireless communications ([infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_port), [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)), business applications, gaming, and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone).

&gt;The first hand-held cell phone was demonstrated by [John F.

This, however, is daylight robbery. The amount they have demanded is an extra 20% on the contributions the UK **already makes** for this year. And they have demanded that the UK pay it to them within 6 weeks.

If you are earning anything as a tax payer in the UK it would be a serious fuck up if HMRC suddenly said you had underpaid your taxes by 20%. That sort of an error isn't going to happen unless there's fraud involved.

Even then they will never ask you the pay back the amount in a lump sum, let alone within 6 weeks of being told about it. Your tax rate for the following year (or contributions for the following year) would be adjusted to take account of the money owed and to recoup it progressively. Asking for 20% of your **yearly** contribution within 6 weeks is utter madness.

false,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I'll post some points from the discussion at /r/ukpolitics.

I think we could fix the housing crisis with a few simple policies:

* __Enact a Land Value Tax__ - this will encourage land and property owners to either make it productive or to return it to the care of the state. It actually passed the Commons in the People's Budget of 1910 led by Churchill and Lloyd George but was vetoed by the Lords even when the King himself advised they pass the bill - the resulting crisis led to the Parliament Act but the version of the bill that finally passed had the Land Value Tax removed. This policy has often won the support of many economists and been covered favourably in The Economist. __Tl;dr if we were a democracy we would have this already__

* __Repeal [Protected Views](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_view) legislation__ - This prevents us from building tall high-density residential housing which are commonplace in cities around the world, although they have a stigma in the UK that needn't be the case and indeed many residential skyscrapers cater to the professional and luxury markets

* __Relax greenbelt restrictions__ - Despite popular beliefs [__very little of the UK is developed on__](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096) and we can still build many new settlements and expand existing towns without losing the countryside. This has the advantage over brownfield development in that many current developments cannot support much higher populations easily due to difficult infrastructure limits such as water supply

* __Create retirement towns__ - The retired population no longer requires work and so providing incentives to move to areas that could support a larger population but fail to attract it due to a lack of employment opportunities would free up housing in high-demand areas and help stimulate the economy in low-employment regions. An example of one such incentive could be to subsidise council tax payments (either partially or wholly).

* __Reduce the power of NIMBYs__ - Relaxing the process of planning permission would reduce to power of NIMBYs to block developments, one doesn't want to entirely ignore the local community, but similarly we cannot allow those with vested interests to damage the nation as a whole

* __Ensure good building standards__ - This may seem like it would make it harder to build and indeed it would. But there is no point in creating new housing stock that is poor-quality and will have to be demolished in a few years. Modern construction technology such as modular pre-fabricated housing should allow high-quality housing to be built cheaply and quickly without a danger of 'cookie-cutter' homes.




These are all things which are well within the power of a Government to do - it isn't vague complaining about a general economic malaise - and if done correctly would require no further effort on the part of the Government as it simply provides the correct incentives for the market to be able to meet the housing demand.

The housing crisis is causing extreme damage to our nation as it causes the wage cost for employers to rise as employees need to be able to afford housing yet the employees see none of the money as it goes straight to landlords or expensive mortgages. This is causing severe problems, especially in London, and we risk returning to the economic conditions of the early Victorian era where the idle landed classes extracted much of the wealth generated by productive business and industry causing much harm to economic development.

What worries me is that all parties will place their short-term political futures (which is the personal gain for individual MPs) above the long-term benefit to the nation and thus encourage further property speculation and continue to allow the prices to soar as they will not risk losing votes from those who would suffer reduced rental income or risk negative equity. 

That they will do this in spite of the damage to our economy is frightening but they seem happy to turn our nation into a playground for oil sheikhs and oligarchs as long as they may rule over it.


Some additional points from /u/yourlizardoverlord 

* **Use it or lose it planning permission**

[Property developers are sitting on 400,000 undeveloped plots of land with planning permission.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/hands-off-our-land/9522902/House-builders-sitting-on-400000-undeveloped-plots-of-land-with-planning-permission.html) They make most of their money from planning conversions and the appreciation of their land banks. Make them build houses or sell to someone else who will.

* **Social housing**

Taxpayers are paying over the odds in housing benefit. If we build plenty of social housing, this will keep house prices in check, and will pay for itself very quickly. 

* **Support self builds**

About 10% percent of new houses in the UK are self build. The build quality is usually streets ahead of the flimsy jerry-built rabbit hutches being thrown together by property developers. The government could simplify and streamline the planning process for self builds.

•Ownership continued to increase, reaching a peak of 69% in 2001, however in the last decade it has fallen to 64%. 

So 2001, well before crash and (boom of house prices) it was already 64%.....

Getting to 50% is no surprise then.   

What is needed is more houses (duh!) and maybe some rent control in some areas...

&gt;At first sight it sounds like an awful lot of money. In reality it is not that much although it may still be very hard to find.

&gt;The call is for the NHS budget to be £8bn higher not next year or the year after but by the end of the next parliament i.e. by 2020.

&gt;This is an above inflation or real terms increase of 1.5%. That's historically very low.

&gt;For example, even in the years of the ""Thatcher cuts"" the average annual rise in health spending was 3% (health inflation is said to be higher than inflation in the economy as a whole due to improving technology).

We do need to have some grown-up discussions about the role of the NHS though. In an era where medical science can keep people alive until they're 110, cure many cancers, extend the life expectancy of people with HIV, **regrow limbs and heal paralysis**... How much of that can we expect to come from the NHS? I strongly believe in a nationalised NHS that is ""free at the point of delivery"" for everyone, but where do we draw the line on what the NHS can deliver? We already know that *most* elective cosmetic treatments are private only, what should people be expected to live with unless they can afford to have it treated privately? 

How do we tell people ""I'm sorry, but you're not rich enough to xyz"". When xyz could be

* have your rare cancer cured  
* heal your ~~macro~~ macular-degeneration 
* walk again after paralysis  
* live until you're 90 while HIV positive

false,rev9of8,null,null,"That's nice. And anyone who listens to what you've said on this is doing themselves a disservice and placing themselves in a highly disadvantageous position given that there is a already a significant power imbalance in the relationship dynamics anyway. You are making it clear that you expect a prospective candidate to show their entire hand when you and the employer are not showing yours. It simply is not in any prospective employee's best interests to disclose their current package and it is not something that you as a recruiter or any prospective employer needs to know.  
  
Even in the example you gave you haven't justified the disclosing of the current package is in receipt of because you should have found out what additional benefits someone was expecting beforehand. It does not matter if my current job pays me bawbees and expects me to walk twenty miles to work through hailing sleet and piles of drifting snow. If a prospective employer is prepared to consider a million pound salary, a chauffeur driven limo to and from work each day and as much coke and hookers as I can take then I want that if I can get it.  
  
By telling you what I am currently receiving then both you and the employer will adjust any potential offer you may make accordingly and the reality is that it is pretty much guaranteed that any adjustment in offer that is a made will be in a downward direction from what you would have been prepared to offer as your starting position. It is simply not in anyone's best interests to disclose their current package to a recruiter or prospective employer.   
  
This is especially important as I do not know what relationship you as a recruiter have with a company and how you would be expected to be compensated by them and as such what may be motivating and incentivising you in the decisions you make. Do you share that information with potential recruits? Of course not. You maintain secrecy and thereby protect and bolster your own position in the dynamic if any negotiations.  
  
It may well be that many people are quite happy to share their current package with you. It's also completely irrelevant to as ascertaining whether it is actually a good idea or not. Many people all over the world do things that act counter to their best interests every single day but just because they do just not mean that I should. If they wish to shoot themselves in both feet then that is their choice.  
  
Finally, I and many others consider it a spectacular red flag when recruiters and employers are not prepared to be up-front with prospective employees as to what they would be expecting to offer for a role in terms of salary and benefits (or per hour/per day rates for contract positions). If that information is not in an advert on a website then it is not unreasonable to suspect that an employer does not want current employees to know what they are prepared to offer for roles and it's a good bet that there are significant morale issues and conflicts between employees and management within that company.

Having recalculated everyone's GDP, they shouldn't have embarked on a levelling exercise. They should've said ""Here are the new figures, and we will use these henceforth.""

Yes, some people in the UK would have thrown a small tantrum at that, because it would call on us to pay more anyway, but your contribution going up *next time* because of a recalculation is far easier to swallow than ""We've recalculated after you already paid and have decided you didn't pay enough.

&gt;___Äkta människor___ ([English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) title: ___Real Humans___) is a 2012 [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_television) [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction)/[drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama) series set in an alternate near-future version of Sweden where consumer-level humanoid [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot) workers and servants are widespread. The series follows the resulting emotional effects on two families as well as the trials of a group of robots who have attained free will and want their freedom from human ownership.

&gt;It premiered on [SVT 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVT1) on 22 January 2012. The series was written by Lars Lundström and directed by [Harald Hamrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Hamrell) and Levan Akin.  As of 2013, the series has been sold to about 50 countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and South Korea.  A second season of ten episodes premiered on SVT1 in October 2013. In April 2013 the ""Real Humans"" official Facebook page posted a message that Lars Lundström is currently writing the third series, but as of August 2014, SVT is yet to officially announce whether the series will be renewed for a third season.

false,Fineus,null,null,"&gt; That's nice. And anyone who listens to what you've said on this is doing themselves a disservice and placing themselves in a highly disadvantageous position given that there is a already a significant power imbalance in the relationship dynamics anyway. You are making it clear that you expect a prospective candidate to show their entire hand when you and the employer are not showing yours. 

You're making some serious assumptions / generalisations about the way that I work there. 

I make a point of finding out what my clients can pay - what they can *realistically* pay and any benefits and bonuses that are included. Why wouldn't I? I gain absolutely nothing by wasting anyone's time with salaries and packages that are not going to be appropriate. 

If the client protests disclosing this (and I rarely see it happen - but perhaps others have had worse experiences and should educate their clients) then I'll happily explain to them why they need to give me all the details to save us all a headache. 

&gt;  It simply is not in any prospective employee's best interests to disclose their current package and it is not something that you as a recruiter or any prospective employer needs to know. 

Fine, if you want to go through an entire hiring process only to turn a job down because you neglected to disclose some vital information that means we could have managed the process on your behalf better. 

&gt; By telling you what I am currently receiving then both you and the employer will adjust any potential offer you may make accordingly and the reality is that it is pretty much guaranteed that any adjustment in offer that is a made will be in a downward direction from what you would have been prepared to offer as your starting position. 

Feel free to explain that to the Business Analyst I just found an extra £5,000 on top of his asking salary for this morning. 

&gt; This is especially important as I do not know what relationship you as a recruiter have with a company and how you would be expected to be compensated by them and as such what may be motivating and incentivising you in the decisions you make. Do you share that information with potential recruits? Of course not. 

Wrong. Let me explain how I get compensated - you'll soon see it's in my best interests to get you as much money as possible: 

If it's a contract we take a fixed fee for our services that's pre-agreed with the client. The rest goes to you as the day rate and that is what we advertise. I don't think that needs further explanation... 

If it's a permanent job then we take a finders fee which - and this is the good bit - is a percentage of the basic salary that you are offered to work at a company. This percentage is agreed in T&amp;Cs beforehand with the company and does not change. The higher the basic salary we get you - the higher our finders fee. 

*This fee is paid out of a separate fund for recruitment from that company - and not from the basic salary from that company that you go on to get paid annually).*

In other words we never ever ever take from *you* as a job seeker. Our services are free to you. We don't take from your contract rate and we don't take from your basic salary. 

&gt;  If they wish to shoot themselves in both feet then that is their choice. 

Well as I've just illustrated that's not the case - in fact making a point of *not* disclosing it is more liable to shoot yourself in the foot as everyone involved will start to wonder when you plan to spring the surprise that you want more money on us. 

&gt; Finally, I and many others consider it a spectacular red flag when recruiters and employers are not prepared to be up-front with prospective employees as to what they would be expecting to offer for a role in terms of salary and benefits (or per hour/per day rates for contract positions). 

Fine by me, I include it in the first email I send with the full job specifications and the company websites. You want more information? Ask me. I appreciate some do not work this way - but then as we're seeing with yourself, some candidates don't work at their best either. 

In closing I do appreciate that some companies and recruitment agencies act without integrity. But they are made up of people. Candidates - also - are people and therefore equally prone to act without integrity. I've taken some time to explain how *I* work here because I hope to dis-spell some of the assumptions about recruiters - but by being guarded and cagey, you will also be creating a doubt in the minds of those you work with.

I studied at the university of birmingham in the past, and am hoping to do so again in the future as it's a lovely uni &amp; city. I'll skip the uni-subreddit question as it's been answered.

1.) I stayed by five ways, at QHC liberty living - which was fun, one train stop from uni. ensuite halls with 6 rooms to one flat, with personal showers and loos. you'll probably want to either stay in one of the private halls or then apply for vale/mason/tennis courts, which are just up the road from uni. 

There's some light banter between halls but nothing to take too seriously.

2.) depends on what you're into! digbeth/moseley/kings heath has a lot of 'underground' clubs such as PST, the rainbow, the ORT &amp; the harenhounds, where lots of gigs are held. loads of people go to broad street with it's giant mainstream clubs, but that isn't necessarily for everyone. birmingham has enough to cater to most all subcultures, especially metal &amp; reggae.

3.) definitely join a society, whatever interests you, and be outgoing - people there are too trying to make friends! they will have their own events and bar crawls which is a great way to meet people.

4.) I visited some mates i had nearby, and occasionally trained it up to leeds for gigs - it's all about who you know! in terms of nature, there's the lickey hills to the south of birmingham and a beautiful massive park in sutton coldfield to the north, and a few more cultural/historical towns in warwickshire nearby where you can take your parents if they visit.

Birmingham is a truly magical city if you can cut yourself a slice that tends just to who you are. Do enjoy your semester in brum!

On the ball he is pretty damn poor, he has a decent level of ability, but seemingly struggles to put any of it together, and ends up making horrible mistakes. 

His tenacity, ability to read gameflow and defensive intelligence are years beyond his age- and that is usually the toughest part that a defensive midfielder can learn.  Yes, McCarthy is a few years ahead of him in terms of putting it all together, but he has had a long time playing top flight football- which Besic has not. 

The way Besic has been able to shut down both Messi and Bale for Bosnia is a testament to his skill, and I feel against certain type of opposition (like ones with world class forwards)- even with his faults he can make a real difference for us, and over the next year or two he will be able to hammer out his faults and become an all round good player. 

The reason people love him though is that he is *such* an Everton player of old. He is aggressive, tough and direct with his tackling. He is so similar to Howard Kendall in a lot of respects, and with the rhetoric around Everton with Martinez wanting to look to our past to find our future (School of Science has been mentioned many a time), and the look towards a more 'total football' style, there is thought that Jimmy, Ross and Mo could be the new 'Holy Trinity' in the middle of the park.

If you send a letter, it takes a few weeks, I can't recall my exact timeframes but I'm pretty certain it was under 2 months, *possibly* under 1. You get a cheque in the post.

All you need to do is tell them how much your gross contributions (*after* the first 20% has been added on! This is very important!) were in each year, and give them your NI number.

Most renting is done on AST agreements, usually on a 6 month term. This means a tenant can be legally evicted at the end of a tenancy term as long as they are given 2 months notice.

However, there is already an alternative, which has been in law since 1989: ""Assured tenancies"". These agreements offer protection against eviction. In fact, the landlord basically cannot evict a tenant without agreement. Rent can be re-negotiated once per year and can be submitted for review if agreement can't be reached. 

So why aren't these types of tenancy used more often? Mortgage rules mean that a house let under a Assured Tenancy is unmortgagable and thus near worthless. There are downsides for a tenant too though, for one thing they are obligated to maintain the residence much more than on an AST.

He founded TalkSport, so why isn't there outrage when Liverpool legends go on air? He's got a highly renumerated Daily Mail column, so why does The Sun (which doesn't pay the cunt anything) get boycotted while Carra works for The Mail, which is one of the most read papers on Merseyside? He frequently gets paid to go on Question Time and HIGNFY, but I don't see people in Liverpool spitting at the very mention of those programmes.

The Sun is an odious paper, but MacKenzie was an autocrat who insisted on 'The Truth' as a front page headline despite the reservations of everyone else there. The anger needs to be concentrated on him and him alone. Refusing to buy The Sun because of Hillsborough is either a decision made as the result of a lack of awareness of why 'The Truth' was the headline, or a cop out.

Later France designed the EU's CAP (common agricultural policy) to mostly benefit French farmers and the French countryside, at some points over 60% of CAP money from every other European country was going to France, the level of butthurt is astronomical in France that they now have to share the CAP with other European countries, especially Poland.

He founded TalkSport, so why isn't there outrage when Liverpool legends go on air?

The Sun is an odious paper, but MacKenzie was an autocrat who insisted on 'The Truth' as a front page headline despite the reservations of everyone else there.

Refusing to buy The Sun because of Hillsborough is either a decision made as the result of a lack of awareness of why 'The Truth' was the headline, or a cop out.

Just as an example I always used, there's Lamela vs Villa on YouTube (where he should have picked up a goal and 2 assists on a different day, even last season) and at one stage (about 35 secs in) he picks up the ball from the air, stops it dead, and shrugs of Sylla who is a typical mountain of a DM and off he goes through the center and plays a nice little ball. 

I really think he has that same raw ability as Bale to step it up a notch (who lets not forget, was about to be sold for peanuts to Birmingham at one stage) and just PLOW through people. He has the tools like Bale did - it's just that belief, confidence &amp; hunger which I think he's gaining (Bale once he started copying Ronaldos hair and clothes). You can see it how he presses - I lost count now of the amount of times I've seen him win the ball back by pressing more than anyone in our First 11. He just needs that ''I can do what the fuck I want'' like he did with his Rabona attitude to go with it.

The scary thing is he is much more technical and creative than Bale, imo. He is up there with Eriksen at spotting a pass. Once he has that belief, he's gonna be scary as hell and I honestly am gonna jinx this but I would NOT be surprised if you start seeing ''Lamela to Madrid'' bullshit starting sooner rather than later and /r/soccer &amp; the media doing the whole ''he needs to leave....further his career'' routine after doing nothing but slating him for an entire season.

&gt;It is hard to find any economist who supports rent restraints. Price controls, even if laboriously tweaked, inevitably produce inefficiencies, reduce supply and cause bad side-effects. Black markets and bribery thrive. Building maintenance is often ignored. Landlords and tenants find themselves in poisonous relationships, since they are linked by law rather than by voluntarily renewable contracts. Unscrupulous property owners go to dangerous lengths to evict tenants in order to get higher-paying replacements; as a result, tenant-protection laws have been enacted that make it almost impossible to evict even a scoundrel.

&gt;Meanwhile, a vast bureaucracy has grown up to administer the price controls, supported by volunteers and litigators. The property owner who misses a filing deadline, or has his paperwork mislaid, can be blocked from even permissible rent increases. Given all this, most sane New Yorkers would rather eat their money than join the rentier class.

We just have to reform planning permission and encourage people to build on or sell unproductive land via a land value tax.

false,lydz1985,null,null,"I'm going to throw my ideas in here as an ex-recruiter, now nurse.

The market I specifically worked within, was extremely incestuous. Usually, the hiring company would already have someone working for them that knew the ins and outs of the company I was sending my candidate from, usually because they had worked there. This meant they knew how that company paid.

Now, as Fineus has stated, it was always in my best interest to get the candidate the best package for a number of reasons, but mainly because I wanted the candidate to be happy and say yes, and because I honestly wanted a better bonus.

So, here comes the important bit and why I need 100% transparency, if my candidate is on £30,000 and I send them for a position they 90% suit paying £40,000, I need to justify with the candidate, and the company, why they are worth an extra £10,000. It could be the case that the company doesn't know and never asks about the original salary, but what if they do know what company X pays? I need to give solid justifications why my candidate is worth the extra, my candidate also needs to justify the same in interview.

Honesty, is always the best policy.

My advice for OP, you have already told them your salary, your job now is to show them why you are worth more. There is no shame in working for less than your market worth, you gained brilliant experience, you just need to let that show.

If the company you have interviewed for are really having an issue with such a big jump, why not meet them half way? If you are going through an agency, this probably won't work, but if you applied yourself it might.

Ask them about the probationary period, if you are 100% positive about your skills, ask them to input some very clearly defined targets within the probationary period, on the basis that you start at a slightly lower salary than advertised, if they are happy with you and you hit the agreed targets, your salary is then increased to that advertised. I have done this before personally and my salary was increased well before the probationary period was up.

The best result however, would be that you have simply let your skills show within interview and salary increase isn't an issue for them.",0,1414154434,null,0,false,0,clifyqq,t3_2k3o2h,t1_clifyqq,t1_clif7tv,null,1426373683,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

The difference here would be that it seems staggeringly unlikely that Asda hired men for warehouse jobs and women for checkout jobs.

Another similar case is Birmingham council, but the mistake they made was paying bonuses to certain jobs but not others which was wrong.

Fundamentally this Asda case seems to be based on someone noticing that there's more women than men in some positions and vice versa, and that there's a difference in pay.

Going back to my first post, consider it ""realpolitik"": you've got a part of your club that contributes 10% of your yearly budget planning an in-out referendum in 3 years and who have a vocal, popular and growing anti-EU movement that swept the EU election, has won a by-election and are tipped to win more seats. You're now telling this club ""because you're doing comparatively better than most of us, we're taking more money from you"".

The actual money you're taking is insignificant, both to you and to that part of the club, but the political message is potent. We're doing a lot better than average (to the tune of 20% apparently), and you're taking money off of us for that.

This *will* translate into UKIP support. This *will* reinforce UKIP's anti-EU message. This *will* embolden a party that are already popular on the ground and who are attacking two established parties that are both in bad positions even without UKIP (Labour is losing Scotland to the SNP and the Tories are having a little civil war over pro- and anti-Europe).

Following realpolitik, this is a plainly bad move. ""Realpolitik for Dummies"" could list this decision on page 1 as ""What Realpolitik is not"".

Every single thing you have said requires only that you know what my expectations are. Note that I have never at any point said that a person should not indicate what there expectations are, simply that they should not disclose what they currently receive. 

I've given you plenty of explanation *and examples* and if that's not enough - so has /u/lydz1985 . 

It's clear you're set in your ways, it seems there's not a whole lot more anyone can say to explain this to you and so best of luck to you in future endeavours. 

The *danger* is you giving bad or incomplete or - in all likelihood - jaded advice to other job seekers. 

&gt; You may well be a good and decent recruiter who acts in a highly altruistic fashion and provide services only for those employers who want to gift their employees with puppies and unicorns. However, there are many who are not and I do not know which you are going into a negotiation.

Then take some time to find out. Use your head. A phone call works both ways - it's not just for me to pull as much information out of you as possible - you'll want information from me as well. 

If I'm forthcoming with that information and answer all your questions - I hope you'll know I'm interested in doing a good job for you and for my client. 

If I seem cagey and reluctant to give you concrete details or talk at length about the role - you'll no doubt pick up on that and realise you should be vigilant of whether I have your best interests at heart.

You have to be careful with this though. Villages like the one I live in do not need more development - they've had their fair share over the last few years, without any infrastructure investment to match. The roads are congested, the school is full (with no room to expand because a developer was allowed to build around it), the sewers overflow when it rains. The developers don't have to pay a penny towards fixing this.

The council wants to keep building, the developers want cheap land and planning permission but without sacrificing any profits to improve the village, the parish council wants to tell them both to piss off. Local opinion seems to be to side with the parish council. There are plenty of other places to build.

With one of the more recent developments near me there was something extremely fishy about the planning process - officially some of the houses were deemed ""affordable housing"" and a previously denied application got waved through, but it honestly wouldn't be surprising if there were some brown envelopes going around.

The only thing I can credit the council for is that they are genuinely trying to build a new 'eco town' and are building some road bypasses in the area to alleviate congestion.

His views still have some influence, but compared to modern public law jurisprudence, they're very outdated.  Besides, an ad homonem is completely acceptable in this context; you cited Dicey as an authority based on his qualifications (Vinerian professor, ""seminal scholar"" etc), critiquing his qualifications, including the most vital (heh) one is therefore relevant.

My comment about it being a no brainer was not a claim that it was law, rather my opinion on the matter. I believe legally speaking it is *could* happen, and for other reasons (including some relating to legal questions) it *should* happen.

The question of whether it is permissible to alter the power of parliament by changing the manner and form by which it makes law is integral to the question of whether it is possible for parliament to bind itself. This is something that has been fairly well answered in the academic legal community (there's an overview in O’Hood, Phillips and Jackson *Constitutional and Administrative Law* which is authoritative, I think Halsbury's is also of this opinion). Jackson is an example of the HL/UKSC recognising this principle. That answer, although it has never really been tested, is probably yes. It would additionally require something extra, from which it derived legitimacy such as a referendum.

Of course, this goes against the traditional narrative of parliamentary sovereignty, but british constitutional law is an exceedingly murky field in which what is commonly accepted as the law, is in fact, the law. The conventional jurisprudential source of law, is that it is recognised as the law, this allows convention to shape the law, and how it is made. The very notion of parliamentary sovereignty is founded on, and gains legitimacy from, nothing more than public recognition of it.

The atmosphere was brilliant and it was great to see a proper European night back at Anfield after so long. There's no other ground like it for that, and even though the result was terrible it was kind of cathartic to see it return. In that sense, the sentiment of ""European royalty"" and 5 times was very much appreciated. 

What annoyed me was unrealistic confidence that we could stop Real, who are probably the best team on earth right now, simply because it was a European night at Anfield and we beat them 5 years ago. I don't mean this to say that it's wrong to have hoped for a shock win or even a draw, but the gulf between Liverpool and Real was alarming. 

I think it was a manifestation of a lot of things that are sometimes dodgy about Liverpool in a larger sense. We're Liverpool, so we don't buy superstars, we build them. Ok, but where does that leave us against the big hitters? Our atmosphere will carry the boys through. Ok, but is that really going to stop the likes of Ronaldo, or the Chelsea gang who have long since swapped honour for money? The respect and reverence for the club's historic way of doing things is subjectively admirable, but is it objectively the right way forward for LFC in this era?

5 years is eons in football now. 5 years ago Manchester City were just emerging from the Championship, Real were in disarray, Bayern were relatively struggling and PSG had yet to arrive on the scene. The game has changed and we need to change with it. Losing a world class player and expecting that replacing him with a cadre of decent players and would work was foolish.

If Sturridge wasn't so injury prone, and hopefully he kicks the injuries but he has the potential to be our talisman. Yes we lost a world class player but if we went and spent all our money on another striker, which the selling team would have fleeced us for, we would be in a worse crisis regarding squad dept. 

All last season it was noted that we used the same 15 or so players and with getting back into the champions league, we couldn't afford to go and buy one or two world class players and hope we don't get injuries. We had no full backs, little midfield to rely on and a strike force of Sterling, Suarez and Sturridge. We needed to replace 30 plus goals and we tried with a large amount of attackers but also increased dept in other areas. People seem to forget about the lack of dept we had and how that was urgent to address. 

This season with Suarez gone, it was never about challenging for the title or winning CL, but to consolidate CL places. At the moment we are on for that with other teams also playing terrible. Get  out of the group? Great! More money to spend and higher UEFA coeff which means if we qualify again we might go up a pot.

false,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; I wonder how Germany solves this issue?

In Germany there are strict rules that strongly favor the tenant. Firstly, tenants can only be evicted for four things;

* Breach of contract (i.e. having pets when you agreed no pets)
* Missing 2 months of rent (however the eviction process for this is very slow by comparison to the UK, and usually takes up to 6 months)
* Subletting the property without the landlords consent
* Damage to the properties interior

In response most leases in Germany are long by UK standards, and its normal for a German landlord to expect an initial lease of 2 years. The other downside is the deposit tends to be proportionally higher (usually up to 3 months rent). 

In addition, most cities operate a form of rental control in which a landlord can only list the property at +/- 50% of the mean ""average"" local price. Ontop of this they can only raise the price by a maximum of 20% in any 3 year period. This has helped to smooth out increases in price over the last 4 years of the recession whereas in the UK they have ballooned. 

Perhaps the biggest differences are the landlords themselves... In the UK we have a mostly rag-tag market made up of amateurs that only got into the industry in the last 15 years through Buy-To-Let. In Germany they have a professionalized sector where landlords are often corporations, renting dozens or even hundreds of properties with their own dedicated maintenance contractors or staff. These companies are keen to maintain their image and being larger in size they have to act more scrupulously than their UK counterparts - who as one-man-bands can often get away with significant abuses and still stay under the radar. 

Finally there are tax incentives for landlords to claim back tax by investing profits into their properties to maintain them. It actively encourages landlords to keep properties in a good state of repair, since the state subsidizes it.",0,1414158097,null,0,false,0,clihb4s,t3_2k6efn,t1_clihb4s,t1_cliez2u,null,1426373056,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"The type of pension that your employer offer dictates what will happen when you leave the company. For the average employee with a normal employer scheme their pension will become *frozen* when they leave the employer, this means that no contributions are permitted but the investments within that pension will continue to grow. The pension will be frozen until retirement age at which point it can be taken as with any other pension, or depending on the scheme it may be possible during your working life to transfer the pension value to a new employers scheme -- or indeed your own.

The reason you should *always*[1] contribute to a matched employer pension is because of the returns it provides relative to taking the money after tax. If you contribute up to your employers match you get an instant 100% return on your money, your hypothetical £500 becomes £1000 in your pension immediately. This is a very valuable benefit, and choosing not to take advantage of the available match is choosing not to have all the money your employer has allocated to you.

Even if you never return to the UK the pension is still yours and you can still access it in retirement. Another important factor to consider when opting out of a pension is that plans frequently change, you might never leave the country, you might fall in love and move back here a year later when your girlfriend is pregnant, you might have to return to support your parents... so many things can happen that can change plans and having money locked away just in case your life doesn't work out as you expected can be helpful when it comes to retirement. A lot of people say ""I won't contribute to my pension this year because... I'll start next year"" and then they say the same next year, and the year after, and before they know it they're 35 with 10 years of missed free contributions from their employer and far behind where they need to be.

[1] There are exceptions to every rule, however you should always approach pensions (with a contribution match) as something you *should* contribute to *unless* you have a reason not to.

More (and better paid) nurses and practitioners. Better training and pay for biomedical scientists, fewer contract staff, have the cleaning, admin and suchlike all publicly owned rather than farmed out to serco and sodexo. Stop stupid outsourcing schemes and ensure that the NHS is properly focussed on patient care, not boxticking.

Wait, wasn't that how it used to be pre-1980s?

I don't think a two-tier system would work, I appreciate the sentiment but as soon as you start paying tax or NI contributions you should be fully entitled to NHS care. If you are an EU immigrant then the EHIC should cover medical costs to an extent as well until such timer as you are making NI / tax contributions. Any denial of healthcare due to social or ethnic status goes completely against the tenets of the NHS. As /u/HuhDude rightly points out it is a

&gt;national scale project, funded by the collective, in order to support those in ill-health no matter their circumstances

and should be treated as such.

Admittedly there are some area that need a huge rethink: I'm not convinced that IVF or other fertility treatments should be available on the NHS, nor non-essential cosmetic surgery without psychological evaluation, just to name a couple of examples.

It is well worth noting that for all our gripes and complaints about the NHS it is still envied by many other nations.

The power of parliament was not altered. How it used it power was. Parliament is still unbound as long as it can return power to the lords. The parliament acts did not curtail the power of parliament, only that of one house, the King in parliament is still as one body supreme, it is simply a rebalancing.

false,rev9of8,null,null,"&gt; I've given you plenty of explanation and examples and if that's not enough - so has /u/lydz1985 . 

&gt; It's clear you're set in your ways, it seems there's not a whole lot more anyone can say to explain this to you and so best of luck to you in future endeavours.  
  
And I have taken the time to explain the issues and problems with what you are saying. It is quite clear that you are not prepared to take those on board.   
  
Consider the example you gave of the Business Analyst who you got £5k more than his salary expectation - at no point did you give any explanation of how knowing his current salary aided in that, instead you simply asserted it as an example of where it did. Yet in that example you yourself indicated that what you got him was not predicated upon his current salary but upon his salary expectations.  
  
&gt; The danger is you giving bad or incomplete or - in all likelihood - jaded advice to other job seekers.  
  
And the true danger is actually in someone failing to recognise the possibilty both of your self-interest and that you are in position from which you cannot objectively assess matters owing to issues of partiality.  
  

Consider, by way of analogy, if someone were posting here asking to what to do because they were considered they might be arrested for something even though you know you have done nothing wrong. You are comparable to a police officer posting in response that you should be completely honest and open with the officers interviewing you under caution and offer up any information you think might be helpful so that they can eliminate you from their enquiries.  
  
I am quite prepared to accept that you are one of the good guys and that you genuinely do have your clients best interests at heart. There are many recruiters who are like that. Unfortunately there are many who are not. I have dealt with both as well as employers good and bad. However, When we make that initial contact I do not know which you are and can only build up an impression of that based upon our interactions in order to allow me to make a decision that I will be happy with.  
  
&gt; Then take some time to find out. Use your head. A phone call works both ways - it's not just for me to pull as much information out of you as possible - you'll want information from me as well. 
  
I may have to go back and re-read what I have said but I do not immediately recall claiming anything to the contrary. For example, I indicated that going into a negotiation I do not know whether you or anyone else is one of the good guys. That is an impression that can only be built up over the course of our discussions and every part of our interaction from the very first contact is a negotiation. 

However, you seem intent on having an argument with me about points that are at best adjuncts to the issue that was initially raised. That initial issue was whether it was a good idea to give your current salary information and gaming all the scenarios makes it quite clear that it is not ultimately in an individuals self-interest and is a major tactical and strategic error.  
  
Consider: if we make contact about a role and it gets to the point where we are discussing salary expectations for the role then is it not reasonable that, barring any circumstance that might necessitate me seeking to depart my current employer as quickly as possible, any salary expectation and package I indicate would be of interest to me would be greater than my current recompense?   
  
What rational reason would I have for indicating a salary expectation that is lower than that which I am currently in receipt of?   
  
Therefore you can reasonably infer that what I am currently receiving is less than that which I am asking for so in what way would it benefit me to tell you what I am currently receiving? It is information that only serves to diminish my standing in any negotiation where there is a significant power imbalance.
  
It may well be the case that in the recruitment field there is an expectation that that information be provided but that does not mean it is a actually a good idea to do so.
  
&gt;If I seem cagey and reluctant to give you concrete details or talk at length about the role - you'll no doubt pick up on that and realise you should be vigilant of whether I have your best interests at heart. 

&gt;At the end of the day there's one overriding fact: You will not accept a job that you do not want to accept, nor attend interviews you do not want to attend. You have that power entirely. Therefore it's in my interests to do the best job for you and it's in your interests to make sure you have all you need to make informed decisions.
  
And I am not disputing that but it fundamentally does not address the point that it is not actually in someone's best interests to provide current salary information.  
  
&gt; But implying I've presented no coherent explanation and continuing to act with suspicion?   
   
It is my view that you have not offered a coherent explanation as to why it is ultimately in an individuals best interests to ever give their current salary information when everything you do in your role can be done on the basis of what an individual's salary expectations are.  
  
As to acting with a certain degree of suspicion, of course I do. Unless you are claiming to be Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and I do not think you are claiming such, then you are ultimately going to be acting in your own self-interest. Hopefully, both mine and your self-interest coincide in such a way that you will consider your self-interest to be served by promoting my self-interest resulting in a mutually beneficial and productive relationship. However, as we both know there are bad employers and plenty of fly-by-night cowboys in the recruitment sector whose behaviour and conduct is reprehensible. Whilst I would hope to identify which you are and which you represent during our discussions, it would be foolhardy indeed to go into such negotiations assuming that you are one of the good guys.
  
Unfortunately, that is not always the case and many people do not behave in such a manner. To act on the basis that that is not so would be to act as if we live in a Disneyfied re-imaging of a fairytale.
  
&gt;That seems like a problem at your end I'm afraid, not mine. I'm not obliged to take time out of my day to address your concerns but I have, it's up to you if you'll learn from that.  
  
And maybe you should try learning from me. Whilst I have never worked in the recruitment sector I have worked alongside such as those who in a past live have run their own recruitment companies with whom I have had extensive discussions about these matters. I have also had plenty of interactions with recruiters of many different types and attitude which has allowed me to build up at least a modest impression of them. Further, I have been in the position of being involved in and privy to very confidential information relating to issues surrounding recruitment and such as things as compensation offers to prospective employees. I do not speak from a position of complete ignorance.

I don't agree with the boycott because in my opinion that does a lot of tarring with a broad brush and doesn't focus enough on Kelvin MacKenzie, who is actually responsible, and allows him to escape too much of the flack.

The paper that paid him for years to distort the truth, victimise people, spy, lie and more are as responsible. They provided the toxic environment that piece of shit required in order to thrive.

&gt;He founded TalkSport, so why isn't there outrage when Liverpool legends go on air? 

Not quite. He and his team of arseholes purchased a succesful(ish) property and rebranded it. It gets my goat when Liverpool people go on there and I'd agree that there *should* be as much backlash. The reason there isn't is probably down to people not knowing though, owing to him being a background figure.

&gt;He's got a highly renumerated Daily Mail column, so why does The Sun (which doesn't pay the cunt anything) get boycotted while Carra works for The Mail, which is one of the most read papers on Merseyside?

The Daily Mail *does* get boycotted by plenty of people - me included. I've passed up the opportunity to work for them myself! When Kenny, and later Carra, signed up to work for them they were pushed on it plenty! Unfortunately, given their status, they were able to walk past it.

You have to remeber here though, that The Sun wasn't just hated for Hillsborough. It was a pro-Thatcher paper which had, for years, demonised the people of the north. The Hillsborough smear was the final straw.

The Daily Mail hasn't got itself into that position...yet.

&gt;He frequently gets paid to go on Question Time and HIGNFY, but I don't see people in Liverpool spitting at the very mention of those programmes.

I dunno where you're based or on what social media you spend your time (if any) but there's always outrage when McKenzie's on there! The BBC get inundated with emails, tweets and the like, taking them to task for it!

&gt;The Sun is an odious paper, but MacKenzie was an autocrat who insisted on 'The Truth' as a front page headline despite the reservations of everyone else there. 

Saying everyone else there expressed reservations is a tenuous and sweeping defence of a publication which expressed no morals in all of its years in print, and part of the reason I called you on your 'us' comment. They attacked ordinary people for years, printed their innermost secrets and ordeals, drove them to suicide in some cases, why would any of them care about the demonisation of Liverpool fans who were already considered fair game after their European ban?

&gt;The anger needs to be concentrated on him and him alone.

No. It doesn't. You need to do some reading and learn a little about that paper's relationship with people in the North West *and* North East.

&gt;Refusing to buy The Sun because of Hillsborough is either a decision made as the result of a lack of awareness of why 'The Truth' was the headline, or a cop out.

Nonsense - and offensive nonsense at that. Pouring scorn on people reacting to a tragedy when you patently don't understand the historical context or the social issues behind much of their antipathy isn't on. 

&gt;Boycotting a paper that you wouldn't read anyway and failing to boycott the things that pay MacKenzie but you do consume, thats not ok in my book.

Well that just shows why 'your book' is in no way connected with the majority of the people of Liverpool or, I'd bet, 99.9% of people who call themselves Liverpool supporters.

I found when we had a few rainy nights and the damp on the bike chilled the engine components, she would take between 1-2 seconds to turn over and even then, the smell from the automatic choke wasn't pleasant - it was definitely compensating for being a cold start. This obviously requires more juice from the battery as well, so the cold and the (relatively) small battery combined made it difficult.

I got me a [rather expensive bike cover](http://www.amazon.co.uk/OXFORD-STORMEX-MOTORCYCLE-WEATHER-COVER/dp/B000R593AG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414159693&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=stormex) online to help insulate and protect the bike from the elements as it got further into winter. I didn't want her rusting or getting wet - I'm quite keen to keep the YBR - so it seemed a good investment. Unless it's a silly cold night, the bike now starts on the button every time in that same fraction of a second that was in the summer. It also protects the various parts against the elements which I would always recommend.

So that helps for sure. ~~Get a cheaper cover if you don't want to fork out the £££ for the StormEx~~, but a lined/insulated cover definitely helps in the early mornings.

Going back to the battery needing extra oomph to cold start, riding 15 minutes isn't really enough to boost that battery charge. You need to get the revs nice and high and warm that engine up. You will put more energy back into the battery that way and I think that combined with a cover will sort you out. Certainly did for me. If you're daily commute is always going to be 15 minutes then take the bike out later in the day when it's not so cold and give it a run up a ring road or something, get those pistons working.

The extra hastle of putting an insulated cover on every night/taking it off every morning is definitely worth it. 

Protip - the StormEx (if you are tempted) is one hefty bugger of fabric, so be careful when pulling it over number plates, wingmirrors, indicators etc!

**Edit**: Just realized you already have a cover and you live in Cardiff. I use my cover all the time, even if the bike is already wet. It keeps it drier than if you wouldn't and leaving rainwater on the bike overnight to chill the components is not good, especially on such a small machine.

false,Fineus,null,null,"&gt; And I have taken the time to explain the issues and problems with what you are saying. It is quite clear that you are not prepared to take those on board. 

Actually I have moderated what I've said with the admission that there are bad an unscrupulous recruiters and companies out there. 

&gt; Consider the example you gave of the Business Analyst who you got £5k more than his salary expectation - at no point did you give any explanation of how knowing his current salary aided in that, instead you simply asserted it as an example of where it did. 

Fair enough. He was also expecting a pay rise at the end of the year and had a number of financial bonuses in his role that - if we hadn't asked or been told about them - would not explain his needs fully. 

&gt; However, you seem intent on having an argument with me about points that are at best adjuncts to the issue that was initially raised. That initial issue was whether it was a good idea to give your current salary information and gaming all the scenarios makes it quite clear that it is not ultimately in an individuals self-interest and is a major tactical and strategic error. 

I've gone to lengths to explain why the industry works the way it does and why we need to know. I've also shown how it's not a major tactical or strategic error. Again you seem intent on seeing us recruiters and the job seeking industry as a whole as 'enemies' for lack of a better word. I've already shown several times over the reasons that it's *not* detrimental to your job seeking efforts to be honest and provide thorough information when asked of it. 

&gt; Therefore you can reasonably infer that what I am currently receiving is less than that which I am asking for so in what way would it benefit me to tell you what I am currently receiving? It is information that only serves to diminish my standing in any negotiation where there is a significant power imbalance.

Again this 'power imbalance'. When you see everything as a fight, it will be one. I've already explained how the information is both relevant and helps us to best represent you. You may not agree with it personally - but that doesn't change anything I'm afraid. When I'm explaining to my client that you're unwilling to disclose your current salary when they ask me, and they say that it's quite strange - I'll be forced to agree and that will be that. 

&gt; I fully acknowledge that yours is an argument made from position of informed opinion and perspective. However, it is does not follow that you must be automatically be correct because of that. There always exists the possibility that you are wrong, and not just wrong but very badly so.

The possibility is there - but ultimately it won't be affecting *me* negatively. 

By that I mean that I'm fully aware of my own abilities and that my method of working has proven successful for some time now. You're asking me to believe in something that I don't need to believe in. The battle is in your head, not here with me. 

So if that's the case then perhaps it's down to you as a job seeker to be vigilant of bad recruiters and forthcoming with the rest (which is the best case scenario). You're free not to do this and it doesn't look like you've any intention of changing. 

But for the benefit of the rest I can only tell them how it will look if they stick their feet in the ground as you have and refuse to discuss it. It looks strange and raises alarms with both recruiters and hirers. If they're OK with that they they're free to play games and be cagey with their information. *I* have little time for it and will find myself focussing my efforts on those who are forthcoming with me.

false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,"You didn't actually answer my question. We have a similar scheme in the UK too - an ""Assured Tenancy"", as opposed to the much more common ""Assured Shorthold Tenancy"". But nobody uses it primarily because a property rented under an Assured Tenancy instantly becomes unmortgageable for the length of that tenancy because if the landlord doesn't pay the mortgage and the bank go to re-possess, they cant evict the tenant so they can sell the property. Nobody can evict the tenant EVER unless they break the terms of the agreement. How does Germany solve this problem? Sounds like possibly they work on a hybrid between an AT and an AST, where basically people are on an AST-like agreement but on a much longer term than the UK-typical 6 months?

Otherwise, I think you might find that in fact renting in Germany vs the UK is more similar than you might think. Those four reasons a tenant can be evicted are pretty much the same as here. Eviction under any of the the four reasons listed is done under a ""Section 8"" of the Landlord and Tenant Act. It usually takes AT LEAST three months to push a Section 8 through. More if the tenant refuses to leave and you have to call in the bailiffs, or if there are ANY mitigating circumstances (Single Mum with a kid? forget it).

The only difference (imaybe?) is that in the UK on an AST agreement you can also evict under a ""Section 11"" notice, whereby you can evict the tenant with two months notice without giving any reason, but ONLY if the AST agreement has expired (and thus become a ""rolling AST""), or if the agreement is due to end within two months. So in practical terms: If you took a 2 year AST with a landlord in the UK, you would be safe from eviction for 1 year and 10 months, unless you broken the terms of the AST via one of the four methods you suggest.

As for your comments on 1-man bands vs big companies: It's very much give/take here as to which is preferable. Yes, you will often get a more professional service from a large company, but that service will come at increased cost due to the inefficiencies of a large company vs a 1-man band. I suspect the whole reason there aren't such companies in the UK is because they cant compete with smaller landlords who can live with lower rental income because they have much lower overheads.

The tax incentives are the same in the UK too.

Plus the reason why im kind of happy he had to sit out some was our team had to find their identity without him some, as individuals, the pressure was placed on them. Stevie obviously knows how to handle that responsibility but we have such a young squad that they are all accountable for the poor performances and when the good ones come back, they will be stronger mentally for it.

Salary expectations do not always match reality. I am going to give an overview of a situation that occurred in my career more times than I care to remember, and in every instance I hated having to have this conversation.

Again, I am going to state that I worked within the same sector for my whole recruitment career, other sectors may have a completely different result and therefore what rev9of8 says may be completely right in other circumstances.

I would often receive applications off people for experienced positions with a decent salary, I am talking about positions like electronics engineers paying salaries in the region of £60k plus. Now many of these applicants on paper had some experience in the field, but not enough for me to consider them at that salary, either way I would still contact them on the off chance their CV wasn't up-to-date.

More often than not, what I found was that these people had the same experience that their CV suggested and really did have an expectation of gaining the salary I was offering. This is where I honestly needed to know what salary they were currently on, in many situations, I discovered that this person had been at their current company so long, that they had completely surpassed the market rate for their role, and now they were fed up of company A, they were looking for positions which bettered or matched their current salary elsewhere. 

I needed to know their current salary to understand this, and have an honest conversation with that person about their situation. It's a shitty conversation to have, because I was generally telling them that they had two options. Stay in a company they hated on a very good salary, or move to a new company for much less money. 

The issue is, this conversation would never be able to happen had that person not been honest about their current salary, and the usual result would be that this candidate would be applying for hundreds of jobs based on salary and a slim fit, wondering why they had limited options and were getting no responses. 

Not every conversation I had was based around a perfect person for a perfect job, many conversations were spent giving people some serious advice. ",0,1414160812,null,0,false,0,cliiicz,t3_2k3o2h,t1_cliiicz,t1_clihxzo,null,1426372425,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

That's kind of what I see as the essence of case law. The law is constantly evolving, something written 90 years ago, especially in something like constitutional public law, can easily be outdated because the law changes. It's not an appeal against tradition so much as a recognition that the facts of the matter have changed.

Dicey's qualifications *do* support him though. His opinions have weight both because he was very knowledgeable about these issues, but also because decades of lawyers, academics, judges and politicians have believed him to be knowledgeable and based their understanding of the law on his writings. British common law is arrived at by consensus, via case law and convention, and authority shapes that consensus.

His belief that parliament cannot restrict the next parliament is outdated. Courts have recognised that parliaments may alter how the next may pass laws, as they did in Jackson. These manner and form restrictions can have a substantial impact on the validity of a supreme constitution. For example, parliament could pass an act requiring that any bill that would breach certain rights must have a certain process followed in passing that bill. 

A second avenue is something you already mention, courts have been increasingly willing to look towards certain sources of law as possessing some higher validity than other acts. There is, of course, the Thoburn case, but in NZ we also have a recognition of the primacy of the Constitution Act, NZBORA, and some underlying principles. Robin Cooke (later a member of the House of Lords and Privy Council) argued that some rights ran so deep that parliament could not abrogate them.

A woman from Barclays called me up a few months ago and asked about my activity. She was fairly stern and clearly suggested a couple of times that the activity of my account (receiving 20-30 payments a day, sending large payments to China or Slovenia) was suspicious and she had called for a better understanding. Once I told her exactly what I was doing, she said that it sounds fine to her and she'll put notes on my account and remove the 'flag' from it. I asked her if they have any policies against trading digital currencies and she said no, and as far as she knows, that have no plans to. I haven't heard anything since from them.

Really sucks for you that they've done this to you. Especially the fact they dated the letter the 20th October.. the same day they're closed your account. Perhaps you sold Bitcoins to someone who used a stolen bank account? Did you ever take precautions when selling? E.G. asking for photo ID that matched their bank account name?

One hour waiting on hold for Barclays.. sounds about right. I called them earlier this year to tell them I was going to Vegas, so DON'T BLOCK MY CARD. They blocked my card on the last day.

The condition of a Tory majority to secure a referendum in 2017, after a negotiation of fundamental terms which would require a treaty change when the UK only takes over presidency in summer 2017, terms which the commission has already said is not on the table, is a laughable timeframe.  If the EU needed reforming what's he been doing for the last 4 years?

As it is a referendum next term will happen either way.  It's the only way Labour or Conservatives can address the awkward questions UKIP are posing now that it is clear they're not going away.

Any party that 'wins' the general election (and we're almost certainly looking at a hung parliament if things continue as they are) will be destroyed in the next if this question still hasn't been addressed. 

The only alternative, other than actually meaningfully reforming the EU which there is next to no chance of, is to do what both Miliband and Cameron are doing now.  Attempting to appear tough on what they see UKIP issues and coming across as pale imitations - and it's creating its own internal problems within the two parties. 

So there will be a referendum regardless if the UKIP problem doesn't go away.  Only then can they campaign on staying in the EU and by winning it deem the UKIP concerns addressed.

false,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; You didn't actually answer my question. 

I did. The Germans don't need an assured tenancy equivalent because they have superseded different tenancy agreement models by simply legislating minimum standards. Therefore it doesn't matter what the structure of the contract is - because in effect all contracts are the equivalent of a beefed up UK assured tenancy. My understanding is that in the UK the only place you can usually find assured tenancies in any abundance is commercial property. 

&gt;  I think you might find that in fact renting in Germany vs the UK is more similar than you might think. 

I've actually done both.

&gt; Those four reasons a tenant can be evicted are pretty much the same as here. 

Perhaps I should have gone into more detail - in the UK those are the methods you can use to obtain a section 8 notice from a court. However, at the end of the contract term the landlord can simply opt to not renew. This is a huge issue, because often when tenants have issue with the property the landlord can simply ""wait them out"" for 6 months, then get new tenants in who either don't know about the issues or are less inclined to complain. Since councils often take &gt;6 months to enforce health and safety issues they too can simply be outlasted, and the result is a culture where tenants rarely complain about things like mould, broken doors or glass simply because it isn't worth the hassle or risk of a revenge-eviction. 

In Germany, doing those 4 things will also secure an eviction... however they are also the only reasons a landlord can opt out of renewing a contract. There is also a 5th point that the landlord can request the property back at the end of the tenancy term provided they can demonstrate they need it for their own use. But unlike the UK where they can simply say that, in Germany they have to actually provide physical proof - if the tenant can prove they were told to vacate a property so the landlord could take possession (to live in or to sell) and the landlord then fails to do that, they can take them to court to sue for unfair eviction! Can you imagine that in the UK?

&gt; I suspect the whole reason there aren't such companies in the UK is because they cant compete with smaller landlords

I disagree on this point. I think the main reason UK landlords tend to be one man bands is simply because the industry hasn't had time to cultivate here whereas in Germany the post-war trend has always been towards renting and indeed 60% of the population rent across all demographic groups... rather than the UK model where a much smaller (but rapidly growing) portion rent, and most are under 35. It means in Germany renting is higher up the political agenda and has had time to evolve more than the UK market. I'm in no doubt the same will happen in the UK for the very reason that lone-wolf Buy-to-Let landlords won't be able to compete with the kinds of discounts larger companies could provide. 

&gt; The tax incentives are the same in the UK too.

Big difference... in the UK buy-to-let tax avoidance is probably one of the most significant areas of domestic tax avoidance going. Landlords regularly fail to declare their properties appropriately. Again, this is an issue of a fledgling industry that still has a lot of room to develop in.

Context: 

I was arguing with a united fan and it got petty. I was banned for calling him stupid apparently. I accepted it wasn't the mature way to go about it and asked why if I qualified for a ban for that, when some guy pestering my private inbox and telling me to catch ebola on the actual sub itself didn't result in a ban a month prior. 

They took this as me ""using others an excuse for my behaviour to extend my ban"" [This coming from the mod /u/_sic who's banned people before for being someone he didn't like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1o5die/jordi_alba_gets_injued_again_while_recovering/ccp23u4)

The first 2 images are the messages from the mods. The 3rd is from some madrid fan whowas going on about the state of Liverpool fans etc when I replied with ""it's a shame we can't all start supporting the best team in the world after playing Fifa (which he'd admitted in a thread I'd seen before) after that he started messaging me all kinds of stuff like seen in the message.

Reported him to the mods and the reply is the 4th image I got.

However I still don't understand how a German company or individual is able to obtain a loan secured against a let property under such circumstances? In the UK, the Section 21 capability is fundamentally what allows BTL mortgages to exist. Without that, no bank would lend on a property that is being rented out as it cannot be repossessed and sold if the landlord doesn't pay his mortgage.

Services are the main (I, being fond of extremizing everything, would say 'only') driver of growth, responsible for .58 out of .7 points.

Within those, land transport and architectural and engineering activities take first place. At the same time, construction shows a modest increase year-on-year.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"One of the biggest reasons for the revised higher rate of growth is that income from illegal activities is now included in the calculation. 

Leaving aside whether or not it is right to include these figure, does anyone know whether other countries in the EU included this income in the past, or whether this is a new inclusion for ALL EU members? 

If this is a new inclusion for all member states, I find it hard to accept the argument that we were ""underpaying"" by not including it all these years. Is the implication that we should have been including it? Where does this implication come from? There does not seem to be any logical reason to include it, seeing as no tax revenue is raised by it. 

Even if this was the case, surely the fact that our contribution is evaluated every year is enough to figure out what we should be paying. Asking for 15 years of back payments based on changes made today still seems wrong. 

Also, it seems quite shady that an international body can look back at how different economies in the EU have grown over the last 15 years, and pick and choose how to calculate growth based on figure they already have in front of them. 

Surely you could use that power to increase and lower taxes to individual countries as you wished. If you want to squeeze more money out of certain economies, you can choose a factor to include in the calculation that will cause them to pay more, based on historic information.

The drug market in the UK is worth more than any other country in the EU, so whichever body chose to include it in the calculation would have know that it would impact the UK more than any other country.

false,LevitatingCheesecake,null,null,"You do make some good points, and I'll concede that perhaps I was a bit strong in my stance. 

I have never purchased a copy of The Sun, I have never read a copy of The Sun when it wasn't my job to do so, and I have absolutely no intention of changing my attitude towards them. It's a scummy, lowlife paper, responsible for ruining lives and is one of the crown jewels of a corrupt and toxic media empire. I don't dispute any of that, and where I can, I boycott the paper as a result. However, I don't boycott it as a result of Hillsborough, or at least, if I do, it's much smaller reason than it was 10 years ago.

There were two big factors in how The Sun covered Hillsborough. One was that the police, MPs and God-knows who else were drip-feeding the lies to the papers (remember, that it wasn't just The Sun who reported it), and the other was MacKenzie and a small team of cunts going too far.

The assumption for years was that The Sun made up those allegations. Regrettably, the Hillsborough documents have shown that the lies originated far higher up the food chain. I'm not defending MacKenzie or The Sun here, they were crass and insensitive for publishing them at face value, and certainly for publishing them in the incendiary manner that they did.

The Hillsbourough coverage was utterly unforgivable, but my view is that with the information available through the reports, the whole backlash needs to be targeted more precisely. I think too many people involved with that have got away with it, and targeting an entire news organisation doesn't help to change that. This is especially true when the paper in question doesn't have any staff left from the 80s.

NewsCorp took a hit in the wallet for the Hillsborough reporting, which is great, but the strength of feeling against The Sun could be better used IMO. I don't advocate buying The Sun, indeed, I'd encourage anyone not to, but I thing that the vitrol that goes in their direction is near-pointless 20 years on. The horse has bolted, and the stable has been knocked down. 

A few people tweeting about TalkSport, the programmes that he appears on and The Daily Mail isn't enough in my view, MacKenzie needs to be hounded out of the country for what he did. The club needs to ban the DM and anything that continues to employ him. Anything MacKenzie related needs to be boycotted, and I believe that the club needs to do more than ban the occasional Sun reporter from press conferences. To my knowledge, they are still unofficially allowed to matches. The club doesn't fucking care, and that's a disgrace. It could have an impact, I think banning the Mail from the club until MacKenzie is sacked would work, but they don't want to.

I'm not trying to defend The Sun here. I'm saying that the boycott isn't as useful as it was because MacKenzie and his team have left, and should be thus focussed on anyone who employs the cunt.

The fact that he's able to get a job in media shows that we're failing. He should be unemployable. Since he obviously isn't, there needs to be more pressure on the people that think he'd be useful. The Sun aren't going to take him back (they did so briefly in 2007, but he left soon afterwards). They're not going to take anyone associated with that headline back, if they're still alive. It's pointless focusing entirely on one paper.
 
One small point regarding how The Sun demonising the North-West and emphatically endorsing Thatcherism being a big factor in the boycott, as unpleasant as those things were, I don't think it was such a factor as The Sun was consistently one of the best selling papers on Merseyside.",0,1414165385,null,0,false,0,cliktc3,t3_2k3aug,t1_cliktc3,t1_clii0ph,null,1426371350,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

This would be with Ross being tucked in to allow a change with Naisy when necessary and also Bainesy bombing down the wing. Kev more on the outside to link up with Seamie. 

Can't help but think that Kev and Ross should be switched so Kev can cut in. He does it pretty much every time but also works mostly all the time as well. It's either Barkley or Kev whipping in crosses, which I am definitely okay with.

You might not, but the Equality Act 2010 does. The way the BBC are reporting this is in line with how the law sees the situation.

The premise is that jobs which tend to be done by women are seen as less valuable and are consequently underpaid. In particular this might include things that are traditionally considered ""women's work"" such as cleaning or cooking, but the law also covers any job that happens to have a gender imbalance.

So, these ladies from ASDA are saying that they're getting paid less because their job is seen as ""women's work"", when in fact it is of equal value to the work done by better paid men in ADSA's warehouses. The men who are mentioned 1/3rd of the way down the article are making the **same claim** - that they're getting paid less for doing ""women's work"". Effectively, the male claimants are piggybacking on the female claimants.

The same can happen in the opposite direction. There was another case recently where male groundskeepers were getting paid less than female office workers at a university, and hypothetically a woman could have joined in there too. In both cases the basis for the complaint is the Equality Act, which is why it's being reported as a gender issue.",0,1414167064,null,0,1414171357,0,clilq13,t3_2k6tk8,t1_clilq13,t1_clig9t0,null,1426370926,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Ahhh I'm so glad you asked this, as I forgot to mention - although such loans do exist in Germany the market is **NOT** a predominantly buy-to-let market as it is in the UK. It is unusual for a company to rent a mortgaged property, though a company may raise capital via loans secured against their assets which may obviously include their properties. Instead it is commonplace for a company to purchase properties outright (since they are much larger operations they have the capital to do this) or to actually pay for the construction of a new build. Often property developers and lettings agencies may be part of the same group and work together on these sort of developments.

I'm not trying to paint a picture of a perfect rental industry in Germany... they are not without problems - for example there have been cases of German landlords deliberately failing to make repairs to encourage tenants to move out, as this is the only way they can increase the prices by 50%. However, on the whole their industry favors the tenant much more than ours does, which is slightly tipped in favor of the landlord...

Consider if you will, you could live in a property that is a danger to your life - going through the courts to force the landlord to take action can only be done on your behalf by the council if they choose to take up the case (which they might not), is likely to take up to a year to achieve and will likely result in a revenge eviction before the case is ever actually heard in court... in contrast, if the landlord wants you out and can conjure up a reason then they can fill out a special **[online form](https://www.possessionclaim.gov.uk/pcol/)** and have their case fast-tracked through the courts, usually resulting in an eviction within 1-3 months depending on if it has to be enforced. It's a good example of how a landlords money is more important than a tenants life and wellbeing. It's because our rental laws are outdated and hark back to a time when landlords were wealthy aristocrats who mattered in the eyes of the law and their tenants were illiterate peasants who didn't. The very term land**lord** is perhaps outdated in this regard.  ",0,1414167592,null,0,false,0,clilzyn,t3_2k6efn,t1_clilzyn,t1_clikbdl,null,1426370797,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The UK pays membership dues to the EU (it isn't a tax) like all other nations. In part these are based on the size of our economy. 

The EU's own statistics agency have revised up growth figures for some nations and in part this is because they were previously under-calculating the contribution of services... well our economy (unlikely Germany and France) is almost entirely based on services rather than manufacturing... so our bill has gone up considerably whilst theirs have come down. Of particular concern and bemusement, they also seem to have included the size of the *""black economy""* (i.e. good and services which are traded illegally, like drugs and prostitution)... however this is bizarre since those industries are by definition not taxed, and so the state is expected to pay for something that it has decreed is illegal.

The EU has asked for that money to be paid on or by 1st December... which is pretty ambitious since it amounts to 25% of our entire annual EU bill. To put it in perspective it's twice the amount of money the NHS are asking for as a year on year increase, or around 2% of their annual budget. 

Cameron has now said that he a) won't pay the bill by the 1st of December and that in effect it was rude to ask us to pay a bill without explaining how it was arrived at and at such short notice. b) More subtly, he is also suggesting the government would like to have a look at the figures themselves and I suspect they will want to take issue with the revision that includes the black economy in the figures.

I suspect that a signifcant part of the reason we have engaged in the debate that we have is that you actually may well be a fundamentally decent and well-meaning individual. So, I'll explain why we might disagree so strongly on this matter.  
  
From my perspective a fundamental error in the perspective from which you are analysing the problem where the problem is should a prospective employee disclose current salary.  
  
If I am understanding your argument correctly, then you are arguing the matter from your perspective as a recruiter. Whilst that gives you significant and important insight into the matter that the prospective employee should take in account when evaluating the problem, it is not the perspective from which they should be approaching the problem and therefore should not act as the determinant in their decision-making.  
  
There is also a very major mistake you are making, but is one that everyone makes including myself and it arises because we cannot get past our own cognitive biases.  
  
Because you are a good, decent and intelligent person who seeks to act in the best interests of other you are making the fatal mistake of assuming that the values and weightings and significance you attach to matters and the moral calculus you perform in evaluating to determine the approach that consider to be best are the same as those that any other reasonable individual would make in the same or similar situation in order to follow the apparently correct approach and reach what you would consider to be the apparently correct solution.
  
Unfortunately, the reality is that that is very much not the case. That is why you can have two people such as David Cameron and Ed Milliband who are, in all likelihood, two fundamentally decent, smart, well-intentioned individuals can disagree so vehemently on occasion as to what the best approach and most desirable solution might be to any given problem. It is a disagreement between two people who do not share the same value system and do not perform the same moral calculus. There is no need to imagine that one or the other is the living embodiment of the Prince of Darkness and the other is our own personal Jesus Christ.  
  
It is of absolute importance that we must recognise and understand this and try to truly consider and evaluate a matter from the perspective of another rather than being limited by our own cognitive biases. And it is this failure to do so which can help explain why people we would take to have been very smart and very well-meaning can end up making catastrophic mistakes and causing great suffering without that ever once being their intent.

Probably sounds dumb at first sacrificing a midfielder for one of these, but two weaker strikers just looks much better than one weak striker trying to do everything (at least on paper it does). I'm hoping this does two things: 

1. Make Borini have some form of protection to stop him going down too much/targeted by defenders too much. 

2. Make Borini's runs inspire/motivate Balo/Lambert into making runs of their own and getting forward. Or at least give them something to aim at for a flick on. ",0,1414171939,null,0,false,0,clioddy,t3_2k7adz,t1_clioddy,t1_clinwz1,null,1426369690,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Shirt-swapping happens frequently at the end of games. No issue with that.

We have a long-standing custom where players do this, mainly because it makes sense to do it after the final whistle as the player no longer needs the shirt and it can be a nice memento to claim another shirt. Still no issue.

This is a custom reserved for when a match is FINISHED. Why on earth when you are 3-0 down and trying to battle the perception that the game is over, would you then do something that always happens at the end of a match? It sends out the message that the match is over, plain and simple and that is really disrespectful to his teammates and to the fans.

The reason Steven Gerrard would not swap shirts at half-time is because AC Milan were his enemies for the next 45 minutes (and beyond) and he knew that. If Gerrard had swapped shirts at half-time it would have sent out the worst possible message ""even our captain, one of the greatest players in the world thinks the game is over"".

No one would know its the real thing.  Hows that for hiding in plane sight. Lol

I used a link one of the posts suggested and it gave some wonderful facts about Tardis.  I liked how Time Lords imprinted on their Tardis and the idea that Dr Whos Tardis is a much older, out of commission model.  Tardis are also designed for more Time lords to operate them at the time they are to make those time jumps and that explains those jerky movements the Doctor gets while traveling.  Also Tardis get so attached to their imprinted Time Lord that if something happens to them, the Tardis will grieve and go away to die.

The distribution centres job involves loading the cages and putting them on the lorry. This is male dominated and paid at ~£11ph.

The shop job involves a variety of things, which includes bringing the cages off the truck and unpacking the cages (as well as stacking the shelves and working the checkouts, serving the customers). The same cages which are loaded at the distro are unloaded at the store. For £7ph.

Once upon a time it might have been that the shop job was less physical than the warehouse job, (and it seems that the shop warehouse used to be higher paid but was pulled in line with the rest of the shop) or maybe not and it was just lower paid because shop work was womens work and women were worth less.

However these days they are parallel. But because of the history of it the shop job is paid less than the distro job. If the distributions of male to female workers were the same in both jobs it's probably be down to negotiation, (ideally this is where a union would come in - but then this is walmart), but in this case a gender disparity still exists between the female dominated shop job and the male dominated distro job. It can be argued that while the jobs are parallel, that the pay gap exists because of the gender disparity either because of a current bias or an uncorrected historical bias. This gives the workers a recourse to the discrimination law.

Asda then has to show that the jobs are different enough and produce a difference in value for the company enough that they can justify different pay grades.

He doesnt chase down defenders that are 10 yards away from him. He lets the opposition all the time in the world to play it out from the back.

But:
He sulks, he turns his back on the ball, he blames everyone but himself.
He doesnt smile, he doesnt celebrate the goals, he stands around thinking he's a big shot and doesnt want to look like he's breaking sweat. He's got this attitude of ""its uncool to look like its hard""

Bottom line is:
He was brought in to score goals. But doesnt even look like he knows what runs to make to get in a position to score. He's not displayed any footballing intelligence you'd expect a striker to have. So you're right he's got no attacking vision. But this tunnel vision he's supposedly got is absent as well. 

I've lost track of the amount of shots he's had where he's had the shot blocked by a defender 5yards away from him. Its fucking poor, if a professional striker cannot judge if he can get a shot out, or if hes better trying to create more space first.

I've not given up on him, and think the way things played out with sturridge out have made it unfortunate for him. 
But he really needs to change his whole outlook on the game if he's ever going to make a name for himself for the right reasons at liverpool.

I'm not sure exactly what the process is for returning a stolen bike and recording it as part of the bike's history (I only had one stolen that was covered by TPFaT and it was never recovered), but none of it will be good. 

I would fight tooth and nail to have it written off. It doesn't take much to add up a repair bill that will be more than the cost of the bike and I would point to every scratch, every dent, every leak, every cut on the tyres, the state of the oil etc. I'd also ask that the frame, headstock and suspension be carefully inspected. Anything to avoid having to take the bike back and have to explain to the next buyer that 'it was just fine' despite being stolen and, no doubt, ridden like a rented mule.

false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"I love punk, but i can't stand this bullshit narrative; that Punk was a great Unifier, that young people flocked, peace broke out and everybody lived happily ever after. It may have had that effect for a tiny subset of people, but a great myth has grown around it. Punk happened during one of the most turbulent periods of the troubles and did little if anything to dim the conflict.
The Punk scene had an ugly deeply divided side to it. For example The young Johnny Adair who would later become a leader of the UFF, was a young skinhead and started a punk band.

&gt; As he grew older Adair took to the streets, forming a skinhead street gang with a group of young loyalist friends, who ""got involved initially in petty then increasingly violent crime"".[4] Members included Donald Hodgen, Sam ""Skelly"" McCrory, ""Fat"" Jackie Thompson, James and Herbie Millar.[6] Adair, Hodgen, McCrory and Thompson were classmates at the Somerdale School on the Crumlin Road.[3] Although the gang still officially attended school, they would frequently play truant, take a bus into the countryside and consume large quantities of cider.[7]
&gt; 
&gt;  The gang regularly congregated outside the Buffs Club on the corner of the Crumlin Road and Century Street, where their numbers were swollen by other young men from in and around the Shankill.[8] Eventually, Adair started a Rock Against Communism-styled band called Offensive Weapon which openly espoused support for the National Front.[4] As a 17-year-old Adair began a relationship with Gina Crossan, three years his junior and herself a skinhead girl, who at the time had shaved her head to leave only a tuft of hair at the front.[9] The notoriety of the gang, which was part of a wider group in loyalist north and west Belfast known as the ""NF Skinz"" because of their support for the ideas of the National Front, gained widespread notoriety on 14 January 1981 when ""Seig Heiling"" members launched a brutal attack on anti-racist fans of The Specials and The Beat when the two bands played a concert at the Ulster Hall.[10] This was followed in August 1983 by the so-called ""Gluesniffers March"", when 200 skinheads descended on Belfast City Hall determined to riot with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament members who were themselves holding a rally, with the march taking its name from the prevalence of solvent abuse among the skinheads.

No one would make the argument that Suarez didn't work his ass off for us last year. I looked for reliable, current stats about amount of ground covered, and I couldn't find any numbers, but I'd feel pretty safe betting my house that he's much closer to ground covered of other players than 50%. And he's a striker. Also keep in mind, while criticizing his willingness to track back and press, that he got loads of flack for not staying in the 18.

What really puzzles me about this argument is that, watching the games, I've never though, ""shit, Mario doesn't even look like he gives a fuck."" In fact, I've often been impressed with his hustle to track back or close down the GK or defender when others aren't. I've actually thought, ""well, at least Balo is pressing"" while watching. It has been amazing to hear commentators criticize him for not putting in effort when it doesn't at all mesh with what I've seen. Lee Dixon, for instance, talked shit about him solidly for 5 minutes or so because he didn't play in Hendo on a counter last weekend.

Assuming that

 - It takes 2.5 hours to defrost a layer of rolls

 - A bag is 0.2m by 0.2m

 - There are 35 rolls in a pack [source](http://groceries.iceland.co.uk/iceland-35-profiteroles-535g/p/54624)

You would have to eat (1,000,000,000 x 35 / 100) / 2.5 an hour. Thats 140 million an hour. 
Or just below 40,000 a second (38,889).

According to nutrition information on the [Iceland website](http://groceries.iceland.co.uk/iceland-35-profiteroles-535g/p/54624) there are 351kcal in 100g and there are 35 in a pack of 535g. Therefore one roll contains 53.65 kilocalories, or about 225,000 joules (1 kilocalorie = 4184 joules). Therefore you would be consuming energy from the rolls at a rate of 8,729,453,605 joules a second. 

Almost 9 terajoules per second!

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) the entire energy use for the year of 2008 globally was 143,851 terawatt hours. There are 24 x 366 (2008 was a leap year) hours in 2008. That means energy use was 16.4 terawatts per hour, which is a poultry 4.5 gigawatts per second (0.00456 terawatts per second). 

9 / 0.00456 = 1,975

This means that you would have to consume energy at almost 2,000 times that of the entire population in 2008 to be able to finish the first row of profiteroles in time for the second row to have defrosted. You would then have to keep up this energy consumption for another 247.5 hours to finish the whole lot. Although you would get breaks when its night and the sun isn't shining.

&gt;The expression __anecdotal evidence__ refers to [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence) from [anecdotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote). Because of the small sample, there is a larger chance that it may be unreliable due to [cherry-picked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy\)) or otherwise [non-representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics\)) samples of typical cases.   Anecdotal evidence is considered dubious support of a generalized claim; it is, however, perfectly acceptable for claims regarding a particular instance. Anecdotal evidence is no more than a type description (i.e., short narrative), and is often confused in discussions with its weight, or other considerations, as to the purpose(s) for which it is used. This is true regardless of the veracity of individual claims.

Stony Stratford high street for drinks. The Vaults bar is my personal favourite. 

Wolverton has a historic walking tour. You can get details from the town council. While you're there, Ouse Valley Park is very nice. Or you can get on the canal and walk to Campbell park or out towards Cosgrove. 

Bletchley Park. 

The Craufurd Arms is the best live music venue by far. 

Just into Northants, up the A5, is the Super Sausage cafe. Top grub (it is a bit Ace Cafe-esque).

The Parks Trust organise events all the time. Have a look at their website. 

Stantonbury Theatre and The Chrysalis Theatre if you are into AmDram.

He fell from +2 to -5 this month, although the consolation for him is that he is still the best regarded of all of the party leaders, including Farage.

Landlord (or somebody) is paying the building rates, but I've been reporting maintenance issues and nothing ever happens.  Letting agent is doing their bit with aplomb and say themselves that it's the landlord dragging his heels.

I've been in the same flat for just over two years and it really is falling apart.  Needs redecorating in parts, some of the window hinges are going funky, intermittent fault with the stove top (built-in hob), couple of the bathroom lights have died completely and don't work with new bulbs - all reported, nothing done.  The stove top was even looked at and diagnosed by the approved repair man, but not fixed, because landlord hasn't or won't authorise the repair.

The dishwasher broke last year beyond economic repair.  No problem, just go to Currys and buy an identical model for £250 and it can be delivered and installed within 24 hours.  Too simple and easy a solution?  You bet.  Five weeks and a dodgy gang of ""approved persons"" later... after the landlord had said they'd ""struggle to afford"" a replacement despite it being about 30% of my month's rent.  Where was the rest of the money going?  Are they really that hard up that 100% of that rental income is indisposable?

Seeing as it's been two years, I'm thinking of moving out because change is good.  The landlord will just have to fix things and redecorate if he wants another tenant, so either way he's liable.  No skin off my nose and not my responsibility/problem.

However, if you're new to the game it changes rapidly and you need to confirm your odds when you place your bet. Some companies give the best price on the win. We use one of them often. 

My top tips as someone who loves the horses is to get to know who the jockeys and trainers are (owners not so important) and know the difference between different kinds of races, different lengths, different ages in the horses.... I win quite often but it's not definite or it wouldn't have that frisson of the horses fighting for the win.  If I'm at the racecourse, I always watch the horses in the paddock. You can see how they feel on the day, often. Also, learning to read their form on a screen or in a paper can help. 

I also tend to always bet each way on my horses. My SO is an ex-bookie so I'm fortunate to have that knowledge backing me.... but I win more often. ;) I've learned who are the best jockeys on certain courses and how to read the form. It makes a huge difference. I'll see if I can get him to calculate the difference between your bets for you. It'll not be much. 

Finally... learn how the odds work. They go in and go out. 11/2 is a better set of odds. 6/1 is longer but would win you more money. I never bet more than a pound or two on any race but I've paid for several days out at the races using what I've learned. And I'm an amateur. Good Luck!

Edit: 11/2 odd are calculated at 5.5 and 6/1 at 6. So your win margin depending on whether you did an each way would be minimal unless you bet a significant amount.

This is probably the key piece of this puzzle. You need to put together a list of your needs in order of their priority and consider the potential outcomes and how they tie into these needs. The information you've provided here is helpful but doesn't provide the full picture: for example what assets do you have, how much money do you need? You should focus on what you *need* and which option(s) meet(s) those needs.

For example let's say you turn down the payout and in a year your employer terminates your employment, you say that in that situation you will be unemployable: do you have enough assets to provide you long term support as someone who can't work? If you're sitting on a net worth of £50k in rented accommodation taking this risk would be a **terrible** idea, but if you're sitting on £1m in liquid assets in a property you own outright... it's a risk you could perhaps afford if you think that the long term insurance payout is a possibility.

Worst case, best case, balance the risk. Don't look at the risks line by line, look at them as part of scenarios and pick the scenarios you can deal with and then take whatever action necessary.

Before they were confident of out-scoring every team, now they don't have that threat (without McFadden, they also let Higginbotham come to us for free who is brilliant and very creative) and have gotten far worse defensively without losing many players.

I see the match unfolding in two different ways.  One Jose goes for the kill right away.  It looks as if Drogba will be our only front man fit, so no sense in trying to leave this one late.  Get an early goal then play defensively and try to catch United on the break.  Press high up the pitch immediately and grab a lead and try defending it for the remainder of the match.

Secondly Jose could opt to play conservatively for the first 70' or so, and goes for a late goal by introducing an attacking presence.  Everyone knows that the impetus is on United to go for a win.  I think Chelsea can beat United in an open game attacking the width of that United defense.  I also think Chelsea can defend and catch United on the break.

Since 1970 when the public discussions on the EEC were coming to a head, the UK has had General Elections:-

* 1970 (MPs) 18 June 1970 Edward Heath Conservative
* 1974(MPs) 28 February 1974 Harold Wilson Labour (minority government)
* 1974 (MPs) 10 October 1974 Harold Wilson Labour
*  James Callaghan 
* 1979 (MPs) 03 May 1979 Margaret Thatcher Conservative
* 1983 (MPs) 09 June 1983 Margaret Thatcher Conservative
* 1987 (MPs) 11 June 1987 Margaret Thatcher Conservative
*  John Major 
* 1992 (MPs) 09 April 1992 John Major Conservative
* 1997 (MPs) 01 May 1997 Tony Blair Labour
* 2001 (MPs) 07 June 2001 Tony Blair Labour
* 2005 (MPs) 05 May 2005 Tony Blair Labour
*  Gordon Brown 
* 2010 (MPs) 06 May 2010 David Cameron Conservative (formed coalition with Liberal Democrats)
* 2015 (MPs) 07 May 2015




Summary =

* 11 General Elections
* 14 Prime Ministers
* 5 Labour; 6 Conservative; 1 Liberal Democrat Government stewardships

Let's compare our public direct vote to sack the government in Brussels:-

*  5 June 1975

&gt;*Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?*

It may have escaped your attention that the only those who voted in 1975 have voted for ""Ever Closer Union"" politically towards a Federal Superstate.

The EU Elections for the Parliament don't even allow such an option. Secondly, they don't and have not addressed the continual loss of power and sovereignty to the EU with a vote per New Treaty:-

* 1975-NA European Council conclusion
* 1985-85 Schengen Treaty
* 1986-87 Single European Act
* 1992-93 Maastricht Treaty
* 1997-99 Amsterdam Treaty
* 2001-03 Nice Treaty
* 2006-NA EU Constitution
* 2007-09 Lisbon Treaty (= 90% EU Constitution)

Here's [a graph of EU gain in Policy Powers (and Member's loss in Sovereignty) Overview](http://s1004.photobucket.com/user/Suri42/media/Treaties_Sovereignty.png.html)

During that time with no vote on it.

&gt;*Mr Cameron started with an admirable reform agenda, which would help the whole EU. If he makes demands that will never be met he will set that agenda up for failure—and also raise the chances that vexed Britons will end up voting to leave the EU. That is a high price to pay for a few UKIP votes.*

As for the article, what hogwash. Cameron's reform Meme aka ""Wilsonian Fudge"" is all about ""The Middle Way Fallacy"" political trick on the British to keep them in.

Logically:-

1. No Change = Sub-Treaty reform = Wilsonian Fudge
2. Amendment via Article 48 / New Treaty = ""Non-Ever Closer Union"" = Ruled out by EU and other leaders as ""impossible""
3. Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty = Brexit = Negotiate with EU on EEA entry with EFTA membership and as co-equals on Single Market minus ""ever closer Political Union"".

**The dirty secret of the EU is not only the failure of the EURO, but also the Treaty Structures themselves** are ""stop-gaps"" not workable over the long-term due to their purpose as stages (""Engrenage"") towards Ever Closer Union of a Federal Superstate United States of Europe.

The Treaty Structures are flawed and hence to work with them is flawed. Hence as per Catch-22:

&gt;*""Do Something Different outside the catch-22""*

There's no ""male premium"". There are plenty of women willing and capable of doing the same job to the same standard, there are just statistically far fewer.

If, for example, black people were on average physically more capable of performing such work, would you call it a ""black premium""?


&gt;for doing physical tasks if they do find it easier since they are physically stronger?

Generally an employer will pay in relation to the value of the work performed. How hard the individual employee had to work to perform the task is of no concern to them, and it's absurd to think it should factor into amount paid.

And there comes a point when that impairment is negligible.

I'm not assuming it. I know it to be true.

&gt; I want to minimize accidents related to the consumption of alcohol, which is a clearly delineable and practically enforceable thing.

But what on earth do you mean by this? Are you sure you mean minimize and not eliminate? Let's say a BAC level of X% increases your chances of causing an accident by 0.1%. Given enough car journeys, someone with this BAC *will* have alcohol-related accident. Should we be worried? Absolutely not.

&gt; And so what anyway, again you're appealing to consequences.
