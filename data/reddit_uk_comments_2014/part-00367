Keepers - Greeno was a class keeper, was sad to see him go when we went down and don't hold it against him at all. Always had a soft spot for Shaka Hislop as well. 

Defenders - Julian Dicks was my hero when I first started going to West Ham as a kid. All action defender with a rocket of a left foot! Probably the main reason I fell in love with West ham. Definite mention for Tomas Repka as well, he was an absolute beast.

Midfielders - Obviously Mark Noble, local and loyal and a great player. Steve Lomas was a great player and another big reason I fell in love with the club as a kid. I was a big fan of Benayoun as well.

Strikers - Paolo Di Canio of course, don't need to say why! :p Loved Tony Cottee and Paul Kitson when I first started going, with John Hartson coming after. Always liked Zamora too. And of course Carlton Cole! Not the best striker we've had by a long shot, but a club legend.

false,MeandMyM80s,null,null,"Matic [Alpha build v9.12.3] log | Dec 04 2014 :

It is perhaps time for my monthly confession, I am not as good as I potentially can be. It is not because I pretend to play one hundred and fifty one times worse than my capabilities to blend in, it is not because my AI has not fully comprehended the sciences, but purely because for one simple reason; consumption.


The humans have a funny way to go about their activities. They consume (consume ref log 2321 : Converting mush into brown smelly mush) the worst possible nutritional substances and try to yield the best possible energy outcome, it quite simply doesn't work. 

Junk food makes no sense to me. The humans seem to enjoy it so much even though it is turning their already obsolete bodies into the round projectiles we use in the tactical ball kicking game [error : Joke algorithm offlline]. The humans spend more time preparing, dressing and perfecting their food than they do consuming it. A simple cost/benefit analysis will show them that they waste more nutrients preparing these complex mushy substances than they will gain by consuming them. We had someone very knowledgeable in the field called Dr. Carniero warn us about this but as always I was the only one listening. To top it all off they do not understand how to maximize the potential of the raw ingredients already present. I heard a lady say one time at the collective consumption location me and human Branislav Ivanovic were energizing at say that she wanted her animal meat cooked ""well done"", that is the day I remember giving up on humanity. I excused myself and left immediately. 


And yet inherently by design I have had to feed on the same substances that the humans use. My superior built in modules are now dedicated to backup power and emergency conditions and have been turned off to blend in. It limits me and I can feel it. I feel the clogging in my hydraulic pumps and the slower movements of my carbon fibre appearance module. I can see all the lack of nutrition in my slower processing power of my trillion core i82132152134^324 processor and the scratching of my weapon systems, some days while getting to my charging dock I grab and blend every human consumption element I find on the way into a comparatively superior mush but even that is not enough. I feel weak, I feel like a worse - less updated - version of myself. It reminds me of the hit Kelly Clarkson single ""What doesn't kill you make you stronger"", perhaps that isn't the case for me.


We were facing another club from very close coordinates during a moon cycle. I knew moments like these made the supporters (supporters ref log 23144 : drunk fellas) very competitive. I was standing in the tunnel, a place where the rest of the comparatively superior humans stand to get their plan in place because they forgot to do so earlier. It was then that I noticed something out of place, the main power board was open. 

Realizing the safety concern I went over to close it when I saw the hazard sign (ref log 32411 : Anything with Hazard in the name is dangerous and should be befriended), ""Danger : High voltage - Main power line"". 

Could it be? That is what I was designed to run on before all of this inferior systems were activated. But maybe it was not a good thing to do, I thought better of it and turned around. That is when I saw for the first time close up Jan Vertonghen's face. So full of pride and hope, so full of arrogance like he was better than everyone else. Then I saw the imposter Kane, a mere obsolete image of my favorite WWE fighter. I saw Lennon talking about how he was faster than the human ""Bolt"" next to Eric Lamela who seemed inept to even comprehend what we were about to do tonight. This made me turn around as I held the cable while projecting a hologram of myself while everyone else was walking out.

It was unlike anything I'd ever felt. My charging dock was nothing compared to it. The electricity surged through my body, every clog was opened, every weapon system at full power, my processor computing faster than ever as time went slower than I had always been able to manipulate it by. I could feel the power, it opened my optical stems. I had held on so long that when I turned around I saw that my consumption was destroying my designated home base. The lights were flickering to my internal reactor's beat. They were going to turn off at any second. Everyone else had walked out and so had the hologram that I'd been projecting of myself as a distraction, it would lead to panic and chaos so I snapped out of it.


It took all my effort but I took my hand off but the damage was already done. I had discovered a way to unlock even more of my potential. I knew it would be difficult to blend in after today for what I had discovered because I could not possibly put in a bad enough performance to seem human. I knew what the humans were thinking, their next move and what they were trying to do in the future, a new advantage I'd never had before. Maybe it was for my own good and I shouldn't care, I remember the feeling of being so weak and I never wanted it. I'm not going back, at least not on the more difficult tactical competitions held during the moon cycles at my designated base.


then the match began.....


Day #1021314 : Unlocked another side of me. Blending in will be difficult but they still don't suspect a thing after I mind controlled Giles Smith to make a statement.

false,justthisplease,null,null,"Lots of interesting stuff in those papers, but none to diminish the UN argument. The UN paper looks at the problem much more holistically than just ""yields"". Inputs vs outputs in terms of yields is also important and the main problem being how sustainable is ""conventional farming"" (not very). 

&gt;Conventional systems rely on external inputs to maintain soil fertility. Some of these external sources are finite (e.g. phosphorus and some micro nutrients) which may become a threat to this type of agriculture in the long run. Also, future energy scarcity may influence farmers’ access to fertilizer nitrogen through increases in prices. Phosphorus depletion may affect conventional and organic agriculture. In conclusion, a thorough analysis of the productivity of organic and conventional agriculture at crop rotation, farm and regional level is needed that accounts for the availability of crop nutrients

The benefits of organic farming are clear, the smaller yields could well be balanced by the benefits to the environment of organic farming organic farms.

&gt;To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.

Needing more ""land"" also does not mean needing to cut down more forests or even use any new land there is loads of great technology out there; 

Rooftop farming needs investment as does indoor farming, aeroponics, hydroponics, vertical farms, robotisization etc etc

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Hence Sinn Féin being in a position to demand an Irish Language Act.

And Unionists being in a position to refuse it.

&gt; That's in the Agreement because Sinn Féin negotiated for it to be included, so yeah, it's probably safe to say they were supporting their Irish Language Act.

It might be in it because they demanded it be but as there is no specification as to what was to be in the act, there is no agreement on what needs to be put in it. I dare say to avoid SF being able to make their demands.

Therefore no one has agreed to make Irish an official language, hence why it hasn't happened and I thoroughly hope we won't piss away the time and money required to make it one.

&gt; As for it becoming a 'de jure' language: why do you think Wales and Ireland are referred to? It couldn't be because they've both given their native language official status, could it? Hmm, you know, that seems likely.

Again that is probably why that was put in there but there's no need to follow their example only to ""reflect on their experience"". I still don't think having a language act similar to there's is a sensible idea and I still maintain it is a waste of time and money and frankly you've given no argument that would even make me consider otherwise.

&gt; I wouldn't push for it, since I have no interest in it and it's a joke, but if the price for protecting the Irish language is continuing the Ulster Scots charade, then I'm all for it.

You might think that but surely the St Andrews agreement being signed by all parties means that Nationalists in power believe it to be as valid as the Irish language?

Or you can acknowledge that just because something is in that agreement doesn't make it 100% valid or necessary to follow.

Not if they want corporation tax devolved, which is the point of the article...

&gt;It might be in it because they demanded it be but as there is no specification as to what was to be in the act, there is no agreement on what needs to be put in it. I dare say to avoid SF being able to make their demands.

&gt;Therefore no one has agreed to make Irish an official language, hence why it hasn't happened and I thoroughly hope we won't piss away the time and money required to make it one.

&gt;Again that is probably why that was put in there but there's no need to follow their example only to ""reflect on their experience"".

I really don't care whether you'd consider it or not. I'm explaining to you why I and most nationalists will support Sinn Féin in demanding it.

&gt;You might think that but surely the St Andrews agreement being signed by all parties means that Nationalists in power believe it to be as valid as the Irish language?

Actually, I'd say their opinions on the matter are exactly the same as mine: it's the height of unionist pettiness ('themmuns got a language, I want one too!'), but in the interests of protecting our *actual* language, we'll play along.

&gt;Or you can acknowledge that just because something is in that agreement doesn't make it 100% valid or necessary to follow.

No, I don't acknowledge that at all. It's not a list of guidelines, it's a legal agreement and one of the cornerstones of the peace process. Why spend decades trying to reach agreement if either side is able to unilaterally renege on terms they don't like?

The amount of help and support you guys showed for a person that you don't even know (me) is incredible. /u/getox you are a legend my friend! This would not have been possible without your help. We checked Essentials earlier in the week and to our dismay, we found nothing (and when I say we, I mean Allyson as I am currently in California). As I said in a previous comment, a visit to Sainsbury's turned out to be unsuccessful as a friend helping me out went to the wrong Sainsbury location. It was only because of your information that we decided to try Essentials again! So once again, thank you Sir! If you are ever in California I want to meet you and give you the biggest bro hug! You are truly awesome. 

Thanks everyone else, especially /u/StepByStepGamer  that offered to even make a trip up to campus to deliver the ice cream! I have no idea how I could ever show my appreciation to you guys. 

This means the world to me guys. My faith in humanity has been restored. I hope one day I can meet the wonderful People of Kent! You all seem like an incredibly nice and sincere group of people.

Breastfeeding is natural because we're mammals and, to put it in biological terms for you, the young get their food from the lactating teat.

The right to breastfeed is enshrined in law because your ""traditional and stuffy"" people (who aren't yourself, honest!) spent the 20th century (and perhaps the 19th, too, for all I know) discriminating against women.

We have performed this ""physically intimate act between a mother and child"" in public for thousands of years, at least - banning it is a victorian sensibility, not a ""traditional"" one.

Finally, let me say that I am one of those who is uncomfortable with women breastfeeding in public - it makes me think ""gosh! I don't know where to look"".

Yet, I recognise that that's my problem - prudishness, the result of my upbringing, no doubt - not the mother's, and I have no right to constrain anyone else's liberty just to make me comfortable.

&gt; Looks like a whole lot of weasel words to me. Unsurprising, given that that's what the British are best at, but disappointing since our peaceful coexistance is due to and dependant on those agreements.

Weasel words? I'm interpreting it literally if SF wanted it in the agreement they should have put it there. Frankly your views on British people are disgusting by the way.

Also focusing on one agreement like that is absurd, do you even have any idea how many have been broken in the last decade by both sides? You can't possibly try to push through an Act the majority don't want based on that.

&gt; I really don't care whether you'd consider it or not. I'm explaining to you why I and most nationalists will support Sinn Féin in demanding it.

and that is why you'll never be able to convince Unionists to give you it.

&gt; No, I don't acknowledge that at all. It's not a list of guidelines, it's a legal agreement and one of the cornerstones of the peace process. Why spend decades trying to reach agreement if either side is able to unilaterally renege on terms they don't like?

They aren't going back on any terms, it was never agreed to make Irish the National language.

&gt; Oh, but it's not either side, is it? Always seems to be one side weaseling out of agreements.

""Liverpool.""
""Okay mate - you need to wait over that side and get off the next met after 2 stops. From there head across to the shopping centre and ask for directions to Victoria.""

false,wemadeahugemilkshake,null,null,"Defensively he is miles better, eriksen has less fouls because he barely puts any effort in his defending, reminds me a lot about messi in recent years.

Gylfi might get dribbled past more, which has more to do with acceleration than anything, he still makes much more interceptions/tackles(that stat is inaccurate on the website) and is miles better at heading(which is apparently a weakness yet, eriksen doesn't have it?) and defensive duties in set pieces. Only a fool would dispute it.

Attacking wise, I can understand that Eriksen has more passes. While you claim Gylfi ''goes hiding'' I feel it is much more down to his team mates simply not giving him the ball. Unlike Tottenham, Swansea play with actual wingers, and a very active striker(which we only recently got). Which means the ball is much less passed to sigurdsson. 

This was very obvious in the early stages of the season, where shelvey/ki/carroll would rather cross/lob it over gylfi or pass it around him or even at times run past him. But since then this has changed drastically (aside from the game against arsenal, he was rarely ever given the ball due to montero having chambers number)

And when it comes to shooting, Sigurdsson is still adjusting to the ''swansea way'' and is often times not in a shooting position due to the current tactics. However he is trying to change this fact and is shooting much more, and in the recent 4-5 games he could have had anywhere from 2-5 goals. And he could have even more assists. In the early stage of the season I remember bony/ki missing open goal chances against newcastle/southampton, and in recent memory bartley missed a header against QPR. That is not accounting for all the other games we've played.

Compared to Eriksen, who has been pretty lucky with some of his goals, and hasn't had many goal scoring opportunities at all. But he pretty much should have at least one assist for that tackle against the scum.

Ironically Sigurdsson has better crossing than eriksen according to the website, does that mean eriksen is a WEAK crosser?

He has a higher passing percentage, and eriksen only has 48 passes per while sigurdsson has 36. He is also 0.25x better at keypassing.

Eriksen doesn't even have a through ball registered this season!

The only stat I see eriksen actually has the upper hand on him is his long balls, which is fair enough because gylfi rarely ever attempts them, but he is good at it none the less while I don't really have an opinion of eriksen's.

So to sum it up, Sigurdsson only has ''key passes'' and defensive contribution as his strengths, while having crossing/aerial duels(which he both MUCH better than eriksen at) as a weakness.

While Eriksen has longshots as a strength(even though he never scores goals that aren't incredibly close to the box or inside it.) Set pieces(have you SEEN his corners? Probably the worst in the league) and taking free kicksm key passing/general passing.(which sigurdsson is better than him at both)

Free kicks are debatable. Eriksen is more effective as close as possible, while gylfi is better from distance, and has much more power/technique. But when it comes down to free kicks it's the conversion ratio that counts, which Gylfi is currently better at both on national team and for club, but eriksen had a spell a while ago where almost every freekick he took was a goal. Which gylfi has only experienced at swansea on loan.

I'm impressed that eriksen has been chosen motm twice, but gylfi is currently twice as good as him goal contribution wise, and miles better defensively and passing wise.

Eriksen's only chance at one day being better than gylfi is down to his age, but considering how eriksen's playstyle is based around reaction timing/acceleration, his form and abilities will only become worse as time goes by. And since he is already very weak and poor defensively, if he starts focusing on bulking up and defending more he will only become slower and less offense minded. While sigurdsson who is a 6'1 ectomorph is capable of bulking up and expanding his game vastly more than eriksen physically could ever.

Tottenham will regret playing/keeping eriksen over sigurdsson, this is already been proven defensively and it will only eventually/inevitably become a fact attacking too.",0,1417812040,null,0,false,0,cmmb5ft,t3_2ocpzu,t1_cmmb5ft,t1_cmm0d3k,null,1425585227,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

false,DocOccupant,null,null,"Funding from adverts: the thing to remember about that is once a channel takes on ads, they stop making TV shows just to make shows, they make or commission them so they can sell ad space around them.  That becomes the primary reason for their existence.  The result is generally crap TV.

Ad space in some cases is way more sought after that in others, so a 90 minute game of American football lasts three hours because every time the ball goes out of play there's an ad break. 

Taking ads puts the channel in the pocket of the companies that advertise.  Top Gear, for all its faults, is at liberty to say that the latest Gofastercar is a pile of crap.  American Top Gear can't, because if they did Gofastercar might pull their support and not buy ad space around the show.  So it's another form of ransom.

You might think that you can tune out ads and ignore them, but you can't.  So every time you watch commercial TV, you're allowing yourself to be influenced in a number of powerful and subtle ways.  Ads are insidious and I like having a way to take breaks from them, or not deal with them at all.

BBC Worldwide, which is the arm of the BBC that sells shows abroad, does contribute, sure.  In 2013/14 it brought £178 million back to the BBC and did help reduce the licence fee...but couldn't replace it.

You have a unique service - three broadcast and one online channel, a catchup service, a load of specific channels for cable/satellite and the radio services - for basically not all that much money, and for a cost that has been reduced yearly for the last couple of years.

And I can compare the licence fee to income tax.  I really can.  Both are levied by the government, both will incur penalties if you don't pay them and the payment of both is a legal requirement of being a citizen and fulfilling certain criteria.  For example - watch live TV or listen to the radio?  You pay the licence fee.  Have a job that earns over about £10k a year?  You pay income tax.

My contention is that you don't want to complain about income tax (although you should, especially given the value we see from it) but you do want to complain about the BBC because it does deliver value but someone else has told you that you can have better for free.

Or like tactical changes like yellow carded jordi amat being taken off 1-1 against chelsea for world cup finalist fernandez who simply was not ready for the league yet was the sole reason behind the three goals after only playing 30minutes or something.

Bony getting a ridiculous red card, shelvey getting a red card for blocking a set piece too close, shelvey giving a penalty away that wasn't a penalty, and a red card to rangel which was rescinded, and several very questionable referee decisions offensively and defensively against us.

I'd say the only team swansea ''deserved'' dropping points against were city and chelsea. Both the games could easily have been draws or even wins. 

Tottenham have been relying on coming back for a very long time now, poch had absolutely no influence in that respect. Poch sold sandro sigurdsson livermore and fryers, while loaning out carroll/fredericks/holtby. There are only two players there that I mention that could possibly have NOT been important for us this season and it would probably be fryers and either carroll or holtby. The rest would almost instantly walk into our current xi and we would have a completely different and superior team. Imagine sandro/livermore next to bentaleb or fredericks at rb. Now we're struggling specifically in the positions we sold for. (positions we previously were VERY strong in are now our biggest weaknesses)

Tactically they look clueless like they did last season when getting assfucked by chelsea, city, or even shitty liverpool. I cant imagine what it is going to look like when we face united or [swansea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jMfVQmlt4#t=219).

Just drop that shit about poch, he is a shit manager that kept southampton from reaching their true potential, much like moyes was for everton or how manchini/avb were for city/chelsea. And I would put money on him being sacked within the next 2 years if I could.

The actual 12.5% rate was introduced in 2003, as the culmination of a plan of graduated reduction which kicked off in 1998. But as the article noted, Ireland had been pursuing low corporate taxation for decades before that, just in ways which didn't directly impact on the headline rate (Ireland's corporate tax rate was 40% in 1995, for example). So it's not a particularly useful comparison to the situation in NI.",0,1417814461,null,0,false,0,cmmchdl,t3_2ocute,t1_cmmchdl,t1_cmmbo3q,null,1425584611,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1
false,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"This is a difficult one. I am all for personal privacy but I understand the need to spy on people who have bad intentions or are breaking certain laws. Everyone has an inherent right to privacy and the way I see that, if you've got something you want to keep private, don't tell anyone. The second you tell someone or transmit that secret anywhere, you've chosen to hand that secret to either another person or you have entrusted its safety to a company or some piece of technology that you will never be sure you will have full control of. If it's your private information and you want it private, keep it to yourself. 

With regards to secret courts making this decision, I can't really see any other alternative. The whole reason the intelligence services can do certain things that they need to do is because their methods are secret and revealing them would make them less effective, so yeah I have no problems with that. 

It's difficult because there isn't a single person here who can comment with any kind of authority on the topic, because the topic itself is one where nobody can actually have all of the information and even if they did they couldn't comment on it. 

I suppose most of the comments so far in this topic demonstrate to me some of the things I hate the most about Reddit, a site that i really enjoy being a part of. The way people fixate on certain actions about governments/government agencies/big companies and that makes those entities bad forever and the assumption is always that they're all rotten to the core, based upon very little evidence. An individual or a group that is considered minority or unfortunate does something, fuck yeah let's find a way to blame those entities I mentioned before. There is little or no objectivity here most of the time and it makes it very difficult to take this site (and this sub) seriously, because the bias is so great, so that's why I personally end up keeping away from 'serious' topics and stick to the porn, the offbeat stuff and the fun stuff.

The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) is Europe's largest association of hackers.  This sounds dodgy but realistically it just means that its an informal group of nerds with a bit of an interest in IT security (amongst other things) As far as hacking goes - this group is fairly benign. 

There are 2 main reason why it is important.    
1/ By censoring sites that are at aimed at security research, the UK gets left behind the rest of the world.  Anybody who understands enough about computers to be bothered about blocks like this will not be put off for more than a couple of minuets anyway.    
2/ Someone, somewhere has decided that this site is a bad thing and we, the public, should not be exposed to subversive ideas such as protecting privacy or having a secure computer.  As I said, this group is fairly benign and although anarchistic in nature, there are a lot more worrying groups about. 

On the whole its a bit like banning page 3 and anti porn groups as part of the whole BDSM censorship thing that's just arrived.  It illustrates beautifully just how out of touch the people creating the legislation are.

Edit - I forgot.  CCC is also one of the organisations that's currently taking GCHQ to court for privacy breaches.

I wasn't saying that was a great life for horses, but its a load better than circus animals as they actually can have time to relax and don't have such a brutal training regimen. As the RSPCA stated on the topic of why circuses are cruel: “ [Animals are subject to] Cramped and bare temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and crowds of people are often unavoidable realities for the animals.” - The difference for horses used for racing and shows is that their needs can be met and they have a permanent home (aren't always on the road, shows are very rare and you require medical confirmation that they can perform). There is a lot of regulation for horses in racing to ensure their needs are met - you can't use human logic on what ""their needs"" entails, we must leave that to scientists.

Also, horses aren't tamer inherently, no animals are, not even humans (hence why europeans thought native americans were savage due to their culture not being ""proper"" in their view; culture and what we define as being domestic takes centuries to evolve). They behave due to their upbringing. All animals of certain intelligence can be trained to behave ""domestically"", such as the lions and tigers used in shows and the killer whales at sea world (although when poorly trained, people die and you hear about it).

The bill actually refers to [all animals being used in circuses](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-animal-welfare/supporting-pages/wild-animals-in-travelling-circuses). They use the term wild animals because ""domestic animals"" aren't used in circuses generally. I'm not sure if horses are classed as domestic as they can be wild (loads run wild in the new forest).

He doesn't do anything out of the ordinary when he is saving the ball. His reflexes aren't the quickest we have ever seen. He is not the best penalty saver. He is not the best when it comes to saving one-on-one breakaways. And btw, his performances this year are not even close to the best performances by a goalkeeper. We have seen goalkeepers who have had a better tournament and conceded less goals than him. He is only receiving all this attention because he runs well with the ball and his team won the world cup. There were countless matches that his team would have easily won with one of the goalkeepers from their academy. He rarely did anything noteworthy in many games. Also, how many top strikers in world football does he even play against week-in week-out in the league? How come he didn't have a commanding performances against the best club teams in the world? He failed to stop shots against big teams in the UCL, his team was knocked out by Real easily and he was at fault in numerous occasions. No one seem to mention his bad games, but we can't stop talking about what he does with the ball outside the 18 yard box. How many saves doesn't he even have in a season? He is best goalkeeper at the moment, but i don't think he can pull off those stunts against the best strikers in the world. You just saw what Aguero did to him. Some fans on /r/soccer make it seem like he is the best goalkeeper in the history of football and that he is extraordinary in all areas of goalkeeping. Even while playing for the best team in Bundesliga, he still failed to break the all time clean records for keepers. Edwin van dar Sar, achieved that in a more competitive league. If keepers like Buffon, Cech, Courtois and van dar Sar were playing for a team like Germany and Bayern, they would have had a better performance in the world cup and the Bundesliga.

Prior to that period, the whole debate seemed to be a fringe issue on the BBC. Which is ridiculous when you think about it because a Yes vote would have prompted the biggest change this country has seen in living memory.

To be fair to them, after following the lead of the newspapers, the BBC did get pretty involved .. but like we have been saying, it was still pretty lucklustre in terms of quality. The Robinson/Salmond drama was only one issue.

At a regional level there were trips to ranges where you could fire what they called an L98; I don't know if that's the actual name of it.  It's a modified single shot version of the SA80.  They're 5.56 mm calibre (NATO round) so a lot louder, a lot more kick and a lot more exciting.  

Obviously all of this shooting is heavily regulated, the storage of the rifles was in secure lockers bolted to the building, we had to keep the empty cases to be disposed of properly, and the number of rounds issued and shot was closely monitored.

We also did clay pigeon shooting at a camp once, that was the same as what I assume a normal clay range to be like.

My brother and I also bought a succession of various air rifles that we would shoot in the garden.  We'd do the typical stupid teenager stuff like shoot deodorant cans on bonfires and stuff.

I would say that people who live in the countryside are more likely to have guns. Of course some gang members in London have guns but I think you'd be very unlucky to see one in reality. 

Ok - I've thought of some people I know who have shot guns. My dad and uncle have been clay pigeon shooting. One of my friends has a boyfriend who goes shooting birds. In our house in the attic we have a very old air rifle, never used in my lifetime. 

If I wanted to shoot a gun?  I honestly have no idea how I would even get in contact with a gun tbh.I guess I would have to find a hunting club? Do we have firing ranges you can walk up to in England? 

One last thing, which you didn't ask. When I go abroad to places where all the police have guns I am fascinated and scared. I stare at the holster because it's so alien to me. I've never been somewhere where normal people are allowed to have guns in public, or maybe I didn't notice but I think that would really scare me and I would not feel comfortable.

The Beeb is huge and wonderful, etc. but it is not even close to the only source people will ever need or want - it's a Jack of all trades and master of nature documentaries, basically. The papers know that and are each secure in having a future telling their own brand of the news. The papers don't even compete with the BBC. No one with a subscription to a newspaper is going to give it up because the BBC might offer better value or a more balanced opinion - most people buy a certain newspaper to have their beliefs affirmed, not challenged.

The Daily Mail knows they have the far-right and the frightened elderly; the Telegraph knows they have the uptight businessman and the Times the slightly more metropolitan businessman; the Guardian know they'll always have the students and creatives; while the Sun knows they'll have the white van men. Probably all of those groups will watch the News at 6 or 10 every so often, but most wouldn't see the paper they read as competing with the BBC - the Torygraph readers will *disparage* the BBC, but they won't give up the TV licence in case they miss Downton Abbey or whatever shit is on these days. The two spheres are quite separate, is my point.

Some of the papers are probably encouraged by their owners to oppose the BBC for the same reason that their owners oppose most public-funded operations: because it discourages a culture of taxation. News publisher owners don't have a list of pet policies that they try to push through their columnists; they just want to steep the public in a general mistrust of the taxman, so that (as is usually the case when you can retain a certain percentage of the accountant and lawyer populations) when alterations to the tax system are made, they are the ones likely to benefit most.

It's fairly useless to try to pin down a newspaper for attacking a certain policy for its own sake - they'll retreat to their general political standpoint and hit at another target. If you want to take a paper to task for something, ask why their attacking that policy, ask why they would attack anything, and form your own central standpoint that can oppose theirs on any topic. Then start a newspaper and try to use it to influence elections.

If you want to try shooting, it's pretty easy to join a local rifle club. You can also try full-bore at ranges like Bisley: http://www.nra.org.uk/ (our NRA isn't crazy!)

I think you are letting the tax incentives distort your view a bit. 

The money isn't free, theres a 2% handling fee as you say, but also it relies on you paying off the balance in full as soon as the interest free period expires. 
Who knows whether that will be convenient in 18 months, and if you start incurring interest you'll end up being in a deficit pretty quickly.

I wouldn't bother personally, the risk/reward just isn't there imo, and Im a fairly high risk investor.

Where are these mythical high interest current accounts?

false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"The only way to understand it is to watch... Ask questions if you need to, myself and a load of others on here are happy to talk through any of the finer elements.

Football is so much about gameflow and what happens off the action- there are a load of enthralling games (when you get the sport) that end 1-0 because of the tactical backwards and forwards. 

Everton are even more so than a lot of other teams, as our play is based on how we aim to dominate the game with what seem like pointless phases. Under Martinez our play is based on passing a team out of the game- we move the ball around and wait until we can drag the opposition out of their shape, so there are spaces in the defence that we can exploit. 

It is easy to ignore a result, and watch a game fresh (you can get downloads from a number of places)- then go to the post match thread on here and look at the thoughts. I try to post something at least a little insightful, and guys like /u/himinahomina and /u/practically_floored are also very good (amongst others... I am pretty drunk right now, so am not going to go on a list), and I am sure are more than happy to answer any questions. 

As a very quick overview of things to watch in football:

Defensive positioning. Very important, watch how opposition moves are broken down, some teams go off the ball, and some like to close down forwards when they are active. 

Transitional play. How defensive moves are switched to attack. Some teams play the ball long, and others have runners who drive the ball forward. 

Pressing. The pressure a team puts on the ball when out of possession (not always in a defensive phases). If you watch Spurs, they fucked us with this. Whenever we had the ball, anywhere in the park (including when Howard was on it) they swarmed the active player. This is quite a new thing in English football, as often pressing was only done high up the pitch (when attackers were on the ball), but it is becoming more and more prevalent in the English game. Borussia Dortmund were the masters at this, until they started shitting the bed this year...

Overlaps, and unpredictable movement of the ball. This is more of an Everton based one, as we are the best in the league at it (and even were under Moyes in his later years). We find space in odd areas of the pitch, and move the ball into areas where players are more 'free'. The overlap is when a defensive player overlaps an attacking one and offers an attacking passing outlet- the best example is when Baines overlaps on the left and plays a first time pass into the box, or Coleman overlaps on the right and attacks the opposition box. Watch how we get the ball to these players, and how the rest of the team focus their passing (often 1 or 2 passes ahead of the killer ball) to accommodate this. 

The best player to watch is McCarthy. He is often our most important player, but he is very 'quiet'. Cliche would say he does the 'dirty work', stuff that is vital, but doesn't attract attention. Most newer watchers will not notice his work, but once you start looking you will see how he is vital to the way our entire defence sets up (he both intercepts play, and tackles players as soon as they get the ball) and how we press (he is always near the ball in important areas), how we transition (he provides a very reliable and varied passing outlet when we have the ball).

If you get McCarthy, you get football at a pretty intrinsic level. It will take you a fair few games to understand his importance, but when you do- you are looking at football in a way that you will be able to enjoy it a lot more.

Basically it would be calling someone a homosexual. I guess a modern way to say it would be to call someone a faggot. 

Homosexuality was not regarded by the Viking peoples as being evil, perverted, innately against the laws of nature or any of the other baggage about the concept that Christian belief has provided Western culture. Rather, it was felt that a man who subjected himself to another in sexual affairs would do the same in other areas, being a follower rather than a leader, and allowing others to do his thinking or fighting for him. Thus, homosexual sex was not what was condemned, but rather the failure to stand for one's self and make one's own decisions, to fight one's own fights, which went directly against the Nordic ethic of self-reliance.

Stephen Fry is gay, so obviously he wouldn't like this.

Of course, ex heads of state have massive perks, savings and post - leadership avenues for obscene revenue (look at the millions someone like Blair or Clinton can make for a few speeches a year). 

The PMs salary is artificially undervalued, as are a lot of roles with public exposure and high risk. This is one of the many reasons our political class is made up of people with already self - sustaining wealth. How would you attract top industry talent when they're worth orders of magnitude more in the private sector with much lower risk and exposure.

false,pjz4302,null,null,"The reality is that juveniles and young offenders are just like other people in that they are individuals with their own backgrounds and stories and motivations and so on. You can see very common trends in them such as bad upbringings, substance misuse, dishonesty, no father figures, manipulativeness, poor educations, mental health issues and the lack of ability to cope with stress.

There are some who are very ""normal"" or even ""privileged"" who are just bad people though but the overwhelming majority are the products of their environments.

What needs to be done is for each young person to be looked at individually and dealt with accordingly, what will work for one will not work for another towards achieving a result, which would be to stop reoffending. Now by the stage I come into contact with these ""children"" they have already had years of contact with social workers, psychiatrists, educators, doctors and so on and it has all failed. Usually they have had years of bail (almost always breached), deferred sentences, treatments, suspended sentences, curfews, treatment plans and so on and they have failed to curb their behaviour. It really takes a significant amount of fucking up on their part to be remanded in custody.

When repeated stays in custody also fail ( remember when they are in these centres there are all sorts of things going on to address their behaviours and attitudes) and they continue to hurt people where do you draw the line?

I've dealt with 13 to 18 year olds who get out on the Friday and they get lifted on the Saturday as they don't want to be out. Each time they do something they are hurting people and doing permanent damage to peoples lives. They wont end up inside for shop lifting a bottle of juice, GBH for example is a different story and when talking to them they say they have done it because they don't want to be at home or in a care home!

There has to be a line drawn somewhere and honestly some of these kids (a minority) will never be decent members of society. They are violent and dangerous and will ruin someone's life. Its sad, its usually not their fault and it is a professional failing on my part but at the end of the day that is what it is and people need to be protected.

There are others who are repeat offenders who behave the way they do because they enjoy it and there's no real reason not to, the way to deal with those ones is with stiffer sentences and a more robust regime so that being remanded is a deterrent.

Others will never offend again once they get sentenced but that's a small percentage but that's one of the goals and a good result.

And there's everything in between.

What I used to think, and what many people especially on reddit think is that there is a simple answer and a one size fits all solution and there isnt at all. 

I think there should be a sort of three strikes rule to it where the first time is the soft approach, the second time the soft approach again but the third time in it should be more unpleasant and for a longer duration. And while they are in it starts off for a week or two of a severe regime so that they know pissing about isn't  going to be tolerated.

They also need to have three levels of regime. A standard regime which is pretty alright but not great, a reward regime which is much better and a punishment regime where things are shit, but with the opportunity to be moved back to a higher regime fairly quickly through good behaviour. It would allow more control over behaviour and again reinforce good behaviour and punish bad behaviour.

As it is now a juvenille could come out of their room, assault a member of staff, then go back to playing video games that day. Actions need to have consequences otherwise there is nothing to break their cycle of behaviour.

As it stands the Juvenile/Young Offenders systems are all carrot and no stick, the borstals were too much stick and not enough carrot. We need a system that is much more balanced as leaning too far one way or the other never works.

Sorry that's a rant, I've been up for like 36 hours and cant quite seem to get my point across. But the main thing I'm trying to say is that we need a fair and balanced system of reward and punishment to go along with all the help these young people get and that it must be tailored to the individual. And for someone who has never worked with these people it must be remembered that they are not in this system for nothing and that many are very dangerous people.

And it works because 99.99999% of people are people that won't just go up to other people and shoot them or stab them or rape them. They are just normal people.

Then there are the other people who will do that and they are crazy. They don't follow the law, they just hurt people. When that crazy person comes to kill you, you can either be armed or unarmed. Either way the crazy person is armed with a deadly weapon, a knife will kill you just as easily as a gun and they can have either. But if you are armed too then it is just weapon versus weapon, not you being killed by default.

The police won't protect you, that isn't their job. Their job is to clear up after you have bled out in that alleyway. Protecting yourself is up to you. I would rather live in a society where we aren't taught to carry rape whistles and beg for our lives in schools.

Everyone has their own calculus for cost/benefit analysis. For you to start carrying a gun, it would require a lifestyle adjustment, significant cash outlay for the gun and related stuff, plus the time and effort to learn how to use it properly. And all that effort for something you're not interested in and don't even see a need for it. So for *you*, the cost/benefit is preposterous.

But not everyone is just like you. I shoot pistols competitively as a hobby. So I have the guns/gear/proficiency whether I carry or not. The added cost of carrying is the 5 seconds it take to strap a holster on when I get dressed in the morning. There's really no inconvenience to it. You don't even feel it. So why wouldn't I? The odds may be small for any given person, but terrible things do happen to people. For *me*, there's so little downside to having a small pistol on me that I think its worth it. If I never need it, great. It costs me nothing to have it handy anyway.

I'm extremely well trained and experienced. I guarantee I can outshoot the *vast* majority of police officers in any country. And there's zero chance of me going on rampage or committing a crime. And if I was going to do that, would I care about whether I have a permit or whether its legal or not?

Its strange to you, and to Englishmen, most Californians and New Yorkers, etc. For tens of millions of Americans guns aren't strange. 

Its like a lot of people in rural areas and their attitudes towards gay rights issues. Its not necessarily religious zeal as much as it is ignorance. There are lots of people who have never met a gay person and can't imagine ever doing so. The idea of a transgendered person is absolutely baffling to them.

Obligatory ""fear is subjective"" statement here. Now: why I think the Angels are frightening. Keep in mind this all only applies to ""Blink"" the first episode they appear in.

The format is different: The Doctor is not the main character, Sally Sparrow is. She has to follow fragments of clues to survive, while being pursued by things she doesn't understand. It's a horror-story setup, but unusual in Doctor Who.

The Angels: Everything we know about them comes from [the Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdbLu_x0gY). And the Doctor seems sympathetic towards them. Sympathy with the monster or villain creates a more convincing, and therefore more frightening, experience. Because the Angels are the result of evolution, rather than mad science (Daleks, Cybermen), they seem to be victims as well. They feed on time energy because it's what they need to live, and their defense - the ""quantum lock"" - means they can never interact with any other living creature, including their own species.

The myth: Despite the Doctor's exposition, we know very little about the Angels, including where they came from, why they exist as they do, or what they want. At the end of the episode the only answer is ""hope you never encounter them.""

Later episodes degraded the Angels to typical mustache-twirling villains who killed for no reason, taunted the Doctor, and kept ""people farms.""

however i must go one further... i commend your academic accolades, numerous as they clearly are...  however,

1. i feel as though i am familiar at least with the print media in England... it's shallow, callous, and literally anything that would cause the audience to turn the page... but it is not good writing. 

2. they do not print the news, they print the tabloids...

3. if they give their audience something they don't want, they have test groups and surveys which will cover their asses

I'll give you an idea of how hard it can be:

Here's a completely hypothetical scenario where any resemblance that the participants have to real life players is entirely coincidental and not based on something similar that happened a few months ago which caused Jamie Carragher to kick off on Twitter:

You're sitting in the office, and the phone rings. The agent of a high-profile young footballer is on the line. Let's call the young footballer Raheem. Raheem has a few years left on his deal, but he thinks he isn't being paid enough, as his contract was signed when he was a 17-year-old squad player. However, the club aren't offering him the increase he wants. He complains to his agent. The agent says to you that a big Spanish club that may or may not play in white are interested in Raheem, and are going to bid for him in the summer. 

You have no way of verifying this. You suspect that this is a ploy to scare Raheem's club into giving him a wage rise. In fact, you're certain that it's a ploy, because you get 10 of these calls a week. You know a move isn't going to take place, but there's a chance it might, and you don't want to get bollocked for missing out on a story.

Bearing in mind that Raheem's agent has almost certainly been calling all of your rival journalists in other papers with the same information, do you print it? What's more, do you want to risk pissing off the agent of one of the country's brightest young hopes, or more importantly, your editor?

The above is a relatively simple situation. It gets far more complicated than that. You have agents calling you claiming to represent Club A and saying that they want to sign Club B's striker. You write an article about it. The agent then takes a copy of the story, goes to Club B claiming to represent Club A and says that Club A are interested in their striker, and have leaked it to the paper. He then goes to Club A and tells them that Club B are interested in selling them this striker, and what's more, the fans are already excited. The deal either gets done, the agent collects his commission and you get a pat on the back for your 'exclusive', or it collapses, and the fans start abusing you on twitter for making up transfer rumours. 

I'm just going to quickly answer your questions. For the record, my academic achievements are negligible in the grand scheme of things, and I'll probably end up in PR after getting fired when print media collapses.

&gt; i feel as though i am familiar at least with the print media in England... it's shallow, callous, and literally anything that would cause the audience to turn the page... but it is not good writing.

Firstly, don't lump all the papers together. Some papers, like The Times and The Guardian, are amazingly written.

The rest depends on what you mean by good writing. I personally think that the NYT is badly written as it's too verbose, too up-its-own-arse. It's hard for the reader. The Daily Mail is brilliantly written in my view as the language used is very carefully calibrated in order to maximise the emotional impact on the readers.   

I'm of the opinion that you have to be cleverer to write for The Sun than you do the NYT. A lot of the journalists come from similar backgrounds, but the ones at The Sun have to curb their own style in order to appeal to a very specific demographic.

&gt; they do not print the news, they print the tabloids...

A tabloid is a kind of newspaper. In England we have broadsheets (so named because they used to be massive - The Times, The Telegraph, The Guardian, The FT etc), middle market tabloids (tabloids disguised as broadsheets - The Daily Mail and The Daily Express), and tabloids (usually have a red top - The Sun, The Mirror, The NOTW before it got shut down) 

While infatuated with celebrity culture and rife with PR, tabloids are capable of some brilliant investigative journalism. I don't think tabloidism is necessarily a bad thing, although the dark arts are more common there. 

&gt; if they give their audience something they don't want, they have test groups and surveys which will cover their asses

Nope, they either get fired or sued for libel. If you piss off your audience, they stop paying, and you in turn piss off whoever owns the paper. To my knowledge, papers don't use focus groups or surveys that much anymore.",0,1417836360,null,0,false,0,cmmmt0s,t3_2oa7oy,t1_cmmmt0s,t1_cmmlqye,null,1425579301,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

A police state enforces the law 100% on all citizens using various monitoring tools - cctv, speed cameras, forensics etc.  In an ideal world a police state is what you'd actually want, crime levels are are actually pretty high (when was the last time you were speeding?) because theres almost no chance of not being caught and because theres almost no chance of not being caught whether you're PM or poor &amp; homeless the punishments are a bit more sensible.

Totalitarianism is the social policy of the people serving the state.  You don't exist to make money to watch movies and play video games you exist to make the state more powerful and it'll supply you with what you need (Victory Gin and cigarettes).  Unfortunately often the state takes the form of a political leader or party making them above the law.  Often this leads to the encoding into law of acts against the state being illegal, free speech so long as you don't call out dear leaders fiscal policy as horse manure etc...

A police state is a system where a priviliged few individuals (relatively speaking) have overarching access to information and trusted not to take personal advantage of it in any way. It's about power more than anything else. That's the power to censor, blackmail, cover up mistakes or outright corruption.

There is also the danger of creating a 'behavioral underclass': ordinary people tripping some algorithm somewhere and suddenly being denied fundamental rights (air travel, credit cards or online shopping), people who get strip-searched at every security checkpoint, who get stopped in traffic etc. all without recourse or admission from any authority (""We can't confirm or deny for national security reasons"").

Our current democratic governments were designed with three kinds of power in mind: executive, legislative, judiciary, all open to scrutiny and control by the people.

false,p7r,null,null,"So this is a 3-month old conversation and I'm struggling to remember the original context, but in short:

Your maths don't make sense.

Banks offer mortgages based on a multiple of your earnings. To be buying a 120k property, you would need to be earning at least 35k-40k. You would need to be able to put 12k down up front. You would also have to deal with property taxes, arrangement fees, etc.

If you're earning 40k, paying 2k/month is a tall order, but even at 6%  (a typical rate for a modern mortgage) is not enough to pay off your mortgage in 5 years, you'd still be short by some 20k. You'd need to pay off $2,339/month leaving you $1k a month to live off and pay your taxes.

Ah, you say, but I could be earning more! What if I'm earning $80k/year!? 

Sure, but if you were earning that, it's more likely you are going to either be living in an area with well paid jobs in which case 120k gets you a really quite terrible home, or you are going to want to buy a more expensive home for yourself (and why not? You're working hard)

The way banks deal with this balance as it has played out for hundreds of years in dozens of cultures is that they don't typically offer 5 year mortgages - they offer 25 year deals. In fact, I'm not most banks would even accept a 5 year deal on anything less than 10% interest p.a. which means the numbers get even more stupid: you'd have to pay $2550/month.

On a 25 year deal 120k will cost you $780/month at 6%, a much more affordable way to live. After 5 years though you will still owe $111k on the original debt, so now if the property has slipped in value by 10% you are in negative equity and on selling the property you are going to have to make up a $1k shortfall to pay off the loan.

I also don't agree there is an equal chance of property prices going up as there are going down. History proves that to be naive thinking. Housing always pushes towards people's collective earning power, and therefore you need to understand the employment market, how many buy-to-let investors have over-heated the local markets, etc.

I think for your argument to make sense, you need to show your maths and explain your position in far more detail, but the maths you have shown doesn't really work in the real World - far from it.",0,1417853962,null,0,false,0,cmmsrau,t3_2d52e7,t1_cmmsrau,t1_cmmi50k,null,1425576446,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The early crackers usually weren't malicious - they were curious and occasionally pranksters. And a lot of what they did, depending on jurisdiction, probably wasn't illegal (or at least clearly and seriously illegal) back then. They weren't trying to steal your credit card details - more likely your source code (copyright breach) and mainly just to study it - admittedly partly for more security weaknesses to exploit.

And they sometimes used a fair amount of technical ingenuity - not to mention hacking together some hardware and software tools - to do it.

FWIW it's likely Bill Gates learned a lot from arguably stolen source code that he then applied to those BASIC interpreters in the very early Microsoft days. Of course stealing printed listings from dumpsters out the back of the computer center isn't ""ingenious"", but it was part of the hackers (as well as the crackers) toolkit.

In any case, the language evolves and obviously the media have a disproportionate influence on that. Nevertheless, there's no reason why the meaning of a bit of 1970s niche slang should be preserved forever. In fact the computing-related meanings of both ""cracker"" and ""hacker"" relate to older meanings of those words. There's no reason why a bunch of teenage nerds have special evolving-the-language privileges.

I'm a web dev, I work from home and live in the countryside.  Its enabled me to do this on and off for nearly 20 years.  I have travelled and worked at the same time as it has (with a sat phone) allowed me to carry on working in remote parts of the African bush, deserted beaches and deep in the the Himalayas.  

In my life before kids - I used to have 8 - 10 month working holidays and I ran a niche overland travel business that was completely web based bar the actual travel.

I live in the middle of nowhere and buy everything on line so I only have to go to a shop very very occasionally - which is great because I hate shopping with a passion. 

I met Mrs Dwair on OKC. Actually, I have met all the Mrs Dwairs since 2001 on line.

The Internet has allowed me to live a life that I enjoy rather than trying to shoe horn my life into something else.

false,DanniiTheFannii,,The Guy In The Sidebar (Year 12 - Mod),"I've never looked at the other boards, but I do think that Edexcel is probably **the** best one for philosophy (or *RS*. I just think philosophy sounds better). 

The paper is divided up into 4 sections, each consisting of 4 questions (4 questions therefore makes up one section). On the paper, you have two lots of these questions to choose from per section and you have to choose **one** of them. You absolutely **cannot** choose the first question from one and then do the other questions from the other set. You'll only be marked on the first question.  
That being said, it does sound very confusing, so just ask if you wish for me to clear that up or to clarify anything. 

So, each section is made of an *A type, B type, C type* &amp; *D type* questions. 

* A types are the easiest and are worth two marks. These are usually a definition, but last year they've been introducing things such as ""give two examples of a numinous experience"" or something of the sort. I think I was asked about organs that can be donated (heart &amp; liver for example). So just be aware of that, but out of the 4 sections, there was only 1 of these questions in the A type. The rest were definitions. 

* B types are pretty straight forward. These are worth four marks. You're usually asked something like ""do you think laws on alcohol should be changed"" and you give **2** reasons for your point of view and expand on them. This is all you need to do, but make sure you expand. It could be absolute bullshit, that doesn't matter. 

* C types are the longest, and therefore the most expensive. These are worth eight marks. You're asked something like *""explain why Christians use the Bible to make moral decisions""*. You need to write four points and expand them on why Christians do this (word of God, teachings of Jesus etc. but try not to mention that most Christians haven't read the thing and they ignore the mass genocides, sexism, slavery.. Oh, and the multiple references to unicorns coming down and killing everyone). You have to refer to Christians in this. In this course, you usually look at two religions; Christianity and another one. We did Islam. Don't mention anything else aside from Christianity and the Bible. 

* D types are rather relaxing after the long C type. These questions are worth 6 marks. You'll be asked something such as *""no religious person should support capital punishment""*. You need to give 3 points **for** this and 3 points **against** this. 

I have a past paper (well, a mountain of the fuckers) somewhere. When I finally get my sexy ass out of bed, I'll write out a few example answers to the questions, guaranteed full marks so you can see how they're answered. 

A good thing to mention is that time is **very** limited. If you're doing AQA science, you'll probably find yourself with more than enough time to check answers after. Edexcel philosophy? Nope. The first exam I did (unit 1) was so fucking close to the line that I didn't get to check afterwards. The second exam (unit 8) I ended up missing out an entire section pretty much (still got an A in it over all). Try to give yourself ~23 minutes per section. If you can beat this then you're really in a good position. 

I'll get round to the example answers later today. (: ",0,1417862335,null,0,false,0,cmmub0l,t3_2o36cz,t1_cmmub0l,t1_cmmtp95,null,1425575724,2,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,2

Right now, the top link is ""[12/5/14] Police say suspected burglar shot and killed by homeowner (Baton Rouge, LA)"".

The full text of that story is:
&gt; BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - Police said a suspected would-be burglar was shot while breaking in to a home Friday.

&gt; The Baton Rouge Police Department identified the suspected burglar as James Boyette, 36. He later died at the hospital.

&gt; Police said the shooting happened on Woodhaven Street in Baton Rouge around noon.

&gt; ""He heard somebody in the back of his home,"" said Cpl. L'Jean McKneely with BRPD. ""When he went to investigate what was going on, he saw the individual inside the house and he confronted him and shot him.""

&gt; Investigators said the homeowner found Boyette in a bedroom inside the home and shot him.""We definitely all look after each other, very well,"" said Pete Dawson, a neighbor.

&gt; ""A man at home minding his own business has a right to protect himself and his family,"" said District Attorney Hillar Moore.

&gt; The homeowner will not be charged. 

&gt; Police added Boyette had a long criminal history and had drugs on him at the time of the break-in and shooting.

&gt; ""He was troubled and did have a past and that is probably what led him into breaking into that home,"" McKneely said.

&gt; The shooting remains under investigation.

Interestingly, I don't see a mention there of the would-be burglar being armed, just that he had drugs on him.

So what's being tacitly endorsed here is the death penalty for attempted burglary.

And I'm afraid that I simply cannot agree with that viewpoint; that is not a ""good"" use of a gun, that is a ""bad"" use of a gun.",0,1417863972,null,0,false,0,cmmuka8,t3_2oemo4,t1_cmmuka8,t1_cmmlt4r,null,1425575561,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

When I walked past it last night at 10 O'Clock I could see a total of 4 people in the two bars.

I just had a look at a sample Agreement and on top of the above charges are the following (unspecified carges),

Maintenance Service Charge, Cellar Cooling Only, Heating and Boiler Only, Health &amp; Safety Complience Service Charge, Accountancy &amp; Stocktaking Service Charge, Insurance, Decoration Fund. All plus VAT.

On top of all of that, the Landlord has to pay for all repairs both inside and out.

Your raspberries are probably being shipped from somewhere African or in the southern Hemisphere. Cabbage and mushrooms are (relatively) in season.

Carrots should be OK at this time of year, but can still suffer from cold storage if you're buying the cheap 'value' ones. A bunch with the greens still attached is a much better option.

It says that video on demand pornography has to be reviewed in the same way as pornography made for DVD - that is, the BBFC have to review it and rate it. I'm in favour of that.


The reason these acts are now 'banned' (they're not) is because the BBFC says those practices can't be distributed. It's not a crime to do it, it's not a crime to make a film of it. You just can't sell your film on video-on-demand media.

Despite being an old, big organisation, the BBFC are very approachable and take consumer opinions *very* seriously. If you're in favour, as I am, of restructuring the R18 rating system to change to X rated and XXX rated for pornography and hardcore/violent pornography, then contact the BBFC.

false,munchingfoo,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"The RN is allowed to send you away for 660 days in every three year rolling period. More than half of the guys on my last ship were riding this 660 day limit. Most of those that weren't were new and hadn't had the chance to build up those totals. These figures do not include time unable to go home whist the ship is alongside due to being duty. Shortage positions were on duty in a 1 in 3 roster with the average person being in a 1 in 5 roster.

There are a significant number of people who currently waive those rights. One Chef had 1080 days separated service in the previous 1095 days. The RN would collapse tomorrow if all of those sailors withdrew their waiver, particularly in submarines.

Officers are not entitled to be removed from deployed service due to separated service totals for their first 10 years of service.

My close friend deployed for 2 years coming back for only 3 weeks in the middle. On top of that he was under the sea for the majority of that time and couldn't call home. He lost his partner. He lost his life. Needless to say he's outside now.

In a 9 month period I got three weekends at home whilst operating in UK territorial waters and then the ship deployed on a 7 month deployment with news stories abound that standard deployments would be extended to 9 months to enable the RN to maintain it's tempo with substantially reduced platforms.

Many old and bold (meaning those who served full terms in the RN and have either now left or are on their way out) might read this and think, 'dry yours eyes princess', but then consider the places that our ships are now going. The days of seeing the world are over. You now join the Royal Navy and spend your entire time in the UK working 18 hours a day 7 days a week training then onto deployment in the middle east where you will spend your entire time in defence watches (6 hours on watch, 6 hours admin, 6 hours on watch, 6 hours sleep - 7 days a week).

The hard work is the stick, and it has always been present. No one joins the RN thinking it's going to be an easy job. The carrot used to be seeing the world and visits to places you'd never dream of seeing before. The carrot has gone and the stick is now twice as big.

Due to a large number of people leaving before their full terms are complete there is currently a massive manpower shortfall across key positions. This shortfall is predicted to continue to increase even further.

Whether female captives would be much more likely to be subjected to such assaults than male captives, I don't know.  Clearly more of their captors would be likely to be heterosexually oriented, but then rape of captives is probably much more to do with punishment and power than it is to do with having enjoyable sex, and most ordinary heterosexual men even in a combat situation aren't just going to randomly claim sexual rights to captives unless they themselves are very traumatised or institutionalised.",0,1417870223,null,0,false,0,cmmvlac,t3_2og6fp,t1_cmmvlac,t1_cmmvcxf,null,1425575081,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt;  £12 is about four pints or coffees from the high street, so at a very conservative one drink per hour, it's pretty much guaranteed to be better value than most 'going out'. 

I know what £12 represents - but if I actually want a coffee then the value of that to me is greater than paying for a service I don't really use. I also don't have to pay for a Starbucks membership that entitles me to 5 coffees a month (that I will never drink) so that I am legally allowed to go to Costa

&gt; And up against a gym membership, it's similarly inexpensive; two films a month at the cinema, or a couple of small gigs are the same sort of money. 

These comparisons are meaningless. If I want a gym membership, I pay for one, I use the service - I don't have to pay for a gym I don't use. Paying for the BBC (as you are forced to in order to watch live non-BBC TV) and then not using it is not comparable and is poor value.

&gt; For unlimited availability of about a hundred hours a week of top-flight programming, £12/mo is stunningly cheap. 

Yes, it's cheap *if you actually use it* thanks to the millions of people who subsidise it for you. If you do not use it, it is a pointless expense you could do without. If you don't watch much or any BBC programming then it is a waste of money, and reeling off how many channels it pays for or whatever drama series you happen to like won't change this.

So you'd think from that that the fans would be some of the most open to innovation and novelty that you could find.  

However, it is also a family show, and one that many people come to in their childhoods, anf grow to love then. And, of course, as soonas that happens, and it becomes a part of their childhood, it becomes sacrosanct, and untouchable. It becomes, if you like, a fixed point in the individual fan's personal timeline. Any attempts to change the show in the future will always tug at the sacred past, and threaten the memories fixed in childhood. There will be resistance to that. So much resistance.  

Some of this kind of reaction is out-and-out sexism, but a lot, IMHO, is simply a fear that their precious memories will be affected by changes to the show's future.

We keep on playing it wide towards the half way line doing nothing and when it comes in its either relying on intricate plays from someone central laying off a run with a one two or its playing it wide and crossing. The amound of times we have men up that can make runs inside the penalty area on the flanks but it doesnt happen, Ivanovic didnt do that once today. The way we play is too systematic and if we dont change against cunt teams like Newcastle and Sunderland they will Defend defend and defend till they get a lucky goal. How did we lose to Barnsely in the FA Cup a few years ago?

That said the amount of fouls they got away with was atrocious just hearing the BT sports commentators calling every thumping from behind into a players leg ""a good challenge"" wound me up all game. Mikel missed a sitter of a header. Their two goals were well scored. And Costa I dont think Ive seen him do this more than twice this season, but he doesnt run across the goal to get taps on the ball when it is whipped across the box, he ALWAYS pulls back. How many times have you seen a dangerous ball go across the face of their goal with nobody there to get a touch on it? It's frustration from today, but some things have built up. especially since the Sunderland match, we need to change how we go forward because both Sunderland and Newcastle have played efficiently as cunts against us. How many times do we have men up forward and let them get back, then end up passing the ball back to our defenders on the half way line. The more we let teams like these hold onto draws deeper into the game the higher the risk is to us rather than them.

Cahill was positively dreadful. No ifs ands or buts. Zouma deserves a run in the team.

We missed Matic so badly, if not for his ability to win the ball back and keep teams pinned in, as well as how smart he is for fouling. Their second goal Fabs tries to foul and the play continues, we all bloody well know if its matic that plays not carrying on.

Mikel was okay, him missing the sitter lead to their goal so fuck you mikel.

Courtois was at half and did a volley thing nominate him for Ballon D'Or.

Costa looks like a child who doesn't know where their parents went in the grocery store when teams sit really deep. Saw the same against Sunderland.

The issue was, that the minority were criticizing them, whereas the majority were smears.
