true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;This isn't about me though 

Well in this case it is important for me to know if you're of the belief that we have managed to completely eliminate human bias and emotion from selection processes. I am of the belief we haven't, thus my belief we don't live in that perfect world of always choosing the very best candidate based solely on qualifications and talent.

&gt;it's about specifically weighting talent to a certain percentage of a minority group in order to appear... politically correct? Fair? Even?

We're talking a creative industry here. The rules are more mailable here. No one can tell me all the dross that is on my telly is the very best Britain could produce. There's no wrong or right answer here. I don't find Russell Howard the least bit amusing, but seemingly a lot of people do. Now am I alone? can we categorically say I'm in a minority of people who don't find him funny? No, otherwise he'd be pulling in over 30 million viewers a night. We don't know if another comedian would be funnier or better in that slot. It's a creative endeavour.

&gt;Whatever it is - it's not phrased 'we're missing out on metric fuck-loads of genuine talent from ethnic communities

It doesn't have to be. The campaign started and championed by Lenny Henry already made that argument. This is just announcing one of the schemes to tackle said issue.

&gt;It's more about hitting some mythical number for the sake of appearances.

Why is the number mythical? You seem to believe that the number of talented writers, actors, singers, dancers and behind the camera talent doesn't reflect the population numbers.

The reason so many people no longer care about being called ""racists"" is because for years and years that term has been thrown around when no racism has been involved. 

I remember as soon as new labour came in, until about 2010, I would be told ""you just hate brown people"" or something to that effect.

This has been the tactic of the left for almost 20 years now. They didn't want a debate on immigration, so they just decided to call anyone who opposes it a racist and imply that they hate immigrants and anyone who isn't white. 

Now immigration is at such a great scale and is putting so much pressure on our resources (think about that minister that actually said we need to start bricking over brown and green belt land in order to build housing estates for immigrants, or the head of the NHS saying that in some areas in London it is overcrowded and on the brink of collapse), it is finally, just about acceptable to talk about immigration without immediately being equated with Hitler.

It has taken some time, and UKIP are partly responsible for bringing these current conditions about. The left can thank themselves that people are voting UKIP. They ridiculed and unfairly demonized anyone with right wing views as being a white supremacist and a racist for over 20 years. Now, those people don't care about being called a racist anymore.

The term ""racist"" has lost all meaning to me, except in a historical sense, which is a shame, because it is a real term that we absolutely need. Yet it has been abused so much that now whenever I hear someone accuse someone else of racism, I automatically assume that it is just meant as a smear, and the sad thing is, most of the time it is. ""Oh, you oppose mass immigration? You're a RACIST""

You can thank the smug middle class left wing goons for bringing that about.

&gt; your habit of misinterpreting things

its because I don't understand so am trying to guess. We've been chatting back and forth for a fucking age and I still don't get what is ethnicity, what is nationhood and what is class.  
You've told me that part of African American is history and class:  

&gt; No, where did you read that?

here

&gt; Here in the UK the worst off group is white working class boys. Clearly data has been collected showing that they are getting the shit end of the educational deal. Would they be better off if they were thrown in with Prince William and the son's of Tony Blair and simply called ""British boys"" masking the issues they face? 

You're insinuating its a class issue from this section, aren't you?  

Again the whole premise that someone's ethnicity needs to say more about them then just the origins of their great, great, great, great, great ancestors is a new premise to me. As far as I understand ethnicity is just how you look as a consequence of one's origin, be it Asian, Caucasian, African/Black, etc.  
I mean if we're looking to be more PC then I can totally get dropping ""black"" for African as ""black"" was the term used by the Europeans (negro being the Portuguese word for black) but from my understanding of what you're saying that wouldn't be good enough because it wouldn't distinguish an African immigrant or even children born to an African immigrant as opposed to those whose great, great, great, great grandparents suffered slavery.

Maybe it's my fault, the point of African American is THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR ETHNIC GROUP! I am Nigerian. I was born here in the UK, I am a British national, but I can trace myself to Nigeria, even more specifically to the Esan people of Edo state. That specific. Black Americans can't. The argument that ""African American"" is something other people would like to get in on hinges on this notion that people with a strong link to their ethnic groups would fro some reason like to not know what ethnic group they are in anymore.

&gt;Surely based on all of this oddness you can understand how I feel that the fact that the ""African American"" term even exists demonstrates deep rooted issues with race within the US.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I think it's probably where we'll miss Suarez the most. I think in terms of taking on the big teams who are going to try and play football against us (with the exception of Mourinho's bus-parking Chelsea at least) we have a really good first XI and now a half-decent bench too. I think we'll be able to get quite a few points off the likes of Arsenal, City and Utd, and if we don't I expect they'll be pretty narrow defeats.

The lower teams are where I'm not so sure. I think we'll concede a lot fewer than last season because Lovren in particular is looking a quality signing, but I think the jury is still out on how many we'll score. Last season having to deal with both Suarez and Sturridge would just pull lower-table teams all over the place and with Coutinho, Sterling and Gerrard playing balls from behind them we'd score through whatever parked vehicles they tried to put in front of us.

This season I'm not so sure, because I don't know quite how well we'll be able to break down teams putting six players in the box - Sturridge will score almost any chance he's given, but if we can't provide him with one I'm not sure he can conjure up a goal from nothing as often as Suarez could. Likewise Sterling will have issues trying to run through four players and Coutinho will struggle to find a killer pass if they're leaving no space in behind. 

We need another striker even if Sturridge stays fit just so we can give defences too many different things to have to worry about at once. Lambert gives us a lot in this respect - so will Lallana and Markovic too once they're fit, but I still think without another quality striker we'll be asking a lot of players as young as Sterling and Coutinho to be able to consistently break through well-drilled lower-league teams putting their whole team behind the ball.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt;  I am of the belief we haven't, thus my belief we don't live in that perfect world of always choosing the very best candidate based solely on qualifications and talent.

Forcing a percentage of minority groups will not change that. It just means potentially good applicants from other backgrounds will be turned away - hell - potentially *better* applicants. If we're looking no further than ethnic backgrounds etc. then how can we possibly know? 

It's a daft selection process. 

&gt; We don't know if another comedian would be funnier or better in that slot. It's a creative endeavour.

Again, artificially enforcing a selection based on ethnic group will yield no better results. We watch what we want to watch - we don't need it decided for us that there should be more of minority group X on television. 

The public aren't crying out en mass for this - Lenny Henry is. That's not to say nobody else is - before you go there - but this is an artificial endeavour, pure and simple. 

&gt; Why is the number mythical? You seem to believe that the number of talented writers, actors, singers, dancers and behind the camera talent doesn't reflect the population numbers. Why?

Why 20% then? Do we have accurate 100% dispersal between ethnic groups looking to enter the media industry and it's down to sheer discrimination that mostly white people are successful? 

No. Nowhere is that indicated. 

This is backwards social engineering at its most obvious - deliberately holding the door open for some and closing it for others based on their background - if we swapped black for white that would be shouted down as extreme racism.

In other words they're not openly selecting the best of applicants for any given role - they now have a BAME quota to fill of 20% and if you're one of the unlucky white people who could have been selected for your skills but they're down on their quote - tough luck.

This sets a dangerous precedent for racism ironically reversed in category - with better trained applicants locked out because the company has an equal opportunities quota to hit. ",0,1408386082,null,0,false,0,cjts163,t3_2dvm5w,t1_cjts163,t1_cjtrf79,null,1435304112,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Sturridge needs to get that 20+, that's vital but if we play to his strengths like we did suarez then he should be more prosperous this season than last season, thankfully I think we've improved our chances of him going beyond the 20 mark with additions like Lallana and Henderson finding his long distance game just in the nick of time

&gt;
&gt; Programming is probably safe for a long time although I work on Machine Learning and there is A LOT of work looking at applying machine learning to automate debugging in programming via source code repositories. Inductive Logic Programming was largely founded on trying to do such tasks.

Programmers are a strange group in all of this, as they're the only people who not only are trying to automate everyone else, but also themselves.  Indeed they're the only people who could automate programming.  And, not only that, but they have been automating programming for as long as there's been programming; and continue to do so.

Most, good, programmers hate doing things twice; and hate others doing the same thing twice too.

That's how the likes of Puppet, etc. came to replace the traditional sysadmin.  Make it a programming problem, and then automate it.

The thing is that most paid-for programming isn't especially difficult, in isolation, it's the human factor (other teams, customers, third-parties) that makes it difficult.  Again: most (good) programmers are every bit as much a business analyst (although they might go to great lengths to deny it) as they are a programmer.  Although if humans didn't write it, then one of the biggest causes of difficulty in the software industry (mixed-level groups pulling in different directions) would go away.

If you could find a way of automatically generating software from vague instructions (which, of course, is a really hard challenge, much harder than automatic debugging tools), then you'd still need a not insignificant team (as a percentage of a traditional team) to oversee it all.

It would render the whole process as being mostly a human-interfacing non-job, middle-management for an intelligent system.  Just like other middle-management who solely exist to occupy space on an organisation chart.  They're needed as a buffer for other humans.

Which brings me round to my final thought.  Could increased automation at the bottom of organisation structures make these whole swathes of middle-management, office support, HR etc. redundant.  Could the company-of-the-future be a Chief Executive, a board, and an army of robots?

1. Devices that force air to/through the apparatus for testing.

2. Devices that rely on the air to passively reach the apparatus. 

I didn't recognise the apparatus in the video. What I did see was a long tube attached to the device. That leads me to believe it is a forced air model.  This set up does not take into account higher breathing rates. The reason why it is largely believe that cyclists are more highly exposed is because cycling raises the heart rate and a cyclist would inhale more while pedalling than a sitting person on a bus. Well on this forced air device, the device is sucking up at the same rate across all modes of transportation, really it doesn't tell you all too much about how much pollution someone is breathing.

If it isn't a forced air device, that tube removes all worth from the project. The tube is very long and twists. Forget about it!",0,1408387511,null,0,false,0,cjtsssr,t3_2dvgg1,t1_cjtsssr,t1_cjti0hy,null,1435304551,1,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,1

This has the carrying-the-pennies effect, but can also have other effects if your pay varies through the year: If a bonus took you into 40% tax but you wouldn't be for the full year, you pay a bit less tax in the following months as money you paid 40% on ""falls down"" into the 20% bracket. A month with zero pay but still on the payroll would generate an automatic refund (due to one more month's tax-free allowance). A common one is that if you get a job having been on JSA for a while, your tax for the first couple of months will rise as you in effect use up your unused tax allowance from previous months.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"&gt; In the series, gallifreyans are treated as if they're all time lords.

When is that, exactly? It's easy to say that, but you could say the same about how the Silence are referred to as a species. Yet, as we learned recently, it's actually an entire religious order that spans multiple species. ""People treat them like a species"" is not a very strong argument.

It may be that the show is going in that direction in the near future in order to simplify things, but the distinction between a Time Lord and Gallifreyan was very real in classic Who and I've seen nothing to contradict it in new Who.

There were Gallifreyans before there were Time Lords. The Gallifreyans had no regenerations, they were mortal just like us, until Rassilon invented the regeneration process. Time Lords are not a religious group *or* a species, more like a society. Even if it's true that all modern Gallifreyans have regenerations, there was definitely a time when they didn't.

Without knowing the mechanism by which regenerations are granted to a Gallifreyan, we simply can't say for sure whether a cloned Gallifreyan would have regenerations. Given that Jenny's face didn't change, and the energy coming out of her mouth was sort of greenish whereas regeneration energy tends to be a more red/yellow hue, I'd say it's likely she didn't actually regenerate but that something else happened. If you look at the glow of the Source, it closely matches the energy coming out of Jenny's mouth.",0,1408387922,null,0,false,0,cjtt0qr,t3_2du9xq,t1_cjtt0qr,t1_cjts65p,null,1435304701,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I said the amount is not the issue as long as it is above a certain amount. £250,000 is the same as £500,000 when the person is never going to pay it in full. I will quote the full passage that you've decided to take part of out of context to try and argue a petty point with me:

&gt;[...]the amount is really not the issue, just that it should be much more than a good person would conceivably lose without doing anything to anyone maliciously.

..

&gt;What on earth do you mean?

People (adults who lead normal adult lives, take normal adult risks) can easily lose £10,000 or more either all at once or over a few years. 

&gt;You think she should buy him the equivalent of 3 or 4 houses?

No, because like I said, she would likely never pay it in full. The amount she would pay would be directly linked to her earnings.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; The US does have a race issue, but African American isn't one of them. It's simply a sad reality of a history of slavery.

Personally I don't think its so much the slavery thing but more the bit afterwards. The segregation, the criminalization of black people, the refusal of rights the utter insanity that the whites at the time used to justify their racism (I'm reminded of a story where a white sheriff seeks to ban cocaine because they think it gives blacks ""superpowers"").  
Obviously starting at the point of slavery doesn't help but I feel like there are many paths unwalked that would have resulted in a much better situation than this one.  

&gt; the point of African American is THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR ETHNIC GROUP!

okay, now this makes much more sense. Although most of them could bet ""West African"" and be pretty spot on, but obviously there is a large quantity of different tribes and peoples throughout that area.  
Still I always thought ethnicity was a much more broad term, I mean Caucasian encapsulates Russians and all of Europe, while Asian encapsulates the entirety of East Asia, Indian the whole Indian sub-continent and so on.  
My initial confusion is just about the need to further detail African or Black when dealing with terms that are already super broad.  
I mean.... I don't really identify as a Slav, its not even an option on the forms I get for ethnicity, all I've got to choose from is Caucasian.

Perhaps I just lack a perspective here and being a minority in another country makes one want to be much more specific about ethnicity?",0,1408389857,null,0,false,0,cjtu2pw,t3_2dobue,t1_cjtu2pw,t1_cjtrzco,null,1435305223,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Continho should find himself space instead off running directly at defenders and Sterling should practice his shot power as much as he can (although that shot against Southampton from about 25 yards out was decent).

Welsh is far more widely spoken in the North, with them having a different dialect of the language as well. I would imagine people in North Wales, particularly the Eastern parts, are probably more dependent on Liverpool and nearby areas of England than they are on Cardiff.

I don't think there is any demand for North Wales to have a separate government to South Wales. Though there is potential for a problem of dominance by the south like TaffWolf said (two thirds of Wales' population are concentrated in South Wales), this doesn't seem to have materialised much.

It seems the first response when I ask 'why do you want to leave the EU' from many people is jumping to the 'I bet you think I'm racist for thinking that, you loony lefty', as if that's an actual argument.

And another thing, I'm tired of being called a ""smug middle class left wing goon"" for not supporting an immediate exit from the EU and banning Eastern Europeans from living next door to me, just in case they try to human traffic me. There is a certain irony from UKIP supporters, who seem to spend so long complaining about 'smear campaigns' and name calling, instantly jumping to similar tactics as soon as they are in a position of prominence.

You did. I didn't go and cut my wrists about it but you definitely mocked me personally and made comment that I had an inability to perceive the bias that was apparently blindingly obvious. That's a personal attack, I didn't say it was a particularly egregious one.

&gt;You don't really need me to point out why ads featuring scantily clad women or blokes mocking Wags are negative stereotypes do you?

Yes please. Scantily clad women isn't a negative stereotype of women, for a start. It's *possibly* a stereotype of advertising [particularly to a male audience], but not of women. If anything it's a positive for women, they're being celebrated for being beautiful and desirable.

Blokes mocking WAGs? In which one? The pot noodle advert?

Maybe it would be easier to be specific if we take each advert in turn. I'm not trying to be an arsehole, believe it or not. I'm seriously interested to know where you see the negativity.

I prepared by knowing my maths, mechanics and physics very well, including graph sketching and fermi questions, and I would recommend doing the same. This is not always the case, but I had an entirely technical interview, ie, no opinion/feeling/why do you want to do this course bs. 

However, I would still recommend reading into your first year and understanding what you will do in year 1, as I feel many of the successful applicants seemed surprised by some parts of the course (ie electronics/programming if you prefer mechanical). Knowing the course is important for your own good and understanding the mindset of your interviewers, who could later be your supervisors. 

In terms of specifics, I will keep vague because I cant remember much and it is college specific, and should remain secret. I had a 30 minute test, followed by a 30 minute interview on said test and another 30 minute interview. The test was mostly maths with a bit of mechanics thrown in, learn your c3,c4, fp1 (if you do Alevels). The second interview was more about mechanics, and I think I got a fermi question as well.

I am not disagreeing with /u/seoi-nage , but there are differences, maybe things have changed in 7 years and a different college.

Cam engineering is really good, but challenging even once you get in, im enjoying it. Ill answer any other questions gladly. Good luck.

At least... that's the theory. It's clear from the worldwide economic crash that the system is capable of wide-spread systematic abuse. It's clear that in that case the rules and those enforcing them can and do fail.

It's not like there is a simple solution to the problem, and there's always going to be those who have more, but the sad fact is that so little is even ATTEMPTED to change the way the system works. I don't hold out any hope that the people who we've elected leaders will do anything to change the way the system works to the detriment of those who have the most, even if it would vastly improve the lot of the many who don't.

It's impossible to know what the future holds. Either technology will make some of our problems obsolete, or the problems will simply pile up.

Automation is going to wipe out a VAST amount of jobs. Perhaps it also solves a great many problems, or maybe it merely throws a third of the workforce out of employment. Perhaps we eradicate disease and create new ways of generating energy and food. Or maybe food and water becomes the warfronts of the future.

If I've understood correctly, the system being proposed **is** that everyone receives the income, regardless of employment status. So that finding employment always puts you ahead by the full amount of the new income, without any loss to withdrawal of means-tested benefits.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;1. A united Ireland would provide more political influence for the north. Only 18 out of 650 MPs at Westminster represent the north, but in a united Ireland they would represent a quarter to a third of the Dail. 

The westminster government represents me better than any of the 18 MPs in our part of the UK. The point you're trying to make would only make sense if the region making up NI voted as a bloc, which is most definitely not the case.

And never mind the fact the overall influence of the dail in world affairs compared to Westminster isn't a contest.

&gt;2. There's no point in being part of the British economy if you have no influence over it, and it exists for the general benefit of London and the south east.

18 out of 650 is better than zero out of a European commission that controls the republic's economy, and being honest are chiefly concerned with the very different economies of Germany and to a lesser extent France.

I also hope we are at the top of the list to sign Alex Song from Barcelona (apparently available on a free) he would be a direct upgrade on Lucas, who I expect to possibly leave before the end of the window. This also gives us the option of Eto'o..

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'd advise an old touring bike (i.e., a Pan or a BMW K / R series). 

I was using the Tenere as the winter bike last year, keeping the Bandit for less wet days. Then I  got a '94 K1100LT, main idea was using it for touring long distances. Then I found out that it's brilliant, when the weather is really wet, you're OK. The b'stard runs so hot, your legs &amp; feet are warm all the time. Also its seat is seriously comfy and it was relatively cheap! Similar K100LTs are going for peanuts and older Pans are getting to reasonable prices and even 100k miles on the clock is almost nothing to these bikes (mine has 55k+ at the moment, was 50k only a couple of months ago).

As the weather will get worse, I will have to make a decision. I've been working from home most of the time these months and either I'm going to get rid of the Tenere or the Suzuki since three bikes + one car for one man is just too many. The Brick's done over 5k in a couple of months (just over 1300 miles previous week), the Tenere and Bandit have been seriously under-used, just around 1k since new year and that's just pants.

true,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"My understanding of this is that it would work out more or less neutral for a lot of people. Most of us, one way or another, get £50 to £100 from the government in some form.

People on benefits get it as cash. People in full time work get it in the form of a personal tax allowance. People with children get a bit more. Pensioners get a bit more.

This scheme isn't making everybody better off and causing inflation. It isn't handing money to the rich (currently personal tax allowance and state pension aren't means tested either, a billionaire can claim them). Most of us won't notice a difference.

What we have at the moment is a complex set of systems for giving most people in the country about £70 a week, via various benefits and allowances. It is expensive to run, easy to defraud, and some people fall through the net and get nothing.

Far more sensible to just give everybody £70 a week.

The real kicker is JSA. Currently we give this benefit to people on the strict condition that they do nothing other than search for a job. But there aren't any jobs. Surely it is better to just give them the money and let them do what they like - job search, re-train, start a business, do voluntary work etc. If a tiny minority want to sit on their arses watching day time TV let them, it is their lives ticking away.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Fair enough - but I would say that perhaps some of us here are getting tired of increasingly forced acceptance of other cultures. It's not comfortable - it's rammed down our throats. 

""Feel that television talent should be written around great shows, not getting a certain percentage of other ethnicities on the screen? Too bad.""

""Want to buy non-Halal meat in products across certain high street shops / towns / locations? Not going to be easy..."" 

""Want to walk through your town / city today? Could be tricky - there's a protest going on for that war torn country, or the various religious fanatics are shouting their gospels with megaphones as you try and walk by."" 

""Sorry white girl, you can't wear that short skirt in this town - a lot of the locals are from other cultures and are going to stop and glare at you in the street.""

...And so on. 

I appreciate I'm deliberately cherry picking some of the worse parts for the sake of my arguement but those last three? I could encounter 1 to 3 of those daily here in Birmingham - or at least see others en-counting them. It becomes hard to live day by day without thinking 'hang on, some of this is pretty unpleasant and is heavily based around the culture of others which my government is adamant I must accept'. 

Therefore as we see these stories develop on this sub-reddit etc. it quickly becomes tiring and in a way it helps to vent that here. It might not help from a discussion point of view but with some of these things I don't see there's much discussion needed - it's just another unpleasant adjustment and something we're expected to deal with on a daily basis for the comfort of other's culture. 

It should be possible to say that without being accused of racism or xenophobia etc. - unfortunately vocalising it properly is hard. 

But as we're expected to accept more and more *forced* cultural diversity - it becomes increasingly forced in its delivery. Each new concession - even if small - feels more noticeable when any one of these things might be easier to swallow. Perhaps it's the public forced drive towards multiculturalism that is making each change that much more noticeable. 

I digress / ramble... but it might go some way to explain why people here are tired of being expected to accept every new thing / every change. Other cultures are fine, but let us adopt what works for us - don't force it upon us.

I honestly can't see us bringing in a decent striker with only two weeks left (I hope we do though) not through the lack of trying but just the unfortunate reality that not many are viable at the moment. What I would like to see us do is to lodge a late bid for Xherdan Shaqiri in the hope that he can give us goals and at the same time get a few assists.
I also hope we are at the top of the list to sign Alex Song from Barcelona (apparently available on a free) he would be a direct upgrade on Lucas, who I expect to possibly leave before the end of the window. This also gives us the option of Eto'o.. I'm not a fan of this idea, but he does have experience in the Champions League and can be what Loic Remy was supposed to be in our squad (a backup for Sturridge) and a stop-gap until we can fill the place with a quality striker next summer or in January.",0,1408394894,null,0,false,0,cjtwttq,t3_2dwqau,t1_cjtwttq,t3_2dwqau,null,1435306749,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Not correct actually. 5 US states have legalized driver-less cars, and even have a classification of licence for them. Driverless cars can and are tested anywhere at all in those states.

We are however 12 years away from the first prediction by a major manufacturer, from the release of a 100%, mass-consumption, driverless car. That being when Ford believes they will be doing it.

&gt; We are responding to changing shopping habits by re-launching our take-home pack range in supermarkets.
&gt;
&gt; As part of this re-launch we are phasing out our 2 litre straightwall bottle and introducing a 1.75 litre contour shaped bottle in its place.
&gt;
&gt; Our research shows supermarket shopping is changing and that convenience shops in larger stores are on the increase.  More people are looking for smaller, shareable packs they can fit in a supermarket basket.
&gt;
&gt; We believe our new take home packs, ranging from 1 litre to 1.75 litre will better meet these changing shopper needs.  We will still be offering multi-packs with our 4 x 1.5 litre for those larger families looking for the bigger value packs and shopping for special occasions.

&gt; We would like to thank you for your feedback and please be assured we will share your comments with the Brand Team.

I mean sure some businesses will still require bespoke work, but many won't be able to justify the cost and you can train a monkey to stick modules together whereas programming C++ libraries from scratch is rather more difficult.

Then once it's deskilled, the wages can fall through the floor and the number of programmers required will drop as the job is easier.

If you can accept that as being true (at least in someones mind) or not-really-literal or whatever, why not changing into a wolf?

You thought it was a joke. Absurd or not, apparently it's not a joke to him. Workplace bullying lawyers certainly won't consider it a joke, which is why employers have to be careful. And even though yes, I think that belief is absurd too, neither you nor me gets to decide which beliefs can be tolerated and which can't.

One of the things you've described above as ""unpleasant"" is literally hearing someone saying something you don't want to hear. Some would call that freedom of speech here.

When people are quick to point out a business is free to turn away custom when it's a Christian bakery turning away a gay customer but want to organise boycotts when a Muslim refuses to sell a pork pie you have to explain to me the difference or I'm going to draw conclusions.

On this topic it's as if the status quo *must* be maintained and any disparity is simply dismissed as ""well, white people are just better...duh!"". Yes I'm being facetious but don't you get that's basically what you're saying when you say the way it's done now is perfectly fine, there's no discrepancy and the reason is some inherent inferiority in ethnic minorities, and then get all up in arms if someone suggest you might harbour some racially biased views.

Right now there are a shit tonne of shitty white actors on my TV, from dross like Hollyoaks and anything on BBC3 to all the terrible ""reality"" shows. The backlash here presupposes they are right now the best talent that the UK has to offer. With schemes like the one proposed maybe talent like Idris Elba and Chiwetel Ejiofor may have had more opportunities in their own country rather than having to fly off to another. Maybe Steve McQueen could have utilised his talent here rather than having to go to Hollywood to win Oscars. The narrative that they didn't get a break here because they were not good enough looks rather silly put against their success. Apparently the people in Hollyoaks and the guy behind the camera are much better than Oscar nominated talent.

Nope.

False.

Not equivalent.

I think you have misunderstood one key part of what I have been saying.

I'm not suggesting she ever pays him £250,000. Ever. 

I'm saying she should have been made to pay an amount that she can't simply pay and forget about. With a small amount like £10,000, she could borrow it and then pay the loan off, and it's gone away. With £250,000, she would have to arrange a percentage of her income to be taken to pay it, for her whole working life, which may only actually ever total £10,000 or less, but it will make a larger impact on her life than £10,000. 

I'm not advocating for taking £190 a week from her. Not unless she was earning something silly like £100k a year.

Just having her pay an amount that will never make the matter go away. Just like it will never really go away for the victim.

true,Froolow,null,null,"I think this sub is being way too kind to you - I think you should apologise immediately and unreservedly.

Regardless of whether his belief is crazy or not (and it is absolutely crazy) everybody has a right to a harassment-free workplace. I know you didn't mean to upset him, but it seems pretty clear from your description that he was upset because you made an assumption about a belief he held quite dearly. Don't listen to the idiots telling you HR will side with you in a dispute because being a wolf isn't a 'real' thing - HR will side with vegetarians being mocked for their beliefs (as long as they are not proselytising) so there's no way they won't side with this guy over an issue of personal identity. 

WHATEVER you do, don't take any action about the fact he 'told' on you. Excise the word from every dictionary you own so you don't stumble across it by mistake. Edit or delete any comments on reddit that say anything remotely similar. At the moment your relationship with HR is that you made a mistake which you can apologise for and pretty much say no more about. If they hear you've harassed someone for a claim they made to HR, you'll be out on your arse with no notice and no reference, because it is those sort of claims (not protecting an employee who has made a complaint about bullying) that end up with companies mired in litigation and expensive payoffs. This is similar to any comments you have made about him being 'thin skinned'. He is not thin skinned; he has a right not to be bothered at work. He probably got absolutely shit on at school, and probably has a hair-trigger for people laughing at him. Is his history your problem? Probably not, but since HR have a legal mandate to ensure he does not feel harassed at work and he felt your comments harassed him, it has BECOME your problem, so the measure of you as a man is how you deal with it.

Don't try and be cute about citing your 'concerns that he may turn into a wolf and maul you' because that sort of thing causes a headache for HR, which will cause a headache for your boss, which will in turn cause a headache for you. HR have to take *the right to hold his belief* seriously, they don't have to seriously believe that he can turn into a wolf, so stuff like this is a non-starter even if it weren't going to piss off a lot of senior people. Imagine going to HR with a concern that the new black guy in your office is 'going to harass all the white women', or the new Jewish guy will 'steal all of your money' to get an idea about how much you should not do this. HR might have to take it seriously because of employee rights legislation, but you can be damn sure next time there is a complaint about you they're going to throw you under a bus. That is exactly how much you should not start making cute complaints about something that you are obviously not concerned about in apparent retaliation for that person making a complaint about you. It's funny to joke about on reddit, but in the real world you'll almost certainly be taken to task for something far more serious than just a mistake; if HR think it is a potential sign of bullying a coworker, then you'll be seriously repremamded and a small issue becomes a very big one - no other company is ever going to employ someone who was fired for abusing a coworker.

My suggestion would be to apologise to your coworker in person, explain that you had never heard of anyone with beliefs like his before and were taken by surprise, and that you have read up on the Internet about the beliefs of other people like him to avoid doing anything similar in the future. Say that you are sorry for causing him offence, and explain that it is just because the concept is quite new to you and hopefully it won't happen again. If it is a big deal to you, ask if he wouldn't mind talking to HR about getting your permenant record amended, on the grounds that it was a misunderstanding that won't happen again and not evidence that you don't like him or respect his ability as a worker.

You don't need to be obsequious and pretend you suddenly think being a wolf is a totally sensible idea, but you should make it clear that you want to work together as professions and can move past the wolf stuff. If it turns out to be a wind-up you haven't lost anything, your boss will think you're a hero for getting the problem off their back and you have very strong grounds for a misconduct claim against the employee who was winding you up depending on how you feel you've been treated.

true,StanleyParkSeawall,lfc99,,"Good point. Koeman knew with two deep defensive midfielders, we would be hard pressed to get Coutinho the time and space he had preseason v. Dortmund. They can also both slide over to double-team our outside fullbacks' with theirs as well, so our only real options are to go around with Hendo and Sterling, who both favor chance creation directly heading toward goal, not square balls in behind defense.

It was equally unhelpful to have Gerrard and Lucas in midfield- Stevie's game has become increasingly stationary,  with most of his passes being side to side with Skrtel and Manquillo, or long balls over the top to Hendo/ Sterling. He rarely charges up the middle to make quick interplay with the no. 10 (which is ok, we would be massively exposed otherwise).

But this makes the decision to start Lucas even more puzzling. Why start someone who is essentially useless pass the center circle, and even then not quick enough to serve as a defense stalwart in front of/beside Gerrard? He was most definitely at fault for Southamptons goal, ball watching instead of tracking the runner. Johnson wasn't really at fault for the first. Sure he could have made the tackle+run, but Clyne's run was down the middle, not outside of Tadic, so if Lovren is going to come to the man, Lucas has to be able to read quickly enough to cover for him, especially being 3 yards away. Sure enough, when Clyne does run outside on that next 1-2, Johnson recovers with, it has to be said, a great tackle.

Hopefully Allen gets the start next game, perhaps Can with his size more adept matching City's. They're massive and mobile in the middle of the field with Yaya, a deep dropping Jovetic and a quick Silva to boot. Lucas would be, I'm sorry, not the greatest there.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"The origin of the ""test"", and how comically exalted it's become, really just underscore the absurdity of the situation. It's worth mentioning it to put things into contrast, but it's by no means a flaw with the actual ""test"".

No, it's the inherent flaws in it's very structure. The fact that all of it's criteria are highly arbitrary and incredibly exposed to interpretation and personal bias. There's none of the regimen and clinical structure of a real test, because it really isn't a real test.

I mean, every single ""benchmark"" is grossly flawed by their very nature:

1. **It has to have at least two women in it**  

  Overlooks films and shows with small casts, or that only follow the story of a single person in isolation.   

  A story can intimately tell a richly composed and highly empowering story of a lone woman in a wasteland or a tense situation between a female negotiator and a male terrorist and still be considered ""failures"" by this criteria alone.

  Additionally, this overlooks films and shows where the gender of characters is unknown or absent. Stories that anthropomorphise robots or inanimate objects or have characters of indeterminate gender aren't accounted for by this rule.

  Moreover, this rule doesn't clarify how they are interpreting ""women"". Must they be adult women? Does this exclude biological males who identify as female? The rule gives no indication, and so its entirely to the whims of whatever the conductor's assumptions are (invalidating the test).

  **ADDENDUM:** Some permutations of the test alter this to be ""two **named** women"", as the author of this article does. This only exacerbates the test's arbitrarily exclusive nature, as many stories will have unnamed characters play important roles, if not the lead role. *Midnight* is an excellent example of an important female character who goes unnamed. 

2. **The women must talk to each other**

   Again, another arbitrary stopper that needlessly excludes and fails to properly define itself. 

  It's not uncommon for some films to follow both the protagonist and antagonist, giving each equal character exploration and depth, but never have them actually face each other.

  And what happens in irregular conversations? What happens when it's a conversation of two women approaching a male character with different sides to an argument? Arguably neither are talking to *each other*, but they are clearly participating in a discussion together and respond to the other's dialogue. Do we discount that as well? The test fails to outline this.

  Further, the medium of film and television have a dialogue that's not solely verbal. Some of the most intense, most emotional scenes in either medium occur between locked eyes without a single word spoken. A picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words.

3. **The women must talk to each other about something other than a man**

  Again, this is a pretty shallow benchmark. As if speaking about a male person somehow lessens the integrity of either character in the conversation. Great discussions can be held with mothers speaking of their dying sons or women senators speaking of male heads of state or great queens speaking down of male dukes. 

Great, empowering feminist messages can and are given with reference to men or a man. Arguably, it's impossible to honestly approach the issues of women without mentioning the role that men have in producing that environment. You'd have to have virtual censorship to ignore the patriarchal issues.

Moreover, what's defined as ""a talk""? Within one sentence a female character can speak to another female character about their personal concerns of the mission at hand, but that may segue into discussion of a character who happens to be male. Do we toss the whole conversation out because a man happened to come into the situation?

Now one could argue that you're to use ""common sense"" in making calls within the grey areas, but that's completely against the point of tests like these. It's the same reason that standardized testing will have biases against certain cultures, because they're presuming that their particular blend of ""common sense"" is universal.

But in a proper test, you can't leave things that flimsy. You need to flesh out your criteria, make sure that it's reflective of the actual facets of storytelling you wish to evaluate. You *need* something more than just three short sentences to accurately appraise all film and television.

The Bechdel ""test"" frustrates me *as a feminist*. It's cheap, it's weightless, it's calculating a deep and highly complex issue with no real thought at all, attempting to force things into an arbitrary ""pass/fail"" binary. It's an immensely shallow practice that's sadly overshadowed actual feminist analysis and critique.

And I do want to say, I'm sorry if I've come off too strong in these comments. I certainly don't mean to bash you and I definitely don't mean to demean you for sharing what I'm sure you genuinely thought was a worthy contribution to the subreddit. 

It's just that feminist issues in media are an issue very close to my heart, and it's very frustrating to see people continuing to advertise a broken and shallow replacement for real critical thought.

Who said anything about banning eastern Europeans from living next door to you? That is the sort of ridiculous cheap jibes I am talking about. The UKIP position is that we welcome immigrants from anywhere in the world, providing that they don't have criminal records and they can bring a contribution to the British economy, at a rate of around 30/50,000 a year.

The EU's position is that there should be absolute open borders between every country in the union, with no limits at all. I am simply thinking ahead 50/60 years, about what sort of country we want to live in. If we carry on at this rate of 250/300,000 a year NET migration, we will be an overcrowded country very soon. There will be increased pressure on school places, hospital beds, A and Es, public housing, the welfare system, etc. 

The UKIP position is very sensible. You're acting as if their position is that they want to ban all immigrants from coming here, with your ""ban eastern europeans from living next door to me"" comment. That simply isn't their position.

I'm sorry but insisting that we have a sensible rate of 30/50,000 SKILLED workers a year from ANYWHERE, seems like a much more sensible policy than ""absolute open borders between all EU states, nothing can possibly go wrong, there should be no limits at all"".",1,1408400092,null,0,false,0,cjtzir6,t3_2dw96f,t1_cjtzir6,t1_cjtv6wr,null,1435308084,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Therefore they propose that we limit the amount of immigration to 30/50,000 a year, and also have a points system whereby we choose people who definitely be a benefit to our society. So if the NHS says ""we need more brain surgeons"", then a brain surgeon from India who contacted us and asked to live here would be given priority over someone from the USA who just wanted to work in a bar, for example.

That is their official position and is easily available on their website. Also, you're forgetting, that it is only BECAUSE of UKIP that we can actually have this debate on immigration.

For those who don't know Motor Neurone Disease is a terminal illness with a typical life  expectancy of between 2-5years from first symptoms, wherein motor (movement) function is deteriorated over that period.

Unlucky people lose use of their breathing muscles after a couple of years, and the luckier (I wouldn't call anyone with MND lucky..) lose all limb control but the vital life support control can be supported for a limited time. Steven Hawking is an example of someone who has had excellent care and lived a long time post diagnosis.

My mum (diagnosed aged 52) received first symptoms over two years ago, and currently still has full use of one arm, and can support herself with the other. enough to allow her to walk with her limited leg control.  

What's incredible about this disease is that muscle strength is only lost due to lack of exercise, eg her grip is still as strong as it ever was, but the message from her brain doesn't reach her muscles, or not in the same way or at the same speed. So to pick up a phone isn't any trouble, it just takes time and the hand placement accuracy diminishes over time. 

ANYWAY. Sorry to dump. Just it's so awesome that if everyone learns a little about ALS/MND they may not regard the withered old gal in the extreme electric wheel chair as something to avoid but rather a person who just can't control their muscles due to a cruel twist of fate.

Against a Real Madrid/Bayern/Barca I could see the two Fernan's really breaking up the opponents lethal attacks. The question becomes can we retain possession long enough to go down the field and create chances of our own. This is my thinking (so if you think I'm wrong let me know) Navas isn't as useful here because he doesn't float inside as much into the empty spaces. Milner would put in a shift on either flank and I love that about him. I'm thinking Milner/Nasri, Silva, and Toure in front with Aguero would be what our ideal situation would look like away to the favorites for Champions League",0,1408401475,null,0,false,0,cju06nf,t3_2dvxan,t1_cju06nf,t3_2dvxan,null,1435308362,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

He isn't in an important position in Labour, and would have little effect on Labour policy. I'm completely fine to criticise his views, but I don't believe he represents the Labour party at all.

Atkinson is a new MEP, who has just got her seat. That means she would have been vetted by other high ranking UKIP members, not been allowed to sit because she's an old member of the party. That suggests her views are similar to the other views of high ranking members in UKIP. She represents UKIP, as she holds one of UKIPs most powerful and influential positions. Therefore, you would also expect her to have much more influence over UKIP policy that Mitchell would have over Labour policy. 

You're also ignoring the multiple other examples of UKIP MEPs, like Farage, or Bloom, or Nuttall, or Helmer, having similarly bigoted views.

The story I linked to happened today, and is very similar to the UKIP story, but one is being discussed here and the other is not. The reason for this is that people unfairly see UKIP as a racist party, and they don't see labour as a racist party.

true,inkstay,null,null,"I'm from New Jersey, and I've been a Swansea fan for almost 3 years. If you saw the opening game, you probably noticed the Swans don't get much respect compared to the bigger clubs. I'll tell you a few things I know...whether they matter at all or not is up to you.

One thing that's great about the team is that around 11 years ago, they were almost out of League football altogether, and now they've climbed up to the top level. I believe their situation back then would be similar to the Mariners or Mets in baseball having a really extended poor streak and being on the brink of having to play American Legion baseball...if MLB had the guts to use relegation. 

The fans rallied behind the team, and the a fan organization now owns 20% of the club, if I'm not mistaken. I guess it's something similar to the Green Bay Packers being publicly owned, although in that case maybe the entire team is owned by the fans.

You've joined in after a summer of major changes in the lineup. Quite a few starters have left. Michu, who was wonderful 2 years ago but hurt last year, is with Napoli on loan, probably gone permanently. Ben Davies (pronounced ""Davis"") who is Welsh, grew up as a Swansea fan, and who was affiliated with the club since he was a kid, is gone. He's at Tottenham now...very sad to see him go, but I think Swansea can't afford to pay players a lot of money, so I can't blame him. Michel Worm, Chico Flores, Pablo Hernandez, plus others, are gone. 

Part of the reason they're gone is the change in manager, middle of last season. Michael Laudrup got fired early in 2014...the team wasn't doing so well. I don't know how much was his fault, and I'm not convinced it was well-handled by the club. He had connections in Spain, and had brought in Michu and other Spanish players. This may have led to a cliquish feel to the team. But that's done, most of those players are gone, and long-time Swan Garry Monk is now the youngest manager in the PL.

We seem to have done pretty well in replacing the players who left. Always hard to say this early. We need to make a few more moves before the transfer window closes, but that first game was a hell of a start, anyway.

Dylan Thomas came from Swansea....so did Badfinger...and Swansea Jack, a dog that rescued people from drowning. I read about the dog as a kid, and between him, Thomas, and Pete Ham from Badfinger, I had enough of my own stupid justifications to pick them as my team a few years back.

Now I'll never stop being a Swansea fan. I hope you'll stick around too.

But in the future Brazil might be more important. It sided with Argentina in the war, so the US might see it as an opportunity to affirm some sort of dominance or control over the region. Its financial system already has a pretty strong hold over Argentina and the region has interests in energy.

Now no-one is hiding scientific evidence to stop them being offended as they are not the same as other people, they may have defects which mean that in terms of evolution they may be a way backwards. Yet no-one (certainly not myself) feels that we need to base our social policies to counter this ""reverse evolution"" as we're social animals, that have used our social structures to overcome huge biological differences and instincts in order to make our societies more welcoming (not the right word). Any minimal biological differences between races would not be something we base our social policies off, because we can and have overcome our evolutionary requirements in so many aspects, the idea of a minor biological difference being something we change our lives over is laughable to me.

&gt;

&gt;___TV Offal___ was a British television comedy sketch/archive series that ran on [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4), from October 1997 to June 1998. It was written and narrated by comedian and writer [Victor Lewis-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lewis-Smith), who shared writing duties with [Paul Sparks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sparks). It ran for only seven episodes (including the pilot), and is probably best known for first airing the [uncensored Rainbow sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_(TV_series\)#The_.22adult.22_version) on national television, as well as the ""Gay Daleks"" sketches.

&gt;The series covered generally obscure, rare or offensive excerpts of television footage from numerous media archives, usually accompanied by Lewis-Smith's biting commentary and cynical approach to what was being shown. Lewis-Smith used a variety of categories on the show to accompany a particular selection of programme footage. The show was also characterised by its musical score of campy [jingles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jingle) introducing the regular segments. These were produced in the 1980s style by the [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas)-based radio ID company [JAM Creative Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAM_Creative_Productions).

&gt;The programme was made by [Associated-Rediffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated-Rediffusion), the name of a TV company formerly serving the London area from 1955 to 1964 (and continuing as *Rediffusion, London* until 1968). Lewis-Smith bought the name for his own production company when he discovered that it was dormant.[(http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/tvoffal_66602210.shtml)

In any case there is a set of content that fans largely believe or do not believe regardless of what those on high say (Memory Alpha). Many Star Trek fans consider the Animated Series to be canon albeit it can probably never be made official again.

This is why I said there is an ""unofficial"" Doctor Who canon. There is no creator defined canon but in terms of the larger fandom there is a currents of belief at what constitutes the most relevant and respected content which cannot really be ignored when discussing things with other fans.

So it really comes down to semantics. I choose to call this hierarchy of content an unofficial canon and you do not.

My general advice for first years is thus:

Don't drink. Okay - drink, but please, even if you're being hazed by a society (despite the banning of such acts) please look after yourself. A fortnight after I moved into my tower, some first year got WAAAY too drunk and ended up dead in the stairwell of my building. Just two weeks after leaving his parents. Please PLEASE look after yourselves.

Plan your meals. Pre-planning, and even shopping online will prevent you impulse buying and will help you really stay on top of your finances. Structure is a great habit to pick up, and it only takes something like 66 repetitions for an action to become habit - you could be a perfectly functioning human being in less than the first term!

Fucking wash up immediately. I mean seriously - if you clean as you cook, wash after you eat, not only is it easier because it isn't all dried and stuck to everything - but you're not being inconsiderate to everyone that has to be near Mt. Dirty-dishes. It stinks, and makes living with 15 other people a chore (south towers! yay!)

Smoking - please pay attention to where you smoke, it is illegal to smoke inside, and you are not permitted to smoke in any of the covered areas on campus (despite people still doing so...) as it's either an area where people eat, or it's near where people work, and the smoke invades through the windows. So it's either illegal or inconsiderate - choose.

Don't walk alone. If you leave campus - please stay in groups, especially at night. We've had a couple of murders recently, one of which was a student and it happened fairly near campus - you can get a free personal alarm from the security/information desk. Stay safe.

Usually around Freshers - when it's mad in the squares - we get to hear than the Santander bank ATM has had a card skimmer/fraud device put on it - please be vigilant.

**protips - now I'm done with the doom and gloom stuff**

If 4 or more of you are going to town - split a cab both ways. Way more convenient - and cheaper.

Orange Wednesdays - if you're not a UK citizen, you may not have heard of these. Worth picking up a cheap phone and sim for alone.

Waterstone's is convenient - but hugely expensive. You (obviously) can save money shopping around.

Re-Cycle, we have a bike repair/recycling service on campus most Wednesdays - they're really cool guys and you can get some excellent bikes from them for really good money.

Happy Days - don't overdo it there (i.e. eat it rarely) and you'll never understand why the masses call it ""crappy days"" - I still really enjoy it.

Societies - Try everything in freshers. Go to the sports socs everyday whilst it's free. You'll meet cool people even if you go just once, and it's nice to get to try stuff without having to pay!

Frontrunners - I cannot stress this one enough. Apply for a frontrunner position. I was working for the university about 5weeks after I arrived - I'm still doing that same job (albeit after a tasty pay-rise) &gt;4 months after I graduated. Do it because if nothing else it gets you more beer tokens and looks good on the CV to have worked and studied at the same time.

true,AlphaShotZ,null,null,"There's a difference between having respect for players and being naive. Lampard and Cole are modern day legends of Chelsea football club, it is therefore right that we let them leave with the utmost dignity. They are not capable of playing for us at the highest level anymore. Cech is only different in this category because he can still play at the highest level, but we have better talent which he and many others will understand is necessary to keep the club moving forward.

Mata did not fit our system of play and he left with our respect and good wishes. De Bruyne and Lukaku were not willing to challenge for their spots, and on the rare occasion they actually did play, they underperformed massively.

*Ba is the only exception* to the criteria above, and I regret that he wasn't played more.

What you seem to confuse is that clubs don't and can't operate with the medium of focusing on respect, and yet **you have massive double standards**. If we keep the likes of Cole, Lampard and Cech, we can't blood the next generation like Lukaku and De Bruyne. And then you go and moan about the fact we didn't play them. If we choose to get rid of the likes of Cole, Lampard and Cech in favour of blooding new talent, then you moan about us not respecting our legends.

Secondly, I'm sorry that as fans of Chelsea, we don't continue to praise and discuss the likes of Lukaku, Mata and De Bruyne. ( /s ) This subreddit is reasonable, and will praise those who deserve it, but as we're fans of the club, and of it's current players, we are going to be slightly biased when discussing current players over former ones.


TL;DR: We're here to **respect our past, not focus on it**. Players come and players leave, that's what makes football so exciting, and why we love the sport. But I really can't be arsed to deal with fans who can't get over the fact that football is not solely about emotion, it's about progress. Otherwise we get left behind, and that's the last thing I want to see happen to Chelsea. **We move forward, we survive, we thrive**. Otherwise we get caught up in what was, rather than what can be.

true,pharelljordan,lfcflame,,"What are you talking about mate? Lucas was extremely solid in the first half, he has fitness issues but is a great asset, Stevie wasn't playing too well too if we are judging Lucas for what happened against Southampton. 

I really don't get where this Lucas hate comes from, the guy is quality, he plays the DM role well, against Southampton we were being overwhelmed in the midfield because we were playing with 2 DMs. With that you need push out for a high defensive line, and Skrtel is useless in that, he keeps dropping deep, inviting pressure and drags the whole defence with him, that's what was happening last year, he really needs to improve that aspect of the game. 

Lucas has now become the scapegoat of everything bad that happens with us. Look at our back line when Southampton scored their [first goal](https://mediacru.sh/Fr7ypoUST3EO), Also look at Skrtel he is just aimlessly standing around, doesn't even notice Clyne, till it's too late. So blaming Lucas for what was a piss poor defensive performance by Skrtel, Lovren and Johnson is hardly the right thing to do IMO.

Edit: Also Lucas was taken off because Gerrard is a better distributor and Brendao wanted to change the shape, so it became a diamond, Gerrard had both Hendo and Allen in front of him, so we were not being overwhelmed anymore. Also there is a glaring problem with our backline, specifically Skrtel, he drops too deep, as I may have mentioned, Lovren needs to tell him stay up or we may be seeing a Lovren, Sakho partnership, possibly even Agger.",0,1408408017,null,0,false,0,cju3a49,t3_2dxd09,t1_cju3a49,t1_cju0dgx,null,1435310055,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;What are you talking about mate? Lucas was extremely solid in the first half, he has fitness issues but is a great asset, Stevie wasn't playing too well too if we are judging Lucas for what happened against Southampton. 
I agree Gerrard didn't play well but Lucas should have played much better than he did considering Allen and Can were sitting on the bench.

&gt;I really don't get where this Lucas hate comes from, the guy is quality, he plays the DM role well, against Southampton we were being overwhelmed in the midfield because we were playing with 2 DMs. With that you need push out for a high defensive line, and Skrtel is useless in that, he keeps dropping deep, inviting pressure and drags the whole defence with him, that's what was happening last year, he really needs to improve that aspect of the game. 

I don't think hes quick enough or a good enough passer to do the DM role to the standard we need. Yeah I think we need to play Lovren with Sakho as Skrtel invites too much pressure and relies on last ditch tackles to save his skin.

&gt;Lucas has now become the scapegoat of everything bad that happens with us. Look at our back line when Southampton scored their [first goal](https://mediacru.sh/Fr7ypoUST3EO), Also look at Skrtel he is just aimlessly standing around, doesn't even notice Clyne, till it's too late. So blaming Lucas for what was a piss poor defensive performance by Skrtel, Lovren and Johnson is hardly the right thing to do IMO.

The backline is poor but Lucas and Skrtel need to share responsibility for that goal, Lovren had a solid game and can't be blamed for Tadic making an excellent pass there and Johnson actually had a good game in my opinion.

I completely agree with you about Skrtel, but I think if we want Champions League football again next season we should only play Lucas as a last resort

I mean I think you'll get ""snobby"" people wherever you go and you may well find more at UoB than Aston, but at the end of the day they're a small minority and I think you'll fit in whatever your circumstance.

I can't speak for the course difficulty either, having obviously not experienced Aston's economics course, but in my experience UoB's got a bit tricky with the mathematics in 2nd year, but many of the lecturers really know what they're talking about and if you have a real interest in the subject, I can definitely recommend UoB.

Regarding the CV, in my personal opinion if you're looking for a career job, particularly in the City then yes, unfortunately I think UoB over Aston will matter. And I'm not saying that to be negative in any way towards Aston's teaching/facilities/etc. I have a fair number of friends who have gone to Aston and have heard nothing but good things. But those who are interviewing you (outside of HR) have probably graduated back when Aston had just achieved University status and added to the fact that UoB is a ""redbrick"" uni, may put a UoB grad before an Aston one. They shouldn't, and I'm a strong supporter of judging the person, not what's on their CV, but in my experience it happens, particularly with international companies.

What I would put over all of that though is the life experiences I've gained from University.

Yet, Lucas was lambasted for this ""mistake"" and labeled as being awful throughout the game when he was very solid in his job. 

It is Skrtel's primary task to close down those spaces and make sure him and Lovren are in close distance to one and other. If Skrtel does his job, that goal is not happening. Lucas is doing his job. He gets close to Tadic to make sure he is helping Lovren, something Skrtel is not doing. Lucas cannot follow Clyne into the box and help Lovren out at the same time. He has to choose one or the other. Whereas Skrtel has one job in that instance and that is to follow Lovren soon as he goes. If anything Skrtel is ball watching, because he's not paying attention to his CB partner and as a result opens up huge amounts of space in the box... 

Yet Lucas gets shit on for being slow and ""ball-watching"". Soon as Tadic plays that ball (the only part where Lucas isn't actually moving) its already too late for Lucas to do anything. For some reason, according to majority of people on this sub, Lucas had to cover that space that Skrtel left 2 seconds before Tadic plays the ball to effectively ""track Clyne's run"".

&gt;Hello everybody! I'm sure I might strike a few chords in saying that I can't wait for Saturday, but to tide myself over, I made this Rainmeter theme to celebrate the past doctors before the new one arrives!

&gt;Because I'm so indecisive, I couldn't decide which I liked better, the ""busy"" theme with all of the date and music player, or the ""quiet"" theme with just the icons and clock. Anyway, I also included the Adobe icons in black and white in there too because I thought they looked cool.

&gt;Here are the skins I used:

&gt;* [Tonxico Suite](http://tonxico.deviantart.com/art/Tonxico-Suite-1-1-289345281) for the icons

&gt;* [Elegance 2](http://lilshizzy.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Elegance-2-244373054) for the date and time

&gt;* [Enigma](http://enigma.kaelri.com/downloads/) for the music player and volume

&gt;* [Analog](http://rainmeterhub.com/skins/aclock/) for the clock 

&gt;Also, if you are DYING for the wallpaper and icon image files, 

&gt;* [Here](http://imgur.com/a/wxdFM) is all the icons

&gt;* [Here](http://imgur.com/a/wxdFM) is the wallpaper

Schneiderlin and Wanyama did a great job of keeping Coutinho in check, and playing further forward, Coutinho didn't show the same defensive intensity that we know he is capable of.

I still think that Lucas can be an asset to the team, though. He's got experience, and with Can still a relative unknown, Lucas is the closest thing we have to a designated DM.

The engineering part of the IRA was extraordinary. They were making or preparing to make things in the 90's that to this day haven't been replicated. Of the top of my head they made: 

- A rocket launcher that unlike others could fire within small spaces without injury to the person firing it. The PRIG or Projected Improvised Explosive Grenade I think is what it was called. 
- Bombs and mortars that could be detonated by torches. A light sensor would be placed at the bomb or mortar. Whenever a patrol would pass by the Volunteer in a car would shine a torch at the sensor and drive off, detonating the explosive. 
- Bombs and mortars detonated by speed guns Same idea as the torch. Sensor at the bomb, guy in a car. Patrol passes by and he aims the speed gun at the bomb.
- GPS guided car bombs and Fuel air bombs were being developped but never made due to the ceasefire.

These examples and many other weapons made before these show a level of sophistication that hasn't been paralleled since. Their weapon making could be far from rag-tag. However a lot of other things they did was. Most Volunteers weren't very well trained. A lot of operations were pretty much pot shots (the video shows these two points). Executions of operations commonly went wrong; just look at the number of civilians killed by accident. Security clearly wasn't very good. Nearly everything that was done in the IRA was known by the security forces. Many of the guns used weren't terribly good either. 

I'll find the sources for their technologies in the morning once I'm off my phone.

Although I also think attitude plays a big part in it.

Remember, money is more like a field than a particle. It is not possible to distinguish one £1 from another on a macroscale. The value of the money in your pocket or bank is smeared out across not just space but also time.

Its early days... but Chelsea do look strong. Mourinho knows what he is doing. Fabregas, Hazard, Costa, Courtois, Oscar all looked the money they are worth. But they played burnley.

Man City have class even though they look like they have a world cup / last season hangover. 

Arsenal will do shit all as always. They have a first class midfield and no one decent to slot the ball in. They pass pass pass pass pass and nothing. They were very lucky. Also Sanchez didnt handle the premier league speed in shutting down. He looked rusty but will come good.

Man Utd have alot of injuries. It will take time for them to learn the Van Gaal system. I think they will push for 4th place at times in the season but ultimately fall short. The biggest thing against Man Utd is that if they fail this season to qualify for champions league they are gonna struggle to get players to sign for them. Van Persie is 31. He's past his prime and really should be playing as a backup. Rooney is 28. These are his last years before he his past his prime. They will need a complete new team soon. And if they fail next season at champions league qualification then they lose sponsorship and money. We could be seeing the beginning of the dark ages for Man Utd. Here's hoping!

Liverpool. We got three points. It was rough. People have already written us off competing for the title some even saying we won't get top 4. But we have sturridge who knocked in 20 and has a better average over his first 50 games than Torres or Suarez. We also have Sterling who just two years ago was where Ibe is now. Just on the outskirts of the first team. But now look at him. He has the potential to score 15-20 goals this season. AND we still have Lallana and Markovic (40+ million worth) to come into the team.

Everton will be in the top 8. They have a good RETURNING team. Good coach and will get even stronger throughout the season.

As much as I wish this was true the majority of their sponsorship deals are on long term contracts. They just signed a new kit deal with Adidas, which they may lose a proportion of the money but I imagine it would be quite lucrative

The rest is pretty much spot on

true,Azzah,,Kieran Richardson is Craig Charles in disguise,"For the lazy/blocked at work:

""Aston Villa have bagged some relatively high-profile signings this summer and, if Joe Cole, Kieran Richardson and Philippe Senderos perform at their best, and Carlos Sánchez can adapt quickly to English football after impressing for Colombia in the World Cup, then with Christian Benteke to come back from injury in October, they may just be comfortable this season as the search for new owners is stepped up. But just as important as the new players might be the addition of Roy Keane in the dugout. Rarely can an assistant manager have had his name chanted as Keane’s was at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday as Villa deservedly won 1-0 thanks to a wholehearted and disciplined performance. It is ironic as Villa seek to stop the rot that started with Martin O’Neill’s departure four years ago, two of his protégés are leading the challenge: Paul Lambert, his captain at Celtic, and Keane, now his assistant with Ireland.

Lambert seems to be troubled by very little ego so will not mind if Keane’s name is chanted as long as Villa are winning. He paid full tribute to his new right-hand man’s pedigree after a victory that bore many of the hallmarks that made Keane the warrior he was as a player. “He’s been brilliant for us,” Lambert said. “Anybody who’s seen him play a game of football knows how much he wants to win. The game’s all about winning; the more games you win, the better you become.”

Referees will not give 50/50 decisions against Villa lightly. Every one that went Stoke’s way on Saturday – and there were a few 40/60s as well – Lambert, no shrinking violet himself, and Keane were out into their technical area (what a misnomer that is, by the way – it is more a shouting cage), asking Anthony Taylor to think carefully about repeating such folly. Then the fourth official would get a glare for good measure on their way back.

Keane seems to be the kind of character who can help return fire to Villa’s bellies. And surely, working alongside O’Neill for a while now, on the TV gantry then the international arena, he will have learned when to bark and when to bite his tongue compared with the young manager who promised so much at Sunderland before failing at Ipswich Town. No one will bully Villa lightly. Their players made sure of that on the field and Keane followed suit from the touchline. When Mark Hughes attempted to shout Weimann to get off the field more quickly as the Villa matchwinner was substituted, Keane simply laughed at his former Manchester United team-mate. You can imagine him asking whether Hughes would have hurried off if he was winning. When the Stoke manager was asked what their banter had entailed, Hughes replied: “I was having a go at his player, not at Roy – I’m not that daft!” Villa fans will take pride from this refusal to lie down without a fight and it could come in handy in the challenging months ahead in what is certain to be a transitional season.

That's not true. Israel [did not agree to fully lift the blockade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense#Ceasefire_of_21_November); they agreed to open some border crossings -- which they did indeed open, until numerous rockets were fired from Gaza, breaking the ceasefire. Perhaps you should take your own advice on Googling.

&gt; Israel didn't lift the siege. A siege that was a completely illegal collective punishment, and which restricted the import into Gaza of medicines needed by pregnant women to ensure healthy children.

Can you think of [any other reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel) why Israel might be blockading Gaza, besides the malicious desire to hurt pregnant women?",0,1408427730,null,0,false,0,cjubzqk,t3_2dvmtd,t1_cjubzqk,t1_cjtyz36,null,1435449519,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There were 4 mistakes that led to this goal:

Lovren should start closer to Johnson. Skrtel should cover the gap when Lovren moves.
Lucas should track Clyne
Sterling should show Clyne outside, not inside.

I'm going to rest most of the blame on Sterling/ Lovren. It is absolute basic defence to show attackers the outside, which Sterling fails to do. Lovren has time to get organised but fails to get closer to Johnson. If he feels Johnson is too wide he should call him inwards at that point.

The other 2 mistakes are culpable but essentially because 2 players lost concentration, this happens from time to time. They were failed reactive actions,(cures) but Sterling and Lovren failed on their proactive actions (prevention). And we all know prevention is better than cure.

true,tombsar,Queens,Queens',"1) I didn't do a lot of specific preparation for the interview, apart from reading some of the books from the reading list (new science of strong materials, understanding the world by the way it comes apart, how stuff works, etc). One thing I found very useful was doing a practice paper for the Thinking Skills Assessment, which is available online. (Not sure if they still do the TSA, though).

2) I was given a series of written questions, which I had to solve while talking through my working. There was a simple circuits question (calculate voltage across this component), a fluids question (derive an expression for something falling through oil), a differentiation question (solve for equations of motion after working out forces), and probably a few more I have forgotten. Apart from the circuits question, I needed a bit of prompting to get to the end of all of them; that is expected. However, once I had solved the question on paper, they then asked me additional questions about how to interpret the answers, e.g. given the equation of motion, how would it affect the driver while turning? What would happen if the oil density went to zero, or infinity? Be aware that solving equations is not enough; you have to be able to think about how they apply to the real world.

3) I would actually reccommend reading up on the third year course, since that is the point at which you have to choose all of your modules. It is fine to say you haven't chosen a specialism yet (that is what the first two years are for), but maybe pick a couple of courses you like the look of; it shows you are interested in the course, not just on getting in to Cambridge. My interviewer happened to lecture on a topic I was really interested in, and we spent the last 5 mins of the interview talking about it.

The interview is for them to decide if you are someone they think they could teach, not to see if you know everything already. If you get stuck on anything, just be honest and ask for help.

There will also be much more multi-use for concerts and other sports events etc which might detract the Spursness of the venue.

I am simply pointing out the bias on this sub. Both of these stories happened yesterday, but only the UKIP story is being reported on. 

People are claiming that UKIP is a racist, sexist, homophobic party, well if you only read stories about UKIP members doing these things, and ignore it when the other parties do, of course you are going to form that view, but it will be a poorly informed view.

Also, I don't think all the parties are as bad as each other. What the Labour MP said was clearly worse than what the UKIP MEP said. 

While what the UKIP MEP said was stupid and could definitely cause offence, the words she used don't actually mean anything.

What the Labour MP said:

&gt;female MPs would make the Commons ""less exciting"" and preoccupied with ""family issues"" and ""small problems rather than big ideas"".

Which is hugely offensive to all women, totally derogatory and dismissive. It would be hard to argue that what the UKIP MEP said was anywhere near as bad, and yet it is the only one of the two stories we are discussing. The reason for that is obvious, UKIP saying something silly like this fits into the narrative that people have for UKIP, a labour MP saying this does not.

&gt;Dividend income (from shares) is treated differently;

I'm missing it because I've already posted a source showing its untrue.

* I think the rating for Lucas is a bit harsh, but I don't think he played well. He could have been better defensively and when going forward he didn't really bring much (he always seemed in a rush to get rid of the ball). 
* Sturridge was also not at his best throughout the game and the only saving factor was his tap in. 
* I'd say our weakest link was again Johnson who apparently decided to become a striker (got to break that 2 year goal drought). His shots were well off and every time he got the ball he passed it back to our defense. 
* Not our best performance, but we still managed to pick up an important 2:1 win, which is good sign.All in all this is still the first game of the season, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on our boys.

Again, what policies?

&gt;They benefit white middle class people.

What do you mean by this? As far as I know UKIP has never stated that as one of their reasons any of their policies, so why did you say this? Do you actually believe that 'zero tolerance' and 'multiculturalism rollback' will make life easier for white people?

&gt;Besides, even if the other three think it, they sure as hell aren't saying it.

You've hit the nail on the head there. There are so many things that happen behind closed doors with the main parties, so many goals and beliefs which are kept hidden from the public. Did Labour encourage large scale immigration to improve their election results, is the Tories end game to completely privatise the NHS? Nothing would surprise the public any more because they expect to be lied to.

People respond well to UKIP because whether you agree with them or not, they are honest. They believe immigration is too high, and needs to be controlled, and for that you vilify them. Well so what? so do the Tories, they just aren't as open about it. They believe that big businesses are important and should get more support, and some should be protected at all costs, well so do all of the main parties, but they won't openly say it as much because it doesn't go over well with the public. I'd rather have a party that was honest about what it was and allowed me to make my own mind up about them.

 You complain when politicians conceal the truth from you, yet as soon as an honest party emerges you literally treat them like the Nazis. 

I know exactly how many idiots are in UKIP, the party you support could be full of them (and probably is) and you would never know. Just look at how long Austin Mitchell got away with it. I know exactly who I'm voting for, you cannot say the same. 

&gt;why would they even imply they were dodging tax, or sending money home? Why would they matter?

Because it is unfair on everyone else who has to pay tax, and who has to support a family in this country, but cannot, because they are being undercut by workers sharing the rent on a 3 bed house between 8, and supporting a family in Romania where the cost of living is much lower.  

&gt;What if four or five white middle class women lived in one house? Should we be afraid they'd keep us up all night because of key parties? Poisoning ex-husbands?

Clearly you have never worked in the building and maintenance trades, or know anyone who has. Why don't you go ask someone who does how difficult finding work and supporting their families has become,  before making such dismissive statements, then maybe you can have a little bit of empathy for them. 

&gt;He's  implying Romanians are fucking dangerous and scary to a society such as Britain that usually just lives in small family groups which is pretty uncommon in the world. It's ignorant and racist.

It's not ignorant and racists to say that Romanians are [arrested](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9896121/Up-to-one-in-three-Romanians-arrested-figures-show.html) in this country more than almost any other minority group. Especially shocking considering the relatively small number of them that live here legally. And that if there is a group of them living in a small house together, and thereby breaking the law, it might not be something that families want to live next door to. You can argue that point all you like, but would you buy a house next door to a set-up like that? I doubt it. 

If it was a Romanian family he was talking about it would be a different matter. But he was specifically talking about a group of Romanian men, breaking the law, and making life harder for others. Anyone who believes in a fair and equal society should agree that that sort of criminal behaviour should not be tolerated.

What are you going to be studying at Queens and how long will you be over here for? Queens is a great uni and has loads of different clubs &amp; societies so you are bound to get into something you like and meet people! 

There are loads of things to do outdoors here. Football (soccer) and rugby are big sports, but there's everything from cliff jumping, surfing, fishing, zorbing, hill walking, climbing, golf, airsoft take your pick! I hear there's also a bit of marching from time to time! (Not my cup of tea but probably worth a visit as a tourist)

For accommodation you should look at some of the oremau road, botanic and stranmillis as people have suggested. Keep clear of the holy lands and probably the ""village"" on the lisburn road. If you are looking at places and want a local persons view drop me a pm and I'll give you an honest view if that helps at all. 

As for bars, take your pick. There's a load of bars here, far more than clubs. For live music nights to comedy nights, we do have a good selection. The recommendations above are pretty spot on, only other places I would give a go would be Bert's Jazz bar (bit more expensive but great music) and the John Hewitt if it hasn't already been mentioned.

Again, if you get over here and want to grab a pint or a coffee (having a two year old this is now my go to beverage - my clubbing days are also over) I'll be happy to meet up. I'll also bring a friend or two and you can ask any questions or shoot the shit in a chilled environment. Again, just PM.

Hope this helps.

Additionally, as much as I love White Hart Lane, it's hard to argue that it's a little dated and dingy in places when compared to other stadiums (even Coventry's Ricoh stadium is 'cleaner'). 

A new stadium makes most sense when trying to compete with rivals, and additionally if trying to attract new fans. Which stadium looks more appealing you would have to ask between Emirates and White Hart Lane, and although ours still looks like the classic stadium, I would guess it may fail to attract those looking for a one off game.

&gt;Capital Gains Tax

&gt;  Capital gains tax is charged at 18% if you are a basic rate taxpayer and 28% if you are a higher rate taxpayer.

&gt;Which would both seem in invalidate your main point.

Yes, I thought that when I read it, but then you are not taking into account the fact that you don't pay tax on the first 22k of that income (if you use the wife allowance) and you can also defer payments to push any payments into the next year. Now I grant you that this is small potatoes around this level and we are only talking about an advantage in the thousands of pounds sort of area which doesn't sound like much if you are rich, however if you only earn £24k a year you don't get any of these advantages and even 28% CGT is less than what your average worker pays with tax + NI.

Getting away from the income taxes, what bout the regressive taxes, you have been totally silent on that topic and you will note that the article I linked did say that the flax tax system was a result of regressive taxes.

After doing more research it does seem the coalition (of all people eh!) has done a bit more to even things out in the progressive tax area in terms of CGT and things like that (lower allowance for CGT and higher personal alloance for income tax, 28% band was brought in in 2010 etc).

true,kugrian,null,null,"Home Office minister Norman Baker called last week for medicinal cannabis to be legalised. This is the inside story of a campaign that began in 1999, started to gain real traction in 2011 and may finally come to fruition in 2014.

The last British politician to have the courage to follow the evidence on drugs policy and introduce radical reform was Margaret Thatcher.  Now Norman Baker isn’t normally in the same category as Thatcher but they have both demonstrated courage in the face of opposition from their colleagues and widespread bigotry and ignorance throughout parliament and Whitehall.

Tory cabinet members in 1986 must have been spluttering into their claret and very large whiskies when they heard that Margaret was insisting on introducing clean needle exchange for injecting drug users. She was absolutely right to do so and her action saved thousands of lives. Many other countries followed her lead and it slowed the spread of HIV dramatically.

Of course, Margaret Thatcher was that very rare thing amongst leading politicians – a scientist.  She knew the value of evidence and that even when it was pointing in an uncomfortable direction, that was the right way to go.

Norman Baker’s call this week follows exactly the same logic.  All he has suggested is that drugs policy should follow the evidence and it says much about the quality and intelligence of other MPs that his idea is controversial.  Most MPs and ministers follow a drugs policy that is created out of fear of what the Daily Mail might say.  Then they’re straight off to one of the taxpayer-subsidised bars in the Palace of Westminster to consume vast quantities of the most dangerous and damaging drug of all at knock down prices.

Norman Baker said:

“I’ve seen in my capacity as drugs minister many credible individuals who tell me that they have medical conditions that traditional forms of treatment do not help, conditions that are relieved by cannabis.

It’s wrong that the government should prevent people having access to something that will help their health and doubly wrong that the government criminalises them.

I want to see cannabis more widely used in the same way drugs like morphine are.

Morphine is illegal for recreational use but legal for medicinal and cannabis should be the same – controlled by the NHS under strict conditions.”

 So what brought Norman to this conclusion?  Shortly after his appointment as a minister earlier this year he was still saying that the evidence for the medicinal benefits of cannabis was “limited“.  What changed his mind?

CLEAR was founded back in 1999.  We were called the Legalise Cannabis Alliance then and, as remains the case today, our primary aim was to end the prohibition of cannabis for all purposes.  Medicinal use though, has always been a priority.  Fast forward to last month, July 2014, and the inter-departmental conference, chaired by Norman Baker, that led to his call for legal medicinal cannabis, I explained why it is a move that must be made without further delay.

I was accompanied by a delegation from the CLEAR Medicinal Cannabis Users Panel. I opened our presentation to Mr Baker and a phalanx of officials from the Home Office and Department of Health by saying:

“It may be an injustice that I, as an adult in the privacy of my own home, am not allowed to grow a few cannabis plants and consume them as I wish.  For these people though, who otherwise are trapped in a world of pain, suffering and disability, it’s not an injustice,  it’s an obscenity”

The Legalise Cannabis Alliance followed a path that everyone believed was right.  Marches and demos were held throughout the country, candidates were fielded in local and general elections.  In 2003, then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, downgraded cannabis to a class C drug.  This was widely seen as effective decriminalisation and campaigners confidently expected that it wouldn’t be long until the last vestiges of prohibition were swept away and full legalisation would become a reality.  How wrong we were.  The malevolent and corrupt Paul Dacre, ‘capo di tutti capi’ of the Fleet Street Mafia, twisted Gordon Brown’s arm behind his back and as 2009 dawned cannabis was upgraded back to class B.

This is not the occasion to review that mistake again but suffice to say that all the evidence of consumption, arrests, hospital admissions and use by children proved it to be disastrous. It increased harms and problems around cannabis, accelerated the rush of organised crime into cannabis farms and the prevalence of high THC, low CBD ‘moonshine’ weed.

In 2011, with membership in the doldrums and literally nothing happening in the campaign anywhere in the UK, we relaunched as CLEAR.  We dropped the word ‘legalise‘ because it’s widely misunderstood and almost always results in some tabloid hack or washed up radio host making jokes about ‘buying crack in Tescos’.

Of course, what we really advocate is more control, not less.  We have none at the moment because in their idiocy, successive governments have chosen to abandon our children, our communities and the £6 billion cannabis market to criminals.  A properly regulated system would enforce age limits, quality and labelling standards, do away with street dealers and dangerous hidden cannabis farms which often cause fires. Instead we’d have thousands of new jobs and a rational, responsible approach to a market that is not about to disappear just because bigoted and ignorant politicians want it to.

For the first time , our new constitution, adopted by a two thirds majority of members, enshrined medicinal use as our top priority.  Promoting reform for those who need cannabis as medicine accounts for at least three quarters of our time and resources.

Our strategy has been to try and incorporate medicinal cannabis into the established procedures, rules and regulations that underpin all medicine and healthcare in the UK. It is probably not yet viable to advance the argument for home cultivation for medicinal use.  That will come in due course, once the efficacy and safety of cannabis is more widely understood.  To begin with we argue that doctors should be able to prescribe cannabis.  This is the first step in regulating the entire cannabis market.  It is difficult for even the most hardened and cruel prohibitionist to argue against a doctor’s judgement.  If a doctor uses his or her professional expertise to decide that cannabis is what a patient needs, then how can some politician, journalist or civil servant stand against it?

Aside from the prohibitively expensive Sativex, the only prescribable form of medicinal cannabis is the Bedrocan range.  Regulated by the Dutch government’s Bureau voor Medicinale Cannabis, it is grown to the very highest standards, irradiated to destroy any mould or bacteria and available in differing ratios of THC:CBD. Recently introduced new products offer an indica variety and a low THC, high CBD option.

Over the last three and a half years we have campaigned for doctors to prescribe Bedrocan products. We formed the CLEAR Medicinal Cannabis Users Panel and dozens of brave people with the most debilitating conditions have stepped up to give testimony, to approach their doctors and their MPs for support.  Several members of the panel have successfully obtained prescriptions from their doctor, some GPs but also consultants in pain management and rehabilitation medicine. In each instance we have applied to the Home Office for an import licence to bring in the Bedrocan from a Dutch pharmacy.

Without exception, the Home Office has been difficult and obstructive about every licence application. It is remarkable how many have been ‘lost’.  Not one has been responded to in a timely fashion.  In the end they have all been rejected.

Simultaneously, armed with their prescriptions, seven CLEAR members have travelled to Holland, had their prescriptions filled at a Dutch pharmacy and returned to the UK, declaring their medicine at customs.  In all but one instance they have been waved through with the prescription satisfying the Border Force officers that they were legitimate.  One fortunate individual has now successfully completed half a dozen trips and the officers at his port of entry are familiar with his credentials.

For all intents and purposes these few people have legally obtained their cannabis.  Any prosecution against them would have been bound to fail  but this is still not a solution for the thousands more who need access to medicinal cannabis.

Through this process we have found fantastic support from Andrew Turner, MP for the Isle of Wight. Although opposed to wider legalisation, he is convinced that his constituents who have been prescribed Bedrocan should have access to it. In particular, George Hutchings has been our point man in this effort.  Ironically and cruelly, it was George who had his medicine seized by the Border Force at Southampton Airport.  Stricken with Charcot Marie Tooth disease, his consultant had prescribed him the Bedrocan product Bedrobinol and even wrote to the Border Force requesting that they return it to him.

George is an extraordinary individual, even more so considering the uncertain future he faces with a neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure.  George has been brave and strong enough to work with us as we searched for and eventually found a top tier firm of solicitors, Bindmans, who took on his case on legal aid.  They retained the services of Ben Cooper from Doughty Street Chambers, the go to barrister on all matters relating to cannabis.  Together, George’s legal advisers have tested the law to its very limits from every angle and with creative, open minds.

The result is not positive.  In fact, we have discovered little known legislation, carried by ministerial order, which places cannabis under further restriction, even beyond its class B and schedule 1 status. We now know that it is actually unlawful for a doctor to prescribe cannabis as specific legislation prohibits it.

Very shortly, we will be publishing documents from Bindmans and Ben Cooper which amount to the definitive legal advice on medical cannabis.  There is no opportunity for judicial review or other challenge to the current regime but there are new possible lines of defence for anyone facing criminal charges.

It is with the support of  George’s MP, Andrew Turner, that we have made real progress though.  Mr Turner and his office have tirelessly lobbied the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Home Affairs Select Committee. In February, we met with Keith Vaz MP, chair of the committee. He agreed that he would work with Julian Huppert MP, another committee member to hold an inquiry into the subject.  He also said that he would write to Norman Baker, the new drugs minister, urging him to meet with us.

When the call came, it was out of the blue. I took Nick Ellis, Vicky Hodgson and Lara Smith to the inter-departmental conference and it was clear that their stories touched Mr Baker.  I shall never forget the reaction when Nick produced a syringe full of CBD oil and explained that it was only because of it that he was able to cope with travelling to the meeting. Also, the passionate and convincing testimony of Vicky, describing how cannabis is the only thing that helps with her agonising cluster headaches. And Lara, moved to a few discreet tears as she explained the intimate details of how her condition affects her life and how it is cannabis that enables her to maintain a family life with her three school age children and hardworking husband.

So Norman Baker acted and he acted fast. He had also met with a couple of constituents, also medicinal users, Clark French with MS and Keiron Reeves with epilepsy.

I cannot think of another example, in any policy area, where a government minister has come out so boldly and directly for a radical change in current policy.  It is beyond irony that a minister can make such a statement and then an ‘official government spokesperson’ can directly contradict him.  This says worrying things about so-called democracy in the UK but cannot detract from the importance of Mr Baker’s words.

This may not quite be a breakthrough.  Unsurprisingly, the usual bigots and bullies and ignoramuses have attacked what is actually a mission of mercy.  The Daily Telegraph and The Times have simply ignored it because it doesn’t suit their agenda but The Sun and The Daily Mail have reported it.

I pay tribute to Norman Baker and also to all those who have worked with us on this campaign.  We’re not quite there yet but we will be soon.",0,1408441629,null,0,false,0,cjuf6de,t3_2dythe,t1_cjuf6de,t1_cjuf675,null,1435315511,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Actual Dislike: Reactionary support has to be up there.

Additional Dislike: I don't like the fact that the people who run the club are seemingly clueless about big business. We have an amazing footballing backroom, but a woeful business one. Ask any fan and he will list ten massive business errors Bill and the gang have made over the last decade, and it is this that has cost us our chance of top 4. 

From Finch Farm to Dan Gosling (newer fans can google), we have been cost tens of millions because of incompetence at the top. Bill is a theater producer, and I am pretty sure there is no other theater producer that is Chairman of a business with a £100m annual turnover. If you compare our figures to someone like Stoke, a far smaller club- it is shocking. They make a fortune on sponsors and endorsements, so can spend money on players...

I think they may set up in a similar way against us they are away from home so will be trying to nick a win or get a solid draw.  I can't imagine them attacking in a gung-ho style.  

I felt they were stronger down their right with Trippier and Arfield though Trippier did look knackered towards the end of the game.  So that might be something we can exploit, starting with Taylor and Routledge then bringing on Montero later to exploit his pace and potentially replace Taylor with Tiendalli if he is looking shaky again.

Dyer and Rangel should get a bit of joy down the right though and perhaps going with Gomis over Bony for this one as he looked a little sharper and Burnley's defence looked like they may make a few errors.  I expect we may get goals from midfield again as Jones and Marney for Burnley don't look like they can keep up with Siggy, Shelvey and Ki.",0,1408443692,null,0,false,0,cjufjxj,t3_2dx4rd,t1_cjufjxj,t3_2dx4rd,null,1435315767,1,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,1

&gt; 12.5 **Between 1994/95 and 2004/05 the annual total ‘cost of running the railway’ doubled from about £6.6 billion to £12.2 billion (in 2005/06 prices), as shown in Figure 12.1.**

&gt; 12.6 There were a number of reasons for this. One factor was that the number of people using the railway rapidly increased. So the number of services went up, which in turn increased the costs of provision. But this was far from being the biggest factor.

&gt; 12.7 The single most significant trend has been the increase in capital expenditure. This increased year-on-year between 1997/8 and 2005/6 and accelerated in the period from 2000/01. The investment bought two things: action to tackle a backlog of previous neglect; and enhancements to the capacity of the railway. But the bill for these improvements was inflated by escalating costs.

&gt; 12.8 The money committed to tackling the legacy of under-investment has been very substantial. Renewal spend had been very limited under British Rail in the early 1990s and for the majority of Railtrack’s tenure. But this pattern reversed following Hatfield and the Government’s own interventions from 2000 onwards. It was further stepped up under Network Rail. Total spend on renewals between 2000 and 2005/06 has been £14 billion. The result has been that Network Rail has already exceeded the 2009 target set for it by the Regulator to improve the condition of its assets.

&gt; 12.9 In Control Period 3 (2004–2009), total enhancement spend in real terms (excluding renewals) is estimated at approximately £5.6bn (11 per cent of total expenditure by the rail industry). This investment has delivered visible and valuable improvements to the rail network.

&gt; 12.10 The investment undertaken since privatisation was essential and reflects this Government’s commitment to rail. But there were serious deficiencies in planning and cost control under Railtrack. Neither OPRAF [2] nor Railtrack set a strategic direction for the railway, so investment was not always well prioritised or joined up. The replacement of slam-door trains was undertaken with little regard to the impact on rolling stock suppliers (who therefore faced alternating periods of overloaded and empty order-books) and with no regard to the need to upgrade power supplies to accommodate the new trains. The price estimate for modernising the West Coast Main Line escalated from £2 billion to £131/2 billion, before being brought back to £81/2 billion. There were similar problems in other areas of Railtrack’s renewals expenditure as well as its operations and maintenance budget.

&gt; 12.11 In the 2003 periodic review, the then Rail Regulator concluded that efficiency gains totalling 31 per cent should be delivered by the infrastructure operator by 2009, and Network Rail is broadly on course to meet this challenge. At the same time, the Regulator effectively increased the public expenditure for rail by £11/4 billion a year.

&gt; 12.12 On passenger operations, competition for franchises holds down the net cost to the taxpayer. It incentivises train operators to balance the increased cost of improving a service against the additional revenue it will generate.

&gt; 12.13 **Ultimately, the money for the railways comes mainly from two sources – rail customers or taxpayers. [3] Since 1997, the balance between these two sources of funding has changed significantly.**

&gt; 12.14 **Since privatisation, rail revenues have actually been growing more slowly than the growth in passenger numbers. This reflects the impact of fares regulation.** Regulated fares account for 43 per cent of revenues. Between 1999 and 2004 these fares were capped at RPI – 1 per cent; since then they have been capped at RPI + 1 per cent. The net effect has been a small real-terms decrease of 1.6 per cent in these fares over the last decade (Figure 12.3). [4]

&gt; 12.15 Train operators are free to set unregulated fares, but market forces (as well as the effective ceiling imposed by the price of the regulated season ticket) have imposed constraints. **The overall trend for fares (regulated and unregulated together) has been an increase of 1 per cent a year in real terms since privatisation. This is slower than growth in incomes.**

&gt; 12.16 The picture in relation to Government support (that is, taxpayer funding) has been quite different. Historically there has been considerable (and often year-on-year) variation in levels of subsidy, from 50 per cent of rail funding in 1992/93 to just 15 per cent in 1995/96, reflecting the sales of assets as part of the privatisation process. **However, since privatisation there has been a consistent increase in the proportion of rail costs funded by the taxpayer, and a pattern of 25–35 per cent subsidy in the second half of the 1990s has become 40–50 per cent since 2000. In 2005/06 taxpayers paid for more of the railway that passengers did (Figure 12.4). [5] This is clearly not sustainable.**

And that's why rail passengers are paying more.",0,1408443705,null,0,1408443925,0,cjufk0y,t3_2dys4c,t1_cjufk0y,t3_2dys4c,null,1435315776,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

**Good points:**

Excellent road network; ring-roads that are all dual carriageways, slip roads and roundabouts with hardly any traffic lights on the main routes.  Easy access to the A1(M!), A16, A45. Pretty much an hour's drive to Cambridge, or the beach at Hunstanton/Skegness.  Green Wheel cycle network as well, routes through the city as well as out to some of the picturesque villages, most of it properly segregated from the roadways.

Shopping; a reasonable (at least it was the last time I was there) town-centre shopping centre, and lots and lots of retail parks scattered around the outskirts.  Had the biggest Tesco in the world at one point IIRC.

Lots of green spaces; thanks the the New Towns developments in the 80s pretty much every area has at least some green space within easy  walking distance.  There's Ferry Meadows country park as well which is nice for walking the dogs on a Sunday afternoon.

Plenty of history if that sort of thing is your bag; The Normal Cathedral, the bronze-age settlement at Flag Fen.


**The Not So Good**

Orton Goldhay; pretty much a no-go area full of the worst humanity has to offer.  See also north Bretton.  At lot of the new estates that were thrown up during the New Towns boom are frankly horrible, tiny tiny little houses, maze like estates and dark alley-ways.

No soul.  Peterborough went from a small city in the 60s that was big on manufacturing (Perkins Engines, Baker Perkins, Peter Brotherhood, Newalls were all based there, and you could pretty much guarantee you'd be related to at least one person who worked at one of them).  The New Towns plan started just as these industries were in decline, and a lot of the new population were commuters to London.  Manufacturing industry was replaced by service industries (Pearl, Royal Sun, N&amp;P, LLoyds, Thomas Cook, Budget, and Churchill all had large operations there) most of which have now either gone completely or have outsourced the majority of their operations to India.

Sainsbury's are a business. Social order and justice don't pay dividends to their share holders. As a business decision they saw destruction of their stock as not worth it. The fact anyone who destroyed said stock could be prosecuted afterwards isn't really their concern.

Businesses and customers should not be hostage to the whims of whoever is rioting that day. The connection of current events overseas and products on sale in Sainsburies shelves are tenuous at best. 

&gt;  Your arguments always boil down to ""why should X have to..."" something. I take it you lock your doors before you go to bed. But, why should you have to? You should leave your doors wide open so your friends and family can pop in whenever they want or your postie can drop off packages when you're at work. Anyone going in without your express permission should then be prosecuted via the normal channels.

I'm not sure you can equate an open superstore filled with staff and CCTV during normal working hours to my home which is empty whilst the people in it go to work. I get packages delivered to my office so that I can ensure receipt and my family or friends would not pop in if I was not around. 

In other words - not the best analogy. 

My issue as it has always been is with the daft connection between events happening thousands of miles away and rioting local British shops because some of the produce happens to carry some association. 

As you say a lot of my arguments boil down to ""why should X have to..."" something. 

Why? Because it’s the pertinent relevant question. We shouldn’t have to accept it. We shouldn’t have to tolerate it. This is not Palestine or Israel or Iraq or some ISIS base. It’s the United Kingdom – which opened its arms to immigrants and made big efforts to help them feel welcome. 

Fuck those who abuse that. They’re not welcome.

Love to see some of the youth players I've mentioned previously getting their chance in the under 21's. Many of these players are just youngsters. Here's the match report.

&gt;Spurs defended the North end in the first half as both sides moved the ball quickly through the midfield where most of the play took place. Neither side made much headway during the half as both sides closed down quickly while the defences mopped up when they got through.

&gt;It was over a quarter of an hour before we saw the first real chance when Akindayini got into the area, but his effort was deflected wide for a corner. Potts got forward to fire well over the bar for West Ham. Lee fired over from a cross by Turgott, before Spurs almost broke the deadlock. Sonupe played a one-two with Onomah before driving in a low shot that was saved by Spiegel for a corner. The left side corner found its way to Ceballos on the far side who cut inside and curled his effort inside the far post where Spiegel pushed the ball away for another corner with Akindayini following up.

&gt;Lee headed a free kick wide before Spurs took the lead. With the West Ham defence pushing up, Onomah lifted the ball over them for Akindayini to run through and score past the advancing keeper. Spurs shaded the first half with the goal advantage to show for it.

&gt;Spurs replaced Sonupe with Oduwa for the start of the second half which saw both sides making better use of the wide areas to create more chances, opening up the game more. Oduwa got down the right to the line only to pull the ball back behind Akindayini. Ceballos whipped in a low cross from the left that went across the goalmouth without anyone getting a touch.

&gt;Spurs paid for those misses when Ceballos conceded a free kick on the right. Bywater scored, curling the ball inside the far post.

&gt;Akindayini had a great chance to restore Spurs' lead when the ball was deflected to him ten yards out with only the keeper to beat. The striker curled it outside the far post. The Hammers pushed forward looking for a second with Voss saving from Lee twice in two minutes.

&gt;Burke went wide from a corner, before Oduwa got free on the right and drove just wide of the far post with Ceballos failing to make contact sliding in. Miller replaced Onomah in midfield before Lee fired wide for the visitors. With the Hammers defending their eighteen yard line, Veljkovic played a long ball over the top for Ceballos, who had made a diagonal run from the right to beat the offside trap. The Spanish winger controlled the ball before finishing past Spiegel for Spurs' second.

&gt;Both sides made a change with Spurs sending on the more defensive Lesniak for Ceballos. Miller released Oduwa for a chance that was saved before they saw out the game with West Ham pushing for a second goal. Late sub Brown fired wide as Spurs held out to take the points.*",0,1408445570,null,0,false,0,cjufwok,t3_2dyy7d,t1_cjufwok,t3_2dyy7d,null,1435315911,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

I'm sure the fact that London is extremely overpopulated has nothing to do with it though. We have also seen wage compression of around 14% in the past 10 years, accounting for inflation. School places are at a minimum and the average class number has been rising rapidly every single year.

This is all a case of fact. Honestly the mental gymnastics you must have to go through to somehow believe that 250,000 extra people a year has no affect on public services, is just astounding.

I can. Because what they are and how they are is irrelevant. I can compare a squirrel to a safety pin if my point doesn't hinge on one being an inanimate object and one being a tree dwelling rodent.

The comparison is yours and the businesses convenient enjoyment of said thing. You'd *like* to enjoy your home free of the fear of it getting robbed, whether you're there or not. Sainsbury's would *like* to conduct their business free of theft and damaged goods/fittings. But you both exist in the real world, not fairy kumbaya imagination land.

You have to lock your door because it's the sensible reaction to the realities of the world you live in. Sainsbury's and other businesses may have to react to the realities of a mob of protesters who could turn nasty.

&gt;Why? Because it’s the pertinent relevant question. We shouldn’t have to accept it. We shouldn’t have to tolerate it. 

Which was my point yesterday about the overly emotional reactionary platitudes that have become really popular of late. You sound like a child. Why should we tolerate theft? Why should we tolerate rape? Why should we tolerate murder? Why should we tolerate crime of any kind?

This is where no agreement will be reached. You’re prepared to accept rioters attacking stores based on tenuous connections. I am not. 

&gt; Which was my point yesterday about the overly emotional reactionary platitudes that have become really popular of late. You sound like a child. Why should we tolerate theft? Why should we tolerate rape? Why should we tolerate murder? Why should we tolerate crime of any kind?

All that would hold water except that we’ve invited these issues in. Other countries are clamping down on rioting and some have seen none at all – the UK continues to be a soft touch and so issues abroad affect life here at home. 

I’ve already outlined my solutions above – you don’t seem keen to respect them which is little surprise these days. In a minute you’ll be whining that this sub-reddit is an echo chamber for people like me again… 

The sad truth is I’d be fine and shut up if these things weren’t happening. But respect people rioting over foreign issues and forcing local shops as a result:? No thanks. Not welcome. Don’t like it? Don’t riot in your host country and piss off the locals. Simple.

So either this money goes to the parents of the child - in which case that is incentivising people to have more children. £53 a week is a shitload more than current child benefit, so that's a pretty big bonus. And if it's fixed per child, that's even better. Chavs would love this!

Or the money goes to the kid and goes into some sort of trust for him/her to access. In which case, wouldn't that drive inflation of prices as I described. Your ""money is a field"" example didn't really explain that.

Suddenly an iPad at £300 isn't a luxury any more since a kid only needs to be alive for 6 weeks to get one. So demand skyrockets, and the price would surely go up so that the item stays somewhat prestigious.

Suddenly, putting £20k down for a house isn't such a big problem. Houses are finite, so the competition in the market goes up and the price goes up.

I'm all for a better benefits system with less hoops to jump through and sanctions and all that crap, but this guaranteed income stuff just sounds like such nonsense to me. There are 40m adults in the UK. To give them all £71 a week costs almost £150bn a year. That's 50% more than the NHS costs.

damn the landlord illuminati! 

but seriously both CAB and Shelters advise not to do it.

&gt; You don't have the right to withhold rent because of your landlord's failure to do repairs. If you withhold rent your landlord may start possession proceedings against you and put you at risk of eviction.
&gt;Even though withholding rent is not recommended, if you decide that you want to do it anyway, then you should keep the money in a separate bank account. This way, if your landlord did start possession proceedings, you'd have the money to pay off the arrears straightaway. However, in some cases, your landlord could still evict you even if you didn't have any arrears.

true,FiendishJ,null,null,"&gt;I honestly dont think not paying rent is a worthwhile idea

It's up to you, it's clearly a controversial idea, but I've been in 2-3 similar situations with landlords (yes I've been really unlucky), and finally, after being told not to, I stopped paying. Nothing got sorted - but I got to move onto the next place with a few months' rent in my pocket. The landlord has never so much as asked for it.

If your contract has continued as a rolling contract then it's not expired, provided it does say that it continues on a rolling basis, and isn't a fixed-term tenancy for some dates seven years ago. If the deposit is in a protection scheme, then the landlord can't just claim it. Although..

&gt;there is an inventory sheet (though a lot of the provided stuff has been replaced with our own).

This might be a real problem. Especially if you plan to take the stuff with you, and even if you don't.

If you want to stay and think the relationship with this landlord is salvageable, then keep paying rent, write them letters, and hope for the best. Make sure your contract is updated or at least relevant, and push hard to get the inventory sheet updated.

If you want to move on anyway, write the landlord a letter detailing all the problems. Follow it up in 2 weeks if you've heard nothing, and if nothing's sorted by next month, stop paying rent.

It might not be the ""right thing to do"", but I can tell you that it is the only thing you can do that is going to actually benefit you. Provided you're paying your rent, a lot of landlords don't give a shit about what else you do, and they won't make any effort to address your concerns. A lot of landlords get into this as a financial investment - and that is absolutely all they care about.

Keeping a bit of rent back not only makes them move, but also gives you a bit of cash if and when you need to move on. Legally, I'm pretty sure they've broken the terms of the tenancy agreement anyway - that's if you even have one, and if you don't, then you're not breaking any agreement whatsoever.

Even if they want to evict you, this can take *months*, and would be plenty of time for you to find somewhere else. It's also expensive for them, and they won't go down that route if you tell them you're leaving anyway - or that you'll resume payments when things are put right.

As for references, yes, landlords do sometimes ask for them, but you don't have to provide them - and this has never been a problem for me. Make something up if you have to. Old landlord is out of the country, you've only just moved out of your parents', anything.

**I'm being downvoted because what I say goes against the conventional - and perhaps legal - advice. That said, the conventional and legal advice is not in your favour, it is stacked in the favour of the landlord, and I can almost guarantee that you will be screwed and ignored if you follow it.

true,jacksleepshere,lfc12,,"Agger and Lovren are the most intelligent defenders I think we have and would be the best combination, but as Rodgers doesn't seem to want to play Agger for some reason, I'd say Lovren-Sakho should start against City. Skrtel is a bit too self-minded in his decisions and with Moreno likely to make his debut, I think our centre-back pairing needs to be as solid/mistake free as possible. 

Also Allen should start on the left side of defensive mid/centre mid, going back and forth with Henderson on the right. I think Manquillo worked well with Henderson defensively bar one or two mistakes, but that combination did lead to our opener. And Allen poses more of a defensive option for Moreno to bomb forward with Sterling on the left.

Edit: Here's how I think we'll line up. Also sorry for going so off topic.

Sturridge

Sterling (left wing) 

Coutinho (attack mid)

Hendo (right mid/wing)

Allen (left-centre mid)

Gerrard (Defensive mid)

Moreno Sakho Lovren Manquillo

Migs

The whole purpose of the legal system is so people can't arbitrarily implement their own ideas of revenge. Ultimately, because Miss Hook didn't agree with the outcome that the legal system reached, she decided to take matters into her own hands.

I disagree with the legal outcome that Mrs Hook just gets a fine, and doesn't get sent to prison for inciting violence, contempt and slander. Does that now make it okay for me to make up stuff to ruin her life, and put her and her family's lives at risk?

Perhaps you should contact the news publications and share the fact that Ford was also convicted of harassment, and you seem to suggest there was evidence he was a paedophile. If that's true, I'm sure these publications (especially the DM) would leap at the chance to out and shame a paedophile.

Likely cheaper, but it's not an easy answer - there'd be some retraining to do, applications that don't have a Win7 version will not have a Linux version, common applications are often different (Libreoffice vs MS Office for example).  Even if the OS itself is free, the support isn't.  Some governmental agencies in Europe have gone to Linux (French police, Munich council off the top of my head).

I know people who have repeated, and mostly I think it's due to the fact that they are not yet used to failure, or at least getting A's in everything. AS levels matter very little to anyone, except for the fact that you need to pass to get into A2. It's far better to repeat A2 if you need to, as universities will require a certain grade in order to get in.

As long as you've been allowed to go through to A2, don't sweat it (although make sure you work your socks off, as it will be a challenge). I had to have additional tutoring, and even then I only just scraped through.

If you do decide to do AS, you could probably get a part-time job in your spare time, as employers always want experience, and that's really hard to come across.

I think it would actually be the other way round. A high minimum price might be pushed through by the anti-legalisation lobby to, among other things, reduce the tax intake by pushing consumers to the cheaper illegal suppliers.

If legalisation is ever on the table but faces a strong opposition, the most effective tactic the anti- side could follow would be to condition their support to the introduction of high minimum prices, complex and bureaucratic licensing laws, and a forced review of the legislation after say 12 or 24 months.

That way, when cannabis became legal, the legal market would be stunted and would not provide the much-touted tax income, the illegal drug trade gangs would still be going strong, crime would not be significantly reduced, and police would still waste time tackling the illegal cannabis trade.

What we find 'racist' or 'offensive' is down to a huge number of really complex social, historical, and contextual factors. And you're right, generalising about a group tends to be racist whether or not the generalisation is positive. Someone saying 'Asians do work hard, don't they', does come across as racist. 

In your example, you're right that a character using the word 'nigger' would cause uproar. This is because the word is incredibly loaded with hurtful historical and social implications. It's pretty much the 'nuclear option', in terms of racist terminology. 

In terms of comedy, my personal opinion is that you need to look at who the joke is targeted at. A joke where the humour is pointed at someone less powerful tends to be in bad taste (in my opinion). Like Jim Davidson making jokes about 'poofs' and 'darkies', these jokes are targeted at mostly disenfranchised groups of people. Conversely, a comedian like Louis CK might make a joke with a similar subject (race, homosexuality), but the target in his case would be people in positions of more social power -- he'd be finding humour by pointing at prevailing racist attitudes. 

It's never cut-and-dry though, as it's such a complex issue. This is why people argue endlessly about it (i.e., it is funny when Jeremy Clarkson does it?).

&gt;They may well put ships to sea to protect their own trade and to make a political statement that these waters are in Brazil's sphere of influence.

They can put ships where they like, the UK isn't going to be concerned unless they get in the way of British vessels. 

The area is already in the Brazilian sphere of influence - we have very little in the way of interests down there. Our stance on the Falklands remains only because it serves to remind the world that few countries have the kind of hard power we do, and we're not going anywhere.

&gt;Argentina has a strong relationship with Brazil both military and economically. 

This is true, but if Brazil wants to be a superpower, it needs to play with the big boys, not Argentina.

&gt;Brazil as the leading south american nation may also want entrench its dominance by making strong statements of support against Britain and there in stand up to the US as well.

Again, I think that Brazil will want to increase economic ties with the likes of the US and the UK, not anger them. It gains nothing from doing this.

The fallout from supporting Argentina would be a lot more severe and polarising on the world stage than deciding not to back them.

For fucks sake, UKIP don't oppose immigration. They oppose free EU immigration for all. They want a system where the UK can *CHOOSE* who to let in, not a system which is based entirely on where you are from.

Jesus christ, I mean the guy you replied to even used an Indian doctor in his example, yet you're still spouting this bollocks about UKIP being anti-immigration.

Isn't the current immigration system profoundly racist? If you are from anywhere in the world outside the EU, it's a nightmare to come to the UK. If you're from the EU, it's simple. The UK has almost no control over the number or quality of people coming here, and all we can do is impose stupid restrictions (such as capping the number of non-EU immigrants) to keep the total number down.

That's a strong claim. It doesn't seem that plausible- women are systematically more likely to work at less successful firms? Is there any evidence of that? (Genuine question). Whilst I get that in general one desires *ceteris paribus* explanations, the fact that this comparison is within or disaggregated by their job type goes some way to correcting that. In fact, this is the main usual control when making these types of comparisons (years in the labour force notwithstanding). 

&gt; As /u/daman345 points out, young women are out-earning young men.

On average :P. According to the article, among this group there is a pay gap for women in this profession of 8%.

&gt; Where's the outrage?

I suppose the problem is that while the younger cohort is indeed more equitable, the current older cohort is still demonstrating a pay gap. That's a problem for women in that cohort- the fact that it will better for other, younger women may not be much consolation.

&gt; For fucks sake, UKIP don't oppose immigration. They oppose free EU immigration for all. They want a system where the UK can CHOOSE who to let in, not a system which is based entirely on where you are from.

Semantics mate. I missed out the word **mass**, which I used plenty of other times in the post, and you decide to pick out the one time I didn't.

It also ignores that we have natural population growth as it is. 

Claiming the EU system is profoundly racist is like claiming the UK is racist for giving preferential treatment to UK citizens over other citizens.

Sure he has a standout game every now and again or perhaps plays well for %70 of a game, and no one is doubting his threat going forward. However i dont think its a coincidence that we kept statistically more clean sheets with Agger playing last season (%per games played). 

We saw only too clearly on Sunday the difference between Lovren who is a proactive defender, not afraid to step up and challenge possession, and a reactive defender in Skrtel who relies on his (very good) reflexes to win a ball back. Im absolutely convinced that the mindset of the defence of last season and we saw glimpses of it against Southampton cost us at least 10-15 goals conceded. Dropping deeper and deeper and allowing opposition to have shot from outside the box will obviously lead to deflections and own goals, as well as room for an opposition midfield to operate infront of the back 4. Skrtel continuously asked for problems by dropping deeper as a first reaction and was contrasted and exposed next to Lovren who i thought looked really good and more what i think BR is trying to get from a centre half by pressing as an instinct. As to who the best combo is, I cannot se BR spending a combined 55m on 3 new back 4 players over 12 months without intending to start Moreno, Sakho and Lovren

Depends what acted was, stoping a ship to board it? It also depends of the crew and the shipping company. Where is the line? Where would the UK draw it?

&gt;They can put ships where they like, the UK isn't going to be concerned unless they get in the way of British vessels.

True but the US and the west of the world will be very concerned


&gt;we have very little in the way of interests down there. Our stance on the Falklands remains only because it serves to remind the world that few countries have the kind of hard power we do, and we're not going anywhere.

We have Oil potentially, plus a base to project power into the south atlantic if needed, which could be very important if ever Suez was out of action. Also the Antarctic, still a unknown.

&gt;This is true, but if Brazil wants to be a superpower, it needs to play with the big boys, not Argentina

Not sure I understand. 

&gt;Again, I think that Brazil will want to increase economic ties with the likes of the US and the UK, not anger them. It gains nothing from doing this.

It may well anger the US, but would it change their relations with them? I doubt it, this is sort of the crux of it. The UK on its own, mmm, depends how united Europe and UK allies are looking. I can't see such action hurting anyones relationship with Brazil, only Argentina. Brazil would perhaps gain from its show of force, clearly making it known that it is a strong regional power.

We have Hendo and Coutinho moving freely in the hole and Sturridge and Sterling positioned like 2 strikers, and when we need width Hendo goes out wide to cross or give the fullback cover. We used Hendo out wide that season to accomodate Suarez and Sturridge in 4231, but I feel Coutinho has to start and Allen would be vital to give us possession when we can't compete physically with CItys midfield. Let Allen and Gerrard keep possession and Coutinho taking the risk. If they start Navas then put Hendo on left wing and cancel out Navas/Zaba offensive.

true,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"Are people actually surprised by this, this is the exact reason he got dropped when BR first rocked into the club, he had a very heavy-handed approach that simply didn't fit in with the whole possession first mentality BR wanted to instill here. Last season though the irresistible form of the SaS forced BR to employ a new formation, with two men up top and Gerrard in the DM slot. This formation was totally attack-minded, so much so that Skrtel's clear first look around later approach was kind of a perfect match. With a lot of people committed forward, fully pushed up wing-backs (who weren't all that great) and an ageing Gerrard the last line of defence before entering into a ""...-on-two"" situation, Skrtel's back to the wall style of sliding/barging/clearing everything made sense. He was essentially a one man back-line, and his instincts while not perfect saved us in a lot of situations.

Now however the situation has changed, Skrtel has three new guys around him, all of them more faster and better on the ball than him, he needs to change his mentality a bit, he needs to co-ordinate with the others and he needs to stop smashing as much. We shouldn't be on the back foot as often as we were last season and Skrtel needs to figure out how to play himself out of trouble, or he won't be in the team for long. People forget sometimes that he's the same age as Agger, both will be 30 this year and while I don't see him being flogged anytime soon I don't know if he'll be able to change his game a whole lot either.

I genuinely expect Sakho-Lovren to be our CBs by the end of the season.

I mean I get it, I really do; the government is under great amounts of pressure from conservative elements to make sure ""Johnny Common"" doesn't swindle the tax payer out of benefits for a free ride, so they lean on the job center to make sure everyone has 100% proof of everything they do, to cut down on benefit fraud and the job center makes claimants lives miserable. Lord knows the tabloids love a good story about ""benefit cheats"" getting away with thousands of pounds.

But having grown up on benefits (my father was never in the picture, my mother had no marketable skills to speak of) I can safely say that the ""free ride"" the tories are all so concerned about isn't anything to write home about. You *never* have enough money, you can never do anything nice or get anything you want because the money had already been spent on bills, food and rent as soon as it comes in. I wouldn't say that the life is unbearable, but it's not something someone would volunteer for, it really is evident how out of touch the higher up MPs really are.

So now you have thousands of people who were already pretty bummed to start with being treated like suspects in a criminal investigation!

When all the polls are showing over 40% Yes, to assume it's only down to ""a few people"" is a tad myopic.  

As for the arrogance, the principle of the whole thing (as /u/calledpipes says) is for the chance for Scotland to take a different path to the one the UK is on. A change in identikit politics is something that I'd wager a majority of the UK want - this is just one way Scotland may achieve it.

In fact he clearly does not see the danger and walks throughout the phase.
* Skrtel can see it all clearly but does not react until too late. He probably thinks that the 4 players already there can handle it. He seems to have taken up a position in the centre of the box, perhaps zonally but really not marking anyone.

Yes, I was exaggerating when I said 'blow out of the water'. That would only happen if they used force.

&gt;True but the US and the west of the world will be very concerned

Why would they be concerned?

&gt;We have Oil potentially, plus a base to project power into the south atlantic if needed, which could be very important if ever Suez was out of action. Also the Antarctic, still a unknown.

Fine, fine. So we're not about to give them up just because Brazil says so.

&gt;Not sure I understand. 

Argentina is an economic wreck. The UK's GDP is half that of the entire South American continent. Why would Brazil want to keep old, impoverished friends when it can have new, prosperous ones?

&gt;It may well anger the US, but would it change their relations with them? I doubt it, this is sort of the crux of it. The UK on its own, mmm, depends how united Europe and UK allies are looking. I can't see such action hurting anyones relationship with Brazil, only Argentina. 

No, exactly. In truth, nobody would really care either way until any force was involved, and there would be few economic repercussions either way.

But crucially, Brazil has nothing to gain.

&gt;Brazil would perhaps gain from its show of force, clearly making it known that it is a strong regional power. 

I don't really think that's much of a show of force. It's hard to act big and bad when half your navy is made up of cast-offs from the country you're disagreeing with.

&gt;You mean 360million odd people? Quite a lot I should imagine and the same for anyone else who would consider strongly siding with Britain

Another powerful nation that isn't Europe strongly asserting itself on the world stage, the US does not want competition, it doesn't like it when other nations look strong. The world is dominated by the US yes due to its economic and military power but also due to influence, loosing out to a regional power is never going to be in their interest.

&gt;Argentina is an economic wreck. The UK's GDP is half that of the entire South American continent. Why would Brazil want to keep old, impoverished friends when it can have new, prosperous ones?

Same reason we are developing poor European nations, a larger domestic market for goods, geography really.

&gt;In truth, nobody would really care either way until any force was involved,

Look at what happen to stocks in Europe over Ukraine, the world does care and one big nation posturing up to another would really shake the world up. Think of the trade that moves from south America to the rest of the world, **potentially** disrupted by a naval battle. Nations with a stake in the region would be trying to negotiate peace, what if they have more at stake with Brazil and South America than the UK.   

&gt;I don't really think that's much of a show of force. It's hard to act big and bad when half your navy is made up of cast-offs from the country you're disagreeing with.

true,Smack_OP_Hard,null,null,"&gt; Again, what policies?

I just outlined two. I know they keep wiping them off their website, but thet were two of their last party-line stances. Zero tolerance policing (Which has been proven not to work in many studies, and does not reduce crime. There were MANY trials in the 80's and 90's in San Fran and New York.) Guess which groups were most affected? Poor black people. Why? Because police are just as racist as everybody else, except they can justify it.

And secondly, multiculturalism rollback. As a working class white guy, I know nobody who was ever affected by multiculturalism. Oh no you can't call somebody a ting tong in public? Or suddenly there are enforced 'black white black white' neighborhoods? Yes, some policies can go over the top, but it's trying to create a level playing field of enforcing respect. If 'real' multiculturalism was enacted, there wouldn't be huge parts of the country that are one race or the other (contrast Essex and Birmingham), because people like to live with their own kind, especially when immigrating. It's simply sad that it takes so long to change.

With both of these policies, they did not explicitly say 'Oh they are for white people', because that's illegal. But history has told us that they are things created by white higher/middle people FOR white middle class people. THEY believe it's what the British working pub man wants, regardless of everyone else ever.

&gt; You complain when politicians conceal the truth from you, yet as soon as an honest party emerges you literally treat them like the Nazis.

You're saying that as if everyone who isn't a ukip supporter is a supporter of the other main parties. You also seem to believe that there is a big majority of people who don't see the main parties lies and mistruths. There is a major amount of apathy because British politics is really bad. I can't argue against that, because it is. I just don't think ukip can or will provide any answers to that.

I'll tell you exactly who they are - they are angry Tories. Nothing more. Which parties is the most frightented of losing membership to Ukip? The Tories and very conservative Labour MPs (Which a lot of them are anyway, they just pretend they're not). If you don't like the Tories, they are just going to be more of the same.

As for 'honesty'... well I'll get to that.

&gt; Because it is unfair on everyone else who has to pay tax, sharing the rent on a 3 bed house

I'm sorry, but you seem to be mistaking this country for the Soviet Union. We live in a capitalist country, you are rewarded based upon how much you can earn and how efficiently you can do that. There is nothing stopping you for sharing your house with five of your mates in Germany, Scotland, Italy, making lots of money and buying a bigger house. Having children and growing up with a family is a social choice. Yes, some people have it forced upon them - but for the majority of the time they choose to do so based upon a social model - 'Oh I want to get a house, wife and two kids by 30'. 

Is it unfair that lots of people went to Spain and Germany in the 80's in large groups to make money and send it home, and now the situation has reversed, making it inconvenient for British workers instead? or does it 'inconvenience' you because you chose a less profitable life choice now when the going isn't so good? and everybody is after the same job? I will tell you something right now, there is no way in hell any Ukip government will make a 'British jobs for British people' law.

&gt; Clearly you have never worked in the building and maintenance trades, or know anyone who has. Why don't you go ask someone who does how difficult finding work and supporting their families has become, before making such dismissive statements, then maybe you can have a little bit of empathy for them. 

Few English people cared when they were working abroad, raking in foreign money. Yes, I agree with have an employment problem that isn't being helped by working immigration, but I cannot stand by a party that turns political agreements and government ineptitude into a 'the Romanians are coming to get you' argument. Racism is their primary marketing strategy, they don't give two shits about some builders job - the recession hit builders hard, and now it's picked up, people will flock to wherever there is work. That doesn't, and will never change.

Empathy should not resort to 'yeah fuck those people who are trying to feed THEIR kids while I want to feed mine'. If anyone is starving, it's the governments fault.

&gt; It's not ignorant and racists to say that Romanians are arrested

Sure, a lot are arrested. Is that for murder? Organised crime? Hell, a lot of those arrested are arrested for begging for friggen sake.

""if"" not, ""Yeah all them them are"". Farages comment is pure bear-baiting. ~200,000 Romanians are not living 8 in a 3 bed house. ""Yeah well I wouldn't!!"" Yeah, well... not many do. So his point was just to be racist. Why didn't he say anything about English criminals, who you are far more likely to actually be attacked by in the street? or Irish criminals? Oh yeah.. they're not 'cool' to be attacked by in the media because it doesn't serve his stance.

Cable / TV / internet 

I pay Virgin £26/mo for 100mb cable,  M packageTV and phone. And they chucked in TiVo too. Oh, and on a 12 mo contract.

How? I phoned and haggled for 5 minutes and said I was off to sky if thy didn't match a 50% off deal they were offering. They did - and bested it.

Mobile:

37/mo for latest Iphone + unlimited calls/texts + contract length spotify (worth £9.99/mo) + 4g + 5gb data (up from 2gb offered with contract normally). 24 month contract but really it's 12.

How? Called up after 12 months, said I was going to buy out contract to go to a competitor. Would sign with them for new contract if they offered better. Usually get a 15-30% off contract instantly. Selling old phone then easily covers rest. I ended up £30 up last time. You need a couple of hundred lying around for this to work though. If only temporarily. 

Sure 37 is expensive (I view it as 27 as I cancelled my spotify premium) but I'm a real gadget lover! I'm also a long distance commuter and 4g is amazing. If you're struggling financially a contract phone is not a good deal. 

I went to buy my first 'real' watch the other day and much to my wife's horror I started haggling. I got £200 off just by asking. She doesn't know that jewellery for her bday got a massive discount by haggling too. 

We also lease a car (I can't win this one - wife insists) but I do do the initial haggling. Secured a massive discount on monthly payments by spending 20 mins negotiating with sales guy --- and going at the right time. End of quarter, end of year, and right before number plates change. 

You'd be amazed at what haggling and a bit of planning does. Ok sure you can't do it in John Lewis or asda, but any small store you sure can.

All of our household bills and insurance are optimised once every 12 months -- It's always a massive saving for maybe one hours work.  Well worth it. 

Like many Brits, I am polite and quiet - and haggling is definitely not in my nature. It's something you learn bit by bit. The more expensive the object l/service the better your chances. Subscription services are particularly good.

It may not be the *most* competitive college (Kings maybe wins that one, I'm not sure), but it does seem to be one of the more competitive colleges.

I understand what you say about the attraction of Trinity; this could be reasoning for my previous paragraph. Also, I can see your point about the pool. I think the smaller, less subscribed colleges would be annoyed if the large prestigious colleges took *all* the top students, leaving them with below average students, so hopefully the pool would be designed with countering that in mind. 

I'm fine with sitting extra exams, though I'm somewhat wary that they could be used against me if they go a bit wrong. I've seen the sample tests on Trinity and Magdalene website for their interview tests, and they seem to be short and fairly easy; more like interview fodder than a test in themselves.

&gt;Er, yeah? Force was involved in Ukraine, that's what I said.

posturing is not force it is presumption of the use of force, much like North Koreas military drills


&gt;This is only true if anyone realistically thought force would be involved. Which they wouldn't.

Well like you said, if the Argentinians didn't back off the ships the UK would have to use force. It did last time no reason to think the UK won't again. 

&gt;We'd have to be talking a very long time down the road before Brazil is a military power to rival the UK, to the point at which it is almost impossible to speculate on what we're talking about.

Again geography, Brazil would have a huge strategic advantage, easily enough for it to be considered a threat if it wanted to be. I don't for a second think it would be, I think such action would be a ruse trying to see if they could push a european power out of the south atlantic.

true,peterduncan75,null,null,"I understand that Lucas was pressuring Tadic, but in football players have to make decisions in split seconds.  In this case, which was more important: 1) stopping Tadic from turning away from goal, or 2) tracking a runner into a goalscoring position?

The answer is obvious - if no-one tracks a runner into a goalscoring position and they get the ball, you would expect them to score.  In contrast - if a player turns a defender and curls a 20 yarder into the top corner... sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say ""great goal - can't do much more about that"".

Gerrard was there to block Tadic turning onto his left foot if necessary, Skrtel was NOT there to protect against the runner.  I am NOT saying the goal was entirely Lucas' fault or that Skrtel should be absolved of any blame - both players made mistakes that combined to mean LFC conceded a goal.  I hate playing football with players that don't track an opponent because someone else ""should have been there"".

You could even argue Johnson should have tracked Clyne.  He was facing the runner and Sterling was covering the winger.

What I am saying is that it is harsh to say that this goal was any one player's fault (not saying you were saying this - just trying to put my comment in one place - even though it replies to multiple comments).  Skrtel can be forgiven for expecting Lucas or Johnson to track a runner from wide, much like Johnson and Lucas can be forgiven for expecting Skrtel to be better positioned.

Given that Scotland's only land border is within a non-Schengen country (UK), and that country's only other land border is also with a non-Schengen country (Ireland), it would make no material difference to the rest of the EU if Scotland was in Schengen or not.

The rest of the EU already think of the countries on the British Isles as something of a special case, so I think it's far more likely to expect the existing arrangement to continue.

I think the most pressing consequence is the simple fact that it's *far* harder to test for marijuana usage than it is alcohol. There's no such thing as a marijuana breathalyser (as far as I know), meaning objectively more car accidents. You can't even punish those responsible with ""high driving"", it'd just have to be passed off as a normal car accident.

Not to mention, I am forced to inhale enough smoke outside from tobacco (a substance where second hand smoke is worse for you, on a lot of fronts), I don't want it from marijuana as well. Of course, there's also the fact it can (and will) gateway into more heavy drugs, but tobacco does the same.

I've no respect for people who pay money to damage themselves, and I can understand why this is a reason for people to want it to be outlawed. When people are suicidal, you tell them to seek help, not advocate for them to harm themselves. Same argument with marijuana, for all intents and purposes.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"Because it's an **evil drug**. Not like morphine or codeine.

I'm particularly incensed about codeine. Codeine is a *highly addictive* drug. It's also very effective.  But *even* in the low doses available over the counter (Nurofen Plus etc.) it is easy for non-habituated people to feel the effects. And they can be pleasant.

Here's the thing: The government goes on about the dangers of drugs. The government also recognises the risks of over the counter painkillers like ibuprofen and paracetamol, and have limited sales to 16 pills at a time (of each) at ordinary shops, or 32 pills at a time at pharmacies. There are surveys that estimates several hundred lives saved over the years since this limit was put in place, as it serves as a deterrent against suicide etc. (people who are ""on the fence"" and suddenly decides to do it, can be stopped by the tiniest little barriers, such as having to go to multiple places to get enough pills). 

*But when they then decide to allow over the counter sales of codeine - a highly addictive drug that is also extremely safe* - they decide to put peoples lives at risk by **making the drug more dangerous** by requiring that it is mixed with paracetamol or ibuprofen. 

Addicts that are unable to control their desire for codeine, are now - if they suddenly get their prescription for stronger versions (cocodemol for example) pulled, or are unable to get it or pure codeine from a dealer, - be put in a situation where their easiest way of addressing their addiction is to take a readily accessible, potentially lethal dose of the over the counter products. Products that are only potentially lethal because the government regulations artificially *force* manufacturers to make them lethal rather than ""risk"" that some people may use them recreationally.

And unlike someone at risk of considering suicide with painkillers, someone addicted to opiates is not likely to be deterred by having to go to more than one store to get their pills.

How can anyone take drug policy seriously when the government on one hand talks about the dangers of an illegal drug that is one of the safest drugs known to man, and yet at the other hand allows the sale of a drug combination that is as dangerous as it is only because of rules they themselves put in place when allowing the sale?

Honestly on our team im not the biggest fan of schurrle, willian, mikel, ramires and salah. I think ivanovic is a good rotation option but not great as a first choice.

We say we have good depth in attacking midfield but in reality we have hazard and a bunch of at the moment rotation level players. 
The players that are truly class enough to be thought as first choice would be costa, fabregas, matic, azpi, hazard, courtois/cech and I think our midfield pairing of terry and cahill is better then most but not hugely impressive, luis will hopefully show me that he can be clear first choice but still early. And I think fabregas would be better behind the striker in oscars role. 

So essentially missing a clear world class rw and central mid. 

I think as a squad Chelsea is very strong, possibly salah and willian shouldn't have been bought and money instead spent on a better dedicated wing player of higher quality. And I would really like having a player in the vein of maschareno, bulldog that is all pretty technical playing alongside matic. 

But as manu shows I think squads win leagues and we have mostly enough quality on and off the pitch for that. Just if I was rating our team maybe 85/100 with 2 world class players and 2 smart rotation options of being a 90+ team like bayern or real madrid. Barcelona are a special situation in that their team is only a 85-90/100 currently but messi raises them to the upper tier

true,Lou3000,flair1,,"Oh, c'mon, ITK is just reliable as the shit that gets posted constantly on here from the Mirror and the Fail.  

I like ITK posts simply because they are great ""what if"" scenarios.  We all posted endlessly on Griezmann and there was apparently nothing in that one, but I still thought it was fun to talk about what our squad would look like if he was at WHL.

As with this, I still have hope that MM is coming.  I would love to have a solid, top 4 level CB pairing.  You don't see the top teams cobbling together a back line week-to-week.  Though Dier and Vertonghen might eventually evolve into that.  I still think MS might come simply because rarely is an unsettled player is forced to stay these days.  However it isn't like Southampton have done anything that rational recently.  I think Depay will be at United.  

In fact, I think this transfer window may end in a flurry of activity.  United have been way too quiet considering the fact that they really need talent and just lost to Swansea.

I thought Lennon was on the chopping block, but Poch seems to rate him for some reason.  I think BAE, Dawson, Vlad, and Sandro are our potential departures.  Though personally, if we're selling a Brazilian midfielder I'd prefer it to be Paulinho.

One is an SOG micron, tiny little thing the blade is about an inch long.

Then I usually have my swiss army knife for when that's needed.
