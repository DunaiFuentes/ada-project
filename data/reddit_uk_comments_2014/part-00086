Sometimes that sort of thing is down to a single individual, too. 

I worked in a place where the head of IT was responsible for nothing ever being achieved, while diluting the profits down to near zero via pointless layers of middle-management and vast unnecessary hardware and licensing overheads. 

First sign of trouble was when I wrote a simple little fun JavaScript quiz as a marketing promo. Was told ""we can't run JavaScript on our server"" (never mind that the webserver was using SharePoint so it was loading in entire JS libraries and all manner of other shit on every page load, which took an unacceptable amount of time) ""because it introduces security holes"". Wat. It's totally standard and only deals with two client-side variables.

Next I tried to fix the appalling UI of the web-based product that was the company's raison d'etre and got absolutely nowhere. Then I was told that even minor changes to HTML required 5 rounds of testing and they ""simply don't have the resources"". I'm talking changes to HTML such as correcting spelling mistakes. 

My request for the introduction of a hosted CRM service: ""we'll build our own CRM, from scratch"". BUT WHY. You don't know fucking anything about CRMs. Get one off the fucking shelf that's had tens of thousands of expert man-hours put into it, and adapt it to the company's needs you dimwit, then hook it to our records via API, rather than hiring an extra six developers to start from zero. Oh, and this all had to be built on MS technology rather than open source, so he needed another 50K for the licences. This project went on for three years and burned through 300K before being abandoned. 

He ended up putting in a requisition request for a million quid's worth of new servers and server centre rental at a quarter of a million a year. I did a back-of-a-fag-packet calculation and showed the CEO that transferring our services to Amazon AWS would not only save 95% of that budget but would speed the fuck out of our shitty web-based product. IT guy's response ""I don't hold with putting it in the cloud - if you think about it, we're running our own cloud"". No, really, you're not. And since you have no plans to sell server space, you can't even call it a fake cloud to justify the expenditure.

He got fired a week after I left. My successor tells me everything's running fine now, everything's been moved to a real cloud, and they've adopted open source technologies.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"I find the terminology inherently emotional, and frankly, practically useless.

Key commodities have risen in price.  We've de-valued against the dollar (most fuel related futures are priced in USD).

This has definitely changed things.  Yet at the same time, certain great luxuries have never been cheaper.  I've got a £90 mobile phone which is brilliant, I remember spending thousands on computers that couldn't do as much.  My total TV related entertainment bill is £5 per month.  I can buy a pair of really good trousers for less than £10, that will last well too.

So whilst some key commodities and their directly linked products have risen, for some other things, we've never had it so good.

It's very complex, there will of course be some people who are worse off than they where say 10 years ago.

I really dislike this terminology, it's been created by some people who have nothing constructive to say or do, because they feel they are just a government in waiting.

I think the single biggest change we could do, to help the poorest in society, would be to look at properties.  Land value taxing, building more, population control.  Something to help fix the problem of a population that grows faster than we build.  Given the amount of our income we spend on accommodation, I think this is the biggest easiest, cheapest thing to control about our cost of living.  Food prices for instance are set mostly by global demand, energy and labour costs.  There is little any government can realistically do to lower those.",1,1395860488,null,0,false,0,cgcl6in,t3_21f874,t1_cgcl6in,t1_cgckird,null,1433080093,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

It might be scary, but I'm not saying this to make out like you're not being financially sound, I don't know your financial situation and I can't say what's best for you. But a conventional general rule is that for every 4% of your final salary you want to retire on, contribute 1% of your salary as a younger person. So if you want 50% of final for your retirement, contribute 12.5% of your salary for most of your working life. 60% being a number which is often picked by people as being what they would desire, leads to the 15% contributions.

I know it's not popular to be a doom-monger, but I think there's a shocking lack of awareness that young people these days are mostly going to work for about 40-45 years and then live for another 25-35 years after that.

Edit: Nigel Farage won that for me quite clearly. Nick Clegg's answers were all based on the fear that trade, business, tourism, immigration and skilled workers would not exist and couldn't exist because a similar law or policy couldn't be passed in UK parliament. 

All of the things would continue to exist if new British based laws were passed and there would be pressure from all of the people involved for it to happen. Business would still trade and make money in the UK, people would still come here to work and enjoy holidays, immigration would be tighter similar to a system like Australia where only people who can make contributions can come in etc. Nick Clegg based all of his arguments on the idea that none of the things in place now could continue.",0,1395861986,null,0,1395866354,0,cgcly4d,t3_21fpg1,t1_cgcly4d,t3_21fpg1,null,1433080455,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Are they? Why? Who gave you the authority to decide that? 

I don't need any authority to have my own opinion. It's a historical fact that laws aren't by their very nature a priori correct. Your statement was both rationally and historically false. It's simply not an argument to say 'it's the law', so what? When they used to ban condoms in US states you saved people lives by breaking the law and stopping the spread of venereal disease, I wonder what your response would have been? Blind obedience no doubt. There are many worse examples of horrific laws, they are never justified on the basis of just being laws.

&gt;Did you win a general election while I wasn't looking?

Why does winning a general election give you any right make decisions for me. I don't vote, I didn't consent to be governed. If you want some politicians in Westminster to make all your decisions for you, fine by me, but don't force me to accept that. Representative democracy isn't democracy. *""A man is no less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years.""* -Lysander Spooner-

&gt;I said if you don't approve of the law lobby to have it changed

So this is the only option. Even if we ignore the realities, that is lobbying only works for the rich, it still doesn't deny the fact that oppressed groups shouldn't have to appeal or wait for their freedom to be granted by the oppressor. *""Nobody in the world, nobody in history, has ever goten their freedom by appealing to the moral sense of the people who were oppressing them.""* Assata Shakur. The funny thing is you right-wingers don't accept 'lobbying' as an effective strategy when it comes to most other issues. 

&gt;I think people willing to ignore the law because of the opinion of 0.02% of the population

I guess that just makes me different to you. My views don't change with the whims of popularity. These laws would be wrong even if nobody thought they were or if everybody though they were. 

&gt;most of whom are not familiar with all the details of the case

Yeah I forgot the protests organised by her teachers and friends are worthless, they no nothing, I should have consulted this subreddit's far-right keyboard warriors

&gt;Lawrence is blindly obvious, in one case the police broke the law because of the culture within the force

They didn't break the law at all. Not only was racism completely legal at the time but what the officers did, in the most part, was completely legal. They watch Lawrence die by their feet without attempting to save him, that's no breaking the law.

true,advisorybored,null,null,"Q1) I admired Moyes for his success on a tight budget at Everton. That said, his style of play isn't all that enjoyable to watch. I would like to see him succeed, but he really has to alter his tactics to something more United-worthy in terms of results and entertainment.

I think he stays on for next season to mold the club to his style, but no promises after that.

Q2) Counter-question: who do you think is the least likeable United player and why is it Robin Van Persie? On another note, #freeshinji.

Q3) I haven't seen you play much as a fan in the States, but for Villa I think it comes down to Lambert's tactics at home. He goes away from the counter and tries to implement something more possession-oriented, and we get burned. Perhaps Moyes has a similar shift in mindset.

Q4) I'm a pretty new fan (circa end of 2012), but I like where Lambert is going. Villa play exciting (if inconsistent) football when on the break, and I think the squad will improve with experience. As for McLeish, there aren't many albatross contracts left - just Hutton and N'Zogbia, I believe. At least we aren't Newcastle.

Q5) Oil money. In all seriousness though, Everton has a fantastic setup, and we should aim for something similar. Moyes might not have paid enough attention to the youth system, but their coaches did a great job: Barkley and Rooney are the standouts. With the dawn of the FFP era, building slow has to be it, really.

Q6) History might not mean as much as it should to me. If they're good now, they deserve to contend now. Sometimes luck is on a club's side. It's just how it turned out.

Q7) Chelsea. Man City have a fantastic attack, but I think Chelsea's quality in the back will be the pillar they need to hold on.

Q8) United will be 6th, agonizingly close to a Europa spot. Villa will be 11th.

Q9) 2 - 1. Goals for Young, Rooney, and Bacuna.

I said Agger's form has not been good enough to warrant his inclusion over someone I feel is a far superior defender. EVERY goal we conceded at the weekend was at least in part Agger's fault, I implore you to watch back if you don't believe me. He was very suspect against United, lost RVP a couple of times and had he been RVP been in form we'd be lamenting him. He hasn't impressed for a long time, and whilst sure a lazy, yes lazy, fan such as yourself can point to a few clean sheets as sufficient evidence but there are so many factors at play and Agger has not done enough in my opinion. Rodgers has been consistent in playing the in form players so I'm disappointed he has picked Agger who is a large part of one of the most suspect defences in the league.

9' Players feeling it out at the moment. Suarez had a free kick go slightly over the bar in minute 6

10' Sturridge has a shot from outside the box. Goes over, but highlights danger.

12' Suarez drops the shoulder and rolls a Sunderland player. Back tracks a little lifts his head and tries to find Sturridge but pass is slightly misdirected. Positive Play so far.

16' Liverpool putting on the pressure. Johnson tries to run through shut down. Suarez is menace on the edge of the box. Ends with Johnson being called wrongly offside.

Note: Most of our threat is coming down the right hand side.

18' Beautiful ball by O'Shea to a pool fan in the crowd.

18' Cross from Suarez with outside of the boot to Sturridge. Beautiful, but its just too high and sturridge seems to have strained his neck stretching for it.

23' Pressure, nothing clear cut some loose touches meaning a breakdown.

28' Allen runs toward the right and cuts a shot back towards goal but over the bar. 6 shots 0 on target all over the bar.

29' Kevin friend the referee doesn't seem to want to give us anything. This looks like itll be hard fought one tonight.

32' Final products boys, final product.

34' Few touches in Sunderland Box. Anfield faithful getting behind the team.

35' 65% possession for the reds

35' Suarez making a run from the half way line dances through 1 - 2 players and gets a shot off... Wide this time but at least the shots are getting lower....

37' Suarez through on goal taken out by a defender. Yellow card. My opinion red. Debatable.

38' [Gerrard takes the free kick.... GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLL Top right hand corner!!!!!](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8gXe-kXWJU0/UzM7OTjWN_I/AAAAAAAAB8M/dQK3TygTMeU/s0/26-03-2014-GifNumber-238.gif)

39' Beautiful Free kick and the surprise of Gerrard taking it made manone step to the left allowing the gap. Well taken come on the reds!!!!

41' Liverpool fans singing ""We are Liverpool Tralalala""

43' Great save from a bouncing shot by Migs

44' 3 corner in succession for Sunderland. Soaking up the pressure.

44' Foul throw lol.

45' Foul by vagini? haha. Booked already for taking Suarez out that led to the goal... Nearly a second yellow

-----------Half Time------------- 1 - 0. 

Lads look more confident since the goal. Sunderland very fortunate to have 11 on the pitch. Analysis confirms Vergini should have been sent off... Twice. 

-----------------Second Half Kicks off------------------

46' Suarez took a shot right off the bat. His aim is a little off tonight...

48' [Sturridge on his left peg.... GOOOAAAALLLLL Top left corner. Top class. Small deflection that loops it a small bit.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BV9NmZbLUj4/UzNBErqddXI/AAAAAAAAB8c/3h3xnq-A2ww/s0/26-03-2014-GifNumber-239.gif)

49' Suarez looked like he was tripped through on goal again.... No foul.. Kevin Friend is no friend at all....

51' Liverpool looking supremely confident... Poetry in Motion. 

53' Coutinhio wants to get in on the action looks much brighter second half.

54' Lost my stream for a min but sturridge had a chance.. Corner out of it nothing came of it... yet

58' Knocking it about now.. Henderson loses out and Altidore passes to Jacarini? who is offside. Less mistakes.

59' Gerrard 40 yard pass to Suarez rolls defender, gets a shot off but once again off target.

60' Sub for sunderland... Missed the names... 

63' Nice play for Sunderland dink over the top nearly finds Key but its just too far. He was the sub.

64' Nice pressing by Sunderland nearly forces two mistakes. Just out of reach though. 

65' Lovely play edge of the area. Suarez into Coutinhio but couldn't life it over Manone. 

---ROBERT IF YOU ARE READING THIS I NEED A SMOKE AFTER.---

66' Lovely dink by Sturridge to Suarez to set him in to the right of the goal, tries to return the favour but sends the a lofty cross  in. 

[69'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgXE91CzmJQ) 15 shots for Liverpool 5 on target. 

70' Cattermole hits the underside of the crossbar... Migs beaten. 

72' Now Sturridge hit the crossbar. With a right footed shot. Hit top right of goal frame and came back out. Great game this. Keeper beaten again.

74' Livepool break wonderfully again. Ends with a penalty claim on Coutinho. He slipped just before his legs got swiped so once again quite debatable...

76' [Sunderland GOOOOAALL get one back from a corner that is not dealt with... GOes all the way through.. Key the sub i couldnt name gets on the end of it losing Flanagan.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kcGqE523LJo/UzNHjT3m8fI/AAAAAAAAB8s/E6leHnE4iwg/s0/26-03-2014-GifNumber-240.gif)

77' Substitution Sterling For Sturridge.

80' Liverpool trying to slow the game down. Suarez wins another free kick in a promising area. 

81' Suarez went for goal from it... And tips the back of the net after going over the bar. 

83' Sunderland break... Liverpool looked quite open a poor ball in the end leads to Liverpool Throw in 

85' Liverpool sitting deeper and deeper as time progresses... Sunderland have spent more time by the liverpool box the last 15 than the whole match IMO

86' Liverpool passes are going a stray... Bit of composure is needed 

87' They are trying to start the traingles again. Crowd trying to lift them but you can sense the anxiety around the ground. 

88' Colback buys a free kick right along the touchline(goal line) Johnson to take it.....

89' Free header is scuffed.. Grazed his forehead and its a HUUUGE let off for liverpool.

90' Resorting to hoof the ball forward... But it finds Suarez and he does his dancing... It looked like he might get through but dispossessed. 

90 + 1 (3 mins added)

91' In the corner... Free to liverpool is met with a roar from crowd.

92' YNWA starts to ring around Anfield as there is 30 seconds left.

For the EU, avoiding setting a precedent is more important than the marginal effects of disrupting British-European trade. Also, we might send £100bn, and they might send £150bn, but theirs is ultimately as a percentage of a much larger economy, and therefore disrupting that trade would be much more damaging for us than for them.

That said, Farage was quite predictably received very well in a broad sense, despite his content being arguably weaker. His manner, the line he took were perhaps easier to relate to and he didn't come across quite so politician-y. On the other hand, he attempted a couple of gags too which went down like a lead balloon. If he has any sense, he won't do that again.



Overall I'd say that went as well as Clegg could've hoped. He didn't drop any clangers and wasn't intimidated by Farage.

An ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund. A fund is a big pot that lots of investors (like you and me) put money into, and a fund manager decides how to invest the big pot. ETFs are like 'shares of a fund' which can be bought and sold for a value depending on what the fund is worth at the time.

Index funds are particularly attractive because there is no fund manager. Instead the fund manager is a computer, which buys or sells shares to maintain the goal of the fund. Consequently index tracker funds have very low fees that don't chip away so hard at your returns. As an example, a FTSE100 index tracker tracks the top 100 companies in the UK, buying and selling the individual company shares as they jostle for position.

Vanguard is an investment company. They specialise in providing low cost funds and index trackers, and have become insanely popular as a result.

Personally I prefer index trackers because I like to contribute a small amount monthly. ETFs cost money to trade (buy or sell a quantity), so they are not great for small-time monthly contributors like me. It makes no sense for me to pay £6 every month to add £50 to my portfolio, but if I wanted to buy and hold  £1000 in a particular ETF for a year then it would make sense.",0,1395865021,null,0,1395865326,0,cgcniha,t3_21cz6e,t1_cgcniha,t1_cgbvvsl,null,1433081193,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

* Being within a single legal framework and market prevents any sudden variance in law between nations or trade block. This allows for confidence in setting up shop and exporting to Europe. It isn't as easy as you think to setup a large distribution center, manufacturing center,etc so why take the risk that suddenly the EU may change regulation or put up a trade block to promote production internally.

* A single regulatory committee guarantees universal functionality across the worlds biggest grouped economy. Companies don't like regulations, especially not 27 different ones.

* A company can register a trademark and patent its hardware and have it apply across the worlds biggest grouped economy.

* The ease at allowing recruitment abroad filling skill gaps which can exist within the nation.

I agree that shops aren't just going to shut up shop and fuck off. But really how can you not see that by leaving and raising political or economical trade barriers why would any company setup a focal point in the UK to trade to Europe when its better to setup within Europe. You do realise Europe is our biggest exporter, these exports don't originate from companies who just fancied being located within the UK because it looks nice, it made financial sense at the time.

None of those are really being addressed in any serious way.

The problem with the idea of the 'cost of living crisis', is it means nothing.  It is completely baseless, emotional propaganda.  If we had a starvation crisis, then we would look at the simple economic indicators.

As is, for those who are poorest, we can use indicators such as CPI/RPI.  So whilst wages for some have fallen in real terms against those metrics, the reduction in income tax, for some will have helped more than the inflation.

To me, the emotive nature of the word crisis suggests something worse than a bit of inflation.  If we have a look at RPI vs Median Wage, we could pick 2008 as a start and 2013 as the latest data point.  I'm choosing 2008 to make the numbers as bad as possible.
http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/ukearncpi/result2.php has a nice little tool for this.

We see a drop in real terms of not quite 7%.

I don't think anyone can call that a crisis, a squeeze yes, but not really a crisis.  This is why I hate the term, it means nothing at all, it's just some bullshit emotive crap put around by an opposition that doesn't want to actually say anything real.  Can someone explain what it is in terms of economic indicators?

Given the latest figures the other day about the drop in inflation, whilst I would in no way say we're out of the woods, I don't think it's getting worse.  The key problem as far as I see it, has been wage stagnation whilst inflation was 4% for two years, whilst it's now been under 2.5% then 2.0% and is currently 1.7%, I don't think there is anything productive to be had in saying we've a cost of living crisis.

I would imagine that would all depend on what exactly you're taking them to court for. You said that its for a breach of contract - your contract might have terms that outline your questions. Its important to make sure that you get the write address down on the form as if you get it wrong the court might not be able to serve a summons.  I'd reccomend taking to CAB or the law clinic you're going to see - typically if your case gets taken on your advisors will help you fill out the form!

Also have you contacted natwest to try to resolve the issue outside of court? Its important to show evidence in court that you've tried to resolve the issue outside of litigation first. If you just go ahead and take them to court it might not reflect well on your case. The best way is to write to them with the resolution you need and warn them that you may go to court if this is not sorted. Also writing and giving them a reasonable time to reply like 'I would appreciate it if you could respond within 14 days of receiving this letter...' is good form.

Hopefully if your case is taken up by the clinic they will be able to help you with all this. I don't think you need to rush off and take them to court right away - just looking it up you have 6 years to act on a breach of contract before the time limit runs out.

It's literally from other people replying to this comment, if you don't read those, you'll just be saying the same shit other people have said.

&gt; I'm all for promoting from with-in. If, say, this was Ledley who was the interim manager, we would be having a different discussion. But you can't use Guardiola in the same context as Sherwood. Guardiola was technically and tactically gifted. He dictated the way Barcelona played while Cruyff was coach, much the same way Xavi does now.

I don't buy into the great players make great managers and whist the whole ""intellegent footballers who control play"", suggests they make a good manager it doesn't mean they will at all. You see too many great playmakers turn into quite crap managers for that to be the clinical factor.

The fact you think we should give more leeway to Ledley than to Sherwood in the managerial position, whilst it is nice and respectful to a player that's obvious a legend for the club, it's still about his playing career rather than coming through coaching the reserves or B-team or the youth team.

Let's break it down.

Say you earned 5% per year, but you had a charge of 0.69%, so the total interest is 5%-0.69% = 4.31% per year.
So after 45 years you would have:  1.0431^45 = $6.67.

Now say that you didn't have the charge.  So you put in $1 and earned 5% per year.  After 45 years you would have:  1.05^45 = $8.99.   Which is $8.99 - $6.67 = $2.32 more.

Now $2.32 / $6.67 = 35%.  So you would get back 35% more without the fee.  (35% != 36% just because of rounding errors).

&gt; Both the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights put the protection of religious belief in this matter beyond doubt. We will draft the legislation to ensure that there is a negligible chance of a successful legal challenge in any domestic court, or the ECtHR that would force any religious organisation to conduct marriages for same-sex couples against their will.  Any possible claims would be brought against the Government, rather than an organisation to ensure religious organisations would not have to use their resources to fight any legal challenges.

By the wording of that it seems like the onus is already on our own government to write the legislation correctly and precisely enough to ensure that can't happen, but then again I'm certainly not a lawyer so I wouldn't bet on it.

The fact that we had to write in a special exemption for the Church of England just complicates matters more, actually if i were going to bet on which part of this legal equation might one day end up going to court, I'd guess it'd be our own anti-discrimination laws being brought against the CoE exemption.

Q2) I really dislike Fellaini. I remember seeing him headbutt someone while he was on Everton and have wished him misfortune ever since.

Q3) We are much better on the counter-attack, which is easier to do away. So it's more of an ""ability"" away, rather than inability home. 

Q4) I like Lambert; he seems to be able to work with what he's given, while setting us up for the long term with many youngsters. McLeish managed Birmingham before arriving at Villa, so I think it's just a matter of installing air fresheners.

Q5) Money and Midfielders.

Q6) Yes. I'd rather Arsenal, Liverpool, and United switch off for a decade than have Man City buy more trophies.

Q7) Liverpool in my opinion, they can't not score. We proved that Chelsea can be beaten, and I *really* do not want Man City to win.

Q8) I think you will get 6th after Spurs continue their downward trend. I think we'll get 11th or 12th based on our match with Hull on 3 May.

Most advisors at clinics (at least the one I volunteer for) won't be able to give you advice right away (and should tell you that) as they need to get it checked by a supervisor (usually a professor or solicitor) to make sure they give you correct advice. The good thing is though they can handle all of the letter writing/form filling ect. for you  (obviously though they will need to ask your permission when you first meet to do this!).

&gt;Approximately 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) from the dam is the reservoir's straining tower. Standing only 30 metres (98 ft) from the shore, its purpose is to filter or strain out material in the water with a fine metal mesh, before the water flows along the [aqueduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply\)) to Liverpool. Its architecture represents [Gothic revival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_revival), built at the same time as the dam. The tower as a whole is 63 metres (207 ft) tall, 15 metres (49 ft) of which is underwater. The other 48 metres (157 ft) is above water, and is topped with a pointed copper-clad roof, which makes it look light green.

So I don't think it is controversial that religious institutions can't turn away people on racial grounds - but it becomes controversial when it comes to sexuality and/or gender.

The current law, as drafted, makes it clear that it is up to religious institutions to decide whether or not they want to perform same-sex weddings. And that seems to be fine with EU and ECHR law at the moment - both providing huge opt-outs for religious institutions.

The Church of England is a bit more complicated as it is part of the state, so EU law and the HRA directly apply to it (in some cases). Hence the 'triple lock' in the same sex marriage law. Perhaps the solution there is to disestablish the CoE.

My impression is that the argument against same-sex marriage on the basis of EU or ECHR law is rather weak (particularly given the courts of both institutions have ruled against it in the past) - UKIP in particular seem to be using it as cover to avoid taking a position on same-sex marriage (they'll lose either way) while bashing anything European.",0,1395868887,null,0,false,0,cgcpi16,t3_21fpg1,t1_cgcpi16,t1_cgcorjz,null,1433082129,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It's discrimination because you have a service provider (a church or mosque or whatever) saying ""we will provide our service to couple A, but not to couple B because they're gay.""

That's discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation - which is usually illegal under the Equality Act 2010 (although there are all sorts of exceptions).

However, the Church of England is in a bit of an awkward position as it is part of the state - with special powers. This means that it is slightly easier to bring claims against them for breaches of EU law or human rights. The obvious solution is to dis-establish the Church of England, but I think some English Christians quite like their church having special privileges and powers.

note also that the character is referred to as ""doctor who"" in the end credits of most of the classic episodes. eccleston is also credited as ""doctor who"" in the first season of the 2005 reboot. 

people called him ""doctor who"" because that's how the character is listed in the credits, even though the doctor never identifies himself as ""doctor who.""

it was only with david tennant that the character began to consistently be referred to as ""the doctor"" in the credits:

&gt;""It always bothered me,"" he explains. ""It struck me that 'the Doctor' was his name, whereas Doctor Who was the name of the show. He's not called 'Doctor Who'. His second name isn't 'Who.'""

Being debt free gives you a nice place to build financial stability for the long term. 

I'd say you should fill up your cash ISA allowance for April (£5760) which will give you a decent cushion if you ever need to get at a few grand in short notice. Then set up something for your retirement (compound interest over a longer period helps out), so either a SIPP or some sort of investment (index trackers seem to be very popular here and are definitely in fashion at the moment but do your own research to make sure you understand the product and what your options are). 

In June your cash ISA allowance will increase from £5760 to 15k so if you want to increase your weighting to more cash then you will be able to top up that ISA to 15k. No problem with doing that but I'd make sure you've got a regular outgoing into something that isn't cash to offset the loss due to inflation. Obviously you'll need to look into what your risk level is and how accessible you want that money but £50 a month is a good starting point (and usually the minimum) for investments. That'll give you a good handled on the product, an idea of the charges and you can see how the product works before upping your monthly payments to increase the investment amount.

&gt;He promoted Sergio Busquets, Thiago Alacantra and Pedro to the first team and he bought Dani Alves, Pique, Sedou Keita, Alexis Sanchez and Cesc Fabregas.

Barcelona have a good academy. Again, I don't see what this has to do with Pep. And spending money on players like Dani Alves and Sanchez is a no brainer and nothing to do with any sort of brilliance. Again, it has nothing to do with Pep but more to do with the Sporting Director in Spain. So its incorrect to say Pep built that team. Also, Pique and Fabregas were quite literally emotionally coerced into joining Barcelona. Again, it has nothing to do with Pep.

&gt;Almost all of those players played/play a huge role in Barcelona's success during his spell and afterwards. He wasn't handed a team, he made one.

Like I said.. He didn't build shit. The manager is not responsible for transfers in Spain and besides, most of them were no brainer transfers so its not like it took an act of brilliance to turn them into epic players. And if you want to count the good transfers why ignore the unsuccessful ones like Hleb or buying Ibra for £40m + Eto'o then selling him the next season?

At Bayern he's was handed a squad that had made it to the final of the CL two seasons in a row plus pretty much poached their rival's best player and 2nd best player in Gotze and Levandovski.

There's a few issues I have with most assessments though. Moyes is not the most negative manager in the league. He was pragmatic (to the point of ridiculousness most times) in ""big"" matches. Against United last season, we were played off the park and that was typical, as the team would look to escape big matches with a point instead of three. 

BUT, Everton played some pretty good stuff last year - the team goals against Newcastle and West Ham stand out - and they were capable of playing exciting football every now and again. It's just now Roberto has tweaked the style to point where we look like a different and much more exciting team. 

Overall, most Everton fans will tell you he is a man for building a stable club. He could have stayed at Everton forever and kept us at 6th/7th/8th. His impressive legacy in putting Everton back on course after flirting with relegation will stand the test of time with most Evertonians. But could he have got us a trophy? Possibly not.  

To cap this all off, his arrogant attitude to the club when he became United manager means that most of us don't particularly care what happens to him now.

What Guardiola did when he came in was get rid of all the prima donnas like Ronaldinho and Deco, and focus around building a balanced team made up of hard workers like Iniesta, Xavi, Busquests and Messi and shape his tactics around them. That's the reason why Eto'o and Ibrahimovic lasted one season with Pep. 

I'm not sure what you mean by Guardiola's tactical short-comings as the man has redefined football as we know it. All this renewed talked about possession based football and playmakers is Barcelona's legacy as an undefeatable team between 08 - 11. Prior to that, everyone thought the game was headed in a more physical direction, and players like Xavi and Iniesta would be made obsolete. Hence why Guardiola retired when he did. The defensive high lines that we are failing to implement were done beautifully by his Barcelona. Talking about his supposed tactical short comings is an insult to what the man achieved and the innovation he brought to the game. Hell, the Spanish national team owe their success to him to an extent as they use his tactics.

Tim is not Guardiola. Its delusional to think he is. Not only he has not achieved the same things, but he doesn't even have the same tools at his disposal.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Erm.. What? Did you watch them under Rijkaard? They used to close down the ball exactly the same way. He got them playing short passes a lot more and got Messi to play more centrally but it was not as revolutionary as people like yourself make it out to be.

Are you serious? ""He just got them playing short passes more"" ????? He did more then that he completely re did the tactics. Rijkaard liked to close down the ball but so does Chelsea, doesnt mean they played the same. There was a *huge* difference in style and its still evident today.

&gt; Barcelona have a good academy. Again, I don't see what this has to do with Pep. And spending money on players like Dani Alves and Sanchez is a no brainer and nothing to do with any sort of brilliance. Again, it has nothing to do with Pep but more to do with the Sporting Director in Spain. So its incorrect to say Pep built that team. Also, Pique and Fabregas were quite literally emotionally coerced into joining Barcelona. Again, it has nothing to do with Pep.

Wow, this one is just difficult to read let alone reply too. First off, Fabregas and Pique were ""coerced"" into joining Barcelona, really man? I wont say anything to that because that is just ridiculous. Secondly, spending money on Dani Alves and Sanchez isn't a ""no brainer"". If you think those were no brainers results then do you also think all of Mourinho's purchases were ""no brainers""? Oh, and what does Pep have to do with their academy? Well the fact that he has had such a huge influence on the training done in la Masia now is one thing. And the fact that two of Barcelona's most important players were players he basically nurtured and made into stars is sort of important.. Thiago, another one of his pupils joined him at Bayern, you can see how well he is already doing.

&gt; Almost all of those players played/play a huge role in Barcelona's success during his spell and afterwards. He wasn't handed a team, he made one.

He promoted or bought nearly half the team that was so successful during his reign as manager. How can you still say he didn't build anything?!?",1,1395872723,null,0,false,0,cgcrda2,t3_21fik2,t1_cgcrda2,t1_cgcqtbk,null,1433083075,-6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-6

true,Deepfried_Goods,num11,,"I would highly recommend you read the book Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World. When it discusses the lead up to Guardiola's reign you get an idea of how Barcelona weren't a well oiled winning machine prepared for Guardiola to inherit. It was in many ways not dissimilar to us, the dressing room was a state, many of the players had unperformed in the previous season. He knew the most important thing was to reinvigorate the players through instilling his philosophy (which he changed from the previous years more than many give credit for) and doing so through making the players play as a team, which is exactly what Sherwood is doing. You cannot force your philosophy on the players if they are not working together as a group, that's exactly what we saw with AVB and his last days. Right now there is an obvious difference between then and now and I'd say it was an improvement

While I admit many performances under Tim haven't been exactly setting the word alight. And alot of that is to do with the fact that we are trying to change our squad from a group of talented individuals to a team that works as one. The two results after an admittedly poor performance vs Hull were arguably amongst our best of the season against Everton and Newcastle. I still think we are making progress whenever we have a full team at our disposal and think it will improve under Tim.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Off the cuff I'm sure most will say ""Will"", but is the Doctor really that strong in will?

Remember, the Green Lantern Corp. isn't just about normal willpower. It's talking about absolute resolution. To be a Green Lantern you need a will tougher than iron. You need to be among the most willful, unfaltering, unshakable creatures in the entire universe, someone without fear.

And this includes the fears of the self and other forms of self-doubt, and this is where I believe the Doctor genuinely falters. 

I don't know if the universe of comics contradicts this, but the DCAU Justice League episode *Hearts and Minds* really underscores how a lack of total unwavering confidence in themselves can make a Green Lantern powerless, as what happens to John in this two-parter. 

I believe that the Doctor doesn't really believe in himself that much. In fact, I've posited that the Doctor's greatest fear is of himself. At the very least, he's admitted to significant amounts of self-hatred and has frequently dropped into long bouts of brooding depression as of late, often in reaction to his own misgivings.

A Green Lantern can never question themselves like the Doctor does. Simply put, the Doctor's will is not unbreakable. 

However, one could argue that the small Indigo Tribe of power rings (fueled by compassion) would be best for the Doctor. Can he fail to have compassion at many a time? Absolutely. 

But when it comes right down to it, the Doctor's more likely to throw himself into the path of a bullet than fire one himself. He's an incredibly compassionate creature, and out of all of the power rings I'd argue that's what best suits him.",0,1395873983,null,0,false,0,cgcrydq,t3_21gd6u,t1_cgcrydq,t3_21gd6u,null,1433083357,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Umm, no. Barca have always played good football since Sir Bobby Robson.

&gt; Wow, this one is just difficult to read let alone reply too. First off, Fabregas and Pique were ""coerced"" into joining Barcelona, really man? I wont say anything to that because that is just ridiculous. Secondly, spending money on Dani Alves and Sanchez isn't a ""no brainer"". If you think those were no brainers results then do you also think all of Mourinho's purchases were ""no brainers""? Oh, and what does Pep have to do with their academy? Well the fact that he has had such a huge influence on the training done in la Masia now is one thing. And the fact that two of Barcelona's most important players were players he basically nurtured and made into stars is sort of important.. Thiago, another one of his pupils joined him at Bayern, you can see how well he is already doing.

I'm multi-tasking so don't have the time to edit my posts. But anyway. Yeah, they were both emotionally coerced. If you don't agree with that go back and read the transfer rumours. Xavi, Iniesta and the other Spanish players were literally all over Fabregas about joining Barcelona, especially after the Euros.

Chelsea were in for both Alves and Sanchez. They were no brainers. I don't understand what you mean by Jose's purchases being no brainers you have to elaborate.

What are you on about? Pep has never managed Barcelona's youth team or academy let alone having a huge influence. He was manager of their reserves for **one** season lol. He wasn't even Barca's first choice when they appointed him coach. Yeah he coached Pedo and Busquets in the reserves, but its extremely far fetched to say he was the reason they are as good. They were always talented players, which is why Barca signed them to play for their youth teams. Its even more far fetched to say Pedro and Busquets are 2 of Barca's most important players. Busquets maybe, but not Pedro. In fact Pedro is being linked with a move away from Barca this summer. And Thiago Alacantra was world famous even before he made his first appearance for Barca's first team. Thiago left Barca due to a lack of first team chances, which was also under Pep and later Tito.

&gt;He promoted or bought nearly half the team that was so successful during his reign as manager. How can you still say he didn't build anything?!?

Because he wasn't in charge of transfers and the players they brought in were already world-class players not to mention he had the best player in the world in that squad.

true,Rapscallian,null,null,"I was at the game tonight - and let me start off by saying that this was one of the most dreadful games I've seen at Upton Park. We were lucky that Hull went down to 10 men, but even then they took a majority of the possession.

What I thought was the worst, was the fact that we can't pass for shit. Honestly, watch the game back and see if we string together more than 5 passes before either hoofing it and losing the ball or passing it out of play or something. We also could not pass it forward, if you don't want to frustrate the fucking fans then don't go from a position where you can cross it in all the way back to the keeper for a good ol' hoof.

Secondly, Carroll simply isn't working. If you're going to play the bloody hoofing game, then make sure that they have support... There were very few cases where we retained possession after a Carroll header. At no point did Carroll really look like he was going to score, hell, I think he even missed the ball in an attempted shot at one point.

Thirdly, Allardyce's choice of substitution was absolutely dire. I think Joe Cole was a brilliant choice at that stage of the game, but to take Diame off is utterly baffling, he was the only real spark in the West Ham team tonight and was really the only one who actually went forwards rather than backwards. But no, for some strange reason, Allardyce chose Diame to come off - not Taylor (who, let's be real, is fucking useless at the moment).

Hell, I could go on for ages.

I don't know why people say he isn't good going forward either, because that season he got 1 goal 5 assists, which isn't bad at all for a full-back, to put that in perspective, Zabaleta this season (similar number of appearances) has 5 assists no goals, I know those stats aren't everything, but a Man City fan will confirm he is good going forward.

In-fact he's actually also a CB, which is great for cover, but he's played in the full-back position because he's so good going forward; few defenders can catch up with him *and then* outmuscle him.

The major thing is injuries, it's the major reason he's been benched so much, but then again, never getting subbed on but then being thrown into full matches hardly helps his recovery. He's not exactly been given a good run of games since Mancini left, even when not injured.

We're the country that has libel law, huge communities of recent immigrants living in poverty and resentment towards us, we're the country who is being forced to pay out into the EU to prop up other countries when running at already sickening levels of deficit and debt that our children will have to pay off.. With a weakened forces to protect ourselves if we do need to default, compared to what we were. We're the country bringing up a generation of renters.

I'd move over there in a fucking heartbeat, but I can't. My government hasn't set up any deals of free movement of labour with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the USA, or any English speaking country whom the population would love to work and move to, on a mutual basis. Instead we have the options of Romania, Poland, foreign speaking nations that are culturally a hell of a lot different to us. Furthermore, as an extremely adequate and top notch salesman, I'd make a fucking damn sight more in the US than I do here. Selling insurance to people whos first language, 'banter' and culture is different is a lot harder, and pays less.

Farages worldview and that of UKip would give us all greater horizons if UKip pushed for greater commonwealth and western closeness (for lack of a better word).

Unlike the UK these days as we're just falling off the world stage and into the EU instead. 

UKip in my eyes is a party for people who genuinely want more from the UK, and thinks bigger on an international level, rather than putting all our eggs in the EU basket as somehow we can't make it on the world stage anymore, despite well over half the world speaking the language that originated from our grey damp bog island.

* Build it as a 'platform' that can be deployed for other cities.
* Use of a dedicated anti-spam service like akismet.

true,almdudler26,eng-eastsusex,'Astings,"&gt; *Has Top Gear jumped the shark?*
&gt; 
&gt; The 21st series of BBC motoring behemoth Top Gear started last Sunday, attracting over 5.3 million viewers for the first time since 2011.

&gt; To call Top Gear a car show would be unfair. It’s not; really it’s just a sitcom which just happens to revolve around cars. And whatever you think about any of its presenters, you’d be hard pushed to find anybody who could watch an episode without at least smiling.

&gt; Only the most naïve of viewers would think the show is as off-the-cuff as it makes itself out to be. It’s well known that the show is heavily scripted, with genuine bits of improvisation few and far between, but that doesn’t make it any worse; the writers are very good at their jobs, as are the hosts. It’s usually a very funny show.

&gt; Sunday’s episode, however, gave up any pretence that the programme was set in the real world. We had the usual segments: the News, the ever dreary Star in a Reasonably Priced Car (though no review of a ridiculously fast car this time), but the main part of the show was devoted to one of the hosts playing a teenager (complete with luminous green baseball cap) driving a 90s hatchback, while the other two chased him playing policemen (complete with 70s moustaches) in present day police cars. All of this took place on an abandoned military camp in Wales, and involved the usual array of trucks, tanks and explosives.

&gt; Top Gear seems to have finally accepted that it is little more than a cartoon. People don’t watch it to learn about cars; they watch it to be entertained. The only problem is, going by Sunday’s dire episode at least, it isn’t very funny. The jokes could be seen coming a mile off. The challenges are now sent to the presenters by text and written in text speak, because of the youthful producers. Hilarious. It was all material we’d seen before.

&gt; It seemed that Top Gear had hit rock bottom with the India special of a couple of years back. Since then it had noticeably improved; the last series was very amusing. If Sunday’s episode was anything to go by, however, then it seems to be heading back there. It won’t be cancelled, of course, as it’s one of the BBC’s biggest earners, being shown in hundreds of countries around the world. No doubt they will eke out every last penny from it, letting it die a slow and painful death. It’s becoming a parody of itself.

This again, push the idea that because there's a cap that affects a tiny fraction of 1% of people on benefits, that everyone's getting it.

There's something wrong in not getting by on thirty grand, sure, but the people in need of food banks are trying to get by on nothing, or if they're lucky, forty quid a week, if they qualify for hardship payments.

Even if he's correct about the local foodbank not being oversubscribed, it still shows either a wilful ignorance of the facts, or simple and hateful twisting of the facts to portray benefit claimants as living in luxury and asking for more.

Ok now I KNOW you have no idea what you're talking about. That is the most simpleton way of describing a teams tactics I have ever read.

He is he one who moved messi from the wing into the f9 position  he is the one who started the tiki-taka football that Barcelona has become known for. 

You didn't seriously just say ""but they've always been playing good football,"" my god that is so ignorant.  Many team play good football, but there are so many styles.  

Pep IS a tactical mastermind, he is the one who has moved lahm from fb to defensive midfield where he has become a top 5 DM in the entire world in just one season.

If that goal had stood, we would've finished that season on 70 points with a +26 GD. That puts us level on points with Arsenal, but with a GD of only +25, they would've finished 4th and us third. *They* would've been knocked out of the CL by Chelsea's win. *They* would be despairing and wondering what could have been.

He's a guy with the powers of a god, running away from his past, and trying to do some good while he's at it. Everything that he did, however evil, he did because he felt it was the right and just thing to do. I guess it comes down to your criteria for ""good man"".

By good football I mean attractive, attacking football.

&gt; Pep IS a tactical mastermind, he is the one who has moved lahm from fb to defensive midfield where he has become a top 5 DM in the entire world in just one season. I understand some people don't like pep because of the rivalry with Barcelona but come on.

Lahm played at DM when he was younger its not a new position for him and he was the best RB in the world before that. Its like saying moving Luiz from CB to DM by Benitez was a tactical masterstroke when it was evident to everyone that watched football that he would play well in that position. You sound like someone who has built up his opinion of Pep based on what's on /r/soccer.

If UEFA weren't such a corrupt organization Pep would never have won the CL. In his first year Barca wouldn't have been in the final had it not been for Overbo. In his second year he got beat by Jose and bitched about it. In his third year we beat him again after which he bitched and left the club. Also, in every single one of these seasons he has had help from referees with opposition players being wrongly sent off. Doesn't sound like any tactical genius I've ever heard of.

Interview was very casual and has standard structured retail interview questions - a time you went 'above and beyond'/a challenge you've experienced and how you overcame it are the two where it might be good to have something prepped, otherwise best to have a talk about yourself and show that you're eager. They asked what I knew about Greggs already as well.

There's quite a strict protocol in terms of cleaning/cooking/uniform because it's a PLC, so maybe it would even be good to mention that you work best when there's a protocol/structure involved because then you know exactly what is required of you.

They're keen on hiring people who come across as being pleasant because that's what's expected at Greggs. They're also keen on expanding their employee demographic outside of 50 year old northern women (in London at least).

true,blitzballer,,Mellberg's Beard,"With the targetman out for the rest of the season, Villa recruited Grant Holt on loan from Wigan to provide cover for Christian Benteke up front with Nicklas Helenius out of favour.

But if Kozak continues to recover at his current rate, manager Paul Lambert expects to welcome back the 6ft 4in striker when the players return for training following their summer breaks.

“He’s doing great,” said Lambert.

“That’s him off the crutches now. I think he’s in a much happier place within himself now as well.

“The thing with Kozak is he’s a top boy so you know that with his rehabilitation he’ll knuckle down.

‘‘He’ll not cut any corners. He’ll have good days and bad days because of the mental stress of it but he will do his utmost to get fit.

“He’s on course. We’re hoping that pre season he’ll not be too far away. Libor is definitely doing well.

“He was down when the whole thing happened and for a few weeks after that.

Jores Okore is also making progress with his fitness as he recovers from a ruptured cruciate ligament and Lambert has not ruled out a playing return for the Danish defender this season.

He would have no hesitation using Okore during the current campaign, if he is fully fit, rather than saving him for next season, but admits the 21-year-old is still at least a month away from a comeback.

“I’ll have to wait and see,” said Lambert.

“He’s training with the fitness lads, but he’s not done any contact work or anything like that. If we can get him back and he’s feeling good then I think it’s right to give him some part of the game then I’ll look at it, but it could be another month.”",0,1395905173,null,0,false,0,cgd3qht,t3_21hluc,t1_cgd3qht,t3_21hluc,null,1433088969,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

He really knew almost nothing about any other technologies - suspect he'd followed an MS academic path into positions that were beyond his managerial abilities, and then leveraged them to take every training course available. 

But also the fiefdom suggestion is very perceptive of you: in unguarded moments he did express a desire to take over the CEO's position. He bloated his department, and made technology stipulations that were almost impossible to fulfil unless his department was further bloated. And turned it into a silo, physically and organisationally: he literally blocked off the entrances to his departmental offices, used the helpdesk as 'reception', and banned any parallel communications between his staff and those of any other department.

He was also a massive bully. Board meetings were awful, with him shouting over everyone, and once when there was an across-the-board pay cut imposed, he said in a full-company consultation meeting (in front of near-minimum-wage admin staff) said ""it's tough for me too, I've got two mortgages to pay and my SUV is really thirsty"".

It was very depressing indeed. Particularly because none of the other management had any technical knowledge, so I was a voice in the wilderness trying to point out how fucked-up the situation was and getting on everyone's tits about it.

It constitutes a direct attack by the nation's security services on the ability of the public to effectively communicate, and thus obstruct meaningful debate and dialogue. It is a direct attack on the public, communication, free exchange of ideas, and democracy itself.

Not to mention, these are the tactics of the Stasi. Match the info on the slides up with the following text from wikipedia;

&gt;The Stasi perfected the technique of psychological harassment of perceived enemies known as Zersetzung (pronounced [ʦɛɐ̯ˈzɛʦʊŋ]) – a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means ""decomposition"".
By the 1970s, the Stasi had decided that methods of overt persecution which had been employed up to that time, such as arrest and torture, were too crude and obvious. It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was, so its victims, and their supporters, were less likely to be provoked into active resistance, given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems, or even its exact nature. Zersetzung was designed to side-track and ""switch off"" perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any ""inappropriate"" activities.

&gt;Tactics employed under Zersetzung generally involved the disruption of the victim's private or family life. This often included psychological attacks such as breaking into homes and messing with the contents – moving furniture, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, purposely incorrect medical treatment, smear campaigns including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim's family, denunciation, provocation, psychological warfare, psychological subversion, wiretapping, bugging, mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a vibrator to a target's wife. Usually victims had no idea the Stasi were responsible. Many thought they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result.

I'd like to remind you that Switzerland is composed of a mere 8 million people as compared to UKs 65 million, and the demographics are completely different - leading it to be one the most racist countries in Europe.

*Swiss People's Party claims that Swiss communities have a democratic right to decide who can or cannot be Swiss. In addition, the report said ""Official statements and political campaigns that present immigrants from the EU in a favourable light and immigrants from elsewhere in a bad light must stop"", according to the Swiss Federal Statistics Office in 2006, 85.5% of the foreign residents in Switzerland are European. The United Nations special rapporteur on racism, Doudou Diène, has observed that Switzerland suffers from racism, discrimination and xenophobia. The UN envoy explained that although the Swiss authorities recognised the existence of racism and xenophobia, they did not view the problem as being serious. Diène pointed out that representatives of minority communities said they experienced serious racism and discrimination, notably for access to public services (e.g. health care), employment and lodging.*

The issues they vote on in their quarterly referendums are likely to be landslides either way, because the majority of people think the same way. Mob rule works for them, because they are all part of the same mob. This is why in 2009 they were able to ban the building of minarets on mosques ... because under their system, the muslim minorities concerns are drowned out.

Now imagine a system like that in UK, where the issues are not 99% in favour and 1% against ... more like 60% one side, 40% the other side. Should mob rule still decide every issue? Should 2 in 5 peoples voices, concerns, culture and traditions be ignored because 3 in 5 disagree?

Which means absolutely *nothing*.

Imagine the number of people who died who have eaten a McDonalds in the last month. Does that mean McDonalds is *solely* responsible? Of course not.

It may have been a contributing factor, although in this particular case I'm not convinced. ATOS claimed she was fit for work, and the inference made is because of her mental health issues she was unfit for work. But if you read what her *own* doctor said ...

That is a tangent to what is effectively describing a democratic deficit in the UK over the EU question.

For another example, the question of polls suggesting % in favour of a referendum is also matched by polls in favour of controlled-regulated immigration:

&gt;*Six in 10 unhappy with Government on immigration*

&gt;*72% thought that the British government took account of the 72% thought that the British government took account of the people’s views almost never
or only occasionally. 67% thought that Britain was already an over crowded island. Only 17% agreed that we need immigrants to meet skills shortages.people's views almost never*

&gt;*Immigration and asylum is now the TOP ISSUE facing the country with 56% selecting it.*

&gt;*70% say no to more migrants: Survey reveals public's concern*

Etc. That took all of 30 seconds to illustrate no matter what you say, the polls strongly indicate there is a democratic deficit in the UK that is too large between the represented MP's and their constituents.

But even more striking is the **length of time** this democratic deficit has been in both these issues: Referendum and Immigration. Why does that matter? Imo it matters a lot due to the politicians track-record of representation directly and for their competence in public office which should be measured and they should resign if they fail such competence tests. This would be closer if the government had accepted:

[Introduce a proper Recall mechanism for MPs](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/56449)

I wonder if Labour will sing the same tune when millions of their voters find out that every year their child benefit is going to decrease, those single parents who work part time are going to see their tax credits decrease and their housing benefit decrease. Meanwhile their bills go up, and their rent goes up. The underemployed will get shafted even harder, making it less financially less attractive to get a part time job. 

The welfare cap is a silly idea. You can't turn away people who are entitled to benefit so the only way to meet the budget will be to just decrease the amount you pay out to everyone year after year. With inflation outpacing wages and benefits, it isn't going to be a sustainable safety net for very long.

I doubt Cambridge will look twice at the IT certifications, and I doubt the knowledge you'd get on them would be relevant to the course either. Cambridge courses are very theoretical, and unless you've got a solid numerical background, you will struggle. I think a more realistic option (both in terms of getting in and making progress if you do get in) is to choose a more hands-on undergrad course, and if you do well at that, find a master's course which really specializing in what you are interested in.

Also - again, to be honest with you - many undergrad students I teach are ""a little lazy"", and that didn't stop them getting A's. I'd expect anyone who is Cambridge undergrad standard for a science to get an A at GCSE Maths even if they were more than a little lazy. Also - you are only 19. GCSEs were only 3 years ago.

true,chipshabit,null,null,"&gt; So I don't think it is controversial that religious institutions can't turn away people on racial grounds - but it becomes controversial when it comes to sexuality and/or gender.

Uncontroversial anti-discrimination laws are kind of pointless, though.  If a form of discrimination has become so rare that there is negligible opposition to banning it, then banning it won't make much difference.  The only case of a religious group in the UK attempting to discriminate on racial grounds in recent years that I can think of is [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%28E%29_v_Governing_Body_of_JFS), which was a bit silly all round.  Modern democracies seem to be very good at fighting yesterday's inequalities while ignoring the ones that are causing problems right now.

&gt; The Church of England is a bit more complicated as it is part of the state, so EU law and the HRA directly apply to it (in some cases). Hence the 'triple lock' in the same sex marriage law. Perhaps the solution there is to disestablish the CoE.

I thought the current situation is that the C of E is not considered to be a public body for these kinds of purposes.  Anyway, my understanding is that the C of E was excluded from the same-sex marriage law for constitutional reasons rather than worries about European law - changes to laws governing the church are, by convention, initiated by the General Synod, who clearly didn't want their church to be included (and, indeed, were strongly opposed to the law going ahead at all).

&gt; My impression is that the argument against same-sex marriage on the basis of EU or ECHR law is rather weak (particularly given the courts of both institutions have ruled against it in the past) - UKIP in particular seem to be using it as cover to avoid taking a position on same-sex marriage (they'll lose either way) while bashing anything European.

The argument seems completely absurd to me.  The ECtHR has ruled that trans people have a legal right to be able to marry someone of the opposite gender, and it is obvious that they would rule against a government that banned people of a particular religion from marrying.  However, there are many religious organisations that refuse to marry trans people, and many that refuse to marry members of other religions, and I have never heard any suggestion that this violates the ECHR or HRA.  When it comes to same-sex couples, the ECtHR has explicitly ruled that they *don't* have a right to get married, so how could they conceivably rule that religious organisations are not allowed to turn them away?

Even if the ECtHR were to rule that way, UKIP's argument is that to prevent religious organisations from being unable to carry out marriage ceremonies in the precise way they want to, an entire class of people should be banned from getting married altogether.

27 March 2014 -  Last updated at 10:19

&gt;Atos is to quit its contract to assess whether benefits claimants are fit to work, the government has announced.

&gt;It follows government criticism over ""significant quality failures"".

&gt;Disabilities Minister Mike Penning said a new company would be appointed in early 2015, and Atos would not receive ""a single penny of compensation"".

&gt;Atos, whose contract had been due to end in August 2015, had previously said it would carry on with the tests until a new company could be put in place.

&gt;Claimants applying for employment and support allowance must take a work-capability assessment to see how their disability or illness affects their ability to work.

&gt;Disability campaigners have described the work tests as ""ridiculously harsh and extremely unfair"".

&gt;Last summer, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) identified ""significant quality failures"" in the written reports Atos produced after tests and put a plan for improvement in place.

&gt;But in February, the DWP said standards had declined unacceptably.

&gt;Mr Penning said the government was looking for a provider to replace Atos ""with the view to increasing the number of assessments and reducing waiting times"".

&gt;He said: ""I am pleased to confirm that Atos will not receive a single penny of compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of their contract.

&gt;""Quite the contrary, Atos has made a substantial financial settlement to the department.""",0,1395917966,null,0,false,0,cgd5no8,t3_21hirl,t1_cgd5no8,t3_21hirl,null,1433089941,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

*The tested Tesla was filmed being pushed into the shed in order to show what would happen if the Roadster had run out of charge.*

So it never ran out of charge but due to Clarkson and his famous hated of electric cars they filmed a segment suggesting it did and when called on that they admitted they faked it.  It's a massively stupid thing to do as why not film petrol power cars being pushed off the track to demonstrate what might happen when you run out of petrol.

Top gear actually won the court case due to be it being acknowledged it’s a light entertainment program and not factual.  I don’t actually agree with that as the feature was presented as a review.  If something is a review it cannot feature faked faults in my mind.

That is why contract law is particularly complicated. 

&gt;But they can under the premise that they have engaged with companies during a time period they specifically agreed not to do so. 

No. You can't send a debt collector in this instance. You send a lawyer. The lawyer takes them to court and the court decides how much, *if anything* is owed. Then, and only then, if it's not paid a sherriff is sent to collect. 

&gt;They can also pursue this legally. 

Yes, via lawyers through court, where the clause will be challenged. 

&gt;a properly written contract of non-compete *is* enforceable provided some criteria are met. 

Christ, *anything* is enforceable given certain criteria.  The ""certain criteria"" is extremely difficult to prove and qualify. Making non-competes difficult to enforce and most of the time not worth pursuing. 

If you google anything, you'll always find an example which proves whatever point you're trying to make. Yes, there might be examples where non-compete clauses have been enforced, but 99/100 they are near impossible. 

I recommend you do not rely on google for legal advice. 

&gt;Telling OP otherwise puts them in legal danger and I'd question your wisdom in doing so. 

No it doesn't. OP is moving to a completely different country. 

Non-competes are only subject to reasonable geographical regions. 

So even if the rest of the clause was iron-tight the fact that he's moving to a different country entirely negates everything.

To my knowledge the Irish passport is the only passport in the world that lets you cross a US border before you leave the airport outside the US. In Dublin Airport there is a US passport control which means that once you leave the plane in actual US you don't have to go through their silly passport controls and can pretty much immediately leave the airport.

I've never actually done this myself so can't testify for it's efficiency or use but sounds cool. 

EDIT: Turns out it isn't an Irish passport but a per-cleareance at the airport within the country. Turns out some other places have it too.  ",1,1395921025,null,0,1395949536,0,cgd67t1,t3_21hvxh,t1_cgd67t1,t3_21hvxh,null,1433090246,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,benduder,null,null," I'm just about to enter my final term of studying Computer Science at Cambridge, so I should be able to answer any questions you have about the course itself (and yes, I did have to do the TSA exam), but I'm afraid none of the people I know have a similar story to you - most people have gone straight from school to university with good grades to back them up. Like another poster has said, I would be very surprised if you managed to get in with fewer than three A-levels, and Further Maths would definitely be the one to go for if you could manage to take up another one (although it is a big time commitment). 'Extra-curricular' achievements and awards would indeed be a good way to ameliorate your GCSE grades. There'd be no harm in putting your application off until you've sufficiently strengthened your educational background to have a good chance.

If you're applying to Cambridge as one of your five UCAS options then there's really no harm in doing so. There's a chance they'll value your time in employment and the fact that you've had some time to really think about what you want to do, rather than just following the traditional path of school -&gt; sixth form -&gt; university. You could even consider looking up one of the admissions tutors of a college you'd like to apply to and emailing them to see what they think.

Edit: One final thing I should add is that the course is very theoretical. It will probably be extremely different to anything you've encountered in employment and needs a good understanding of maths.

So what's the point of doing the ""fit-to-work"" programme and tests when you now have full access to the entire NHS GP database itself. It would be irrelevant right?

Hence why it has ""quit"" the programme now and the government giving it a positive spin. 

(From reddit-linked article)

&gt; Last summer, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) identified ""significant quality failures"" in the written reports Atos produced after tests and put a plan for improvement in place.

&gt; But in February, the DWP said standards had declined unacceptably.  
[The Minister of State for Disabled People] said the government was looking for a provider to replace Atos ""with the view to increasing the number of assessments and reducing waiting times"".

&gt; He said: ""I am pleased to confirm that Atos will not receive a single penny of compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of their contract.

&gt; ""Quite the contrary, Atos has made a substantial financial settlement to the department.""

Indeed.

It would be stupid to talk bad about a close partner such as Atos, I mean OH Assist (its new re-branded name). It would make the government look incompetent. 

http://mikesivier.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/a-thorn-by-any-other-name-atos-changes-to-oh-assist-business-as-usual/
 
Observers are waiting for the government to announce that Atos is providing a benefit to the health of the UK public and then they can begin the next stage of their plans.

As an extra note, some clues of what will happen and some quotes from the PM.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8934415/Call-for-council-diet-police-to-inspect-the-private-sector.html

&gt; Drastic action is needed to halt the cycle of ill health amid an alarming “sick note culture”, it found.

&gt; The report from 2020Health, a think tank, found that the economy is losing tens of billions of pounds in productivity because of a high number of sick days.

&gt; The report recommended the role of council “diet police” be increased to offer advice to the private sector. The authors said the proposals in the report, released today, would help reduce the “sick note culture”. 

[...]

&gt; [The Prime Minister] has warned that Britain's sicknote culture in the workplace was acting as a ""conveyor belt to a life on benefits"".

&gt; The Prime Minister said he would act on expert advice that recommended that family doctors should be stripped of the power to sign people off work long-term.

&gt; ""‘Of course some of these people genuinely can’t work, and we must support them. That’s only fair,"" the Prime Minister said.

&gt; ""But it’s also fair that those who can return to work should be supported to do so. We need to end the something for nothing culture.

&gt; ""‘While 90 per cent of sickness cases are short-term – that stomach bug or flu that we all suffer from occasionally – nearly half of all days lost to sickness absence are because of cases that last four weeks or more.""

&gt; Ministers believe that about one in five of those who are absent on long-term sick leave should either never have been signed off in the first place or could go back to work.

&gt; The expert report, commissioned for Downing Street, suggested more than three-quarters of GPs admitted they had signed people off sick for reasons other than their physical health.

&gt; [The PM] said he was alarmed by evidence of the scale of the problem from a report by Dame Carol Black, an expert on health at work, and David Frost, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.

Personally, I would think of some issues that actually interest you, and where you disagree with his stance and actually trying to think of some interesting, well informed questions, rather than simple trip-em-up type questions. 

So, for me interesting questions might be:

1. You have only voted against your party's position on 1% of occasions.   MPs blind adherence to party whip has been repeatedly shown to be a factor in people's disillusion with party politics. What can we do to reform the house of commons to introduce more real debate and give MPs the freedom to assess policies on merit?

Please, look at it from a non-biased point of view. A big part of the reason why /r/soccer hates us Chelsea fans so much is because of constant 2009 match vs Barca complaints. Once again, yes it was unfair and one-sided. Once again, I am on YOUR side, I'm not a Spurs, Arsenal, Man Utd,  or Liverpool fan . And once again, I wish it wouldn't have happened the way it did. But at the end of the day, referee mistakes or not, we failed to put the ball in the back of the net. It's that simple. That's the way football works: the team that scores the most goals wins. Making excuses and trying to justify why we lost is childish, and yes, I still think it is being a sore-loser.

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"&gt; he's shown himself to be just as stubborn and less knowledgeable.

Not at all, where the fuck are you getting this from? He's not been stubborn, changed his tactics to counter other teams and play in certain styles against specific teams.

Less knowledgeable. I'm guessing this is coming from not understanding things such as heavily stacking the central midfield (which has allowed us to dominate in midfield games such as vs Newcastle) and things such as playing Eriksen on the left (despite the fact he's been at his most effective for us there and has played there several times for Denmark. Add to that the fact that a lot of our alternatives there have been not brilliant left wingers, in all honesty).

Now other things you might be able to criticise him for tactically include not playing a more strict DM against stronger sides but tbh, that's mostly been due to Sandro's injury and I've not felt that Capoue's offered that much more protection for our defence than Bentaleb which is shit because he's clearly stronger and a better tackler than Bentaleb.

The only thing I would criticise him for tactically is keeping AVB's high line as it's causing us a lot of problems still yet it hasn't been changed. I initially thought that this was due to the fact that changing a defensive system midway through a season is risky but it's got to the point where it's causing too many problems not to be altered.

But that's only a defensive issue which has stuck with us, he has managed us tactically to provide us winning more games and scoring more goals. So offensively his tactics have clearly come off, possibly simply by virtue of introducing counter-attacking into our tactics (another thing AVB was incapable of doing).

You also may 

&gt; And in we win top four, it will be because we beat a bunch of teams we were supposed to beat, and Arsenal collapsed hilariously.

this shows clear bias against Sherwood, with no reason.

Even with a collapse from other teams, we'd need to pick up seriously high levels of points and that would come from good management from Sherwood. If Wenger/Rodgers/Mourinho can't pick up points against lower teams but Sherwood gets us to, then that's from his good management, and don't try and take that from him (before it's even happened, no less).

&gt; he was an opposition scout for Mourinho for fucks sake

this tells me he can note down oppositions tactics (fine if he's our opposition scout, not our manager), but he showed with us an inability to react to other people's tactics, therefore tactically inept.

Also I'd like to add as a final point that I hoped for AVB to have more time, so I've got nothing against the man, I'm just judging him for what he did at the club is all.",0,1395924868,null,0,false,0,cgd75bk,t3_21fd9w,t1_cgd75bk,t1_cgd6vcg,null,1433090811,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,AidanSmeaton,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"&gt; Salmond says that it's to our benefit to adopt a shared currency, and therefore that's what we'll do.

Well, he's right. You have to remember that the Treasury is politically affiliated with Westminster parties (George Osborne is Tory, Danny Alexander is LibDem, Ed Balls is Labour) - and Salmond is politically affiliated with the SNP. When it comes to economics, we need to be as impartial as possible.

The Fiscal Commissions Working Group was set up by the Scottish Government to provide an impartial analysis on the currency options available for Scotland. This study was undertaken by world renowned economists with no political affiliation, including two Nobel Laureates. A currency union came out on top. I'm sure Salmond would have much prefered a new Scottish currency or the Euro, but he's got the decency and integrity to accept the facts in the report he was given.

A summary of the report has been published here: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00419554.pdf

I think we're all savvy enough to smell political bullshit, and it's quite clear that Westminster's blank refusal to agree to a currency union pre-referendum will change after the votes have been counted. It's just politics, we've seen it all before. When leading economists say a currency union is the best option for Scotland *and* the UK, I'm inclined to believe them and that it will go ahead. In the wake of the vote, I find it hard to believe that the Bank of England would cut off their nose to spite their face.

To quote Professor David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee:

&gt; *There are clearly things to be worked out but a lot of this sounds like political posturing rather than economics. It is hard to argue that in fiscal terms, under this union, Scotland could have possibly done worse than UK Chancellor George Osborne has done and the evidence is that actually Scotland has been doing better. So we have to get the economics right.*

Bear in mind that Scotland's GDP per capita is far greater than the rest of the UK's ($47k vs $37k). There are many reasons why Westminster want to keep Scotland in the union, and we should be skeptical of everyone's motives.",0,1395925400,null,0,false,0,cgd7b1k,t3_21fpg1,t1_cgd7b1k,t1_cgcn9e7,null,1433090886,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,backtowriting,null,null,"First off, let's be clear:  both the left and the right are responsible for attacks on free speech.  The desire to censor views you disagree with is an instinct which is practically a universal across all ideologies and all people.  Just look at responses to the common askreddit question: ""What would you most like to see banned on reddit"".  People from all political persuasions are eager to fantasize about how they would control and limit discussion given the chance.

Having said that, I too find it disgraceful that the left has been so willing to endorse attacks on free speech with such little self-questioning.  There are now laws against 'hate speech' in multiple 'liberal' nations and of course there are the endless boycotts against anything the left happens to disagree with.  The campaigns to ban Page 3 and to remove The Sun from campus shops spring to mind.

Of course, now I have to deal with the oft repeated claim that it's not a violation of free-speech to organize a boycott, or indeed, to call for a candidate's deselection because of his failure to find a cartoon offensive.  

Yes, you have the legal right to boycott organizations or to call for people to be fired because they expressed some view you dislike and so on.  But, what you're in effect trying to do is to use political pressure to shut people up.  To take away their ability to express dissenting or unpopular opinions.

So what do I think you should do when a person says something you find 'offensive'?

i) Ignore them.  This is often a very good strategy.  If you don't like a book in a library, then don't read it.

ii) Challenge them.  Put forward your own argument.  Explain why you think they're wrong.  Use debate.  Do what we do on Reddit.  The best counter to a bad argument is a good argument.

But also, I think people are forgetting that we all have a right to an opinion.  I'm wary of creating a society where nobody wants to express any opinion, because it might ultimately get them fired.  We need to be able to discuss controversial ideas and to understand that it's impossible to do so without sometimes causing offense.",0,1395926409,null,0,false,0,cgd7mlp,t3_21hydj,t1_cgd7mlp,t3_21hydj,null,1433091037,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Who does it apply too?  How poor?  Bottom quartile?

So assuming you mean people are starving, I assume you are happy with the amount of people who have access to safe drinking water.

But in relation to those who are on minimum wage, then frankly, yes, having lower price luxury items is a good thing, it's a better lifestyle for less.

Now you say that people can't feed themselves, the problem is what is the data points we are using to compare and contrast this?

If we look at inequality via say GINI we see it is now trending downwards, despite trending upwards since 2010.  So no, I see no crisis there.

If we take some ONS data:
http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/life-in-the-uk--2014/rft---national-well-being-measures--march-2014.xls

I see a trending upwards in satisfaction and slight drop in anxiety.

So if you are saying there is a crisis, that is effecting only the bottom end of society, that is related to what exactly?  As elsewhere on this thread I was commenting how both CPI and RPI are trending down, whilst median wage up, would suggest that today's crisis is much less than yesterdays.

If people are starving then they are not showing up in the mortality figures by ONS, health and life expectancy etc.

Sadly I don't know of any accurate data sources that deal with such a thing before its death.  However, we've seen a rise in foodbanks, but given that under Labour job centres were advised against referring people to them, it is hard to say if that is due to a change in personal circumstances (ie getting worse) or just people being more aware of the help on offer.

I think securing top three is important for the automatic CL qualification, but if you gave me the choice of result I'd be completely behind gambling a top three position for a shot at the title.

Would like to hope that we can pull out the stops and get two wins against City and Chelsea at Anfield, but I'm still fairly sure we'll slip up somewhere else and drop a few points between now and the end of the season. I think Chelsea and City almost certainly will too, but I'd rather we weren't already behind on paper when we drop points.

It feels a bit like a penalty shoot-out. You know someone on the other team is probably going to miss one as well, but you'd rather its the other team that slips up first because mistakes are so much easier to live with when you're not already behind. If we drop two or three points this weekend and Chelsea/City don't, then it suddenly feels like we've lost the title race even though in reality we're still right in it.

Either way if someone had told me 6-12 months ago we'd be in 2nd place and a point off 1st at this point in the season I'd have said they were dreaming and way too optimistic.

Injuries, squad rotation, heavy fixture list, and maybe sitting a player out of form for a bit are all reasons I'm for bringing in some elite talent that IF (because we still have work to do) we are a Champions League team we should be able to do. 

Now I get we all have attachments to players on the squad and rightfully so but I'm all for bringing in some great players even if that's going to push some of the regulars now. Competition can't be a bad thing right? 

I think we can bring back Suso and Borini, but I'd probably sell Assaidi, look to sell Aspas, loan Ilori and Alberto out. I'll say my one caveat in this is Ibe.

true,energyi,null,null,"Sounds like snobbery to me, looking down on British managers in favour of someone more exotic. It's very annoying how they are written off and looked down on (and yes I know our media does this too and that infuriates me).

Mancini was awful at City considering their resources and how weak the teams around them were at the time. Chelsea, United, Arsenal and Liverpool all had infeior squads to City so in my opinion Mancini was a crap manager for that level. He should have done more with that team.

Frank De Boer seems ok but he has a lot to prove too and we have no reason to believe he would be a success in England. He does have the best squad in the Eredivisie so it's hard to judge how good he acutally is. Does seem like a good candidate but could always be another AVB.

I don't know enough about Spaletti but he seemed to do ok at Roma? Why did he get fired from Zenit?

LvG does seem like a great coach but he isn't young and there's a good chance we simply can't get him.

Why do you think managers like Hughton or Bruce aren't alright? They are good managers. It annoys me when managers like Hughton get looked down on simply because they are British. It was only recently that Laudrup was hailed as someone on his way to a big club (maybe us) and now look at Swansea. Norwich are better with Hughton in charge. I know there are other factors to consider but my point is that an overhyped foreign manager isnt necessarily better than some of the British managers around. 

Don't forget how few resources managers of clubs like Hull and Norwich have compared to Spurs. 

Regarding Sherwood. The fact is at the moment he has us playing. 1st hour against Chelsea, most of the game vs the scum and away at Benfica we looked very good. I was worried a few weeks ago that the dressing room didn't respct him but I genuinely think his rant a gave them the kick up the arse they needed and at the very least we are seeing massive effort from the team. We aren't up to our 'Arry, Modric, Bale &amp; VDV standard but Sherwood has made zero signings yet and came in mid season, he cannot be fairly judged until he has had a chance to build a team.

true,smokey815,num11,,"Stubborn in forcing Eriksen out to the left where he has been less effective himself, and also been detrimental to our defensive shape.  This when we had Chadli, who has been great for at least the last month, and was never in worse form than players Timmy chose to field over him.  Playing the high line with no pressure in midfield, too.  Going from a 442 to a weird, misshapen 4411 doesn't get much love from me.

And no, Eriksen is not most effective on the left.  He may not be worse off offensively, but that's because he plays in the center, even when fielded on the left.  But like I said above, I can't even begin to understand why he would think it's a good idea.  Not only is Danny Rose inconsistent and mostly unable to make up the width we lack when Eriksen plays as an additional center mid, we crowd ourselves out of the center of the pitch.  And when we have Chadli, a very, very versatile player who can play several roles when fielded on the left flank, it makes even less sense.  He's been in solid form nearly all year, and great form the last month or so.  No idea why it took this long for him to start, and no idea why he's not played on the left.

As for scoring more goals and winning more games, I'd put far more of it on just simply not being an idiot and bringing Ade back.  Newcastle wasn't a tactical masterpiece.  He played five center mids in a blob.  Krul gifted us two goals, and Newcastle were poor in attack.  We're not playing with any more urgency or speed, barring a the second half of our last two matches.  And we're just finishing better.  That's the main difference.  We couldn't finish under AVB, and under Timmy we're doing a better job.

As for that last point, I'm not sure why you're harping on it so much.  I imply said that I don't think Tim is doing all that much to help.  It's not that he's hurting us, I just don't think he's doing anything particularly special.  I also don't think he'll suddenly start in the next two months, either.  If he does, then good for him, I would be happy to see him stay.  If he suddenly start playing players in their right roles, countering the opposition tactics, getting the team to attack and defend as a unit from the first whistle, then he deserves to stay.  All that I'm saying is I don't expect him to.  That's not a bias against Sherwood, though you seem to think it is.  That's just me being unimpressed with what he's done so far and not expecting him ti fix it all so soon.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; I know it is a bit early to you know talk transfers with the matters at hand but I just was wondering why there seems to be this feeling about being scared to ad competition for places to the squad. Seems like people want us to bring in just depth and not really bring in players that can change the starting 11. 

Because we have a finite budget and players that will slip straight into our first XI are expensive. We don't have many players in the squad we'd want to sell and would get good money for, and realistically we're unlikely to be spending more than £50-60m in the transfer window. We could spend all that on two or three big name players to strengthen the first team, but I'd rather we add six or seven players to the side that can give us a solid bench, and some solid backup options for when we have injuries or need to rest players for big games. 

We've already shown this season that our first XI is good enough to compete head-to-head with the likes of Chelsea and City - the issue is with having good options on the bench, and having a second XI that can still go out there and beat most of the lesser PL sides. There aren't any places I'd say we're desperately in need of signing a better player because our current first-choice isn't good enough (maybe LB if Enrique is going to continue to be injured). But there are plenty where I'd say our second choices are nowhere near good enough to play in big games if we need them to. Spending big to push one or two of our current side into that second XI doesn't make sense compared to spending to strengthen that second XI in five or six places. 

It's not that I don't want to unsettle the current players or add competition. It's just that I'd rather we bought four more players around Borini's level than spending £40m all on one Juan Mata.

At the beginning of the game we were passing, attacking, and making shots in a way that I haven't seen in a while, but that all stopped when we went one nil up and suddenly we were defending ridiculously deep against a weakened side to whom we had just been giving a lot of trouble. This just gave Hull chances, and in turn knocked the confidence of the players and frustrated the fans.

Let's take an extreme example. Some jerk might be motivated to attend an open meeting of a women's group and call their black, disabled organiser a ""cr--ple n--ger sl-t"".

I hope most Redditors agree that in the example above, the woman's right to be safe from abuse trumps the jerk's right to free speech. In other words there is a limit to free speech and the jerk's behaviour is way beyond that line.

Where people differ is where line, between free speech and safety from abuse, is drawn in less extreme circumstances. A particular bone of contention is on which side of that line blasphemy sits.

So it's not necessarily that people are failing to defend free speech, but that people disagree about how far it goes before it conflicts with other people's rights.

&gt; **Why Everton should be punished for their loan signings**


&gt; Everton deserved their victory over the Magpies at St James’ Park but the flattering scoreline highlighted the growing problem of loan players in today’s Premier League.

&gt; Newcastle United are no stranger to the loan market and it’s no secret we struggle to convert chances, as we did in the Everton loss, without leading goal scorer and short-term striker Loic Remy from QPR on the pitch.

&gt; The Toon also brought in Luuk De Jong in January to reinforce the forward line, although based on the last night’s showing, it’s unlikely we’ll be following up interest in the Dutchman long-term.

&gt;Going into the game the two sides looked closely matched but by the final whistle it was clear there was a huge gulf in quality. The pace and skill of Gerard Deulofeu caused problems for Yoan Gouffran and Paul Dummett down the left-flank all night. The power of Romelu Lukaku bullied the Toon’s beleaguered defence from the first whistle.

&gt;In the middle, England international Gareth Barry picked out the forward thinking Ross Barkley and the Everton attack time and time again. On-loan Chelsea striker, Lukaku is one of this season’s stand out strikers and has found the net 12 times with a record of a goal every other game.

&gt;Deulofeu, on-loan from Barcelona no less, played a part in all three goals and was a constant threat against the Toon. Barry, on-loan from Manchester City, was a stablising presence in the Everton centre-midfield and arguably allowed the marauding Barkley the freedom to destroy the Magpies’ defence in the manner he did for the opening goal.

&gt;A third of Everton’s starting line-up were on-loan players from the world’s elite clubs and their whole team is built around them.

&gt;The victory wasn’t exclusively down to these three starters but they all played a huge part in the win and almost certainly made the difference on the night.

&gt;Take nothing away from Roberto Martinez. The Spaniard is proving to be more than capable of filling David Moyes shoes at Goodison Park – and was irritatingly endearing in the way he praised the Toon players for their efforts in Alan Pardew’s enforced absence before kick-off.

&gt;But without Lukaku, a world-class striker who would be beyond Everton financially if they were to attempt a full transfer from Chelsea, as well as Deulofeu and Barry, the Toffees wouldn’t be anywhere near a Champions League spot.

&gt;Other clubs have players on loan, Newcastle included, but none have had greater impact than at Everton.

&gt;The Football Association need to address the Premier League loan system to stop it having an adverse affect on the table.

EDIT: Not even a minute of googling and I have this parliamentary document from 2010 specifying:

&gt;In the UK data suggest that from 1997 to 2009 6.8% of primary legislation (Statutes) and 
14.1% of secondary legislation (Statutory Instruments) had a role in implementing EU 
obligations, although the degree of involvement varied from passing reference to explicit 
implementation. -  http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62.pdf

From section five, same document:

&gt;Based on data from the UK Statute Law database, from 1980 to the end of 2009, out of 
1,302 UK Acts between 1980 and 2009 (excluding those later repealed), 186 Acts or 14.3% 
incorporated a degree of EU influence.

TLDR; Order-Order can go and get fucked.

EDIT 2: More hilarity - that 50% figure in the article is based on a fucking terrible set of assumptions - instead of actually measuring the number of laws passed, the HoCL *just took a look at how much fucking shelf space the books on EU law occupied - without checking if those books laws were actually applied in the UK.*

&gt;Before EU statistics were available electronically, the House of Commons Library attempted 
to answer the question frequently asked by Members of Parliament about the amount of EC 
legislation by measuring the shelf-space occupied by 
the bound ‘L’ series (legislation) of the Official Journal 
of the European Communities (OJL). An estimate of 
the proportion this formed of national legislation was 
calculated by comparing the OJ shelf measurement 
with the shelf-space occupied by bound volumes of 
UK Acts and SIs. However, this was a crude and very 
rough guide, as the length and presentation of the two 
types of instruments are very different; also, the ‘L’ 
volumes contain the texts of all EC legislation, whether or not laws apply in the UK.

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"&gt; Stubborn in **forcing Eriksen out to the left where he has been less effective himself**, and also been detrimental to our defensive shape. This when we had Chadli, who has been great for at least the last month, and was never in worse form than players Timmy chose to field over him.

I'm making some assumptions here but I'm gonna go ahead and guess that Chadli preffered to play in CAM, rather than it being a case of wanting a big man in the middle, because you tend to go for a small support striker/playmaker in behind anyways. Last game that is.

Secondly Chadli's had a few good performances recently, but it's only been about 3 games, the rest he's been pretty average and whilst this isn't too bad, it's nothing to make it clear he should be starting on the left wing, especially a few months ago.

&gt; Going from a 442 to a weird, misshapen 4411 doesn't get much love from me.

These have been quite effective at times, but I'm not surprised it doesn't get much love from you.

&gt; And no, Eriksen is not most effective on the left. He may not be worse off offensively, but that's because he plays in the center, even when fielded on the left.

He plays centrally-ish but if you look at his average position he's been on the left side. Moving about and varying position is good and can leave you unmarked and open up space, so I've no problem with Eriksen coming inside, he seems to do it better than Sigurdsson anyway.

&gt; Not only is Danny Rose inconsistent and mostly unable to make up the width we lack when Eriksen plays as an additional center mid, we crowd ourselves out of the center of the pitch.

I agree he is inconsistent since coming back from injury but he does seem to mostly be able to make up for the lack of width, not fully as inverted wingers will always lose more width than traditional, but he makes up for the most part. I don't find we crowd ourselves out in the middle, there tends to be enough space in games, I can't really explain it there just seems to be more space, maybe it's part of playing more attacking, idk.

It took so long for Chadli to start because he had a load of mediocre performances, and wasn't showing himself to be a better left winger than Siggy, who's not great at the role either.

&gt; Newcastle were poor in attack.

That was due to Sherwood's tactics, he crowded the middle, Newcastle couldn't get through and we were able to control the game. Now Newcastle weren't very good, but to not credit the manager for a 4-0 win is just spiteful.

&gt; And we're just finishing better. That's the main difference.

No we're creating more chances because we're counter-attacking, we're getting more width in and we're opening up the pitch more. We're taking less pot-shots due to AVB's slow style and are attacking the opposition which is leading to more chances. Soldado's still missing a shit ton, and Ade's obviously scoring now, but our chance creation is up (and by that I don't mean our pot-shot's out of the area are up).

&gt; I imply said that I don't think Tim is doing all that much to help.

Sounds like you're underestimating how hard football management is. I mean maybe what you mean is that he's just the average football manager in the football league. The base standard. He's doing better than AVB, so by that logic AVB's gotta be below the base standard for football league management. *Ouch.*

&gt; I also don't think he'll suddenly start in the next two months, either. If he does, then good for him, I would be happy to see him stay.

There isn't a scenario where I see you being able to say that he'll stay because you won't credit him for winning, unless he does it **the way you want him to do it**. There's more than one way of winning a football match, and just because he's not playing the players you want where you want, doesn't mean it's not being effective and you shouldn't credit the manager. Your way isn't necessarily right (in fact it almost certainly isn't).

&gt; If he suddenly start playing players in their right roles, countering the opposition tactics, getting the team to attack and defend as a unit from the first whistle, then he deserves to stay

Funilly enough I think he's already doing this. Not amazingly, granted, but he clearly is already doing this.

&gt; That's just me being unimpressed with what he's done so far and not expecting him ti fix it all so soon.

I don't expect him to get top 4, which is ultimately what will decide if he stays or not, but what you seem to be talking about is if he manages the way you want him to. Which is: do the obvious things I think should be done. The obvious things you think should be done aren't necessarily what's required to win a football match.

It might come across as me absolving all blame from him, it's not what I intend, but I say, judge him on his results and performances, not what tactics you think he should be doing because what you reckon should be going on ain't necessarily what's needed.

He's obviously not got things perfect, but he's done a decent job and doesn't deserve to be labelled as someone without tactics and who doesn't have a plan.

I'm not saying that it's a perfectly ethical way to do things, but it's undoubtedly effective. A lot of modern advertising businesses and search engines are based on similar mass data analysis, and while others may dislike googles data policies, I think them having some of my data and sell it to advertising companies is worth their ability to find the results I want.

Regardless, the methodology of data gathering hasn't really changed. Traditionally intelligence agencies hired actual people to go hang out with hippies at festivals and infiltrate their ranks to find out if somebody is going to set an animal testing lab on fire. Or having some people join the EDL to try and find out information about any provocative marches/racist attacks they might be planning. Instead of that, they just make some friends on facebook... I really don't get what the difference is. Just like physical spies don't give a shit if you're going about your ever day business around them, the vast majority of the information gathered from facebook is ignored as well.

As for Kevin Bacon, I meant six! [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon), is based on the statistical likelihood that any person can be connected to any other person in at most 6 steps. The Kevin Bacon version is that you connect him to another actor by naming films that other people have been in. My point was that starting with random every day people, you can within 6 steps become friends with somebody that will give intelligence agencies useful information.

**CHELSEA**

* Stoke(H) - Beat Chelsea 3-2 at the Brittania. Decent team showing good form and spirit against top sides.
* Swansea (A) - Looking unlikely due to their recent form and league position but Swansea are a capable side. Maybe a draw.
* Liverpool (A) - A bruising loss at fortress Anfield, fingers crossed.

**LIVERPOOL**

* Tottenham (H) - Confidence is high especially at home, and with reason, but let's not forget that Tottenham are a top side with capable players who can scrape a 1-0 victory with an adebayor tap-in or a Soldado penalty. Who are we kidding though, 5-0 again please boys!
* Chelsea &amp; Man City (H) - Included together as it's the same story with both. Yes they are travelling to Anfield where Sturridge is waiting to punish his former clubs for letting him go, but there is a reason THEY are the title challengers and we are the surprise package. The points can fall anywhere in these two cracking fixtures. Hopefully to the reds.

**MAN CITY**

* Arsenal (A) - Arsenal will be wanting to redeem their recent (yearly) slump in form. Top sides clashing, hopefully Arsenal take the points.
* Southampton (H) - Saints riding high this season, hold their own against top sides even if they don't get the result. Our 3-0 victory was flattering. Could cause an upset.
* Liverpool (A) - [*see Chelsea - Bullet point 3*]
* Everton (A) - Our Merseyside neighbours could definitely do us a favour here. Roberto 'More Tactical Than Moyes' Martinez could orchestrate a welcome victory or draw.
* Aston Villa (H) - A side with shaky form but strong against the top guns. Beat Chelsea, could do the same to City.

All in all seems Chelsea have the easiest run in of fixtures but if Liverpool beat the other 2 at Anfield, we become more than just dark horses.

I love this sub though, even just being in the background reading what everyone has to say is a lot of fun.  I'm having a tough go of things right now.  The following is probably going to be pretty convoluted and I'm sorry for unleashing it all on this awesome sub.  I think I had to let it out eventually and for some reason seeing this thread compelled me to do so.  A month ago one of the outlets in my apartment burst into flames at like 1AM (and no I didn't have too much stuff plugged into it...) nearly killing me.  I somehow happened to be awake to put the fire out, but I'm rarely ever awake that late when I to work the next day and if I wasn't then that could well have been the end.  My grandfather died.  My father is dealing with some insane ass breakup that's turned into a series of court cases about who stole money from who so he's bent out of shape and he's a pretty lonely, miserable dude who's burned way too many bridges in the past few years, so I'm basically all he's got so I'm shouldering a lot of the load there.  And then a couple of weeks ago my (ex)GF of 2 years broke up with me.  I'm going to elaborate on my breakup because while I think I've handled the rest pretty well and stayed strong, this one put the knife in pretty deep and I'm all out of sorts because of it.

The end came out of nowhere and the way she did it, plus the reasoning, were both hugely disrespectful.  First, she did it over Facebook and I don't know what kind of person ends a 2+ years relationship via FACEBOOK of all ways (I think even a text message would've hurt less... well maybe not it's hard to say) but that person is not a considerate human being at all.  Second, her reasoning basically boils down to me not being wealthy.  She's from an insanely privileged family (like the kind where money isn't stopping her from doing anything she wants be it flying around the world, buying a horse, not having to pay for her own college at a massively expensive IV league school, etc etc).  I've had to work my ass off for everything I have.  I'm doing pretty fucking well for myself too, making more than double the average income for a person my age (I'm 26) in a very stable job that has massive room to advance, with my only debt being student loans.  I'm on my way to my dreams and living a pretty comfortable, exciting life along the way.  I've been through a lot of shit in the past 6-8 years (she knows and has known since before we started dating since we used to be friends first) but I came out of it all swinging and ready to win.  

I've been struggling hard with this.  I really thought I was doing well and becoming pretty successful at this point.  I want nothing to do with her after how and why she ended things, she's clearly selfish and disrespectful.  I can't fathom doing that to another person, so I don't really want the sort of person who is capable of it in my life.  Plus her opinion of me can't be very high if she would end a serious long relationship via fucking Facebook, of all possible ways to communicate.  It feels like she was just slumming it with me for a couple of years or something (which is bizarre because I'd hardly call my situation ""slumming"" by any stretch)... I mean why spend 2 years with someone only to just nuke it because of money when you knew their financial situation all along? 

It hurts that she left, and it hurts why she left.  But the thing that's really killing me is how I took her words to heart.  I'm questioning everything about myself now.  I thought I was becoming rather successful and well set up.  My friends and family who know about my past think I'm absolutely kicking ass, they're all so proud of me.  Yet her singular opinion has changed all of that, I feel like shit now, like I'm not doing well with my life. I know I shouldn't be bothered like this so being upset just pisses me off more.

Bash the panic button on my radio. Launch the nearest object (baby monitor, vase) at the guy, lift the drying horse and use it to create distance between myself and the knife wielding guy with a view to egress the property.

You could argue that you should talk the guy into putting his knife down, then securing him with handcuffs but that's time consuming and (IMO) has a higher chance of failure than hoofing it out of the room. It has the most desirable outcome, but also has the highest risk of everything going to shit.

The priority of rescue once outside would be the officer, followed by the baby. The officer is a known quantity; his location is known, and has a higher demand for treatment. The baby is in an unknown location, and its requirement for rescue is unquantified.

true,Ehrfurcht,,Is Kozak still living?,"Q1) I think Moyes was put into a very difficult position; while he hasn't performed like anyone expected, it rarely helps clubs to swap managers with two months left.

Q2) I think you'll finish 6th after Spurs continue to fall. I think Bayern will absolutely murder you (or win big in the first game, then allow a draw in the second).

Q3) The fans should place a bit of the blame on the players. Like seriously, Moyes isn't the one who isn't trying on the pitch; Rooney seems to be the only one giving a damn.

Q4) He's been fine. He was out of form coming off of an injury, but that's to be expected of anyone. I can't picture him being a regular starting XI if he moves to a bigger club. Also, I think Villa will make someone overpay to get him (this summer at least).

Q5) I like Bertrand; he wasn't that great against Stoke, but I hope we make it permanent.

Q6) Lambert does well with what he's given; he is setting us up for the long term with all of the youngsters. I'm not sure about *establishing* us in the top half though, that will take money (besides like, seventh or eighth).

Q7) Yes and no. Yes because it reminds me of the successes. No because it reminds me of how we aren't there now.

Q8) Jack Grealish seems to be doing rather well at Notts County. I have high hopes for a breakthrough season next year for Helenius or Kozak.

Q9) Best: Lambert somehow getting Benteke to extend his contract. Worst (or lack thereof): Not signing a real midfield presence.

Q10) Same that we had against Stoke, but Clark in for Baker. Guzan; Bacuna, Vlaar, **Clark**, Bertrand; El Ahmadi, Westwood, Delph; Weimann, Benteke, Agbonlahor. Just heard **El Ahmadi** is doubtful for Saturday, a start for **Albrighton**?! 

Q11) My rather hopeful prediction: 0-1. Man United has possession the entire game, but can't find a way to score. Then we get a successful counter: Long boot from Guzan to Benteke's head that finds Delph or Gabby.

 Obviously, it feels strange to be on the moral high ground but I feel a response is required to the BBC Trust's cowardly rebuke of my jokes about Palestine.

As always, I heard nothing from the BBC but read in a newspaper that editorial procedures would be tightened further to stop jokes with anything at all to say getting past the censors.

In case you missed it, the jokes in question are:

""I've been studying Israeli Army Martial Arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back.

""People think that the Middle East is very complex but I have an analogy that sums it up quite well. 







""If you imagine that Palestine is a big cake, well... that cake is being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew.""

I think the problem here is that the show's producers will have thought that Israel, an aggressive, terrorist state with a nuclear arsenal was an appropriate target for satire.

The Trust's ruling is essentially a note from their line managers.

It says that if you imagine that a state busily going about the destruction of an entire people is fair game, you are mistaken. Israel is out of bounds.

The BBC refused to broadcast a humanitarian appeal in 2009 to help residents of Gaza rebuild their homes.

It's tragic for such a great institution but it is now cravenly afraid of giving offence and vulnerable to any kind of well drilled lobbying.

I told the jokes on a Radio 4 show called ""Political Animal"". That title seems to promise provocative comedy with a point of view.

In practice the BBC wish to deliver the flavour of political comedy with none of the content.

The most recent offering I saw was BBC2's ""The Bubble"".

It looked exactly like a show where funny people sat around and did jokes about the news.

Except the thrust of the format was that nobody had read the papers.

I can only imagine how the head of the BBC Trust must have looked watching that, grinning like Gordon Brown having his prostate examined.

The situation in Palestine seems to be, in essence, apartheid.

I grew up with the anti apartheid thing being a huge focus of debate.

It really seemed to matter to everybody that other human beings were being treated in that way.

We didn't just talk about it, we did things, I remember boycotts and marches and demos all being held because we couldn't bear that people were being treated like that.

A few years ago I watched a documentary about life in Palestine.

There's a section where a UN dignitary of some kind comes to do a photo opportunity outside a new hospital.

The staff know that it communicates nothing of the real desperation of their position, so they trick her into a side ward on her way out.

She ends up in a room with a child who the doctors explain is in a critical condition because they don't have the supplies to keep treating him.

She flounders, awkwardly caught in the bleak reality of the room, mouthing platitudes over a dying boy.

The filmmaker asks one of the doctors what they think the stunt will have achieved.

He is suddenly angry, perhaps having just felt at first hand something he knew in the abstract. The indifference of the world.

""She will do nothing,"" he says to the filmmaker. Then he looks into the camera and says: ""Neither will you"".

I cried at that and promised myself that I would do something. Other than write a few stupid jokes I have not done anything. Neither have you.

I did something similar on my CBT. 

Everything was going well and I had almost completed the ride out and was leading the group back to the test centre. Sat in the middle of a busy road waiting to turn right and it was taking *forever* for the traffic to clear. I think I was being a little overly cautious though and there were spaces I could have nipped through, so realising this I decided I was going to go quickly (as quick as a CB125 can go) across and wait for the rest. 

So I see a gap, get some revs and start to slip the clutch... then when my time comes I released the clutch too quickly, ride really wide with my legs flailing then up the curb and along a length of pavement and almost into the wall of the local police station. Luckily I didn't actually hit anything or anyone but it was damn scary. 

We pulled up and everyone had a good laugh at my expense, rode back to the centre and we all passed (amazingly!).

Not me!  You have a right to exclude that person from the meeting, but it should still be protected free-speech.

In my book, you *don't* have a right not to be offended.  

If we limit free speech to what isn't offensive, we will very quickly find that religious conservatives will crawl out of the woodwork claiming to be offended about practically everything.  In fact, that's already happening.

It's easy to conjure up nightmares about free-speech but you are overlooking the fact that free-speech also gives *protection* to disadvantaged minorities and those who wish to express unpopular opinions.  One of the best ways to help the oppressed is to give them the maximum freedom to express their ideas, no matter how much those ideas may be disliked.",0,1395939639,null,0,false,0,cgddkzu,t3_21hydj,t1_cgddkzu,t1_cgdals5,null,1433093843,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
