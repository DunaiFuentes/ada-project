Even some of the larger non-league clubs (the fifth tier and below) average figures in the thousands.

To try and understand the mentality, this might be a good place to start: http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/sports/supporting-a-football-team.html

I'm looking for actual statistics and drawing a blank, but I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that most men in England support a football team to some degree, and a growing percentage of women, as clubs are making more and more of an effort to become women and family-friendly. At one end of the scale you will have fans who go to every game, home and away- away travel seems to be much, much more common than with American Football, presumably due to cost and geography. At the other end of the scale, people who occasionally watch a Premier League game on the TV, maybe that's on in the pub.

There is, of course, a significant portion of people who aren't interested in football at all, and it's unsurprising that the TV coverage (and there is a LOT of it, every day of the week) is often [considered inescapable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_uOgyBK1c) and [ripe for poking fun at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msN7HNncHik).",0,1417540046,null,0,false,0,cmizo1l,t3_2o211v,t1_cmizo1l,t3_2o211v,null,1425719309,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10

For example, I just recently watched the episode title Listen from the latest series and there were a couple quotes that changed how I think about things. The first was when the doctor was explaining how fear is a superpower. It makes you able to run faster, get stronger, time appears to slow down, etc. And that others should be scared of YOU when you're afraid because you have this ""superpower."" As someone who deals with a lot of fears and anxiety, it really changed how felt about being afraid. It's not something I want to fight against so much anymore. I feel more secure knowing how the fear is actually helping me. It gave me a completely different way to look at it.

The second quote that really resonated with me was similar. It's ""It doesn't matter if there is nothing under the bed or in the dark, so long as you know it's okay to be afraid."" Now I'm at an age where I'm no longer worried that there are monsters under my bed but I do have other fears, some reasonable, some not so much. This quote has reminded me I don't need to fight those fears so much whether they're realistic or not. It's okay to feel whatever I feel. I've been getting really interested in Buddhism lately and I think this can kind of relate to Buddhism and practicing mindfulness. It's about allowing yourself just to be and not judging it.

These are just a couple examples from episode. I'm sure I could come up with many more if I took some time to think about it but this comment is already getting long enough so I'll just stick with this. Good luck with your term paper!

false,VincentKompanini,null,null,"I think football is a pretty important aspect of our culture. For starters it's an instant icebreaker, and gives you a common ground for conversion with millions of other people. Obviously not everyone is into football - some people couldn't care less, and thats fine.

However, I feel like the majority of people (or men, at least) you come across in life have some sort of knowledge or interest of the game, and most of them will support a team. If they support a team, then that opens the door for banter and good natured ribbing - basically football provides an opportunity for the Englishman to pursue his favourite pastime; taking the piss. 

Aside from just providing common ground when getting to know someone, or a basis for office conversation etc. which is sort of passive, going to matches or playing in a Sunday league is also very popular, and these are more participatory aspects. 

Going to the match gives you a chance to get to the pub early, meet your mates or your family or whoever you're going with, have a few, then go to the ground and soak it up and enjoy the game. Its just a great way to spend an afternoon; it's entertainment, it's social, and it gives a sense of belonging to something bigger, which I think is a big part of the sport's appeal and cultural importance. 

Another aspect which follows on from that is that football is often linked to local pride or family tradition. For example people mostly support teams that are local to them, or that have been supported by their dad and grandad etc. so that strengthens a sense of being a part of something that is bigger that you, but that is simultaneously very personal.

To be honest I'm not sure I'm really answering your question here so I'll just stop, but I think footballers aren't really idolised over here. Beckham has his fair share of haters, to use your example. I suppose the stars of yesteryear are viewed with more fondness across the board, and partisan feelings have less of an impact upon what football fans think of them, but still, I wouldn't say they're idolised.",0,1417540718,null,0,false,0,cmj0185,t3_2o211v,t1_cmj0185,t3_2o211v,null,1425719138,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

This whole article is linked by a bullshit interpretation of a law, where the author has assumed the catchment is as wide as possible because it makes a better article rather than correctly presuming reasonable discretion on behalf of the authorities. The law he's concerned about says 

&gt; possess an article in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that this possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism

He ignores most of this and basically twists it to mean ""anything that could theoretically be useful or encouraging to a terrorist"", then gone around his house with his new bullshit law, and found things that apply. He ignores the part of ""reasonable suspicion"", and ""for a purpose of commision, preparation or instigation"". So he ends up believing all manner of inane books and pamphlets could get him arrested, but he has ignored the main part of the law, ie the part of reasonable suspicion that this will be used in terrorism. 

His last sentence says it all -

&gt; Under current UK law, then, perhaps we should be less scared of the potential terrorist lurking in our midst, and more concerned with the legislation that criminalises British citizens on the basis of their bookcase 

Conveniently forgetting again, the part in that legislation which prevents innocent British citizens from being criminalised on the basis of their bookcase - where there is reasonable suspicion to think the books will be used in conjunction with terrorism. So to 99.99% of Britons, that does not apply, regardless of what they have on their bookcase. So no one is getting done for what they read, no one is getting done for what they think.

Can I just talk about how much that bothered me?  I didn't know Sarah Jane before the class reunion ep, but from what I can gather, she was his companion for a relatively long time.  And he just drops her off, tells her he has to go to his home planet and then... nothing?  I don't understand why he never went back to tell her he was okay.  I understand that he couldn't go back immediately - he was traumatized by the destruction of his planet.  But he has a *time machine*.  He could take as much time to recover as he wants, and then go back in time to right after he dropped Sarah Jane off, and tell her he's okay.  I'm not saying he has to continue traveling with her, if she reminds him of the tragedy or something.  But at least let her know.

His treatment of her seemed incredibly selfish, and showed a complete lack of awareness for her situation.  He was ""hiding"" from her, and I thought him better than that.  I think I'm even more disappointed in him because it's becoming clear to me that the Doctor, this Time Lord, doesn't seem to be any more emotionally ""evolved"" than we are, and before I started watching Doctor Who, I thought he was.  I kept hearing about how Doctor Who will make you glad to be human, will make you laugh and cry, and inspire you.

Maybe they didn't get their first choice players every time (Blind for example doesn't seem like he would be a priority 1 for a DM), but they got in players that they can work with.  Their main issue at this point is in defense.  They knew their attack was alright already and had to improve especially in midfield, and then again in defense.  So they brought in:

Defense:

Rojo - Amazing world cup with Argentina and quality player

Shaw - One of the better LBs in the league at 19 years old, set to be a big part of the team for a very long time.


Midfield:

Blind - No-nonsense DM who is technically capable and very tactically flexible. LVG has a good working relationship with him too, astute purchase to work with the new manager.

Herrera - Fake United missed out on him last season, but real United snagged him this time!  He's definitely quality and still not quite in his prime, so he's got some time to grow.

Di Maria - Traditionally an attacking player/winger, Di Maria had a spectacular season playing a more central role for Real last season.  His amazing energy and work rate get him all over the pitch and he contributes well from box to box.

They also signed Falcao, who was probably a little bit surplus to requirements but with RVP looking to slow down a little bit and Chicharito+Welbeck moving on they needed another striker anyway.  If he overcomes his injury stuff he'll be a monster again.  IMO they still need a RB and another CB, plus probably some better cover for Blind and Shaw, but their midfield is dramatically improved and their attackers are superb.

How does that compare to Liverpool? Well, we desperately needed a top quality forward and we instead got Balotelli... who is capable of amazing things but his style doesn't match the rest of the team at all, they're basically opposites.  We then ended up with Markovic and Can, two very young players who still need quite some time to develop.  Can has looked good and able to make a nice contribution immediately, but Markovic really needs a year before he starts firing well.  These players can't help us now.  Lovren has been a terrible signing, and looking at his career so far, he's really only had 2 good seasons ever (one with Lyon and one with Soton... who had 2 amazing defensive midfielders in Scheiderlin and Wanyama camped out in front of him all season).  We grossly overpaid for him regardless of how good he ends up being, but all indications are that we've gotten a pretty mediocre player.  We really could've used a DM and ended up with nothing.  We went after Lallana as an attacking player and overpaid for him.  He's quite good, but nowhere near the level of a player like Di Maria.  Moreno is also one for the future and while he's really good, he needs time to adjust.  similar idea to Shaw, except we'll need to wait a season for Moreno to bed in before he starts to show his true quality every week.  Manquillo is a bizarre situation.  We really needed proven quality in attack, midfield, and defense, and the only area we got anything resembling that is in attack with Lallana and Balotelli, but even then you can ask some serious questions of the two of them.  

Overall, United identified their problem areas and filled as many of them as they could with top quality players.  Liverpool identified their problem areas and filled them all with youth and other inconsistent players.  It's no surprise to me that United is looking better while we still seem a bit lost, they simply purchased substantially better and more mature players (which means they can acclimate quicker and they're more known quantities, which makes them easier to fit together quickly).  their window was a huge success and ours was mediocre at best.  In 2-3 seasons once Markovic's balls drop, we might have a worldie on our hands, but we need top quality impact right now and we didn't buy any of it.

Edit:  I feel I should elaborate, as the question of whether being Jewish is a question of religious belief or ethnicity is a subtle and complex one.  The short answer is that both are true.  Someone born of a Jewish mother (as the line is largely matriarchal in Jewish culture), even though they observe no faith, would be considered Jewish.  Equally, a Brazilian christian who converted to Judaism would also immediately be considered Jewish.

There are certain genetic disorders which populations of ethnic Jews are prone to; this is something that generally happens to what a layman would call a 'race'.  But the reality is that modern genetics have taught us that 20th century concepts like race are totally out of date.  The shifting of the human genome as it colonised the Earth has yielded a world of diversity.  Every human being on Earth likely shares a single common ancestor; we are all, in essence, one huge family of organisms.

Like people have said, there's a whole bunch of stuff to do at Insomnia outside of just playing in the tournament (Exhibition Hall, Main Stage, Side Stages, Pub Quiz etc). as well as having at least one decent European team per event.

The Dota community is pretty good at the events too, if you're the kind of person looking to hang out with other players they seem pretty open to communal activity (and late night poker at the casino). 

Not to take anything away from Epic.LAN though. They put on a great event that I've attended before and hope to attend again (holidays permitted). With a smaller LAN room it's easier to meet teams that are there without prior introduction and they have a pretty chill atmosphere with a lot of drinking (If you're into that).

For socialisation Epic is probably your best bet. The size/separation of Insomnia's LAN halls can lead to less general socialisation. However, I believe Insomnia provides the best gaming experience for UK Dota players in terms of the size and skill of our tournaments.

You're the one trying to link us to Germany, a country that focuses on manufacturing, as opposed to the UK which has a decent manufacturing base, but the engine room is the service and finance industry.  We're entirely different countries with different economies, but for your argument you want to link them.

He can give better tax breaks to manufacturers - salary tax breaks, energy tax breaks, rent tax breaks etc. He could aggressively tax the banking sector - not for nothing are we now known as a tax haven, he could give free degrees to engineering students while doubling the fees on economics majors and so on.

If anything obvious truth that it wasn't a prank to everyone other than those that particularly despise Clarkson and/or the show.

I completely respect and understand how people can despise the aforementioned, but how some people such as yourself can still contend the truth when the facts are presented is beyond me. 

That particular Porsche left the dealership in 1990, just 8 years after the war ended, if it was so obviously a jab at Argentina then I'm sure it wouldn't of left with those plates. 

As pointed out by May, finding the particular car will of been difficult. The 928 is a rare car, less than 61k were built, a large number for a sports car at the time, but a small number comparatively. Of those 61k, just 2592 were the 928 GT model that Clarkson was after. How many of them were right hand drive? Probably not even half, but that would leave less than 1400 cars. Now if you know your 928s you know that most are Automatic, so let's say that 400 of the RHD Porsche 928 GTs were manual and then say that only 270 of those were sold in the UK. Take into account that's 24years ago let's say that only 100 have been exported, written off etc... That leaves us with a measly 170 cars left in the UK. You then have to take into account that most of the owners of said cars will be enthusiasts that do not wish to part with them, so it is an exceedingly small market.

When kids commit crimes to be sent to the JJC and laterly to jail there is something wrong.

The assaults on staff are getting ridiculous as well due to the fact these young people know they are untouchable which is leading to a generation of criminals who are effectively unafraid of consequences and do whatever they want and trust me some of them are extremely violent and dangerous so blaming it all on borstals and staff and so on is very off the mark.

Id recommend you work with these youths then learn what they are like from personal interaction with them rather than watching biased documentaries, then also pulling your head out of your arsehole.

There was no mention of the BELL END plates found in Clarkson's car, for starters. SO they could switch out the plates for a number plate joke, and yet still not notice the existing plate? Unbelievable,

The car still, in my mind, could have been anything.. He says it doesn't matter about the odds of the number plate, so why do the odds matter when it comes down to the car? 1 in 2... so there were 2 Porsches, if we take his word for it, but that's ignoring the x number of other german cars, y number of american cars etc. that would have also been for sale: why did it have to be a Porsche? His theory works both ways.

At 2:40 he says ""A publicity stunt by us? No, why, er, why would we do that?"". I dunno, why *would* Top Gear do a publicity stunt? Come on.

At 3 minutes in he brings up the car plate being original again, as I said before this is irrelevant as they can just buy any car they want, number plate and all, but had they spotted the number plate, would it be difficult to have a new one registered to the car? If they're really worried about causing offence, why not do that just to be on the safe side?

Even if they bought the car by coincidence, there's no way they didn't notice the plate until they were run out of town.

**Edit:** People are now pointing out that they found out about the plates before being run out of town, after someone on twitter brought it up, and then they decided to cover it up.

I still believe they knew the plate's significance despite this, but thought they could get away with it until twitter users kicked up a fuss. Then they went with the plate. Maybe it just seems so obvious to me, but I still can't really see how May, Hammond and Clarkson all missed it. The only reason I have to believe that they missed the 982 referring to 1982, may be that they thought it looked more like 928, the model of the Porsche, and hence thought not much at all of the FLK/FKL ending, thinking maybe it's funny that it makes reference to the place they're visiting, but nothing more. This is more plausible in my mind.

Either way, I don't think it should have caused any offence really, I just found it hard to swallow that it could be a coincidence.

false,lgf92,eng-northumberland,Land of the Sausage Roll,"[According to the CPS](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#common_assault), the difference between common assault and ABH is simply the degree of severity of the injuries. 

Assault and battery are simply any amount of force that is inflicted unlawfully on a person, causing either **no injury** or **non-serious injuries**. ""It should be borne in mind that Parliament created the offence of Common Assault specifically to cater for those assault cases in which the injuries caused are not serious.""

ABH is defined as assault which causes serious injury, or injury that isn't trivial. ""In determining whether or not the injuries are serious, relevant factors may include, for example, the fact that there has been significant medical intervention and/or permanent effects have resulted.  Examples may include cases where there is the need for a number of stitches (but not the superficial application of steri-strips) or a hospital procedure under anaesthetic.

false,JackXDark,null,null," OP, see both of the above posts for a good idea of how divisive football is.

It's something that being apathetic about requires a great deal of effort to maintain.

My personal view of sport is similar to my view of porn. I like doing it, but don't want to watch someone else doing it, and especially don't want to pay to watch other people doing it. Meaning, I enjoy a kick about (and when I was younger I competed at county level in a couple of sports, although not football, the reason I didn't play it was because I was focusing on training for other things) but really can't be arsed with watching it, in the same way that I don't really want to watch porn and would rather have actual sex.

I also get irrationally annoyed with people calling the team they support 'we' as if they're somehow involved. I find people talking about sports teams and events especially boring and irritating. I'd be interested if they were talking about something they'd done themselves, but otherwise it's just as dull as people who talk about soap operas on TV.

But if you actually have a job and leave your house, it's almost impossible to avoid. Some people do grow to utterly hate it, and then in turn, you get people thinking this is somehow a snobbish attitude (as above).

The reason some people dislike it so much, I suspect, is not due to snobbery or that they find talking about it boring, but because when, for example, there's a game on in London between teams from each side of the city, the whole place feels unpleasant, and you get groups of people shouting at each other aggressively in the streets and on public transport, and it puts everyone else on edge as a result.

So I, and I suspect a few others, would prefer to just let football liking people get on with it, but it's very difficult to ignore or avoid, and sometimes feels actively threatening, which does breed resentment towards it.

&gt;The truth is the first time we realised the plate could be a problem was on the third night of our shoot in Argentina (19 September, I believe), when Jeremy was scrolling through Twitter and spotted a comment on one of the auto fan sites, next to a photo of the plate. I remember his surprise and concern.

&gt;There are other witnesses to this fact. In fact, one of them – a mechanic we were using for the first time – has written to the Telegraph Letters page stating he saw Jeremy’s reaction and that it could have been nothing but genuine. (Weirdly, although he’s chased them, the Telegraph has so far not bothered to print his letter.)

&gt;Knowing this could be a problem, our office spoke to the local authorities in Ushuaia, the town where the war issue was most sensitive, and where we would end our trip in ten days’ time with a massive game of car football. We agreed with those authorities that the plates would be removed before we entered the town, and it was at this point – not before we left London – that we decided to get the BE11 END plates made for Jeremy’s car for the football match in the town.",0,1417549364,null,0,false,0,cmj52p6,t3_2o1gu1,t1_cmj52p6,t1_cmj470h,null,1425716716,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I was a huge fan when it started airing in 2005 (I was 13) with Christopher Eccleston, and eventually stopped watching after Peter Capaldi's first episode. My feeling was that the plots tended to be quite lazy, with no attention given to how plausible things were, and no real sense that the stakes were ever that high, because the Doctor always pulls it out of his arse. No matter how bad we're told things are, it's hard to care when you've been trained to know it'll all be okay. These were the main reasons I stopped watching. Every recent season finale tells us the Universe is about to end, and then it doesn't.

2) This kind of banter is really not for after games. You can't say after a win ""Lads its Tottenham"" etcetera. Makes no sense. Its actually being a wuss.


3) Its the tradition of English Football. Whether you are bottom of league 2 or top of the Premiership, facing bottom of league 2 or the champions of Europe, you shit talk your rivals before the match, you back up your team and you stand behind it against all odds. If they fail you suck it up and do it all over again the next week and the next. Its your club and you face its bad times as proudly as its good ones, selecting between the two or hiding behind these things is poor form. This is 10% like asking everyone at the Bridge to respectably chant vs Tottenham up until the moment we start winning because then we can really give it to 'em.


4) With that said if you still don't have the bollocks to stand behind the current Chelsea side who actually have some room for slagging off the rivals and aren't fighting for relegation, then you really selecting when to be a supporter and when not, when to celebrate or not, when to shit talk or not is ridiculous. Just think what will you do as a Chelsea fan if they go without a win in 5-6 games by your logic? Its bound to happen in the future. 


5) Tomorrow night when we go to support, Tottenham fans will take the piss out of us for anything that they can come up with no matter how far fetched or true/false. We will do the same. Only one side wins in the end because even a draw favors one side more than the other.


So its not tempting fate, its called being a proper supporter. Maybe this isn't the best example of it but having the belief in your club to pull it out of the bag when you need them is what football is all about. Going down in flames with it if it doesn't happen after all your effort is also worth it and is called being a proper supporter.


Its pathetic that this is the top comment. If we lose we lose, Tottenham are still Tottenham and we will fucking do it all over again if we had to face them on Saturday too. You think the fans weep their way back silently when we lose/draw? They will have a go at every opportunity on the way back too.

I'm not sure that is what it means. Do you mean streamed live online? There is a major issue about whether or not a porn site constitutes an on-demand programme service which is key to the application of the amendments. However I'm not a media lawyer and I never even studied media law at uni, so everything I've said is what I've read relating to the acts. 

I think one of the main problems there is so much speculation without credible sources. Another main problem is these laws are archaic and cannot keep up with the development of internet media services.

So you think they had two choices when approaching the production of this car programme...

1) They thought they'd do a 'funny' joke, but really subtle, maybe a number plate referencing the Falklands war, even though the show will be based around the Patagonia region rather than Argentina. It doesn't matter what car they get, as long as the number plate could be construed as offensive. Admittedly, it'd only be a twenty second gag in an hour long show, but compromising the choice of car will be worth it. 

or

2) They want to do a show about old V8 powered cars. Jeremy loves the 928. They find two for sale, one of which has a number plate which, if you squint a bit, could reference the Falklands war. Great! Based on that, they decide to send the trio to South America, but make it about Patagonia (part of which is in Argentina) just to make the number plate gag extra subtle.

No, but then they are British graduates so can apply for any job in the UK regardless anyway.

&gt;Once you start working, no one really cares about your degree classification anyway.

I agree, but I'd rather a British graduate with a 2.2 gets the job. 

If you have only managed a 2.2 then you are not skilled in that subject. You can feel free to retake a year and achieve a 2.1 but I disagree with letting you procede from that point on until you reach that skill level. Really a 2.1 is not impossibly hard to achieve if you actually do the work and understand it, its pretty much baseline at this point.

I don't agree with deporting someone the day their last lecture ends, but I also disagree with letting students who under-performed jump the system.

false,B4mf0rth,null,null,"Fuck me, we have a barrel scraper. A) yes I edited it, I added the last two sentences in but didn't put an edit because usually most people don't read and reply so quickly, I sincerely apologise. B) Read this and try to think.  

a) *You tried to say that 19 PMs went to Eton, yet most people don't know anyone from Eton - basically inferring something about how diverse our PMs are. You then somehow thought I had said that the chances of being a PM are so small if you go to Eton.* 

I actually pointed out that your point is illogical. It doesn't work. Because you could take any school in Britain, like for example Harrow, or Cardiff High School, or Ian Mikrado, or any one single individual school, and the chances are that most people in Britain will not know someone from there. Because there thousands of schools in Britain, therefore the chances of knowing someone from any single one is pretty small. Doesn't matter whether it is a public school, a state school, a grammar school or whatever, the chances are still so small. Therefore you cannot make a point about how diverse our PMs are based on the fact that most people don't know anyone from the same school as them. So your argument doesn't work. Because most people will not know anyone from any one particular school. Statistical probability.

B) *Your point that 19 /52 PMs have gone to the same school and doesn't that say something about how undiverse our PMs are. And on this point, we will also include where you've made up that I think that children who pay to go to school are necessarily brighter than state school kids and asked if I was genuinely thick.* 

Right, Eton has been around for about 600 years. Therefore it has been around as long and indeed longer than the period in which we have had Prime Ministers. So unlike many modern schools which have only been open for maybe 5-6 PMs out of 52, and so could have only produced 5-6 max at best, and unlike many of the old schools of the 18th/19th century which have closed, Eton has been consistently open and so has had every opportunity. Unlike most schools.  So that makes it more likely that more PMs would have come from Eton. 

Secondly, I strongly believe that modern state schools can produce excellent students far in excess of private schools and can easily produce PMs. And before you assume otherwise, I went to state school. However, you are lying to yourself if you think state schools have been equal to private schools for all of the 250 years that we have had Prime ministers, state school education has only really taken off post- war so we have only 60 years in which to produce a PM, Eton has had 250. And on top of this, remember that a PM is representative of the school he went to 30-40 years ago as most PMs are middle aged. So you can't think of the education system now, you have to think of the education system of the 1960s currently. The current state school brilliance can only start to come through over the next few decades as its alumi are still growing up. 

Thirdly, I don't believe private school children are necessarily brighter than state school children. However I do believe that Eton is an exceptionally good school, and that is clear by what its alumni have achieved. When you have what is clearly one of the best schools in the country in terms of education, and one that has existed for 600 years, it is no surprise that for the most difficult and powerful job in Britain, Eton has supplied many candidates. Saying that does not mean that I think private education is necessarily better, Eton is hardly representative of all private schools. If it was a state school that had offered up 19 PMs, that school wouldn't be representative of a state school education either.

I have a feeling that Etons time for producing loads of PMs is coming to an end as a great many schools, both state and private have caught up and their alumni are now growing up and entering politics. So it will become far less frequent.

I've seen whole pubs kick off and people get glassed over something happening on a TV screen in a pub. That's at least slightly deranged, no? And I try to avoid football and pubs with sports on, so I hate to think what it's like for people who seek it out. 

What I'm saying is that I wish I could be apathetic and ignore it, but when someone, in what I'd thought was a moderately okay pub in Southsea asked me where I was from, when I was living in Winchester, which is slightly nearer to Southampton than it is to Portsmouth, and I got called a 'fucking scummer' and everything suddenly turned unpleasant, it's really hard to stay neutral, and you know, if it's that bad, fuck that for a laugh. What the hell do you do? It ends up that you avoid anywhere that there might even be the slightest risk of some football hatred type thing you've no clue about.

false,ArtistEngineer,null,null,"I picked the sloes and the damsons for free from hedgerows.

There are loads around the place. Once you know what to look for, they're easy to spot. Look around in August for the distinctive blue berries. Pick them in about September/October when they are soft but not when they are old and wrinkly. Sloe berries will ripen at different times on different bushes so keep looking around if you find one that has over ripened.  Don't eat them, they don't taste good.
 
Damson aren't as common as sloes. Best to look around farms and anywhere you can see taller hedgerows. Try looking near housing estates that were built on or around old farms. They often kept the orchards, and they often appear in a line, often following the ditches/brooks.

EDIT: Method:

* Sort through the sloes, discard those which have holes, wrinkles or are squishy.

* clean/wash, and sort them again. Sometimes worms come out when the you handle and wash them!

* dry them. I usually wash and sort them outside in the sun, then lay them on a clean sheet to dry them

* get a needle/fork/knife and break the skin of each and every sloe. EDIT: or freeze them to break the skin/flesh

* put the sloes in to a large jar, about half full

* top up with gin for sloe gin. You can also use vodka, brandy, rum, or any other spirit you can think of

* turn and gently shake the jar about every week for the first month. Then you can leave it for a couple months. The colour should come out within the first few weeks

* after a few months, pour through a filter. I use a muslin cloth over a sieve.

* discard the sloes OR use them again in something like sherry for the remaining few weeks before Christmas. Soaking sherry in gin-sloes can transform it in to something completely different.

* Put in a bottle. Lots of people add sugar to adjust the taste at this point.

It's tricky.  I guess in a word you could describe the history of the legislation with ""Blunkett"", but the extreme porn law was brought in [almost solely on the back of the Jane Longhurst case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jane_Longhurst#Criminalisation_of_possession_of_.22extreme_pornography.22) when Graham Coutts was found to have been viewing various forms of asphyxiation porn before the murder.  [The local MP](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/3471441.stm) and the victim's mother campaigned hard for some kind of law against the internet side of it, while the fact that it was found that the killer had been indulging in erotic asphyxia play before he even had access to the internet has been largely erased from history.

""Something must be done"" never makes good legislation.  The law is, like many laws of that era, horrendously open to interpretation and, crucially, expansion of definition - and that seems to be what we're seeing at the moment.  Censorship like that never, ever stays in the area it was originally supposed to combat.

I would suggest that any campaign to deal with this asks for a clarification of the law, not a complete repeal.  That way you're not saying that 'anything goes', you're just trying to inject some vague semblance of common sense into the situation.  *How* exactly you would go about wording such a clarification would take some very careful thought, though.

I'd say you'll never get this kind of legislation from the Tories, who seem particularly keen on moralising at the moment, but it was New Labour who brought in the law in the first place so I'm not actually sure there's any realistic prospect of success.  This said, the e-petition idea would at least make sure the issue got raised in Parliament, supposing you could get 100k people to peer out from under their made-in-Britain embarrassment blankets for long enough to put their names to such a measure.",0,1417552928,null,0,false,0,cmj787j,t3_2o2nc8,t1_cmj787j,t1_cmj6bg1,null,1425715711,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

The utility of a house decreases as time goes on. The walls wear, the foundations subside, the roof decays, the price goes up? Makes no sense. How in a country with 10 times as much land than has been built on can the price of a decaying asset increase in real terms? Markets are supposed to bring products to the market cheaper in real terms or at ever increasing utility.

BTL depends entirely on the weirdness of the housing market. Where it is immune to the norms of the free market largely because of archaic protectionist systems that people will defend for dear life. We cannot possibly have a free market in housing. All the people who then depend on the weirdness of housing will lose money. Thus we keep an eternally broken housing market.

That misses the point, it isn't just some random person getting offended by some other random person's number plate. It is Argentina getting offended by a number plate that Top Gear took to Argentina.

There are several variants of FKL, and the H could have been anything. But the plate in question has 982, not just some combination of 8 and 2. That matters, if the plate had been H832 FKL it would probably be a coincidence. The 982 makes it almost 1000 times less likely.

I don't think there are very many suitable plates out of the millions that exist. And they have form for winding up south american countries.

The chances of it being a coincidence seem very small. That doesn't rule it out of course. People can believe what they want, but it looks like a wind up to me.",0,1417555553,null,0,false,0,cmj8txj,t3_2o1gu1,t1_cmj8txj,t1_cmj3puh,null,1425714963,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Both the current and previous Government have expanded the restrictions on pornography - and over the next couple of weeks more restrictions will probably be approved by Parliament. And there isn't really any way to stop it as the main political parties (including UKIP) probably care more about the votes of people who won't care about the banning of types of porn (or those who would support it instinctively) than they do about those who do.

Evidence isn't going to help; the Government's own internal advice recommended against some of the latest changes, or pointed out that the evidence in favour was very sketchy.

Part of me fears that the only way to get some of this censorship rolled back is to change the general culture of sex-negativity in the UK - both online and offline. To the point were - hopefully - sex and sexuality is more acceptable, there are fewer taboos, and words like ""pervert"" have less of a sting. There's also probably some stuff needed about changing views on the interaction between children and sex as that seems to be one of the main driving forces.

So if that happens it may be that within a generation or so we could see some changes.

For now the only other option would be legal action - perhaps a judicial review of the new regulations, arguing that they breach the human right to freedom of expression. But I'm not sure that would have a good chance of being successful, or go down well with the press.

The well-known poem by pastor Martin Niemöller sums it up:

    First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
    Because I was not a Socialist.

    Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
    Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

    Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
    Because I was not a Jew.

    Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

&gt;The __fencing response__ is a peculiar position of the arms following a [concussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion). Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem), the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football), [hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey), [rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football) and [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts). It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.

**Takeaways**

- Richards was fantastic at RB I thought. I had no idea how dynamic he could be on attack and I absolutely loved his motor, didn't stop running all game.

- As i've commented before, Ki and Britton make up the most reliable backline pairing in my opinion. Ki played a fantastic game and it was Britton's ability to remain deep that allowed for Ki to surge forward.

- Shelvey is the perfect midfield for when we need a goal. While he is unpredictable, his long balls are just to good to ignore. While I think Ki - Britton is the most reliable midfield, I think Shelvey-Britton offers the most dynamic. When Ki and Shelvs play together I find our defence is much weaker and our attack becomes too direct at times. Britton really is like our Busquets, I find that his presence on both ends of the ball is quiet but incredibly important.

- Bony is loving football right now. Lets hope he isn't auditioning for City, but rather that he's just feeling it at Swansea. Could have had a hat trick on a different night. Unlucky.

- Bartley is a PL quality starting CB. While I found he struggled a bit with a couple QPR counters, I can't blame him for losing a header to Leroy Fer. When Amat and Fernandez fully recover we are going to have a real selection dilemma. Ash is confirmed, but for the second CB Fernandez is probably the best defender, Bartley plays the ball the best and Amat is a blend of the two. Enviable problem.

- If Montero starts playing games like Arsenal and this one consistently he's gone to a champions league club. Brilliant game.

- Routs and Dyer are still good!!! We are all hot and bothered about Barrow and Montero, but god damn was Routledge good today.

- Flappyhandski is a thing of the past. Can you believe he was free?

**Things to Consider**

- What is our best midfield pairing? Our best centre back pairing? Best Wing pairing? Monk/Jenkins have established fantastic depth at the club

- How long can we hang on to Bony for? How much would it take to justify selling him for?

- I think that this squad is on Everton level and if sustained can be a top-7 team. Please bring me back down to earth

&gt; The UK Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir John Beddington FRS, asked the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering to review the scientific and engineering evidence and consider whether the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing (often termed ‘fracking’) as a means to extract shale gas could be managed effectively in the UK.

&gt;The key findings of this review were:

&gt;The health, safety and environmental risks can be managed effectively in the UK. Operational best practices must be implemented and enforced through strong regulation.
Fracture propagation is an unlikely cause of contamination. The risk of fractures propagating to reach overlying aquifers is very low provided that shale gas extraction takes place at depths of many hundreds of metres or several kilometres. Even if fractures reached overlying aquifers, the necessary pressure conditions for contaminants to flow are very unlikely to be met given the UK’s shale gas hydrogeological environments.
Well integrity is the highest priority. More likely causes of possible contamination include faulty wells. The UK’s unique well examination scheme was set up so that independent, specialist experts could review the design of every offshore well. This scheme must be made fit for purpose for onshore activities.
Robust monitoring is vital. Monitoring should be carried out before, during and after shale gas operations to detect methane and other contaminants in groundwater and potential leakages of methane and other gases into the atmosphere.
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) should be mandatory. Every shale gas operation should assess risks across the entire lifecycle of operations, from water use through to the disposal of wastes and the abandonment of wells.
Seismic risks are low. Seismicity should be included in the ERA.Seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing is likely to be of smaller magnitude than the UK’s largest natural seismic events and those induced by coal mining.
Water requirements can be managed sustainably. Water use is already regulated by the Environment Agency. Integrated operational practices, such as recycling and reusing wastewaters where possible, would help to minimise water requirements further. Options for disposing of wastes should be planned from the outset. Should any onshore disposal wells be necessary in the UK, their construction, regulation and siting would need further consideration.
Regulation must be fit for purpose. Attention must be paid to the way in which risks scale up should a future shale gas industry develop nationwide. Regulatory co-ordination and capacity must be maintained.
&gt;Policymaking would benefit from further research. The carbon footprint of shale gas extraction needs further research. Further benefit would also be derived from research into the public acceptability of shale gas extraction and use in the context of the UK’s energy, climate and economic policies.

You see, the types of porn mentioned is pretty much everywhere.

So it sails through, and everyone who watches porn where the words 'bitch' or 'slut' are used is now on a list of people that could be associated with pedophiles - ""possessing illegal pornographic images"" etc etc

Davies suits the system we played against Everton where we have two up front and Eriksen on the left. Last year when Rose played in Sherwood's system we got found out way too many times there because Rose was not covered by someone like Lennon. 

Whilst Eriksen has improved his tracking back, Davies suits this system because he is less likely to bomb forward at every opportunity. Also there are less people to cover from the CDM role. In such a system like at the weekend/Sherwood-y there's not as much need for the support from Wing Backs either (although it doesn't hurt to support at the right time). 

Rose suits the 4-2-3-1 system, particularly where there are inverted wingers, where support and width is needed to create space and attacking opportunities (this is also where we have really been missing Walker to create balance). Also in this system there is cover from one of the 2 CDMs, if and when a he bombs on, so there is less chance of him/us being caught out. 

I'm split on who is better at the moment, but I would keep rotating. Rose does need to be covered however, because he does lack the ability to hold himself back at times. Maybe we could play a lop sided 4-4-2 with him and 3 central midfielders and a RM, if we were desperate (Davies out etc.)

Carroll played very well, I thought. Especially considering he only had 2 days rest and still isn't fully fit. He gave them fits in the air and almost scored a bicycle kick for the ages... only to have it cleared off the line and rebounded in by Nolan.

Nolan played his typical game. There were stretches where he couldn't be bothered to run more than 10 yards at a time.

Nolan and Zarate played well for me. Downing and Carroll did too. It's a shame possession and service completely died out in the second half.

Thought Jarvis should have come in for Amalfitano with Collins on for Tomkins. Thought it was an odd time to decide to go completely defensive when Collins subbed for Amalfitano and Tomkins moved to CDM.

false,HipsterRyanMason,null,null,"Naughton is to Davies as Walker is to Rose. It is not that simple but that it is a fair comparison. I think a lot of Rose's criticism has come from his  last season when nearly every player under performed. As soon as we bought Davies I think the bulk of this sub was ready to dump Rose and hope they never had to see him again. Instead of accepting a place has a backup to Davies, Rose has worked hard, improved and has been one of our most consistent players this season. Rose was even rewarded with an England call up. In my opinion Rose fits Poch's system better than Davies. It calls for an attacking full back that can bomb up the pitch like Walker and Yedlin at every oppurtunity. As our inverted wingers cut inside we need the fullbacks to provide width and I think Rose has done an outstanding job of that this season. 

What Rose has in athletic ability Davies makes up for by being mentally smarter. He uses the ball smartly and does not give it away cheaply. The same can be said with Naughton this season. While Rose has had a very good season to this point, I would consider Davies with the exception of the last match to have been pretty lackluster. I think it is to soon to say that Davies has earned his spot over Rose. Look how long Poch lingered with Adebayor before he started giving Soldado and Kane chances. I feel Rose deserves the same amount of respect. 

To sum it up I think Rose fits the system better and has played better but is an easy scapegoat thanks to last season. I think Rose has better potential and I think Poch can get more out of him. Davies is a reliable player and smart with the ball. Davies time may come but it hasn't yet. If Rose hadn't gotten injured I don't even think there would be that legitimate of an argument for Davies over Rose.

false,MatthewWilkes,null,null,"They will find out your employment status when you fill in your P46 form. That is the one where you don't have a current P45 form. The P46 covers employment only, as it's used to determine which tax code to assign to you until the employer gets the correct information.

""I haven't had a job"" translates to ""give him/her the standard tax code""
""I have had a job but it's finished"" translates to ""give him/her a tax code that calculates the standard allowance per paycheck, rather than over the year""
""I have another job"" translates as ""assume all income is at the lower tax rate""

The form *will* be passed to HMRC, so mistakes are sorted out, but it can leave you paying the wrong tax and having to pay extra until the end of the tax year.

If you pick ""I haven't had a job"" the employer might think it's weird, in which case you'd have to either tell the truth about it being cash in hand, or come up with some lie like that it was as a sole trader, as that tax is handled separately from the PAYE code system. If HMRC decided to ask you about this (I have no idea why they might, probably only if someone tipped them off about you) and you keep up the story of being a sole trader they'll bill you for at least £200 in national insurance (which you can contest as you had 'small earnings') and might investigate you for not declaring your business. 

If you pick ""I had a job"" then you will likely overpay tax until April, you'll eventually get a refund but HMRC might investigate you. My **personal** belief is that it's unlikely they'd investigate, as it's such a small amount, but given you'd have to ask them for the refund of the money anyway it might lead to some awkward conversations at the least.

If you pick ""I have another job"" then you'll massively overpay tax (20% of your income until April) and have the disadvantages of above.

TL;DR any of the three options on the P46 can lead to HMRC investigations. None are especially likely.

false,shroob88,null,null,"As others have said, our degree courses are more specialised than the typical American courses.  Whereas Americans spend 2 years in 'general' subjects then pick a route to follow, it could be argued that the English (possibly UK - I'm not sure on Scotland/N.I./Wales) system starts the process when students are 16 and have to pick A Levels.  

A levels are by far the most usual way to enter university. After secondary school (ages 11-16) a student either goes to college (different to the US meaning of the word) or 6th form.  Here students are generally 16-18 years old, but not always, and study 3-4 subjects.  These subjects influence the degree they can take at university.  For example, if a student took: Maths, Physics, Chemisty, and IT.  They could probably apply to university for any of these courses, or related courses.  They could not apply for History or English lit.  Well, they could apply, but the changes of being accepted are very slim.  Equally, if a student studied History, English, and Geography, they couldn't get on an Engineering course.

If you don't buy this view, then it still stands that English university courses have 3 years (typically) of subject related classes.  Ok, the first year may be 'Introduction to X' or, 'Theories of X', but it's still related to that subject.  An increasing number of universities will allow students to choose a class outside of their area e.g. a language for credit, but this credit proportion is a small ratio of the overall degree.  Perhaps 15 credits out of 120 for a year.  The remaining 105 being subject related content.

In light of this, it could be said that the UK system is actually a longer process than the US, as students, knowingly or unknowingly, choose the route they will take aged 16.  ",0,1417562393,null,0,false,0,cmjcwba,t3_2o2mg1,t1_cmjcwba,t3_2o2mg1,null,1425713004,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

if that is the case, that means dropping one of our attacking players. soldado and kane have to start together again. kane is not a lone striker so there is no point in playing upfront on his own without a partner. he comes  and dribbles with the ball from deep. if he is to play it's to be behind soldado. soldado also cannot be dropped. last time he scored against cardiff and confidence was high he was immediately dropped for the next game. keep things the way they are while things are on a high.

lennon's tracking back is going to be crucial to try nullify Hazard etc. we haven't won at the bridge in like 24 years or something silly like that. i don't have too much confidence but this will be the hardest game of the season.

The part about potentially destroying the inner container by writing to outer one? Yes, in complete agreement there. The part I take issue with is where you say ""there is zero way to prove the inner's existence"".

I, as an experienced forensic examiner, can determine when a container was last accessed via filesystem-level artefacts. Once I have the key to that container (lets say you willingly gave it up as a duress password) I can correlate filesystem artefacts with the contents of the container. When I find a bunch of artefacts that I can't correlate, my suspicions are raised. As I said, I don't need to *prove* the existence of another container, just show that it's likely to exist.

I've been assuming that the inner OS is inside a series of Truecrypt volumes. That's easy mode (relatively speaking) for an examiner. The host OS will let you down every time. Whole disk encryption is the way to go, but how *are* you proposing to boot the inner OS without leaving a trace on whatever filesystem your decryption software is running?

Custom bootloader? You can bet we're going to tear that to pieces, just to see how it works. What happens when I dump the memory? Swap? Pagefile? Hiberfile.sys? You can hide data at rest, but the code has to execute somewhere.

Remember, encryption on anything other than mobile devices is still pretty rare, and it's only recently becoming more common on mobiles. Anything uncommon is immediately going to grab the interest of an examiner. People in forensics tend to be geeks too!

&gt; Remarks that you should avoid commenting then aside,

&gt;

&gt;___Save Ulster from Sodomy___ was a [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics) campaign launched in 1977 by the Rev. [Ian Paisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley), [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament), then leader of the [Democratic Unionist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party) (DUP) and [Free Presbyterian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Ulster), to prevent the decriminalisation of [homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) acts in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).  The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.

You're going to be living in the countryside either way, but Hertfordshire gives you options. In particular, the nearest town to Kings Langley is Watford, which is on the London Overground network (a slower versiion of the S-Bahn or RER if some Continental comparisons help) as well as the London Underground. So you can take get to central London on an Overground or Underground train that stops at every small station on the line for about £5 each way. Alternatively, you can take a fast London Midland (=National Rail) train for as little as £8 one way, £12 return off peak (though if you just arrive in the morning rush hour without booking it will cost you much, much more).

Of course, if you don't have a car, you will have the problem of getting from Kings Langley to Watford. Start searching here: http://www.travelinesoutheast.org.uk/se/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en&amp;timeOffset=15

To me the obvious choice is Kings Langley, there is *far* more to do. Truro is far more rural and scenic, if you're an outdoorsy countryside type person you'll like it, with plenty of coastline as well. Otherwise there isn't too much to do.

edit: after further reading, are they saying, of 55,000 'incidents' (In my understanding an incident might be a bottle thrown during a protest, another incident would be a brick thrown shortly after, another bottle would be a third 'incident') they sent files to the PPS for 370 people, and 37 of them ended up in jail?

 The Chelsea first XI seem like they've been worked very hard this season, while we were looking full of energy and industry against Everton. If Poch can play it right and give the players the tactical platform to compete (i.e not leave us exposed to some of their clear attacking attributes), then I think we're in with a real chance of taking all 3 points. 

Lloris, Naughton, Vertonghen, Fazio and Davies are all nailed on to start as far as I'm concerned. Our strongest centre-back pairing, our only actual available right-back and the squad's best defensive left-back. Can't see Poch going with any other back 5. 
In midfield Bentaleb is first on the teamsheet; his composure and distribution will be vital. We need two others there; I'd stick with Mason, as the forwardmost player in the midfield triangle, and put Capoue/Stambouli/Dembele next to Bentaleb. Personally I'd go for Stambouli because the way he tackles is an artform, but I can see Poch going for Capoue as a more experienced physical presence. Lennon is a must on the right; defensive cover vs Hazard, a direct attacking threat and a seasoned head. On the left I'd play Eriksen in the same role he had versus Everton, and that leaves Soldado to lead the line. 

Chadli is a good option to come on and play on the left, much like Lennon he offers a direct threat going forward and does his defensive work. In fact I can see Poch starting him out on the left and shifting Eriksen in. Harry Kane, the man, the myth, the legend could do with a rest I think, but I'd definitely like to see him get at least 30 minutes. 

I fucking hate Chelsea. I'd love it if we can pull this off. If we can not concede for the first 20 minutes and give them a physical battle then I really think we're in with a shout here.

It would be one thing if England fostered and developed a national style of play that paralleled Liverpool's or any other top clubs. It's worked in the past with the sort of symbiotic/generational talent development in Barcelona/Spain and Bayern/Germany. 

But us having the England team's core of players really just frightens me... makes me a bit proud yes. But it must be that I'm half American and so a little less patriotic about this kind of stuff.

I was cold, tired, sore, and just in a bratty mood (I was 16 and was using this trip to recover from tearing my acl) and so my dad decided to pack our bikes up for a day and spend a day and night on Clare island. So we did. We ended up at a pub that was heavily liverpool oriented and we went in to catch the villa game. (My dad doesn't like sports too much, but will watch liverpool and the Tour de France with me like its his job) and so we go in. We get pints of Guinness and watch liverpool toil with villa team led by petrov.

Someone in the porn industry (and the human rights act requires that people so speak for themselves) should challenge the act. Get a declaration of incompatibility. They may well have to go to Strasbourg, though. I imagine they'll be looser on porn on Europe, but then probably there is enough disparity that the Strasbourg court would leave it within the margin of appreciation. So I'd say legally we're fucked, and this really needs to be paired with a more palatable issue for it to go mainstream. But that's exactly what has to be done.

It's a pity half the country is too stupid to understand the point of human rights.

They actually clarified their stance on this and to quote:
   
""""If I may clarify our position, the Board does not in fact take any view on whether or not female ejaculation exists. As you admit in your letter this is a controversial and much-debated area with a range of views being taken amongst medical professionals. At the most basic level, however, the Board is content that the pornographic tapes so far presented to us as examples of 'female ejaculation' are in fact nothing other than straightforward scenes of urination masquerading as 'female ejaculation'.    
This has been confirmed by a female sexual health expert who the Board has consulted on a range of issues relating to videos intended for the 'R18' category. Quite the opposite of attempting to confront the issue of female ejaculation in a reassuring, sympathetic or informative light, the tapes in question appear to be nothing more than a cynical attempt on the part of porn distributors to get around the constraints imposed on urolagnia in sex tapes by the current interpretation of the Obscene Publications Act. 
   
It is worth noting that the kind of material that the Board has been cutting is regularly sold as 'urolagnia' in other European countries (France, Germany, Netherlands, etc) where there is no equivalent legal restriction on the use of urine in sex videos. Indeed, although videos featuring urolagnia are very much in evidence on the continent, videos purporting to show 'female ejaculation' seem to be invisible. Perhaps female ejaculation is less exciting (or profitable) to pornographers and their viewers than urination? Generally speaking sex videos of the type encountered at 'R18' neither seek to inform nor educate about female (or male) sexuality but merely offer graphic (and grossly distorted) views of sex for the arousal of viewers.    
Indeed, as you acknowledge in your letter ""much of the material [the Board] passes with an 'R18' certificate does not necessarily represent the sexual experiences of all women"". To conclude, the Board remains open minded about the issue of female ejaculation but we have yet to be presented with any pornographic video that has convinced us - or our medical advisor - that it consists of anything other than an excuse to display scenes of urolagnia. Such scenes are regularly found obscene by juries in the UK and therefore cannot be classified.""

To be honest it kind of makes sense to me. I don't agree with the ban, but they do have a valid view.

They're both permanent residency (PR). The only difference is Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) is granted to someone already in the UK and Indefinite Leave to Enter is granted to someone outside of the UK.

The methods used on prisoners included deprivation of sleep, food, and water, forcing prisoners to remain in stress positions for hours, bombardment with white noise, and hooding the detainees in order to disorient them - including when they were being flown by helicopter to the base, which was then unknown, and when they were thrown from the helicopter as it hovered a short way above the ground. The UK government has stated that it will not do these things to any other prisoners in the future and £12,500 was awarded to the fourteen men.

false,DefectOrFearture,logo,,"I am not familiar with Bebe's case, but as a non-EU foreign player, Iheanacho wouldn't qualify for a permit because

1) the player has to have played for his country in at least 75% of its competitive A team matches in the two years preceding the application (Nigerian senior national team in World Cup matches and qualifiers, continental tournaments and qualifiers); and

(2) the player’s country must be at or above 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings. (The ranking is the average of the two rankings from the 2 years preceding the application)

Iheanacho doesn't qualify because he hasn't made the required appearances at senior national level. But, I think Nigeria would have an avg. rank of at least 70.

Qualifying via the above is called a Tier 2 ""Sportsperson"" visa. There is also a sponsorship component to Tier 2, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for Premier League clubs, such as ours. The actual ""exceptional talent"" Tier 1 visa doesn't apply to sportspeople any longer. 

There are also some other ways that foreign players can play in UK, if the player can't get a Tier 2 visa (i.e., doesn't have the senior matches or the home country is not ranked high enough by Fifa over previous 2 years).

1) Highest Calibre standard:  the club can appeal to the FA. A panel decides whether the player is of the ""highest calibre,"" and whether the player is able to contribute significantly to the development of the game at the top level in England. Ultimately, this method requires endorsement of the FA itself, not just the appeals panel. The first link below has a really nice chart, showing which players since 2009 were considered to meet this standard. Of note from MCFC are Savic, Nastasic, Pantilimon, and Pizzarro! Also of note, the one Nigerian player  who was deemed highest calibre (Taye Taiwo, QPR, 2012) had tons more European experience before applying (37 club matches in Europe, and Ligue 1 TotY three times) than Kelechi has at this point.

2) Loaning within the EU: The UK has maybe the tightest restrictions on non-EU players getting visas. Other countries in the EU are much less strict. If a club loans a non-EU player within the EU, that player can easily (relative to UK) get a EU visa. Netherlands, for example, gives non-EU players visas if they have just ONE of these three:
a) player's national team is top 40 Fifa ranking when applying for visa;
b) player has played in at least 1 match for senior national team; or
c) player has played in at least 1 Uefa Champs league or Europa league match. 

The point of loaning the player to a European team is to give the player a stage on which to get recognized by his national team, get the required number of senior national team matches, and then get the Tier 2 visa. I think it's important for the player to be loaned within Europe because overall it's seen as the highest-level confederation. In theory, though, Kelechi could just as easily make the Nigerian senior team by ripping it up in MLS. He's already on the national team's radar.  

To get Iheanacho's Tier 2 permit fastest, I think he would have to be deemed ""highest calibre."" He'd need to get loaned to a Champions' or Europa League side, get play time in those competitions, score goals in them, and get at least a few games with the national team. I would think he helps his cause because he won 2013 U-17 World Cup MVP and ‎tournament golden ball, and also the CAF ""most promising talent of the year"" award in 2013. Playing in MLS, I think he'd have to actually play in 75% of Nigeria's games over 2 years. There may be other ways too. 

Hope this is helpful, and mostly accurate! I'd heard about the ""exceptional talent"" work permit a few times before but didn't really look into it till you brought it up!

Let Davies put in some more performances in like this and I will be thrilled to have him as a regular member of the starting 11.  As for now I think Rose still deserves the spot, even though if it is just for the time being.  The good thing is we have two solid LB and if one goes down we won't have a crisis like we do with the RB position.  Also if something did happen Jan sliding over is an improvement on any of our other CB sliding over to RB, even though I do like what I have seed from Vlad in his extremely small sample size at RB.  I think its a good fit for him right now because it gives him the freedom to burst forward which he has had trouble containing while playing CB.

She practises Tai Chi, Chi Goong (barely martial arts in my opinion but...) and is a trained Chinese Therapeutic masseuse (hocus pocus massage). Goes to China maybe once a year for a couple of weeks. She also does some sort of Chinese sword martial art. None of it is properly energetic stuff, more the slow appeals-to-women-getting-on-in-years kinds.

She reads books but they're all proper niche shit, mostly translated badly from Chinese. I'd get her a DVD of some Chinese movie but I think me and my siblings have beaten that horse to death over the last 10 years or so.

Problem with asking her what she wants is that she's the sort of person who'll say she doesn't want anything. She already turned down the idea of any sort of party or celebration or anything. She's just one of those mums who gets on with stuff in the background and if you ask her will claim that's all she wants to do.

false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"Expanding university education is a nice platitude but it hasn't helped anyone. In reality, there aren't many jobs where a degree is required in order to do them well. Of my friends who went to university, only about a third are in jobs where their degree is of use. Not necessarily jobs where their degree is directly related but jobs where it has given them useful skills for that job. 

Essentially it boils down to four tiers, as I see them:

1) Graduates with full on graduate jobs where they are usually paid very well (About 1/3 graduates in my experience). 

2) People who never went to uni but who got good jobs off the back of an internship, or using the three years they saved without uni doing 'real' work that led to a good job (inherently better than doing the same job without a degree because they don't have the debt. They make up about 1/3 of non graduates in my experience. 

3) Graduates who got a job that specified a degree in the application but doesn't actually require one. They have the debt without the benefits.
 
4) Non graduates who can only get menial unskilled work. 

Ideally, everyone would be in the top two categories. How do we do that? By halving the number of university places while spending the money saved on investment into apprenticeships and trade schools. If the graduates can get good graduate jobs, then they won't need to go into recruitment, retail management, HR etc, areas where some of the best people didn't get degrees. 

This means that all the people who didn't go to university can now get the jobs that previously would have only gone to graduates, despite not needing graduates to do them well. The people in group 3 don't have a £30,000 debt but still have the same job. 

All that our current system does is devalue bachelors degrees and screw people who aren't academically motivated or talented. Some people are amazing with their hands, or have phenomenal people skills that would translate well into HR or management, but simply cannot access those jobs because they didn't get an A in A level geography.",0,1417596243,null,0,false,0,cmjrlov,t3_2o2fnz,t1_cmjrlov,t1_cmjqr9v,null,1425705990,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
