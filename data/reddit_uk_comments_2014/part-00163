true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"True, /u/WeirdF's post is *extremely* idealistic. I recognise that, as left wing as I am. I'd love to live in a world where basic services including healthcare and travel were free and taxpayer funded (well healthcare is already free but they've been banging on about privatising the NHS lately). I'd love to live in a world where everybody was entitled to a good education regardless of their wealth, like they do in Scotland. Cutting back on military spending would be a good way to fund all of this, but I guess people would consider us vulnerable then. I can't imagine any country would be keen on invading Britain even if we *did* cut back a lot on military spending, but eh.

I do think euthanasia should be legal even in our current government. If a patient is dying of a terminal illness and has no possible way of recovering, they should be permitted to determine the manner of their death. It's more dignified that way.

As for drugs, again, if we legalised all of them we could tax the motherfuck out of them. This would pay for most of the OP's demands (free education, benefits). I think cannabis should be legal as a matter of course. Harder drugs are more difficult... I hate that anybody uses those drugs, but I'd rather see *safe* versions of these drugs than shady drug dealers cutting them with god knows the fuck what. 

I think OP's ideas would work well with a solid left-wing government, or centre-left even. We'd just be shifting the balance a little bit.

&gt;As I've said there DEFINITELY WOULD BE LESS EU doctors if there were visas. Getting a visa is not like buying a ticket for a plane!!!

So?

If there's less EU doctors in the NHS because we're recruiting better skilled doctors from other countries then that can only be a good thing.

&gt;Yeah, nice to pick up the poorest EU country, out of the 27 there are, just to make some kind of a point. 

A point that stands. Albeit slightly scaremongerish.

&gt;And to tell you something, which you, a typically ignorant person doesn't know about, it is often that in least expectable place something major can come out. For example, I'm from Poland and whether you believe me or not, Polish medical system and their doctors are often much more capable than the British ones. I know that  because I work in that field (but no, I'm not a doctor myself).

If we want any meaningful generation from solar photovoltaic sources then we need to industrialise a considerable amount of countryside. This is a bit hard to justify if environmental concerns are driving your shift to renewables. 

More importantly though, photovoltaics are really really expensive. Maybe if they were cheap it would be a good idea, but we'd just be sinking money into something we would never get a return on. All this would be is a tool used by politicians to boost their environmental credentials in the eyes of the electorate, not a meaningful attempt at diversifying the UK's electricity supply, because ultimately if the economics don't add up then the idea is never going to catch on. 

It would make far more sense to install these panels in somewhere with a larger amount of direct sunlight (north Africa for example) and import the electricity. It would make even more sense to use solar collector technology instead of photovoltaics. The truth of the matter is that you can't have quick fix short term projects and expect everything to be fine. We need international cooperation and a significant amount of time and money spent on development and infrastructure for meaningful energy diversification.

British air power doctrine recognises that attacks against the operating surfaces of runways can have limited effect.[40] Planning for the raid called for a bomb run in a 35° cut across the runway, with the aim of placing at least one bomb on the runway and possibly two.[23] The main purpose in doing so was to prevent the use of the runway by fast jets; in this respect the raid was successful as the repair to the runway was botched and subsequently there were several near accidents

If you want intellectual opinion, the mainstream media aren't going to be any help. The mainstream media are bankrolled by corporate interests. The reason university research is meant to be trustworthy is because it's (meant to be) free of that pressure. Some academic journals are accessible though most of this kind of research is behind a paywall.

If you want to know what I really think, well, there's no such thing as objectivity at all. In philosophy and the arts and even the sciences, there's quite a large degree of debate on the very nature of truth and objectivity.

However, I do think that's a bit harsh to say Livermore didn't have passion during his time with us because he's interested in a move to Hull. Yes, what Dawson did was extraordinary loyalty. But at his age, it was likely just to be a continuous slide down the totem pole from there on. Livermore is 25, with plenty of a career ahead of him while not seeing time with us. I don't blame him one bit for asking to move on since Hull can not only promise him first choice, but he seemed to really enjoy playing there.

That's a huge overstatement. Dawson didn't fit into AVB's plans because he's slow. Other than that, he still reads the game well and is an aerial force.

It's fucking media hype exclusively saying those things, because Dawson actually played fairly well, given his limited skillset.

This gives me a chance to drone on about some philosophy of science:

Consider how science works.  Individual scientists may have very strong biases, but as long as the system remains neutral then science will still work.  Thus, an individual scientist might be Marxist, Libertarian or whatever and there's no problem because his/her work can be criticized by others who don't share his ideologies.  But, there would be a serious problem if an entire academic department, or branch of science enshrined the ideology into its framework. 

Now, The Guardian doesn't pretend to be entirely neutral.  It does have a professed left-wing leaning.  However, when ideological biases of a newspaper get too strong then there is no-one left to counter the ideologues and debate starts to suffer.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"I think it has become more ideological on certain issues such as feminism and Islam.  It's also become quite click-baity in promoting CiF knee jerk outrage pieces.  

Let's take Islam.  Some left of center people think that Islamic conservatives could pose a genuine threat to secularist (and left wing!) values.  Others think that fears over Islam are due to nothing more than xenophobia and that problems in the Muslim world are mostly due to Western imperialism.  I don't know and don't much care which opinion you have, but the point is that The Guardian currently seems to have an 'in house' policy of promoting only the second of those opinions.

Or we could look at feminism.  The Guardian has run several comment pieces linking the recent mass shooting to misogyny.  Again, I don't much care if you agree or not.  The point is that these claims are being promoted as dogma with little opposition.

To be honest, I think this reluctance to engage in different points of view is  related to a more general intolerance among those on The Left.  You can see the same intolerance in this subreddit every day in which, on some issues, anything but the 'accepted' left-wing view points are down voted whether they contribute to the discussion or not.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"Contrary to popular opinion, I'm always happy to be in it if not in the CL. Yes, the evidence is rather damning for English teams' league performances upon returning from Europa games... but considering we should always expect to make it past the group stages if we're in the competition, the knockout stages pit us up against some very interesting competition we'd face anyway in the Champions League. Keep in mind of course, the additional point of interest this upcoming year is the winner gets an automatic berth in the following season's CL, so the competition of the entire thing will inevitably heat up.

The criticism it gets is deserved though, so I don't argue with anyone who resents or decries it. These trips to the far corners of Europe (this past year, we faced the single farthest northern club registered in UEFA, and faced one of the farthest to the southeast, which is even worse considering England is in the northwestern corner of Europe) are not only awkward being midweek, but all the more time consuming and wreck all the more damage on circadian rhythms due to extreme jet lag. Also, while it's fun facing such teams, it is some bullshit that teams from the CL get to drop down after *failing* against mostly Western European competition, while the rest of the teams have been slogging away in the far corners of Europe. Before Sevilla won it this past year, only Atletico Madrid in 2011 won the competition after going the whole way through. Every single other year in the modern format, a CL drop-down team has won it, including Atleti again the following year. 

IMO though, we should likely have the squad to handle the remote group stages while also sparing some of our more essential players for the Prem. I do think we'll see a fair number of players depart this summer, but even then I think it's a great chance for Poch to integrate the youth and some of the fringe players.

We were missing that taeget man alternative that he offers. And from what I've seen of Can(which isn't much) he is the alternative or substitute of Henderson. He seems to have a similar engine that made Henderson so important to us. Can (as Henderson)  seems to be good a lot of things yet not the best at any of them. With the other rumors going around I would like to think that Moreno will end up with us next season. I really like Shaquiri and Lallana but I don't think we'll end up with both.

Fortunately, it's almost never crazy hot here.

Once you've converted that to Farenheit you'll fall around laughing, if you're in any way used to typical American summers.

Late June's actually one of the nicest times of year, warm enough to walk around in t-shirt and shorts and not usually too muggy -- that tends to happen a little later in the summer. And of course the best thing about midsummer in Britain is that the sun doesn't set until after 10pm, summer evenings outside the pub or at a BBQ in someone's garden are one of the most enjoyable things you can do.

As for visiting the countries, you can do that at any time of year, but you should always be prepared for rain.

Many people including myself have called for so many transfers including selling players that were brought in last summer, but that just doesn't seem smart to me now. The new 7 went through 2 new managers with vastly different philosophies in a year when players were positioning themselves for World Cup spots. I just do not think we saw what the new players can bring to the table now that they are settled. They all must adapt to a new manager once again, but this time they aren't going to also be moving their families to a new country, learning new language, finding homes, and meeting new teammates. I would rather us use our transfer money on a LB that can make an impact and some cover for CB. But attempting another overhaul will most likely cause us to continue this cycle of not defining ourselves. No players have come out to say they want to move, Ade seems to be happy and based on his inclination to track back and cover he seems to genuinely give a fuck now (maybe he knows he is old and needs to try now to stay on a good team or maybe I am just optimistic). Let's see what this team looks like with a healthy Lamela, a settled Soldado, and a blossoming Eriksen in attack, while we also have sufficient depth to challenge in multiple competitions.

Add the other two and that's 6 players for the starting 4 slots (Putting in mind, we sometimes prefer to play with 3 forwards and add an extra body in midfield). It only player getting relegated to the bench that would make sense is Coutinho as Rodgers seems to realise that he's not consistent and lacks form in tight games, which is where Llanna would come in. As for Shaqiri and Sterling, I can't see Sterling getting relegated to the bench, and I can't see Shaqiri being satisfied with a sub role (That's the reason he's leaving Bayern) so as weak as my argument may be, getting both would worry me that Suarez might be leaving.

&gt;What would be a good price to pick him up for?

Given his history, 5-8 million (don't know why 8, arbitrary number I guess) Euros is a fair amount. We paid less for Holtby, and he should arguably start for us. 

&gt;Do you think he will choose us over Sunderland if he was to make a decision?

This is a radical opinion, but I doubt it. 
Poyet, like Poch is an Argentine too, so we can dismiss the nationality connection. And like you've said, our midfield is big enough to fill a small island. If he wants to move on to bigger and better things, we're really not the destination as he'll likely be riding the bench in favor of Dembele, Paulinho, Sandro, Capoue, and Bentaleb. At Sunderland he'll start. 

&gt;How do you think Banega will do in a system like Pochetinno's and is there any aspect we lack that he can fill?

His reputation as a passer is pretty great, isn't it? I think we're missing that from the middle, and we'll need one if we're to compete. With Chelsea getting Fabregas, Arse with Ramsey, City with every player under the sun, Liverpool with Stevie G having someone in that position with proper passing ability, we need one too.

&gt;Will we have offload anyone to bring him in and guarantee first-team game time, especially considering how stacked our central midfield is?

I don't think we'll have to offload anyone in that position. I know that everyone thinks we're stacked in midfield, and between Dembele, Paulinho, Sandro, Capoue and Bentaleb all being able to play in the middle, he's a luxury. 

I'd prefer to develop Bentaleb. He's a product of the youth academy, will likely be on smaller wages, and has experience in England (though it's half a season). That and he's shown an incredible eye for pass. Why buy Banega, a 25 year old with a history of inconsistency and personal issues, when we can bring up one of our own to fill that same slot?

Awful idea. Millions of chavs and uneducated people vote randomly. Or our current political situation gets even worse. Populist opinion and knee-jerk politics would dominate even more than now.

Dear god. Has any country ever done this successfully?

&gt;Massively decrease the defense budget; scrap Trident and decrease our number of nuclear warheads to less than 50

Another clueless policy. The UK is the 6th largest economy in the world. You probably think we are just some irrelevant island, but this is simply not true. We are a major world power, and our large, powerful and modern military is essential. It's also naive to think that war is impossible. This modern peacetime is just a blip on the radar. It is by no means guaranteed to continue. And it's naive to think that the UK could somehow be neutral or avoid it if it happens. 

Also, if you scrap trident, we would have nowhere to store and launch missiles anyway.

Teacher pay is already pretty good. It's competitive with private sector salaries in most areas. And good physics/maths teachers can get up to £10k signing bonus right now. 

&gt;Bring back student grants - a university education should be free to all citizens

Why? What's the point? It just seems like a huge waste of money. Does the country really need 50% of people or more to be educated to degree level? And hell, if you already nationalised all industry, why do people even need degrees?

Get out of the EU. Encourage grammar schools. Abolish taxes for the lowest tax bracket and low welfare for the able-bodied.

However, that's just the average and individual managed funds may indeed do better than trackers. But the question then becomes: why do you, as an investor, believe you're better than average at picking managed funds to invest in?

It's also important to note that a run of good performance is not necessarily predictive. It could just be per-year luck (plus survivorship bias - fund providers tend to close badly performing funds, which is why they always have a selection of historically good-performing funds to sell you), but there is luck at the multi-year scale: it could be that a fund manager has a particular investing style that might actually perform badly over the long term, but works well for a few years in a row due to particular market conditions.

Yet, doctors from ""bad"" universities still get employment in the UK and they have exactly the same way of getting into employment as others. Doctors from better unis may have priority, but nobody will say ""No applications are allowed from doctors who finished x university"".

&gt;But that isn't a UK issue. In increasing EU levels the UK bar is going to drop lower if it has to raise the EU average.

Is is while the UK is a part of that global initiative. Just like UK helps other countries by having overseas aid. Of course you could argue UK wouldn't have to do and participate in any of these.... but that's for the whole nation to decide (and understand first) and would be pretty selfish.

&gt;GREAT! So you just abandon that EU doctors need to be in the EU to be hired by the NHS

But we get to first topic, which was that it's easier to get doctors from the EU or doctors from the EU have easier way to get into work in the UK (both quite different things). Not being in the EU would mean less EU doctors. Simple as that.

&gt;Yet all I'm suggesting is that all EU people be treated the same as those outside the EU...

But you can't help whole world at the same time, especially on a level seen in the EU.

You fail to notice we are doing a big step in smaller global place, rather than doing thousands of small steps, which wouldn't even be noticed in next few lifetimes.

Also, I wouldn't mind for the EU to expand more and even include countries which are not in Europe. You can't do that straight away but slowly expand and make lives easier for more and more people in the world.

&gt;Rather promote integration. Not allow immigration without integration, and to promote EU immigration on par to the rest of the world.

Good laugh. Bullshit. You guys show selfish approach, where only UK matters. Cheap goods - fine. Controlled cheap migration - fine. Importing best people from the world-fine. Absolutely no global view on increasing standards and profits not only in the UK.

&gt;Nothing that couldn't be achieved outside a Free Trade Deal outside the EU.

Like free and easy movement?

&gt;We could still recruit the people we need.

And again, UK being in the EU still can recruit people from whole world, yet struggles to have enough staff in NHS. Why is that?

&gt;Your priority for the NHS seems to be around supporting EU staff; whereas I'm more concerned about what is best for the NHS - and recruiting where is best (EU inclusive)

true,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;The ex-MP from Dartmoor blamed “quite militant secularism” and equality legislation for people feeling they could not express their faith.

Right. But they CAN express it. So... what's the problem? 

&gt;Christians now had started “suppressing the expression of conscience”.

Right... you mean that Christians are not 'allowed' to be openly homophobic, right? Yeah... yeah they CAN still be. People might not like it, but saying ""being gay is wrong and evil"" is still legal to say. Go ahead and say it Ann, we might judge you, but no one will arrest you.

Unless you mean something else? Like what? Go ahead Ann. Just come out and say it.

&gt; “Christians now have quite a lot of problems, whether it’s that you can’t display even very discreet small symbols of your faith at work,

Is this a 'problem', though? Bearing in mind that a metal cross on a chair or broach or whatever is not ACTUALLY a part of the faith, and bearing in mind only a few places of business have uniform policies that strict. I mean... if you want to fight to get it put into law that symbols of faith must be allowed then go for it! But currently places of employment set the policy. 

&gt;that you can’t say ’God bless you’, 

Yes you can. You literally can. Someone might frown and think it a bit out of the ordinary perhaps, but they're not going to arrest you, Ann.

&gt;you can’t offer to pray for somebody, 

Well, sure you can. If you're a doctor or a nurse it might not be very professional to say that to patients, and I guess you have to decide whether being professional or offering to pray for someone is more important to you.

&gt;if it’s an even bigger stance on conscience that you’re taking, some of the equality laws can actually bring you to the attention of the police themselves.

This is about being a homophobe, isn't it, Ann? Sigh... no you cannot stop gay men staying at your B&amp;B, Ann. I get why that upsets you. But we've all got to live by a set of rules. I guess that's something you'll have to fight the government for as well.

&gt;“So I think it is a very difficult country now, unlike when I was growing up, in which to be a Christian, an active Christian at any rate.”

Is it? Is it really 'difficult' now, Ann? Really? I mean... you have to let gays into your B&amp;B, which might make you feel icky perhaps, if you are that sort of person, but the rest all seems pretty trivial in the grand scheme. Heck, even that does.

&gt;the Conservative former politician said a concern about “political correctness” meant people were reluctant to express their faith to others because “they think strong belief offends them”.

It's your faith, Ann. Why do you care what anyone else thinks. 

&gt;Christians also faced a “sort of atheism” that “wouldn’t once have been said”.

Ok. So?

&gt;There used to be a view that “we’ve all got freedom of conscience, we’ve all got freedom of expression”, she said.

You have that. Except for the treating gays like lesser people, Ann. If that's what you mean?

&gt;“In the 1950s when plenty of people had lost lives and limbs and loved ones to the Nazis, it was still possible to be a Nazi in this country.

Was it, though? Really? I guess the Daily Mail supported the black shirts, if that's what you mean. Do you pine for those days, Ann? 

&gt;“When we were engaged in the height of the Cold War, when there were all those weapons lined up on the borders of the Warsaw Pact countries pointing straight at us, you could still, in this country, proclaim yourself as a Communist, you could still stand for Parliament for that matter as a Communist.

You know you can STILL BE A CHRISTIAN, right? You know the communists and Nazis and so on did not have national holidays devoted to them, or an official state religion to back them up, or official places of worship in every village, town and city? 

&gt;“You wouldn’t get in but you could stand. You could sell the Morning Star on street corners.

Christians can still stand for parliment, Ann. Seriously. Go check! 

&gt;“We have always respected, no matter how strongly we felt as a nation at the time, we’ve always respected the right of people to their own views and I do feel nowadays as a combination of political correctness and equality law and all the rest of it, we’ve started suppressing the expression of conscience.”

Rubbish. You can do all these things.

The people who supposedly couldn't wear a crucifix at work were hospital staff told to wear it under their uniform, not in the open where it might dangle over a patient and become an infection risk.

I'm not aware of any prohibition against saying ""God bless you"" after a sneeze or in any other situation.

And you _can_ ""offer to pray"" for somebody, but if it annoys them and they make a complaint to your employer, then you might be suspended or sacked when the complaint is investigated.

In the case of the teacher Olive Jones, she didn't just offer to pray but spoke a lot of metaphysical nonsense about dying and going to heaven to a 14-year-old leukaemia patient who was deeply upset by it. Jones carried on causing distress even after the child's parents told her to stop. That's why she was sacked.

This is because the faith was very popular with slaves and the urban poor in the Roman Empire, who were also oppressed. It also explains the faiths belief that suffering in this world opens the door to a better life in the next. The fact that the faith became the state religion of the Empire and it's successor states in the West doesn't quite fit this pattern, but it does explain why oppression and suffering feature so highly. 

&gt; It is also worth noting that the moment they weren't oppressed they started actively oppressing people themselves.

This is because people are assholes, and religion is a political and power issue as much as it is a matter of faith. You see the same pattern in many faiths, and even in militant atheism where a small number of the ""enlightened"" see it as their duty to seek out people with faith and attack them for it.

Not that I think Ann Widdecombe is right, quite the opposite actually - she's talking complete bollocks, but consider her hardline Christian point of view: 

* They are right and the bible has a very manichean outlook. The bible is God's word on earth and they are his servants. The bloom in lifestyle choices, rising atheism and increased diversity of beliefs/philosophies in the last 30 or so years has taken them from being an implicit cultural hegemony of goodness to being beset on all sides by evil. 
* Spreading the faith is *the best favour they can do for anyone*. They're literally saving your soul. Showing the cross, starting conversations with you about it, encouraging people to seek God - these are all part of that process. There is no place and no time where God isn't appropriate, which is why Widdecombe believes there's no justification to saying ""stfu, I'm trying to work and I don't want to know about your beliefs"".
* Their social values have evolved over time, whether they realise it or not, but they are inherently more conservative (note: small ""C"") than the UK's centrists. Socially conservative people often have a tendancy to feel as though their values are threatened and that, to some degree, the values of the past are superior in some respect. 

Not that any of the above stops most Christians from being nice people. Most don't think like Widdecombe at all and are amongst the most friendly and welcoming people I've ever met. It's their leaders (evidenced anecdotally by the sermon I attended) who often think like Widdecombe, I'm guessing because the kinds of people who like to climb hierarchical power structures see the world in terms of conflict and defined groups/cliques/tribes.",0,1402310280,null,0,false,0,ci2velx,t3_27ojwo,t1_ci2velx,t1_ci2ttlq,null,1434158042,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You do know we pay 2 types people to determine the real world effects of policies? Politicians and Economists. The former know very little but think they know a lot (and some of them do in fairness) while the latter know a lot but often get ignored. 

We pay Politicians to provide representation for the majority of views in their constituency - this simple job description is often lost on MP's but most noticeably the conservative MP's. If you have a look at the commons voting data you'll see that Tory MP's (especially new ones) *very* rarely vote against the party.

Take my pal Rt Hon James Wharton as an example. He promised to listen to the community in fact that's pretty much what his campaign about. Do you know what he's done for his constituency since he's been an MP? Nothing that benefits the majority. There's a small village near me called Yarm. For as long as I can remember parking in the high street has been completely free apart from about 1/4 of it being disc parking (introduced by another tory MP way back when) Now if you want to spend a couple of hours having lunch in one of the nice restaurants or browsing the boutiques you'll have to pay £2 for the privilege. It's not a lot of money, but you've got to remember this was free. A lot of people work in Yarm and many of them are on minimum wage - bar workers, waiters, cleaners etc. if they work 5 days a week that's £40 a month out of their pocket *just* to get to work. Is that fair and thought out?

On top of that it cost the council around £500,000 to implement the scheme. Half a million that could have been spent on repairing the roads or schools or anything else than making people's lives more difficult. 

You know what's the real stab in the back though, the real cunting deal breaker? Hes the biggest hypocrite I've ever had the misfortune to speak to. He was photo'd ""supporting"" Yarm resident's but he's the one who pushed the scheme through!

Know what's even worse? The man is gay - this isn't a bad thing, but he voted *against* gay marriage despite the majority of the population of his constituency wanting it to go through! If a man is going to sell out his own beliefs and those of the people he represents then why would anyone in their right mind want that person representing them?

This type of behavior is pretty epidemic within the conservative party. There's literally hundreds of stories of Tory Mp's meeting with business leaders to get them out of tax in return for a spot on the board. 

How about the sale of Royal mail? Post prices fixed for 3 years? They've already gone up. How they didn't see that coming is mind boggling unless they were, ya know, in on it.

Utilities and Energy companies are taking the piss too, as a home owner every year it gets more and more expensive just to live in my house. 

What we need are national institutions for **BASIC NEEDS** like gas and electric to set a baseline price so the market is driven by competition rather than closed door meetings because currently pal, it's a fucking disgrace. 

The conservatives always forget what a board of directors jobs are: To generate shareholder value through year on year growth. What are two ways to secure YoY growth? Gain customers (a finite resource in the industry) or put their prices up. 

Do you think RM is going to have anymore customers than they had before? Or do you think their prices are just going to rise year on year? (yes I know the prices have risen anyway but that's largely inline with inflation.) The reason why interlink, DHL and other private firms have low prices and better service is because they had to compete with the government, now that that's not true I'll put money on it that in 5 years times the price of posting a parcel will jump out of line with inflation. I'm going to say the cost will be about 120% higher than they are now. 

You say the socialist policies presented above haven't been ""overwhelmingly"" successful for Britain. But you concede that they have been successful. In contrast the Tory policy at the moment seems to be ""let's hide it and hope it goes away.""
[Case and point with unemployment](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/14/uk-unemployment-underemployed-tuc) 

How about the ""economic growth"" we're experiencing? [Looks like it's down to borrowing money and filtering it](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/10709115/Budget-2014-Britains-false-recovery-is-a-credit-mirage-unlike-real-recovery-in-the-US.html) 

I don't like using newspapers as sources, but if you've got access to a university library you'll find academic reports which back these claims up. 

I dare say this is hardly ""overwhelmingly"" successful.

Other facts you may have missed:
[NHS waiting times have consistently gone up](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/20/nhs-hospitals-failing-meet-targets-waiting-times-treatment) Experts believe because the NHS is being forced to be more ""business focused"" rather than providing a public service.

Emergency services have had their budgets cut

Academies that ""put power back into parent's hands"" have been condemned because of the system abuse. Not just from religious nuts but corruption, poor testing scores, iron fist etc etc.

The list goes on and on while you sit there saying ""the conservatives are the best option for the country"". They're not unless you earn over £70000 PA - do you earn that much? because if you don't I'd seriously consider changing your vote.

It's all smoke and mirrors so they are free to line their own pockets. I'll say it again: Conservatives for the selfish who don't believe in helping their fellow man or their nation. Labour for those who actually care about the country, other people and their own money.

The forgers of the US constitution knew this, which is why they deliberately set out to place strong limits on it, and to restrict it to the political sphere keeping it it out of the economic one as far as was possible.  As time has gone on, and corporations/the wealthiest have secured for themselves the largest percentage of the wealth since the jazz age, they've been seeking to reverse the gains made by generations of people using their votes.

&gt;Yet, doctors from ""bad"" universities still get employment in the UK and they have exactly the same way of getting into employment as others. 

Because we have a minimum standard and we can still improve, but if you think you're guaranteed work because you graduate...sorry.  No.  Doesn't work like that.  In fact a while back there was even a protest march based on just that.

&gt;Is is while the UK is a part of that global initiative. Just like UK helps other countries by having overseas aid. Of course you could argue UK wouldn't have to do and participate in any of these.... but that's for the whole nation to decide (and understand first) and would be pretty selfish.

This is incomprehensible.

&gt;But we get to first topic, which was that it's easier to get doctors from the EU or doctors from the EU have easier way to get into work in the UK (both quite different things).

Borderline incomprehensible.

Lots of doctors come to the NHS from outside the EU.  The majority of those not trained in the UK, in fact.  If they can manage this visa-labyrinth in their literal hundreds and thousands, then I'm sure their EU counterparts when put on the same footing will manage just fine.

&gt;Not being in the EU would mean less EU doctors. Simple

Why?

Are you asking us to believe that when put on the same level as non-EU doctors the EU ones would simply give up or get confused?   

That somehow they wouldn't be able to cope with what Indian, Pakistani and South African doctors already do so well.

&gt;But you can't help whole world at the same time, especially on a level seen in the EU.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW?  You've just gone off on another tangent.  You can't hold a conversation.  It's almost schizophrenic.

Who gives a shit about helping the whole world?  We're not hiring doctors from the EU to help the EU, or nurses from the Philippines out of some altruistic gesture.  We're hiring for the NHS to help the UK.

&gt;Good laugh. Bullshit. **You guys show selfish approach, where only UK matters. Cheap goods - fine. Controlled cheap migration - fine. Importing best people from the world-fine. Absolutely no global view on increasing standards and profits not only in the UK.**

You're goddamn RIGHT (on the first part)!

My priority is the NHS.   It is the UK
Your priority seems to be what you can get out of it.  The very system that you've moved countries to be employed by you now criticise.  If we did it your way we wouldn't have a system.

You know what does raise standards and make profits for other people globally?  A strong, trading G8 member.

&gt;But you fail to acknowledge point above that non-EU staff can still be hired but NHS is lacking staff.... and if Brexit happened, there would certainly be less EU doctors, so doctors in general.... leading to more staff shortages.  

Broken logic.  

It simply implies we need to hire more and extend more visas.

Gove takes the view that ""extremism"" should be defined as almost anything which might be considered a bit dodgy in the view of someone like Gove, so to speak. May and the Home Office consider that extremism is where someone actually does extremist things - mildy more sensible.

So in various meetings where this letter and other issues were debated, Gove kept losing to May because Gove's POV is a bit, well, extreme.

Gove - being not happy about this - then briefed a bunch of Sunday Times journalists about what a softy the Home Office was on Extremism. As a result the Sunday Times asked for a comment from the Home Office and got a leaked letter in which the HO accused the DofE of failing to act more quickly on reports of extremism in schools in Birmingham. Both Gove's and the HO response are well outside how cabinet ministers are supposed to act.

I'm not sure the comments section on the DM website accurately represent the views of the average DM reader.

I know an awful lot of people who read and comment on the DM who aren't your typical DM readers, but they do it because it's a different point of view (not necessarily one they agree with, but that's a part of thinking critically).

Weed is quite an emotional topic too. A lot of people feel strongly about it and will go out of their way to share their view. If someone were to post a DM article about weed being bad on here, I imagine some reddit readers would go along and leave their opinion in the comment section, despite not being readers, whereas, the stereotypical DM reader wouldn't know what that there interwebz even is.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying the DM isn't leaning toward legalisation, just saying that the tone of the comment section isn't necessarily a reliable indicator.

I think whether or not the black market remains an issue all depends on how legalisation was implemented. If they legalise it and tax it and only allow licensed growers, ending up the same price as current black market prices, then the black market will continue. 

If they legalise personal growing and personal small sales between individuals such that it becomes available for a price so low that the black market can barely profit off it, then it may not continue so strongly.",0,1402318985,null,0,false,0,ci2xbej,t3_27onvk,t1_ci2xbej,t1_ci2wvh3,null,1434158942,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Whats the point in an integrated school if one set of parents are demanding that anything even remotely linked to the other culture is banned? Parents must be made aware that integrated means there are at least two cultures there, and if they don't like it, they are free to send their kids to non-integrated education.

There is a suspicion in some Nationalist families that these 'integrated' schools are going to be used as a tool by some to make sure there is no Irish culture available to kids at all.

I imagine a lot of established smokers will stick with their long term supplier, either because they're mates, or more convenient.

I think these days, most cities have a dial-a-dealer or 2: 1 phone call to a random number and a guy turns up at your door within a few hours with some suitable smoke.  Either that, or people know a friend or colleague of family member who grows, so they get good value, reliable stuff, with provenance - neither of these groups have an incentive to switch to buying over priced heavily taxed stuff from a shop a few miles away (although those 2 groups obviously don't include everyone).

If it does turn out to be really expensive legitimately, there's a chance that it may benefit black market dealers: people try weed legitimately at the new outlets, realise they like it, realise they're paying far too much in tax, and instead turn to the black market dealers (which will be easier to find because their trade will be seen as a lot less criminal and more legitimate).

Ultimately, it really does depend on how they do it. I think some people see legalisation as a silver bullet that will automagically solve all problems. I don't think many people consider how badly implemented legalisation could be.

Most people don't have a problem with Muslims.

People DO have a problem with segregating children in school, religious dress codes, forced prayers and other such things.

And people DO have a problem with aspects of Muslim religion (and culture which comes along with it) such as forced marriages, homophobia, genital mutilation etc.

It's a very different thing to dislike a religion and to dislike people. Personally I do not like Islam. I think it's a horrible religion, controlling, powerfully brainwashing people, with many out-dated practices. It has stubbornly refused to modernise, and many practices make actual integration impossible (such as forbidding marriage between muslims and non-muslims). But I have no problem with Muslims, if they practice their religion quietly, live a decent life and don't push homophobia and other prejudices onto people.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Except I don't often see many ""native"" non-religious Brits make much of an effort to be welcoming to Muslims or engage with them in any way

When people immigrate to this country they have a choice, they can take part in the culture of the UK, and become part of the community, or they can become insular, join other immigrants from the same place, not take part in the culture of the UK. 

For the first group, it is very easy for people to be welcoming and engage with them. There are thousands of people who's families have come from predominately Muslim countries who have accepted UK culture and are not completely integrated, still able to keep up tier own traditions, but in a way that does not run counter to UK values.

For the second group, it is much harder for them to be accepted by the wider community, if they do not accept the wider community themselves, weather it be through intentional choice, or because of pressure from the people around them.

&gt;but I've personally experienced the dark side of Christian fundamentalist domination in a school.

I haven't said that Catholic education is perfect, but on the whole it is  lot better than a lot of the alternatives. There is a reason that there is so much competition to get into Catholic schools.

I think this is a really bad idea.

I totally get the sentiment behind it, I'm pro-legalisation, and I'm all for raising awareness, but surely doing this sort of thing just feeds into people's fears over cannabis and legalisation? I can hear them now: ""The dirty hippies have planted drugs all over the streets! Protect our children! Bring back mandatory minimum sentencing!""

People are irrationally afraid of cannabis, how is planting the stuff all over Teeside going to help with these attitudes? It's just going to make the situation worse, and I actually think it's very irresponsible to make cannabis freely available by essentially leaving it around in the streets. Sure, no one is going to die, but if even one kid gets hold of one of these plants it's bad news for them and for us.

THAT is your justification? You don't have a ""battery swapping machine""? Yeah, it's called a human being with a spanner, you fuckwit.

The cost of batteries is prohibitive right now, but competition and demand will bring those costs down. They can get away with charging $45 grand for the car and $10 grand for a spare battery because it's not in large demand.

Anyway, think about it. A $10 grand battery is what, about 6,500 quid? And petrol is about 6.50 a gallon? 1000 gallons (assume 28 thousand miles worth) and you're break even. I know many people who could do that in a couple of years, after that you're essentially getting free mileage.

What's actually happening is that oil is getting vastly more expensive to extract.  The cost of getting a barrel of oil out of the ground has been rising by about 10% annually since 2005.  Big oil firms are spending vastly more on capital expenditure (i.e getting oil) and are seeing profits slashed.  They're cancelling big projects everywhere.  Statoil had to borrow money to pay their dividend this year!  Many of the majors are divesting themselves of large assets.  Profits are down, despite record high oil prices.

Besides that many people won't even change a spare wheel or their lead acid battery starter battery let alone doing their cars half ton plus main power source twice a day with a spanner.

Battery are pretty in demand right now and have been for the last decade. With current battery alchemies using rare earth metals prices can't really go down in the long term. *With current technology*

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"I don't think it's trivial to have a distinction between the two.

Prebooking is fine, but ensuring that the pre-booking is made at a fixed price is also an important part of that.  Using a 'live' meter is clearly a black cab.

That means they either need to ditch the meter for Uber, or the high fees that black cabbies have to pay, [namely the knowledge, as well as the expensive viechles required to fit the licensing constraints.](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/become-a-taxi-licensee/apply-for-a-taxi-vehicle-licence)

So I completely understand why they are upset.

If Uber is only competing against the pre-booked market, do they need a meter feature in their app?  It's kind of like the whole fixed vs floating that is the basis of any swap.

I'm not aware of any developed capital city that doesn't place restrictions on taxi drivers.  You want to ensure they are all vetted, they often carry people in a 'vulnerable' state.  Hell they used to advertise the whole *get an unlicensed cab, get raped* thing.

So we either have to look at reforming the restrictions, should taxi drivers have to have the knowledge in the days of GPS?  Do the vehicle requirements need to be so tough?

The other problem is many people speculate that Taxi Drivers often dodge taxes, their meter record isn't linked against any declared earnings.  Uber my understanding is will prevent such dodging.  As many black cabs don't take anything but cash, one out right told me that he has no intention of doing card because of *the paper trail* when I mentioned I'd need a cash point, I can see there being a lot of vested interests.  A quick google has forums with drivers claiming they earn £60-80k per year depending on the hours they do.  That's a very nice pay rise if you don't declare all of it.

There are definitely two issues here, one of a government mandated requirement of training for anything with a meter.  I honestly do not think they are being pissy about this, it appears that uber must legally not do that.

Surely you mean specifically the parents of children who go the the schools. Because what would the whole Muslim community know of what was going on in these schools? Does every local catholic know what is going on at the local Catholic school? 

If the whole Muslim community is saying that the report is wrong, surely that shows they are being defensive and insular, and are defending the schools despite having no knowledge of what is going on there. What value is an opinion like that?

 &gt;because obviously you're right, and the Muslim parents, students, and staff of Birmingham, have got this wrong

Or alternatively, why do the parents and students think they understand how a school should be run better than Ofsted do? 

&gt;They should be blaming the teachers, and governors that they know and respect, 

They may know them, but that doesn't mean they are doing what is best for the children's education. You should be more concerned with ensuring the children get the best education they can, and not worry about defending people who are trying to disrupt that for their own personal reasons.

Even then, with all these aids, there are lots of things FD won't do.  These don't occur much when flying, but do all the time when driving.  An airplanes autopilot or Flight Director, will have a bunch of pre-programmed way points as the flight plan, ATC will then ensure separation between airplanes, asking them to adjust heading, altitude and speed as required, the pilot adjusts the FD with these commands.  This is fairly simple and when you are cruising over the Atlantic there is little change to it.  But when you get some idiot flying VFR (not required to be talking to ATC) with an older transponder (these are detected by the ground only, not the aircraft) into the airspace ahead, then the auto pilot can do nothing.  The sack of mostly water must make the changes as ATC works hard to separate the traffic, this is the equivalent of a kid running out into the road.  The auto pilot wouldn't *provide separation* (aka not fly the fuck into it) as it wouldn't know it was there.*

Self driving cars on the other hand, we kind of expect that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;An M Sport doesn't necessarily handle like an M5, it handles like a stiffened up 5 series.

Yes, the 'M Sport' label is almost entirely just a trim level.

And a stiffened up 5 Series is still a BMW. It's still going to handle very well indeed.

&gt;The Tesla has a favourable weight distribution

But it's fantastically heavy, and hasn't been designed by a car company renowned for building cars that are sporty right across the range.

&gt;is supposed to handle incredibly well

The issue with this is that the vast majority of Tesla reviews are by Americans.

The Telegraph said that 'the Tesla doesn’t traverse bumps well, with poor damping control, a choppy ride quality and an unpleasant, darty feel to the steering, which conveys almost no feedback. Speed up and it gets worse, with the wheels running out of rebound travel and the car crashing over crests.'

&gt; If you wanted to cruise in Germany, a big BMW is an obvious choice but I'm not sure it makes a better British car except for people who regularly do long journeys

The 5 Series is not just some cruising barge. I think the BMW engineers would be extremely offended by that claim. All models in the range are known for having good, sporty handling.

&gt;I can't see why you'd want the firm ""M sport"" suspension, a more wafty model would be better.

For taking A road corners?

&gt;Most British car journeys are almost too short to need a car for at all and for that

I'm not sure what you're trying to say? The BMW is too much for the average British journey but the slightly larger and more cumbersome Tesla is?

&gt;a lovely quiet environment

I have absolutely no doubt that the BMW will be quieter, it's much better built, and several reviews have complained about shockingly bad tyre noise in the Tesla. It's not all about engine noise.

Yes, lots of torque is good, which is why the 535d has more than the Tesla P85+.

&gt;It's difficult to compare the two, as they're completely different things with different design objectives.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; people like that, they exist pretty much entirely to cause suffering to others, because that's what they enjoy doing, that's what sociopaths are

This is a pat, convenient and completely baseless load of bullshit.  Some people are perfectly ""normal"", well-rounded people who just happen to have some *really fucked up* ideas on particular subjects.

Hitler had a girlfriend, and they would sometimes sit around over breakfast discussing what they were going to do that day instead of planning to exterminate all the Jews.

Osama bin Laden had a family and kids, and enjoyed taking his family on picnics in the desert, instead of spending all his time twirling his moustache and planning the deaths of infidel westerners.

Just because someone is capable of doing really horrific things, that doesn't *necessarily* make them a raving, sadistic, insatiable cartoon bad guy - that assumption is convenient and comforting, but it's also immature, over-emotional and almost always totally inaccurate.

It's also worth considering *why* it's so tempting for us to assume this about them - in a nutshell it's because we have a strong instinctive drive to punish wrongdoers and those who contravene social taboos, but we also have a strong empathic instinct that makes us feel uncomfortable when we hurt (or advocate hurting) others.

The easiest way to satisfy both drives is to carefully dehumanise the transgressor before advocating harm (or harming) them - we first mentally reclassify them as something less than human, chopping off any inconvenient bits that might cause us to think of them as human, removing any sense of depth or nuance from their character, flattening them into a two-dimensional image and simplistically redefining them as some childish cartoon character entirely defined by their worst attributes or impulses.  Then, having carefully rendered them profoundly less than human we can do pretty much whatever we like to them without feeling bad about it.

Here's the thing - **that's exactly the same process that monsters like this use to inflict violence on their victims**.  In his mind this guy didn't throw alkali in a *person's* face - he threw it in the face of *a symbol of gayness*.  By his moral code homosexuality was wrong - gays weren't people; they were non-human symbols of deviance and immorality... and not being human, they didn't get the basic empathy that we recognise human beings intuitively deserve.

Likewise you didn't advocate killing a human being with hopes and fears and dreams and emotions - you first carefully and totally baselessly dehumanised him:

&gt; it takes a particular kind of person... people like that, they exist pretty much entirely to cause suffering... that's what they enjoy doing, that's what sociopaths are... what's the point in keeping someone like that alive?

and then advocated *the casual killing of another human being* purely on the basis of your convenient (but totally baseless) redefinition of them as less than human.

The question isn't ""what's the point of keeping them alive"" - they're a *fucking human being* - they have an *inalienable right* to life, and it's up to anyone else to argue why - in extreme circumstances, when it's provably for the greater good of society - that right should regretfully be taken away.

The guy who did this is an asshole and a cunt of the first order, and he should rot in jail for very, very many years.  His morals are fucked, and do not in any way conform to the morals which I suspect you and I both share, and which are the consensus morals of the society in which he lives.

However, in so casually dehumanising him and asking others to justify his continued existence, you are guilty of *exactly the same* internal propaganda and abhorrent mental gymnastics as those that let monsters like this harm innocent people *they* hate and fear and condemn.

Think on that, before you presume to so casually dehumanise someone, judge them and sentence them to death from your comfortable, blithely-assumed moral high ground.",0,1402327211,null,0,1402344821,0,ci30emq,t3_27ox2s,t1_ci30emq,t1_ci2yqcd,null,1434160465,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Taxi Drivers are also meant to be a bit like tourist information too.

Nope.  Or rather NAFAIK.

&gt;You are also exempt if your vehicle is a minicab or taxi, licensed with London Taxi and Private Hire (TPH).

Now given that I see so many bangers with their private hire sticker, I'm guessing they don't have to pass anything, except maybe the LEZ stuff, which realistically any car will.

&gt; it harms the consumer in the end.

Taxing private car travel is often seen as *progressive* because only the richer types use it.

&gt;I think with Uber, where people can rate the drivers and you know which driver will get you, your journey is recorded, people can check up on you etc. it is really far safer than even the licensing system. Such records also prevent tax dodging.

I'm in favour in many ways of that, I think our regulations hark back to a system that is very out of date.

&gt;I just think that all of the legitimate concerns that lead to the licensing regime have been solved by technology and now it's time to accept that and allow consumers to benefit from the progress.

We where taught history fairly evenhandedly, for the most part; from what i can remember it was WW1 stuff, the biggest impression left on me was the mindless slaughter of it all. Teachers **Never** went off script.  R.E the dullest of all subjects, i barely remember except when we watched the biopic film of Gandhi.

The most bizarre scenario i remember was when Martin McGuinness was first appointed Education Minister that protestant schools actively allowed pupils to march up to my former school and many others to [Protest against his appointment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/554187.stm). It was highly organised and clearly orchestrated by parents and ""educators"" though denied at the time.

It was batshit insane that these people were effectively trying to initiate sectarian violence among school children, thankfully the Catholic Schools chained the gates and carried on as normal.

But in Bulgaria they don't have minimum standards and actually use witchcraft to heal people? You are ridiculous.

&gt;if you think you're guaranteed work because you graduate...sorry

I haven't said that. I'm only pointing to the fact UK citizens are now treated on equal terms as EU citizens in relation to employment, without the need to fulfil extra criteria, visas, permits, sponsorship... or other time consuming crap.

&gt;This is incomprehensible.

What is? That UK helps both in the EU (by currently giving more than receiving due to being richer, yet having all other EU positives)? Or that the UK also helps non-EU countries using that fund, which consists of our taxes, yet having much less control and no positives as compared with the EU.

The point was that UK already helps others... but of course can change it as it is not obliged to be in the EU, nor to send any financial aid to non-EU countries.

&gt;Lots of doctors come to the NHS from outside the EU. The majority of those not trained in the UK, in fact. If they can manage this visa-labyrinth in their literal hundreds and thousands, then I'm sure their EU counterparts when put on the same footing will manage just fine.

Jesus, mate. You are terribly hard to discuss stuff with. I'm NOT saying that EU doctors will NOT be coming to the UK to work, in line 100% less of them. I'm saying that if visa requirements were to be put up, there would CERTAINLY be a decrease in their numbers. As UK currently has shortages, even though it gets EU and non-EU doctors, making it harder for EU doctors to get employment here would mean DECREASE in immigrant doctors overall. But hell, you prefer moaning about other stuff and can't accept that simple argument which is just ridiculously obvious.

&gt;Are you asking us to believe that when put on the same level as non-EU doctors the EU ones would simply give up or get confused?

Yes, look above. I'm not saying 100% less but obviously some figure less, just like people would travel less to places where they know it's hard to get a visa to, as compared to other place where they don't have a visa (unless of course something much different is offered in that place).

&gt;Who gives a shit about helping the whole world? We're not hiring doctors from the EU to help the EU, or nurses from the Philippines out of some altruistic gesture

But you forgot UK is in the EU partially because of that, to have those altruistic gestures and help those poorer EU countries. It's obviously not one sided though but that's how it currently works, otherwise UK would object from the very beginning to the financial system of the EU as in richer countries pay more than poorer ones!

&gt;It simply implies we need to hire more and extend more visas.

Yet, it doesn't happen and NHS is having staff shortages.

Oh, one more thing. There was an article few weeks ago about number of complaints in relation to UK and foreign doctors. I don't remember if they said non-EU doctors or immigrant doctors in general. Their service was of lower standards than British doctors...... so maybe that whole idea ""of the best"" doesn't really work and rather than rely on foreign staff, UK should do something about having more local people to work in NHS?

I think the real issue facing feminism is most of these gender imbalances are mutual and mutually harmful. You can't deal with the issue of men taking part in child rearing without also taking on the issues of imbalanced rulings in custody cases, the paedophilia scare and how it harms men, inequality of parental leave, etc. The whole system is one great mishmash of harmful bullshit that is intertwined.

Fixing male non-existence in parenting without dealing with the paedophile scare would be horrific and needlessly painful. This would require men to take on a role where they will routinely be the subject of quite public revulsion and distrust from a minority (of men and women BTW). If you want to involve more men in actual parenting then the first step has to be putting an end to the idea that men interested in child care have something wrong with them and are to be distrusted.",0,1402329403,null,0,false,0,ci31ez0,t3_27p1ca,t1_ci31ez0,t1_ci2zku0,null,1434160945,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

No it is used as an international species currency. All species currencies are subject to market reality. Otherwise tulip growers would be the richest people on the planet.

There is absolutely no difference between an insane property boom that takes prices beyond the capabilities of tenants and a tulip boom that makes it functionally stupid to actually plant a tulip for the fact they look nice.

It is hard to see how people possibly think otherwise. In my lifetime we've had not one but two earth shattering crashes in the property market.

But Uber doesn't provide that service.  This is the issue, this is why the protectionist (which I dislike btw!) say we need to offer that level of service.  I dare say most tourists would save as much as a roaming data bundle costs, compared to taking a cab but there you go.

Also, it doesn't address the requirements presently put on black cabs, namely accessibility (disabled, prams etc) and turning circle.  Uber drivers don't buy these expensive things.

&gt; I think they should let them enter the taxi pedestrianised zones, but not use bus lanes. But I'm sure far more knowledgeable people have a more informed opinion.

That idea terrifies me!  If you drive or cycle around London, look at how many of the cars have private hire stickers, letting all of those into the most protected areas, I don't think that would be good thing.

&gt; I think they should let them enter the taxi pedestrianised zones, but not use bus lanes. But I'm sure far more knowledgeable people have a more informed opinion

For me it boils down to are they providing a non minicab style service, the meter argument suggests they are providing a more taxicab style one.  If that is the case, then we need to look at our regulations that they fail to meet.

* Emissions
* Access
* Turning Circle
* The Knowledge

Personally I think the knowledge still has its place for tourists for a while yet, ask me again in 5 years, I might say something different, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone invests in passing it, but for now, today I think it's worth protecting.

Unless Uber and similar can meet all these criteria, I don't think they should be allowed to encroach on space reserved for those who do.

I think the simplest thing is for Uber to switch to a fixed price per journey model.  All the taxi drivers can then just shut up with their complaints.",0,1402330147,null,0,false,0,ci31rly,t3_27p464,t1_ci31rly,t1_ci316g9,null,1434161105,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I think the way you're approaching the squad is a bit too rigid. We have to remember that our squad was incredibly thin this last season and we were very lucky to not have too many major injuries.

We have to add a lot of quality, a number of players will be rotated through various competitions, etc.

As for Sterling, I don't think you can really say he's - or anyone, really - being *relegated* to bench, I think Rodgers will simply play the player who is the best fit for the squad and against a particular opponent.

true,Lastaria,cnty-england,England - Liverpool,"In the early to mid 80's there were two comedies that got me into uncontrollable fits of giggles. And those shows were The Young Ones and Blackadder.

There were other comedies we watched as a family back then such as Hi-De-Hi, Allo Allo, The Good Life. But none of these made me laugh like these two comedies did.

And of course Rik Mayall was a big part of this.

The Young Ones had a big impression on a 6 year old me. It had plenty of adult humour that at the time I did not understand. But at the same time a lot of childish slapstick humour which would have me laughing all the way through. Rik's performance in this was outstanding. And though he repeated similar comedy later in the likes of Bottom, it never quite captured the pure anarchy humour the Young Ones had for me.

Likewise Blackadder, still my joint favourite (with Red Dwarf) comedy of all time. Had some very good adult humour, but also much that a young child could appreciate. And though Rik was in it very little. When he showed up as Flashheart he stole the show. Which is no mean feat considering the many great talented actors and comedians there. At the time he was by far my favourite character on the show.

So I am very sad to hear of Rik Mayall's death. A man who helped form my early sense of humour and thus will always have a special place for me.",0,1402331425,null,0,false,0,ci32dv1,t3_27p7yj,t1_ci32dv1,t3_27p7yj,null,1434161398,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;

&gt;Based on the characters from the very popular BBC television series, __Doctor Who: Adventures in Time And Space__ is a roleplaying game by UK games publisher, Cubicle 7 Entertainment. It allows roleplayers to adopt the role of characters from the very popular BBC science fiction television programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*.

&gt;The first edition of the game focuses on the David Tennant era of the show (December 2005 – January 2010), although supplements are said to be in the works to cover other incarnations of the world's most popular time traveller, as well as a rebranded and revised core rules box set for the Matt Smith era (2010–2013). 

&gt;The core rules box set was released to critical acclaim in the fall of 2009. It has gone on to win two awards including the Grog d'Or for Best Roleplaying Game 2010 and the UK Game Expo Best Roleplaying Game 2010.  It was also nominated for the Origins Best Roleplaying Game 2010, the ENnies Product of the Year 2010, the Golden Geek Game of the Year 2010, and the Golden Geek Best Artwork &amp; Presentation 2010.
&gt;The core rules box set includes the following content:

&gt;


&gt;* Player's Guide

&gt;* Gamemaster's Guide

&gt;* Adventure Book

&gt;* Quick Start Guide

&gt;* Character sheets, including pre-generated characters for the series cast

&gt;* Gadget cards

&gt;* Story Point tokens

&gt;* 6 six-sided dice

&gt;As of November 2010 [update], three products had been released including the 1st edition core rules box set, a Game Master's screen, and a box set supplement entitled ""Aliens and Creatures"".

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"I would say there are two forces in the London property Market, and they need to be viewed separately, not as a whole.

No one who is looking to buy a place in the Shard, is ever going to give my poxy place a look.  It's liquidity I dare say would be uncorrelated to that of the shard.  The best *proof* I can give for my speculation, is how poorly they've been selling in the shard, compared to flats round me (on the market for two weeks is a long time).

As a result, mean prices that take into account the insanity of some of the status buildings, the black tulips, I think need to almost be discarded.  No one cares about rental return on something like that, it's a status pad, pure and simple.

However, something like my flat ultimately is a product of speculation, borrow rates vs what people will pay for rent.

I'm hoping that Cross Rail will help deflate London a bit (probably at the expense of areas as far away as Reading) because more people will be willing to travel further outside of London.  I fear however, it is simply too little, too late.

So long as people are willing to pay £2k a month in rent, for a two bed in a 30 min commute zone, rates are low enough that borrowing a few hundred thousand doesn't cost much, and people are bullish on the overall trend of properties such as theirs, then we aren't going to see a fall.  Many renters vote with their wallet, they'd rather spend a huge portion of their income, live in a house share etc, than have a longer commute.

Until we see a line of rent to income ratio that people aren't willing to pay, become crossed, we won't see a significant downward adjustment in housing in the 'normal person' end of the market.

I think you guys need to decide which kind of properties you are referring too, because I personally don't think they follow remotely similar trends.

It is also worth noting a lot of outside money has bought small properties, this is based on my highly accurate server of 7 flats in one building, 3 are foreign national owned.",0,1402331796,null,0,false,0,ci32kdp,t3_27p4n4,t1_ci32kdp,t1_ci324nz,null,1434161482,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"Oh I think we're talking slightly at cross services.

The argument for regulation, is that it provides a certain level of service at a minimum.  I'm able bodied, I hope I'll never need a wheel chair, however every time I take a black cab, I'm paying for the fact he can accommodate one.  Market forces would not make it viable for everyone to have a ramp I'd suggest, this is easy to see in the private hire side of things.

My point is that wheel chair ramps and helping tourists are kind of the same thing.  Myself, as it turns out I'll have Sunday to kill in Paris alone :( will be buying a data pack or similar, I'll have the offline maps on my phone and just use public transport.  But I'm not the average tourist.  If we want to keep our friendly image, part of that is the black cab being like a tourist information kiosk, friendly enough, helpful enough.

This is why the knowledge is demanded despite the march of GPS, because for some use cases, it is desirable. 

If we want to have pick up, meter paid services, we have to protect them reasonably enough.  Otherwise they will be in too low supply.  This is the protectionist argument (plz note, I almost hate typing this, because consider myself a filthy, greedy, heartless neo-lib).

 &gt; I just don't think we should prevent Uber and similar (eventually better) such companies from entering the market

I don't disagree at all.  If they have a fixed price system, they are perfectly welcome too.  Hell I'd even heckle some black cabs if they were protesting about them.  As my previous comment might suggest, I do think they are a bunch of tax dodging swine, and after one took me all round the houses coming back from LCY once, I'm don't even think the current regulation is fit for purpose, let alone perfect (that was an interesting argument, he suggested that as I was going to be expensing it to my employer, I should just shut up...  Yeah, my employer is far to tight to let a £80 fair slide by).

If we want the pros, the on street pickup, the disabled access, the knowledge, then we have to ensure that others aren't unfairly allowed to erode it.  I reckon you'd save a fair few car with a different vehicle over a licensed black cab, minicab drivers, and Uber ones, appear to concur.

true,banjochicken,null,null,"&gt; thanks man. the NottsProgs sounds great. I'm signed up to some Coursesa stuff to help me, kind of difficult to get that on the CV or cover letter as something legit. Yet it's good none the less. Algorithms start soon and a Linux one just for kicks.

Having Coursera on it would be better than not putting it on there, especially with no CS degree to back you up.

&gt; My main issue is getting applications done, I worry about complexity for example. Too complex and it's daunting (even if it's just a mass CRUD), too simple and I think they'll ignore me. Then it's coming up with ideas themselves, something I've never been good at no matter the field.

There are two ways of thinking about this; complexity shows you can manage something difficult, but will a recruiter/hiring manager quickly look through all the code and be able to understand why you do something one way? Probably not. But a well polished, tested, documented simple app may better reflect your developer skills, something that run of the mill web shops will also appreciate. Arguably a combination of both on Github wouldn't be a bad idea. 

&gt; I've decided to code up the system we use at work, minus the complexity. Currently trying to learn WCF and it's not easy to say the least but I'm getting there. I am well past needing to learn basic concepts like conditional statements, scope, loops, objects and I am (or I like to believe) I am pretty well versed in a fair amount of computer science still there are some topics that still need drilling, it's just putting it altogether now and making something with it, or learning some techs and libraries. Yet I always end up thinking no matter what, are they going to look at yet-another-basic-blog for an example ability to be a software developer?

Most places will use a combination of phone interviews and technical tests to gauge your skill level, just think of a blog/Github profile as something to help.

&gt; maybe I'm just being defeatist.

Why solar has a place...

* A lot of sites (especially in S England) have very limited wind resource but much more potential for solar. 
* Solar farms are more practical in scenic areas where wind farms are not allowed, such as AONB.
* The cost of PVs are dropping rapidly.
* Solar already contributes a [sizeable quantity of energy](http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/analysis/bright-future-the-growth-of-the-uk-solar-sector/1016277.article).

Old industries die, new ones emerge in their place. It's the natural order of things, and contrary to your fears, technology is still a long, long way off making work redundant. Unemployment rates were 4.7% in 2004, and following an influx of European migrant workers and a decade's worth of technological improvement, they're at 6.0% now, and getting *lower*. A hundred years before that, unemployment rates were exactly the same as they are now. While businesses appear to be hiring fewer staff than they used to, it appears that the balance is made in that there are far more businesses than there used to be. I can't see any data to suggest that there's any real unbalance between the jobs being eradicated and the jobs being created.

&gt; And the majority of design work for an app or car only needs to be done once.

That's ridiculous. Software, especially large, complex software that's dependent upon a huge amount of data, is never created and then just left. Not in a free or a competitive market.

Paragraph one (of yours) is where you say you think starting a conversation on homophobia is a funny joke.

Paragraph two is where you suggest that childish jokes aren't funny but gay jokes are.

Paragraph three is where you misuse the word smug and try to shift wrong doing on to me for representing myself and my community by asking you to not be so weird by over defending something that does not need to be defended. Smug means to be over proud of one's achievements. Being bi is awesome but isn't an achievement.

By internet nature this all comes off as hostile but as one member of the LGBTQ community I just want to prevent people from defending us as if we're a broken and helpless group.

true,awittyusername2014,null,null,"This is precisely why I support a land value tax. Specifically, the best housing policy would be a 100% tax on the annual rental value of unimproved value of land (ie. excluding the value of structures on it). This makes sense as a government funding mechanism because the value of a site is determined by public investment in things like infrastructure, schools, etc., rather than the efforts of the owner. Take Crossrail as an example. It's already increasing land values in areas close to stations, which means that land owners are receiving a benefit in the form of increased wealth due to taxpayer funded infrastructure. The government should be collecting that, as it's a return on its investment in infrastructure.  
  
A tax on land values would reduce the capital value of any site by the discounted value of future land tax payments. Since the tax I'm suggesting is leveled at 100%, the purchase price of a site would fall to the price of the structures on it. For areas like London, where land values are are a huge part of total cost of housing, this would bring about a huge reduction in the capital cost of buying a house. Of course, the flip side of that is that purchasers would have to pay an annual tax equal to the rental value of the land on which their house sits. Note that this would be powerful deterrent to land speculation and land banking because owners get no benefit from changes in land values. Generally, the effect of this policy would be to increase density in proportion to the value of land, so the most valuable land would also have the densest structures (effectively spreading the burden of paying the tax across more people).  
  
Land value taxes are also much more efficient than other taxes because the supply of land is fixed, so there is no deadweight loss (due to allocative inefficiency) caused by taxation. By contrast, taxing something like work (in the form of National Insurance and income tax) is less efficient because it causes people to reduce time spent working to some extent. The OECD already acknowledges property taxes as the most growth friendly taxes[1] and, if anything, they should be more harmful than pure land value taxes because they also tax improvements on land (ie. the value of the structures on them). So implementing a land value tax and then decreasing other taxes in a revenue neutral manner could have massive benefits for efficiency and growth.  
  
An admittedly basic policy analysis from a few years ago (read the whole thing; it's pretty interesting) estimated that a 100% land value tax would raise around £110 billion in revenue in England alone[2]. With that revenue we could afford to abolish National Insurance in its entirety!  
  
**tl;dr:** we should adopt a land value tax because it would reduce and stabilize house prices, encourage more efficient development (more density, less sprawl) and have secondary efficiency benefits if the revenues are used to reduce other taxes.

First off, I don't need your permission to point out that I thought a joke--that I perceived to be poking fun at the typical responses to posts like this--was funny. I don't need anyone's permission to defend any group. *That's* what's smug about you--your feeling that you get to speak for all of the LGBTQ community (sorry, that's the majority of people in that same community have chosen to use as a representative term). You're right, being bi isn't an achievement, which is exactly why you don't get to use being bi as a reason that you can decide who is ""defended."" Mind you, I put quotes around ""defend"" because I merely pointed out that I thought the initial joke (as I understood it) was funny, and was curious as to why it was downvoted.

Let me now state that the person who initially posted the joke has since said it was a cooties joke, which is as far from unfunny as you get. I would like to go on record that the joke doesn't deserve defense anymore, haha.

Do you honestly think my posts convey that ""[I] think starting a conversation on homophobia is funny?"" If so, I don't think I can change your opinion, as you're ascribing to my posts something radically different than what another person would see.

Next, I don't think people would classify a joke poking fun at the typical straight male response to this kind of post as a ""gay joke,"" but what the hell, you seem to not think about things much. For you, I guess any joke mentioning sexuality is a gay joke? I think the humor in the joke, as I saw it, was that it was a response from the perspective of a gay man to parody the typical response of the sub, which is overwhelmingly heterosexual and male. Again, I have said over and over now that I think I was reading too much into it.

In any case, as much as you aren't qualified to speak for an entire, vast community, I should care less about what you think. It just bothers me to be seen by some asshole on /r/liverpoolfc as supposedly a homophobe now. Oh well, I guess. I did my best to not give that vibe, I thought.

One thing that all users here seems to forget is Barcelona's willingness to sell, which is simply non-existent. Both wingers had fantastic seasons at Barca and are long term investments for the club. There is a very low likelihood that they would part with either winger for less than 50 m, and even then they would probably not sell. It's similar to the Lallana situation where the players mean a lot to the club and the club is very reluctant to sell, barring a transfer request from either player. Both Alexis and Pedro (while maybe somewhat unhappy at the rotation policy adopted by Barca), are still very happy playing at their ""dream club"" and are very unlikely to put in a request for a transfer as Lallana *supposedly* has. I think we'd have a better chance of signing Cristian Tello, who, with the emergence of Deulofeu will see his minutes probably decrease further. He still has so much potential and has scored a hat trick in his very limited playing time at Barcelona. We sign young players looking to improve their situation, and Alexis's and Pedro's situation is pretty much top notch at Barcelona.

""Leading assemblies in anti-Christian chants"" is one way to paraphrase it if you wanted to stir feelings up considerably and that is how the Daily Mail decided to report it.

It is worth digging out what David Hughes (the vice-chair of Park View Educational Trust) has to say about all this stuff. They are hopping mad at the way they have been portrayed:
&gt;David Hughes, the vice-chair of Park View Educational Trust, said: ""The speed and the ferocity with which Park View School, in particular, has been condemned, is truly shocking.""

&gt;OFSTED inspectors had come ""looking for extremism, looking for segregation, looking for proof that our children have religion forced upon them as part of an Islamic plot. The OFSTED reports find absolutely no evidence of this, because this is categorically not what is happening at our schools. Our schools do not tolerate or promote extremism of any kind.""

&gt;The problem was not extremism, he suggested, but ""the knee-jerk actions of some politicians"" who had ""put Muslim children from these communities at substantial risk of not being accepted as equal, legitimate and valued members of British society"".

true,earthlinkdilemma,null,null,"Same as /u/TheBlueOwlPlays here. I do remember him, he was fairly frequently in Greenfriars Park.

He was quite chatty, and gave me a similar story, too. About how he needed a specific amount of cash - £12.50 - to get into a council flat, which the council would eventually reimburse, but that he just didn't have right then, and he needed it by the end of the day. He also made sure to show me his arms to show there were no needle marks etc.

So I gave him the £12.50, and thought little more of it (except how shocking it was that the life of someone can depend on so little).

Anyway, a month or so later, I saw him again and this time he needed about £20 to get to an appointment, or something similar, and that he'd equally get it back. So I told him I'd loan him the money, but never saw it again.

The short of it, as far as I can tell? I got scammed. By someone who knows a fair amount of the tricks in the book - show you're not an addict, ask for a decent amount of money and make it sound urgent, and pull on the ""it could happen to you"" heartstrings.

And it makes me quite angry. Not because of the money I lost, but because, now, I'm not quite as trusting of beggars. And because there might be people genuinely in need of that £12.50 that I might not give it to, simply because I won't believe their story. Once bitten, twice shy.

So if I'm wrong, and if it turns out he was not operating a small-scale scam, I'd be very happy to find out. So thanks OP for posting this!",0,1402345541,null,0,false,0,ci39icr,t3_27nxui,t1_ci39icr,t3_27nxui,null,1434164913,2,false,coventry,t5_2qhtp,2

&gt;Is this a case of Birminghams immigrant heavy population being given control of several of their schools and basically deciding to teach what they wanted, which was perhaps a bit less... modern... than what we would expect. OR, was this is a case of extremists purposefully infiltrating schools with the sole intention of using them as recruiting grounds... and if so, recruiting grounds for what exactly?

The former, most likely. This talk of extremism is misleading, but I think the fear is the more indoctrinated into Islam the products of the school are the more susceptible they will be to influence by those who want to blow us up.

So far the slowest regular tram ride I was on was the free city circle tram in Melbourne. Those trams are somewhere between 60 and 90 years old and have a speed limit of 40kph.
The Edinburgh tram goes around corners like a grandma with a walker, then carefully accelerates just a tiny bit, but then the driver gets scared by the speed and immediately slows down again. Also on almost every stop the thing stands still for a minute or two, just for the fun of it.

Also: who was the idiot who came up with the idea of the ticket machines *not* giving change? No wonder those things fill up and stop working, no one is feeding it notes if you don't get change.

For instance TSB offer 5% interest from £1 to £2,000, if you put the maximum amount in, that is £100 before tax in a year.

Lloyds bank offer 4% for balances between £4,000 to £5,000 for the first year/1% after, which is not too bad, but if you have more/less than that, then it is not a suitable product and you have to be earning at least £23000 a year, pre tax.
