Everton will have a damn hard time equalling or bettering last year, especially if they lose Lukaku (not sure if they will or not yet though).

Liverpool hugely overperformed last year too, largely due to Suarez.  Rodgers' movements in the transfer market have often been pretty dodgy, so don't expect him to replace Suarez all that easily.  They have definitely stolen a march on us in transfers, but in losing Suarez, they lost not just a massive goal scorer, but a huge provider too.  Suddenly Sturridge and Sterling don't look so fearsome without Suarez running amuck.

I think it's fairly feasible we could finish above the two Merseyside clubs, though a tough ask.

Her story was amazing on how much she waited for the Doctor to return. She also had some crazy things happen to her like being stuck in a weird timey wimey spaceship for 37 years of her life and she became this beast that fights for survival. 2nd for me has to be Clara Oswald. I know a lot of people might hate me for putting that, but her story is amazing to me because she's the Impossible Girl. She jumped into the Doctor's timeline to save him from that one evil guy (forgot his name). She then comes back throughout the Doctor's lifetime to keep saving him and causing herself to die. It's very tragic, but very sweet. My number 1 is Rose Tyler because she was the first companion that I started out watching and it was Season 1 with Christopher Eccleston. I loved her because of how much she wanted to stay with the Doctor. No matter what, she wanted to be by his side. What made me love her even more was when the regeneration happened and he became David Tennant (My number 1 Doctor!), it, to me, felt like a love story between the Doctor and Rose. It was very cute and funny. The saddest part in all of Doctor Who is when David Tennant and Rose separated because of that void nonsense. It was a very touchy moment and I almost cried.

I've been using them every other day for about three weeks now. My skin feels smoother, it's a little less red and my SF has definutely reduced.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Honestly, all these signings have reached the point where we can't even brag. After Tottenham's summer last year there will be a great deal of skepticism about any team that brings in so many new faces. 

There's something to bringing in 3-4 guys that people can't really knock you for. It's stupid but true.

I'm not going to lie that all these signings don't worry me. How many signings under BR have been successful? Blame that on who you want but very few could be considered great successes. If his current success rate continues who amongst this new crop won't work out?

I guess Lambert and Remy will, price tags not considered, probably not be expected to change the club. Lallana may just be fortunate enough that even if he sputters here and there people (outside the club) won't notice because so many others were signed. Origi looks set to stay at Lille. Will he go the way of Aspas, Borini, Alberto, and others? I'm weary of signings like his. He could be a star or he could have had a few good world cup games. As for Lovren? Well I think CBs are largely graded unfairly. In world football we have 3 of the best CBs but somehow it's not working. I'm not sure how much that's their fault and not our setup. Although generally I think Lovren will be a hit and he can speak some French with Sahko. Then there's Marko. I can't say it's anything other than a gut feeling with him, but I don't think he's going to be a success and I think that's largely down to his mentality. I've not heard good things. Raw talent can only go so far, even with BR.


Understand I'm not shitting on us or saying we're pulling a Tottenham. Everyone is right to note we needed depth signings. At striker we've gotten those. We now have crazy depth on the wing. Are we a bit short of talent at CM? At fullback? Will Suarez's goals be too much to replace? Will Sturridge step up and will he stay healthy?

We go into this coming season with a lot of question marks. My only hope is that Brendan, rather than deferring to playing players we signed just because we signed them, plays those who earn their spots and who have a chemistry. 

I'm not basing this on Ibe's preseason displays, but it's clear Sturridge, Sterling, and he all have a bond off the field. Those often translate on the pitch and even though none are ""flashy"" signings I'd hope Rodgers lets our attack gel. I want to see Lallana in there and don't mean to suggest Ibe should be starting or even amongst the first 18. But I see that as an example where we might already have the talent and chemistry in our team to succeed available and we could stand to fuck it up by forcing random players in there.

There's a lot to look forward to and certainly this has been our most successful window in recent memory. I just hope time will prove that true as well.

EDIT: Lot's of negative feedback so perhaps I should add some clarity. I just posted on Teamtalk a point about how our signings were nothing like Tottenham's. Mostly proven PL quality. Largely from teams playing like our own. 

I think my greater point, lost in both the length and my poor explanation, was the fear that these signings could disrupt our established chemistry if there is a forced rapid integration. I just want BR to trust last year's squad in the places he really should. Yes, there will be rotation, but when we're lining up against Man Utd I think our front 6 need to include our last year front 6 just minus Suarez and plus whoever is in form. 

These lads are growing together and that is a VERY RARE thing in modern football. We reaped the rewards of it last season and I'd like to do so again.",0,1405927967,null,0,1405931934,0,cj38spv,t3_2b9zi0,t1_cj38spv,t3_2b9zi0,null,1434817855,-13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-13

In the last decade we've gone from being energy independent to having to import most of our energy [chart 3](http://fractionalflow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/fig-7-uk-trade-balance-and-estimates-for-energy-imports.png?w=630&amp;h=354), which is one of the major factors outside the financial crisis which is really hurting the economy.

You will also note that the first peak in oil production was when Thatcher was at the height of her power, and in my opinion is one of the major reasons that (at least outside the north) she is still seen as having a strong legacy, since that certainly helped to fuel the boom.

I'm of the opinions that, in general, politicians think and work on extremely short timescales of months to years (in a few rare cases decades at most).  However I think that much of their relative success or failure is caused by much longer timescale factors of which they're probably not cognisant, and over which they have at best minimal control.  I also think that the next general election is probably also an excellent one to lose, because whoever is in power 2015-2020 is probably going to end up with a fucking shitty legacy whatever they do.

And, in all honesty, I don't think blaming labour for doing what they did during a time of plenty is entirely fair.  I expect the conservatives would have enacted largely similar policies, which would have suffered just as much due to the financial crash.  It would be political suicide to enact policies expecting a crash during a boom period.  I mean Bush was in power in the states in the run up to 2008 and they hardly did any better.

I just think Rodger's gets a lot of credit for Sturridge and Coutinho when both were well regarded (if not by their own clubs) players prior to their transfers. So many fans say ""in Rodger's we trust"" about transfers and it's sort of maddening.

My hope is that the only changes in our first team on opening day are the additions of Lallana, Lovren, and our new LB. Let everyone else prove themselves over time, but Sterling and Coutinho should not be dropped to accommodate anyone else we've signed so far.

I just don't want Rodgers to fuck with the chemistry of our squad. Signings often do that because there is the assumption, even by management, that what is new is better.

He's actually a very good finisher, but just isn't built for the Premier League.

Sturridge, Coutinho, Mignolet, Sakho, Allen and Aspas were bought to be important members of the first team going forward. All but Aspas were very good signings. 5/6 successes.

Toure was brough in as a stop-gap measure and did a good job when called upon. 1/1 successes.

Ilori, Assaidi, Borini and Alberto were bought as youth prospect gambles. Of these, Ilori looks a great player in the making, Assaidi and Borini are BOTH being sold for a profit and Alberto hasn't played close to enough games to know if he'll make it. At a stretch, Alberto is the only one which could be said to have not worked out *yet*.

true,kopking08,null,null,"I don't think Remy will start personally. I think Lallana would slot in for Suarez and we'd sort of let Sturridge, Lallana, Coutinho, and Sterling all share the offensive and pressing load similar to last year. 

I can see Remy starting in certain matches alongside Sturridge, just as I can see Lambert, but I think our first 11 won't include either. Some might ask where do the goals come from then? I just think if we ask Lallana, Sterling, and Coutinho to pick up that load that they will be able to contribute quite a bit. Suarez scored 31 and assisted 13 in the PL. With Lallana's contribution we can bring that to 22 and 5 needed from other players. So let's assume Sterling and Coutinho each, with their new responsibility, score and assist a few more. We'd need 15 goals now and be plus 1 assist. There's also the probability that Sturridge will score a bit more. Maybe just add 3 for him. So 12 goals needed now. Well...

The difference, this year, compared to last, is that we will actually have goals available from our bench. Last year there was no game changer on the bench.

Perhaps you're a true neutral and that's why you can't work out if you're cool or warm? All Bobbi Brown foundations are neutral to yellow based as she has this philosophy that it's more flattering. I disagree with that as I'm neutral to pink toned but I can wear both of those shades just fine and I'm a ridiculously pale, freckly brunette. 

MAC NC15 is too dark for me but you might try a MAC counter too? Don't be afraid to tell them it's the wrong shade though as they keep trying to insist to me that an orange tidemark is normal....

Urban Decay Naked Skin in 0.5 or 1.0 may work and it's a gorgeous finish. Estee Lauder double wear in shell is also really pale, although the formula didn't work for my skin.

Or try YSL Touche Eclat foundation as that runs very pale in both warm and cool tones. I take a BR10 in this.

I wouldn't trust a machine or a counter assistant to match you. Ask for samples, take them away, see if they match you in sunlight as well as indoors, see if they oxidize on your skin and change colour over the course of the day.

Same goes for Borini. He was, while young, not signed ""for the future"". He was signed to play right away. Same as Sturridge and Coutinho were young but expected to play right away. Borini didn't seize his chance. He may be sold for a profit now, but no one can deny how shocked we are that it's happening. Sunderland are paying over the odds because he was their brightest light in a very dim season. Sunderland FREQUENTLY pay over the odds for players who end up being average for them. If Borini is bagging goals for a CL side someday I'll eat my hat, but that's what we signed him to end up doing. We're lucky Sunderland is buying him.

Same goes for Assaidi. Not really sure you can blame a 3.5 million signing on anyone though and I wouldn't really. 


I think most clubs have to look at signings as did the player become what we signed him to become. If you evaluate a player like Milner, bought for nearly 30 million pounds, on ""Oh he's been such a great squad player for us"" than sure players like Joe Allen are successes. If you evaluate Mignolet on ""Oh we don't need to immediately sign someone else"" than yes he's a success. Same goes for Sahko.

Frankly I think Mignolet is a success for his price. I just think some fans are daft to think he'll be around for years to come.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"So much negativity and undeserved caution in one post!

We brought in 7 new faces last year (the same as Spurs) and went from 7th to 2nd. The difference between us and Spurs is that we have a competent manager and they had two, well, not so competent managers, to put it nicely. No manager who plays a high line with Michael Dawson in the middle of defence deserves their coaching badges. Both of their managers lost heavily several times with inexplicable tactical decisions such as this and several other examples.

This summer we've both improved weaker areas of our first team (apart from fullbacks, admittedly) and increased depth and competition in other areas. That can **only** be a good thing.

&gt;Lallana may just be fortunate enough that even if he sputters here and there people (outside the club) won't notice because so many others were signed.

I can't believe you're already doubting Lallana when he hasn't even kicked a ball for us. I have to admit I almost stopped reading right there. What gives you any reason to doubt he will succeed here? He's one of the best English talents in his position in the whole league and he comes from a team that played a similar style to us last year, along with a teammate he linked up with practically every week for a goal.

&gt;Origi looks set to stay at Lille. Will he go the way of Aspas, Borini, Alberto, and others? **I'm weary of signings like his. He could be a star or he could have had a few good world cup games.**

He was being scouted well before the World Cup. Spurs were looking at him before us even, but we started looking at him before the start of the World Cup. He's one of the brightest talents in the French league. He's raw and will take time to become the finished product, but another year on loan and he could be a star when he comes back. He's had offers and interest from across Europe and yet he's chosen us. That's why this is different from last year. Last year we signed Aspas and Alberto when no one else was looking at them. I still hold some hope for Alberto. I liked what I saw in the few chances he got last season. He was only on the pitch for a few minutes against Spurs at the Lane but he made a beautiful assist for Suarez's second. I think he could still do a job here if he goes up another level while on loan this year.

&gt;Then there's Marko. I can't say it's anything other than a gut feeling with him, but I don't think he's going to be a success and I think that's largely down to his mentality

Oh ffs. He's been touted as one of the top 3 talents in the whole of Europe for players under the age of 21. He ran rings around Spurs in both EL games last year and he put in impressive performances every time I watched Benfica last year (about 10 altogether). Numerous scouts are saying he's an absolute diamond. For some reason, you just have some negativity in your head. Sorry, it's entirely misplaced.

&gt;Understand I'm not shitting on us

Well then what is it?

&gt;Will Suarez's goals be too much to replace?

We don't necessarily need to. We could score 80 goals next season and still win the league if we have some better defenders...like Lovren and someone to replace Johnson.

&gt;But I see that as an example where we might already have the talent and chemistry in our team to succeed available and we could stand to fuck it up by forcing random players in there.

Ibe is not ready yet. He's almost there, but not yet. Getting Lallana was a stroke of genius. Ibe is perfectly suited to play in the cups or go out on loan till Christmas and we just see how he does. But he's only played against the likes of Preston and Brondby....neither of which are the likes of City or Spurs, who we play early in the season. Don't forget, Sturridge, Sterling and Lallana all went to the World Cup together, so they probably bonded there too. They all must've known Lallana was about to join as he was at Melwood within hours of the team arriving back in England. There's not a chance in hell I'd choose to play an 18 year old who's only ever played one meaningless Premier League match at the end of the season before last (Carra's last game) over a 26 year old who had the season of his life last year.

Sorry for ranting but the negativity and 'what ifs' in this post drove me up the fucking wall. There haven't been any causes for concern so far this summer. We got a brilliant deal for Suarez and we're financially stronger now than we have *ever* been. Targets are choosing **us**  now and from the sounds of it, half of them are pleading to be allowed to come and join us.

Conversely, my biggest fear regarding Jews is that they will eventually leave Europe, so sick they've become of the antisemitism here.  Is there any group who have contributed more to mankind?   Yes, orthodox Judaism is dumb and even harmful, but it's nowhere near as dangerous as what we've seen come from Islam.

Prejudice against individual Muslims is wrong, but by far the biggest reason the prejudice exists is because of how the Muslim world has behaved.  If any group of people behaved like followers of Islam they would be similarly treated with suspicion, fear and loathing.

I do draw the line at full face veils. It is a security issue. Not a religious issue. In the West you don't cover your face in public. Just don't do it. It's disrespectful. You want tolerance?

true,tesseract_rider,UnionFlag,Oxford - 2006 Triumph Speed Four,"I had a very similar off last November. The car involved was a potentially uninsured taxi, so I'm still waiting for resolution, but here's a couple of things I've learned:

1. Call 101 and get a Police reference number. Chase them to make sure they're following up. The car's left the scene of an accident and even without a collision, if they caused it (and you've got witnesses) the police will be very useful in dealing with the insurers.
2. You should be able to claim. It may be worth using your comprehensive cover (if you've got it) to get the repairs done and then get your insurers to chase the third party. Once the third party insurer's paid up, you should get your excess and no-claims back. Once your insurer's paid for repairs, they will also probably be more motivated to deal with things quickly. I waited &gt;6mo to get my bike back before doing this.  
3. Write everything down. I've got a long evernote note with all the details. 
4. Be proactive - call everybody (police, insurers, etc.) daily if you have to.
5. Be proactive - I mean it. Ask for direct numbers to file handlers, find out who the third party insurer is and call them too. Record the name of everyone you speak to. 
6. Be friendly. I was on first name terms with most of the people in the various offices by the time my bike got fixed, and they were going out of their way to help. The system may be designed to screw you, but the people on the phone probably aren't. 
7. This will be a hassle. 
8. There's a good chance that the cost of repairs will be enough for them to want to write off the bike, even if the damage seems superficial. They won't offer you enough to replace your bike exactly. They may, however, be willing to do repairs up to the settlement figure so you can get your bike back. I got a bunch of stuff repaired, including repainting and dealing with the engine casings, but chose to not get the scuffed exhaust fixed, which kept the cost below the write off threshold.

There are a couple of other benefits to a WM (e.g. time, peace of mind and personal connections as Kentyfish points out) which are not necessarily very well known which was one of the reasons I was posting this. I like Nutmeg (I use it myself) which is basically a stripped-down version of a wealth management service and doesn't offer many of the more ""intangible"" benefits. I was thinking of adding some thoughts about this, but the post is already very long! Just to note also, Nutmeg is quite cheap for what it offers IMO, but once you are at the £500k mark many of the WMs become extremely competitive. Lastly, although a minority of WM clients are financially illiterate, generally they have at least some knowledge and some are extremely financially savvy. I have met more than one M&amp;A guy (mergers &amp; acquisitions, investment banking) who use WMs because they don't have time to manage their own investments!

On the FMs, I was really talking about those managing large retail funds (most relevant to this sub); regarding private equity and hedge funds, it is actually extremely difficult for retail investors to gain access to these opportunities (you usually have to be classified as a ""professional investor""). A WM may be able to help if you want this access...

Vorm for £5 seems about right, but you'd be very optimistic to think Davies is worth £8M. £5-6 is probably more correct for a back of his magnitude.

All I can see at the moment is racism, racism, and more anti-Russian racism. Without a clear explanation as to why.

Every tragedy is composed of multiple things going wrong. You never get a tragedy from just a single negative reason. There must be several all contributing to the event. In this case:

* possible handling of powerful weapons by untrained individuals
* instability in a region resulting from political policies denigrating a specific ethnicity
* instability in a region resulting from Europe's unwillingness to assist financially caused by financial instability within Europe itself
* air traffic control in Ukraine being far more optimistic than guidance provided by America to American airlines (inconsistent air traffic control policies worldwide)
* commercial aviation companies choosing risky paths to keep airfares low
* consumers purchasing the cheapest available ticket for long haul travel (Malaysian Airlines were known for providing cheaper fares than some other well known international carriers)

Yes - there is anger that surface-air missiles exist - that Russia built such technology - and that Ukraine and Russia has had access to these weapons for some time. Indeed there is justified anger that deaths have occurred - particularly to citizens who should otherwise be uninvolved with a localised conflict.

We're still seeking to provide evidence that any party had the intention of bringing down a civilian aircraft.

The issue is most people are not like these persons, the vast majority here on reddit are not criminals or likely to ever contemplate any sort of these crimes or behaviours, however they ARE likely to have read stories and seen videos of the police abusing their power. 

Without wanting to sound patronising, for a lot of people it's just not something within their sphere of experience, the only reason they can contemplate police wanting to knock on people's door is to get authority hardons, rather than actually doing their job and trying to deal with these known-but-unproved criminals.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying 'oh well sorry to those people who *were* raped and nothing happened to their abusers, but 0.1% of people are innocent so we need to focus on that instead'.

If 'majority of rape goes unpunished' (an almost impossible-to-prove claim - not saying it doesn't happen, just saying it's nearly impossible to prove), there needs to be a stronger support network for victims as perhaps a priority. I remember a story on here about a gay man who was drugged and raped for a weekend by a man he went to meet, and he chose *not* to press charges against the man.

Now, I cannot possibly fathom how devastating and destructive that experience must have been for the man, but it is *his* responsibility to report that criminal to make sure it doesn't happen again. You can go to the doctors, have them test you for drugs that you were drugged with, check you medically, and work in conjunction with the police to provide the evidence needed to convict the criminal.

I'm not sure what the answer is. If someone is accused of rape without evidence multiple times by multiple people, of course the police are going to be 'keeping their eye on you' - that's not anything new and anyone who reads the article will see that. It's not particularly revolutionary and I don't think this article or this introduction of 'issuing warnings' is going to change anything, other than *maybe* convincing some serial rapists who haven't been convicted to stop raping people.

You said 'the police did fuck all' when your friend was raped, but really I suspect they did all they *could* do - including 'keeping an eye on the person suspected'. It's the same as any crime. If there's irrefutable evidence, then convict and convict away. If the evidence is sketchy and vague and there's not really any way to prove beyond any doubt that the person you are looking to convict is guilty, then how can you possibly convict them? Imagine if you were walking along the street and you were arrested and taken to a lineup where a woman stood behind the glass says, 'That's the one!' and you're locked away for 12 years and placed on a sex offenders register for a crime you didn't commit, all because everyone felt too bad about people being raped to ever question the victim. Obvious hyperbole, but the point still stands.

Rape is like any other crime and should be treated as such. You just cannot go around convicting people on suspicion. I do not want to live in that country.

I just feel that an injection of real quality is needed now. Somebody to excite the fans and lift the whole club.

“Can you expect anything better than Real Madrid, the greatest and most demanding club? It was the right moment to seize the opportunity.

I'd have thought it's a rather obvious joke.  Posh white guy with blond hair is squatting amongst a group of black children around a primitive looking campfire.  Evokes images of colonials among the natives.  Plays just as much off the stereotype of upper class toffs as anything else.

2012/13: 

What the season will be remembered for: The David Moyes sideshow. He spent the entire season stalling on signing a new contract and eventually ended up at Manchester United. 

First game of the season vs Man Utd at Goodison. 20/08/12

Away at Swansea - 22/09/12. 

Both available on evertontv.

2011/12: 

What the season will be remembered for: Jelavic. Jesus, the guy was incredible when he first arrived. I won't put it as a game to watch, but it's well worth watching his goal at Goodison vs Tottenham. I think it was his first Everton goal.

2009/10:

What the season will be remembered for: The Joleon Lescott transfer saga. Basically, a few days before the transfer deadline, Lescott publicly (but not officially) said he wanted to move to Man City. Man City had put in a bid for him that had been rejected. Protocol is that if a bid is rejected, the club can come back with a higher bid or the player can put in a transfer request, making it known that he no longer wishes to play for the club. However, the player is still contractually obliged to play - and the club does not have to sell. After the bid became public knowledge and Lescott made his wishes known to the press, it was Everton v Arsenal at Goodison Park - the worst defeat I've ever seen at Goodison in my life, and (I believe) our worst defeat at home in the Premier League. We lost 6-1, with Lescott at fault for almost every goal. He refused to play; and we had very little cover for his position at centre back. It was his last game for EFC - we sold him for £22m shortly after. Since then, we've not really got on with Man City, and it was at this time that David Moyes came out with a lot of his soundbites that were reused to show his hypocrisy over Baines and Fellaini. For instance - ""Everton do not sell cheap"". 

Away vs Chelsea. 12/12/09. 

Home vs Man City. 16/01/10. (First game vs City since the Lescott saga).

---

&gt;

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) which ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__. 

&gt;Betteridge explained the concept in a February 2009 article, regarding a [TechCrunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch) article with the headline ""Did Last.fm Just Hand Over User Listening Data To the RIAA?"":

&gt;&gt;This story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word ""no"". The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably [bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit), and don’t actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.

true,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"It doesn't surprise me, unfortunately. I don't think it's all deliberate ripping off, either. The IT support industry is flooded with people who learned their craft on internet forums, where you'll generally have one person explain a problem, and have twenty teenagers (generally with usernames like Whizzkid69, or CorsairDominatorXXX) suggest twenty different fixes, 19 of which won't fix the problem, and none of which have any diagnostic logic behind them. These are the people who go on, without any formal qualifications at all, to work freelance IT support, or for small repair shops with no training process of their own. And that's where these problems come from, it seems.

My favourite face-palm moment about that sort of thing happened only a few months ago. I was round at a guy's house, and he had a PC that wouldn't start up. I asked him what was wrong with it, he said he'd had Local Dr. PC Fix It round, but he couldn't figure it out at all, and was coming back later that day. The side was off the case and out of curiosity I had a look inside, and I was confused to see a two-wire cable with the end severed, and the insulation stripped. I asked what it was for.

""Oh, Local Dr. PC Fix It did that. It's the lead to the power button. He was trying to hotwire it.""

And then it got depressing, it's the only piece I've seen discussing FFP as a reason why we are not being bought. It's a very good reason. Because other than the squad we don't need investment. The stadium is fine, the training ground is relatively new. Villa's entertainment venues (Holte Hotel, Holte Suite) are up to date. In fact even the Aston Tavern is being renovated.

The only thing that needs doing is the squad. We won't get much sponsorship money until we become successful, the fans wouldn't stand for selling the naming rights to Villa Park or Bodymoor Heath.

His point is: the road to the Champions League and prolonged success is very long. And then once the Champions League is insight, the clubs already there or the ones with more money will buy your players.

&gt; We fought war against Germany and Japan. Shit, we even used nuclear weapons in Japan twice. Now they are trusted allies.

The difference between the middle east and japan is that we (the west) installed a pro western government with democracy to an &gt;ALREADY UNITED PEOPLE&lt; in japan, this is the important bit.

In the middle east what we did was carve up massive swathes of land (previously owned by the ottoman empire) that had multiple ethnicities and religious sects, WHO HATED EACH OTHER and FORCED them to live and work in the same country as each other. THEN we put the minority ethnicities in charge, so that they depended upon us for support to stay in charge. This allowed us to get oil in exchange for weapons and money.

&gt; Yet the Middle East is still a shit hole. Of course time lessens things. The Middle East has had ample time to get their shit together.

Lets walk through the different countries shall we because this rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than ""its a shit hole"", and i was hoping you would do some research yourself but that clearly hasnt happened.
(this is a quick summary of the events that i believe are important)

**Iran** (sect: Shia)

In 1906 Iran was a very liberal country, peaceful and stable. Various religious sects lived and worked closely with each other on a daily basis. Iran was a constitutional monarchy, like the UK, and was generally a nice place to live.

In 1953, the UK and US overthrew the government and installed the shah, a harsh ruler who increasingly became oppressive, brutal, corrupt, and extravagant. Using secret police to root out dissent, opposition groups where driven underground, mainly to religious places as they where the only safe havens, which culminated in the secular Iran we see today.

Growing dissent against interference from the west (death to america etc.) and the horrible things that America and the west was not only allowing but actually supported and gave assistance to the Shah. This ended in the Iranian Revolution. A secular religious government was formed under the grand ayatollah. Whose fault is it that Iran is so secular? ours.

**Saudi Arabia** (sect: sunni)

The west gives these repressive rulers money and weapons for oil, essentially keeping them in power but denouncing other dictators/absolute monarchs. They use, essentially slave labour from India but do western media outlets report this? No, because they know its our fault that they continue to do this shit. Whose fault is it that these guys are still in power? ours.

**Israel**

Jews started moving to and around what is now isreal today whilst the ottoman empire was still alive and well. They bought land and built houses on it all legaly. This movement is known as the zionist movement (zion is their home according to religious scripts) and was all legal under the ottoman empire. After world war 2 and the holocaust there was massive influx of Jews to what is today Israel because other countries just didnt want them in their countries. So Israeli jews made a clandestine movement known as the Aliyah Bet (The british banned immigration to Israel because of secular riots that where going on).

After this the British essentially gave up and said they couldnt find a solution that was acceptable to both Arabs and Jews (now accounting for 33% of the population). The UN proposed ""an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem ... the last to be under an International Trusteeship System"". As Jerusalem is important to both religions. The Jewish league accepted this but Arabs did not.

On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared ""the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel"". The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been British Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

After a ceasefire isreal lost gaza strip and the west bank and east jerusalem. Since then there has been fighting between Isreal and various Arab states with Israel gaining land. As Israel gets a huge amount of money and support from America and Britain, it has a very capable army and continues to repress the Palestinians who lived/live in Israel.

**Gaza strip**

There is also a lot to the Gaza strip, America tried to interfere there and get a pro western government installed but Hamas, with funding from Iran managed to suppress this.

**Iraq**

You probably know this one, weapons of mass destruction, turns out there arent any and we just want Iraqs oil. We install a ""democratic"" government who refuse to work with the other religious sects in the country. Currently its a breeding ground for radicalisation and extremism.

&gt; We should develop alternate energy sources.

Wow arent you the intellectual. The EU is legally obligated to source ~30% of its energy from renewables by 2020 so we are already doing that.

&gt;  Then we don't need the Middle East at all and they can all die for all I care.

What are you 12? The reason this planet is so shit is because of apathetic morons like you :)

I'm not throwing our protections in the bin for the sake of making it easier for MI5 to spy on some harmless environmental activists or disabled rights advocates, which is what they really mean when they say ""domestic extremist"". Limitless, constant, unobstructed monitoring of all UK communications by the state as a matter of routine and the abandonment of human rights? No - nothing is worth that.  

&gt; We demand to be kept safe, and we are, and we are still one of the free-est nations on the planet. 

Define ""free-est"". If we're talking about how democratic we are then we're not even close to ""free-est"", if we're talking about the ability of individuals to make alternative lifestyle choices and live openly then we're doing pretty damn well. 

My grandfathers fought in WW2 and the EHCR is an important bulwark against the fascism they fought against - frankly I'm disgusted that anyone would want rid of the EHCR and it's an astonishing betrayal of principles for someone to be in favour of the Tories' plans while somehow considering themselves a patriot.

Yeah, he's a flop. Not considering the money, he's been mediocre at best. Considering the money, he's been a flop.

But we shouldn't hate him for it. I've seen a lot of people who seem to literally hate Fernando Torres. It's almost like they think he's choosing to play poorly.

Has anyone ever played golf? I don't really play much, but I know enough about golf to know that sometimes players get the yips. They just can't do well. There's some kind of mental block that keeps them from succeeding.

Fernando Torres has the yips, people. He's not purposely doing bad because he's a spy sent by Liverpool to ruin Chelsea. If he had the choice, he would score many goals every game and Chelsea would win every single game. But that isn't the case. It's a very, very, very hard sport to play. Especially when millions of people are watching and, in the case of playing at a big club, millions of people are waiting for you to fail, and they'll pounce if you do.

I'm not trying to say that he's not a flop. Any way you slice it he's been a flop. But I don't see why we need to paint him as this evil figure.

Also: I'm not trying to dictate peoples opinions. You are allowed to think anything you want to think. If you think that Torres has done great, I think you're wrong, but that's okay. If you think that you need to hate Torres and do terrible things to a voodoo doll of his, I think that's extreme and a little weird, but that's okay. Everyone has opinions. If we get worked up about every opinion we disagree with, we'll be miserable people. Don't sweat the small stuff.

...

**TL;DR**: Torres is a flop. He has the yips. We shouldn't hate him. That's my opinion, and all of you are totally entitled to your own.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"The best thing to do is to consider the *worst case scenario*. The worst case scenario of a rental gone bad is... well you have a shitty experience for a few months and then you move out at the end of your initial 6 month term. The worst case scenario of home ownership is that you need to move, can't find a buyer and when you finally do you lose tens of thousands because you bought a lemon of a property, or you can't move at all -- and don't bank on the viability of becoming a landlord, consent to let is not guaranteed and it's not profitable over the short term.

Yes, when renting you're paying another persons mortgage, but you're also paying for a roof over your head and taking no long term risk. Buying because you don't want to pay another persons mortgage is a bad strategy, it can be a *consideration* (eg: I want to buy this property *because* ... *and* I will be building equity instead of paying rent) but as a primary motivator it's not good. Property ownership makes sense if you expect to live in the same place for *at least* 5 years, anything less and it's rarely a good idea (The current crazy price increases in London aside...).

&gt; No matter the dickish nature of the agent, my instinct is to rent for 6 months, take the hit and then buy a place if we really like it in the city.

Don't try to come in under a spousal visa. Right now, you won't have enough to really stand up, and if it's rejected, the process gets even more annoying and complicated the next time you try.

You want to go to university in the UK?  That's better.  That's fantastic, even.  Find the one you want to go to, and apply. Get accepted. The university helps you with the visa process, and you come in under a student visa.  

The tuition fees might be ridiculous, but if you were already planning to go to a bigger US college, it's about the same.  And with public transportation being pretty awesome in this country, you don't have to be in the same town as the boyfriend, because you can be almost anywhere and still be within a day's distance from him.

You come in, you have your student visa, you keep your nose clean (this means no under the table jobs, making sure all your details are updated regularly, etc. - the international student office at the university will totally help you on this).  And if it works out between you and your boyfriend (and I'm not automatically saying it won't), you can apply for your spousal visa.  

The fact that you're already in the country will help, and since you will be applying well before your student visa runs out (and *please* don't let your student visa run out, because then you can kiss this entire process goodbye), there's more of a chance it'll all work out and you'll be a contributing member of this society.

Do you think your logic hasn't been applied to existing support as well? Prioritizing female victims ""because there's more of them"" is a pretty pervasive line of thought that shows itself whenever funding for rape/domestic violence services comes up.

Just one problem: Gender neutral services spend more time/money on female victims naturally. If women are 80% of victims then they'll be 80% of referrals. There's no need to further ""prioritize"" female victims beyond that, unless you want 80% of victims to get 90% of the time/money spent on them, which sounds to me like it would very much affect the support available for males.",0,1405943007,null,0,false,0,cj3bt7z,t3_2b8iww,t1_cj3bt7z,t1_cj38rne,null,1434819377,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In any case. The real benefit of the London to Birmingham section of HS2 is capacity. South of Rugby the WCML is basically at capacity or will be before this section is complete anyway. You can't just add extra capacity to a rail way line cheaply and without disruption and you certainly can't do it on Europe's busiest railway line. A new line is a necessity. When you're building a new line, it's only a small extra price to build it to standards capable of supporting high speed trains. That advantage of that, for the UK, is that as the new line extends North the train begins to compete with planes on Anglo-Scottish routes and that is a huge market. Speed, speed, speed, is the only basis on which the later parts of the network make economic sense.

I agree with you, and I would personally never seek to vote for someone on the basis of charisma.

Perhaps 'charisma' was the wrong word to use here, and it would have been more accurate for me to use the word 'passionate'.

True, but not really relevant.

&gt; This is an ideological move by the conservatives. A move that removes control of an essential social programme for us all and put's it in control of profiteers who are only looking out for themselves.

You seem to be confusing ""sale of existing loans"" with ""privatising control of the loans system"". Nobody is proposing the latter.

The loans system is designed to make university funding look cheap, for now. By making the funding ""loans"" that, in theory have to be repaid, they can give money to students without it actually affecting their current balance sheet. Of course, this is completely unsustainable. In 10 years time, when we realise that only a tiny fraction of these loans will ever be repaid, we've got a higher education funding crisis. The government is betting that the economy will be in a substantially better position by then and will be able to absorb the billions of pounds it will cost to sort out.

Which politician won't do this? Cameron was elected on a very different basis than what he has actually implemented in parliament.

Cameron was the hug a hoody, all in this together, candidate. In government the convictions of his party have been demonstrably different.

As much as I'm unsure of Miliband, Cameron is far worse. At least Miliband has unambiguously stated he is perfectly content with the EU as it is. Cameron I don't know if he is closer to Blair or Farage on this issue. He seems to be all things to all men. He is simultaneously the man who says no to everything in the EU and a pro-European who wants to desperately campaign on an in vote in 201X.

In many ways Cameron is worse than Blair was. Blair was a liar but at least he was consistent in government. You knew what Blair was going to do even if you didn't agree with it. I can't say this about Cameron. The other thing about Blair was he took ownership of the whole mess. There was a ""buck stops with him"" mentality where he personally took on the burden of sanitising every unpopular decision Labour made (and sadly did a very good job of it for a long time). Cameron seems to have the more traditional delegate to somebody who can be fired and take the blame model.

Funnily enough I also wrote to him about DRIP and I am yet to receive a reply. Often he takes quite a long time to reply when I've written previously and normally he just sends what seems to be standard Conservative party replies and copy pasted data and fails to address any of my specific points.

Personally I don't have much hope or faith in the political system and I am by no means right wing but I don't let it stop me from at least trying to raise my concerns and I understand that there are countries far worse off in terms of representation. As a keen reader of New Internationalist I often find myself writing about various issues raised in that particular publication.

I don't agree with him at all from what I've seen on many issues but feel it is somewhat my duty to try to contribute my point of view anyway and try to get it across in a way that enables him to broaden his perspective.

As an unemployed individual with disabled friends I really don't understand what all the fuss about reducing welfare spending is about especially when it hits the most vulnerable such as the disabled and the ill who are not at fault for their problems and should not, in my opinion, suffer a lower standard of living just because they are unable to work or because many employers fail to accommodate them (even if they are declared 'fit for work'). It seems to me that even welfare fraud is relatively minimal in affect on the finances of the country in comparison to large scale tax avoidance, etc. I guess it can be harder to chase those though as they normally can afford world class legal teams that can stall investigations for years or months at a time...

You cannot ruin someone's life by accusing them of rape, you can ruin someone's life if you provide EVIDENCE that they raped you. But I think that's fair enough.

It IS innocent until proven guilty, what is being proposed is not retribution without just cause, it is simply recognition that rape is difficult to prove.

Fair point, but I suppose what I was driving at is that most of them manage to hide it quite well. Both Blair and Cameron managed to make it look like they had real principles (and to be fair, I think they genuinely did) - Miliband has never seemed like he's standing for anything but office.

I actually quite liked Blair domestically, as it happens, at least until around 2002, but you're spot on about Cameron. I don't fear an ideologue as much as I fear an incompetent, and Cameron's got a smattering of both. I don't think his government knows what they're doing, but it's not stopping them from driving ahead anyway. Saying that, a choice between him and another Blairite government is no choice at all. Eugh.

I think Miliband is probably a stand up guy, and obviously very intelligent. He lacks the charisma and conviction to lead however, and I think you can judge him before he's in power: he seems incapable of stamping his authority on his own party, of tackling a government so weak that a stiff breeze would blow half the Cabinet over and every PMQs he's just floundering. 

I wish he were better, I really do, but he's the wrong person for the job. No idea who'd be better, unfortunately.

This does not exist in isolation. There are other factors at play.  Profiteers are relevant. The overall ideological agenda is relevant. The real issue that they are trying to address is relevant.... But it isn't mentioned... really, it's a mere sidenote.

About 40% at best, pay back their student loan. THAT is the problem. People not getting paid enough... is the root issue. It needs addressed. The minimum wage is far too low. Passing the buck to profiteering middlemen is not a solution, it's a temporary fudge of the books. Plug that hole and another one will appear. (people not getting paid enough remains)

Context matters.

I actually agree with the government's move.. **IF** it existed in isolation. Selling debt to remove liability is a sound investment. But it doesn't address the problem of people not getting paid enough to pay back their student debt. A minimum wage of £10ph would greatly improve the payback rate.

You are right, the police did all that they were supposed to do, took statements etc, I just got very annoyed because from their line of questioning I could tell that they had made their minds up already and weren't pursuing the matter seriously or even with the intent to find out the truth. It seemed like they just wanted the matter wrapped up and written off so that they didn't have to deal with it.

I understand your fear but I don't think you realise that that isn't how it works. Police will generally not prosecute rape unless the victim has gone to a hospital for a rape test.

true,eton_linguist,null,null,"&gt; are you from a wealthy family

Not wealthy as in landowning but I cannot pretend we're poor. I certainly wouldn't have been able to go to Eton without a scholarship. Many boys there are in the same situation. The scholarship provision is excellent and getting better.

The school was actually set up to provide a free education for scholars. When the wealthy saw how good it was they would pay for their sons to lodge in the town and join in lessons. That's the origin of the house system.

&gt; how did your family acquire whatever wealth it had

My father's a professional.

&gt; are you now wealthy yourself

Not at all. Eton has a really good record of producing boys who go into all sorts of different fields, not just the city and politics (even if there are some big names there, too). Around the time I left, one boy went off to become a dancer, another a magician, many became musicians and artists and so on.

So I think there is a certain pressure to be successful but not in financial terms. I'm gradually working my way into academia where there is no money at all.

&gt; is education at Eton any good in your opinion

I think it was really excellent; at least, I feel hugely lucky to have been able to go there. On the one hand it's very traditional. It's a system which has been tried and tested for nearly 600 years.

On the other hand the school is actually very progressive in ways people may not know. It was one of the first public schools to abolish corporal punishment, for example, long before it was made illegal. It was early to start teaching Chinese and a few years ago they were the first school to employ an imam. Because the school can select by academic ability and attract top teachers the day-to-day classroom style is fairly forward-looking, too.

One of the most important things is that many of the teachers have had other careers first. Among my teachers there were ex-soldiers and bankers and actors and salesmen and academics, and their wealth of experience really counted for a lot.

&gt; is bullying prevalent at Eton

If you were a dick people let you know. But it was a fairly sane place.

&gt; have connections made at school made any difference in your life

I can't really see it in terms of connections as I might see professional networking now. I did make some very good friends but they will always be friends first. I would feel awkward taking advantage of them. Eton has opened many doors to me, particularly abroad.

Those who do well with their degree will pay off all of their loans in a relatively short period of time, those who do okay will pay off all/most of their loans in a relatively long period of time, those who do poorly will pay off some fraction of their loans over their lifetime.

Presumably the government has some figure in mind for what percentage of their loans they can expect to write-off (even if it's quite significantly different from the actual value), meaning they'll have built *some* overhead into the loan which is covered by those who can afford it.

Even then, the money lost is more than covered by the fact that they then have an educated generation rather than an uneducated one, keeping the UK's education standard relatively high. It's been seen that the increase in tuition loans hasn't had a massive effect on applicants to universities, and the new model (i.e. higher payback threshold but higher loans) seems relatively sensible in terms of making it affordable to the majority (as you say, many people may not be able to cover the whole cost even over their lifetime, but those who do will will cough up more money in the long run which may offset that somewhat).",0,1405947332,null,0,false,0,cj3cyi5,t3_2ba1oo,t1_cj3cyi5,t1_cj3bw48,null,1434819952,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Graduate pay in the UK is comparable with the rest of the Western world and above average.

A graduate who is receiving minimum wage isn't repaying their loan, _by design_. The minimum repayment threshold _has to be higher than minimum wage_ for the system to work.

Therefore, this:

Just as England and Wales would be right in the Roman description, but more modern use of Britain as an alternate for the UK is more common. Also 'Britain' is not the same as 'Britannia', which as you point out is the Roman term for 'Roman Britain', ie England and Wales.

We're arguing semantics here really, but I think the point is that when someone refers to Britain, they might be referring to the UK and not necessarily just GB.

The arrival of James may have, time will tell, a direct victim. All eyes rest on the Malaga Isco, whose future, for now, through the Real Madrid. Neither the club want to get rid of him or the player provides an outlet despite the signing of the Colombian and the likely difficulty will generate when minutes count and prominence. 

For parts, the first affected, the Golden Boy 2012 is very happy at Real Madrid and feels that the club remains confident in him, regardless of hiring James. The costasoleño arrived a year ago to the White House after discarding the juicy offer from Manchester City. Only 12 months later did not think your choice was wrong, hence has no reason for a change. He is European champion, is 22 years old and last year played 53 games, starting 35, with 11 goals. 

With regard to the club, not a sale of one of the greatest talents of the staff and one of the most ilusionó transfer to Real Madrid last year, both for his football and his youth, besides the fact that it is now raised Spanish. 

The situation today is that, but events can go in another direction. Because there are many teams that are going to knock on the door of the Real Madrid player to try and convince a handover. 

Liverpool has already moved about. But it is not and will not be the only one. The will be more powerful and perhaps more attractive to the player, which has a big market, like last summer was already demonstrated. 

Until the close of trading ... 

Isco could take the first three weeks of competition -Supercopa Europe, Spain and two days Liga- as a test as to his chances of playing. If you see that will very difficult to enter Ancelotti plans, maybe change my mind. Much remains to close the market exit of midfielder permanently. 

Furthermore, the type of game Isco not easily accommodated in the design of Ancelotti, delivered for months to 4-3-3. The Italian drew the possibility of making a flyer inspired Isco Seedorf and his matches against Barca in the Cup final against Bayern and the Bernabéu showed that Carletto was not far wrong.

true,LimitlessLTD,eng-Surrey,Surreeh,"&gt; The statistics show that women are pretty powerless when it comes to rape, most rapes go unreported because the allegations AREN'T taken seriously a lot of the time.

The problem is that this is just plain sexist. Regardless of the statistics you think you can source it is literally blaming all men for the actions of a few. It doesnt solve the problem but instead creates more inequality.

Black people make up a majority of criminal convicts in US prisons, does that mean that clearly the US should issue warnings to black people just for being black and they suspect they commited a crime? Do you see the absurdity that you are advocating?

&gt; You cannot ruin someone's life by accusing them of rape, you can ruin someone's life if you provide EVIDENCE that they raped you. But I think that's fair enough.

Actually you can, and it happens quite often in universities and colleges. All that needs to happen is woman needs to accuse man of rape, woman tells media outlet. Done. The accused is forever marked. Thanks to the pervasiveness of the internet.

&gt; It IS innocent until proven guilty, what is being proposed is not retribution without just cause, it is simply recognition that rape is difficult to prove.

Yes rape is difficult to prove, but implementing sexist policies isnt the way to solve it.

&gt; If I get accused of rape and I am innocent and the police want to come round and tell me that rape is wrong and warn me of the consequences that is fine. No biggie, I can hold my head high and simply agree with them.

Im sure it will be fine, until you lose your job because a co-worker accused you of rape. Your family dis-owns you because you ""raped"" someone, your friends find out that you ""raped"" someone through social media and isolate you.

It should always be innocent until proven guilty. Issuing of warnings for supposed crimes specifically targeted against 1 sex is absolutely not the right thing to do.

&gt;

&gt;__Circulatory shock__, commonly known simply as __shock__, is a life-threatening [medical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical) condition that occurs due to inadequate [substrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry\)) for [aerobic cellular respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration#Aerobic_respiration).  In the early stages this is generally an inadequate tissue level of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen). 

&gt;The typical signs of [shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock) are [low blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension), a [rapid heartbeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia) and signs of poor end-organ [perfusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion) or ""decompensation/peripheral shut down"" (such as low urine output, confusion or loss of consciousness). There are times that a person's blood pressure may remain stable, but may still be in circulatory shock, so it is not always a sign. 

&gt;Circulatory shock is not related to the [emotional state of shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(psychological\)). Circulatory shock is a life-threatening [medical emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency) and one of the most common causes of death for critically ill people. Shock can have a variety of effects, all with similar outcomes, but all relate to a problem with the body's circulatory system. For example, shock may lead to [hypoxemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia) (a lack of oxygen in arterial blood) or [cardiac arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest).

Let's work a practical example. Say you buy a £250,000 place with a 20% deposit (£50,000). You take out a typical £200,000 mortgage at current interest rates of 3.89% for 25 years.

Initial payments will be £1,043 per month. But £648 of that is interest on day one.

So if you can find a property worth £250,000 that would be otherwise rented out for £650 or more - then it makes sense to buy rather than rent.

Says whom? Attractiveness has been sought   Out basically since the dawn of man. It is often how we deem people fit as leaders. Along with strength and cunning it is how pack leaders/alpha males were decided. You think it doesn't linger evolutionarily?

&gt; making jokes about the ways in which we vary.

There is a difference between that and making the ways we are different the joke. The sentiment here has made being gay the joke. 

My sexual orientation does not matter one bit. And like I said, homophobia has more to do with being afraid of homosexuality than being afraid of homosexuals. The word is fine. 

Who is being thin skinned? You're suffering because you can't make a gay joke? That is absurd. 

&gt; How about they integrate in with the rest of the world instead of blaming everyone else? 

Majority rules, huh? I'm shaking my head. If that were the way things worked nothing would ever get better for marginalized groups.

&gt; Should ban all jokes that might offend someone?

Ban? No. But the people making them should be able to introspect enough to see how their words and actions affect other people. It's so selfish to live in a world thinking you don't affect others. 

&gt; I'm offended that chickens can't cross a road WITHOUT THEIR ENTIRE SPECIES BECOMING A JOKE.

Comparing homosexuals to animals is no way to win an argument. Now, I'm not implying those are your intentions, but if you can't find the differences there are bigger problems at bay. 

&gt; Light hearted homosexual jokes are like any other, it shows the group is coming into society rather than being kept out of it. 

Homosexuality doesn't have to be denigrated for a homosexual to he light hearted. And that wouldn't keep them from laughing about themselves either. 

&gt; I'm sure people from 50+ years ago would kill for the tolerance we have now,

Being better than it was is not justification for continued mistreatment. 

If you think judging the attractiveness of men is ""being gay"" then you are naive. That undermines a lot of what homosexuals actually experience and who they are. Calling an entire board ""gay"" just because of that says a lot more about you. Why does it need to be said? What makes you so uncomfortable that you have to point out how different tjat is? Why is heteronormativity so necessary? Lots of questions that people should ask themselves, but instead just selfishly think everyone else should change to suit their needs. :/",0,1405948365,null,0,false,0,cj3da8p,t3_2b80g6,t1_cj3da8p,t1_cj3a4uo,null,1434820116,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Anyway - thanks for those stats, it was more to be like 'hey with regards to your argument, it's good to include the stats within your post'. I found a few articles on the topic and I do not disagree with the sentiment - it seems that in the UK a 3rd of rape cases were dropped (source)[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25964991].

I think naturally we're going to be on two sides of the fence with regards to this, as you are close to someone who was the victim of rape, and I am close to some people who were the victims of a false rape allegation, and being human beings it's tough to look at things objectively when the subject hits so close to home.

&gt;I just got very annoyed because from their line of questioning I could tell that they had made their minds up already and weren't pursuing the matter seriously or even with the intent to find out the truth. It seemed like they just wanted the matter wrapped up and written off so that they didn't have to deal with it.

This is something I've heard a lot of actually. Purely anecdotal, but I've heard many cases of police actually having quotas to meet, and to have *another* open-ended case on the books is just bad publicity and bad annual crime figures. If they know it's been too long to actually have any useful evidence, they know from experience they're not going to get a conviction and so it's better for *them* to close the case, morality be damned. Unfortunately with few independent governing bodies 'watching over', it's going to be a tough struggle to sort it out.

&gt;I understand your fear but I don't think you realise that that isn't how it works.

I absolutely understand how it works *currently*, but you start introducing 'catch-all' kinds of legislation, you're playing with fire.

I think your last paragraph is one that I think is most important. It is shitty, but it really is down to the victim and the victim's support network to enforce reporting. The police can only do so much with regards to rape, and then they just end up in this horrible vicious circle where the victim and their support network is saying, 'You don't care! You need to do more!' and the Police are saying, 'We've *done* all we can, we cannot prove that the alleged *actually* did it, it's your word against his and we cannot convict,'

And I am *glad* they don't just automatically side with the victim, because occasionally the victim is lying.

&gt;Police need to take rape seriously, I know that if this girl gets raped again she won't got to the police because that experience taught her that they don't care and they won't take you seriously. I expect many other women are in that situation.

And *this* is the crux of the issue. If, god forbid, your friend *were* to be raped again, this is the exact *opposite* of what she should do. You think the fucking scumsucking excuse for a human being that raped her is going to turn themselves in? It really is down to the victim to get a rape test and report it to the Police within *hours* of it happening, and they need their support network to ensure this happens. I can only imagine how consuming being raped must be, how utterly destructive, and it's very likely you just want your mind taken off of it rather than deal with hours and hours in a hospital and at a police station, but it is your responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen again to another person, especially when the crime is so difficult to prove.

I really don't think there's any other way around it, bar advanced methods of determining via scientific/medical practises who the victim has had sexual contact with and how recently and whether it was consensual. I have seen first hand how destructive a rape allegation can be, and I feel very sorry for the people who have to investigate it - it's a bloody, jagged maze that you may never fully navigate.",0,1405948474,null,0,false,0,cj3dbk5,t3_2b8iww,t1_cj3dbk5,t1_cj3cqhx,null,1434820125,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If there is no evidence of rape and someone tells the media you have raped them they have slandered you and the media has libelled you, you are entitled to compensation to un-ruin your life.

Admittedly this policy could be worded in a less sexist way ie 'suspected rapists' rather than 'men suspected of rape', however it is not targeting ALL men indiscriminately therefore I don't believe the policy is sexist.

How do you not get this?

Firstly the media is not at risk of libel for quoting the accuser. They can report on the story as long as they themselves dont make any unfounded claims.

Secondly, you want a person who has just lost a job their family and friends, to go to court and actually pay money to get exonerated?

I would stay away from oldskool accountants that need you to fill in excel sheets and fax them paperwork. Too much hassle.

I would also stay away from these on-line accountants where you have 1 qualified accountant per a thousand customers. Yeah their portals are really nice and funky and have loads of functionality but that just means you end up doing most of the work.

Mine is a bit of a happy medium. They are a traditional accountancy but they have spent a lot of time working on their portal. All I have to do each month is login, input my invoices, input my expenses and mileage and click done. It then calculates each month my running totals and potential dividends. And I can pickup the phone and my accountant will answer the phone and help me out with whatever I need.

Every so often he gets in touch and lets me know of things I can do to save money.

Overall very happy with them, been using them for nearly 4 years now. Bit pricier but well worth the extra money in my opinion.

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"It's just another example of the club finding more creative ways of exploiting the supporters loyalty for more money.

I wrote in depth about this in respect of our yearly 10% increase of seasoncards, and how our individual tickets are now among the most expensive in the league, here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/257i3r/season_ticket_prices_rise_by_10_again/

But was bombarded with downvotes, since on this subreddit any criticisms of the club are blasphemy (that, and I wasn't very popular around that period due a series of heated debates).

But the reality is that City are adopting all the lowest exploitative and commercial tactics that we used to deride United for.

We're no longer loyal supporters, we're merely a revenue stream. That's how we're perceived now.

And City can get away with the continued annual price increases of everything from tickets to food and drink, due to having no fan representation group to lobby the club and force them to recognise issues pertinent to us - the fans.

Liverpool fans have the Spirit of Shankly for example.

We have no equivalent.

And it allows the club to push though anything they wish without opposition from us.

They make constant noises about listening to our views, City voice etc. But it's all tokenised garbage, surveys with loaded questions etc, surveys on new schemes they're considering which we're largely indifferent about etc.

They've binned off Points of Blue, where supporters could meet with representatives of the club, and raise whatever issues the supporters had.

They've continually ignored the complaints about what the fans care about most, affordability. The cost of attending City matches.

And they're doing so because it's become the club agenda to increase the club revenue by any means necessary, that includes match day revenue, and entirely shitting over the supporters in the process.

It's mine, and many other supporters biggest issue with City at the moment, and is a something which is a point of major disillusionment.",1,1405950302,null,0,false,0,cj3dzi6,t3_2badm6,t1_cj3dzi6,t3_2badm6,null,1434820459,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

A benefit of HS2 is it will provide fast transport links between facilities in the UK's major cities. A greater number of organisations will see that they can have larger or cheaper facilities away from the capital and, while their daily needs can be met with teleconferencing, staff and clients can quickly get too or from London and back within the working day.

Having said this, I don't think it will diminish the impression people have that the UK is London-centric. Cities outside London will grow, but so will London.

Once that's done any overpayment should be returned to you automatically through payroll.

I had to make a database of just the reboots since there were conflicting names/episode numbers on DISH Net's episode guides. (The databases on the internet helped, but it seems the U.S. just doesn't get certain ones ever.) I now have most of the reboots (except a few specials), minus a few from ""S2"" (2006) — notably a few I've noticed people listing here, like Impossible Planet/Satan Pit. If I don't have them all by Christmas, that's what I'll ask for for Christmas. :)

That's awesome to hear about 4 and 7, though. It's not that I don't like 10 and 11 (because I really do); I was just sort of mindblown by 9, I suppose. But I'll miss Matt S as 11.

Anyway, I agree. It's as though the club has realised the only fact that gets printed with reagrd to ticket prices is lowest season ticket cost; by selling a tiny amount (and I mean tiny, with respect to the total number of STs: is it only a couple of hundred?) of £299 tickets, they come across as the cheapest club to go and see to the public, which is all they really care about. Actual ('normal') season tickets are not too badly priced, but the real sting is in the matchday tickets. Last year I paid £58 to watch us v Liverpool, £58 for West Ham, £56 for them lot, £50 for Barca etc etc. 

Yes I know that these are high demand games, and therefore the ticket cost should vaugely reflect demand, but these prices are ludicrous. I'm not sure how much matchday tickets were 5, 10, or 15 years ago as I had a ST that entire time, but I'm sure they were around the £30 mark. As the Bayern president said, why extort your fans when the amount of money you make of them can be gone in the space of a couple of minutes of transfer negotiations. 

If city really want to be part of the community, then start charging fans reasonable prices. I've already been priced out of a season ticket (you try finding reasonable priced train tickets from London to Manchester 19 times a year), and I'm starting to now be priced out of just going to a couple of home games a year.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"OK, that gives me enough information to start offering tips.

First off, I'd recommend visiting a few cities if you can, possibly in this order (the rail network lends itself to this order): London, then up the east coast to Edinburgh (the overnight sleeper train is apparently very good), over to Glasgow, down to Manchester and Liverpool, then to Birmingham, thence to Bristol, Bath, and on to Southampton and Portsmouth, then perhaps Brighton and then back to London.

I suggest this route for the following reasons:

1. London is full of museums, culture, things to see and do, etc, and is an obvious starting place if you fly in. And, if you fly in to elsewhere you can adjust the circular route to accommodate your chosen airport.
1. Edinburgh is another city full of culture, museums, etc as well as a very nice castle. Edinburgh is also the Capital city of Scotland, so you would be visiting two capitals on this route!
1. Glasgow has a fair few museums, lots of culture etc.
1. Manchester, whilst it might not sound very appealing to people who live in the UK, has a lot of history surrounding a lot of things, from trains to industry to football. Liverpool is very close by and also has a lot of history because of it's links with the shipping industry. 
1. Birmingham is another industrial city with a rich patchwork of heritage and culture. The Bull Ring is one of the best shopping centres in the world and should be visited even if you don't particularly want to shop.
1. Bristol is another industrial city, but had a focus on iron-working rather than goods production as Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield etc did, although Sheffield is known for it's high quality steel. Bristol has a lot of museums and history.
1. Bath is famous for it's Roman Baths, as well as it's picturesque location. There are good hiking routes around this area, although there are plenty in almost any area in the UK. In Bath there is also ""The American Museum in Britain"", which claims to be the only museum of Americana outside the USA.
1. Southampton and Portsmouth are on the south coast of the country, and are both major ports in their own rights, which means they both have a lot of naval history and seafaring culture. Portsmouth has the Historic Dockyard, which houses, amongst a lot of other things, HMS Victory, the Flagship of Admiral Lord Nelson who commanded the British fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, as well as HMS Warrior, the first iron hulled warship in the world, and the remains of The Mary Rose, Flagship of King Henry VIII which sank after heeling over in the 1500s in Portsmouth harbour whilst fighting a French Invasion. There are also other attractions in Portsmouth and Southampton, and a good bit of culture to boot. I may be biased though as my grandparents live in Southampton and I went to university in Portsmouth ;-)
1. Brighton is a wonderful multicultural city known for good architecture and seaside fun, and it's LGBT celebration events.

York minster is great to visit, a bit pricey for full admission, but it's worth visiting even if you don't pay to go in.

Walking the city walls is something you absolutely have to do, and somewhere along them there is a brewery tap for one of the local breweries, that I recommend (don't remember the name of it, maybe someone can help you there.)

There's of course the jorvik viking museum, and the archaological dig, both of which are interesting, if you're into that kind of thing.

There's also the Richard III museum, which is tiny and cheap.

The national railway museum, which I've never been to, but is great if you like trains..

There's a lot of great pubs and bars too, and tons of really nice local ale.

Some of the ""ghost tours"" are actually quite funny and worth going on - I've been on one that actually gave a lot of very interesting history too, as well as the (pretty daft) ghost stories. Essentially it's a guided tour around the city at night - seems silly, but actually was informative and interesting.

And of course, if you get outside of the city itself you're spoiled for choice with places to go walking and see beautiful countryside.

I don't think you'll find a better place to visit, given what you're looking for.

Personally, I'm more of an outdoorsy-type, so I always head for Wales, (Snowdonia and the west coast of wales) for a bit of camping, cycling and climbing. If you're interested in heading down that way for a bit of walking, let me know and I can give you some recommendations for that (but it's not easy to get there, especially from York, and there's a lot of walking to be done up in Yorkshire too).",0,1405953361,null,0,1405953651,0,cj3f8u8,t3_2baiwv,t1_cj3f8u8,t1_cj3ej1v,null,1434821020,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

All these players have to get used to an entirely new system that they're gonna be playing, and even if they do end up getting Vidal, there's always that one year adjustment period where you have to get used to a league so even then he won't be playing to maximum ability.
I'd give Man U a year to gel and whatever to get back into contention for top 4.

It is very easy to pick Chelsea as favorites, it was for my other friend who touted them to win the league last year but what I've noticed last year is that Chelsea have had a constant habit of dropping points needlessly last year. Signing Fabregas and Costa won't stop them from conceding those 2 goals against stoke where Assaidi scored the last goal, nor where agent Borini did the same. Now you could say that they would help create/score more goals which I agree is a legitimate case, but as you said I don't think they would do it even more effectively to overcome what I said before. Plus it remains to be seen how the really attacking fabregas will deal with Mourinho wanting him to track back more and be more defensive.

A good example would be the Gold value seasoncards, tokenism at its purest. 

But another left field one that I recall well was when we won the title in spectacular fashion 2 years ago. During the pitch invasion a young lad grabbed the match ball after Joe Hart had hoofed it at the final whistle. The club, in all its infinite wisdom, identified the lad in question via CCTV and decided it best to send the police to his home to arrest him. The police then brought him to the club, 'de-arrested' him, and proceed to have him threatened with a lifetime ban by the notorious Peter Fletcher (for those who don't know he was the then head of security at the stadium, and had a very bad rep) if he didn't return the ball he'd 'stolen'.

This was a 16 year old lad.

What followed was the lad's father complaining to the club and discovering the police denied knowledge of the arrest. With the club backtracking he threatened to go to the press with how they'd attempted to bully and intimidate a young fan.

Not long after that, the lad appeared on the club website in a video lightheartedly ceremonially handing over the match ball to Joe Hart on the pitch, to be given a signed pair of gloves in exchange.

That, was fucking terrible.

But in a wider sense, it seems to be part of a recurring theme of the club not giving a shit about the fans. The club makes all the right public messages, but it rarely materialises in actions.

The ticket prices issue is the most important to fans. Everything else is small fry.

The club knows this, but doesn't care.

And now it risks disillusioning, and ultimately pricing out, the very fans that allowed this club to become what it is today. The fans that supported this club in the lean years, only to have their loyalty rewarded by pricing them out of the successful years.

Makes me angry to be honest. At this rate in 3 years our match going fanbase will resemble nothing like the one it used to prior to the takeover, probably being vis-a-vis for Stamford Bridge or Old Trafford.

I would say that attitudes towards shale are quite mixed in the department.

Skype conversations is something that has been suggested for years, but not done yet - we seriously just *need to get it fucking done*. It obviously doesn't help those in the countryside/with terrible internet but this is slowly changing. Most broadband connections can handle a Skype conversation.

Online booking - why the fuck are we using such an out dated piece of technology (phone)? Put the damn thing online. The only reason we've stuck with phone conversations is that the receptionist can ask you to detail your problem to see if it needs an urgent 10 minute slot somewhere. 

That shouldn't change much. Surgeries still hold back some appt's for urgent cases and tell people that they can submit a form which will be read by the surgery and they'll call them back - that way the receptionists still have an idea of how ""urgent"" it is, keeping the appointment phone system for older people &amp; those without internet access.

Any problems with my appt? No sweat it, get's sent to my email which is picked up by my phone instantly. Come on, it's not new technology even. It's been around for years (smartphones, internet etc) so let's *start to fucking use it*!

Prescriptions - why are we using *paper*? What the shit? We are in **2014**. *STUFF IT ONLINE*! Keep the paper option for those who don't have internet access but for those that do - it means that I can order my prescription without having to fumble about looking for my previous repeat slip or for a piece of paper to write what I need down. It's also likely to speed up the whole damn thing because there is no time wasted for the signed prescription going back and forth between the receptionist and the GP.

It also means that if surgery fuck up my prescription (which always happens, because there are so many moving parts between it being requested to having the tablets in your hand) then it's easier to solve. I don't have to wait for my GP to have a spare 5 minutes (which they don't!) to fix their mistake in my prescription, wait for them to give it to receptionist for me to take time off work (because let's face it, surgeries are pretty much open  9-5, sometimes 6!) to go and collect it *again*.

Next summer we got players who we thought could replace and some just deepen the squad and first eleven. We took the successful ones and weeded out the failures, again we will attempt this with hopefully more success due to shopping at higher quality market.  
Save for mental breakdown most of our players have come from teams that play similar attacking style to what we play. Southampton players are on top of that also in the same league. Remy has shown that he isn't Papis Cisse or Ba or any other half a season success, in multiple teams. Not only that he isn't someone we are trying to shoehorn in, his playing style of directness and speed fits us. Markovic is the one I doubt most, only due to his age and relative lack of end product, but this was his first season at a top league and he did well to adapt to both new and far stronger league and new country/culture. That gives me hope he will settle down even if he doesn't produce a lot for the first full season.


Henderson and  Downing were classed as failures at first, but BR found a place for them, integrated them in to his team and got the best out of them. If 2 of Lallana, Markovic, Remy and Origi don't work out BR will still find a role for them while further strengthening the squad and replace them if needed.

For your example that's pretty much what our seasoncards are looking like now. Seasoncards don't include cup games, they include 19 league fixtures only.

Using your example that would equate to £742 for 19 games, my seasoncard was £780 this season. And given you'd probably pay less for more fixtures in bulk your example would probably be even cheaper in a like for like comparison.

That said, my season ticket is just above the average, which would probably be around £620 - £700.

But it's important that you consider this from perspective of what football means in the UK. It's historically been a working class sport, a big part of people's lives. Now, if you're on a low income being part of it will cost you a large part of your income, so it simply isn't viable for a lot of people anymore, and it's getting increasingly bad from this perspective.

What used to make English football so special was the fans, the atmosphere that came from it being the sport of the working class. That's what has allowed the Premier League to be marketed as the most attractive league in the world (tm).

But now, as the clubs try and cash in on that exposure, prices are continually increasing and it's acting like gentrification in stadia all across the UK, but particularly England. And that means that the atmospheres are vanishing and the stadiums are becoming sterile and corporate, Americanised for all intents and purposes.

true,lurklikeaboss,num23-away,,"Well, after our last two were sold to Real Madrid, the writing is on the wall. Real is the biggest club in the world, and they get who they want regardless of cost. I don't think you can specifically blame the club for it, but just this season we've seen Lloris sign a new extension and pledge his loyalty instead of going off to PSG when he had every right to. He's truly world class and deserves to play in the Champions League, but chose to stay, that is a big deal. On top of that Vertonghen looks to be staying (although the window isn't over and Barca have been sniffing around him). 

We have fantastic players, but until the new stadium goes up and until we can truly offer these guys Champions League year in and year out while maintaining the financial might to compete with the top clubs, the fact is, selling our best players will always be a possibility. But, if you ask me, that's not an indictment of the club as much as it is the situation the club is in at the moment. Levy has shown his willingness to hold onto the best talent, and only sells when he has no other choice, and only for his valuation. 

Basically, what I'm saying is that we will have our best players poached from us from time to time, but so does most everyone else. In the end though, choosing a team really shouldn't be  about all that, in my opinion. It's the team that speaks to you, the one you find yourself gravitating toward and you don't even know why. The team that makes you happy to watch the game. Spurs were that for me back in 2008, and I've been all in ever since, every game, every week, every shit Europa league location. No matter what.

Let's ignore all the complicated costs and do it simple-ass FIFA style of transfer cost and wages. Let's say for the sake of argument (I have no idea what the values are so these are guesstimates) Borini has 3 years left at 2.5 million a year. Say we sign remy on a 5 year deal, 5 million a year. 14 million for Borini plus the 7.5 million we don't have to pay him in wages becomes 21.5 million saved. Pay 8.5 million for remy plus the reported 5 million a year for the same 3 years becomes a 23.5 million spend over 3 years. So it would cost us more to have Remy for 3 years if these values are right, but we don't know what those values are.. This is ignoring all sorts of complicated contractual things  and agent fees and a load of other mad stuff that are thrown on top. Now remy could sign on a smaller wage than that £5m/year which might not make it a loss. What you're wrongly assuming is that the wage difference only matters for one year. In the long term the remy in Borini out deal could cost us more or it could save us a bit, but it won't (as you initially said) save us £6m (assuming the highly likely situation where Remy is paid more than Borini).

true,JaR82,flair3,,"Welcome, and please excuse my wall of text - variants of which have been written here before, but this is my quick take on it which I'm writing instead of working.

Being a Spurs fan is incredibly exciting because you're constantly let down; but in the same breath, constantly optimistic. It's basically like how I'd describe being British to anyone else from around the world. You have to have a self-deprecating sense of humour because although we're actually really rather good - we never seem to quite be able to push on and live up to our expectations. 

When we qualified for the Champions League for the first time (and currently only... thanks Chelski), I don't think I've ever seen a happier bunch of supporters. It means we appreciate that the realistic position of the club is the lower end of the top 6, but that we *could* breach the top 4, and that's what makes it exciting. We're not Man City, or Chelsea who have bought our way into the top - and who expect to win every week. We'd love to, but we've fought, and inched our way up from relegation /mid-table fodder to regularly fighting for Europe, and *sometimes* (whisper it) even higher. We know what it's like to have earnt a position.

If you're a glory hunter, then jog-on - basically.

We have had, and do have world class players in our squad and we seem very good at pulling the odd surprise. From Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa in the early 80's - two of the world's biggest stars at the time who no-one saw coming - to Waddle and Gazza in the late 80s, Popescu and Klinsmann in the 90's, and more recently King, Berbatov, Bale and now Lloris - we have always had World Class players, although not always World Class when we buy them.

That's when we struggle to keep them - although that's not for lack of trying - we have actually had a reasonably successful last few years and have a strong platform to build on. For the first transfer window in a long time, I actually feel like we know what we're doing.

We have recently committed one of the top 5 goalkeepers in the world to a 5 year contract, and we have potentially one of the best Attacking Midfielders in the world in Eriksen - not to mention a potential world-beater in a Lamela who has a lot to prove.

We are a club with an illustrious history, a club who always want to win, and win with style. We expect to have World Class players, and expect them to then disappear - but this will all change, and I can sense the tide turning now. A new larger stadium on the way means more income, and that allayed with our state of the art training stadium (which apparently impresses every prospective player) means that we have an ideology players buy into.

tldr; don't follow the player, follow the club.",0,1405956903,null,0,false,0,cj3gxop,t3_2basqd,t1_cj3gxop,t3_2basqd,null,1434821785,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

**Council apologises for calling local pensioner 'a pest'**

The Local Shitsheet brings you the inside story of the unforgivable council response to a local pensioner's modest request to have her fine reduced, so she could afford to continue to feed the local homeless cat population.

'Apparently, letters from old women are just a big joke to this council' fumed local resident A.N. Other. 'My poor gran feels ashamed and betrayed. To be called a pest by the people elected to serve the community, after the years my gran has spent...well, it's just shameful.'

When reached for comment, the council stated that a subordinate had clearly overstepped the mark. 'We regret that such a facetious letter was sent on official council business, and we will endeavour to ensure council communication on official matters remains just that: official.'",0,1405957326,null,0,1405959519,0,cj3h58s,t3_2baitx,t1_cj3h58s,t1_cj3fde3,null,1434821910,82,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,82

Which meant that things being put online (prescriptions, appointment booking and the appointment itself) was *at the bottom* of the list - mainly because most of them admitted they didn't know how to use the computer and preferred speaking to someone face to face or over the phone. This is fueled by the media constantly showing the internet and online activities as being insecure, so older people don't feel confident with it. So even though one of highest feedback items was ""I'd like to be able to book an appointment with my GP online"", the group was vastly of the opinion that ""it's one of the lower priority items"". A few younger people cannot shout over a group of about 30/40 55+ members.

It was also the same in my previous surgery too. Too many old people mean the surgery get the wrong idea of ""what do our patients want"".

This part seems to be rooted in some rumours surrounding the FFF/Deschamps.....Word floating around (who the hell really knows) is that Deschamps has told the French players that they need to be playing in the top leagues in Europe and ideally with teams that are playing against European competition for them to make the French squad.

Schneiderlin snuck onto the French squad and has only received 2 caps for the national squad thus far in his career and people are pointing to the fact that Soton weren't in Europe as one of the reasons.  Now this could be complete and utter bullshit (personally i think it is just a fractional cause to why he wasn't getting selections for the FFF as let's face it the French team is fairly deep in the deep CM/CDM role)....but it would also fit as to why he is seemingly ""open"" to a move to either Spurs or Arsenal over staying at Soton.

The rest of it....who knows, there is enough talk about him as a target that it is highly likely that he is on our list of players to bring in. he speaks highly of Poch so maybe that is really the selling point.

Rose always looks like he's about one step away from totally falling apart.  He's always frantically trying to get into position, and on attack he's so fast but can't really control.  I just always want him to turn his gifts into something great, but most of our fans think that's never happening.

Davies looks like he knows what he's doing, and that if you're going to build out of the back, he's the player to do it.  A sort of defensive playmaker.  Not a ton of pace, but he may not need it if he's smart enough.

People outside of Southampton seem to be very concerned with us, using words like dismantle, destruction and falling apart, however, what people seem to praise one minute and forget the other, is our youth system, no spot lost cant be replaced well by our youth, Targett already looks solid enough to replace Shaw, JWP has been set to replace Lallana for a while, and Gally is in development for Lambert. And thats without mentioning Reed who has seemed good, and McQueen who is making it hard to forget about him, and looks absolute quality.

Now, thats all before signings, from one sale we have bought 2 replacements who are arguably better then their predessecors, both who look to score and set up plenty of goals, which is what we dearly lacked. And thats just 2 signings, with the likes of Forster/Marshall/~~Paulihno~~/Caulker/van Djik and more supposedly in the works.

And if the reports of Lovren and Schneiderlin and to be true, im not fussed on them either, we have plenty of CB Youths, and failing that, Caulker/van Djik and that Dusco Tosic, the LB/CB we have been linked with today I believe. And Schneiderlin? Once again, plenty of youth prospects, or even people we already have, Cork and Wanyama played well together when he was out. And they arent positions that are hard to fill for less then we sell them for, so more left over for squad bolstering.

 [**Network congestion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20congestion): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [data networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_networking) and [queueing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory), __network congestion__ occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data that its [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service) deteriorates. Typical effects include [queueing delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_delay), [packet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss) or the [blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_probability) of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that an incremental increase in [offered load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offered_load) leads either only to a small increase in network [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput), or to an actual reduction in network throughput.

&gt;[Network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol) which use aggressive [retransmissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks\)) to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion even after the initial load has been reduced to a level which would not normally have induced network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as __congestive collapse__.

&gt;Modern networks use congestion control and congestion avoidance techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) in protocols such as [802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11)'s [CSMA/CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance) and the original [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet), [window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window) reduction in [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_control_protocol), and [fair queueing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_queueing) in devices such as [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing\)). Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [802.1p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.1p). A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [ITU-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T) [G.hn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn) standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) [Local area networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"I don't agree. Of course you can attend another club's game to get your 'fix', but it'd be as a neutral, it would be devoid of any real importance, there's no connection.

Our most expensive season ticket next year will be more than £1000, I know as the club has sent out letters to people who currently sit in those areas of the stadium as a forewarning. Besides, the fact that some season tickets are going for much more is a total disgrace, and is part of the wider problem.

Lastly, I'm actually really annoyed by the fact that the 'Gold Value' season tickets kept being used as an defence of our ticket prices. But that was their purpose.

They're on an application basis, and the club decide where you sit. They're a tiny minority of our season tickets, they are only sold in very limited numbers, a few hundred possibly, less than one percent of total season tickets. 

They are a token gesture, designed to allow the club to say they have the cheapest season tickets in the league, while the whole trend is yearly increases of 10% with our average season ticket price now being double what it was 6 years ago.

The diff is when Israel was founded we thought of countries, not people. Today, we think of people. As a country, Israel is a valuable asset to the west, and is aligned with us as well as being a major trade partner. I think honestly either way a lot of people are gonna die. If Israel lays down its arms and stops defending itself then I wouldn't doubt that either palestine or another arab country would be quick on killing a lot of Jews. Israel only exists in its current form because of the way it acts to reduce harm to itself. That's what the whole Gaza offensive is about.

The difference is the Palestinians don't want a two state solution, but Israel has agreed to it numerous times. In all honesty, what the palestinians want (I cba getting links but google 'palestinians dont want 2 state solution' or something), is all of historical palestine. That's totally unrealistic and never gonna happen. Why wouldn't Israel try to conquer it all when the general opinion is that it should all be arab? This is going way back, even to the time of Israel's formation. Palestinians disagreed on a two state solution while Israelis accepted it.

Assuming not, there's pretty much 0 chance of getting to the united game, nor most of the other 'big' games (any of arsenal/chelsea/liverpool/spurs etc.) You can ask city for a 'hospitality package' to one of the big games, but that would mean forking over almost a grand for 2 tickets. Other than that your best bet is to ask on bluemoon for some but it's doubtful you'll get anything, especially 2 together, in all honesty.

Assuming you buy 2 cityzen cards (70 quid for the pair), you might get to one of the big-ish games, i.e., everton, newcastle etc, otherwise if you wait for general sale you'll be stuck with the bottom 6 clubs. Obviously there's more of a chance of getting tickets to midweek/re-arranged fixtures, but that would probably clash with your/your dads work plans.

Also be aware that the ony tickets you'll get will most probably be up in the gods if you want 2 together, hardly the best for atmosphere/enjoyment of the game.

Tickets are usually 40ish each for the small matches, and 55-60ish for the big matches.

He's clearly talented and I'm sure he'll be important for us, but Lallana looked dangerous everytime he got on the ball, and did a whole load of pressing for us last season. To expect Tadic to replace all that is asking too much.   
  
Lambert could be easier to replace as he didn't actually have that great of a season last year. Lovren was the best centre back I've seen at Saints in a while, but that may have been because he had Wanyama in front of him at the start. I'll be very disappointed if Schneiderlin goes. 
  
Anyway, I'd be delighted with top half this season, and then after a year of Koeman getting his ideas into the squad, having the ability to mould the team to just the way he wants it, we can give challenging the upper echelons of the table another go.

Regarding this, I fully agree with Gaza and I wholeheartedly agree why they don't want a two state solution (even though I think it should happen for peace), of course they don't want a two state solution. Imagine if all the Polish people, or Pakistani people, or any immigrant nationalities got together in a single area in the UK, then declared that area to be their lands, put up walls around the place, kicked out the native British people and not let anyone back and also treat any left over British people to be third class citizens, then I'm sure you'd be overly pissed off (probably go to 'war' with them to take your land back). I doubt you'd agree to a two state solution here.

Same thing in Palestine. I wouldn't want a two state solution if I was a Palestinian. But tbh, if there is going to be peace in that area, It'll probably be a two state solution, one day Palestinians would have to suck it up, admit they were invaded and give up their land. -&gt; This is awfully unfair don't you think?

Medical experts are calling it a crisis-level event.

If the council don't change their approach, the trend is likely to continue. Unconfirmed reports have been coming in of people expiring simply from touching a council envelope; the thin paper being unable to effectively contain the extreme levels of boredom within.

It didn't take me long to figure out that /r/doctorwho is nothing but fan art and pictures of Tardis dresses, cakes, and Jack-o-lanterns. Most actual discussion was going on over in /r/gallifrey (self posts only), so I mostly hang out over there.

When I started watching Classic who, I was tickled to death by this ridiculous hat Hartnell wore in Reign of Terror, so I headed over to the sub where pictures are allowed and posted a screenie, to share how much fun I was having with that strange old man. I got the same message you did, and it totally killed my buzz. 

Here's the thing, /r/doctorwho: I don't like Pintrest. I don't care about cakes or cross stitching or cosplay. I don't mind seeing those things in my feed, but if that's the entirety of your content, and posting pics from the show for discussion and appreciation isn't allowed, I'm out. The only reason I'm still subscribed is because actual news tends to show up here before it hits /r/gallifrey. I scroll past almost everything from this sub because again - Pintrest. 

I know no one cares, but for the record, this sub actually dampened my enthusiasm for the show with its strict rules and its preference for endless streams of arts and crafts over discussion stimulating pictures from the actual show. So I pretty much left, because there's nothing here for me.

It sounds like the reason is that too many people post too many potentially spoilery things when new episodes are airing. But if you don't want people sharing their excitement over the show, why are you here? If I can scroll past this week's 100th Tardis dress, others can surely scroll past the posts of people who are excited about this week's *episode*. That's what spoiler tags - not to mention mods - are for.

If you can't even drink water without the sufferance of another nation then you don't have independence.

Hamas aren't angels but Israel is also operating from a position of outright belligerence. The Israeli policy in the region has been the same one they used with Egypt and Syria. Take a lot, offer to give some of it back. Reduce how much is on the table repeatedly until the other side gives in. That isn't the action of a nation looking for an honest peace. It also won't work here because unlike with Egypt (who cared about their occupied territory for reasons of prestige more than necessity), the Palestinians literally have no real option but to acquire the 1947 borders without much in the way of modification.

It is also still very questionable how well this Israel policy will stand up in the long term. I mean they are saying the Golan Heights are never going back to Syria. Never is a very long time. So far the Israeli policy has worked well for getting them short term peace in periods where the west has been most friendly with them.

If he says on Thursday, ""I like waffles and babies"" and on Friday, ""I like french toast and murder,"" to what degree is that or can that be considered the same person? If it's too far of a swing, just saying ""I look completely different but I used to know someone named Sarah and I still remember that I used to know her"" isn't super convincing.

That's why I like moments like the hologram avatar dealie, where he sees Rose and Martha and comments on the guilt.

Yeah and it made the problem much, much worse. Our belligerent bullshit gave the IRA something they lacked for most of the conflict. It gave them legitimacy. Nothing gives an insurgency a free hand like a government willing to slaughter civilians.

&gt; The truth of NI is that we got peace because most of the active players in NI wanted peace. And we won't see peace in Israel until both the Israeli government and groups such as Hamas decide they want peace. As things are Hamas is just as responsible for the violence in Gaza as the Israelis are.

That was part of a very long term strategy from the UK to simultaneously undermine the fuel that was driving people to the IRA (i.e. no more Bloody Sunday's) and legitimise the political arm of the IRA so that honest negotiation on a sensible settlement with the republicans could be achieved.

It's ridiculous that it's legal to just join any army you like, as long as it is a state force. You could join the Ugandan army if you wanted, or any other military with a large history of brutality. But join a rebel group (even ones that the UK are funding...) and people start throwing their toys out of the pram. 

Let's be honest, what ""moderate"" rebel groups like the FSA do is barely any different to what the IDF do, the only difference is the hardware they have access to. 

The hysteria in this country is so ridiculous right now that someone going to Syria as a fucking doctor to treat FSA combatants is seen as a terrorist. ISIS has become this giant bogeyman like Al Queda before it was.

Daily reminder that the *minimum* you need to save for your pension is 1/2 of the age you started saving, as a percetage of your income.

e.g. if you start saving for a pension at 30, you need to put aside *at least* 15% of your gross pay. That'll give you a pension pot of around £250,000 if you save for thirty-five years. That £250,000 will buy you an annuity of (wait for it), roughly £8,000/pa if you go for a joint-life policy at 65 (in today's money - in 2049 it'll be something stupid like £400,000pa).

In reality you probably need to save double or tripple that to see a comfortable retirement.

&gt;However, as a technician it's also quite easy to stumble across personal information - you want to check their files copied across, so you look in My Documents; the customer complains that Word isn't working or their can't view images, you look for a file of that type.

And that can't be checked by making sure the file sizes are identical?  Or by running a comp command in CMD?

Hell there's more than enough ways to check file integrity and document corruption without actually viewing the content.

&gt;Folders show previews of images these days, and files show up in ""recently opened"" history menus. I think some versions of Picasa would offer, by default, to index every image on the computer, and then show a screen full of thumbnails every time it was opened. 

But there's no need for the technician to actually access the folders let alone the files. Comparisons and checks can be made at Metadata level or autonomously. No need to view the actual content.

&gt;There are myriad ways that technicians see things they don't want to.

Sure, if they don't value their customers privacy. 

&gt;I say ""they don't want to"" on the assumption the techies are ethical -  I would guess that many of the juniors working at PC World are not, and do indeed snoop, and I'd guess that's statistically more likely. 

I'd say it's probably more common than people would like to admit unfortunately.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Well there's a lot to unload in there but I'll give it a go.

I don't know if we've been a ""big club"" in the sense so many people seem to mean since before I was a fan. So that's before our two CL finals, pre-Houllier. Who have we signed that has been world class upon arrival? That everyone expected them to be?

The reality is that right now the only ""big"" clubs are Madrid, Barca, and Bayern. These are clubs that can bring players purely on their own allure. Both City and Chelsea sign players based on expectation of their finish, the players in the squad, and the money they can offer. They aren't prestige clubs. Only United could be considered a prestige club in the Prem, but unfortunately after Fergie left they simply have lost that ground. Even with Fergie they had clearly been eclipsed by other clubs. What is the last big United signing that went of well? Van Persie doesn't even really count. You might have to go back to Tevez.

Arsenal aren't a big club. The only huge signings they've made have come in the last 2 years. Ozil and Sanchez. Every other signing, successful or not, that they've made have been guys hardly dissimilar in stature to the one's we're bringing in right now. Arsenal's big draw for a long time was CL, their playing style, and Arsene Wenger. They've sort of lost their playing style in recent years (having been eclipsed by clubs who do it better...cough...Liverpool...cough ahem). 


Where are Liverpool now compared to those types of clubs? Well we're in the CL but no one could argue we've consolidated that position. We could easily fall out. We've got a manager who got us playing the most attractive football in Europe. 

My firm belief is that next summer, if we can retain CL and play the same way we did last year but without Suarez, we're going to see Rodgers fully cement himself as being seen as a internationally renowned manager. He will have pull. Just the way all top managers do. We're already seeing some of this I feel. Young players know he'll give them a chance and he can get the best out of them. 

As far as a player to draw other players? I think that will, like the Rodgers point, come with another year of players blossoming. If Sturridge has another 20 goal season it's going to be hard to argue he isn't one of the best in Europe. If Sterling pushes on it'll be hard to argue he isn't one of the best. On pure form, last season he probably was the best under-20 year old player in the world. Coutinho could become that.

Sure, right now we're a squad of talented players but that's usually what the best teams are.

Will we handle the burden of more games? I guess we'll all find out together. I do believe Brendan is assembling a squad with very few holes. If we get another LB and guy who can operate out of midfield I'd call us set for depth. 


Lallana was overpriced but that doesn't mean he won't have an impact. He suits our style of play perfectly. He's two footed so he can easily play across the front and he's linking up with players he plays with for England. All this will contribute to a smoother transition. I also think he's going to benefit A LOT from having so little expectation. If he's involved for 20 goals for us in the PL I'd call that a good campaign. He isn't a David Silva or Fabregas but he's also English. You pay a premium for that.


As far as our defense I tend to side with those who think it's down to our setup. We're always going to give up more goals than other teams. I think Brendan has been smart to sign Lovren because he played defense in the style that we need in order to be successful with our attacking style. He and Sahko also both speak French. Do our fullbacks need improving? I'd say it's the weakest part of our team but Brendan also asks a lot from them. It'd be a tough job for anyone.



End of: do we need a marquee signing to shut up our critics? No and it won't shut them up. Nothing will be good enough until we do it again and again. And that's pretty fair actually.

Coutinho, in the first half of last year, didn't press hard and was rarely much of a threat. Sterling usurped his spot in the starting 11 and our fortunes changed with him in there. Then Lucas went down and Rodgers went for the 4-2-4 and Coutinho, in that Everton game I remember most of all, shot out the gate like a bat out of hell. He was pressing, he was dropping deep, he was finding holes. He earned his spot. Were there still holes in his game? Sure but he's a young lad. He proved he was hungry.

This summer I think he's proving it again. Not being picked by Brazil was a big slap in the face I think and I'm certain he's going to bust ass to put himself in the frame for selection. 

I can't predict what Rodgers will do and, if anything, I'm very nervous that he will drop Coutinho or Sterling from the beginning.

My hope and my belief about what we should do is just throw Lallana on for Suarez. We have so much attacking talent on our bench that we won't have to rely on scoring all our goals before we make changes. We've got goals in Lambert, Remy, and Marko on the bench. Not to mention our shit ton of young attacking talent that should be pushing for spots on the bench. 

I come from the school of ""if it's not broken don't fix it"". Rodgers, last year, sort of showed he wasn't a Benitez-like tinkerer for tinkerings sake. He wanted a firm best 11 and when he found it he stuck with them but for injuries. This year will require juggling but when we take the field against Southampton I think the only new Liverpool players on the field should be old Southampton ones (minus Lambert).",0,1405967854,null,0,false,0,cj3mx1n,t3_2bbfxh,t1_cj3mx1n,t3_2bbfxh,null,1434824674,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

And to respond to your friends' comments:
- We've just finished 2nd in the league and we're back in the Champions League. Hardly ""past our prime""
- We're Liverpool. We'll always be a draw. We've regularly signed players that 'bigger' clubs wanted down the years. Harry Kewell snubbed Man Utd for us in years past. Torres came to us, so did Suarez, plus a host of others. Champions League football and a young, bright manager only adds to our pull as a club
- We can only guess whether or not our squad will be able to cope without Suarez. It's logical to assume a club won't improve on the previous season when they've lost their best player. We'll have to wait and see. In BR we trust
- Lallana was in the PFA Premier League team of the year last year alongside Gerrard, Hazard and Toure. Suddenly £25m doesn't seem that overpriced. 
- Our defence WAS poor, but we've signed Lovren who I think will be brilliant alongside Sakho, and a left back is expected too.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I think it is interesting to look at the change in votes of the far right/ nationalist parties and UKIP between the 2009 European Elections and the 2014 European Elections. 

**2009:** |UKIP-16.6%| |BNP-6.3%| |English Democrats-1.9%|

**2014:** |UKIP-26.6%| |BNP-1.1%| |English Democrats-0.8%|

**Change:** |UKIP up 10%| |Far right/nationalist down 6.3%|

Now, the first assumption I make is that for someone on the far right, or a nationalist, of the major parties in the European elections (UKIP, Labour, Conservative, Greens, Lib Dems), UKIP would be the most popular choice. This isn't saying UKIP are literally fascist, but their views on immigration and the EU are more similar to those held by the BNP and English Democrats than the other major parties. 

The next assumption is over how many people who voted BNP/ED in 2009 voted at all in 2014. For all we know, they could have all chosen not to vote, and ~1 million new voters decided to vote in 2014 instead. However, due to us still being in the EU and having immigration they would consider too high, I would assume the vast majority of those who voted BNP or ED at the last EU elections voted in 2014. 

The final assumption is over how many people who voted BNP/ED in 2009 voted for UKIP specifically. Again, for all we know, they could have voted Labour (for example), with UKIP being swelled by disaffected Tories and Lib Dems. However, as I suggested earlier, of the big parties, UKIPs views match closest with those of the BNP and ED. That would suggest that many of those who voted BNP/ED in 2009, but didn't in 2014, voted UKIP. 

This is a bit of a shit hypothesis, with a lot of assumptions, but I think it just seems too convenient that far right/nationalist vote dropped by 6.3% between 2009 and 2014, and UKIP vote increased by 10%, for there to be no link whatsoever. Again, this isn't saying UKIP are literally fascist; it isn't to say that everyone who votes UKIP would vote BNP at the drop of a hat; it isn't saying that there aren't any reasonable non-fascists who decided to vote UKIP in 2014; and it isn't saying that UKIP views shouldn't be legitimately considered (if only to argue against them. What it is saying is that there is very likely a link between the drop in far right/ nationalist vote and the increase in UKIP vote, and that the recent swell in UKIP support isn't necessarily simply a growth of reasonable grassroots support.

Like anywhere in an inner city you'd exercise the normal cautions.

It's fairly popular with students due to the prices up there and there's a lot going on. It's a busy and diverse area (lots of Turkish shops, restaurants and barbers along with eastern European shops for example). Having a frequent 24 hour bus (the 29/N29) is a plus too.

A lot of my buddies support United or Arsenal or Liverpool and as I was getting more into the league I felt that I wanted to avoid just throwing in with them and one of those teams because it seemed too easy. So, I think that's why I never really settled on a club was I was just haphazardly watching whatever match was on by my self.

Your defence is undeniably poor, if i asked you your opinion on Man United's defence the majority of you would say it's awful or it's shit but they conceded 7 less than Liverpool last year.

Gerrard is clearly past his prime but that doesn't mean he's shit so it doesn't really matter.

If people here think that Liverpool will be as good going forward next year they're being naive, any player outside of Messi and Ronaldo is a clear downgrade on Suarez, so the attack is going to be worse. That doesn't mean Liverpool as a team will necessarily be worse, if a team scores 100 goals they should win the title, the fact that you didn't means there was a problem and the team wasn't well balanced. The Suarez money should help address that issue.

The part about Liverpool being past it's prime is stupid as well. Especially from an Arsenal fan. Arsenal have won an fa cup after 9 years and think they're the biggest team in the world.

There either isn't one, or it's not resulting in the financial benefits that were hoped for because of the use of private companies (which may be ideological too if IDS is snuggling up with ATOS etc. and actively helping them divert more and more DWP money while helping to cover up that they're not doing the work they're over paid for. I say 'if' but this is pretty much what's going on with Universal Credit). It's also possible they're paying private companies because they're rather effective shields  if anyone criticises the reforms while the DWP is currently bound by pesky things like human rights etc that stop them from legally implementing their ideology (don't forget the limited legal rights claimants have to challenge a DWP decision even when the decision abides by current human rights)

However, having been thinking a lot recently about potential reasons for having an ideology that favours increasing disadvantages faced by disadvantaged people (not just in terms of ESA claimants), I weirdly don't feel 100% depressed about the situation. Change is a possibility because one reason people may have that ideology is that people can't cope with an unjust world and so believe in a just world (a belief which is more common among those who are advantaged, makes a person more likely to be conservative, blame disadvantaged people for their disadvantages and try to disadvantage them some more). 

So the more people who're confronted with loved ones getting fucked over etc. the more likely that those specific people will stop believing in the ideology as they are forced to confront the fact that the world is not just and find other ways of dealing with inequality other than ignoring and worsening it. As a belief in a just world is caused by a person finding inequality unacceptable, they're the best people to 'target' to reduce ideological ridiculousness once they see their belief in a just world is propagating the inequality they found so unacceptable. Targeting the very very advantaged people who support shitty ideologies because of their belief in a just world is more difficult though as they're so far removed from the negative consequences of their ideology that they may never face a personal injustice which is more likely to cause a 'shit, the world is not just' realisation than seeing an injustice happening to someone they don't know or care about. And they're the ones with the power to enforce their flawed ideology. So I'm maybe 97% depressed about the situation.

I charge £50 an hour to repair PCs.

Most people don't want to pay me to spend hours messing about, jumping through hoops and making an unnecessary point of covering my eyes when I can just double-click in *My Documents* and see ""yeah, that looks ok"".

That's because most people don't have illegal incriminating data on their computers.

Yes, there's times when I'll run `md5deep` and then a `diff`, but there are plenty of times when the quickest, easiest thing to do is open a program or a folder and see if works.

I'm ethical and I'm a professional - I don't go looking for or through my customer's private data, but if they say ""Outlook's not working"" then I'm going to see the subject lines of their emails, and probably the first paragraph of one or two, also.

What being ethical and professional means, as a computer repairman, is that  I don't acknowledge my customers' private files by saying ""oh, you were looking good in your bikini pics"" or go gossiping about it to my mum or yours, ""oh, blimey, the Smiths are in a swingers club, I saw it in their inbox"".

If I'm looking for a jpeg to make sure Image Viewer is working, then I stop and look for one somewhere else, should I stumble upon your porn stash.

Let me emphasise clearly: when someone tells me there's something wrong with their computer, we'll sit down at it and they'll show me what they do to access the program or file(s). It is simply not possible to translate ""my email's not working; oh, I don't know what program I use, it's the one with the gold icon"" and fix some obscure error message without seeing it for yourself.

As a technician I simply can't fix problems by moving .dll's around with a pair of tweezers - I *have* to sit at the computer and use it the same way the owner would. That means I see the files on their desktop. When they ask me to set up their phone or digital camera to transfer photos to their computer, I cannot possibly avoid seeing those photos. 

&gt; if they don't value their customers privacy.

That's like saying a gynaecologist doesn't value their patients' privacy - sure, you might be able to blind-guess accurately with a CAT scan and a dozen blood tests, but the whole point of the job is to take a look at the symptoms.

Right now, for two summers running, Utd haven't been able to sign their targets not because of money but because of the draw. Last year it was because Moyes came in and people weren't sure how that would go. This year it's because they're out of CL and Van Gaal, for all his status, is not a guarantee that they'll just slot back into the title race. He is, almost certainly, a draw unto himself though. 

My definition for a big club might be rather narrow but I think you bringing up the Yankees is actually a perfect example. The Yankees are the biggest draw in baseball. Losing Joe Torre might have made them seem less stable but it didn't change the chance a player would join them. For United it clearly did.

If Arsene Wenger left Arsenal and wasn't replaced by a coach that was already a drawn unto himself would Arsenal lose some of its allure? Almost certainly. But Arsenal and Chelsea are also clubs that benefit from their location.

The 4-3-3 intrigues me this season. If we adopt an ever so slightly more defensive lineup e.g. Gerrard, Hendeson and Allen/Can as the midfield 3 then who will play in the front 3? Sturridge and Sterling will surely play 90% of the time but that 3rd spot is up for grabs. Remy, Coutinho, Lallana, Markovic, Lambert, etc will all be able to take that spot. 

Coutinho used to play as a winger though we've found he does his best work in the #10 position. Lallana can start there but will usually drift inside. Remy is good on the left cutting in down that inside left channel on his strong foot.

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"But that shouldn't be the way it is.

Our supporters haven't suddenly become higher earners overnight after we won the title.

It's a false argument, as I mentioned previously, because football clubs aren't strictly a commercial enterprise, i.e better product = higher cost. 

That isn't football.

Football clubs are a social institute. They represent their local area, and their supporters support them through thick and thin, the success of the side is an irrelevance to the core support.

That loyalty kept this club afloat in those leaner years, without it, we wouldn't have the City we have today.

That loyalty should count for something.

But it doesn't, it counts for shit in the eyes of the club. Which is contrary to what we were told initially after the takeover.

What the club suits now see is merely supply and demand. They see we're a successful club and that there are new fans who want to be part of it. They know that even if much of the core supporters are priced out, there will be new fans to take their place.

That's all they care about - money. Clearly.

If that wasn't the case then the loyalty I'd mentioned previously would count for something, but it doesn't.

The cost to the club will be dear, because everything that made this club special was the fans. That's what separated us from other clubs.

As it is, our match going fanbase will soon be the like for like generic top flight club, dare I say it but even like Old Trafford.

Local long serving supporters disillusioned and priced out from watching their club live, and reduced to watching games in their local pubs for free. While new fans with little passion for the club and the football tourists who clamour for tickets to watch the big clubs fill their void.

What's left is a sanitised corporate shell with smatterings of the core support left over.

We're going down that road now, and once we've passed a certain point there's no reversing it. The effects on a fanbase are irreversible.

That is what I fear most, the day when I go to a match and nothing I see resembles the Manchester City I know: the day there isn't the shared dry humour and witty wise cracks among the terraces, the day the seasoncard holders I've know for 10 years around me and shake hands with at every match day are no longer there. The self depreciating chants and City character of the match crowd. The atmosphere - which is getting worse and worse year on year.

Should all these thing change and I be sat next to and flanked on all sides by the caricature type of someone from Somerset who started supporting us in 2012 for example, brings a digital camera with him every game, doesn't understand the club or its culture, and all while sitting in a silent and sanitised stadium... Then that wouldn't be City for me.

It wouldn't matter how successful we were, that would hugely detract from what makes this club special for me. It would be utterly divorced from the City I know.

And in such circumstances I'd be tempted to watch home games in the pub with other blues who were priced out/disillusioned, and do away games with the core support.

City have to get this right, because if they continue going down this path they'll tear the heart out of this club.

We all would've liked some success prior to 2008, but not at any cost.

Success at any cost is not what we wanted. You don't need to sell your soul to be a success.",0,1405975667,null,0,false,0,cj3rg9a,t3_2badm6,t1_cj3rg9a,t1_cj3mjgr,null,1434827095,4,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,4

---

&gt;The Pike Place Fish Market is best known for their habit of hurling customers' orders across the shopping area. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish, with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order, which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter for wrapping.  Initially, the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee, but was enjoyed by customers, so it became a tradition.  While working, the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish.  At times, the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss.  Above the areas in which they throw fish, the market hangs a sign that reads, ""Caution: Low Flying Fish"".

 Typically with the brokers I know, you speak to the advisor and go through what product (type of loan and rate etc) would be best suited to your needs and affordability. Once you've gone through that you pick the lender that appears most attractive.

 Once you've identified which lender is the best possibility for you to be successful with you'll begin the application; formally submitting your details, income and property details etc. The decision in principle (or mortgage in principle) is accepted or declined here. It doesn't often get declined unless the lender finds that you don't meet their requirements.


 Once it's accepted, you continue with the application and go through the steps/information that I have tried to provide some sort of guidance to here. You'll have a decision in principle or DIP right up until you receive a ""Mortgage Offer"" - at this point the lender has decided that they are happy with all your income and the value of the property etc and are happy to lend you the amount you've applied for! Then you can continue towards exchange and completion on a property with the solicitor's (often referred to as conveyancers during buying a property) guidance.

The journalist Fintan O'Toole argues that ""both militarily and ideologically, the Army was a player, not a referee"".[9] [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Banner#Controversies)",0,1405976845,null,0,1405977207,0,cj3s5li,t3_2bapn7,t1_cj3s5li,t1_cj3iw07,null,1434827566,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

one of my best football watching friends supports arsenal. He HATES liverpool fans. Like HATES them irrationally. He turns on me any time football comes up.

Now I don't HATE any football fans, and that's just a rule for me. But I do hate my friends being fucking shitty about my team when I make genuine efforts not to be shitty about theirs when times are tough. 

The media portrays us Football fans as: fickle, manipulative, argumentative, ""desperate for success psychopaths"" when the heat of an argument is up, and for some reason we seem to feel the need to want to live up to that. 

My advice would be don't sweat it! Know everything they are going to throw at you, and just keep calm because they're the ones with their panties in a twist, not you... and i know it's tough sometimes because they're your mates but if the argument gets too intense at any point, one or both or all of you need to think a wee bit about your priorities...

true,196884,null,null,"Coutinho's is not clinical enough to be #10 (that's his one big drawback). 

But, he is our best #8 right now. He needs to stop thinking how to overtake Neymar, instead he should embrace his inner Iniesta. 

His best position is left side of a 442 diamond, where we have an overload in the center so that he has time to pick his pass and do his magic. This is the position he plays in the two friendlies so far.

In a 4-2-3-1, which is looking like what BR is going to employ next season, he can play in any of the ""3"". Where he plays depends on what BR wants to do and/if Sterling/Lazar is playing. If the opposition's defense has pace issues or is a high line (or, ideally, both  like Arsenal), then sterling/lazar goes down the middle as the #10, and Cou might find himself shuffled to either flanks (more likely, he might be benched). If the opposition's defense is going to park bus, then BR will overload the wide areas with sterling (to exploit the wide areas that opens up when teams park the bus), and Cou will be playing #10. 

In a 4-3-3, he will probably play on the left side of the front 3. This is probably his weakest position/formation, since he is not a naturally wide player. 

In short, where Coutinho plays will depend on the formation/opposition. I am very excited about how BR is going to solve the ""Coutinho"" problem if, as I suspect, he will have a break-out year. (Yes I am a total Coutinho-fan-boi, but for very good reason. He, together with Sterling, is our best player with the highest potential ceiling bar Suarez.)

true,tnjhawks,null,null,"Qualifications or abilities? My objection is that we haven't really seen a lot of Sahko.  Certainly not enough to qualify him as a vocal leader or a well qualified captain. It bugs me because people love on Sakho and hate on Agger.  As soon as Sakho takes the starting spot and holds it then we can start arguing about how great he is.  But he hasn't done that yet. He hasn't taken it from Agger or from Skrtel. 

I think this sub assumes a lot about our team and never really backs it up.  We think Agger needs to be sold and Sahko is much better.  But when it came down to it last year, Sahko was playing when Agger was injured.  When Agger was good he was largely starting over Sahko.  Our pair that got the most playing time was Skrtel and Agger.  

If we're going by this logic why aren't we arguing for Lallana to be our captain? Why not Kolo Toure?  They're both leaders, they're both very qualified.  The answer is because they haven't been on the team for long enough.  They haven't had a change to develop a chemistry with the team nor have the clout to be in that leadership position.

&gt; “It was actually Zinedine Zidane. He was my favourite player and I used to watch him every weekend”

&gt; [laughs] ""Yeah, I think I’d give him a run for his money!""

Q. Did you always play as a midfielder when you were growing up as a kid? 

&gt; “Yes. I had 1 season when I was playing at full-back when I was about 11 but otherwise I've always played in midfield” 

Q. Who is the best midfielder you have played with and against? 

&gt; “With… is Stevie. I haven’t actually played against him so I can’t say him twice, so against probably Luka Modric” 

Q. Who is your best friend in the Liverpool squad? 

&gt; “Probably Glen Johnson” 

Q. Will you be spurred on by the competition for places next season? 

&gt; “Yes, you have to see it that way. Having competition in the team always brings out the best in players” 

Q. Are you looking forward to playing at Fenway Park? 

&gt; ""I missed the tour 2 years ago &amp; didn't get the chance to experience Fenway Park so I’m looking forward to it""

we didnt get our spot last season, only because of suarez, it was a team effort, our attack was doing so great, that suarez could have scored alot more goals, but he never needed too.

Fact of the matter is right now the other teams should be scared, we are gonna be so much in there face, regardless of loosing suarez, that i dont give a rats ass about the new big money signings they may or may not have made. As it looks now, only man city and chelsea even have a defence capable of handling our attack. If arsenal thinks bringing in sanchez and debuchy will suddently fix all there problems, and if Man U think they fix a entire team in a transfer window, well then i can only laugh. Truth of the matter is, when it comes to team building, we are miles ahead of our oponents, our team isnt just a team that can be stopped, the oposing team will be forced to faul our players if they wanna stop em. We are gonna get so many chances, that the goals will return, frankly our defence is gonna be alot better, last season everything was new and we had a injury problems defensively. In regards to Lallana i think you missed the point, we didnt buy him because he would change the world, he was bought because he was a english national player, whit a very high technical level.
Lallana is a very popular player, he along whit sturridge, henderson and sterling, will inspire alot of fans to join liverpool, and most likely alot of young english players will want to follow there footsteps, i think he was a incredible purchase, and im looking forward to seeing him on the pitch.

if we land lovren, moreno and origi, then we dont have to worry about anything, just ""Lean"" and let brendan do hes shit, and start singing YNWA, and then the players will handle the rest.

A leader needs to lead an entire country of people, and to do that they need to convince the nation that their way is the correct way. And you can't do that with spreadsheets.. You need to do it with the spoken word, and conviction. You need to connect with the electorate without ever meeting them. 

An intelligent person, with good ideas and zero charisma won't be able to do that. They might as well be a dunce.

Davies coming in and Siggy leaving makes sense, though I will be sad to see Thor go.  He's a talented boy and works hard; he's just a bit surplus.

Vorm, however, is a bit of a mystery.  I can see our need for a new 'keeper, assuming he is happy as back-up/cup 'keeper.  We've got a good history of rotating 'keepers in the cup competitions and Friedel is now too old and will be otherwise engaged at the club in a coaching and ambassadorial role. Ok.  Not totally sure why Swansea would want to sell, unless they have more faith in Tremmel than I do or have someone else lined up.  And I really don't understand why Vorm would want to move, especially as he is coming to his peak; why does he want to warm a bench?  Weird.

This can be seen from their inspection manual:

The specific description in the inspection guidelines are ""Inspection item 8 refers to PHV only, as set out in the London PHV Act 1998,, in that the vehicle must not display signage with the word taxi, be equipped with taximeter equipment and/or lamp boxes"" with the method of inspection being ""The vehicle is not of such design that it could lead any person to believe it was a London cab.""

The black cabs are arguing that the legislation as written prohibits any device for charging based on measuring distance and time and not just ones that could cause someone to confuse a blackcab and minicab.

No-one has challenged other methods of charging by time/distance (map, lookup tables, watch) and it's been generally accepted that they're allowed.

Men receive stiffer sentences *for the same crimes*. This is even observable when factors such as criminal background are accounted for.

&gt; experienced judges, lay assessors, prosecutors, police officers, and lawyers make decisions and convict defendants differently depending on whether they are men or women

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002

&gt; We …find that women receive prison sentences that average a little over 2 years less than those awarded to men. Even after controlling for circumstances such as the severity of the offense and past criminal history, women receive more lenient sentences.

&gt; There is compelling evidence of gender disparity in sentencing. [...] There is also evidence that these differences, which do not disappear when crime seriousness, prior criminal record, and other legally relevant factors are taken into consideration, reflect discrimination in favor of women.

If anything that's my core point. Following any one of the more extreme atrocities (e.g. Brighton) the UK could have easily stormed into N.

Over time they could limit building materials and food into the region to put them on a ""diet"" &amp; prevent people from taking jobs in the next district because of the 2 hour transit time. Maybe arbitrarily keep shrinking their fishing zones while harassing the sailors who do sail the seas.

I'm pretty confident that had we done all that and maintained it for about 30-40 years we'd be in the same situation as Israel.

I don't think we'll get Lovren btw, just letting you know that Jose has publicly stated he wants two players per position so don't count on Zouma being our only backup CB. Whether we sign a player or give a youngster an opportunity, IDK. I'm surprised Kalas was loaned out tbh but we also have Chalobah(albeit he looks a lot more like a midfielder these days, he was a CB and has played CB in both pre-season games) and Christensen. 

Considering we went through most of last season with only 3 CBs (not including the odd appearance from Kalas) a 4th CB won't need to be anything special because he will more than likely only be used in cup games or in dire situations. Using some of the players I mentioned would also correlate with Jose's recent statement that he would give 3 or 4 youngsters a chance to come through.

true,objectobject,lfc68,,"We have so many players deserving of just being in the match day 18 who won't make it. Can't even pick a strongest 18 never mind 11.

Suso and Ibe have more than given reason these last two games as to why they have a place in our squad rather than shipped out on loan. But on top of them we have Sterling, Markovic and Lallana vying for a wide position either side of the striker. Sterling, Suso, Lallana and Coutinho win out a little more as they are capable of playing at the #10 too.

In central midfield/defensive midfield it has talent which seems on equal level. Gerrard and Hendo you would think win out but we don't know how well Can will play. Plus if we play 3 in central midfield as we may sometimes (I expect Rodgers will continue with ever changing formations which worked well last season to surprise the opposition) it will throw up the problem of who out of Can, Allen and Lucas join Hendo and Gerrard. Or perhaps even Lallana or Coutinho dropping back as they are capable.

If we play two strikers then who wins out of Borini, Remy and Lambert of who joins Sturridge? One would think Lambert because of his experience but at the same time Remy had more goals last season.

It is much simpler with the defence mind. Just a matter of who is the best RB, Johnson or Flanno. LB, Moreno or Enrique. RCB, Skrtel or Lovren. LCB, Agger or Sakho.

The good thing is the fact that we can have these debates shows just how far we've come in such a short space of time regarding the strength in depth. Last season the closest we got was when we had to choose over whether Coutinho, Allen or Sterling played. It actually rather helped to have one of those on the bench too (Southampton away being the best example). Think about how much more pep our team can have when we can introduce a Suso, a Lambert or a Markovic from the bench EVERY WEEK.

Our first XI is perhaps a little weaker now we have gotten rid of Suarez and it is hard to produce a definitive strongest XI but our bench is five times as strong as last season (and I am certain the bench will produce five times as many goals and assists).",0,1405987183,null,0,false,0,cj3xhsa,t3_2bcdpo,t1_cj3xhsa,t3_2bcdpo,null,1434829830,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

The club can't just keep treading water for years and years while the stadium happens... building the ""brand"" worldwide is as important as filling a stadium, which is something Utd and Liverpool learned a long time ago.  Exciting, attacking football, developing superstars of tomorrow, and a solid core team is what will propel us forward.

Again, I'm not advocating a huge transfer outlay (I seem to be one of the only people here not in favour of dropping $25 mil on Griezmann), but we can't realistically look to finish anything above 6th or 7th with our current squad, with glaring holes in CB, LB and attack.  Plugging a few of those holes with relatively cheap players like Davies, Vlaar and Valbuena/Depay can make the difference between us sustaining a top four challenge and finishing comfortably mid-table.
