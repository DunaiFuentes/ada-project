true,dollyknot,uk,Leicestershire,"Many people have the absurd idea that human beings created order, a classic example is [Archbishop James Usher]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ussher) his eminence believed and taught that the world was created, on the 23 October 4004 BC.

Because of the humble road that science takes, in trying to establish what the true reality is, people started to realise that Usher was talking arrogant rubbish, when the evidence given by things like ocean fossils being found at the top of mountains, suggested that time was far far older.

Many people look at religion in a dichotomous sense, as though they have the almost miraculous ability, to sum up  the entire universe life and everything with a simple yes or no, encapsulated in the question, do you believe in God, yes or no?

For many years I considered myself an agnostic, in that I could not answer such questions, then I learned from such thinkers as Spinoza, he came from a strict Jewish background and what he said, earned him excommunication, death threats and an attack on his life.
Spinoza came from a culture that believed 'God created the universe' Spinoza was alive in the era of Galileo and Copernicus when the scientific revolutions happened, what upset Spinoza's people so much was, his philosophical work, stated that, God did not create universe, God is the universe and his language is science.

The biggest evidence for some kind of order that I know of, apart from the periodic table, is the natural calendar, the moon goes around the earth 13 times in a year, this leads to all kinds of natural cycles, like the spring tides for instance, trees putting out their leaves, some mammals coming out of hibernation, migrating salmon, the list seems near endless.

In our human arrogance, we pretend that there is only 12 months in a year. 

The reason for today's post is, if we had a rational solar calendar of 13 months of 28 days each, today would be the last day of January and tomorrow would be the first day of February.

When I lived in the South-East (and from my experience of tutoring for kids looking to getting into various private schools, albeit in the north-east/Scotland), I cannot over-emphasize the sheer size of the private tutoring industry that got people into the remaining grammar schools and the 11+/common entrance exams. Moreover the stuff people do to get their kids into the local 'good' school (being religious, driving up prices in the cachment area, etc). This solution is a sticking plaster that attacks the symptoms not the cause (Seldon is a windbag who likes his name in the paper). As long as there is 'the shit' school then people are going to do anything to get their kids away from them. I honestly think looking at streaming, offering vocational courses a lot earlier, would be a lot better. 
 
I'm all for a certain % of private school places being free though like Seldon has suggested. Private schools have a huge turnover each year, which they then invest in facilities because they have to, but fees have rapidly increased in the last few years (along with targeting the international market) and this has meant the advantages in facilities and teaching at the private schools has become almost completely unassailable. They have the money to provide it.

&gt;Yet modern ""atheism"" is predicated on a position that there are no gods. Which is a belief, a view, a perspective, an argument, a position. It's all of those things. If it was simpky a lack of belief then you wouldn't care about Gods.
Modern Atheists do indeed believe that there are no Gods, to deny that is weaselly, sneaky word play. The truth in reality is you don't believe in Gods because you believe Gods dont exist. So Im asking you for evidence to back up that position.

This *is not* an argument. You cannot provide evidence to show that god does not exist. It is not physically possible to do. You could, however, provide evidence that god does exist - it's just that no one has managed to do it yet, except for arguments that The Bible is a holy book, or that the Quran is the word of god himself. The atheist position is quite simple and very scientific, it is simply that you do not believe in things for which there is not evidence. If evidence were provided, then atheists would believe in gods.

&gt;If it was simpky a lack of belief then you wouldn't care about Gods.

I don't care about gods! I only care about how other humans treat each other.

&gt;Reducing religious belief to the tooth fairy ignores the fact that belief in Gods has been endemic to the human condition throughout history.

This is an appeal to tradition and an appeal to majority. It is not an argument. The fact that belief in Gods has been endemic to 'the human condition' means nothing. Humans previously believed in Hades, animal sacrifice, miasmas, witches, that the earth was flat, that the sun orbited the earth, etc etc. Reducing religious belief to the tooth fairy is actually quite reasonable - they are both concepts for which there is no physical evidence. If atheists have to prove that god does not exist, so religious people must prove that the tooth fairy does not exist. 

Oh, and another thing - which god are atheists supposed to prove does not exist? As has been said before, Christians and atheists are very much alike, it's just that atheists believe in one less god.

&gt;Your view is no more valid than anyone elses without proof.

Are you aware of the concept of the null-hypothesis?

*A type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that no statistical significance exists in a set of given observations. The null hypothesis attempts to show that no variation exists between variables, or that a single variable is no different than zero. It is presumed to be true until statistical evidence nullifies it for an alternative hypothesis.*

In other words, the burden of proof lies in the party that sets itself against the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is not Christianity, Islam or Wicca. Perfectly logical, right? So if the null hypothesis is that god doesn't exist, why would we want to live in a society that gives special virtues to those that believe he does?

&gt;Fake oppression isnt really that impressive. You arent being oppressed, the victim card isnt working. In the UK you get the same rights as everyone else and your rights to freedom of thought is protected legally.

No, no I don't, and that is a fact. There are religious people sitting on the House of Lords for no other reason than that they believe in Christianity. You haven't even managed to refute that argument, you just keep ignoring it because it suits you to say that I'm not being oppressed by it. We don't all have the same rights. 

&gt;Reality sucks.

Reality doesn't suck, it's people that can't get to grips with it that suck. 

My advice to you would be to learn how to argue before engaging in a subject like this. Otherwise people will just tear you apart. And stop appealing to tradition and majority.",0,1390128469,null,0,1390128687,0,cetbuzm,t3_1vivlq,t1_cetbuzm,t1_cet2kch,null,1435526444,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Q: Are City going for anybody in January?
A: No
Q: Why's that?
A: We don't expect the players that we're after to be available. Don't expect us to splash the cash as much as in the past because of FFP. Plus we want to grow our own
Q: Who are we after?
A: Mangala

I've been a City fan for a very long time but I'm one of those guys who will openly admit that they still don't know much about football.

So I feel uncomfortable that we seem to be arguing

The proof of whether City are going for a left back in January is when we've actually signed one. When I had my conversation, none of the trouble at Southampton had flared up. So perhaps Shaw, who is probably on some long list somewhere, has come to the fore.

If we accept that premise, then from the referee's angle, there's only ever going to be one decision.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"How in the hell did you arrive at me having resentment for my tenants? First, I haven't had a tenant for over a decade, as I moved back into the property. Second, I hardly mentioned tenants in my post.

I will point out, for those who think that all landlords are mercenary bastards who are getting something for free, that tenants do represent a considerable risk, as I found out with my very first one. Without boring you with the details, I received £1,500 from her in rent for the 3 months she stayed there, and I paid out £3,000 in various repairs and removals of her property. I also subsequently discovered that she hadn't paid gas, electricity or council tax during her 3 months tenancy.

But that's okay, because according to some fuckwits around here, landlords get a 'free' house out of it. The reality is more complicated. It is a business. It is an investment. It comes with risks and rewards. But it is certainly not 'screwing someone over to get a free house'.

And no, it is *not* bullshit about them not having to pay for things like the new kitchen. You try renting out a flat without a fucking kitchen (or a fucking lavatory) and see how far you get.  The rental market stands a SMALL premium for furnished accommodation, but believe me, the market dictates the rental price. 

And even though a tenant *is* paying that small (usually very small) premium for furnishings, they have the substantial advantage of not having that big cost outlay to buy furniture when they move. Or the expense of removals for their own furniture.

Jesus, I rented myself for ten years, do I really fucking have to explain the advantages of rental over buying? Or do the Marxist fuckwits around here still live with mummy and daddy and have no experience of the subject?

There are exceptions, but never be foolish enough to think you can slap whatever price you want on your property. That means your expenses are factored in to your margins, you can't take a £500 a month property and whack another £300 on it just because you stuck in some new kitchen units.

And neither was I suggesting I was doing a tenant a 'favour' by subsidising their rent. Just pointing out to those fucking imbeciles that property rental is a long term enterprise that very often costs considerable amounts of money up front, and only gradually, over the course of time, gives returns.

I'd certainly never employ you to run a business.

PS: I *do* resent that particular tenant I just mentioned, yes.

So, they have to buy talented and established players almost exclusively because they can't afford to take chances on youngsters when their jobs are on the line. 

But with a manager who has a chance to really build his own team and has some confidence in his job security, academy players and youth prospects might get more looks. Hopefully, anyways.

I think the skills shortage notion is actually one that allows employers to shift the burden of training onto the employee, and it doesn't accurately reflect the standard of applicants. I say this because it's much easier to justify stagnating wages when people are forever ""unqualified"" for the job yet at the same time the number of graduates falling is only a very recent thing. There seems to be a trend that's established meaning we, the employees, take on more burden for training at higher costs. I'm not trying to make out like it's a conspiracy but this has been happening. The only way I see this being affected by immigration is that immigrants are willing to take on menial jobs for less money because locals want jobs that pay more, probably to offset the costs of getting qualified in the first place.

It's become an employer's market but I don't think immigration makes it worse off for anyone who isn't applying for menial jobs.

&gt;Why is one belief more absurd than the other?

Because one is not supported by evidence. Meteorologists can present models and fluid dynamics to support their explanation for bad weather, without requiring the concept of a god.

And the meteorological science is falsifiable: if it were completely wrong, the models would not have predicted it. They *are* probabilistic models, and become more uncertain the further ahead you forecast, but short range forecasts are fairly accurate.

If what you're saying is correct then immigrants and natives aren't in competition with each other - they're occupying completely different areas of the market. Immigrants are doing unskilled work for minimum wage whereas natives who are qualified are seeking higher paid work as a consequence of them spending time/money getting those qualifications.

You'll really struggle to get anywhere for sub £400 if you're wanting your own flat, if you're sharing you will probably be able to get a room for around that depending on area, I stay in a large flat just off Morrison Road with one other person and I pay £375, however bills take that up to £500 but it's a premium location, outside of main centre you'd be less. I stayed in Sighthill about 8 years ago in a HMO and it was £300pm bills included. I shared with a mate in Orwell place in Dalry and it was @ £400 including bills. 

I can only really speak about the west end of Edinburgh but Gorgie/Dalry are not bad places to stay, loads of local shops,takeaways and excellent bus routes, not exactly up-market but decent enough. I'd personally not want to stay any further outside the centre that there but it depends on circumstances really 

www.citylets.co.uk are a decent source for looking for flats

This will vary from person to person but in my  (vast!) experience of renting in Edinburgh a private landlord is better than an agency. I've never once had my full deposit back from an agency (think I've had about 8) yet only once have I not had it back form a private landlord and that was agreed in advance because I accidentally put a hole in the wall a few days before moving out. If for whatever reason you're late with a payment as I've been on occasion you don't end up with stupid charges. Also the initial down lay of money is often quite a bit less as private landlord will generally just charge you months rent plus months deposit (and some you can even negotiate that)whereas agencies normally bit you will all sorts of stupid charges on top

The in game management was low because he made the subs way too late and didn't change around the formation for a while in the first half as well.

Some are, some aren't, they're all humans. What's your point?

&gt;Yes the Bishops in the house of lords is silly as I have consistently stated throughout this thread, but so are hereditary peers

I've not seen any atheists arguing that hereditary peers aren't stupid. But if there are some, I'm sure they're not arguing it through their atheist beliefs. 

&gt;I also stated that the bishops don't seem to have had enough influence to hold back the path of progress, much of which comes from our membership in the European Union.

Does that make it OK then?

&gt;Feel free to write to your MP or form a lobby group if it bothers you so much.

It does bother me. If I thought writing to my MP would do any good, I would. I fully support any lobby group arguing for equal rights, and have done so in the past (e.g. on gay marriage). I'm not too sure what that has to do with this debate, however - all we're saying is 'is it right or wrong?'.

true,hmm_iwonder,null,null,"Not necessarily. There are a lot of people, especially young people e.g., NEETs, who are also in competition with immigrants for jobs. What I am trying to say is that (most) immigrants target a very specific part of the job market, and the overlap isn't that large when you compare it to natives. I think Charlie Brooker says this much better than I can in his show but in essence, he said that you don't see surgeons getting up in arms about the number of immigrants coming into the country, and there's a reason for that.

&gt; The reason jobs require more qualifications now is because they are more technical than they were before (more use of technology for example) and because more people are staying in education longer and thus employers' expectations have risen accordingly.

It's not so much the reason I'm arguing, but the effects.... If we're expected to train ourselves and receive little to no help from employers, it's a bit of a slap in the face when they claim that there's a skills shortage. For example, how many entry level IT job adverts ask for people versed in many programming languages and with years of experience that isn't really realistic giving the (expected) age of the applicant.

&gt; This has nothing to do with immigration but a changing economy and education system.

This is what I'm trying to get at. Immigrants who come to the UK aren't going for jobs that require copious amounts of training and qualifications because most of the time, they simply don't have them. But I have to disagree that this is completely separate to issue to minimum wage, I don't think it is.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"IN ITS 19th-century heyday Liverpool was one of Britain’s richest cities. Its professionals were so prosperous that they paid more in income tax than those of Birmingham, Leeds and Sheffield put together. But, one by one, the city’s upper-middle-class institutions are tumbling.

Since 2007 five fee-paying schools in Merseyside have converted to state-funded academies, or announced their intention to do so—including the prestigious Liverpool College. Lewis’s, a once-glamorous department store, closed in 2010. In December 2013 the Liverpool Post, a local paper dating from 1855, published its final issue. Carrying a mix of politics, sport and serious business news for the middle classes, it no longer sold enough copies or carried enough advertisements to survive.

Liverpool had a comparatively mild economic slump. In gross-value-added terms, its economy has tumbled 5.8% since 2007, compared with an average fall of 7.4% across Britain. The proportion of its workforce on unemployment benefit peaked at 7%—far below the appalling rates of over 20% in the 1980s.

Yet the city’s higher earners have been squeezed. Liverpool’s unemployment rate has stayed subdued because the number of low-paying jobs has grown. But the public sector, which provided many of the city’s well-paid jobs before the recession, has been hit hard by austerity. And between 2008 and 2011 the city’s finance industry shrank by a third; Manchester’s contracted by just 11%. The takeover of Royal Liver Assurance, the city’s biggest insurance firm, by a London-based outfit in 2011 was a bitter blow.

Incomes are falling behind prices. The average weekly wage in Liverpool rose by just 3.7% between 2008 and 2012, while retail prices increased by 13%. The cost of some things bought by wealthier households rose more. Private-school fees—which make up a large chunk of many upper-middle-class budgets—shot up by 18.3%. The spending power of a typical Liverpool private-school parent will not return to its pre-recession level before 2018, according to MTMConsulting, a market-research firm. Even though five fee-paying schools are becoming state schools, applications to study at the remaining private schools are falling.

In some ways affluent Merseysiders are trading down. In the car park of an Aldi discount supermarket in Kirkdale, regular shoppers note the growth in “posh” cars like Range Rovers—a trend seen in other straitened parts of Britain. But aspirations have remained intact. Liverpool College’s principal, Hans van Mourik Broekman, says many parents who visit the now-free school are the sort who would have been able to afford fees in the past but can no longer do so.

A middle-class revival is possible. White-collar jobs have started to return to central Liverpool as firms are drawn by cheap office rents, often for space left empty by former public-sector tenants. More young people are sticking around, partly for lack of enticing opportunities elsewhere. A tenth more Liverpool University graduates now remain in the city to work compared with 2010, according to Paul Redmond at the university’s careers service. The total population of central Liverpool grew by 3.3% between 2008 and 2012 while middle-class suburbs like Sefton contracted slightly.

Before the city’s docks were redeveloped, a historian called Liverpool’s grand, then-derelict centre “an unwanted mausoleum” of its economic heyday. That is no longer the case. It is now the well-to-do suburbs that feel rather tired.",0,1390134205,null,0,false,0,cetcn9r,t3_1vl7a2,t1_cetcn9r,t1_cetcl4a,null,1432008502,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

&gt; But had you done a bit more research and followed the link to the original post, you would have understood there has been a campaign around for many years, for a more rational calendar here.

What people are worried about is that in a situation where, presently, there's a fair benefit to setting up in the UK, firms will instead look to EU states instead. 

We manage regulatory filings for companies in the EMEA region. The fact that the EU has drop-in rules that, other than language, operate almost universally across the single market is incredibly useless for firms, as they know what the conditions on the ground are, and they know that Member States will conform to those rules over time. 

If the UK leaves the EU, it'll either remain in the EEA, in which case we'd still have to obey the majority of EU rules without any input in them, or we'd have some sort of selective system, which would raise regulatory risk (i.e., the fear that the UK will just decide to disapply a business sensitive regulation).

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"'As 30% owner of UK fracker Cuadrilla, and with a seat in the heart of government, Lord John Browne is the UK’s fracking Czar.

Indeed, John Browne is an extraordinarily powerful man. Notorious for his involvement in raising student tuition fees and as a twelve-year head of controversial oil company BP, Browne is now an unelected part of the Cabinet Office, right in the centre of government decision making.

The peer’s influence comes from the many jobs he has created during his time in the corridors of power. The people appointed to these jobs have one thing in common: they owe their position to Browne.

To understand his role it’s necessary to go back to June 2010 when Francis Maude, MP for Horsham (a constituency including the fracking site at Balcombe), appointed him to the Cabinet office. A government press release stated: “one of his first tasks (was) to appoint Non-Executive Directors to the board of each government department”.

This job has become a key plank in Browne’s power. It gives him the ability to appoint large numbers of people into key government positions. Each appointee sits alongside Ministers of State, Under Secretaries of State, Permanent Secretaries, Chief Operating Officers and Director Generals as they make the decisions which govern the country.

Hence today we find four Browne appointees at the treasury, the government’s most powerful department. 

Three more are found at DECC, which grants oil and gas licenses and oversees the industry.

At  DEFRA, which oversees the Environment Agency, Browne has overseeen the appointment of four non-executives.

There are many more government departments – and many more Browne appointees.

This new culture of non-executive directors extends deep inside the government machine. That’s because each government depertments oversees agencies, projects, national authorities and regulators: all of which are busy appointing non-executive directors.

As such there are hundreds of people within government departments who owe their jobs to one man: Lord Browne.

Outside government, the web of Browne’s influence spreads through the commercial world. As well as being the managing director at Riverstone LLC  (through which he owns part of Cuadrilla) he’s a director at CODA Automotive Inc (car batteries) and Cuadrilla Resources Holdings Ltd. He sits on seven advisory boards, including that of fracking Services group Schlumberger, two financial services groups and two oil and gas groups.

He’s previously been Non-Executive Director at Apax (another private equity group), Daimler Chrysler, Intel and Smithkline Beecham.
That’s not to mention he was CEO of BP for twelve years, one of the world’s largest companies.

&gt; the WCA is a norm-referenced system. People must both score the number of points required for benefit receipt and fall within the proportion of people the norms system will allow to receive the benefit. In practice this means there is a finite number of claimants the assessment system will allow to be awarded the benefit, regardless of the number of people who objectively meet the criteria for benefit eligibility.

&gt; Evidence shows that Atos uses a ‘management information tool’,  based on the ‘statistical norms’, to ‘manage’  the behaviour of individual assessors. Although officially the audit of assessments is not supposed to be punitive, it’s clear from whistle-blowers that in many regions there are negative consequences for assessors if they do not restrict the number of points they award to claimants to comply with the norms. This makes it difficult, for example, for them to award a high point score to every claimant who, in their clinical judgement, has a serious condition affecting their ability to work.

As long as they both have the same chances, and their wealth may be more or less between them, but ultimately that does not impact their livelihood in massive ways (i.e one can have a bigger house, but both live comfortably) then I don't see why that is something that needs to be feared?

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"&gt;Not necessarily. There are a lot of people, especially young people e.g., NEETs, who are also in competition with immigrants for jobs. What I am trying to say is that (most) immigrants target a very specific part of the job market, and the overlap isn't that large when you compare it to natives. I think Charlie Brooker says this much better than I can in his show but in essence, he said that you don't see surgeons getting up in arms about the number of immigrants coming into the country, and there's a reason for that.

Exactly, there is a small overlap and even when that overlap exists immigrants can only apply for the job, they are not given it. The only reason an employer would choose the immigrant over the native is if the immigrant is likely to be more productive than the native in the role. In most cases, the immigrant isn't even applying for the same role.

&gt;It's not so much the reason I'm arguing, but the effects.... If we're expected to train ourselves and receive little to no help from employers, it's a bit of a slap in the face when they claim that there's a skills shortage. For example, how many entry level IT job adverts ask for people versed in many programming languages and with years of experience that isn't really realistic giving the (expected) age of the applicant.

There's plenty of employers who pay thousands of pounds to train employees who have been brought in at a lower level but there's also plenty of companies which are expanding in a certain department and need experienced people to come in and be able to do the job straight away. Often they simply don't have the time or expertise to train the people up as the project will already be finished. This has nothing to do with immigration.

&gt;This is what I'm trying to get at. Immigrants who come to the UK aren't going for jobs that require copious amounts of training and qualifications because most of the time, they simply don't have them. But I have to disagree that this is completely separate to issue to minimum wage, I don't think it is. I think the issues are connected but not to a large extent simply because of the scope of the issue i.e., the specific part of the job market that is affected.

You might think the issues are connected but you haven't shown how this is true, unsurprisingly when it comes to immigration and unemployment most people find it difficult to justify the link because when you look at it in detail, the argument breaks down.",0,1390135298,null,0,false,0,cetcsrb,t3_1vih8c,t1_cetcsrb,t1_cetcm3v,null,1432008544,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;

&gt;A **mandolin** (Italian: mandolino) is a musical instrument in the lute family (plucked, or strummed) usually with four courses of strings, which are tuned in perfect fifths while the strings in a course are tuned in unison, and plucked with a plectrum. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. It descends from the mandore.

&gt;There are many styles of mandolin, but three are common, the Neapolitan (bowl-backed) mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-top mandolin. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-top mandolin is similar to a guitar, using thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music. Carved-top instruments are co ...

On top of that, David Moyes has never won away from home to one of the Premier League's traditional big four - Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal - a run of 47 games which has brought 18 points and 29 defeats.

true,osakanone,null,null,"You forget: Religion is also used as a tool to motivate people to fight for their country by creating a sense of cohesive identity and disregarding the potential to question those who lead them to battle. It also creates walls and for a long time was the defining factor in what established international boundaries and remains so today, preventing cultural osmosis between different countries and preventing us from achieving a true multicultural unified society that acts with the people's best interests in mind.

It was once your religious divine duty to go to war if your nation demanded it of you, to leave your family behind and fight, solidified on paper as a draft.

The crusades. The wars of catholocism and protestantism in England. Mary Queen of Scotts. Ireland, full stop. The Spanish genocide of south America, the English genocide of native Americans, Africa and the Zulus, Argentina, Haiti, the Philippines, the War of the Three Kingdoms, apathy causing the Great Irish Famine due to religious reasons...  They're all manifest destiny or religious apathy or intolerance born into conflict. 

Religion is also the greatest source of apathy on the planet: If you believe there's somewhere you're going to be after you die, you're not going to take care of the Earth because you've deluded yourself its just a waiting room for something better -- and its destroying our habitat, our environment. When its gone, the Earth won't be affected. The people will be gone but Earth will just start over as it always does.

It is also the greatest source of inappropriate guilt: abstinence is not natural human behaviour. People feel inherently guilty and refuse to explore and understand themselves as a result and shame those who do. This goes double for when the church began the witch trials and basically installed sexism and homophobia in western society. Contraception, abortion, health, population control, poverty, elitism, education and exclusion from education work and class, crime and punishment, institutionalised violence against women and children, the distribution of wealth (for the longest time, the church basically WAS the bank)...

Religion has a mind-boggling amount to account for. Its why in Uganda, India, Africa, people burn and stone to death LGBTs: The Church of England installed those sentiments in those countries and now acts like it has nothing to do with them. 200 years ago, they didn't give a shit.

Don't bullshit me that religious is harmless. It CAN be harmless but like any system for organising people, it can also be incredibly dangerous and since by its very design it has its roots in irrationality and intolerance of strikingly similar systems and a weird set of arbitrary laws that say certain kinds of people shouldn't be allowed to exist, it is VERY dangerous and holding us back as a species.",0,1390137220,null,0,false,0,cetd37w,t3_1vivlq,t1_cetd37w,t1_cetciz5,null,1432008681,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It has to hope that the US or one of the big European partners agrees with what it wants.

The era of big European partners is itself coming to an end. How we can hope to be the fourth most powerful nation in a world where China and India are surging is beyond me. 50 years from now Brazil could easily be a lot more powerful than us.

So the EU is the mechanism to preserve European culture, ideals and position in a world increasingly likely to swamp us. Britain, France and Germany might not be strong but the union could be.

When I was 20, I wanted to write the Great American Novel. But I ended up as a technical writer/editor instead. It was still fun, and I learned more than I ever wanted to know about gas chromatography and schistosomiasis and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. While I was writing other people's stuff, I was taking crappy part-time jobs and learning everything I could about the world I intended to write about one day.

At 30, I was married and had a kid, and I looked around for something I could do from home. So, I started constructing crossword puzzles. I still wrote things for other people, and edited other people's books, and managed to write a few books of my own. None of them turned out to be Great, or even great, but I had fun doing it, and I still get a few (teensy) royalty checks every year. 

Now, I'm 50, with two kids, and I'm still working at home, doing the puzzle thing, writing, editing...honestly, I'm living the dream. My commute is about ten seconds, and most days I work in my jammies because I'm an early bird and my family likes to sleep in. Clearly, it took me a while to figure out what I wanted to be...or grow up. 

My advice to you is to try everything. My experience as a short order cook taught me how to manage my time. My experience as a cocktail waitress taught me how to get along with difficult people (did it ever!). My experience in retail taught me how to sell things. My experience in a jazz band taught me to get over my fear of public speaking. My experience as a maintenance person taught me that people are pigs, but that the smallest thing (like replacing a light bulb) can make somebody's whole day. My experience as a teacher taught me that I fucking hate kids (except my own, they're practically perfect in every way), but that ""aha moment"" is totally worth the aggravation. Every single job I had taught me something useful, and most often the thing I learned was that I don't want to work in food service, or retail, or entertaining, or maintenance or education. Meanwhile, I learned how to manage my time, how to sell my writing, how to talk to people, and the most important thing of all: it only takes a few minutes to do something nice for someone or teach them a skill, and it's absolutely worth it to take those few minutes. 

And remember, there's no law that says you have to keep the same job for forty years. You can always quit and try something else. I don't know a single person who hasn't switched college majors or careers mid-stream. 

TL;DR Try everything; at the very least, you'll figure out what you _don't_ want to do. If you're lucky, you'll find something you like. Either way, life is about the journey, not the destination...get off your ass and do something.",0,1390140016,null,0,false,0,cetdl37,t3_1vdlzs,t1_cetdl37,t3_1vdlzs,null,1432008869,4,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,4

I moved to Germany about a month ago and so far I've been watching the games at pubs/sports bars, but I'm pretty sick at the moment and don't think I should go to one. Obviously I still want to watch the game though so I would like to stream it. However, I can't find much information on the legality of streaming it here. For peer to peer stuff you make a copy and upload so you almost certainly get a hefty fine. Streaming however is legal if you are doing so to avoid a geoblocker. I can't however find any information on streaming where you are not doing so from the rights holder. i.e. using a non, peer to peer stream from wiziwig etc. Would I be likely to get fined if I did?

If people who complain about the EU are genuinely worried about things like immigration or excess rules in the single market then the ONLY option is to leave entirely. The EFTA is a daft option that exists for countries that don't have the political will to commit in or out so they pretend to be out but actually are subject to every rule in the rulebook and have no vote in how the laws are made. Remember, votes on the European council are in proportion to population so if we gave up that vote and joined the EFTA we would be giving up the second largest number of votes in the union and the second largest amount of influence in the union (while complaining about how we've lost sovereignty to the EU) for no influence but the same system.

Words are twisted in this article and everybody knows that.

De Bruyne said Mourinho is a fantastic manager and thinks from himself he had always worked hard. He lost his joy in football when he didn't play matches, but he didn't blame Mourinho. 

I'm agreeing with people saying that he is a little bit of a whiner, but let's be honest and give the guy a rest. He's coming from a Belgian club, to one of the biggest in the world. Then he gets loaned out and hits very good form. Coming back to Chelsea didn't work out as planned. He's still young and ofcourse acting less professional when he doesn't get playing time.

Now with the WC coming up, I can understand De Bruyne's mindset. I think he's still a fantastic player, whether or not it worked out with Chelsea. But seeing De Bruyne as guy who doesn't work hard for where he is today, is absolutely pathetic.

The reason he didn't play is simple. He's not better than any other attacking midfielders that we have at the moment.

It's not surprising when you start to poke in to it.  For example I am sat in a house where two people voted for LibDem.  They feel betrayed, in essence they feel that their vote for LibDem became a vote for the Tory's, they've seen the promises made by their party pre-election either being outright scrapped or twisted in to something quite different. 

They will never vote LibDem again.  They will never vote Tory.  This time they will be voting Labour to and I quote ""Get rid of the Conservatives"", to their mind a vote for any other party could lead to the same situation they have now: Tory's in power. 

Now we can right these people off as dumb but in reality they have no more or less knowledge about politics or how the election system in this country works than the average person.  Their research in to it starts and stops at what the nice man on TV said and what their gut tells them.

No they have legislative power conferred by a legal framework that has been in existence for five hundred odd years.

They are a remnant of an earlier age and represent the interests of the crown who head up their church.

To me, this whole thing is a stunt on behalf of private schools. Too many private schools have been missing out as middle class parents instead opt for grammar schools and high performing comprehensives. If they were to be charged fees, some of them might think 'fuck it, let's go the whole hog and go private'. Alternatively, if they don't, they're still paying for other kids to go to private school.

There's also the issue that there might not be enough bright poor kids to go to these private schools - are the private schools willing to see standards drop? There's evidence which suggests that poor kids aren' the ones who are getting grammar school places, and most kids passing the 11+ are middle class - although, granted, their parents might not be earning anything like £80k.

As they get older they realise communism we would enjoy would, unfortunately, be very similar to that experienced by the USSR; grain left untransportable rotting, three wheeled tractors that weren't very good, long queues for very basic produce.

Ask a believer whether they believe their god(s) are real and they will tell you that they are. Its a common theme among believers of all religions. 

Ask a non believer if they believe god(s) exist and they will likely tell you they don't.

That is the current situation, whether God(s) actually exist is completely irrelevant.  While believers believe Gods exist then their Gods exist in their minds....

And they have freedom of thought just like you and  the freedom to worship those Gods and those rights are defined by the human rights acts at the UN, the EU and the UK, good luck with attempting to change any of that.",0,1390142775,null,0,false,0,cete6q1,t3_1vivlq,t1_cete6q1,t1_cetdoiv,null,1432009056,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Our defence is the worst of the top 7 sides (joint with United). Obviously we have Sakho and Enrique to come back, but Skrtel remains error prone and Johnson hasn't played well for a very long time. Mignolet's form is becoming worrying, he has made mistakes vs City, Chelsea, Stoke and Villa all resulting in goals.

Even during our great performances vs City and Chelsea we were very open, our attack simply cannot cover for our defence all the time. Rodgers has tried a 4-2-4 a few times now, vs Oldham away, vs Southampton away and we have looked awful in those games. There is no excuse for that anymore.

Coutinho or Sterling have to be dropped for a midfielder. If we have to play 2 upfront then it is going to cause us problems because we cannot do it in a 4-4-2, which is why we have used 3-5-2 so often. In a back 4 system, either Suarez or Sturridge will have to play wide, we are not good enough defensively for either of them not to track back. 

I have heard a lot about how we will play the big teams at home, but I am worried because most of our wins have come at home vs the bottom half. Sure that means we play those sides away but we have been nowhere near as good away from home in general under Rodgers. Having 2 upfront is going to be complicated, we've seen how bad 3-5-2 can be against the better teams vs Arsenal. They just pressed high and we had no outball. 

Rodgers needs a solution fast because now Tottenham are level on points with us, and Everton could be ahead of us before the derby.",0,1390144229,null,0,false,0,cetek5n,t3_1vlfft,t1_cetek5n,t3_1vlfft,null,1432009239,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;The British Social Attitudes survey asked the question ""Do you regard yourself as belonging to any particular religion?"" with 41.22% of respondents selecting 'No Religion' in 2001 and 50.67% selecting 'No Religion' in 2009.

&gt;The European Social Survey asked the question ""Which religion or denomination do you belong to at present?"" with 50.54% of respondents selecting 'No Religion' in 2002 and **52.68% selecting 'No Religion'** in 2008.

&gt;In a 2011 YouGov poll, **34%** of UK citizens claimed they believed in a god.

&gt;Other major polls agree with the British Social Attitudes surveys and the European Social Surveys, with a YouGov survey fielded in February 2012 indicating that 43% of respondents claimed to belong to a religion and **76% claimed they were not very religious or not religious at all**.


The entire page is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom), and of course it has all the primary sourcing.

I think it's entirely possible it was an accident and she just panicked. Just think about it - from what reports say he had the flu for a while and was off from nursery with it; he could have died under her care and she thought if she reported it or called the emergency services that she would be charged with murder. So she does the most logical thing to her, she hides the body, leaves it a week or however long and hopes that no one says anything. Then the fog lifts and guilt starts to set in as she realises what she's done; she realises she needs to get him found but by saying she knows where he is she incriminates herself, so she does the next logical thing that comes to her and reports him missing. She knows he'll be found and she wants that, but she doesn't want to be the one blamed for it. So she concocts this story that he went missing overnight and that she doesn't know where he is, thus in her eyes putting herself in the clear.

I think by not doing any sort of media appearances or pleading for people to find her son she probably thought everyone would go a bit easier on her. It's a bloody awful situation and I feel for the rest of her kids who are going to have to live with other family/foster families for the rest of their lives.

true,MessiSuarezRonaldo,null,null,"Ive been saying this for a while now but people just flat out refuse to think about it, but **Mignolet** is honestly not as good as everyone is making out and he should be blamed for a lot of our mistakes instead of our defence.


At the start of the season he was OUTSTANDING and we loved this because we needed a change.

But as the season has progressed and after most people slated Reina for all his personal mistakes (that i still attribute a lot of blame to our CB's.. which is now way more apparent) recently there have been a fair few goals we've conceded that I felt Mignolet more than should have been able to handle or he makes a mistake and fuced up

**Examples:**

last night was prime example, the [first goal](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_-cFU1RGdhc/UtrAHqf_pmI/AAAAAAAABXI/B5C9sRwrsSo/s0/18-01-2014-GifNumber-80.gif) look at how far off his line he is, sure i understand he's covering his post but look how far he's strayed despite the number of players in defence we have. 

* There are 2 Villa players in the box
* There are 6 Liverpool players in the box
* 3 defenders including Mignolet are covering the villa players with the ball
* with a 5th making a challenge
* Gerrard who is meant to be playing DM is day dreaming and completely misses Weimann
* Ball slips past them all somehow and Migs is too far off his line to get his body in the way.

and the [second goal](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ViOm6yd4R0g/UtrDIDBKetI/AAAAAAAABXU/GmFbsrQQrMY/s0/18-01-2014-GifNumber-81.gif) he makes this unnecessary one handed hero dive (the same thing he tried against city) knocking the ball over Johnsons head to beneke

* There are 2 liverpool players making him, but nobody is on him
* despite this he comes off his line to make a save with one hand (no intention of catching it) 

Both times, the ONE player meant to be covering and protecting the goal line is not there, so while the defence makes its fair share of mistakes Mignolet needs to be held accountable too.

Gay marriage was a good one, which has only just been overturned. That was basically a case of religion dictating something which was a matter of the state. 

The House of Lords by its very nature is also discriminatory on a daily basis, no matter what you think. 

Additionally, the religious are often pandered to in a manner which atheists are not. See, for example, the debate about alcohol handling in Marks and Spencer. The argument on the religious side only held any weight purely because it related to organised religion. If that was my own 'personal' view, I'd be told to get on with the job, or I'd be fired. 

How about the provision of prayer rooms across public authorities which, essentially, cost the tax payer to run? 

Or how about the fact that my taxes are used to fund religious education through faith schools etc (I was raised in a public school that basically taught Christianity as a fact, including having prayers at assembly, hymns, etc).

&gt;slick-water

Drilling fluids are not new, and while some countries may not require that everyone be aware what's going downhole, the UK is not one of those.

&gt;horizontal drilling

Been done for decades too, and is nothing new.

&gt;Per pad, this process incorporates more wells

Right, because it's cheaper and means that you have fewer rigs dotted around the place. It's a benefit of being able to use ERD and is more environmentally friendly than the alternative.

&gt;massively greater amounts of water and chemicals

Well, yes. More wells being fracked means more water being used. Is there more to this than that simple fact?

&gt; and its effects have not been considered in detail, but the data from the States do not look good

Actually it does. If you look at the US, a country which imo doesn't get regulation right on the whole, the picture is a fairly good one. Lots of unsubstantiated scare stories, lots of people complaining about things which are explicable, and not a single case of the dreaded water contamination has actually been shown, despite people now accepting the claim as fact.

&gt; many cities and districts have already banned the process or instituted moritoria

I felt like we played really well today, had a very strong second half. Starting to see some glimpses of just how brilliant Eriksen can be and how fast we can turn things dangerous on the break.

I think playing Chadli was the right idea - having two strikers against Swansea would've allowed them to have the ball even more than we knew they were going to. That being said, it was the right idea but wrong player selection going forward... I think Lamela could be dangerous in that role. 

Dembele was a silent beast today, he created several dangerous situations and should've had a goal.

Ade showed he can score goals by himself, I wouldn't be surprised to see Sherwood see what he can do with this hybrid line-up. At times we appeared to be set up as a 4-3-3, others it was almost a 4-5-1, and it was all structured to allow us to shift back to the 4-4-2 if necessary. Thought TS was good tactically today - he kept switching Chadli and Eriksen and I think it confused Swansea.

Bentaleb is looking like he can handle the defensive duties of a holding midfielder. He may not be as much of a wall as Sandro or Capoue, but his distribution is important to have in the middle of the field. I can see him giving Dembele and Paulinho some competition going forward.

As others have said, Chadli has not impressed me at all this season and once again he was anonymous on the field. I'm hoping Lamela or Townsend get to start soon.

Adebayor and Eriksen were, without a doubt, our two best players going forward today. It's hard to believe that neither of them were starters a little over a month ago. Adebayor has had a fantastic workrate under Sherwood and his involvement in our build up play has played a big part in our increasing offensive threat. Eriksen's free role is suiting him well and allowing him to constantly get into dangerous areas. I'd like to see Eriksen and Lamela on the field at the same time.

&gt;Another example of being pointlessly contrary - a non bishop could not gain such a seat. It's religious discrimination. 

Of course lords spiritual are vastly outnumbered by the lords temporal. So the non-religious have every opportunity to take an equal seat in the house of lords. The lords spiritual represent the interests of the crown.

&gt;&gt;Outside of this, how - on a day to day basis - are you being discriminated against? What is it you are prevented from doing that believers are permitted?

&gt;Gay marriage was a good one, which has only just been overturned. That was basically a case of religion dictating something which was a matter of the state. 

While the christians did have their input they werent able to prevent the law being passed, the gay christians did a lot of work to push that law through. Gay marriage was never on the books anywhere and is a relatively recent request which required all sorts of discussion and approval to be fair to everyone.

&gt;The House of Lords by its very nature is also discriminatory on a daily basis, no matter what you think. 

The lords spiritual rarely bother even turning up to vote.

&gt;Additionally, the religious are often pandered to in a manner which atheists are not. See, for example, the debate about alcohol handling in Marks and Spencer. The argument on the religious side only held any weight purely because it related to organised religion. If that was my own 'personal' view, I'd be told to get on with the job, or I'd be fired. 

M&amp;S is a global company with global policies. That issue was down to management error more than anything else.

&gt;How about the provision of prayer rooms across public authorities which, essentially, cost the tax payer to run? 

Its not just atheists that exist in this country, we have the possibility to accommodate everyone. Atheists are entitled to use these rooms for sciencethink or whatever it is atheists do too so you arent being discriminated against. I suspect the overall costs in your taxes isnt even worth refunding to you.

&gt;Or how about the fact that my taxes are used to fund religious education through faith schools etc (I was raised in a public school that basically taught Christianity as a fact, including having prayers at assembly, hymns, etc).

Religions also put money into the education system and have provided very valuable education resources for children in this country.  There is no obligation for them to provide education services but they do and rather than being a negative they actually offer a great contribution to our country. Without the assistance of the churches you would pay far more taxes than you do, so its a trade-off. 

Where are all the atheist schools? Why arent atheists providing the same services and making the same contribution to the country?

Obviously the fact they taught you that christianity was a fact hasn't prevented you from thinking for yourself.

Why is it acceptable for them to allow their animal to shit in a place that is there for everyones enjoyment? They would get upset if it was human shit, but its ok if rover does it?

It really fucks me off as i like to spend time over there with my three year old and near on everytime, some idiotic beast comes bounding over. As a dad i am thinking, is this dog going to attack my three year old? Quite often the dog  is physically bigger then her, so i have to pick her up. This is when the baffoon of an owner says ""don't worry, he would not hurt a fly"", but really as a dad, am i going to take that risk? To add insult to injury, they then look upset that i am not willing to play along with it, and instead ask them to control their animal. Also we were enjoying a nice quiet moment looking for worms, what honestly makes you think we want some slobbering wet stinky beast jumping up onto our clothes and breaking the moment.

I believe it should be illegal to have dogs off a lead, unless on private ground. Letting them shit and not cleaning it up well, should be a criminal offense, as its a health hazard.

Bannan or Williams would both do well in an advanced, non-wide role behind Chamakh, and it's mostly what they do when they do play.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I think that's my biggest issue with UKIP, the apathy towards bigoted members.

At it's core ideology, UKIP isn't a racist party. It is right wing, and I don't agree with most of their policies, but those policies aren't about race. However, to take advantage of this surge in popularity over the last few years, UKIP have seemingly been letting anyone stand under their name. This means racists, like people who supported the BNP, have been able to use UKIP to push their political careers. UKIP is the most right win party that is acceptable to the media and general public, and many of their policies fit the views of BNP supporters (stopping immigration, making Britain 'great' again, ect. ect.).

However, I said before that UKIP aren't at a core ideology a racist party. However, they don't seem to be backing that up themselves. If they cared, they would be culling the party of people who are racist, or homophobic, or sexist. But they aren't. Look how much Godfrey Bloom had to say before he had the whip removed, and I feel that was only because he made the main stream news. Through a combination of this 'political correctness gone mad' ideology, and the want to get as many politicians as possible at the next election, UKIP haven't tried to deal with the members, and actively supported them.

I get that people don't like the EU. However, I can't see how people can get behind a party that supports racists, homophobes and sexists in order to get more power. Hopefully in the run up to the elections more of their MPs antics will get on the news, and people will realise how bigoted they really are.

&gt;- Vote in ~~nationalist right wing~~ party (UKIP)

A third to two fifths of the party support comes from Conservatives.  Add it up any way you like and most of the party comes from the left of the Conservatives - this was also borne out in the post Easleigh Ashcroft study.  Contrary to perceptions looking in, a significant proportion identified themselves as being left of the Conservatives.  Their most populous demographic in their supporters is C2 on the NRS Social Grade: *skilled working class*.  In fact it's not so much nationalistic as openly patriotic

&gt;- ~~Kick all the immigrants out (somehow)~~

Nope, that's the BNP.  UKIP policy is to kick the already illegal immigrants out, like the already failed asylum seekers.  They say that if you're legally in, you're in, but you won't be getting benefits until you've filed for 5 years, at which point you will be able to claim naturalisation.

&gt;- Leave the EU ~~(bye bye human rights inspectors)~~

Whilst clearly the party wished to leave the EU, it is equally clear that the UK had human rights long before the EU ever came into existence or the UK joined it.  If anything you might want to look at the rights the EU provides in time of a national emergency or civil unrest, especially when you might really need your rights.  

It's actually UKIP policy to allow for a referendum on a Bill of Rights for the 21st Century to be written by some of the most liberal minds, under Royal Commission, and by public review - if as little as 10% of the population thinks it's a discussion worth having.  

I'm super-stoked by that, as I'm sure you are.

&gt;- ~~Close the draw bridge to the rest of the world~~

Silly Billy, that's the BNP again.  UKIP policy is to become global, to drop EU trade tariffs on places like Africa, and to reengage with our own trade deals, especially with the Commonwealth nations and the Anglosphere.  It's crazy that we don't already have trade deals with these places which we already share so much culturally, historically  and legally.

&gt;- Enjoy ~~4~~ years of ~~incompetent and/or totalitarian~~ UKIP rule

Five years, but much of their reform is spread over 10, not that they're pretending they will be winning general elections soon.  As for incompetent/totalitarian rule, they're all about devolving to the nth degree to county councils, direct democracy, localism.  

&gt;- ~~????????????????????~~

Introduce direct democracy with binding local and national referendums, Proportional Representation vote reform, devolve powers from Westminster creating a smaller central government, manage a controlled exit of the EU, begin repealing excessive regulation on SMEs.

The phrase comes from the industry itself, you'd have to ask them.

&gt;Drilling fluids are not new, and while some countries may not require that everyone be aware what's going downhole, the UK is not one of those.

Well, so far they've deliberately misled the public about what will be used in fracking fluids in the UK by implying that the formula being used for exploratory drills is the same one which would be used throughout - they've recently been forced to admit that this is not the case.  

&gt;Actually it does. If you look at the US, a country which imo doesn't get regulation right on the whole, the picture is a fairly good one.

Where are you getting that from?

&gt;Lots of unsubstantiated scare stories

Many substantiated ones too.

Shown in what sense?  [Complaints are far higher than the industry admits, many cases of contamination have been confirmed and the companies have made substantial pay outs](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/drilling-pollution-complaints-state-reports-pennsylvania).

The industry has employed the same PR company, Hill and Knowlton, which sought for decades to poo poo the links between smoking and cancer, resulting in thousands even millions of deaths, and they're using the same techniques now to sow doubt and uncertainty about the links between fracking, environmental damage and human harm.

The area between our CBs and our midfield are getting absolutely fucked.  Bony had quite a few opportunities.  We were lucky that Shelvey got injured, and Bony didn't score more than once.  

Bentelab did better in the second half, but I'm not sure if that was due to something Sherwood did at half or the fact that Shelvey got injured.

Either way, if we line up this way against better teams we will get absolutely fucked.

Not to mention the penalty that should have been given against Dawson for the push on Bony.

Switzerland have negotiated a treaty with the EU (which takes years) are historically a special case, and still have to follow many EU rules with no input. 

&gt;And while the bilateral approach officially safeguards the right to refuse application of new EU law to Switzerland, in practice this right is severely restricted by the so-called Guillotine Clause, giving both parties a right to cancellation of the entire body of treaties when one new treaty or stipulation cannot be made applicable in Switzerland.

&gt;From the perspective of the EU, the treaties largely contain the same content as the EEA treaties, making Switzerland a virtual member of the EEA.

Essentially it has to agree with new EU rules or risk breaking the treaty and losing free trade. 

&gt;In December 2012, the Council of the European Union declared that there will be no further treaties on single market issues unless Switzerland and EU agree on a new legal framework similar to the EEA that, among others, would bind Switzerland more closely to the evolving EU legislation.

This means it's very unlikely similar treaties would be negotiated with the UK. ",0,1390151202,null,0,false,0,cetgv8u,t3_1vl1bu,t1_cetgv8u,t1_cetgmv1,null,1432010416,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

- Lisburn Road: Shite loads of places, but those closest to Queen's and the cheapest would be Chalco's (a much superior version of Boojum with £1 Taco Tuesday's), The Jharna (Indian restaurant with a £5.95 two course lunch deal, again which is bangin'), Thai Tanic (gorgeous Thai food with lunch specials usually around a fiver) and Ryan's Bar which does a 2-course meal for like a tenner that lasts all day.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;The phrase comes from the industry itself, you'd have to ask them.

Shouldn't need to tell you, if you don't understand a term, don't use it.

&gt;Well, so far they've deliberately misled the public about what will be used in fracking fluids in the UK by implying that the formula being used for exploratory drills is the same one which would be used throughout - they've recently been forced to admit that this is not the case.

If you spun that anymore you'd make a ballerina. So far, they have been open about what they're using, and some companies, when questioned, have said that they may use further ingredients in their fluids at a later stage.

That's not ""deliberately"" misleading at all, it's complete honesty - further more, given that the DECC are the ones who authorise the use of any fluids put down hole in the first place this *shouldn't* worry people, and if it does they need to reform the DECC, not try to ban a completion technique we've been using just fine for 40 or so years.

&gt;Where are you getting that from?

Zero cases of well contamination caused by fracking, a whole load of complaints and an entire green lobby doing it's absolute best to ban frack jobs and yet the worst offense they've found so far is some cows dying because cowboy drillers dumped their drilling fluid into a field - something which is not only nothing to do with fracking (yet of course, it's an offense so get's pulled into the mix) and is also already completely illegal.

&gt;Many substantiated ones too.

If you want to count ""I don't like trucks going by my house"" and ""I held a lighter up to my tap and got flames"" as substantial. I'm not saying the oil industry in America behaves perfectly because quite clearly there are actors within it who do not, and yet, if, given their relatively lax legislation, that's the best the green lobby who *hate* fracking with such an absurd passion can summon up in their attack upon it, then quite honestly, it's doing excellently.

&gt;Shown in what sense?

People complain wind farms give them headaches. People complain that wifi causes cancer. People claim that 2000 years ago a middle eastern guy performed miracles.

I personally interpret the rules as saying it's not a foul unless the other guy illegally impedes your ability to play the ball. Even accounting for my biased opinion as a Villa fan... on that challenge, I don't think I'd be wrong in saying that Guzan did not do so. Even the referee didn't think so, apparently. Because if he had, surely Guzan would have been adjudged to be denying a goalscoring opportunity and should have been sent off.

Though I totally understand why the referee has given it, and Guzan has been a bit silly going in like that... I still feel that Suarez has theatrically thrown himself over in an attempt to deceive the referee. He could (and should, in an ideal world) have stayed on his feet and played the ball. The minor contact that occurred shouldn't have sent him sprawling like he did (even accounting for the speed he was going). That is -- as far as I am aware -- by definition in the laws of the game, simulation (or, diving, if you will).

like Brazil, does the UK have a massive structural deficit deficit

* UK exports to the world outside outside the EU rose continually from 2009 to 2012, in which year their value exceeded the 2007 level by 6%. In contrast, the value of UK exports to EU-26 was 13% lower in 2012 than in 2007.
* In 2012, 59% (probably 60% or more when account is taken of the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect &amp; the Netherlands Distortion) of British exports went to the world outside the EU.

Concerning myths of the EU concerning business and trade:

[THE ULTIMATE PLAN B: A Positive Vision of an independent Britain outside The European Union](http://www.dcbmep.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Positive_vision_dcb.pdf)

Myth 1: “Britain will lose three million jobs as a consequence of
leaving the EU”.

Myth 2: “Britain will be excluded from trade with the EU by tariff barriers.”

Myth 3: “Britain cannot survive economically outside the EU in a world of trading blocs.”

Myth 4: “The EU is moving towards the UK’s position on cutting
regulations and bureaucracy.”

Myth 5: “If we do leave, Britain will still have to pay billions to the
EU and implement all its regulations but without any say
in them.”

Myth 6: “The EU has a positive impact on the British economy.” 

Myth 8: “Britain will lose vital Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a Consequence of Leaving the EU.”

&gt;*""The Reality: In their 2010 survey on the UK’s attractiveness to foreign investors, Ernst and Young found Britain remained the number one FDI destination in Europe owing largely to the City of London and the UK’s close corporate relationship with the US31. EU membership was not mentioned at all in their table of key investment factors""*

The problem is:

* Lack of civic sense of responsibility
* Dogs in built-up areas only have a few green areas to run and poop so  high density of dog-walkers in an area will mean a few bad apples will lead to this cumulative problem. So some people probably enjoy the spite this leads to.
* Dogs poop large and a lot as they are roving animals and it ALL needs picking up. Much easier in the country where they will go in the bush where no one ever goes, chasing after rabbits.
* People who own dogs in cities might underestimate how much care dogs need and how much walking and pooping they take. Dogs and large urban areas often are not the ideal combination.

Now it's like Sherwood has come along and dug the whole thing up and built a shack. It looks nice but it's going to come undone. 

The Swansea goal was a prime example of this. There was a lack of discipline and general all round sloppyness in the lead up to the goal. I knew Swansea were going to score if we kept playing like that, and they did. After scoring the second we needed to go into AVB-mode and just keep the ball but keep the movement and pressing that worked so well at times.

An even bigger concern is why, if we choose to be so open, did we score so few goals today? The main argument for playing like this is that it gets you goals but we were so wasteful today. 

These two things have been the things that have been a problem with Spurs for many years, at least since the end of the 80's. We lack a clinicalness that other teams have.

Moving on a step, this leaves us to consider whether he should have simply kept his mouth shut about these beliefs as he had to have known they were controversial. Personally I'd rather he said his bit and be judged at the ballot box as I perhaps naively think that what's missing most from politics is honesty. Too many politicians are on carefully stage managed diets of soundbites designed to offend no-one. If you've got passionate beliefs, be they Thatcherism or Marxism, you can't not offend some of the constituency.

I'm not a UKIP supporter, but to me there is more made of the party ties when one of their elected representatives says something that part of the electorate finds offensive. 

And please don't jump in and misconstrue me, just because I can understand that a large number of people will see sense in his comments, I personally think they're nonsense of the highest order.

Similarly the working classes outside of the North abandoned Labour and become Tory in the 80s here (the Essex man/mondeo man).

Their head of migration was quoted as saying: 

""It’s a fact that certain Nigerian asylum seekers mock Swiss naivety and exploit the weaknesses of the asylum process. For me it’s clear: our country is too attractive as an asylum destination for applicants who abuse the system. Switzerland gives them too much time to do their dodgy business.""

He said the main reason for this is that during their interviews most Nigerians tell the same “stereotypical and unbelievable” story and not the truth. He also said “People from aid agencies who are present at the interviews come to the same conclusions,”.

It is also entirely different to having controversial opinions about the economy. Yes, lots of politicians are a bit tied by not wanting to offend anyone. Expressing your opinion is fine, but hating people because of their sexuality/colour/background isn't being controversial or honest, it's being a shit.

And perhaps more is made of a UKIP councillor's remarks. Personnally, I think this story is only such big news because it's a slow news day and his comments were just so stupid.

I am certainly no UKIP supporter. I see them as a party that's building on and manipulating people's fears, and focusing hate on the wrong sector of society. But they have a right to make their case, of course they do. Every side of politics can learn from interacting with others. UKIP do *not*, however, have a right to be homophobic. No-one does.

The Doctor himself asserts that you can't just ""become"" a Time Lord by being in the TARDIS for a long time, and yet River Song is able to regenerate.  Why?  The answer is simple: because Rory, River's Father, is the Master and so River is half Time Lord.  

When we last saw the Master, he was dying and reentered the Time War.  In the latest episode, it was revealed that the cracks in the Universe were the means by which the Time Lords were trying to escape the Time War.  Cracks which have been following Amy her entire life. The Master was the first to escape through the cracks, became Rory to better facilitate the return of the Time Lords by helping the Doctor without ever even knowing it.  Like the Master, Rory has died again and again yet returned inexplicably.  When Rory is exposed to Time energy during River's regeneration, he complains of hearing a ""banging"" in his head.  But the two biggest clues come from ""The Power of Three"" during the dinner scene, we hear Rory tapping the same beat as the Master and what is that strange object [we see sitting on the Ponds' dinner table](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_may5n1y1cC1r9anu0o1_500.jpg)?

And that was when the game was restarted, not Villa making a counter. That's the biggest gripe I've had with Cissokho yesterday ... his shot was awful but in the first half nobody did anything worthwhile in the match so there's no reason to single him out for that.

After taking a day to think the match over and thinking it over a bit better, I think it was a perfect storm situation. We've had an unstable defensive line all season, at least three of our first team standard players are out injured and Rodgers continued with his plan of re-purposing Gerrard. Add to that the poor form of Coutinho, Johnson, Kolo and the result is a very poor first half. Imho the biggest responsibility for yesterday lies with our manager and hopefully he's taken enough away from this game to not repeat similar experiments at such tough times for the team.

Last year we also saw some of Rodgers' experiments backfire horribly. This season, yesterday and vs. Hull away spring to mind, other than that he's led the team as well as anyone could have imho. It's a tough season for Liverpool, with the targets set for the team, imagine, where we would've been, without one of Suarez, Coutinho, Henderson, Skrtel, Johnson or some of the others who've been ever present when fit. 

LFC is aiming high. We've had it good so far. The league is tight this season. There are plenty of games left to play. Perhaps we can get a boost in the form of a new player coming in.

The growing gap between rich and poor has its roots in the late seventies when the chronic US labour shortage was ameliorated by increasing technology, immigration, women in the workplace, etc., there came a growing disconnect between increasing productivity and wages, with the surplus being more and more distributed towards corporate profits/top end salaries/bonuses.  Workers were forced to work longer hours, send more of the family out to work and finally to borrow to maintain the increasing standards of living they had come to expect historically, and to consume the ever increasing productive capacity.  

The money they borrowed tended to come from those increased corporate profits which needed to be invested somewhere now they weren't being spent on wages, and it seemed like a good weeze to lend the money to workers at interest rather than having to pay it to them (of course, it just exacerbated the problem of inequality really).  One other place to put those burgeoning corporate profits, which they were already struggling to find places to invest, was a whole raft of new derivative investment products, including dodgier and dodgier mortgage debts rolled up into CDOs and slapped with triple A ratings by the dodgier still ratings agencies.

Everton play a similar formation and, as we saw in the first meeting, they handled us in the center of the field.  As such, depending on who is fit, I'd like to see:

Mignolet

Johnson, Skrtel, Sakho, Flanagan/Cissokho

Lucas/Allen, Gerrard

Henderson

Sterling, Sturridge, Suarez

I won't bother trying to format this properly to paint a picture, but essentially Lucas and Gerrard playing their usual partnership, with Gerrard a bit further ahead and Henderson playing a central role and drifting out left interchangeably with Suarez who's free to drop back and retrieve the ball in the center of the pitch.  Defensively, ideally, that means Henderson drops back as a winger with Suarez or Sturridge picking up the deepest man in the center (leaving the other up top for counters) and Sterling playing as a normal winger.  It would be a bit odd considering the defensive duties placed primarily on Suarez, but Coutinho at times offers nothing of the sort and Suarez has the fitness and drive to win back possession.  We've also seen that we just can't play Coutinho, Sturridge, Sterling and Suarez all at once just yet with our options in midfield.

I'd recommend having a read through this page for more advice:
http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-tuition-fees-changes

The main thing to stress though, is that a student loan is the ""lowest cost"" debt you can ever have; it has no impact on credit ratings, you're repayments are linked to your earnings, and it grows in line with inflation rates (give or take).

&gt;**Bradgate Park** is a public park in Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire, England, just northwest of Leicester. It covers 850 acres (3 km²). The park lies between the villages of Newtown Linford, Anstey, Cropston, Woodhouse Eaves and Swithland. The River Lin runs through the park, flowing into Cropston Reservoir which was constructed on part of the park. To the north-east lies Swithland Wood. The park's two well known landmarks, Old John and the war memorial, both lie close to the 200m contour.

I'm no expert on US history, but could it not be pointed out that the diminishing value of US unskilled labour coincided very closely with the increase in Japanese manufacturing and the beginning of outsourcing of US jobs to Japan? As when any two markets of labour merge to any degree of greater extent, wages tend towards balance for both work forces. So while, essentially, yes the average joe in the US didn't do well out of the essential export of labour to Japan which occurred in the post Korean War united states, the average Japanese person massively improved their standard of living.

Anyway, while yes I do see where you're going with what you write, I still think it's a fairly absurd claim. One could just as logically claim that the big bang precipitated the last housing crash.

&gt;The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one’s time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.

and you'll get to somewhere near my views, but too many people who genuinely think that they are (small l) liberal have their own set of prejudices held dear.

I agree with you that hating someone for their sexuality/colour/background is being shit... But that doesn't mean it can't be honest to say as much. People can be stupid and honest.

I'll also agree on slow news day, but the story should be about a councillor who's said something daft rather than a *UKIP councillor*. I get wound up in the same way when the Mirror and the Mail do exactly the same thing with Conservative and Labour figures because they know their respective audiences like nothing better than hating on ""the other side"". 
Expanding on your point, hating someone because of their politics is every bit as troublesome as because of their s/c/b.

If you're assuming you're being nuked by Russia with a single 300 kt warhead (unlikely, to be honest, it would seem worthwhile to use an entire MIRV, but never mind that!), and we make the assumption that they airburst it for maximum effect, then to be outside any very serious effects of the nuke, you would want to be in Greenwhich park, or at Highgate Golf Club (7.5 km away from st. pauls).

Within 7.5 km you would get 3rd degree burns, within 2 km you would get such dose of radiation as to be fairly certain to die, slightly further in and the blast would turn your organs to pulp, and everyone within 600m would die in the fireball.

Now, it should be noted that this is with a 300 kt warhead. Many modern nuclear weapons are based around warheads with a maximum yield of around 300, however that's not to say that there aren't warheads which are far, far more powerful. For instance China still maintain a 5 MT warhead for which you would recieve 3rd degree burns within 31 km of St. Pauls, and the largest bomb ever tested would kill everyone from Gillingham to Luton, Chelmsford to Guildford.",0,1390163063,null,0,false,0,cetlvgc,t3_1vlpyl,t1_cetlvgc,t3_1vlpyl,null,1432012930,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12

Luiz was reckless and could have easily been sent off if he didn't chill down, which he luckily did. So I chose Ramires, because he was really solid. He wasn't shining, but he didn't any stupid moves either IMO. 

Defense was mehmeh and I think Ivanovic did a well enough job.

true,billschwartzky,flair8,,"I've seen several people criticizing Sherwood for not playing a DM, having way too much space in the defense, and generally just playing a risky strategy that is going to get us crushed against better competition.

I agree that these are valid concerns in a team, that ideally would not exist, but we can't pretend like we can just magically change our strategy to focus more on the defense without sacrificing some offense. I think we need to wait to see Sherwood go against a top4 team before we criticize him for not knowing how to play against one (and I mean in a game he actually cares about... not the FA cup). 

I think that doing well in the PL really requires two different strategies. One for playing against weaker opposition, and one for playing against the top clubs (I believe Jose Mourinho has talked about this). Sure we've allowed a lot of space between the lines, and it gives the other team a lot of room to work, but it also allows us to build a creative and effective attack. Against a very good team, that's not enough, but against the teams that Sherwood has played so far? That's fine, we have a better team and should be able to outscore them.

Playing a low-scoring game with few chances for either side is fundamentally worse for the better team. Let's say we create twice as many chances as the other team and convert them at twice the rate of the other team (these are just arbitrary). Then we should get 4 times as many goals as the other team. Put our conversion rate at 20%. Then in a game in which we create 6 chances we generally win by .9 goals, while in a game we create 20 chances we win by 3 goals. Thing is, all of this is subject to variation, so it's possible that the other team converts more goals than they should, and it's possible that we convert less goals than we should. But it's much less likely that those variations will affect the outcome of the game where we are expected to win by 3 rather than the game where we are expected to win by less than a goal.

Point is, playing low scoring games against worse teams allows them to have a better shot at winning. This is really nothing new, it's the whole premise of parking the bus / playing counter-attacking football. But against lower sides, I think we can afford to take a bit of a risk without the strong defensive midfielder. Against the best? Now things are flipped and we want to be lowering the number of chances, and trying to make better on our couple than the opponent does on their couple. We'll see what happens to our lineup against City.

TL,DR: Sherwood is playing a good style to take points against weaker opposition. Let's see if/what he changes when we play City before complaining too hard about him for it.",0,1390164627,null,0,false,0,cetml49,t3_1vlxa4,t1_cetml49,t3_1vlxa4,null,1432013315,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

If you do start from 2005 (which you MUST) refer to [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes#Ninth_Doctor) and you'll be GOOD!

Strangely enough I see people suggesting here to skip Eccelston's Doctor entirely and watch without a pattern and start with Smith's Doctor but that will ruin so much! 

Once you're DONE with it (It took me one month to watch everything + specials) you can try going back to Classic Doctor Who episodes. 

Another hint would be DO NOT SKIP THE SPECIALS. I just saw a thread here wherein a redditor skipped a Christmas special and missed a major plot line. So like I said just follow the episode list and you'll be set. Most of the mini episodes will be on Youtube to stream.

Something about Tennant in that episode renders me incapable of looking away from the screen...the facial expressions, from happy, to astounded, to fierce towards the end? That man just HAS it, especially in that episode. 

BUT, that being said, I like watching Eccleston, Smith, Classic Who Doctors when I was younger, but I never really just ""got into"" their looks like I did with Tennant in the role. But I've always been a fan of his. Of course like everyone else I get attached to the current Doctor &amp; when he leaves...well, you kind of don't want to like the newcomer. 

But you always do. 

I loved Smith within a few minutes of Eleventh Hour, without panting over his appearance, looks, body, face, whatever. Yeah, I was sad when Smith announced his departure, but pleased when they announced Capaldi taking the role. I think not only will he be a great Doctor, he will be able to truly inhabit the role &amp; make it his own. 

So what if he's older? He's an extremely handsome man with a very strong presence. A few gray hairs shouldn't put people off. I have several, (thank you hair dye!!!) and it doesn't diminish my appearance, my sense of self or my image at all.

As a gay man I can't wait for the day when people stop unfairly favoring ""Religious Rights"" (based on lies, prejudice and even worse, fairy tales) over ""Gay Rights"" (based on facts, fairness and science). Gay rights trump religious rights every time because only ONE is a lifestyle choice. This is universally true and will be forever. 

I'm also growing increasingly tired of the insinuation that stopping religious people from OPPRESSING me somehow means I am OPPRESSING them. They want to restrict my rights and make me follow *their* rules. That's called oppression. Me stopping them from oppressing me is not oppressing them. You obviously wouldn't know oppression if it stamped on your neck with a steel toe boot. 

The ""religious beliefs"" you defend are the **root cause** of *all* homophobia we know it today. It has 1700 years worth of gay blood on its hands and has suppressed study into homosexuality for ages. It is still being used to oppress others and cause great misery and harm in places like the US or Africa. 

Would you favor ""Religious Rights"" over *anything* else such as teaching creationism over evolution? No; JUST homosexuality I bet. 

You value the right of someone to use a loosely interpreted and roughly translated sentence from a 2000 year old propaganda manual which they hypocritically disregard in every other aspect of life as a justification for subjugating 10% of the population into second class/sub human status despite all scientific evidence being to the contrary.

On what planet is this the right stance to take 

EDIT: If I thought I was entitled to hold a slave or treat black people is inferior and claimed it was because of my ""Strongly Held Religious Beliefs &amp;trade;"" - would you ever jump to my defense if people criticized me or stopped me and claim they were ""oppressing"" me for it? Would you buggery bollocks. 

You would not defend sexism. You would not defend racism. You would not defend intolerance in any other form if someone happened to slap the phrase ""Strongly Held Religious Beliefs &amp;trade;"" as an excuse. 

Just homophobia.

He is the only person on that left side when Coutinho is in front of him in the lineup. It is not fair to expect him to pull defenders wide, play in crosses and be all the way back by our touch line to prevent their crosses. Enrique would not be able to do that either.

In addition, Kolo is right footed which means that Cissokho had nobody inside of him that would naturally drift left.

When Lucas came on, that made it even worse for Cissokho as he now had nobody to even pretend to be helping on the left.

But everyone on here acts like there is a player on Earth that could perform well in that situation.

true,Jakomus,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"People feel the need to argue based on those terms because simply sharing their experiences of what it is like to live near a large immigrant population gets them labelled as bigoted or racist.

Simply put; dumping a culture all at once into a pre-existing culture is like mixing oil and water. The two cultures do not merge into one, and this causes conflict between the two.

It's important to note that both sides are to blame, it's just that most people aren't introspective enough to admit it. There are bigots in this country, but there are also attitudes among immigrant populations that cause them to, perhaps understandably, attack before they become the victim.

A single immigrant family moving into a neighbourhood would not have received the same treatment, but because large numbers are appearing all at once, all of a sudden it becomes a case of 'us' and 'them', as unfortunate as that is.

And that was the whole thing behind the controversy of the incoming wave of Romanian immigrants. People didn't have this preconceived hatred of Romanians, they just noticed that there was going to be a large amount of immigrants from a specific country and knew from experience that this was just going to create more separation and more conflict.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; If I was the administrator of such a facility and knew that it might upset people (words like 'nuclear' and 'disposal of chemical waste' or 'disposal of chemical weapons' tend to do that) then I'd want the locals to be informed of the facts regarding the safety of my facility so that there would be less bad press. 

You might, though, cynically deduce that if you can hide what it is that your facility does then you'd be in with a better chance of not scaring them. 

I'm not at all defending this, I'm suggesting that perhaps this isn't seen as an exceptional event to anybody directly involved (MoD, Veolia), but because the press have been able to trot out the term ""chemical weapons"" it's been rather easier to now raise awareness.

&gt;**Lewis's** was a large department store in Liverpool city centre. It was formerly the flagship of a chain of department stores under the Lewis's name, that operated from 1856 to 1991, when the company went into administration. Several stores in the chain were bought by the company Owen Owen and continued to operate under the Lewis's brand name for several years. After the closure of the Manchester store in 2002, only the original Liverpool store continued to trade under the Lewis's name. It was then sold in 2007 to the Vergo Retail Ltd, but the store closed in 2010.

I don't know the figure for the UK but can you guess how much money Nigerians send to Nigeria from Ireland each year? 

Nearly half a billion at €468m.

There are only 17,642 Nigerian nationals in Ireland, including children, so if each Nigerian was sending money home, they would each be sending €26,000 to reach that figure.

In comparison, the total amount of money sent to the UK is only a little more at €529m (the British are the largest foreign minority in Ireland and there are huge numbers of Irish working in Britain)

Poles are the next largest foreign minority in Ireland after British, numbering 122,000 (7 times the number of Nigerians), yet they only send home less than half the amount Nigerians do at €174m.

Something doesn't add up there, and I think you can see there might be a bit of a priority guarding against bogus asylum seekers.

this is not a good idea.

if you have a brand new, super efficient car, with a 1.4 TDI for example, I would expect you would get 65 mpg at best.
this would still cost £47 on a good week.

its still not an economical investment due to other expenses with the car.

Not the simple fact that some random naive person walks past and thinks ""I don't like that"". If that was the case our society would collapse because at least half the street would be in prison after they cut their neighbours hedges or something equally ridiculous. 

There are two tests within the public order act, firstly the language has to be abusive or threatening (or ""insulting"" but I've heard that is being repealed in February).

I think Sterling is a great option to have and years down the road will be class, same with Ibe, but it's so much pressure on kids. I think Aspas/Alberto/Borini can still come good as forward options, but our midfield is fragile.

Ideally, I think a midfield three of Lucas-Allen-Coutinho with interchanging options of Henderson/Gerrard is good, but if we use Coutinho as more of a wide player or attacking player that reduces or options drastically once you put either Stevie or Jordan on the pitch.

I say this as someone who lived on Wolseley Street in Botanic for a year and probably had about 2-3 Boojum meals per week in that time (seriously), so my opinion is well formed haha. When I moved up to Eglantine in second year and first tried Chalco's it was like a revelation. The ingredients are so much fresher and of a much higher quality, and the fact that it's authentic and doesn't feel quite as industrial/fast food-esque as Boojum is a major plus point too. Now in my final year at QUB it's still one place I manage to visit pretty regularly.


I'm convinced that the only people who claim Boojum to be better than Chalco's have either 1) Never actually been to Chalco's, 2) Have a grossly underdeveloped sense of taste, or 3) Are those hipster melters that go about in their Boojum loyalty t-shirts to show just how much they 'love burritos, man'.

What there was during the the Victorian era was rampant rent seeking, a dire lack of universal human rights and the majority of the population were disenfranchised from their natural right to arable land to survive.

Wait... so you are rating the 19 year old over the guy that we purchased for 10 mil? Do you remember Capoue before the injury?  I was actually worried that he would displace Sandro from the spot.  He was a brickwall ahead of our defense.

Don't get me wrong. Bentelab is a good player, but does his play warrant a continued spot before Capoue, and even Holtby?

I wish that were true but most polls show that younger muslims are far more radical and conservative than their parents, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down.

Generally, 1st generation Muslim immigrants integrated quite well into British society but their children are following a more hard-line version of Islam, that is becoming more prevalent in society.

It ended up being Chelsea that caught my eye, even though I knew nothing about the team I liked the flair that their players had, not to mention those slick uniforms we sported last year. Started specifically trying to catch their games, and my love has only grown stronger since. I didn't even know about Munich until we lost at Juventus, imagine my surprise when I learned that the team I started following had won the biggest trophy in football.

Also, try not to have Newmarket Road or the A14 be part of your commute. Newmarket Road usually has heavy traffic during rush hour, and the A14 can have some atrocious traffic, especially if there's an accident.

**1st Doctor: Grumpy Genius Grandpa.** *The Aztecs*.  Fun note: the Doctor gets married for the first time onscreen! Turns out River Song is not special.

**2nd Doctor: Mad Hatter with a Box.** *The Mind Robber*.  Fun note: this episode features a ""master"" and a great ""intelligence""; but not THE ""master"" or THE ""great intelligence"".

**3rd Doctor: Gentleman Swashbuckler.** *Spearhead from Space*.  Fun note: the eleventh Doctor's first episode borrows from/references this one quite liberally.

**4th Doctor: Cosmic Hobo.** *The Ark in Space*. Fun note: Baker's Doctor was Peter Capaldi's youth hero, and will likely be a major influence on his portrayal as 12.

**5th Doctor: Posh Space Playboy.** *The Caves of Androzani*.  Fun note: this was Tennant's favorite doctor as a child; look for similar mannerisms.

**6th Doctor: Brilliant Egoist.** *The Mark of the Rani*.  Fun note: a lot of people hate on Colin Baker's Doctor for his outrageous costume and his much darker and less friendly/whimsical portrayal of the character.  Viewed in comparison to the Doctors of the new series and other modern antihero dramas, he's actually pretty awesome, although the writing on his series isn't always stellar.

**7th Doctor: Estranged Magician Uncle.** *The Greatest Show in the Galaxy*.  Fun note: Seven comes off pretty loose and silly most of the time, but when it comes down to business, he's one of the cleverest.

**8th Doctor: Sailor on the Stars.** *The Night of the Doctor*.  Fun note: Eight was the first of the Doctors to be portrayed as a romantic figure.  From this point on, each subsequent Doctor has entertained some kind of love interest.

**9th Doctor: Soldier on Shore Leave.**  *Empty Child/The Doctor Dances*. Fun note: Eccleston's stay was brief, but his Doctor set up an entire web of new stories and ideas whose ripples are still being felt in the most modern *Who* stories.

**10th Doctor: The Thousand-Year-Old Man.**
 *the Waters of Mars*/*Girl in the Fireplace*.  Fun fact: a more emotionally tempestuous, vulnerable and dramatic Doctor, Ten has become a favorite for young newcomers to the Who canon.

**11th Doctor: The Ancient.** *The Pandorica Opens / The Big Bang*.  Fun fact: much of Eleven's reign, which happened to fall near the show's 50th anniversary, is written as tribute to the characters and events seen in all previous series.

Many people who will be affected by this already have a grasp of English - enough to pop down the shops and buy things, enough to hold down a job, etc. What they don't have is the vocabulary and syntax that is found on benefits forms. People who are good enough at English for their daily lives but not fluent will be penalised.

Also penalised: the people sitting on waiting lists to learn English on government funded courses that have recently had their funding slashed.

People want to learn English. They are trying. The government isn't helping them. If the government was really motivated by the desire to have all immigrants speaking English, they'd increase funding to ESL courses, not sut it. This scheme is designed only to alienate people (many of whom might have been living in the country for years or even decades), to create division between natives and immigrants (as if there wasn't enough of that happening already) and to distract us plebs from noticing how good the patricians have it - taxpayer-funded banks giving their bankers 200% bonuses, MPs pay rises, tax cuts for the top rate tax payers - where's the money coming from to pay for this? Us. And now, the immigrants who aren't fluent in English.",0,1390201220,null,0,false,0,ceu1nc5,t3_1vldq8,t1_ceu1nc5,t1_cetril1,null,1432020504,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.""

Correct. Watch the card of the NHS body's chief data officer for the answer of how the game will be played, and in my opinion, won...

&gt; Campaigners warned many members of the public would be uneasy about private companies benefiting from their health data - especially when the spread of data will not be routinely audited. Phil Booth, co-ordinator at patient pressure group medConfidential, said: ""One of people's commonest concerns about their medical records is that they'll be used for commercial purposes, or mean they are discriminated against by insurers or in the workplace.

*What if your boss tracked your sleep, diet, and exercise?*  
http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/18/quantified-work-citizen

&gt; Inside most companies, the typical health and wellness program includes regular blood pressure checks, a list of fresh foods for the office fridge, and some sort of exercise guru who shows up every so often to tell people they should work out more. If you're lucky, you might even get some coupons designed to encourage healthier eating -- and cut company insurance costs.

&gt; But at Citizen -- a Portland, Oregon company that designs mobile technology -- things are a little different. Employees at the company are now uploading data on how much they exercise, what they eat, and how much they sleep to a central server, as part of an effort to determine whether healthy employees are actually happier and more productive. The ultimate aim is to explicitly show employees how they can improve their work through better personal habits.

&gt; Typically, this is a personal undertaking, but the same ideas are now moving into the business world. Chris Dancy, a director in the office of the chief technology officer at BMC Software, tracks his life in an effort to prove his worth to employers, and now Citizen is taking things even further.

&gt; C3PO taps into a service calls Health Graph -- which collects data from personal activity trackers such as Fitbit and RunKeeper -- but it also collects data from various software tools used inside the company, including the project management system TeamWork PM, the time tracking application RescueTime, the audio system Sonos, and the employee mood tracking service Happiily. In the future, its designers hope the system can provide all sorts of insight into employee behaviour, such as whether listening to particular types of music increases productivity, or whether employees who have entered a new relationship are less productive than those who are single. Simpson says they even plan to post employee health stats to Citizen's website.

&gt; The report from 2020Health, a think tank, found that the economy is losing tens of billions of pounds in productivity because of a high number of sick days.

&gt; The report recommended the role of council ""diet police"" be increased to offer advice to the private sector. The authors said the proposals in the report, released today, would help reduce the ""sick note culture"". 

&gt;  Among the report's recommendations is a move to allow the role of local authority health and safety inspectors to be expanded.

&gt; This would mean better advice and information on private sector employee diets, the set-up of workstations, and the importance of exercise could be given, the report says. 

&gt; Earlier this month, an independent review for the Government recommended that independent assessment of sickness claims be introduced.

&gt; (The Prime Minister) has warned that Britain's sicknote culture in the workplace was acting as a ""conveyor belt to a life on benefits"".

&gt; The Prime Minister said he would act on expert advice that recommended that family doctors should be stripped of the power to sign people off work long-term.

&gt; ""'Of course some of these people genuinely can't work, and we must support them. That's only fair,"" the Prime Minister said.

&gt; ""But it's also fair that those who can return to work should be supported to do so. We need to end the something for nothing culture.

&gt; ""'While 90 per cent of sickness cases are short-term - that stomach bug or flu that we all suffer from occasionally - nearly half of all days lost to sickness absence are because of cases that last four weeks or more.""

&gt; Ministers believe that about one in five of those who are absent on long-term sick leave should either never have been signed off in the first place or could go back to work.

&gt; ""Rather than prevent this, the care.data scheme is deliberately designed so that 'pseudonymised' data - information that can be re-identified by anyone who already holds information about you - can be passed on to 'customers' of the information centre, with no independent scrutiny and without even notifying patients. It's a disaster just waiting to happen.""

Correct. This was also called out by a redditor in the same thread I mentioned previously and is known to data scientists that it's not hard to this. [[Direct link to comment with further info.]][3]

# ` `

&gt; Booth said the five listed reasons data can be released for are exceptionally broad: health intelligence, health improvement, audit, health service research and service planning. He said: ""Officials would have you believe they're doing this all for research or improving care but the number of non-medical, non-research uses is ballooning before even the first upload has taken place. And though you won't read it in their junk mail leaflet, the people in charge now admit the range of potential customers for this giant centralised database of all our medical records is effectively limitless.""

Agreed. From the NIGB's ""Consultation on the Draft NHS Constitution - Response from the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care."" all the way back in October 2008, was stated (that):

&gt; We are concerned that what is proposed is a fundamental change to clinical practice. Whilst detailed implementation information is not available we believe it will be at variance with the assurances given in the NHS Care Record Guarantee for England and thus undermine patient's rights to consent and confidentiality. As the NIGB is the owner of the NHS Care Record Guarantee and one of its primary duties is to protect patients' rights to consent and confidentiality, this is obviously of serious concern to us and requires further urgent discussion.
 
&gt; The NIGB recognises the value of timely information to allow patients opportunities to participate in good research. However, we cannot accept the suggestion in this paragraph that, without appropriate approvals through existing legal mechanisms, anyone other than a member of the clinical team which is the guardian of the clinical record should be allowed to use the clinical record, without the prior consent of the patient, to identify patients to invite to participate in research. GPs, for instance, are the Data Controllers of the patient records for their practice. 
If they were to share information with ineligible people they would bear the legal responsibility for doing this.

If you are interested in happened next (in terms of this complaint), just ask and try to explain the rest of the story... but based on my viewing of other posts to do with this issue on here, to be honest, I don't think /r/unitedkingdom really cares too much about what happens.

Oh, and before anyone says that ""your NHS health records is / will be used for the best interest of the patient"", this was removed from the NHS Constitution in March 2013. 

The reasoning? Too ""paternalistic"".

Was your original comment vacuous and devoid of any serious thought? Absolutely. 

Look, I actually don't like the current form of our state at all. I think it's undemocratic, unrepresentative, corrupt, bad for the environment and doesn't seem to work for the betterment of large portions of the population and frankly just awful in multiple ways. 

However I don't find the private sector very inspiring either. It's undemocratic, unrepresentative, corrupt, bad for the environment and doesn't seem to work for the betterment of large portions of the population and frankly just awful in multiple ways. 

A solution as simplistic as ""fire most of them and let the private sector do it"" isn't a fully fleshed out idea to begin with in my opinion. 

When the Thatcher government shut down the majority of state organised house building, the private sector absolutely failed to fill in the void. Leading directly to our on-going housing shortage. 

&gt;What there was during the the Victorian era was rampant rent seeking, a dire lack of universal human rights and the majority of the population were disenfranchised from their natural right to arable land to survive.

Are we really in a better position now? Particularly if they do succeed in dropping the ECHR. 

The current social contract between citizen and state is terribly flawed and not fit for purpose (though taxes are not the problem in my view). The easiest example of this is that those that are elected are people in power over the population rather people who are servants of the people. 

If the private sector didn't enforce the payment of your bills would you pay them?

I'll explain it to you slowly. The three categories aren't the same let me give you an example - a ""satire"" isn't  joke per se, a ""satire"" can have many formats some that employ humour some. A satire is also social construction. It relies on the people who read/watch/hear it to have a certain understanding of the basic rule of communication and society - ie norms. So for example the Thick Of It relies on some understanding of basic norms such as ""truth"" telling and ""power"" between audience and writers to work. 

There was a really interesting example of this regarding Monty Python, it's anecdotal and on radio (I'll try find it) but it's a good demonstration. A reporter asked kids from a Hackney high school what they thought of some Monty Python sketches - almost all of them didn't find it funny and didn't detect the satire. What was missing was the shared set of norms and ideas that Monty P worked off for their humour. 

So, with that in mind you have to define what is and what isn't acceptable to ""society"" by defining all the inputs that make up that society's norms. 

A source for legitimacy is important too. You can find all sorts of places where Weber (1974), Giddens (1984) and people like Steven Lukes talk about the connection between power and legitimacy.  Legitimacy both confers and confirms what society sees as a ""norm"". That has to be defined, it has to be sourced and you have to see what sot of effect it has.

Thus when you talk about ""Should a society determine what is offensive or not"" then you have to define what that society is, where it finds its legitimacy from, what constructs its norms and ideals. How are they enforced? 

Let's take the example of the Parades in NI and I'll simplify/generalise  dangerously. The legitimacy for holding the parades by Loyalists comes from the political system and the social history of the place ie. parades were held by the Orange Order because those in power and those who controlled the society deemed it legitimate and acceptable. To them it's perfectly acceptable and not offensive. 

Now to Nationalists the very thing that made parades legitimate made them illegitimate and thus a source of controversy. It highlighted to them that society was being controlled and formed by power that wasn't their and that it had no legitimacy with them. To the it was/is offensive and unacceptable. 

So that' why I asked you what you meant by ""society and what it means. 

The problem with a lot of this debate around ""Cartoons"" is that it fails to address society as a construct and takes a set of values as absolute, on all sides. The reaction on reddit is always to start banging on about ""liberal"" values when there's no understanding of why these things happen - even if you don't agree with them.",0,1390208203,null,0,false,0,ceu3ccb,t3_1vis9m,t1_ceu3ccb,t1_ceu07kl,null,1432021291,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,o0Jahzara0o,null,null,"Everyone has it right with starting with the 2005 series. But the added information of perhaps starting with ""Blink"" or ""Vincent &amp; The Doctor"", or starting with series 5 instead because it's like a reboot of the reboot, is also very helpful for you or any Doctor Who novice to know. I'd say, with that information in tow, it's gotta be entirely up to you after knowing this. If you're the kind of person who attempts to stick with a show and likes to start from the very beginning, starting with series 1 is best. If you're the type of person who just wants to know if they'll like the show or not before becoming engrossed, sampling ""Blink"" is your best bet.

There are pros &amp; cons of starting with series 1 vs. series 5. With series 1, you're getting the fresh start that everyone began with, so the kinks of ""I don't understand what's going on"" aren't so bad. However certain aspects of series 1 can be cheesy. I personally could look past that and like it, but rewatching it with a friend, all I could think was ""Dang, this is so cheesy, I hope they don't give up on the show because of this."" 

With Series 5... I myself started with that. A friend of mine had me start there. I thank him for that because it was a special journey for me and 11 ended up being my all time favorite Doctor because of it. That being said, I was totally lost the whole way through. And having never seen British television before, the film type they used irritated me and it still seemed cheesy because of it. I felt like I was watching an infomercial. But you'll come to love the film type &amp; won't notice a difference after a while (if you notice it at all; I've never heard anyone talk about it really.)

I myself watched a few episodes into series 5 and then restarted at the beginning of series 1. But I would suggest start with series 1, if you hate it, don't worry it gets better with series 2, better with series 3, better with series 4, gets blow out of the park with series 5, doesn't even register on the same measurement scale for series 6, and just gets better with series 7.

Well, it was great when foreign companies entered on a market with 0 local competition like supermarkets, cars (imported), food (imported), etc paying the minimum wage (150 euros a MONTH, the exact money to rent an apartment). I didn't saw any newspaper story about this, let alone a politician complaining that they are distroying the local companies.

Chelsea and City have the deepest and best overall squads, as well as the best new managers, so good luck there.

The good news is that Everton have probably playing about as well as they can... I can't really see them going up any more gears.  Particularly in the final run in, where they play both Manchester clubs and Arsenal in their final six games.  There's points to be dropped there.

Liverpool worry me though.  They've got two bona fide, single-handed game winners in Suarez and Sturridge.  We don't.  Eriksen at his best can be brilliant, but he isn't going to all on his own score a hattrick like those two can.  Adebayor is vital to us, but we're leaning mighty hard on him at the moment, and he can't play every minute for the rest of the season for us.

They won 3 trophies in 4 years (2001-2005) with some of the greatest players to be in the league including some kid named Landon Donovan.

After finishing top of the table in the 2005 regular season, they ended up being moved by MLS to Houston to become a new team for (what I believe were) bogus reasons, including not having a stadium of their own even though many teams at the time didn't as well. As a matter of fact there were no real plans in Houston for a new stadium either. They won back to back championships as the Houston Dynamo after they moved.

Eventually a new team took the history of the old team and San Jose had a team again in 2008.

Sorry for the vent, but I thought it was appropriate. Yeah I've been broadsided by football before and I've had my heart ripped out by it. So I'm prepared to be a Spurs fan.

Apple generally has unanimous usability, so anyone can pick-up and go, simple UI and no 'cluttery' gimmicks or widgets. This goes to say that their OS is unanimous; old devices run the new OS with updates at the same time and no variances in the OS between device. Therefore software can be developed and work with most generations; if another force/constabulary pick-up the programme some years down the line [newer device] the software will port easily.  
  
Android, whilst being great devices, are terrible at updates. As it's open source each company adapts it for their own devices. Each device's GUI and features tend to differ. If you're running different devices the operation of the device differs, when an update rolls out it will take different lengths of time for different devices to get that update - meaning different versions of software will be in use at one. Despite being generally cheaper and sometimes having better features, the problem with android is the generally more cluttered UI taking away from simplicity, different updates and UIs for different android devices makes compatibility and software updates an issue.  

TL;DR IMO Apple and IOS allows unanimous UI and software roll outs, meting better compatibility, easier for new forces to roll-out the change and easy for noobs to pick up.",1,1390212706,null,0,1390212934,0,ceu458a,t3_1vnsyu,t1_ceu458a,t1_ceu3ti3,null,1432021676,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Most of the rest of 'the middle class' are really just proletarians by another name (and the industrial jobs have mostly given way to office jobs for example).  Even a substantial chunk of those who are theoretically the petty bourgeoisie - shopkeepers, small business owners - really act as workers a lot of the time, unless they have enough stored wealth or big enough businesses to make most of their money through unearned sources - capital gains, share dividends, rents, interest.  If you work and earn fees, wages, a salary, tips, commissions, etc., you're basically working class, regardless of if you earn a lot or a little (and professions and skilled jobs allied to, in the service of, or very important to capital obviously can earn very 'good' money).  There's also a division into productive and non productive work, but that's another story.

Beyond that, and the sub category of ""lumpen proles"" - working people incapable of organising - you get into the various ways all the people who came after Marx, whether Marxists or not, have chosen to rethink the class system, or to slice and dice the population into various economic and social groups with more or less common interests.

I sort of did become a fan that way. I watched a bit of EPL but I hated the fact that anytime I tried to discuss matches with people they'd only talk about Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal, etc. When the Quakes announced their partnership I decided to read up on the history of Spurs and I immediately fell for the team. Losing their place in the 1st division to Arsenal due to bs circumstances, Arsenal being the ones to move to North London...watching Klinnsman's goals and finally watching that fantastic trio of Bale, VdV, and Modric. Having Dawkins play for the Quakes and Spurs come over to the states to play really sealed the deal for me.

I have come to dislike the business end of Spurs though for treating our partnership as nothing after a couple years. Spurs are to the Quakes what Real Madrid are to Spurs in some ways. We attempted to buy Dawkins after he was loaned to us for two years, but he got loaned out to Villa and he didn't even play.

He said he is playing RB mostly, and looks excellent (which is a bit of a surprise, as I always thought he was being groomed as a CB, but we played him in midfield a bit to get him more confident on the ball- he really doesn't have the physical attributes for the classic RB spot.. but if it works it works).

He has apparently been very good going forward, nearly nabbing a goal on his debut and hitting a fair few killer balls into the box (albeit Wigan seem lacking in the finishing department). My mate says he is very different to a Coleman type though, a more Ivanovic in his style- where he will use his strength to force others off the ball, and it works well defensively. Again, a real surprise for me- a few years ago he looked utter shite at right back and my mate said of him ""don't be surprised if this kid is fighting Phil Jones for the England utility man position in 4 years, if he is this good in his first 2 games as a pro, he is going to go far.""

At the weekend he didn't shine though- but apparently the whole Wigan side were just woeful and never got into the game, partly due to rotation and 120 mins played midweek. No blame on Ty, and he is hoping that he will be in the first 11 next week, and the loan is extended to the end of the season.

Thing is we do use apple products for a number of reasons and don't quibble over the extra expense too much. We buy through an Apple reseller but again the margins are tight for them.

You could title it:

--
""Labour to teach job seekers better Maths and English to get them employed.""
--
&gt;""Those who don't have the skills they need for a job will have to take up training alongside their job search or lose their benefits.""


&gt;""Labour's basic skills test will give the long-term unemployed a better chance of finding a job and will help us to earn our way out of the cost-of-living crisis.""

--- 


They are basically saying that people who may have job opportunities limited by terrible English and Maths will be taught better English and Maths so if a job actually pops up they won't get written off because of it. Seems sensible. Although they'll still be competing with hundreds of people for the same minimum wage job.

Actually its a more sensible version of the Tories ""Only in English"" benefits forms. This way immigrants who can't speak English could actually get taught English whilst on benefits. If they can't be bothered to go to lessons and learn, then stop the benefits. This way people who *want* to learn (or are currently learning) don't get punished for not being good enough to fill out a complex form yet.

You could even take it one step further and get unemployed people from a country (for example Poland) who *can* speak English and Polish to be the people who teach the immigrants, creating a few jobs.

In my experience there are people who can give exact change or work out complex problems which are applicable to the things that they do, who are incapable of doing stuff on paper.

This is all bandaid politics in my opinion - if someone's adult, illiterate and capable of being taught, then it tends to suggest that the education system's failed them in the first place. And I don't think that's even the root of the problem - the number of people in this situation must be pretty small (it's an imagined problem), and the number who wouldn't voluntarily accept more education if offered must be vanishingly tiny.

The way this will play out is that those who want to manipulate the system will continue doing so - some may even fail the tests deliberately, because a few weeks of stupid classes are more of a doss than being harassed and sanctioned by the staff at the job centre. And have you ever been in classes with those who don't want to learn? They disrupt it for everyone. Forced attendance actually makes the teacher's job harder, and not only for that reason.

Time is not much different to traditional payment methods. Try and get merchant or Worldpay account and your remittance period will be weeks if not months to begin with, and at best you might get that down to 2-3 days with lots of good trading history. (years)

Bitcoin fees are much less than traditional card payments also with the added benefit that they can never be charged back, anyone who runs an online business knows how much of a pain in the arse chargebacks are, sometimes occurring weeks/months since the original transaction.

&gt;for a startup it just strikes me as a road to bankruptcy.

Really depends on the business in my opinion. There are lots of niches where I think Bitcoin could add value. And really you don't have to offer it as the _only_ payment option, that would be quite silly. It's so easy to integrate that everyone should consider adding it as an option at checkout.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"Rose is basically your typical bratty teenager when we meet her. Seeing the universe, traveling with and loving The Doctor is what makes her grow up. Rose's journey is a journey of maturation. I can't say I love her as a companion. But I grew to respect her. She grows a lot as a person over her time with the Doctor. 

The one part of her story that I don't like is that she ends up in another universe with Doctor Alt-10. I get that he fell for her, and she for him, but I don't like the ""happy ending"" for those two much. It just doesn't fit with The Doctor as we know him and I don't care if he is human. He's still The Doctor. He's still a Timelord, even if it's only in his mind and I cannot see him just settling for a human life for long even to oblige Rose. I think he'd be bored silly in a normal job, in a normal life given what he's seen and done. The Alt Doctor, he still has all those memories. He's not human in the sense that The Doctor was in Human Nature. He remembers who he was, IS. He might not be capable of regenerations but he is still a Timelord. 

Look at River post regenerations loss. She's not entirely human just because she's lost her extra lives. I don't think Alt-10 is either. That deleted bit where The Doctor gives his twin a piece of the Tardis, it makes a lot of sense to me, even if it's not canon. 10 knows that Alt-10 will need that. That he is bound to become more than just the human Doctor he is now. I mean can you really see it? Alt-10 in a normal job, with a wife and kids, not running around the universe being The Doctor? I honestly can't. He'd be bored out of his mind, and a bored Doctor that's got to be a major menace to his universe, IMHO. 

Human or not he's a Timelord and a genuis. He's known all of time and space. Why his human head doesn't just explode with all that knowledge like Donna's supposedly might have I don't know. (BIG plot hole that!) But supposedly he's the Doctor, only human, walking around with all that, all of those memories and those skills and they want us to think he's going to settle down and just be normal. Uhuh. I don't buy that one. Not at all. I don't care if he ends up lecturing at Yale or something, teaching advanced astrophysics, he's still The Doctor and he would need far more to do than that or he would go mad.

I wouldn't necessarily say though that this reddit is necessary anti-independence. Most people like me I think are actually relatively ambivalent towards the outcome, but as generally disinterested bystanders with no significant stake in the outcome I think we are yet to hear a convincing argument for independence and are critical of a lot of what the SNP say since it seems to run between embellishing the truth, blind optimism or obstinate denial of reality. It isn't that we necessarily support the Better Together campaign it's just that the *""if you stick with the UK things will be pretty much as they are""* argument is less fallible than the SNPs *""land of milk and honey""* vision of independence. 

Could Scotland be an independent country (and by independent, I mean a sovereign nation which produces its own laws and enforces them, manages to at least feed its people).... undeniably yes. Nobody credible has ever said otherwise and that whole *""Talking Scotland Down""* thing is very much an SNP creation to portray independence detractors as sad little pessimists. I think Cameron in particular has always been very mature in the way he has always said it should not be fought on negatives.

However, would Scotland suffer economically in the mid term if it were independent? Yes. I think most reasonable analysts believe that would probably be the case - although whether it would be relatively minor or more significant is less clear. One small example;

* A lot of English councils have outsourced their back-office operations (like council tax payments etc.) to call centers and fulfillment agencies in Scotland. If Scotland became independent they would need to bring those jobs back into England/Wales/NI because the law states that government data of that type needs to be handled within the nation.

* Now the rUK has a lot of capacity to take jobs like that back overnight - Semi skilled office work is pretty much bread and butter stuff and there are offices already here that could take the work on at a moments notice, especially in the service orientated Southeast of England. 

* But if you look at the SNPs ""undercut my neighbors corporation tax to attract big businesses"" economy they want to build, it will actually require decades of infrastructure changes and development capital into certain industries to develop... and in the short term the loss of the UKs creditworthiness coupled with business anxiety about dealing with a new and unknown political machine in Scotland will be very bad for business - and the effect of that will probably be felt by individual Scots. Apple Computers and Ford aren't suddenly going to start relocating to Scotland on the night of independence. 

* In effect, the type of change independence will force on the rUK can be absorbed by both the size and diversity of the economy. The type of change that will be needed in Scotland to really capitalize on the very few economic benefits independence could bring will take decades of cleverly devised investment.",0,1390218309,null,0,false,0,ceu4zvd,t3_1vnt4k,t1_ceu4zvd,t1_ceu4oc5,null,1432022170,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Is it reported on more in Scotland? Well yeah, of course it is. As I said - most people in England are relatively disinterested since it won't really impact on their lives. But that is not to say that the quality of the reporting is less or the details available are more sparse. Infact, there have been some really good analysis pieces done that if anything seem to sum things up with less bias because they are less emotionally charged about the issue. You tend to get less vitriol or raw patriotic nationalism in England, which if anything takes a lot of bias out of the pieces.

By and large, most peoples interest is actually in Alex Salmond who comes across as a truly bizarre little creature, fully of complexities and contradictions - very charismatic but hard to pin down what he actually believes from what he says. It's a great shame that he has come along at a time when the current crop of UK politicians are relatively bland PR-frontmen who can't engage him in terms of charisma. What Salmond really needs is a Thatcher/Blair/Farage style leader (not in terms of belief, but in terms of personality) with a bit more character who can engage him more directly and call him out on some of his nonsense. Unfortunately if Cameron tries to do that it just comes across as an Eton educated twit telling the Scots what to do - and so far he has been more intelligent than to give the SNP a political own-goal by dueling with Salmond 1 to 1.",0,1390219318,null,0,1390219699,0,ceu55kg,t3_1vnt4k,t1_ceu55kg,t1_ceu5316,null,1432022265,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I'll try and find the article, but there's also the argument that no matter how good a degree someone achieves, another reason why there's unemployment is because they simply lack basic skills like how to handle an interview properly.

My only complaint at the moment is that he's a young player that would seem to be more for building for the future rather than definitely securing top four in May. But other than that I wouldn't speculate on how good he is or will be this season, because I've not been watching his games every week, and wouldn't have the qualifications to assess his impact and potential in the Premiership even if I had.

If we're signing someone then I'll trust the people actually putting up the money know what they're doing beyond pretty much anyone on here.

The people who wouldn't pass basic assessment are the people with cognitive impairments. There are many reasons why the others are still considered disabled, though.

I have Asperger syndrome. This wouldn't stop me from working, as it's neither a physical nor mental impairment. Many people with it in fact are intellectually superior or even gifted (not everyone, though). However, it can, and does, provide quite a large barrier to employment, particularly when considering it is a social disorder, and most jobs require getting through interview, which is mostly a social process.

Anyone who has been for a jobseeker skills training type of thing will have been told about human communication and how 'what's being said' is a lot more than just the words being spoken. I forget the percentages, but a vast majority of it is body language. Then there's intonation, and lastly, about 3% of the full message is actually the words being used. Well... people on the autism spectrum (which includes Asperger syndrome) are quite limited in terms of interpreting non-verbal communication (which is a vast majority of communication), and also not entirely great at using it to convey messages either. this can lead to other people being pretty uncomfortable and/or suspicious, and not effective communication.

Now, if you were an employer, someone's just walked into your office and started speaking, and you're already feeling nervous and suspicious about them.. would you hire them? If you know they're autistic already, you probably would, just to keep your equal opportunities record up.

But shooting live prey with an air rifle is almost always a bad idea, especially if you are doing so because you don't have a firearms licence. It's hard to kill an animal with an air rifle, and very easy to wound it. This would NOT be a good way to start. Far better to learn how to do it properly, with some others who can show you how, and maybe get a proper licence and enjoy some safe and appropriate shooting. 

This is something you most definitely cannot just go out and do, you need the permission of the landowner wherever you are. And just being 'out in the woods' isn't good enough. To find places to shoot, just ask a local farmer, or easier still, a local gun shop. Or anywhere that sells agricultural supplies.

It would be a very good idea to get some local advice on how to start shooting, and maybe a bit of company. Getting it wrong could lead to a lot of trouble.

Being newly married to my British wife, I am currently looking at proving my British citizenship so that I can stay in the UK with the one I love.

I was born in Hong Kong, pre-handover to the Chinese government. My mother was a long serving civil servant with the British government (something like 30+ years) in the Ministry of Education. My maternal grandfather was also a long serving civil servant as well. Both of them had received a ""Certificate of Naturalization"" based on the Immigration Act of 1948.

Based on the Certificates mentioned above, I applied to get proof of my citizenship certificate as well. Unfortunately, the Home Office decided that retroactive laws that came into effect after my mother was issued her citizenship nullified her claim to British nationality. 

Because my wife is in a profession which offers really low financial rewards (she's an artist in the performing arts), we also do not satisfy the financial requirement for the spouse visa. I'm the main breadwinner between the two of us (I easily make enough to twice cover the financial requirement but I'm not allowed to take into account my employment).

TL;DR: UK Home Office sucks. I have long history and affiliation with UK but not granted proof of citizenship. Really hard to stay in the UK with low income sponsor.",0,1390221641,null,0,false,0,ceu5jeh,t3_1vo1js,t1_ceu5jeh,t3_1vo1js,null,1432022453,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've blasted rabbits with 12g , not ideal as it's fucking loud (makes the second barrel shot more sporting though!) . I'm no expert on air rifles but they will work and a lot less hassle as you can get some without licence. Some air rifles over a certain power require licence and thus more effort. They all have advantages, I could shoot pigeon and rabbit with 12g and shotgun licence is very easy to get, can also use it for clays etc. 

Ideal would be a .22 rifle with a nice suppressor. 

Ultimately you need somewhere to shoot either friends land or knock on doors. If you go the firearms license route the police have to check and clear the land it's suitable whereas air rifle and shotgun it's not needed. I mostly shoot clays so I'm no expert. Im at work so having to keep it short but it depends on how much effort/cost you want to put in. 

Shotguns: loud so only good for few shots but can be used on pigeons and clays. Easy to get. 

Air rifles (non licence): Easy to get but limited in use 

Firearms : harder to get (licence, cabinet, land clearance) but more suitable, can't really beat a suppressed .22 or .17hmr 

All in all it's great, I love the peace and quiet of walking in the countryside with the gun in hand, the sense of achievement and success in bagging something and the sense of pride of sitting down with a farmer and his family eating rabbit pie that I harvested.

I used to hunt a lot of rabbits and pigeons with my air rifle back when I lived in the countryside. These days I've had to move into the city, ironically to work for a shooting magazine.

Shooting rabbits and pigeons with air rifles is a cheap, sustainable and healthy way of eating. I assume at this point that you'll be shooting them for the pot rather than as a sustained pest control operation! A firearms certificate (FAC) is expensive and time-consuming to obtain and firearms themselves generally cost a lot of money to buy and own. A decent air rifle is more than capable of cleanly killing a rabbit or pigeon and pellets cost next to nothing.

There are two things to consider - your competency, and where you can shoot. Competency comes with time, patience and maybe a little bit of training. It's worth finding somebody to show you the ropes, from how to clean an air rifle to how to dispatch a wounded rabbit by breaking its neck. Knowing how to kill an animal humanely is extremely important, both in terms of where you shoot it and what you do if you wound it. All these things *could* be learned from books and YouTube videos but its generally a bit easier (and more sociable) to learn from somebody experienced. And definitely spend a few weeks shooting tin cans before you try and take down your first bunny!

*Where* you can shoot depends on where's safe and where you can get permission. Farmers will be willing to give you permission (unless they have an arrangement in place with somebody doing it commercially) and other landowners will usually be fairly pleased if you can make a dent in the rabbit population. Ask around when you buy your air rifle, ask your more agricultural friends and maybe even join a messageboard.

You've made me a bit nostalgic. I still have a lovely air rifle at my parents' house and there are a few airgun magazines being run from the office next door. The magazine I work for deals almost exclusively with shotguns and rifles but I still have a soft spot for air rifles in particular - very simple sport, and without a lot of the hassle that comes with 'proper' guns.

**tl;dr Loads of people hunt rabbits and pigeons with air rifles, it's brilliant if you're into that sort of thing and are prepared to do it right.**

If you have any more specific questions I can try and answer them. Or it'll give me an excuse to pop next door and browse the lovely airguns they get in to review.",0,1390222486,null,0,false,0,ceu5oye,t3_1vo0yk,t1_ceu5oye,t3_1vo0yk,null,1432022528,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

As far as the software goes, if the police force are going to use these effectively, rather than just use them as expensive paper notepad, then they are going to have to engage with technology contractors anyway. 

For a project like this to be worthwhile, it's crucial to understand that the tablet units themselves are just end components of an IT infrastructure. What matters is the software they run, and how it integrates with the rest of their systems. *Hardware is the cheap bit* (or should be).

Once the system is developed and running, cheap, generic pads is the best option because it means they can be replaced cheaply. All you need to do is download your software on them. Minimal marginal costs vs expensive marginal iPad costs.

So its a choice between creating an effective, holistic IT infrastructure, or just using tablets effectively as isolated units. If the latter, then there are still far cheaper options than iPads.
