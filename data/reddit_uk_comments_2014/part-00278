Why Borini is starting is strange given how much money we spent in the summer, he should have been shipped out.

The defence were horrible and full of holes ( I mean.. ALOT). I can't believe our defence this season is horrible than last season's. Lovren is a flop so far he keeps making mistakes here and there.

 Sakho is well *sigh... Sakho.
Skrtel has the face but he doesn't have the skills. Manquillo is nervous every game, only Moreno has the balls to actually become good.

The midfield is fucking dead without Allen/Can. Gerrard is too slow and old and he's afraid of shooting the ball like the old days. Lucas offers absolutely nothing to the team. Lallana has not proven his price mark yet. 

I would say the strongest point of our team is our attack but that would be an understatement of our last year's attack. Suarez and Sturridge were ready to take on the world. I love me some Balo but he can never produce that kind of magic Suarez created for us. I fucking miss the damn man.

I'd be positive but right now, It seems too damn hard.. It's the 3rd game in a row where we played like shit. If we can't even fucking win against lesser teams like these.. What do you guys expect when we're up against the big guns later in the season?

I say this because whether or not it is true is entirely irrelevant as you would almost certainly be posting it anyway.

Yes, you could argue Lucas was a desperate option to keep a desired formation, but lallana was so much better coming on, whether or not that was the plan who knows.
But we all know a Gerrard Lucas combo fails more times than it will succeed. 

Skrtel should not have started. Ball watching he first goal hard, can't remember off the top of my head about the second. Why break up a Sakho Lovren combo that was shaky, but showing signs of real growth. Instead he slots mr fatal mistake a game. I just hope he (Brendan) can get a partnership working because right now it looks like all our defenders are trying to help each other and everyone and not let the rest of her team and themselves do their fucking job. How many times have our defenders gone after the same ball or shouldered DM duties or shoot out wide like a Wingback?!

Let Henderson run!!! What the hell was with Gerrard and hendo reversing roles today? Gerrard was trying to run people down and then later was running up the pitch, meanwhile hendo was being a temp passer turned Holding mid by game over.

Migs needs some damn competition and a little backbone. I don't like all the shit he's getting cause he's making saves still, and my god it's got to be hard with our defense. But he needs to shout like Pepe, get in our players faces and tell them to wake the fuck up!

And finally, somehow, someway we have all underestimated just how fucking good Luis Suarez is and was for this team and all the off the ball and intangibles he added to our gameplay.

YNWA it's going to hurt today but have faith in Brendan that these our growing pains not Tottenham pains.

1 Migs is just pure nerves. Shaky on the high ball, claiming long balls and decision making over leaving his line. Unfortunately, this can't be helped other than training or buying a new GK (Valdes...)

2 Defence is fucking atrocious. No communication, poor movement and the passing out is less accurate than a blindfolded rugby player looking for touch. This CAN be helped by Rodgers sticking with Sakho. I haven't really liked what I've seen from Lovren, esp. not for £20m, but Rodgers needs to decide if he's sticking with him, or going back to Skrtel, because Sakho is not the weak link. 

3 Midfield is light. Rodgers needs to either drop Lucas deep, or not play him. Gerrard does not have the legs to be DM, we all know this. I know injuries to Can and Allen haven't helped selection right now. But if Gerrard is to play deep, we need someone who can string passes with Hendo and the front line i.e. Lallana or Coutinho, not Lucas. Alternatively - and this is the solution with our full, healthy squad, we should look to ease Gerrard into the super sub role. I will always love Stevie, but it's time to be brave and move on - with our shaky defence, a poor DM is not what we need. A Can-Hendo-Lallana-Allen-Coutinho group is more than enough to choose 3 appropriate MFs from. We can look to Stevie to provide inspiration off the bench, but not for 90 minutes, as sad as it is to admit. 

4 Forwards aren't clicking. Nothing much we can do atm without Studge. I'll admit I also called for a Balotelli-Borini front two, but Borini was average and pretty quiet, and didn't help Balotelli as much as I'd hoped. We have to stick with two up front, that much we know, but maybe till Studge is fit and firing (please christ let that be in the derby), Balotelli-Lambert is the option.

true,johnatary,lfc68,,"I agree with Valdes, I think just the experience he has will inject the defense with some confidence, which IMO is what is lacking.  Most important though is just experience and playing time together, collectively their positioning is terrible and considering the way we play positioning is the most important thing for the defense.  Sakho and Lovren's collision really highlights how poor their movement as a unit is (I think that was the second time this season that has happened as well).

I think we definitely need a DM, although I think Brendam is counting on Can to fulfill that role.  The more pressing concerns for me are:

* Gerrard getting marked out of the game

* Lack of space when we are on the ball

* Ineffectiveness/nonexistence of our press from last season

I feel all of these could be solved, or at least remedied, by rotating the midfield.  Would love to see Lallana, Sterling, Henderson, and Gerrard starting in a diamond where the four of them unpredictably alternate positions within the formation.  Apart from messing with any efforts to man-mark Gerrard, I think this has the potential to really pull the opposition's midfield around and create time for players to pick their passes more carefully.

Attack-wise I think we are fine, the 'toothlessness' of our attack stems primarily from the issues in the midfield highlighted above.  Balotelli actually really impressed me today, he was miles better at distributing some balls and created a few decent chances today.  The one where he held up the ball and then rather then run at the defense with the ball (as I fully expected him to do) he laid a beautiful ball in to Borini who really should have crossed it.  But he's really seemed to work hard and has had none of the attitude problems I was worried about, despite plenty of opportunities to show them in the past few games.

Center mids are another thing, and Stevie G definitely is not one. His passes looked too safe today, and he couldn't be bothered to make a tackle. His legs are gone. 

Looking at it, it's probably the latter issue. Our midfield depth is massive. If Capoue's not playing, that's fine. Dembele can fill in that role. Is Stambouli missing? Slot in Paulinho or Bentaleb. After Gerrard, they've only got Joe Allen and Lucas.

&gt;__Trepanning__, also known as __trephination__, __trephining__ or making a __burr hole__ (the verb *trepan* derives via Old French and therefrom via Medieval Latin from the Greek noun of relevant meaning *trypanon*, literally ""(a) borer, (an) auger"")   is a surgical intervention in which a hole is [drilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill) or scraped into the [human skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull), exposing the *[dura mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater)* to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases. It may also refer to any ""burr"" hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds. It is often used to relieve pressure beneath a surface. A [trephine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trephine) is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone.

I'm not on the ""no"" side. It wasn't an endorsement of the status quo, it's sad that even now after it's finished yes supporters can't see that. I voted against the white paper and despite all the cries about tories and all the rest I was not voting for anyone.

I'm sad about the entire experience, it's made less than we were before it. Nobody has won from it other than a fleeting hope that people get more involved in politics.

The no side made a lot of magic promises towards the end that they seem unable to deliver on. I had wrongly assumed that they'd prepared these in advance a while back but it seems they're been quickly prepared and in all honesty it's no wonder the rest of the UK is up in arms at what seems to be desperate bribes.

The attitude I hoped from yes supporters was as I said it was - a sadness, yes, disappointment, but an appreciation for democracy being done.

If the vote had gone yes I'd certainly not be bitter, I long ago came to terms with the prospect of independence and that if it's what Scotland voted for then after the vote I'd have to get on with it.

Again though this is not a victory for anyone - for me it's a relief it's over - but I'm no better off, things haven't gone in the direction I want.

First is is the disproportionate size of England compared to the other countries.  The current House of Commons is effectively dominated by England.

A US-style senate seems guaranteed to produce gridlock, with conservative England and Northern Ireland neutered by left-wing Scotand and Wales.  I don't think England is prepared to accept such a check on its power.

Second is the long history of ridiculous (to outsiders) over-centralization of power in London.  I mean, cities and counties can't even collect their own business or property taxes: they have to give everything back to the central government.  while this has been challenged recently in Scotland, the mindset that all solutions have to come from London is ingrained in the English psyche to an unfortunate degree.

Balotelli has looked good with hold up play and work rate but aside from those 2 headers he whiffed during Spurs and his goal vs Ludogorets, he hasn't offered much offensively or creatively, and Borini paired with him today looked shit.

Lucas. Holy fuck dude, you used to be one of the hardest hitting tacklers in the league, and now your injury has made you more useless than a traffic cone as a DM. I love you for your LFC Cinderella story and the work you've done for us, but at the moment you're not good enough either.

Hendo looked mediocre today and Manquillo looked out of his depth (for once, I think he's been fantastic so far but not today). Moreno looks like a great signing but still needs some polishing.

Gerrard...his reliance on penalties, corners, and set pieces is invaluable but at the cost of what defensively? He and Lucas just don't mesh in the middle of the park anymore and he looks tired most of the time...and his passes aren't perfect anymore like they used to be. This one really hurts to see him wind down in terms of quality but it's inevitable...he shouldn't be starting every game anymore, and brought on as an super-impact sub in the games that he doesn't.

Our offensive capabilities on set pieces are really poor in relation to how many big bodies we have in the box, and the same goes for our ability to defend set pieces. How do we fix a problem like that?

The story itself was enjoyable to watch but it had a similar ending to Hide that I didn't like. They both had the Doctor say ""This isn't a (ghost/heist) story, it's a (love/__) story"". Granted, this time it felt less like a tacked-on ending compared to Hide but I'm not a big fan of this kind of reveal.

One thing I found funny is that Capaldi has his own moments of flapping his arms about like Smith, especially in the scene where he tells everyone to shut up. Whether that was just how he acted or if that was a conscious nod to Smith’s Doctor, it was a nice contrast to the darker moments he had in this episode. I can’t quite imagine the other NuWho Doctors knowingly give their companion (? Team member?) something that they can use to commit suicide in case of emergency. He seemed genuinely surprised that Saibra and Psi were alive. I like how Twelve seems to have a nice balance of light and dark moments throughout this season. There were two lines that I liked from this episode. ""I was hoping for minimalism but I think I came back with magician!"" Great line, and a nice self-aware moment.

Another thing I noticed was this is the second time Clara had to not do something to escape the villain this season. In Deep Breath, she had to stop breathing to be detected and in this episode she had to stop thinking about her guilt to escape detection. What's next, she has to stop hearing or being alive for a short time for the monster to not find her in the future episode? 

I’m starting to notice Twelve’s theme song now and it’s interesting that it was played when the Doctor gave the transporter to Saibra so that she could escape the Teller. After being used to hearing “I Am the Doctor” whenever the Doctor’s being successful at something, it seems like Twelve's theme is played when he has a dark moment.

The Doctor referencing the woman in the shop was nice as well, perhaps that'll play into the whole Missy thing.
Overall the plot structure was pretty solid, the pre-credits introducing the heist crew and the reuse of the memory worm was a good way to get us into the plot and managed not to feel too cliché while still sticking within the confines of the genre. Speaking of getting us into the plot this episode just launched us straight in, no dilly dallying around at all which was great. 
The Teller was an interesting creature, from the season trailer I thought it looked a bit like a bog standard alien and didn't have much interest in it but it's ability was interesting and the whole blackmail twist was unexpected, the love story element was a good way to wrap up the Teller and didn't feel as tacked on as it did with the monsters in Hide (I swear I don't hate Hide).
The time travel elements of the plot and peoples motives were very well executed and though I predicted the Doctor being the Architect from the start it was still very satisfying to see everything come together and get tied up with a little bow.

And when he finds out they are actually both alive. He is completely shocked and eventually enlivened and happy when he can hand them their payment.

Again I think that Twelve is trying hard to come to terms with the fact that he cannot save everyone. He doesn't want the fear of letting people die to bring him past the breaking point again. I think that deep down he really does want to be a hero and save the day. He wants everyone to live. (And nearly every one does in this episode). So in essence the Architect's (his own) payment to him is that Saibra and Psy lived.

true,al455,mccoy,McCoy,"Series 8 continues its run of excellent episodes! For a change we really got to see Capaldi’s Doctor lighten up a bit which I think was starting to be needed a touch. From his, albeit a bit forced, compassion for the dying mutant, to later in the episode – ‘Shuttity-up-up’ (very nice channelling of Malcolm Tucker!) and trading anecdotes about Cesare Borgia!

This is the first time Doctor Who has tackled a heist-film and it brings a lot of life into I thought. Whereas Robot of Sherwood was a more traditional light and breezy adventure, Time Heist had a degree of maturity and a lot of great sci-fi elements: Clones, cyber-punky cyborgs (outfit and all!), mutants, and of course The Teller. Excellent prosthetic work and a brilliant execution of a relatively simple idea. This episode just really feels consistent tone-wise with the rest of the series so far, more-so than Sherwood. Although I think Sherwood was exactly where it needed to be in the roster.

Less Clara-focussed than other episodes in the series, which I think is a bit of a benefit from time to time. The direction was great as well, especially considering it was the same director as Listen. Considering Thompson’s Sherlock sensibilities, it really shows that he’s more suited to a Doctor Who heist-film, than let’s say more fantastical elements seen in his previous work on Who. Although as it’s co-written by Moffat, his guiding hand was felt throughout, especially in the resolution. 

Overall: great development for Capaldi’s Doctor, who has some great lines; superb direction and prosthetic work; more subdued electronic score from Murray Gold; and in general a story that feels fresh, new and certainly Doctor Who.

Villa and West Ham have attacked Gerrard.  They've pressured us deep and exposed our frail midfield.  They transition fast against us because they pressure our midfielders and we simply can't keep up.  This is going to keep happening all season until a systemic change occurs that takes so much responsibility off of Gerrard and distributes his duties across the middle of the pitch.  He doesn't contribute much to the defensive effort and if you shut down his ability to dictate play then we may as well play with 10 men instead.  We need to change to a deep player that can influence play defensively and alter our passing game from these long, slow passes to the flanks.  We have the players to be far more dynamic than we are currently displaying, we should be able to play through the middle or spray it wide as needed with Coutinho, Lallana, Henderson, and Sterling... all of them can change their play to match that in the blink of an eye.

Without Suarez our attack was always going to be far less potent than last season.  But when you combine that with how other teams have identified our current midfield setup as the weak link, it just turns into a shambles.

There needs to be some concessions made to them being bitterly disappointed that their dream has died - I'm sure everybody is sympathetic to them, they had so much emotionally invested in the result and they got close.

But some amount of humility and respect would be welcomed from them.  Some amount of acceptance of the democratic process would be welcomed from them. Some amount of concession that they were fairly defeated would be welcomed from them. Some amount of acceptance that the referendum has finished would be welcomed from them.

Instead all we have is bitter recriminations, accusations, finger pointing, hate and bile.

Paying for ever-increasing debt means you have to either increase the tax revenue proportionally or cut spending elsewhere proportionally.

1) Agree here. I don't rate migs. He apparently skipped geometry in elementary school, because his positioning is so shite I can't even begin to chat about it. Goal #1 should have been his ball - it's in the 6yd box. Goal #3 could have been made much more difficult.

2) I fully believe that our defensive issues are midfield issues. With Gerrard in, and especially with Gerrard and Lucas, we just can't cover them appropriately. How many times to do you see opponents receive the ball, turn, and just run at our back four with apparently no DM there to do... well... anything? This is a recipe for disaster, and caused goals #2 and #3. We expect too much from our center halves if we expect them to be able to deal with this consistently, all game long against even middling quality opposition.

3) See 2. Drop Gerrard. Replace with anyone.

4) Not really sure. With no midfield control, the service into forwards is generally not high quality - even Sterling seemed frustrated by that today. Don't disagree that I'd like to see Balotelli - Lambert, but that provides us with two big men up front that don't like to run into channels, something Sturridge does innately and which opens up the game significantly. That said, midfield control would change the whole game up front, as I thought we looked more connected today, if not necessarily 'better'. The gel will come - but we can't build it on an ancient midfield of Gerrard and Lucas. Even Hendo, who can run forever, looked exhausted after trying to cover for those 2 today. Noticeably better with Lallana in the 2nd half, but the wrong midfielder came off.

Just my 2c, but I don't necessarily think the defense is as much of the issue - losing the midfield is killing us (as is usually the case when it is a bit enigmatic _where_ the problem is in a struggling squad).",0,1411243403,null,0,false,0,ckntlgd,t3_2gywhn,t1_ckntlgd,t1_cknrmhw,null,1426904627,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Also, the Head of Security reiterating to herself and her guards how being fired is deadly is just a badly-written and awkwardly placed piece of exposition.

And the set design was pretty rubbish once they had left the lobby. You can tell they used that hallway about five separate times, not to mention the endless row of vaults was the same set on repeat.

No one had showed up to be saved, try to kill him, or even say ''hi''. Never in all his years in the box had this happened. This complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong.

I voted yes, the result didn't go our way, and I'm getting on with my life, but that's easier as an English person here. A lot of the yes supporters on /r/scotland were incredibly vested in a yes vote - out campaigning, leafleting etc. It's still only been two days so the discussion isn't going to be dropped immediately. Like /u/grapeathletics said, the conspiracy theories and anger posts are being downvoted as they should be. In my own opinion, /r/scotland has been orders of magnitude better in the run up to the vote (and afterwards). The IRC on election night had a mix of opinions and was very amiable.

It was likely the most important vote most people will have in their lifetime so it's understandable it will take a while for people to get over it.

As an aside, /r/uk also seems much more tolerable after the result - there was an awful lot of nastiness and anti-Scottish sentiment on here in the run-up to Thursday and this post could easily be flipped the other way.

I wonder though if Crichton's knowledge could be used to help the Doctor and vice versa (if we merge their time lines pre Peacekeeper Wars). Crichton has the wormhole knowledge which we know can travel through parallel worlds and even into other universes. With that information the Doctor could probably find Gallifrey much easier. In return for that information he could most likely do a mind wipe or information removal for Crichton so he would no longer be a target or a danger.

However, this discussion has also alerted me to an interesting parallel.

There's just no decent discussion on here anymore.  Posts like these, which actually try to analyse the game, are ignored.

I do agree with you that Lambert and Borini are not good enough.  However, I must disagree when you say that Borini looked shit today.  I thought he was one of our best players in the second half and was putting in more effort than half of the team combined.  You have to remember that it was very difficult for him in the first half as the rest of the team were so bad.  Balotelli wasn't much better - he offered very little other than the part he played in our goal.  I'm tired of players like Borini getting so much stick just because it's the flavour of the month.  Other players were much worse than him today, but surprisingly, very little was said about it.

Again, I pretty much agree fully with what you say about Lucas.  Used to be one of my favourite players, but has been very poor recently.  I still think he can find his old form if we give him a chance.  It would be good to see him replace Gerrard in the deeper role every so often as that is his natural position.

With regards to Gerrard, it's gotten to the stage where his set pieces aren't even that great any more.  Don't get me wrong, there's no one I'd rather have taking penalties - but his corners and free kicks haven't been great recently.  I would happily have Coutinho, Henderson, Lallana etc. take them.  With that said, he can still offer a lot to this team.  He *is* still one of our best passers.  He just needs less game time to continue playing at his best.

I really don't understand why we are so bad at set pieces.  It shouldn't take a world class defensive coach to stop the players making the mistakes they've been making.  More often than not, it's simply a lapse of concentration - someone losing their man or even picking the wrong man.  Then again, the same problems have been apparent for so long, the issue must run deeper.

I thought Lallana was very good today, the whole team played much better after his introduction (although that could also be due to Brendan's half time talk).  I think he will be a good player for us.  Once he gets used to our style of play and those around him do the same, he could be very important for us.",0,1411246922,null,0,false,0,cknv45j,t3_2gywhn,t1_cknv45j,t1_cknt2bw,null,1426903919,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

As someone who is not very well educated or the brightest spark, Could you give me tips on where to look for unbiased information. 

I almost feel like I can't trust anyone these days when it comes to politics. It does seem like everyone has an agenda and they are willing to use and walk over us to get to that agenda accomplished.

Keep the credit card healthy i.e. pay off in full each month. 

Keep the monthly outgoings sensible.  Mobile, utilities, Council tax, food. 

Have the deposit, survey and legal fees saved you will need to pay a deposit to the solicitor to carry out the searches. 

Removals can cost if mates and van not available.

Budget for white goods, furniture and future repairs (great to have builders and gas safe plumbers as good mates)

Keep all payslips to hand I only had to supply last three but they can ask for more.

Have copies of all other sources of income or future income i.e. pension plans.

Have your employers details up to date and don't give any intention to leave your job. They may contact your employer if you are thinking of leaving your job be prepared for a knock back if your employment history is not stable i.e. changing jobs a lot in a short time frame lenders are looking for a safe and stable investment.

If your self employed or a contractor you may have to provide up to 5 years of accounts.

Purchase a good printer scanner if you don't have access to one as you will be signing and sending a lot of documents and will need lots of copies.

Sign everything in blue ink easier to ID when sending off a copy instead of the original document.

Start looking at life and critical health insurance if you don't have any make sure it covers the amount of the loan your looking at.  

You will be required to purchase buildings insurance buying it off the lender will speed up the approval process and its fee will be in the monthly mortgage payments. Worth the pain just shop around for a new deal from a cheaper insurer a year later.

A independent mortgage adviser may find a better rate than just speaking to your bank however the fee they charge will be in the monthly payments.
Check local reviews for a good solicitor.

New builds v older houses down to personal taste however new builds have limited room to expand or internal modifications pre-second world war solid as a rock with room to expand if not already done.

Research where your buying council tax band, will car insurance increase how much petty crime and anti social behavior, legal survey never searches for that info.
 
Finally get an agreement in principle before house hunting this may bag you a house quicker (make sure the sellers agent knows this but don't tell them how much it is for) and it avoids disappointment if the lender says no to you after you put an offer in. And haggle if the property has been on the market for a while knock 10k off the asking price as your first offer.

true,PerfectlyDarkTails,cnty-wales,North Glamorganshire,"Yes, though spelling is more a Dyslexic trait, as I've been told that I have a significant level of that as well.  I do have significant issues with writing as my writing style is never the same, I slowly print but I can make poor mistakes with spelling and forms are often an issue as I can interpret what's read differently, I can't read for very long before getting physically exhausted.

Dyspraxia can also affect typing with hitting the wrong keys, compounded by the dyslexia.  Dyspraxia can affect speech in a way that words can sound differently, again compounding the affects of listening issues and interpretation, I may not simply hear what's been said.

It also affects my grip and strength, I am a very weak individual unable to gain strength through exercise. With the lack of grip, I'm prone to dropping things like pens for example, I could write then suddenly drop the pen.  This can be a significant danger to health with handling dangerous materials like hot water.

Dyspraxia also affects balance and I'm often bumping into things, tripping over and loosing balance, carrying things could often result in losing balance and falling over.  The worst fall I required knee surgery.  My Tourette ticking and chronic migraines can and have made balance worse.

I have an ongoing neurological examination to figure out what exactly is going on.  My neurologist has no doubt there is a good chance it is Dyspraxia, but there's no typical test for it.  Otherwise a psychologist hinted Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Tourette's and a form of Migraine are more common in ASD individuals.  I do also have voices for company, I do use to distract from pain among other health issues like ingestion issues.

In terms of work, manual labour is strictly prohibited, I'm at all times rely on a walking pole and an aid for traversing roads and traveling like a parent and my social support worker, I am luckily I do hold a degree but my inability of traveling without illness and in need of some care does limit me how and where to work, life in general, regardless of work is an absolute every day battle.

true,skwinter,lfc68,,"As a keeper your first responsibility is the shot though, if Noble is open on the top of the box that's for the team to take care of. You try to give yourself the best odds to deal with everything, so in this case stepping narrows the angle and gives him an opportunity to take care of any direct shots or crosses to the near post, but it leaves him open for longer crosses and chips. I just watched the gif of the goal again and I'm willing to bet the vast majority of keepers would be in that position. I'd also wager that 90% of the time the striker wouldn't attempt it and 98% of the time they wouldn't get it, but in this case he did. I honestly don't fault him for that at all. If he had been further back would he have stopped it? Yes, most likely he would have, but then Sakho wouldn't have chipped it and probably played a ball across and Mignolet would have to deal with a cross (which from a goalkeeper's perspective is harder to deal with). May not have conceded a goal in this instance or may have. It's like when one defender gets caught having to mark two people: does he go to the man on the ball or try to eliminate the pass? It's a judgement call that doesn't always work out. In this case Mignolet played the shot and ended up getting beaten by a very good chip. It's unfortunate that it happened but it would have beaten most keepers as most keepers would have done the exact same thing. He is by no means responsible for this goal, or really any of the goals we conceded today.

We are a United Kingdom and it is fair that in the more remote areas we subsidise basic services in order that everybody has access. That is why Scotland receives a bit extra.

The idea that ""it's our oil"" and we should be richer because of it is rubbish. I don't agree with that assessment of fair.

The idea that we all should have exactly the same per head is also not fair.

The idea that we get free prescriptions is not rubbish. If you want them in England and Wales ask your representatives to find the money.

A great deal of things are devolved in Scotland so we can choose to spend our money how we see fit.

I don't agree with the amount of university funding that we do - we're paying for an awful lot of shit degrees and scamming young people into wasting 4 years of their lives. However I do agree with free university tuition.

Scotland runs Scotland the way we want to run Scotland and it will always be that way until we choose to cede sovereignty (likely to the EU in the distant future when it's good).

true,Dardanator,null,null,"I think actual federalisation would be a very bad idea, at least for a few decades. The reason being that a federation means that each federal subject (I'll say ""state from now on since that's what they're usually called) has a set of powers enshrined into law. The federal government cannot take away powers from states at least without their consent, and it can't suspend a state government whenever it likes and impose direct rule.

The reason I think this is bad is because devolution is something we are still experimenting with, and it's currently happened in a very imbalanced fashion. We are still figuring out what powers are appropriate at each level, and because so many powers have been devolved to the scottish parliament, the british government would have very little to do if each other devolved administration had the same powers. It is possible we will see some powers being taken away from the scottish parliament, like its absolute control over education. It would make sense for the british parliament to influence some education policy to ensure uniformity across the country and allow each region's legislature some autonomy in addition to that. If we lock everything in place by federalising, making adjustments to what powers lie where as appropriate while we're still teething would be a lot more difficult.

The other issue is dissolving devolved legislatures and imposing direct rule, given that the British government has had the need to exercise this power a few times in the past (with the original Northern Ireland parliament and again with the NI assembly, and with some overseas territories) it would be foolish to take that ability away for the time being. I imagine countries like the US do have some procedures in place for dealing with state governments that are corrupt or ineffective and need urgent replacement so it could be something we could account for in a federal system, but it might take some time to work out the right deal that's agreed to by the government and the regions.

My preference would be for the UK to remain a unitary state divided into equivalently-sized and populated regions (really it would just be England that gets divided) each with their own assembly and the same level of powers. This wouldn't need to be formally federalised, but once the system's been running smoothly for a while we could consider making it a proper federal system.",0,1411249967,null,0,false,0,cknwdbo,t3_2gylzr,t1_cknwdbo,t3_2gylzr,null,1426903333,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'd describe the experience as being quaint. Clearly they're new to the game so check in took quite a while and baggage handling was slow at best. On the return journey they got the fire department to help with the unloading. They even had a buffet with wine and beer to commemorate the occasion.

It was a bit haphazard, but overall I think it was worth it considering the location. Even though things were slower than they should have been, compared to the bureuacracy you get in larger airports and the long drive (relatively speaking) it was pretty speedy. How did you find the service?

If they had a larger runway then I think they could do a little better for themselves. They own the field on the opposite side of Newmarket road so I always wondered if they'd be able to extend the runway over it and then sink the road underneath. That way they'd gain an extra 30% which would make flying larger planes more feasible.

That is not true.

First of all Spooz was several reddit accounts that would be used at the same time. My understanding is that at least some of the accounts were shadowbanned for it.

The first time Spooz banned me for no reason. He unbanned me when he found out he was wrong. I wasn't even posting in /r/Scotland at that point, but he decided I was some troll they had and banned me.

The second time he banned me...

Spooz responded to someone who called him out for shitposting and said he didn't give a fuck, and I called him a thundercunt for it.

On the same day he told me (wrongly as usual) to stop making shit up, and I called him a stupid prick.

That was all. It was not in private messages, it was all in the open. In each case Spooz was abusive first.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"Here's my humble take on why this season has started the way it has:

It was clear at the end of the 2013/14 season that Liverpool were the surprise team of the Premier League. Many fans, journalists and experts were surprised about how exceptionally well our team did. Many pointed towards the fact we were able to concentrate exclusively on the PL, especially in the second part of that season. Our #7 was mercurial in form and his quality was an undoubted added value to the team that finally found it's way under our recent (even if it may seem like he's been here for ages) managerial appointment. In the first part of the season nobody really expected much from Liverpool and despite a few unconvincing performances the points soon began to add up. Through the season LFC amassed an excellent haul only to narrowly miss on what has been eluding our team for way too long.

It was an excellent season. One to remember even if there was no silverware at the end of it. But it is in the past now and the 2014/15 season is well underway. And let's be honest, it's been slightly underwhelming. Perhaps we've been spoiled so quickly, perhaps it's simply too early in the season to be this critical ... but we all surely saw our team collect more points in the PL than they have. Many of the performances have been worrying. It is difficult to remain positive.

In my mind there are two major reasons for why this season has started the way it has. Firstly we are no longer the dark horses and Liverpool have made somewhat of a fool of a fair few teams last season. Nobody will want to risk the repeat of what happened to so many other teams in 2013/14 so that automatically means everyone is paying a lot more attention to what LFC had been/is doing and how to counter that. Simply put, most of the managers in the PL are payed to do a job and part of that job is getting results against the top teams when possible. Liverpool and BR's plan's have consequently been sussed out so to speak. 

The tried and tested method(s) also aren't producing the desired effect due to the amount of new players our squad now contains. It will take time for everyone to gel and get used to one another. For example, in the previous season Raheem Sterling knew exactly what to expect from the likes of Sturridge, Suarez, Coutinho, Henderson ... the core of our team. That core has been adjusted at the start of the season for various reasons and it is affecting every player in the current squad, not only RS. For me, this is the biggest reason why the season has started so poorly. Another example of this is today's substitution of Javier Manquillo in the first half. It was partly due to a major shift in the way our manager wanted to approach the match from that point on. Also (in my mind) it was because JM is not used to the type of game that was played out against the hosts today, West Ham. Physical, lots of tough challenges, our opposition set out to disrupt our game as a primary goal, scoring of goals came as a secondary objective. This was also plainly visible in the match against Aston Villa, where also many new recruits started the match. Manquillo, young as he is, isn't the only one who will have similar adaptability issues. This all points to the need to remain patient and focused on the work that is still to be done with our squad.

Liverpool need to move forward. Everyone needs to stick to the plan and remain focused and composed. The season has only just started. Sure we are out of the title race at this point. Of course it is going to be very tough to rejoin that race. Keep in mind however that this team was built for the future more than for the current season. This is the most important reason why I feel positive even after a result like today's or the one against Aston Villa. Sure (with all dues respect to Villa and the Hammers) we were expecting to beat those teams. Their ambition, organisation or even outlay in the transfer departments don't match the commitments Liverpool have made. 

Overall, the situation we as fans are in is not too different from when Brendan Rodgers first took over as the manager. With one big difference and one (I know how it reads but bear with me) rather minor one. Our results are at this point are better than they were at the start of 2012/13 season and instead of the Europa League we are playing Champions League. BR has already proven he has the ability to change up his plans and adapt to situations to improve his teams performance and set the squad on prolonged upward trajectories. On top of that he got to pick the team that has started this season. There have been some unfortunate injuries but the squad was prepared for that and even if not everything has evolved as desired up to this point, this does not mean we need to put our hopes to rest and start looking toward different options or even the next season.

The foundations are strong, the backbone of the team is still the same, even if not everyone is available right now or are in poor form. Rodgers has proven ability and he surely will come up with other plan(s) to move forward and improve on our current reality. The team has a lot more dept and arguably more quality than in recent years. Personally, I'm hoping for tweaks and minor adjustments, time for things to set and gel properly and a bit more fortune with player availability. Yes it's been deflating but keep the bigger picture in mind. There's a long term plan, the season has only just started and there are better things to come. Brendan's new long term deal and our recent recruits prove that.

true,teafaceisming,eu,Derby,"Well the work related group of ESA is meant to be there for these types of people, or at least in theory. The work workshops of ESA are 'meant' to try and get those with disabilities and illnesses ready to go to work.(Pushing those with mental health issues, especially anxiety and depression into these groups usually has the opposite effect.) But as argued below it is very unlikely for this woman to find work, also it would be a struggle to keep up with the demands of JSA with her disability. Although the DWP probably, depending on the advisor and the weather or whatever else effects the staff's frame of mind on that day would accommodate her disability 'properly'; though they are legally bound to make it so a jobseeker can complete the steps in their condition. 

To be honest most Job Centre advisors probably wouldn't want the hastle of trying to make special considerations in JSA and would just turn this woman away and tell her to claim ESA.

Anyway, just because you are on ESA shouldn't mean you should have to 'sit at home' but trying to find any paid work flexible enough for a lot of people with disabilities may be very difficult. Obviously the big thing is that the benefits are really quite low compared to low-decent full time wages so in effect a blind woman may be stuck in a position where they never had a chance to climb the ladder the 'none disabled' have a shot at. And essentially are stuck in a form of poverty. But fundementally, that money and flexability of ESA needs to be there just as much as the flexibility of work places they may go in to.

Finally I think this woman will get her ESA reinstated, if this doesn't make it on the mandatory reconsideration stage it will go through on the appeal stage. The worst thing is this process may leave her without money for long periods of time and add a lot of uncertainty and worry on her shoulders. It is infuriating to see people who are genuinely disabled have to jump through these hoops and are literally left to the wolves. Once your ESA stops, your Housing Benefits and Council Tax reduction goes too. Hello rent arrears, hello debts! The most heartbreaking cases are mental health cases because this process is literally the worst thing that could happen to them. Grr! I will add that as long as they appeal and are succesful they will often be back payed as long as they are advised to ask for it, but that doesn't help debts that have stacked up alongside their current living.

Don't get me started on the 'medical' assessments. I think 0's are just a staple for them. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a quota. They use everything against you, people are often bashful about how bad a situation they are in and some people are fine one day but cannot move another. For example some people with sleep disorders can sleep solidly for 3 days. And this can happen at any time. Or if you have osteoarthritis, some days you may be able to walk with a walking stick or sit for longer periods but half of days you are in such pain you have to lye down flat on your back, to at least bay that pain.

Personally, I don't think top 4 is the end of the world like some others do, and missing out is certainly not the automatic sacking that some are suggesting. We have a young squad that we should be able to keep together going into next year if we only finish 5th, and so if we're close to the top 4 and just miss out, I could live with that.

Obviously no manager's bullet proof. If results become horrendous and we're well of the pace of Europe then yeah I'd entertain talk of sacking then. But that's the sort of talk that happens around March. Not the middle of fucking September.

What annoys me though is how everyone seems well up for the patient and understanding approach before the season starts- ""yeah we've got to give the new players time"", ""yeah the league is really competitive""- and then we actual lose a few and everyone fucking freaks out, like they forgot part of being patient is that results and performances aren't always rosy.",0,1411251694,null,0,false,0,cknx2kw,t3_2gywhn,t1_cknx2kw,t1_cknwo90,null,1426903006,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Pick a style and a formation and stick with it.  Then buy players who suit that.  Instead, we've randomly bought a lot of players none of whom are bad, but none of whom really fit together either or at least not all at the same time in any way that makes sense.

true,QggOne,null,null,"&gt; And what if that 11 billion stopped coming? Genuine question. 

Nothing at first. The politicians would argue between themselves as they always have. Expenditure would continue with small reductions. That would create a massive economic bomb waiting to go off sometime in the near future. Once it does explode in our faces the government will be bankrupt. Our only option would be to request a loan from other countries.

&gt; Is it fair to say that this deficit exists in part because Northern Ireland lives beyond its means?

It's not really like that. It’s much a much more complex issue. We waste a lot of money because we elect some idiotic politicians and we need those idiotic politicians because they keep bigger threats a bay. The politicians, who are separated along a sectarian divide (big surprise) spend an awful lot of time either trying to get one up on the other half or pushing personal agenda’s that are useless.

&gt; Why is the public sector bloated here? How do we change that?

The public sector is large because the private sector is not picking up the slack. And the private sector is not picking up because foreign investment into the area is low. Northern Ireland is a risky place to invest. Foreigners still wonder if we might go back to blowing each other up again. Everytime we make the news for riots or a pipe bomb we make ourselves less viable for investment.

So the big question is, how do we move Northern Ireland away from its past and towards a future made brighter by its people and not by a burning car in the background. How do we eliminate paramilitary attitudes whilst keeping ourselves out of the news? This is not an easy task.

Fostering a unified identity would definitely be useful. If we are all working together then there’s no need to fight. Fostering a Northern Irish identity might be helped by creating a new flag or our own national anthem but this has met hard resistance from both unionist and republican camps. Neither the unionist nor the republican parties are willing to support it because they might lose votes or it might push the paramilitaries back to their old ways. It’s hard to fault the politicians logic in this matter.

If we push for a local Northern Irish identity too quickly it might antagonise the extremist republicans and unionists and then bombs start going off. If we move to slowly the UK might take action over Northern Ireland, and who knows what they might do. The British government has badly managed the whole situation far too many times.

Rather than push for a new identity we could always just try and get the communities more accustomed to being around each other. The number of Protestants I talked to before university could be counted on one hand. If I had have got a local job and not went to university then it’s quite likely I would not have a single friend from a protestant community, a community that makes up around 50% of this country’s population. That’s insane! How do you force integration of the two communities? Richard Dawkins suggested mixed schooling buuuuut it’s near impossible to mix the schools. The communities often have geographical separations meaning the so-called mixed schools might not be mixed at all. In areas where communities are geographically close, parents will protest to the local government and the local government will listen. The protest will end up in the news and Northern Ireland will lose more investment.

Northern Ireland has a number of catch 22 problems as you may have noticed. 

Some of the politicians have been pushing the tourism angle and it’s not a bad choice. Giving film companies like HBO (hello Game of Thrones) cash incentives to film here has been useful. It creates jobs and gives Northern Ireland an identity for something other than sectarian violence. We have invested in the Titanic museum. The jury is out on how that will work out. I’m trying to be optimistic about it.

My summation? I have no solutions. I apologise for the waffling in these paragraphs. I think 200 years of peace will heal Northern Ireland. Time and understanding is what we need...also that Westminster cash. We definitely need that Westminster cash.

No, because after a year of employment with this ""free"" labour the business could well be strong enough again to fully employ those 325 people, when otherwise they'd be sat on benefits going nowhere and the company wouldn't have had access to their skills in that time to keep delivering and ideally making money. It could even be worse - maybe the company can't afford to keep those 325 people, but without them, the company would collapse. So you're paying for 325 jobs but saving 1,000.

true,VahnRPG,null,null,"Not sure my opinion on this episode. I think it was good, but I guess it was alright, actually I think I hated it.

It seemed very predictable (what? you mean those things that did a star trek-esque teleport effect were teleporters and *not* suicide capsules?! color me shocked) and it seemed like they were rushing the ending (big big story to get into the vault taking up most of the episode, shut up sequence, bad guy isn't really a bad guy, preview, credits), like they had 60 minutes of story they were trying to compress to 45, which seems a little typical of the moffet era.

Actually....yeah, the more I think about the episode the more it annoys me.

* Once past this super-secure bank security system and you actually look into the inner workings of the thing and it's a basically a steel mill with some cubby drawers that aren't even locked and a pretty front?
* On top of that, this super-secure bank has vent shafts built into it that four people can comfortably walk around in. And absolutely no guards around where stuff should be, you know, looked after?
* Clara contributed absolutely nothing, so why was she brought along? I get that she's the Doctor's companion and all that but....still, what's she around for? She didn't seem to be giving any moral stability to the Doctor after all...
* The Doctor can obviously go through the trouble of setting all this up before he even actually goes there, actually that's probably what he was getting to after Clara left at the end, so why did any of the others even need to go along? Why didn't he just, you know, release the monster &amp; its mate and job well done when he was there setting everything up?
* And if he went back to the past to set everything up, was the one guy who got melted there on purpose? But then it was mentioned that the guy who got melted in the beginning wasn't the intruder and it was 4 other people that broken in so he was blamed for being near the others when they got into the bank?
* So, that makes me seriously question the Doctor. Either 1) he picked a person he knew was innocent to take the fall for them, in which case the Doctor is clearly no longer one of the ""good guys""; 2) he picked a person he knew was guilty of something else, dressed them up, and had him take the fall, in which case the doctor is reminding me of ""Lind L Tailor"" scene from Death Note; or 3) he set everything up in the future knowing what he knows and let an innocent man get fried for the sake of ""the plot,"" in which case he is becoming evil due to apathy.
* They obviously have no way to tell when the monster is picking up recent/current guilt versus *any* kind of guilt, and the chick just smiles at the notion of melting some possibly innocent dude's brain? That's....that's just cold, man.
* The doctor said that he knew what the capsule was to the one woman, but doesn't actually say what it is. The she gets got by the monster, and doesn't even think to tell her that it was a teleporter? Which makes his later ""surprise"" at them not being dead being fake? In watching that scene again something did feel off about that bit for him.

Dammit, I hate that the moffet era I just nitpick the episodes to death...

true,brynlaaa,null,null,"I personally don't understand the decision to play with Skrterl. Sakho and Lovren were both bought by Rodgers, he needs to give them time to gel. The mistakes will go away once the back FOUR have had a chance to play together, week in, week out. It seemed like a knee-jerk reaction when we didn't actually defend that badly vs Villa barring set pieces. 

Let's face it, the reason we did so well last season was largely due to Suarez and Sturridge's goals making up for our defence. We don't have Suarez now so we obviously need to sort the defence (Sturridge coming back will be a big help, as a sidenote). However, I don't see how it'll ever sort itself if BR sticks Skrtel in as soon as he comes back from injury. On top of that, despite his goals last season, the fact is that Skrtel is an absolute liability at the back so I think he needs to stick with the same CB pairing. It can't be easy for Lovren joining a new team to keep playing with a difference central defensive partner. 

I also think its time to start phasing Stevie out. **Before people start down voting me I'm not saying he should never start nor am I saying he's shit.** What I am saying though is that he is getting older - obviously. He doesn't offer as much to us defensively as others do. The position he plays requires a whole load of running when we're on the backfoot, and he's just not go the legs for it now. A midfield three of Allen, Henderson and Lallana/Coutinho behind Sterling, with Mario/Sturridge up top, is probably going to be our strongest lineup. 

Lastly (rant nearly over), Mignolet really needs some serious competition. He's making too many mistakes and I don't think a top class keeper can get away with JUST being a good shot stopper. He seems to have no command over his area which I think puts doubt into Lovren, Sakho and Skrtel's minds. That first goal today he should have been coming out to punch it clear. Even if he fucked it up him coming out might have put Tomkins off... And what the hell was he doing for the second goal?! I know it was a cross and not a shot but where was he standing?! 

I admire Borini's attitude and willingness to stay but he's just not good enough for us. I'm VERY much looking forward to getting Sturridge back.

I know that 93% of the oil and gas reserves still remaining (in terms of value) are in Scottish waters. However, as Scotland isn't a sovereign state in its own right, I don't even know if ""Scottish waters"" even exists, legally speaking (maybe somebody can enlighten me, if they know). I'm probably biased given that I'm Scottish, but my inclination is that tax revenues generated on oil and gas extracted from the Scottish sector of the North Sea should be treated as taxes generated in Scotland; it is piped directly to Scotland, and AFAIK a large majority of those working in the industry are Scottish (obviously backing this up with figures would be difficult). 

&gt; In the union, we should be happy to accept wealth transfers to places that need it

I completely agree in this respect, which is why I don't mind so much that some of Scotland's tax revenue has been spent elsewhere in the UK (if North Sea is included, as you pointed out). Resisting this transfer of funds is pretty ridiculous, because otherwise smaller and smaller parts of the country with very healthy economies would start objecting that their tax revenues are being spent elsewhere to subsidize poorer areas. For instance if all the tax revenue generated in the City of London were spent there, they'd probably end up with gold-coated lamp-posts.

Let’s preserve our Union in law to stop the SNP pulling it apart, Jack Straw

The United Kingdom may be unbalanced. But, hey, it works

Now that Scotland has decisively spoken, after a campaign whose terms were set by the SNP for itself, we should follow the example of stable federated countries (the US and India, for example) and say: “This Union is now indissoluble.”

If independence would have been for good, so must the decision to stay. You can’t pull a living plant up by the roots again and again, and expect it to survive. Put this commitment to the Union in primary Westminster legislation. Of course, that could be changed but only by all the UK’s MPs. “Better Together” must mean what it says.

The promises of further devolution to Scotland will be honoured, and the settlements for Wales and Northern Ireland are being strengthened. Where does that leave England? Proposals for “English votes for English laws” are sedulously attractive. They have been repeated by David Cameron. However, I suggest that we English take a deep breath and examine whether they are remotely necessary, and even if they are, just how they would be put into practice.

This West Lothian question is, in truth, code for an assertion about Labour — that in government we have to rely on Scottish MPs for a majority. I am proud that Labour really is a unionist party (as were the Conservatives until their fateful decision in 1987 to use Scotland as a laboratory for the poll tax). But almost always, when we win a general election, we win south of the border as well.

In 32 years of Labour governments since the war, Labour has had to “rely” on Scottish MPs to remain in power for just 26 months (1964 to 1966 and March to October 1974). That’s including Welsh Labour MPs. But we also had more English MPs than the Conservatives throughout the Blair/Brown administrations, as well as in the 1966 and October 1974 elections.

The unique characteristic of this Union is that one component — England — has 84 per cent of the population. England’s population is projected to grow over the next 20 years by another 7 million — more than Scotland’s population of 5.3 million. This means that almost every issue that may look exclusive to England can have knock-on effects for the rest of the UK. Take the 2004 increase in tuition fees. It applied directly to England and Wales only. But its indirect effect went north of the border. The greater reliance on private funding of universities south of the border indirectly reduced the block grant to Scotland. Scottish MPs thus had a wholly legitimate stake in the outcome.

English votes for English laws has been tried before. Gladstone’s second Irish Home Rule Bill of 1893 came up with the “ins and outs solution”, in which Irish MPs at Westminster were to be able to vote on “imperial” matters, but not “domestic” ones. It was the Tory leader, AJ Balfour, who exposed its fundamental defects. The system, he said, “would carry the most serious evils in its train”. It would “threaten the ordinary procedure of parliament” and “shatter the cabinet system . . . if you never knew whether an issue was going to be identified as English-only or the UK as a whole”. After months of wrangling, Gladstone conceded. As Sir Malcolm Rifkind observed in 2006, creating “two classes of MP would be a constitutional abortion”.

If we now make a reality of devolution within England — where the real democratic deficit lies — and ensure a fairer share of the cake between the southeast and, for example, the north and northwest, much of the apparent attraction of two classes of MP will go. It’s certainly worth examining whether there’d be any role for an English grand committee to discuss “English” legislation but I suspect that even this might be more trouble than it was worth.

We do not, however, need to tie ourselves in knots about this. Politicians have a constant care for popular support. We’ve all learnt the excruciating lesson from the Conservatives’ “Scottish poll tax” debacle. We English should stop fretting. The Union, our Union, has been saved. It’s “asymmetrical”, it’s untidy. But, hey, it works.

I've just had a look at the public spending figures by region and country, and the South East (not including London) receives £7,638 per capita while Scotland recieves £10,152 per capita. The South East receives less per head than any other region of the UK. Obviously it would be unfair to use Scotland's economic performance as a reason for us receiving more money, because the South East's economic performance (in terms of GVA per capita) is greater. Perhaps there does need to be a better distribution of funds from region to region so that economically weaker areas get the amount of money the need, while also trying not to penalize the economically stronger areas (I'm not even sure this is entirely possible).

With regards to free prescriptions and no student fees, these are policies created by the Scottish parliament using funds from their budget, which consists of a block grant from Westminster and some minor tax revenues from other sources. In order to deliver these policies, funds have had to be cut from elsewhere (for instance, local authorities have taken large cuts, the number of further education posts have been cut, and our NHS is not ringfenced as it is in England). Student fees are undeniably a massive expense on the government, but prescription fees are different. Prescriptions in England are free for the elderly, children and those on benefits. These three groups account for quite a big majority (I don't have the exact figure) of prescriptions and so extending this offer to everyone isn't at that great a cost. Tuition fees shouldn't be free in my opinion, as it is only fair for people to share some of the burden of an education which will almost invariably lead to better job prospects and a higher income in the long term. It was Labour who introduced the tuition fees, and the coalition who tripled them, and I think most people in Scotland would accept that this is unfair.

1- Eccleston is a serious actor, a pro.  When he signed up, it was a huge get for the show.   I would say that 60% of the first seasons episodes were crap but Eccleston brought a real heat to those roles and you bought him as the fractured reluctant double genocider.   Eccleston's performance gave the show real heart, a hear that Tennant and Smith basically ran with (no disrespect to them).

2- even a crappy as most of those scripts and certainly the special effects are they are timeless and a perfectly valid entry for new Doctor Who fans. 

3- Eccleston saw things in that first season that basically ruined the experience.  Part of being a pro is to work in an environment that is conductive to giving a great performance.  When unnamed senior officials are treating tradespeople like crap, you staying essentially tolerates that.  

4- finally, it has been almost ten years.  Have you seen him recently?  He doesn't really look like the 9th doctor anymore.  Obviously a dye job and a leather jacket will help but it would be jarring to the audience.  There is something timeless about that first season and something special about him not wanting to come back.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"The debate is very confused. It certainly is true that with regards to the Barnett formula Scotland's population is over-represented. However AFAIK that formula is only used to calculate adjustments to public expenditure and not the base level. 

But on to your question, [here's one article](http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/public-spending-per-head-in-scotland-revealed-1-3197170) that talks about public expenditur from a hopefully non-biased source which confirms that per head Scotland does receive more than the UK average of public expenditure. 

However that 'subsidy' is either exactly balanced or over-compensated for by the fact that per head Scots raise more tax partly because salaries are marginally higher on average in Scotland and partly because oil revenues are included. The treasury doesn't include those because it treats oil as separate from any part of the UK economy whereas if you include it in the Scottish economy you get the figure's you posted, OP. So naturally the Daily Mail and the other less than tactful news sources will chose not to include oil revenue and declare it a Scottish subsidy whereas the SNP will include it as naturally Scottish. 

From my own perspective if The City can call it's services sector its own despite the fact that its half made up of foreign banks and foreign money then Scotland has every right to call the oil, that happens to be off its shores by geographic luck, Scottish and perhaps the Treasury should think about keeping more oil revenue in Scotland. However I would like to see someone try and argue that Scotland should be able keep all of it's oil revenues but London-generated wealth from finance should be spread around and spent in Scotland. Incidentally independence campaigners are the least likely to fall foul of that little hypocrisy which is good news for people who decide to believe that England pays a subsidy to Scotland as OP describes.

However as oil revenue decreases over the next 20-40 years even into the next decade then that argument about oil revenues justifying higher public spending will no longer hold water. Either Scotland needs to find alternative sources of revenue to maintain current public spending for the next few decades or it must cut down in line with England.

The problem with affluent areas (I use this term loosley as I appreciate that this affluence is often very restricted, as you say) is that the demand for houses  from those that can easily afford them inflates the house prices overall, and those that suffer are the ones with the lowest incomes. Cornwall is a classic example, where the influx of people buying second homes means that locals literally cannot afford to buy, not helped by the fact that employment there is sometimes seasonal. The same thing happens in the Highlands in Scotland, and in Fife (with Edinburgh commuters), albeit on a smaller scale.

What I find worrying is that the poorest people in Scotland went out to vote Yes, mostly because the current system is doing them no favours and they want something better. They might take the No vote as a message that people don't really care about them, which I don't think is true.",0,1411257416,null,0,false,0,cknzecp,t3_2gz91f,t1_cknzecp,t1_cknyxjy,null,1426901920,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,DangerouslyCheesey,null,null,"He got away with it for long stretches last year for a couple of reasons.  First, teams had to fear Sturridge and Suarez getting in behind them.  The opposing back line playing deep means more midfield room and time for him on the ball.  That has not been the case the last few games and was not today.  Two, he didn't start with Lucas very many times last season.  With players who will run for him in front, his liabilities are not as exposed.  Three, we put so many teams to the sword early on in the match, and we were able to recover from repeated errors with more goals - see the 5-3 game (stoke?) and several other similar matches.  Fourth, with no CL and relatively early cup exists, he only had to play a single match a week by the midpoint of the season.

We don't have the luxury of Stevie sitting deep, dwelling on the ball and lobbing 50 yard passes to the premier leagues two top scoring strikers.  He and Lucas in that midfield were absolutely the weak link, and failed to provide the kind of cover that a new back line needs to gel.

By the same logic the City of London is not the City of London's. It's the jewel in Britain's financial crown and as a whole country we have helped create it. London is the most multicultural city in the world [citation needed] and Scotland has contributed to it's success in no small part and London depends on all of the UK.

So by the same logic I don't want London's wealth ringfenced for London, I don't think the oil should be ringfenced for Scotland.

I also think that more money should be spent in Scotland because it needs spent where the poverty lies, and where remote rural access is required. 

I also think it makes sense to have tremendously good infrastructure in London to make sure it can make as much tax money for the UK as possible.

So I'm as opposed to London greed as I am to oil greed. We are a United Kingdom and we should be allocating our resources where they are best spent.

On a slight contrast I also believe in regional government/federalisation. So I think it should be done in the way that it is done in Scotland. Money comes to the government from the UK as a whole dependent on need - poverty, land area, etc. And the same settlement should be made for all parts of the UK.

true,dyytto,null,null,"Regarding our attack, there seems to be barely any fluidity to the build-up of Liverpool's game. Sure they pass around a lot between the back four but when the ball arrives at Gerrard's foot opponents begin to surround and pressure him off the ball, causing him to misplace his pass which is vital to our style of play. You see how he normally distributes the ball over to the wingers with his pinpoint accurate passes but today he lacked exactly that and in addition to that, his set-pieces have been below par as well. It is also necessary to mention how his positioning was partly the reason to why we conceded the third goal.

I feel this is because he's been playing too many games and Rodgers hasn't given him enough rest which really shows when he plays. And the problem is, this is how Liverpool sets up all theirs games. **Their system revolves around Gerrard's passing.** It is so crucial that his passes make it to our wingers or fullbacks at the final third because that's how we slice through opponent's defenses (not the only way of course). Unfortunately, the skipper wasn't having a good game and that diminished our attacking threat. Truth be told, if Gerrard has a bad game, Liverpool will have a bad game. He's that important to us, and if we want to win games, we need him to be in top form in every single match we play, but that's impossible because now we have UCL to worry about. He's 34 and he's giving everything he has into this club but Rodgers needs to know when to give him a rest. I know very well that sitting him out will leave a huge hole in our team but as much as it pains me to say this, we need to learn to survive without him. That's the only way I can see Liverpool progressing. It's time that Rodgers create a system that doesn't rely heavily on Gerrard because at the end of the day, he will have to retire. 

Regarding Mignolet in particular, I think everyone generally knows that Mignolet is in the worst form he's ever been in a Liverpool shirt and I expect Rodgers to personally deal with this matter because it's so apparent that our shot-stopper's been lacking competition and motivation. Worse comes to worst, Jones should be called for the next few games or so to remind Mignolet that in his current form, he does not deserve his place in the starting eleven.

Regarding our defense, our defenders really need to communicate. Lovren's head injury could've been so easily avoided if either one of him or Sakho shouted out for the ball. The defensive coaches really have a lot of work to do because our set-piece defending is currently dismal! At this point, I'd be happier getting a defensive coach than I would getting a new player because if there's a system to which Liverpool's defense is based on, it sure as hell is not working. Skrtel, Sakho and Lovren are all world-class centrebacks; they've already proven that. Now all they need to do is gel well with each other and hopefully, we can see improvements in the near future.

This is definitely not Liverpool at their best. It'll take time for us to reach to the levels of last season but us as fans need to have faith in our team and support them through these rough times.

This is an interesting thing I've been thinking about a bit. 

Part of the Yes campaign was saying how Scotland is worse off being in the Union, because some of the money from oil is diverted to the rest of the UK. They argued that Scotland would be better off independent, because *all* that money would go to Scotland, the country closest to which it is pumped.

Another angle of the Yes campaign was that Scotland is more left wing than the rest of the UK, therefore people would be better represented with those left wing views with independence. 

Now, I thought one fairly important left wing idea is that if someone has more, they should contribute more to society. That is why we have higher percentage taxes on higher incomes and richer people, and why many left wing people argue for even higher taxes on richer people. I'm sure this is also a view many in Scotland take. 

Surely, then, this is a central hypocrisy in the Yes campaign, and the calls from many Scots in the No camp for more power over this oil money. On the one hand, they complain about the rest of the UK being more right wing, but then show a very right wing ideology of 'I've got mine and I don't want to share' over the oil.",0,1411258206,null,0,false,0,cknzpmy,t3_2gz91f,t1_cknzpmy,t1_cknwblz,null,1426901773,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

It's all very complicated, but essentially there is Group Lotus, who make the road cars, and Lotus f1. Lotus F1 *used* to be sponsored by Group, but aren't anymore and the name is just a hangover. They have no relationship whatsoever. 

Caterham used to be *Team* Lotus, and inherited the F1 history, but Group didn't like it, so it went to court. Team won, but decided to give it up anyway as Group were sponsoring the old Renault team to become Lotus F1 (as opposed to the F1 team called Team Lotus), and no one liked that there were two teams called Lotus running at the same time. They were referred to as 'Good Lotus' (Team Lotus, now Caterham) and 'Evil Lotus' (Lotus F1, formally Renault). 

So Team Lotus bought Caterham Cars and became Caterham. Lotus F1 continued as Lotus F1, but then a year later Group Lotus (owned in Malaysia) decided to pull all sponsorship. Lotus F1 (the current Lotus in F1, owned by Genii Capital, formerly Evil Lotus, formerly Renault) decided to keep the Lotus name out of embarrassment at the whole furore more than anything else. They have nothing to do with Lotus at all.

I'm not sure funding works the same way there. Societies can apply for up to £400 a year from the university union ALONE if they're ratified and get enough interest. That's why they try to cut down and compartmentalise hobbies. The Sci-Fi and Fantasy society is a product of that - we absorbed the LARP, bridge, and gaming societies over the last 20 years for mutual benefit.

I won't tell you how much funding we could allocate the E-Sports contingent if you joined us, but it would be more than sufficient. We could give you a committee position and you could run basically autonomously with our resources behind you.

In fact, as any Scottish Nationalist will happily tell you, it was the Treasury that helped to invent a new extra-territorial category of national output for North Sea oil, in the 1970s. Treasury statisticians will tell you it made sense to keep the oil sector separate from the broader UK economy. Mr Salmond will tell you it was a Whitehall plot to steal the oil from the Scots.

If you google it you might be able to find more information on why the treasury thought it made sense in the 70s to keep Scotland and the oil sectors as separate statistics. One might presume it was because the oil revenues had the potential to make the Scottish economy really lopsided if revenues became very high but I don't know much about that.

So far though, it seems to be a lot more well-written, and the lack of romance between the Doctor and the companion (compared to Smith's era) is welcome, and probably contributes a lot to the plots being more memorable and streamlined.

Personally, I think the best episodes so far are Time Heist and Robots of Sherwood.

One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country. Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the ""bagmen"", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.""

* When there is no dominant regional ethnicity (which would rule through majoritarianism, or be blocked from doing so, creating resentment and gridlock)

Hmm. Stand out customers. Well, the best thing today was an old woman bought me a bar of Galaxy. Obviously I tried to refuse it, but it's useless, she buys me chocolate every once in a while, and she never takes no for an answer.

Another guy asked me if I'm American, he reckoned my accent sounded American. I told him no, I'm actually a brummie, and he walked away wordlessly. So that was pretty weird.

This one wasn't technically at work, but it was a customer. This old guy, who once slapped my arse while I was at work, decided to punch my arm when I got on the bus yesterday. Think he was just trying to get my attention, but maybe punching me wasn't the best way to go about doing that.

There's the guy who's currently plying his alcoholic stepson with as much alcohol as he can, now that he knows he's dying as a result of his alcoholism, to try and ""get rid of him as soon as possible"". That one's pretty fucked up.

Accidentally googling things is totally possible, I once accidentally googled Texas. Child porn seems a *little* more difficult to accidentally google, though.

Once had a smack head hold up a multipack of Space Raiders, tell me that was his dinner, and then ask me out. I said no, obviously, and he insisted that *he is single!* Like it was my disbelief that such a *catch* could be single that was holding me back. He also wrote a love letter to one of the other girls that works there on the back of a letter from the job centre.

A guy once said *absolutely nothing* to me, but handed me a piece of paper and walked off. When I looked at it he'd written his number, and in all caps, ""TEXT ME"". No thanks, mate.

There's my stalker, who spent a few months showing up literally everywhere I went, before spending about 2 months asking me out every time he saw me. I would've thought ""nah, I'm good"" would've tipped him off to the fact that I wasn't interested, but apparently not.

I'm also still annoyed that the local paper wrote that I was left ""shaken by my ordeal"" after the time I was *briefly* put in a headlock during a robbery.

This is actually intended to give countries influence in direct proportion to their population.  Read up on the [Penrose square root law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_square_root_law) if you are interested in knowing why it achieves that, though the voting weights in the European Council don't follow the values motivated by that rule exactly, as everything in the EU is decided by complicated negotiations and horse trading.

&gt; Much rather each country just getting a set-even number of representatives.

You keep saying that throughout the thread, but there really doesn't seem to be any reasoning behind it other than ""well, that's how it works in my awesome country"".  One very obvious problem with this, if you are at all familiar with UK politics, is that Northern Ireland, with 3% of the UK's population, would get a quarter of the seats.  The two largest parties in Northern Ireland are the [DUP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party), who are completely insane, and [Sinn Féin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in), who take part in UK national elections but refuse to take up the seats they win.

If we were going to do anything like this, you would have to split England up into multiple regions, probably the nine regions used for European elections.  Otherwise it would just seem grossly unfair, would give far too much influence to the DUP, and would be extremely vigorously opposed by the Tories, who would struggle to win many seats in both Scotland and Wales.",0,1411263600,null,0,false,0,cko1vdy,t3_2gy3ct,t1_cko1vdy,t1_cknv3x8,null,1426900695,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Again punishment without prevention is worthless near enough. You need to have the deterrent and you need to have a punishment but you also must fix the problem, especially in jail however that is expensive (and prisoners are already an unwanted expense!). We should not have to rely on charities to try and cut down on addiction!

As for jailing someone for not paying fines, TV licences and so on, it takes a long long time of refusing to pay to be sent to jail and even then its for a very short time (which is an issue as people will rather go to jail for a few days to wipe out several unpaid fines as they are all served concurrently, the record being 51 at once!) In 2012 there were like 3 people jailed for fine defaulting. We need to be able to take it out of benefits which would prevent jail costs but apparently that's against human rights innit.

The legal system in NI is fairly good as is but could be a whole lot better and cheaper with some common sense and upfront costs but its easier for it to continue on as is.

It's not just defending set-pieces, but defense in general. Basic concepts seem to be glossed over, things such as, once the zone is broken or abandoned, people need to get on man coverage and stick with their man (the giant whiff by Moreno because he was hesitant to enter someone else's zone, until he realized Lovren wasn't going to get it).

There's a lot of communications issues between Lovren and Sakho, which there really shouldn't as both of them can speak French and English fluently, same as with Mignolet. 
 
Another thing I don't understand is how flat we are while passing and how hard the passes are. For some reason we never seem to try to get leading passes (except for the occasional long ball) and when we do pass, it's almost always directly at their feet and as hard as they can. I don't get this philosophy at this level of competition. This is something that high school and college's do because their kids don't have the talent to play better, but these are professionals.

It's clear that not only is Mignolet struggling for confidence and form, but the defence know it. They don't trust him, and it breeds uncertainty. He should be bossing them around, telling them where to stand in the area, which balls to go for, and fucking poleaxing anyone who comes for the same ball as him. 

The cross for the first goal shouldn't have even made it to Tomkins, a confident, aggressive keeper swallows that without fuss 9 times out of 10. He could probably have made an effort to save the third, rather than standing still and watching it go past.

I suspect part of the blame lies at John Achterberg's door, he basically went straight from the Tranmere team to our reserve goalkeeper coach, to first-team goalkeeper coach when Valero fucked off with Rafa.

We need a horrible, intimidating bastard of a keeper who isn't afraid to boss people around and dominate his area. Someone who can play, and perhaps has a touch of insanity to him. Valdes, while unquestionably talented, is only 6'0 and is coming off a serious injury.

I'm quite disappointed we didn't go for Diego Lopez, he'd have been perfect. 6'5, good with his feet, dominant in the air, vocal... He was Real Madrid's #1 for a year, someone who kept Casillas out of the team, he performed brilliantly despite all the shit the media threw at him.

Our squad has changed and Rodgers is trying a lot of different combinations of players and formations. This testing period has been prolonged because of injuries to players both in preseason and in the early stages of the premier league. We know Liverpool are still capable of performances like the 3-0 against spurs, we absolutely dismantled a Tottenham side who had started the season in a promising fashion. We also already know that we have the ability to grind out difficult wins (Ludogorets and Saints). In short, don't worry... YET. There is a distinct possibility that we will ""do a spurs"" this season but the time to make that proclamation isn't just yet.

I'm not even saying that his disagreements with the BBC were invalid.  Billie Piper and Noel Clark worked with the same people and they stayed.  Sorry if I don't believe the BBC singled out the actor playing the Doctor (and none of the other cast members) enough that he had to leave the franchise and never return for no reason.

1) Definitely.  He played the hell out of the role and he's great in the other things I've seen.

2) I actually don't think they were that bad! I don't mind bad special effects on the show.  It's part of the charm!

3) Completely agree.

4) Eh, actually, I haven't seen him recently.  I mean I guess you make a good point in that it would be really jarring to see him back.  I saw someone say Smith and Tennant were opposite sides of the same coin.  Then again, how long was it between Davison's last episode and the ""Time Crash"" short?  His appearance was *way* different. 

All that said, it would be great to see him back.  It just seems to me like he wasn't that into it.

And then getting from Slough to Tottenham by train will require you to take one train from Slough to Paddington, then the Underground from Paddington to either King's Cross for the Victoria Line to Seven Sisters, or to Liverpool Street for a train to White Hart Lane station. If you go to Seven Sisters, it's then a 20-30 minute walk.

BR came in and put Suarez in a position and a team set up that took a very good player and made him into one of the top 5 in the world. You think he would have done so well playing off Andy Caroll's shoulder while wingers hoofed the ball into the box? When BR came into the team Sterling was a talented but troublesome 17 year old that very nearly was sent out on loan. Sturridge was brought in at a cut rate price because of a bad attitude and his unwillingness to work well with others. Coutinho was an undersized brazilian with quick feet but no real playing time in Italy. If you don't see BR's value in getting all of these players to step up then we are both wasting our time here. 

Last year's net spend was 34M GBP. There is no replacement for Suarez and BR didn't even try. Balotelli is one of the most talented players in the world. If BR can work the same improvement in him he will be a 50M GBP player in a couple of years. LFC are a deep and talented team that need time and fan support.

If you have to fly in the day of keep in mind that the earliest a flight can land at Heathrow is 6am (having been stuck on a plane circling off the coast at 5.30am and not being permitted to land i know this for a fact), you will want to get in as early as possible. 

Good news, if you can get the flight that lands at 6am then Border Control is a breeze...at that time of the morning i have found it actually takes significantly longer to wait for any baggage then it does to clear Border Control. Would guess if you hit Heathrow at 6am you would be clear by 6.30-45am (i have been through as short as 20 min from getting of the plane to clearing Border Control at that time in the morning) depending on how many other flights are getting in at that time.

Then you can take a train out to Slough, there will be signs everywhere for the trains...just follow them. I think the earliest train out will probably be 5.30am or so....you will probably have to change trains to get to Slough so you will probably need to go Heathrow to Paddington (i think...it could be Waterloo, but i want to say Paddington.) and then Paddington to Slough....will probably take 60-90 minutes or so. 

Slough to WHL....i think you would have to take the train into one of the major stations, switch to the tube and then change again to the rail get to WHL station or you could take the tube to Seven Sisters and walk to WHL (its like a mile or so)....either way will probably take you 90min or more to get in.

You can do it but it....but you will be knackered. Plus if there is a delay on your flight or if there is a delay on any of the trains (happens all the time) you will probably be cutting it close.

You misunderstand a few of the player's roles; Balotelli's job here is to protect the near post and attack any ball within his vicinity, so he's done everything right here, and since Lucas has a similar 'cleaning-up' role on the edge of the box it is Skrtel's responsibility to either take the free man, or, failing that, to effectively position himself for the second ball to recover. He did neither of these things and he is very much at fault for this goal. 

In this defensive situation Skrtel should ALWAYS have a man, only our weaker arial defensive players should cover an area. Take a look at our other defensive corners and it should become clear, through his man to man (NOT zonal) marking style, what Skrtel's instructions are. He's a centre back and so if you play a hybrid defensive system like we do, you had better believe he's instructed to man mark. 
Also, you mention that Skrtel is pointing to Tomkins, but you're actually wrong there. Henderson is pointing to Reid (or the free space) because he knows Skrtel is out of position.

Sturridge never had a bad attitude and was never unwilling to work with others, that is just entirely incorrect.  Go look at what the likes of Coyle have said about him, you simply couldn't be more wrong.

Coutinho didn't get much playing time because, as we are seeing now, he's always been massively inconsistent.

I don't care how much we spent net, that's for FSG to worry about.  What matters is Rodgers has spent a hell of a lot of money and the team is now 'his'.  If the results aren't there, then there are no excuses to be had.

And no way is Balotelli one of the most talented players in the world.  I thought he was massively overrated at City and I think he's massively overrated now.  Sturridge is a far, far better all around player.

Overall, I'm not worried about it much because there is literally nothing I can do anyway.  Hopefully something clicks into place and kicks on, but so far this season has been pretty dreadful, there is no way around that.  We look like rank amateurs out there- no dribbling, passing sucks, defense is a shambles.

When people talk about communication issues in football it goes deeper than being able to speak the same language. And noting that they speak a second common language is even further from the point. There is no defensive understanding between them because they have little experience together, they both play quite unpredictably which makes it difficult for the other, and, in Lovren's case, having to learn a new position is another factor.

And here's the report on the game he went off injured in the 4th minute (Shelvey subbed on for him and BR shuffled the midfield to have Gerrard and Shelvey playing in front of Allen... this was over a year before Gerrard was switched into the deep role): http://lfcstats.co.uk/mancityhome1213.html

1. Kaboul, Rose, Dier will start. So I'd expect atleast Chiriches to be full strength. I'd like to see Vert play but I think our fitness is the least thing we have to worry about at this point in time in terms of our defense. 

2. Haven't watched them play this season. But Lescott is underrated and I'd expect him to make some good descions.

3. Lescott. That's saying a lot.

4. Yes, Dembele has solidified himself a spot in the line up much to my surprise. I expected him to be the odd man out for the majority of this season. He's really been a lot better than the end of last season. He's been a joy to watch the past few match's.

5. I am going to predict a 2-1 win for Spurs. I think they should rout West Brom but in their current form I'll take 3 points with a sloppy goal conceded. It'll be like Sunderland, but this time maybe the luck will be on our side. Lamela and Ade score in this one.

              LLoris

Dier - Kaboul - Chiriches - Rose

         Capoue - Dembele

  Lamela - Eriksen - Chadli

The doctor calling Clara before regenerating to make sure she's ok was likely as a character due to the last time he regenerated with a companion still around. Which was Rose. Who had quite a difficult time accepting 10 at first. And even when 10 nearly regenerated Rose still begged him not to change.

Amy and Rory were sort of fading from the doctor's life for awhile. We saw them together but we knew that for him there was great spans of time when they were apart. In the end Amy left the doctor for Rory. The same for Martha who left the doctor for a normal life. He could be concerned he might lose Clara in the same manner and is becoming just a little jealous.

I honestly think your mum would be in a much better situation if she just faced her debts. She's not committing any crime in ignoring her creditors, but interest may be accumulating on what she owes, and her debts are surely going to catch up with her at some point.

I'm pretty sure she could get interest and charges frozen if she got herself onto a repayment programme, and she wouldn't have to pay back at a rate more than she could afford - maybe £50 a week, or something.

At a glance, your recent post history is basically comprised of angry comments 'outing' ignorant, 5 year old plastic fans who you are seemingly convinced populate this forum, but yet you continue to frequent the sub on the daily.. 

And I hate to tell you ""*American*Steve"" but most local Liverpool fans believe that you don't pick your football team, you're born with it. It's something that is decided by where you're born and you're obligated to support your team through thick and thin because it's the pride and joy of *your* city.

Both are where they are because they got that chance and took it with both hands and worked hard to hold onto it.  Sure, BR is probably a fine coach, but crediting their success entirely to the manager is probably unfair.

I understand the economics quite well, but net spend is a poor measure when it comes to analyzing a manager's spending and how effective that spend is.

Sorry, we'll just have to disagree on Balotelli.  His dribbling isn't great, he's not a great passer at all, his movement is poor, his work rate isn't great, etc, etc.  I've went back and watched all the youtube stuff I could find and 90% of his goals are first time hits into the back of a largely open net from 10 yards or less out, penalties, or free kicks.  He's a good finisher inside the box when provided with the right service, but other than that he provides little.  Frankly I'd be astonished if he ended up with more than 10 league goals this season, particularly since he's not taking penalties or free kicks.

Honestly, I think he (and we in general) did get a bit lucky last year.  He had forward players in excellent form who were able to score near at will (first Suarez, then Sturridge and Sterling for the last 17 games).  We still sucked defensively and weren't great at controlling the midfield, but now we don't even have that ability to score going for us, at least until (hopefully) Danny gets back.  

Personally I don't see anything wrong with having discussions like this.  Overall I have no concerns about BR- I think he's decent enough.

true,EmreCanPuns,lfc99,,"It's a mix of a lack of creativity and a lack of transition between defense and midfield, and midfield and attack. This is the main reason why I believe Gerrard should be dropped for someone like Allen or Can who can effectively move the ball from defense into attack. At this moment we're relying on Lovren to do that which is why you see him forced to spray so many long balls, and why he's higher up the pitch leaving holes behind him. 

For the link up between the midfield and attack, Coutinho is the man. Henderson hasn't had the best start to the season. We need Coutinho to play a little deeper role, with three in the midfield, with Sterling ahead of him, this way we will have a fluid connection between the forwards and the midfield. Lallana can also play this role.

In terms of today, I don't know why in hell Rogers thought playing Lucas Gerrard and Henderson would be a good idea. Lucas is one of the most one-dimensional players, and playing him ahead of Gerrard? The fuck? Usually Brendan nails his tactics on the head, but today was pretty atrocious. That's why when Lucas was taken off and Lallana was brought on in the second half the game completely changed hands.

Ontop of all of this Sturridge is injured, and you may think that's the reason why we're unable to score goals, but it really isn't. Borini and Balotelli are more than apt to finish multiple goals, but if we can't get decent balls to them other than sprays to the corner flags, they will just look like statues waiting for the ball. To play two strikers you need that link up, because you're not relying on one player to get in behind the defense, your relying on the ball being played to them (AT THEIR FEET!) then them being able to play off of each other and score goals. Hopefully we'll see a better team fielded next week. Hopefully something like this:

All teams need to do is apply a team press and we rarely make it to the final third (as you said: no transition). 3 in the back was a good call, but we still lacked a ball carrying mid to use it to our advantage.  Bit worrying, but its still early on. When sturridge is back, things will settle down. Balotelli is getting better and better every game. Things are looking up. 

Biggest worry is DM. Stevie's been off it starting from the WC and Lucas doesn't read the game half as well as he used to. I'd love to see what a Joe Allen and Emre Can pairing could do.

The issues and problems the NHS is facing are in major newspapers every day. Like the [Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NHS).

The US is not the only other developed country on the planet. If you only want to look at people who have it worse then there'll always be someone you can point at, the deterioration will continue, and nothing will ever improve. It's the same argument the Americans use ""it's worse in Africa, shut up"".

You have people who, rightly, get very upset about the NHS being privatised and funding being cut, arguing that it will make the standard of care worse, while at the *same time* shouting down anyone who tries to share bad experiences with the NHS, because you're not allowed to criticise the NHS no matter how bad it gets, even *as* it's being privatised and having funding cut or diverted. It's literal doublethink. Many of the people who say they think there are problems with the NHS are **on your side**. Doctors working in the NHS can see these problems, and discuss them, yet people like you can't bear to hear anything except 'the NHS is perfect and the best in the world'. The way many Brits treat the NHS reminds me of the way Americans treat their army.

Even if you have had good care in the past, at some point in the future you'll be seriously sick and will need the NHS, then you will find out what has been happening to it while you've been willfully ignoring it. At some point, as a country, it will not longer be possible to ignore what is happening to the NHS, it would be easier to fix things now and improve care before it gets that bad and more people die or have their health damaged unnecessarily, but if nobody wants to do anything until it gets that bad then they're the ones that have to live with the consequences.

The stereotype in England of Scotland is of a country living off England's money (even if it's made in Scotland), eating deep fried mars bars and taking heroin like it's Tobacco. Scotland could, if it was allowed to raise and keep most of it's money, be financially self sufficient but instead we have this weird situation where all contributions to the public purse in Scotland are sent to Westminster, relabeled ""England's Money"" by the public and doled out whilst they scoff at how we're a load of Welfare Queens who should be kicked back to being the glorified county they were pre 1999. And they can if they put a finger out! [You don't need that many MPs in a parliamentary vote to shut down the Scottish parliament if you are going to out vote Scottish MPs, and Westminster *can* shut down the Scottish parliament with one vote and *no* say from the Scottish people or their MPs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmx-KBTs-Ks) Westminster can legislate on anything in Scotland at any time if they want to, and if you get 60 MPs to vote for it they can drown out Scottish MPs objections and outvote them, and more than that, *well* more than that, are more than willing to do that. The West Lothian Question in that sense is still there. English MPs *can* legislate on Scottish laws, they just choose not to. And if they do, it would be a bigger problem than Scottish MPs voting on English laws because Scottish MPs can get outvoted by less than half of the English MPs.

But you know what? English MPs are *more* and willing to run with the idea of ""lazy, welfare hungry Scots"", regardless whether or not it's actually true. If Scotland is sending down more money than it gets back, that extra money could be used on say, London. I mean for fuck sake England, *we're not the Enemy*. London is spending £40 Billion on a main line railway in deep level tunnels in the biggest tunneling project since the Chunnel. Does London need it? No, it's got one of the best Subway systems on Earth! If you want to get across the city, switch to the Underground, that's why the Metropolitan Line was built to begin with, and that was in 1863! Think of what £40 Billion could do, transport wise for the rest of the UK! We could refurbish our already aging railways, we could fund the Manchester Crosstown Link, we could refurbish the Tyne and Wear Metro . We could improve cycle infrastructure outside London to bring it up to scratch with a good chunk of Europe! We could build a light rail system in Liverpool, all of those projects would benefit the UK economy *and would cost a sliver of what Crossrail costs.*

This will fall on deaf ears, and many people will bombard me with messages saying ""Your Wrong"" or ""if you believed that you should have voted Yes"", I've been getting those messages since Friday and I'm sick of them. We've given the chance to change things to people who are either apathetic or actively hostile to Scotland and her interests. We can't win, we're fucked one way or another. We're not going to get any new powers. I think maybe even the Scottish Parliament will be on it's way out. Shame, it's the best thing that's happened to this country since we got into the 98 World cup.

true,PrinceCheddar,rory,Rory,"Before Marvel was bought by Disney and started making their own movies (The Marvel cinematic universe with The Avengers in it) they sold the rights to their movies to various studios, most notable being Fox with X-Men and the Fantastic Four and Sony With Spiderman.

So long as they keep making films, they keep the original rights to those films they paid for and Marvel can't use them themselves. (so no Spidey in the Avengers) Hence why Sony went with a reboot of Spiderman when a lot of people were willing to make a fourth but not soon enough.

Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are blurry because, while they are mutants and children of Magneto, which partly makes them fall under Fox's X-Men license, in the comics they're mainly a part of the Avengers. So Avengers 2 can have them as long as they don't mention mutants or Magneto (probably) while X-men: Days of Future past can also have Quicksilver. 

If you want Spidey to be in the Avengers, don't watch the new movies so they don't make money. If they don't make money, they can't justify making them, so they won't and the rights return to Marvel. But if you want to watch the new spiderman movies no-one's really going to have a go at you or anything.

I appreciate the history and the link to the past and actually think that Elizabeth is a great HoS. I would be sad to see her go but I would like to see a discussion when she passes.

Charles has shown he is unafraid to get involved in issues and use pressure. Something not expected of him as king. 

The principle just boggles my mind, we scream freedom and democracy but have one family who are deemed special enough to occupy that highest echelon.

In a republic and child can rightly dream of being his/her country's HoS. Not in ours.

In 1979, we got told ""Vote no for Devolution"", we were told if we voted Yes it would risk the car plants in Bathgate and Linwood. We didn't get those new powers, Bathgate and Linwood closed within 20 years and we got the Poll Tax. I think I have the right to be pessimistic.

You may dismiss my ""vision"" as dystopia but the simple fact is we have a Backbench rebellion brewing that *will* nix any new powers to Scotland, Scrap the Barnett Formula (which will see Scotland give even more than we do now and get even less back) and we knew this *before* Thursday! Facebook and Twitter was abuzz with these facts and Scotland will now be powerless to stop it.

[Here's a video I think you should see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmx-KBTs-Ks). Note that Willie Rennie was an advocate for the No campaign but he openly admitted that, if Westminster wanted, they could abolish the Scottish Parliament, or legislate on Scottish laws at any time. People complain about the West Lothian question, but Scottish MPs number only 59 members at Westminster. You don't even need half of English MPs to outvote Scotland. But, if Westminster wants to, it could get rid of devolution tomorrow **and that was by admission of the No campaign!** There is a lot of ill feeling toward Scotland from England, ill feeling that this time next year could be mutual. England has the upper hand and always will. If English MPs want to they could abolish Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as entities and those nations would have *no* way to stop it because 117 MPs can't outvote 533 MPs. The taste for Scot's blood is there, Scotland won't come out of it the better, believe me.

I knew I read this before. On gov.uk it says,

I interpreted this to mean you only tell them if it affects you driving. My psychologist told me my symptoms did not affect my driving, hence I didn't think I needed to tell them. 

Oh and on the renewal form, where it asked whether I had any medical conditions, it also asked whether I'd already informed them about it.

true,Annaeus,eng-cumberland,Wind-blasted outskirts of nowhere,"I think that your first two points are untrue, or at least not as clearly true as you are stating. England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland do have fuzzy national identities to which people subscribe, but the moment you try to get agreement from any two people as to what, exactly, comprises those identities you discover how fuzzy they actually are.

Just look at some of the vitriol spewed during the lead-up to the referendum. Some Scots claiming that other Scots weren't really Scots because a true Scot would back independence (it's not call the 'No True Scotsman' fallacy for nothing). Others arguing that Scotland is a country of tolerance and acceptance, and that those who could not accept differing opinions were not representative of Scottish values.

On to English 'identity' - some English people see Englishness as being self-effacing, self-deprecating, and apologetic for the country's past transgressions; others wear chain mail armour, protest on the streets, and mourn the loss of empire.

Northern Ireland's identity is even less to do with 'Northern Irishness'. There is no real 'Northern Ireland' identity per se, but rather a (sometimes volatile) blend of Irish and *British*. Loyalists in Northern Ireland hold to the idea of Britain, not of Northern Ireland. Republicans favour Ireland, not Northern Ireland.

And finally you have to deal with the fact that the union has existed for centuries, with all the resulting cross-migration. The Welsh borders are culturally so blended that there is simply no sense in calling people on one side culturally Welsh, and those on the other culturally English. The England-Scotland border is not only porous and inter-bred, but has been moved by force and by treaty repeatedly. And England is such a mongrel country that a conservative Muslim and a liberal proto-anarchist can both be thought of as quintessentially English, provided they can sit down together with a cup of tea and a custard cream.

I'm also not sure where you got the idea that the constituent countries are seen as equal partners in the union. Many in Scotland do indeed see themselves as equal partners, but I don't think that more than an isolated minority in either Wales or Northern Ireland do. Northern Ireland, in particular - the loyalists at least - see themselves as an integral part of a single Britain, not as members of a distinct sub-country co-equal with England.

There are more differences within the four nations than between them. London is more culturally distinct from Cornwall than Cornwall is from Wales. There is more cultural separation between the Shetland Isles and Glasgow than there is between Edinburgh and Berwick. And two neighbours in Northern Ireland can see themselves as so different from one another that they attempt to kill each other - or at least such was the case for many years.

So the very notion of an upper house founded on separate but equal constituent states, treating each as distinct, is founded on false assumptions regarding the culture, national identity, and national identification of the people of the UK.",0,1411289959,null,0,false,0,cko9yj5,t3_2gy3ct,t1_cko9yj5,t3_2gy3ct,null,1426896818,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Skrtel has been terrible in the games hes played and is absolutely insane, Sakho is far better and younger.

&gt;Lucas instead of Allen, a formation with some actual width.

Without Allen we lose our ability to pass quickly and keep the flow, he brings so much balance to the team. And right now we have no width defensively and every attack we are going out wide and its clearly not working?

true,mr-strange,null,null,"This whole ""I want mine"" narrative is tawdry. One of the principle points of larger political entities is to allow wealthier areas to help support and nurture the less well off.

The EU is a prime example - poorer countries join, and the richer countries *give* them money to help them build up their infrastructure, educate their people, and invest in their businesses. Eventually those countries become valuable trading partners, making us *all* better off. These newly wealthy can then start contributing in their turn to new poor countries.

The local funding arrangements in the UK are similar. If every council was forced to raise all of its money locally, then London streets really would be paved with gold, while children ran naked through the open sewers of Liverpool! Seriously, it's quite obvious that the needs of a locale are usually inversely proportional to its wealth. If you have a thriving local economy, then you won't have many people who need housing benefit and social services. That's *why* local government money is redistributed centrally.

So. I don't know whether Scotland receives or contributes more than its ""fair"" share, **and it doesn't matter**.

It's a great thing when the score is even but those early goals really should effect some sort of change. It's frustrating watching our defenders passing the ball between them.

Lovren is basically given all the space he needs by the opposition because he fancies the long ball and more often than not we end up giving possession right back. Sakho too his credit keeps the ball on the ground. But when we're behind it really shouldn't be our centre-backs starting off moves.

The midfield needs to step up, Hendo and Lucas were happy to lay the ball off whenever there was pressure on them, they need to take charge take the ball and make a forward run, either take the foul or find an opening, their frequent back-passes to retain possession just bouyed West Ham right up, they were getting rewarded for every bit of pressure they put on them, that made their jobs a lot easier, so why stop, just charge out to every pass. The (central) midfielders have to be more assertive, beat the marker and move play forward. If they can at least make the defenders work a bit harder the pressure on them will abate a bit.

Basically we need Allen and Coutinho back pronto, possibly Lallana needs to play more centrally and give Sterling/Markovic/our FBs the flanks.

At the very least there has to be some variation, the fact that we're still employing the same style when we're ahead and when we're behind can't be lost of opponents, they basically need to set up the same way every single game and we're left floundering.",0,1411293483,null,0,false,0,ckoajft,t3_2h0azr,t1_ckoajft,t3_2h0azr,null,1426896547,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

That improved drastically, it's only now that the problem has resurfaced, most likely because of all the new faces. Our opening fixtures haven't been kind at all. All difficult games, Villa are a different beast when they're on the road, and Big Sam has quietly assembled a side that'll take points of the big teams this season (Spurs were extremely lucky on the opening day) The dysfunctional play can be put down to players that have rarely played alongside eachother. The Spurs game offers hope, it shows what we can do and what we will do. The right system with players know each other and their strengths/weaknesses. Give it time and the cohesion will be back, that's the hallmark of a Rodgers side, as the season progresses we will get better, much better.

The Westminster centric mps treated the campaign with contempt,  paid the entire thing no mind or the barest lip service right up until the point where there was a poll that showed the referendum was on a knife edge.

At that moment, the entire Westminster system completely shat the bed, going on an emergency campaign accompanied by a vast amount of doom and gloom stories in the media, making hollow promises that, as salmond says, some of them cannot wait an entire week before they try to weasel out of them, or corrupt what they originally promised in favour of their party interests.

And in the course of this shitting the bed, a large focus was on what bastards the Scots would be to have the temerity to have a vote that would affect the UK, either because of changing the bloody flag, the economic effect or because God dammit it just isn't fair to the rest of the uk that a large enough group of people are so pissed off  that they have a calm vote to leave instead of costing the walls with blood like we saw with the IRA.

Let us not forget that all of these defenders, have at one point or another been excellent players and prospects. 

If you watch Carragher and Neville's analysis after each game, over the last year too, it seems clear that they are not carrying out basic principles of organised defending - something that they have all done at their previous clubs. 

Lovren was a beast last season. Sakho was one of the most talked about young centrebacks in his time at PSG - and helped take France to the quarters at the WC. 

Gerrard, on the other hand, perhaps hasn't helped. He had a great season last season, but we conceded an obscene amount of goals for a team playing 2 CBs and a DM that always stayed back and often slotted in as a third CB. 

There is a serious defensive issue at our club and questions need to be asked when every other team, bar QPR, seem capable of defending better with lesser players. 

Tiago Illori or not, there are root causes for a shit defending that extend past our personnel.

http://imgur.com/G73SEii

a boundary was created to allow unionists to remain in the UK, this boundary incorporated areas that had voted for independence. To create an artificial majority is undemocratic. Scotland recently rejected independence Glasgow and the Highlands however voted for independence why shouldn't we create a new international border for them now if it's a perfectly democratic process. The creation of Northern Ireland perfectly meets the definition of gerrymandering as it included areas without a unionist majority while maintaining a unionist in NI as a whole. These areas were incorporated so that the Unionist areas could support themselves...again undemocratic.

Question: When is the will of the majority not democratic?

Answer: When you talk to /u/dontthrowstones about the history of NI. 

&gt;During the 19th century, legal reforms started in the late 18th century continued to remove statutory discrimination against Catholics, and progressive programmes enabled tenant farmers to buy land from landlords. By the close of the century, autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, known as Home Rule, was regarded as highly likely. In 1912, after decades of obstruction from the House of Lords, it became a certainty. A clash between the House of Commons and House of Lords over a controversial budget produced the Parliament Act 1911, which enabled the veto of the Lords to be overturned. The House of Lords veto had been the unionists' main guarantee that Home Rule would not be enacted, because the majority of members of the House of Lords were unionists. In response, opponents to Home Rule, from Conservative and Unionist Party leaders such as Andrew Bonar Law and Dublin-based barrister Sir Edward Carson to militant unionists in Ireland, threatened the use of violence. In 1914, they smuggled thousands of rifles and rounds of ammunition from Imperial Germany for use by the Ulster Volunteers, a paramilitary organisation opposed to the implementation of Home Rule.
Unionists were in a minority on the island of Ireland as a whole, but in the northern province of Ulster they were a very large majority in County Antrim and County Down, small majorities in County Armagh and County Londonderry and a substantial minority in the rest of the province.[19] These four counties, as well as County Fermanagh and County Tyrone, would later constitute Northern Ireland. Most of the remaining 26 counties which later became the Republic of Ireland were overwhelmingly majority-nationalist.",0,1411296966,null,0,1411297176,0,ckob4gl,t3_2gyg2n,t1_ckob4gl,t1_ckoaa3y,null,1426896275,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

Gordon Brown set out a clear and precise timetable on the devolution of new powers to Scotland. Better Together then took this message to the electorate, and they **[did not frame it in ambiguous terms](http://www.bettertogether.net/page/-/images/devo%20leaflet.png/@mx_572)**. That timetable did not last 12 hours after the referendum, and the most spectacular repudiation of it came from Brown's own Labour party.

Prior to the referendum, the unionists presented a united front on the matter of more devolution. Now each of them has proposals of their own, and a timetable of their own to go with it. Labour won't work with the Tories' proposals because they face losing considerable power at Westminster if they accede. No one will work with Gordon Brown's proposals because, quite simply, they have always been unworkable.

Almost all of England's money seems to be sent to, and spent for the richest area of the UK (London) leaving parts of the North of England to turn into Economic backwaters and (dare I say) play a part in encouraging Extremism, White nationalism and Islamic extremism.

Northern Ireland is still an economic Basket Case. Better than it was in the 70s, but that's like saying to someone who's lost an arm ""at least you're not a Vegetable!""

Now, after being told a No vote would ""secure the banks"", we've been told there's still a chance Lloyds will move to London anyway! Fancy that!

Let's face it. This is an equal union in the sense that we're both getting fucked in some way or another. It's not the Scots screwing up the Union, nor is it really the English, but the over centralisation of power and economic clout around London and a system where a perfectly able country has their own money sent down to London and doled out to them in dribs and drabs.

The Extra money from Barnett would not exist if Scotland had become independent, Scotland would have had to compensate for the loss of that income elsewhere, mainly through government borrowing and taxation.

If Scotland gets what is essentially Home Rule, and the ability to tax business and individuals as they would have done under independence, the Barnett benefit would no longer be tolerable to the citizens of the rest of the UK.

The West Lothian question has been an issue for a very long time now, and it is hardly prophetic to suggest that this issue would have to be resolved at some time, regardless of a referendum.

But increased autonomy for Scotland (and remember that Scotland already has a high degree of autonomy already) would make it imperative to resolve this issue. This isn't party political, England isn't the Tories, England is 53 million people who also have their own political views and interests.

I agree that when he is on his best, Adebayor is unplayable. But predicting Adebayor's consistency is like making a precise weather forecast for the year on Jan - 1. It's happened countless times, at countless clubs, with countless coaches (alright maybe countless is a bit of a hyperbole). 

Adebayor might be good right now, but history shows he can be better and that he might decline out of nowhere.

Instead of getting Lovren to keep our defensive line up and be pro-active when defending, we could have shaped Ilori or young CB who are very quick to adapt. Lovren is still in his own decent, but it will take time for him and IMO Sakho to settle with the other fullbacks. The only thing left is for the midfield and attack to find understanding, something that requires time.


We lost Suarez and were supposed to have Sterling provide his creativity and some of his goal scoring ability, then for someone to take Sterlings contribution last season and add to it say Lallana. The problem is Sturridge is gone, Sterling has done well and Lallana just returned. To add to our problem Coutinho is completely out of form. That is recipe for shit performances offensively. I'm sure the second half of the season will be great, but I had hoped the first part would be better and it isn't due to our midfields inability to contribute much like last season. We need Balo and Sturridge to play together and start getting goals then we at least have 3 threatening forwards.

So the call's what gets the Doctor to attempt the rescue in the first place, so by default he'd be creating a paradox if he didn't convince the woman (forget her name) to make the call. However, the circumstances that lead her to do so weren't dependent on the operation, or even being in her office at that specific moment in time. Had something occurred where it was the only possible moment, then I'd understand. However, the whole situation feels like running into a wall that's 3 feet wide but free to just contour, but your field of vision is so thin you can't notice.

Why couldn't the Doctor just fly the TARDIS into her office, and then make the speech he made at the end of the episode? He could have given her the came card that says ""I'm a time traveler,"" asked her to call him, have her flee and the Teller sent after him... but without all the fuss in the middle of the episode. It would have kept everything intact.

You can remove Capaldi as the Doctor in these episodes, this one especially, and replace him with any of the previous regeneration's of himself, and it still works. Hartnell, Baker(s) McCoy, etc. that's what makes this story great. Also the fact that the entire episode was the Doctor creating a paradox, even with his memory erased. Only the Doctor could do that! Most importantly, here is an episode where everyone wins, even the bad guy(girl). The cyborg and shape-shifter learned to rely on others and even self sacrifice for the first time in their entire lives. For that the Doctor has them rewarded. The teller and it's mate are free and together, very Doctor-ish thing to do. The bank president escapes, but after a long life of feeling guilty at what she had done, is given the chance to redeam her final actions by contacting the Doctor from her death bed and thus the paradox. Everyone's happy ending is possible only by taking the long way around getting to what we see as the actual reason for all this happening the way it does.

true,TheLastOnTheWall,null,null,"I'm a Scot who voted No, so my views may differ significantly.  These past few months, I've felt very British and I suppose it had to do with me trying to back up my viewpoint.  From putting Defence, Foreign Office and Global Clout on a pedestal, not to mention using famous/significant citizens of the UK interchangeably, I tried to keep the allure of Britain alive in my head.  FWIW I still do believe that the UK is a great country and a world power.

However, my thoughts on Scotland staying varied quite wildly on Friday.  I got a few hours sleep, and awoke at 3am to watch the events unfold.  As the results came in, I never really celebrated the ""wins"" across the land.  My own council voted Yes, but I remained optimistic that the UK would pull through.  As the scenario unravelled, and Scotland voted No, I felt a great sense of neutrality.  I think it was the relief rather than jubilation had taken hold of me.  Even though the majority voted No, a great many Scots wanted out.  Where does that leave the union?  Rather than business as usual, people up here are wanting recounts/revotes.  When will that end?  From trying to fight to maintain a link with the rest of the UK, I feel that you're all turning your backs on us.  It's like your parents saying they're going to divorce but change their mind.  You know something's not quite right, but you need to just get on with things and hope the marriage mends.  You want the rest of the extended family to stay out and let you quietly get on with things - the global media in this case - but they want to continue to prod you for a reaction.  

I don't know.  I really want us to stay together, but I feel a great sense of uncertainty to follow.  If Westminster could give those who want more powers something to pacify them, it may help, but that may just lead to more referendums when some Scots feel they can control the finances of a country comfortably.  All I know, is that if I had to vote again, my answer would not change. ",0,1411304359,null,0,1411305662,0,ckockux,t3_2h133y,t1_ckockux,t3_2h133y,null,1426895596,172,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,172

Begging the question is also sometimes called assuming the conclusion and the basis of his rant was, ""Scotland is a separate nation and Westminster is stealing our oil so we should have voted to be a separate nation so it could be our oil.""  Note how the conclusion and the premise are the same.

If he'd argued along the lines that a spectacular natural resource has been mismanaged and we ought to be independent so we can manage it for the good of Scotland instead of for the already rich and connected of the UK then he'd be on more solid ground.

When the writer goes out of his way to beat us over the head with"" Robin Hood isn't real,"" then to just turn around and go ""he's real, deal with it"" and then yeah, I have an issue. They could give some explanation, but no, the legend is 100% accurate, apart from the bits that were somehow left out of every single version where there's a flying machine and robots.

""And, no offense, but you completely missed the point of ""Listen."" It was never about the monster.""

So what was it about? Clara and Pink's boring romance transcends time and space? The fact that Clara once again is the most specialist snowflake in all the doctor's lives, who inspires him to become the man he is? Clara being irresponsible and keeping secrets from the Doctor for no adequate reason? Or the fact the Doctor made up a monster that, apparently, haunts everyone at one time or another in order to come to terms with one time where something grabbed him during the night? 

The point of the episode is for the episode to be scary, but the fear I'm supposed to feel from the ""scary"" scenes doesn't manifest because we know 1. it hides and 2. sometimes it grabs you and nothing else. So what is there to be afraid of? It's two distinguishing features is hiding (avoiding conflict) and doing something that does no lasting harm to anyone.

""Also what ""plot points"" did ""Deep Breath"" rehash?""

true,flangeball,null,null,"I agree and think you have to bear in mind that *any* constitutional change will advantage someone over someone else, so the only question is whether the change is a good and correct change or not. Change also often only happens when it advantages the incumbent power, but that doesn't necessarily mean its bad, though it can be if it tightens their grip. If it's a good change that happens to be convenient, that's exactly when it's time to strike.

I don't think excluding a small number of Labour MPs from an English parliament would advantage the Tories hugely -- politics will just shift around, and the Conservative party is just as threatened by UKIP in England anyway. [It's not like many parliamentary divisions have been shifted by Scottish MPs in the last 17 years](https://www.mysociety.org/2014/09/10/parliament-without-scottish-mps-how-would-it-have-looked-different-since-1997/), though those include some important ones like tuition fees. It'd be interesting to see the same analysis for any other regional group of MPs.

My main worry for an English parliament would be non-trivial situations such as when we have a Labour UK Parliament, and so a Labour UK PM with a minority of reserve powers, but a Tory-held English Parliament, and so a Tory English FM with the majority of devolved powers. Both have very similar levels of power. It's not as simple as just excluding Scottish MPs from English votes. Regional parliaments might fix this, but I'm not sure I'd trust that we'd get a good quality of politician -- local councils certainly don't. Maybe it can be resolved by simultaneous overhaul of the local authority system, plus more powers *should* mean greater voter interest. I'd worry it'd just be another excuse for rich regions to keep the wealth to themselves.

Personally I think, when it comes down to it, why *can't* over 600 full time MPs, all taken from different parts of the UK, represent us properly? Crowing about a London dominance is weird when they only have 73 MPs. Democracy doesn't mean getting your own way all the time, and I think we should move towards being able to find good compromises at a national level, rather than Balkanising into regional states with a patchwork of laws and regulations on the basis of they've-got-a-different-accent-to-us or they're-slightly-richer-than-us.",0,1411305733,null,0,1411307199,0,ckocxqj,t3_2h0t2e,t1_ckocxqj,t1_ckoch4v,null,1426895429,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3

I know people will disagree but I think we did the right thing in the 2nd half shutting up shop and killing the game at 3-0. We would have had to score 3 goals to get a result, which our attack wasn't capable of. Arsenal were really in the mood and had players that could destroy us on the counter. If we had opened the game up chances are they would have got a 4th 5th and maybe more rather than us pulling a couple back. With half the squad playing ill and physically testing games coming up, it was better to just get it over without any more damage.


A disappointing day but still far from the end of the world. Apart from those 5 minutes we defended well, we caused them problems in the first half. We're still 3rd in the league after a great start. We were always going to find this run of games to November REALLY difficult and lose most. We got the early points on the board that we needed and hopefully will have everyone fit and ready for our easier run from November through to January. It looks like this:

WHU have a different strategy to that of Liverpool and that reflects on the signings they make and the teams they field. Yesterday they fielded a physical team, sent out to physically outperform our team. Their plan worked a treat. They also did not have a match during the week, something that was working in our favor last season as well. Southampton are an unknown quantity with a new manager. They have the element of surprise on their side and can expect the unfamiliarity of their new set up to potentially continue giving them an edge for some more time. But I agree, they've started excellently and I would love to trade the current points tally with them. 

This is the toughest part of a season in recent history for Liverpool. We've been out of the UCL for so long and there's not enough experience with that competition in the club. The club are trying to put together a team for a longer period and there are several problems hindering that process. Everybody is learning and adapting. Mistakes were made and valuable lessons were learned. 

Like it or not Liverpool spent the summer buying young talent that has had no experience with the Premier League football. Those who have come in and do have it (Lallana, Lambert, Lovren, Balotelli) have missed time training and working with the team for various reasons.

It might seem that way because that feels like the most direct method where he prevents a goal from being scored, but positioning is far more important imo. Also properly organising a defence and good distribution leads to more possession and better break downs of attacks leading to less chances for the opposition and therefore less goals conceded. 

In the ideal world you don't want your keeper to be making any saves because you don't want the opposition to be having the chance to score. Obviously this isn't possible but the closer to it the better. Many keepers out there would bring us far closer to this and I feel like Reina was one of them.

It'd depend exactly whereabouts you decided to go, but I'm pretty sure there's plenty of buses from Sheffield bus station (which is really close to the train station).

As for camping I don't have anywhere particular to recommend. You could try just a regular camp-site or if you're looking for proper isolation you can try camping on farmland.

If you go for a camp-site I'd probably recommend going for a smaller one for a better chance to be alone. Find their websites and make sure you look at their costs, camp-site rules (some don't allow fires for example) and what amenities are available. Maybe look at reviews online too, to see what other people think of the site/owner. You could also ring up and see how busy they expect it to be that weekend.

If you try camping on farmland remember that you don't have the right to camp wherever you like like you would in, say, Scotland. You'll need to ask for the farmer who owns the land for permission and abide by any rules they set. 

Personally I'd recommend finding a camp-site. As you're going in November and during term-time I'd expect most places to be pretty empty. I also wouldn't worry too much about affecting other people as long as you're not obnoxious about it, people are generally understanding.

Just a few general points; wherever you camp will require at least a little hiking to get to (obviously more isolated places will require more), remember that you'll have to carry all your stuff too. I'd recommend getting some walking boots if you don't have some already, as well as a suitable rucksack. I'd also remember that you're going in November: 

a) it's going to be cold, bring layers, make sure you're sleeping bag's decent enough etc.

The thing about time travel is that something happens in the present and you don't know why and then later you do something which leads to what happened before. BUT you do NOT KNOW that your actions will lead to what happened before.
In certain episodes (like when the Tardis exploded) they do it not because it's the best what they can do at the moment, but just because they must make this ""loop"", which leads to the question why? At this exact moment they have the choice to do what they want and not like ""completing the loop"". It just doesn't make sense.
When David Tennant was the doctor time travel was way better. Like the first episode he met Martha at the beginning in the streets and she was like ""who the hell was that"" and at the end he showed that he had a real time machine by making this little ""loop""? He did it not because thought ""well i HAVE to do it because it was shown earlier in this episode"" but because he had a good reason. See the difference?
That's why the 10th was the best doctor.

And this episode was kind of useless. No big surprises (i mean that this thingies weren't suicide thingies and that this mysterious architect was the doctor itself... didn't need a sherlock to figure that out), too fast paced, no connection to ANYTHING (I mean this whole episode was about rescuing some strange overpowered creatures and... that's it), hardly any character development
(there is only one scene of character development, where doctor was all dark towards this cyborg human and said ""what you need is me"" and Clara didn't even said anything. In ""Into the Dalek"" she slapped him across his face. Here he was like all egocentric and she didn't do anything), 
useless characters, characters acted illogically.

(like this evil woman; she killed so many of her clones and possibly many other costumers with supposedly evil intents and she didn't even flinch. cold-hearted bitch. and SOMEHOW when she was dying she was all like ""oh I regret now things"". PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE LIKE THAT. she just magically turned all nice and sorrowful. if they showed HOW she changed like that it would be SOMEHOW believable. but now like this).

Like I said in my original comment, pressing, when done *properly*, is not just running, running, running.  There is LOTS of running.  But it is done with discipline, and there are very clear decisions about when to press, and when to not.  Your front 3-4 players are responsible for triggering a whole team press, and they need to be responsible about when to activate it.

HS2) and attempting to justify it by its surplus? From the perspective of a person in, say, the North of England, they're both attempting to reward themselves for the wealth they bring in (except they are choosing different ways) unlike what the rest of the country gets.

Either argue that each region should get investment/rewards based its contribution, or that the wealth should be shared across the country. Just don't be hypocritical and claim that it would be a fine situation if Scotland enjoys favourable public bonuses versus the rest of the country for its wealth but the politicians aiding the Southeast are being any less assholes if they attempt the same.

People on both sides have been calling people idiots for not agreeing on voting intention while dodging the issues that made both a valid option. Holding a referendum you can also call divisive but when it was democratically mandated there was no choice and I don't think you could have seen a Yes campaign you would have been happy with.

Since then both sides in Scotland have become more entrenched. In the last 24 hours I've seen a ton of people changing their Facebook images to include a 45 as a reference to the 45% that they were part of in voting yes, somehow believing it gives them a moral high ground which it doesn't.

At the same time I've seen people who voted no tell me and others that because they personally don't want more devolution it's ok for politicians to have lied to us about it. We were promised a timeline would be published on Friday by the party leaders when they knew fine well they disagreed and couldn't deliver. Politicians lie and that is never ok.

In the aftermath both sides are being divisive and blaming the other. There is no moral high ground that either can hold, we need to start working together across the UK because, even though I voted yes, I don't see Scotland as the only part of the UK that wants change. The best chance we have now for a positive future is for as many people to engage in the changes that are coming but I don't think it will happen.

true,tusksrus,,Blairite | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,"You are assuming that Labour argue for the status quo. They want to devolve power to regions of England, rather than simply reconfiguring the way Westminster uses the power it has.

&gt;Banning Scottish votes on English matters is the only realistic solution to the West Lothian question.

I am genuinely trying to think of a worse solution, but it's difficult.

Scotland will have to be given (more) taxation powers, which will have to be given to England. Who tables money bills for England? Constitutionally, only the Government may do that. What if the Government has no majority in England? You would need an English Government to run the NHS and other devolved matters. As far as I am aware, no English executive has been proposed. You wouldn't want it to just be Westminster MPs anyway - it would mean that when the English FM is not the British PM, that the English PM is the Leader of the Opposition. Is that desirable? I don't think so, it would pollute the selection process for the FM by the English public in a way which does not happen anywhere else.

What if the Prime Minister is Scottish?

That is what you said. Regardless of how much discipline or control there is, it is still a higher intensity tactic that takes a higher level of physical fitness and conditioning.

Yes! 

Any religion with central leadership that sees people interpreting it in violent ways or abusive ways should be policed this way. Were it Christianity I would fully expect local vicars all the way through to the damn Pope speaking out to criticise or distance themselves from Christians who acted this way. 

I am not especially prejudiced against Muslims or the Islamic faith - but if they want to be accepted in this country then they need to police their own flock. 

&gt; I mean, if you believe in subsidized healthcare and so do 95% of child molesters, do you feel like you should be hunting down child molesters? If you play chess and abu hamza does too, are you gonna stage a protest on behalf of all chess players?

Do you really think these things are comparable? 

Subsidized healthcare or playing chess does not teach us how to lead our lives or what our chosen god wants us to do or how he/she/it wants us to act. 

Muslims and the Islamic faith however - *does teach this* and where honor killings are concerned people are killed for the shame they bring their families and this faith provides the backdrop. 

You're comparing apples and oranges there. 

&gt; They aren't responsible for the beliefs other people have. 

Muslims and the Islamic faith however, *are*. 

Reference the young British people who have gone to fight alongside ISIS for further evidence of this. These young people absolutely bought into the teachings and propaganda they were fed - which taught them to fight. 

If EDL did they I would expect them to be treated the same way as ISIS. As they don't, I expect them to distance themselves from those who misinterpret what to do.

true,TinyZoro,null,null,"He does not want a violent revolution but like many people he wants to overthrow the status quo which is demonstrably not working out for humanity.

He also like me and many people thinks that our democratic systems have pretty much completely broken at this point and the whole media narrative that we should care about the latest supposedly high intensity debate between the party leaders on the NHS is a smokescreen where in reality three center right parties which agree on almost everything differentiate themselves over highly marginal soundbites. Again many would agree with that.

So then it comes to the understandable but some what difficult question to answer in a soundbite 'so what would you do then' Something I get personally a lot when I complain about most of the ways we run the world.

This is difficult to give a satisfying answer to a Paxman type you've got your 30 seconds now give it your best.

For a start one type of answer is that we all as individuals need to go through a process of really exploring our 'false goodness' something the left is very good at (e.g. pretending to care about others in situations where you stand to gain) and also going into our 'evil' something the right does (justifying self-interest as an ethical position and glorifying greed). There is no space for talking about this in depth - even on redit I haven't got the time to go into that properly.

What Brand is chiefly doing is pointing out how engineered and futile the whole terms of the debate are yet also how dangerous and damaging that is to all of us. Basically an Essex Chomsky.

The idea that everything boils down to doing X or not doing X. Being for Y are not being for Y. Turns every complex issue into stupid dumbed down talking points.

That is why when you think Brand is not answering what would he do. He's really saying what he would do is not really the point and not really that important what is important to start with is to realise that the whole illusion of living in a stable modern civilised democracy while all the evidence points to complete political disengagement. Ruinous short-term policies. Corporations not people in control of the direction of political travel.. etc. etc.

- The assumption of liberty. Rights are not granted by a piece of paper. People have the right to do all things that have not been prohibited by democratic legislation.

- Respect for history. British society has evolved over a thousand+ years of historical accident and that's a strength. We've tried all sorts of different things, kept the stuff that worked and abandoned the rest. 

- Embrace of modernity. While we respect history, we're not shackled by it. If something can be done better, we'll change it. If something is no longer in line with modern values, we'll abandon it.

- An open, multi-cultural society. We welcome foreign people and ideas, our culture evolving over time to incorporate those practices which produce good results.

- Mercantile pragmatism. The prosperity of Britain is our primary concern. We don't particularly mind how we get there, within reason.

- The admiration of restraint and moderation. We like the middle ground.",0,1411309000,null,0,false,0,ckodzrd,t3_2h18sw,t1_ckodzrd,t3_2h18sw,null,1426894936,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I get that Eccleston is a good actor, and I get that he reintroduced the doctor in a more modern adaptation, but every episode I watched in the first season, with the exception of the empty child, and the doctor dances, just fell flat. The cheesiness of the writing, the sub par acting from everyone aside from Chris, and the all around lame effects and corny visualizations on the show really made it tough to keep watching. 

I will be the first to admit that I got into the show because I heard everyone talking about it, so I went and started from the beginning on Netflix. I watched the first episode and I couldn't believe ANYONE would watch that shit. I didn't watch anything again for a couple months and then I decided that no matter how bad it was, I was going to power through to get caught up and hope it got better. It didn't really pay off Matt Smith began his tenure.

Were it Christianity (and it has been Christianity, many, many times) people would ignore the fact the abuser was christian because most people are christian and aren't child molesters.

Also, I know that Sandro has had injury problems but how on earth does Capoue stay while he moves on?

Lastly, when can we agree that 5 guys pushing for 10 square yards of space in the middle of the finishing third is a bad idea? God I never thought I'd say this but at least Sherwood understood this. I almost got a laugh as I looked up at one point and saw WBA's entire midfield and defense occupying the middle of the pitch just outside their box because they were smart enough to know that they didn't need to do anything else. Danny rose broke down the sideline in acres of space and the red team looked so surprised they didn't know what to do with themselves. I got so excited and then realized it didn't matter because there was no space in the box for a cross.

Having lived in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England, I have perceived the following meanings/identifications:

Northern Irish people when they say 'I'm British' mean 'I'm Unionist', which is a polite but suggestive way of illustrating their political position. Northern Irish people within Northern Ireland, especially outside of Belfast, are often less comfortable talking openly about politics, given the potentials for violence that has had in the past.

English people often say 'I'm British' as a politically-correct term which means the same as 'English'. Many consider Britain and England to be synonymous. My mother often does this. Its much like how the media will identify an English person as English or British but a Scottish or Welsh person as British primarily (the old Andy Murray joke comes to mind). I also think a lot of people from England will instinctively reach for 'British', but I'm not sure on the reasons. Perhaps because of Team GB? and 'British' used in media.

Most Scots I know identify primarily as 'Scottish' and the word use doesnt necessarily indicate political beliefs or loyalties (eg. Unionism, Nationalism, Separatism). Its just a strong identity that many people born or living in Scotland hold.

true,apinkknee,null,null,"Three things to consider from me: 

*Disclaimer: This is based on everything we believe about Poch's system, and his days at Southampton*

1. Pressing: We lacked *efficient and effective* pressing. At some points, West Brom had 5-6 seconds on the ball without *any* pressure what so ever. Other times we had 4 (FOUR!) lilywhites on one West Brom lad, leaving 3 others open for a passing lane. It was dis-jointed and inconsistent. The pressing was also MUCH deeper than in recent weeks. Perhaps our fitness is in question?

2. We stopped playing out of defence through a main pivot (who we've seen was Capoue/Bentaleb in recent weeks). Kaboul, Chirch, and Dyer all returned to a long ball game out wide that allowed West Brom to drop, condense the middle of the park and wait out the possession. This leads me to...

3. Final third build up: Essentially, we had none. Lamela came off the right to play into Eriksen's space, and Eriksen would shift. Adebayor, while trying to post up and receive a ball, rarely did. When that succeeded, the third man was *NEVER* running through for a flick on. Once we realized this wasn't going to happen, we reverted to wing play. Dominantly this was through Rose and Chadli in the first half, and Lennon/Lamela on the right-side in the second half. We had no consistency. 

West Brom did well enough to get back, condense the spaces, and wait for us to make an error, not wait for an opportunity created on their own accord. 

Thoughts: How do we counter this knowledge of lower-side teams condensing their third? We're not a tall, strong team (except: Ade/Dembele). I think logic dictates that we have to sort out a 3 to 4 man plan that utilizes that creativity and speed from Eriksen/lamela/Soldado, or Chadli.

England obviously has a much larger population than anywhere else in the UK so it's only normal that England has by far the biggest influence on what *British* is. Scottish things then aren't typically included in that. I think Scots try not to so they don't get diluted or something.

Go anywhere in the world and ask someone to list 10 *British* things. You'll be hard pressed to find someone that will say Kilts, Tartan, Bagpipes, Nessie, Deep Fried Mars Bars and so on because those are specifically Scottish in peoples minds.

Scots growing up learning about the culture/history/etc see those Scottish only things defined as such. It's what is around them, it's what they are told is their history. That becomes their national identity and British is really a bit of a technicality on top. 

Don't get me wrong there is lots of cross over, lots of reasons to be proud to be British, lots we have in common. We don't *refuse* to be British or reject it. However the deep rooted emotional connection is certainly Scottish.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Islam doesn't have a central leadership. It's a religion, anyone can join and do whatever they want, just like Christianity. 

Christianity has prominent structural figures: Vicars, the Pope, Archbishops etc. - whilst they cannot *force* per se, they can advise and guide people in how to interpret their faith. 

This is duplicated in Islam - see [Imams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam) etc. 

&gt; Were it Christianity (and it has been Christianity, many, many times) people would ignore the fact the abuser was christian because most people are christian and aren't child molesters. 

Christianity has had its fair share of controversy surrounding child abuse etc. - and should continue to answer for that. There are no double standards here. 

Furthermore some aspects of abuse are written into the Islamic faith - or at least given groundwork - i.e. how a woman should cover herself and be treated. 

&gt; are you arguing that Islam teaches people to molest children? 

I'm arguing that if followers of Islamic faith are interpreting that faith and coming up with the conclusion 'this is OK' - it's up to those of that faith to send a clear message that this is a misinterpretation. 

As another example of this: Westboro Baptist Church and any associations they have with Christianity as a whole. It's up to the larger Christian faith to a) disassociate itself and b) send a clear message that it does not endorse those of that entity and their actions *even though Christians as people are not directly responsible for those actions*. 

&gt; most mainstream religions are pretty clear on the whole ""don't be a scumbag"" thing.

As it should be - though Honor killings are still carried out by ignorant people who believe their faith mandates it: 

&gt; Therefore, although Islam does prescribe 100 lashes for fornication (sexual relations between unmarried people), and death by stoning for adultery (married people who have sexual relations outside of marriage), these punishments are not really meant to be performed as much as they are meant to make these crimes hated in the eyes of the society in order to minimize their occurance. The only practical way for these punishments to be performed in Islam is by confession of the guilty person. In these cases, Islam teaches that those who receive these punishments during their life will have their sins wiped away and will not have to face punishment for these crimes in the afterlife. However, Islam strongly recommends that Muslims who commit crimes repent, regret their mistakes and not to tell others about what they have done. Those who truly and sincerely repent to God, regret their sins and commit themselves to never repeating them again, God will forgive their sins and wipe them away. 

[Citation](http://www.questionsaboutislam.com/women-in-islam/islam-honour-killing.php)

Long story short: Those who affiliate with a faith and/or carry out crimes in belief of that faith should be appropriately policed by that faith - and that faith should distance itself from them and send a clear public message of reassurance that it neither condones nor encourages nor endorses such crimes. 

If multiple cultures and faiths are to co-exist then this is mandatory. If we must endure multiple faiths and idiots from all sides committing crime in the name of them - they should police themselves and their own.

4. I think Kaboul had more time on the ball in the opposition half then Ade.
5. Why is Kaboul dribbling past defenders? That's not his job, his job is to make Lloris look useless.
6. Thankfully Lloris had a good game or that would have been truly embarrassing.
7. Did Paulinho do anything besides kicking the ball out of bounds?

Originally I'd thought that this meant that the true number of people who voted yes for a considered and thought out reason was less than the outcome of 45%, but based on your comment it probably means that these 'fringe' votes shall we say balance out, and that the actual result was fairly accurate.

What you probably can't get from watching the stream is just how diabolical the ref was. Not to take any blame away from the team as we were truly terrible but time after time he gave poor decisions and spent more of the game making sure the throw ins were taken from the right place than dealing with Foster and his time-wasting.

I've never see Chiriches as bad as he was today, he just wasn't in the game. We can't play Dier out of position anymore, particularly with an actual right back on the bench. I know we desperately miss Walker but it's just not acceptable to keep Dier out there.

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"I was rather disappointed about how quickly the mood south of the border turned against Scotland as if this was a personal affront to them. That it was the English people Scotland was rejecting (or at least threatening to). 

I also found it rather sad at just how many couldn't grasp there was more to this than the film Braveheart, as if events that happened hundreds of years ago was the driving force behind this campaign. 

This subreddit isn't representative of the wider world since it's mainly young people that use media like this, so I was really shocked at the resentment appearing here towards Scotland. I had hoped this behaviour would have died out by now. 

For a country so keen on holding the Union together, there didn't seem to be much respect for the people living in that Union. Either they were rabid kilt wearing English hating nationalists or rose tinted deluded idiots.

I'm quite worldly travelled, so I know modern Germans don't really care about Britain beating them in WWII, but English (rather than Brits as a whole) seem to think beating Germany at anything, usually a sport is the greatest event and comparable to winning a war.

The world has move on quite a lot in my lifetime. The Germans bombed *my* house and killed quite a lot of *my* family, yet why is it that the resentment appears to come from people not even a twinkle in their father eye (or even their fathers) when the war ended and I'm the one that has got over it?

I really think English people don't really know was being English means and I think in large part that is because there isn't **An** English national identity, there are several. Instead of being proud of what we are now, there's always references to how great we were in the past. Wars fought centuries ago by strangers.

I think England really need to have a hard think about what (y)our identity is NOW. Maybe if you find a strong identity that belongs to you (and not your ancestors), you might not be so quick to try to discredit/diminish other parts of these islands who have already found theirs.

There really was an interesting and mature debate up here in recent years (not just the month it was in the headlines in the tabloids), it was that that inspired so many to turn out on the 18th and have their say. Unless the rest of the UK ""gets that"", you'll never break out of the cycle of non-representative politics that you have now.

I'm proud of being British, I'm proud of being English. I've never been so proud however as I was watching our political system being taken back by the Scottish people. I hope one day soon I can say the same about the other nations on this island. It wasn't always like this.

The left column is the article as it originally appeared, archived on September 9th. The right column is the article as archived on the 13th. 

In short, the reference to files going missing are still there, just buried in a paragraph and swamped by extra text describing some of the horrific admissions that came out during the course of the Select Committee hearing.

I am pretty sure that the article was edited both before the archive shot on the 9th and the 13th because I would have remembered such an explosive detail as the home office researcher being told to shut up by the south yorks police, and threatening her with her details being passed onto the rapists. 

That is incredibly bad for South Yorks police as theyre now on parliamentary record as having been infiltrated by, and actively protecting the paedophile gangs. 

&gt;She said they had heard evidence that the researcher had been contacted by two officers who threatened to pass her name on to the groomers in Rotherham and she had been left in fear of her life.

South Yorks Police need an Inquisition, and not the kind with the comfy chairs.

I don’t mind if that debate takes years, since I think that it should be run within the context of a lengthy constitutional convention, even if it means that Scotland gets extra powers long before England or the regions. However, we must start talking about it now in order to make it an election issue and have a reasonable chance of reforming English government before it gets ignored for another twenty years.

1. Chiriches looked entirely out of touch with reality. I'm yet to see him pull of a error free performance in a spurs shirt. He was all over the place and could have cost us a goal many times during the match. 'Cept it wasn't his fault for the goal, it was

2. Lamela. he lost the ball time and time and time again in midfield.He looked like an argentine Townsend. Seriously, Ran into trouble, he just cut in time and time again. The one time Dier forced him to go down the wing, he actually worked very well, but he's breaking the team with his current method of play.

3. Our whole general play was just awful. It was reminiscent of AVB. In fact, AVB was sacked for not a whole lot more. The movement was non existent. Our defensive play was awful (Sandro was missed, and I have no idea why Vertonghen didn't play. I don't give a shit if he played europa, chriches is not up to the standard). 

4. Why we didn't buy a striker in the transfer window I just don't know. Soldado actually looked okay when he got on, but we still on registered one shot on target to their four. 

5. Are our players actually just mid table? I mean compare the team to the 2009-10 season? We really shouldn't be struggling this hard  (Gomes, Charlie, Dawson, King, BAE, Lennon, Modric, Palacios, Bale, Defoe and Crouch). Seriously. Look at that. Is our team really that much worse now? We played some incredible football back then, and our team isn't horrifically worse, but we haven't played any particularly great football this season or in fact since Harry got sacked.

O2 no longer do any unlimited data deals (except Giffgaff, who I believe now throttle during peak for heavy users) so that's off.

Vodafone are crazy pricey and I think only go up to 10GB.

T-Mobile do 2000 minutes, and unlimited texts + data for £25.99 (1 month, you can get money back with rebate sites.)  Along with Three that's probably your best alternative.  I encourage corrections in replies to this post.

If you're with Virgin Media, they do a crazy good plan for £18/mo but I'm unsure about throttling, I think they throttle down to 2G speeds after about 2-3GB but may be incorrect.

The bedroom tax is mainly the result of lack of new houses being built, and I know this seems cold and harsh but if the house was given to you by the council then it isn't yours per se it remains the property of the council. It's their job to be fair to all. For example if there were a 4 person family next door to you and they only had 1 bedroom and you have a 2 bedroom house and the second bedroom is used only at the weekends then it's more fair that you swapped houses. Hopefully the tax is used for home building and we could avoid this type of situation but until we have more houses in the UK then I think this is the best option we have.

&gt; I really think that this episode shows without a doubt that Twelve still cares. Yes he sounds callous at times and yes he is pragmatic, but he definitely showed a bit of understated sadness when he realized he couldn't save Saibra and when he walked away from Psy after blowing up in his face he looked like someone with huge insecurity in his own actions and regret in his words. [](#s ""And when he finds out they are actually both alive. He is completely shocked and eventually enlivened and happy when he can hand them their payment."")

&gt; Again I think that Twelve is trying hard to come to terms with the fact that he cannot save everyone. He doesn't want the fear of letting people die to bring him past the breaking point again. I think that deep down he really does want to be a hero and save the day. He wants everyone to live. [](#s ""(And nearly every one does in this episode.) So in essence the Architect's, his own, payment to him is that Saibra and Psy lived."")

Just because he isn't despondent or acting with a empathetic attitude doesn't mean he doesn't care any more. I really feel like his callousness is a crutch or a coping mechanism so he can hide and ignore his own sadness and guilt over his inability to save everyone. He doesn't want to focus on the people he failed to save; he wants to focus on the people he can save.

If you want to see a good DM watch the City v Chelsea game ... Matic and Fernandinho are doing so soo much better then gerrard in terms  of there defensive responsibility.

This added with the fact that the offensive threat  of gerrard is being neutralized by tactics by teams to man mark him.. Gerrards offensive threat has all but disappeared ...

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;Becuse let's face it poch's system is very similiar to AVB and with that said it hasen't got much success.

Where do people keep coming up with this. 

Yeah, both managers prefer dominating posession, but in different ways. AVB's buildup is painfully slow, safe, sideways passing. We'd get into the box and do nothing, and then get killed on the counter. Poch's possession is a complete, complete change from this. The ball is moved up the field as a priority, and losing it is perfectly fine, as long as we keep pressing and get it back within reasonable time. Possession is just a part of the modern game. 

It's ironic that you mention the ""high paced counterattack"" as a Spurs hallmark, because we've historically been tied to Ajax in the way we play. Just read up on Arthur Buckingham and  the origin of ""push and run"". 

*In 1934 a 19-year-old wing-half called Vic Buckingham signed for Spurs and played his first season at the Northfleet nursery. He went on to play 230 games for the club, most of them under the tutelage of McWilliam. When he stopped playing in 1949, he went into management, encouraged by Rowe who he viewed as something of a mentor. In 1953-54 Buckingham almost became the first manager to win the modern Double, taking the West Bromwich Albion side of Ray Barlow and Ronnie Allen to within four league points of the feat. In 1959 he took his ideas, honed under McWilliam and encouraged by Rowe, to Ajax of Amsterdam. There he laid the foundations of a system called Total Football and discovered a young player who he nurtured and encouraged. The player’s name was Johan Cruyff.*

http://sabotagetimes.com/reportage/tottenham-legend-arthur-rowe-was-footballs-quiet-revolutionary/

People are blowing the loss out of proportion. We had the same bullshit after Europa last year. United and Liverpool both lost. Not a big deal. Poch is young, our players are young, and both are learning how to think according to the system. Just because you see *some* similarities doesn't mean they're carbon copies.

true,Rainen,null,null,"Guys...

It's not our defense or lack of creativity.

It's our midfield.

Right now, we can't win the midfield on offense or defense. 

Defensively, opponents skip through because we're playing Gerrard and Lucas together, who are both too slow, and then have a run at our CB's. It is not fair to expect our CB's to be able to deal with players running at them all day while marking - it's impossible and they're often outnumbered.

Offensively, we cannot get enough control to do the same to the opposition. We end up with Lovren hitting longer balls (most passes v Villa and v West Ham too I think) fizzed in to Balo or Sterling or whomever, and then they are immediately closed down with nobody to pass to or support them because of our lack of mobility, threat and pace going forward with Gerrard sitting back (always, and now marked out of the game) and the alternative being Lucas ('nuff said). Conceding early goals compounds this, as the other team as no incentive to go forward to create additional space, and simply sits 10-11 men behind the ball all day.

The 3-5-2 we switched to helped some yesterday, and it was visible. The pass wide was always on, and provided options. Sturridge will help this as well, as he stretches the field vertically.

We need to sit Gerrard and start playing 3 of Allen, Hendo, Lallana, Can, Coutinho and potentially Markovic in the central areas. I even beleive a 4-3-3 would work much better with more mobile players - it's a high energy formation that doesn't work when you have immobile DM's.

Yeah that would be because they're playing a different position mate.

Neither of them are the playmaker that gets on the ball and starts attacks, they make tackles and give the ball to someone else.

The song is ""go on home British soldiers"" which I maintain is not sectarian because it's not religious.

Adding new road capacity into the mix would have also been expensive, disruptive and created more pollution. Getting more people to cycle has been an ongoing process but a lot of people are put off by the risks of sharing the roads with large vehicles.

Lovren and Sahko are not communicating right, they go for the same headers and the result is always bad.  

Balotelli.  While he has shown a defensive side to his game that was previously untapped.  (How many times have we seen him clear a corner for a defensive set piece on the near post?)
He isn't very good at cute interchanges and perfectly weighted balls.  It isn't good that he comes that deep to get the ball.  I grant that this may be due to a lack of good service.  He needs to stay deep and make better runs.  I'm happy with him and he seems to believe in the system.  

Lambert needed these last two matches.  He is a better passer than Balotelli, he knows the stiff, defensive tactics employed by West Ham and Villa and is familiar with Lallana.  

I think next week against Everton there will be 10 goals scored by both sides.  It will be nice to play against a manager that likes to attack as well.

I disagree, for all the bad government brings about it brings about a hell of a lot more good I'd rather vote to make it better than to overthrow the status quo which at no point in history as far as I know has ever worked well.

&gt;He also like me and many people thinks that our democratic systems have pretty much completely broken at this point and the whole media narrative that we should care about the latest supposedly high intensity debate between the party leaders on the NHS is a smokescreen where in reality three center right parties which agree on almost everything differentiate themselves over highly marginal soundbites. Again many would agree with that.

So basically those who disagree with you just fall for propaganda yes I'm putting words into your mouth here but my point stands, people are allowed to disagree with you and we don't need a highly different government our government is fine, all the parties are different.

He didn't say anything to Paxman though, he just mumbled.

Brand does what every person does when their grumpy and points out flaws, yes it's fucking easy, my alcoholic uncle can do that and he can barely form a coherent sentence even when he's sober.

Someone who can point out flaws is not someone worth listening to, someone who can fix them is.

&gt;That is why when you think Brand is not answering what would he do. He's really saying what he would do is not really the point and not really that important what is important to start with is to realise that the whole illusion of living in a stable modern civilised democracy while all the evidence points to complete political disengagement. Ruinous short-term policies. Corporations not people in control of the direction of political travel.. etc. etc

You just sound like a conspiracy nut, ""big pharma and corporations mannnn"", yes government seems to be short term that's something that needs to be fixed but HOW?

As I understand it, the bedroom tax only applies to people who are in government assisted housing. 
The whole point of government assisted housing is that the people who need it get it, why should a single mother with childen who has escaped an abusive relationship not get your house, as you're a single parent who has a child every weekend? 

Effectively your argument on housing boils down to who should the benefit system help and how much should they help those people. Maybe living for a year in a country where there is no benefit system would make you more willing to accept the bedroom tax? 

Furthermore, in answer to your original question, the public can object to a government decision, in the next vote. As a student in the first year of the 9K student fees I know about unfair policy. But as a believer in the democratic process I understand that the government can't please everyone and that's okay, because they stand for the majority.

Despite that, the team played very well. They took the fight to chelsea, and while we couldn't break down Chelsea's defence while it was still a game (i.e. before Zaba was sent off) we dominated the midfield and had some really nice movements. Yaya definitely redeemed himself from wednesday. Fernandinho continues to be incredible. Silva was brilliant as usual, and Milner did what Milner does best, but even better than usual. MotM contender for sure, but for me that honour has to go to Mangala for a fucking awesome debut. Him and Kompany kept Costa in their pocket the whole time and he was solid as fuck all game.

""Frank Lampard taught me that it was okay to love another man.
But I'm going to go back and watch the game again, maybe take some screen shots, but damn, we definitely make a serious trade off when we sub Schurrle on. He was done by Milner time and time again. I was watching Sky and they showed the lead up to Lampard's equalizer, and good god He looked like He couldn't be helped to make a challenger. Full credit to Milner, but Schurrle just let him skate by a couple times.

Oh and what could have been, Costa's left footed shot that struck the post will probably end up being the closest to a heart attack I have all week.

Gave away the ball foolishly at times and I still think we aren't quite decisive enough in the final third.
I wanted those 3 points, but I can't say that this is a bad result? We just drew our arguably biggest title challenger at away.

Oddly enough, their first release (Called ""My Dangerous Loverboy"") was a cheesy music video that doesn't mention anything racist at all.

[Here](http://www.mydangerousloverboy.com/cross-platform/) is a link to their self promotion on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube, dated 2008. This uses platforms that young girls will primarily use. The music video can be found [here](http://www.mydangerousloverboy.com/) . This uses the same clips as in the trailer. 

In 2009 [they state](http://www.mydangerousloverboy.com/meeting-with-minister-at-ukhtc-in-sheffield/) Grant Kier, probably the same producer the article above refers to, was actively trying to secure funding for their film.

The [NSPCC states](http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforprofessionals/sexualabuse/sexual_exploitation_practice_wda85129.html) that the music video was in fact produced in 2010. This implies they received said funding, and produced the music video.

As stated [here](http://www.mydangerousloverboy.com/my-dangerous-loverboy-update/) :        
         
*The MDL dvd is cited in the ‘Home Office Action Plan On Tackling Human Trafficking’, published in October 2009 as a training and educational resource for police, schools and practitioners.* Which is promotion of the video project, by those in the Home Office, for use in the UK

There appears to be no 20 minute film. In fact, there only appears to be a cheesy music video which has been re-edited in order to make a trailer found in the article above. The music video got its funding in 2010. It has since won one award and has been nominated for another and then shortlisted for another. 

#Conclusion
 
It is my personal belief that someone went to the Mirror and using the perceived racism/controversy surrounding this child-sex abuse horror as self promotion for their shit film. If you want to educate your child or anyone else about the dangers of sexual exploitation, the quality of the other videos in the NSPCC link are much higher. 

The police may and probably have been internally corrupt but this does not excuse lies, in order to promote your own poor excuse for a film.

true,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"It's so typical Everton isn't it, United and Liverpool fuck up in the same weekend so instead of taking full advantage we also throw it away and yes this was throwing it away. We could've scored another 2 in the first half before their penalty but no we just didn't have the players capable on the pitch really. 

Howard who's been nothing short of amazing the past year or so was horrid today, he has always had consistency problems but to go from Thursdays performance to this isn't acceptable really.

I honestly thought the back 4 were ok except Distin. I'm going to upset people with this but I don't want him playing for us in the important games, he's not too unreliable and honestly after last season it's obvious that he has some sort of attitude problem with the fans giving (deserved) criticism, I mean I guarantee he'd be the first player on twitter after a good game having a go at the fans for ""not always being supportive"". Stones I thought played well but was at direct fault for the penalty as well as Howard. He is a centre back and that's where he should play, I don't like Roberto playing players out of position and he does it quite often. Jags was good too certainly improved and Baines was basically just Baines but he didn't have a winger to link up with really so he wasn't as dangerous. Although Stones played well in my opinion at right back, it's really scary to me how much we do miss Coleman when he's out. Play down the right was basically non existent today and that is where we are most dangerous. I hope that he doesn't have to miss more games this year because we don't play nearly as well without him.

Barry and McCarthy were alright when they were playing midfield today, don't get the way we had to throw McCarthy RB when he's a great passer especially when it leaves Osman to fill his place. That's another thing that annoys me, why doesn't Roberto pick a subs bench that is useful for every position in case of injury or the like. McCarthy isn't a RB, Barry isn't a CB, what's the point of having only Alcaraz as the backup defender and if he's so dead set on it why not Browning or someone like that who'd be versatile in case of an injury for any of the back line. Baffles me really.

Osman is another negative. Again, like Distin he's just not good enough anymore to be near that team. I don't see how he's still picked, he gives the ball away so much and although he does shoot he always seems to try a ""spectacular"" instead of maybe just playing it in. I just don't think he's anywhere near good enough to be near the team. 

I don't really think Atsu is what we needed or wanted, he's seems to be like Geri only worse, he got a good few good runs in today but wasted them by either being selfish and shooting from an almost impossible angle or waiting too late for the pass. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt for today as it was his first full game but if this is anything to go on I wouldn't want us spending on his release clause at the end of the season.

Eto'o isn't a winger so there's no reason he should've been playing as one. If anything Rom should've been on the wing because although he did score today his general play sometimes is absolutely shocking, I mean he can't get some basic passes right. If next week wasn't the derby I'd be saying give Rom some time on the bench behind Eto'o to see if he'd become a better general player although really scoring isn't our problem it's just the defending.

Nice to see Gibbo back in the league I'd nearly say give Barry a rest because we can't expect him to play every game and throw Gibbo in.

Naisy looked good when he came on too as did Kev.

All in all it's a game we should've easily won and should've had it sealed in the first half but because we're Everton we of course have to throw it away. I don't know whether to be an optimist or pessimist for the next few games but we'll talk about those when we come to it.

I'd have to watch it again to really look for this, but our pressing just didn't seem to produce many positive outcomes. Perhaps it was poorly organized, and perhaps West Brom anticipated it well and worked harder to keep their passing lanes open and move the ball. 

&gt; We stopped playing out of defence through a main pivot (who we've seen was Capoue/Bentaleb in recent weeks). Kaboul, Chirch, and Dyer all returned to a long ball game out wide that allowed West Brom to drop, condense the middle of the park and wait out the possession.

I noticed that as well, I wonder why. Did Capoue and Dembele get dragged out of position by West Brom's players? Did they just lose focus on their assignments? Usually the centerbacks spread wide, the defensive mid drops deep to collect the ball and move it forward, but we just didn't seem to be doing that all that much today.

And yes, credit to West Brom. I thought they did very well to maintain their shape at the back, so that there were few gaps for us to run into, few opportunities for through-balls. I'm not sure if this was the ultimate cause of our struggles, or if this was an effect of inefficient movement and pressing that made it easy for them to keep a shape.

Getting a point out of that is a testament to Jose's tactics, despite what some of you think. You think they wouldn't have opened us up if we let them? Yea we might have scored a couple but they have superior firepower up front and superior strength and pace in midfield (not to mention Mangala and Kompany being rocks at the back). 

After the sending off, we did our job. We scored the goal. Now City had to come at us and that's exactly what Jose wanted. We almost scored a second twice (Costa really should've scored at least one of those chances).

My only criticism, and it's easy to say this with hindsight, is that we absorbed too much pressure when Ramires and Willian weren't on the pitch. Schurrle let Milner go and Bane was ball-watching. Individual mistakes that happen every once in a while. Shit happens.

People complain about the West Lothian question, but Scottish MPs number only 59 members at Westminster. You don't even need half of English MPs to outvote Scotland. But, if Westminster wants to, it could get rid of devolution tomorrow and that was by admission of the No campaign!

That is not an admission of anything secret, he's stating a publicly known fact. That's what it means to be a unitary state with devolution as opposed to a federation - ultimate power rests with the national government and can be redistributed down or up as they choose. The British government has made no effort to hide the fact that they can suspend any of the devolved institutions and impose direct rule given that they've *actually done it at least twice since the 70s*.

They could have done it before this independence talk got off the ground, or they could have denied Scotland a referendum on the subject altogether, all of this when most of Scotland was either largely unaware that it was a serious idea or outright against it. If this has been another country like Spain they probably would have done that. To do it now, when most of Scotland's population has become engaged in politics and nearly 38% of the electorate voted for independence would be a stupid mistake.

I think all of the following have either won or been nominated for Sony Radio Awards:

**Charlie Sloth. Hip Hop/RnB. Without a doubt the most talented radio presenter broadcasting today. Even if you hate his music with a passion he's just #1. Entertaining to no end, knows and gets along with everyone in his genres, enthusiasm for days, just an all round great presenter and his shows are always quality. **

Zane Lowe - Mon-Thu 7pm-9pm, focusses on new music, frequently energetic starts, into ""future"" sections, which showcase the best of up-and-coming new music that'll likely make it onto Radio 1's main playlists. He does a feature called ""versus"" every few weeks where he talks with someone in the music industry for 1 hour while playing songs against eachother. He's incredibly energetic, loves music, loves radio, seems to love the music he plays and has a mainly decent taste in music.

Pete Tong. Friday nights. He's pretty much the most influential figure in electronic music. Well respected by everyone in the genre, and plenty of people outside of it. He's been made MBE for services to music, primarily because of this show.

Annie Mac. Friday nights, queen of dance music, incredibly energetic, passion for music, plays what she enjoys. Sunday night ""bedtime"" show, to finish the weekend is probably one of the best shows on BBCR1.

Annie Nightengale. Incredible woman, been broadcasting forever, still has a slot on R1. Probably the coolest woman to have ever lived as far as I can tell.

Dan P Carter, Radio 1 Rock Show Sunday nights 7pm. Rediculously entertaining guy, used to be in the band A (did that song ""nothing, nothing"" and a few others). Gets good guests, focusses mainly on British Rock/Metal.

Radio 1 Stories (various presenters). Kind of like what you'd hoped BBC3 would have been when they announced it. Tackle incredibly complicated issues in a style that's fitting for a younger audience.

true,kittysaysmeownow,null,null,"Please don't be so defensive. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm just pointing out what my experience of this has been, as per the question asked. You can make of that what you will.

If you read back some of the comments on r/uk posts regarding the issue, you'll see what I mean. Many of the topics were absolutely riddled with 'I hope their country goes to shit' sorts of comments. And how Scotland was nothing without England, and various other ridiculousness. That was nasty, plain and simple. And a lot of people around me where I live have similar opinions. That's what I mean by nationalism, the idea that England is somehow more important than Scotland and how much better it is here and how stupid they are to even think of leaving, how horribly unsuccessful they would be without the might of England to protect them.

There were lies on both sides in the campaigns. Both were very polarized and both were obviously biased enough to mud-sling the other. But the comments and articles of the Scottish people seemed more calm and logical, while England comments and media leaned more towards  'We're better than they are!' and 'how could they?!' attitudes. 

Regarding your other attack, I know enough about the economy to choose England as one of my central bases. Why? Because I'm hoping the bankers won't shit in their own bed. Because I know the pound overrides the welfare of the people here, and that secures a better value for it. I definitely want my money and my pension in pounds. But being financially ahead due to a banking centre doesn't necessarily put a country on the economic cutting edge.

 There are a great many nations on this Earth that are well on track to surpass many aspects of England's infrastructure and technology, and industry to boot. If you can't see that, then you seriously need to have a better look.

The infrastructure here is lagging. I'm sorry but it's true. Please don't be so upset about that, I'm just a traveler who's seen a lot of the world and I'm just pointing out something I observed. To be honest the roads in Johannesburg are decades ahead of here. The plumbing in England is deplorable. You can't even have mixer taps or standard non-electric showers in many homes. No other 1st world country does this. Royal Mail and the rail system are also both subpar. 

There's a housing crisis. People here live in tiny rooms, in overcrowded housing, often desperately worried about wasting water and electricity due to the cost. Many houses are moldy and dilapidated, but their rent is still sky high. Obviously not everyone is in this situation, but *so many* people are. And the fact that, for this, they *pay double* what a nice, clean, roomy apartment in California might go for is just absolutely nuts to me. But that's the power of the pound again, and that's why my money is in pounds. 

There are similar and indeed worse situations worldwide, but things like that in a 1st world country so close to Europe are really surprising to me; I do expect more of 1st world European countries, and I especially expected more of such a world renowned nation. The pound will remain strong, but I'm not so sure about the welfare of it's citizens.

 Open your eyes and start using that bright brain of yours. The good news is this is totally fixable with a few smart, motivated (non-banking) minds.  If you don't take control, the pound bubble will eventually burst, and there will be no money left to fix the dilapidated infrastructure that was funneled away to keep it alive.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I suppose I would be in principle. I really struggle to be at all keen to change things though given how little it actually affects my life. I know republicans tend to bring up all this stuff that the Queen can technically do but the more I learn the more I realise that power is so meaningless as to basically be non-existent. The British constitution is filled with these sorts of weird technicalities - I can't remember which constitutional writer it was, maybe Walter Bagehot, who wrote that the British government could ban smoking in Paris and *technically*, because in the eyes of the British constitution parliament is supreme, it would according to British law be illegal to smoke in Paris. Of course there's absolutely no way to enforce that rule but it's *technically* true. The Queen's power is mostly like that - technically true but mostly unenforcible and not worth worrying about.  

With that in mind I just don't see the point in tearing up 1000 years of history and constitutional continuity etc. For what? What do I, specifically, get out of it at the end? Nothing as far as I can see apart from an colossal political clusterfuck where career politicians try and rewrite the constitution in a way that favours them. I won't save anything in tax because the civil list is more than paid back by the crown estate, land which would otherwise be in private hands; it's not like I have to do anything because I live in a monarchy that I would not have to do in a republic so I'm not going to gain any free time. 

In the meantime Harry is bringing the idea of an armed forces games to the UK and creating the Invictus games, the Prince's Trust is generally a good thing I think we would agree as is the fact that William earns a living like anyone else in the coastguard. That's how I see the monarchy in the future - earning a living probably in the army or elsewhere but fulfilling public and charitable duties in exchange for the maintenance of the palaces and a modest grant to pay for expenses incurred while carrying out those duties (which in turn generates some tourism). 

Sure the principle is a good one, no-one really deserves to be king or queen but it's not like we assign many other positions on what people deserve. Does Bill Gates deserve his billions? More than a poor farmer who works every day, all day just to subsist? Does anyone deserve what they get born into? I don't fucking know and broadly, I don't care because life doesn't work that way. You get what people give you not what you deserve. As a general rule we reward what we value in practice and enough people value the royal family (or more accurately, enough people don't see the value in getting rid of them) so they continue to exist.

By splitting ourselves up, and setting up these arbitrary boundaries, we make ourselves prey to those who are not tethered by those boundaries. Instead of having one united country who all work for the betterment of those people, we risk having a dozen different regions all competing against each other for the betterment of themselves. Whether it is making simply an English Parliament, and giving Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland more powers over taxation, or splitting England up into regional assemblies with similar powers over taxation, all we'll see is a race to the bottom, with different regions slashing taxation and public spending in an attempt to encourage wealth, with the general public losing out. I don't agree with the idea of splitting people up because they have slightly different accents, or slightly different political views, or were independent from each other X00 years ago. I agree with the idea of working together. It's ironic that the Better Together campaign has seemed to spark a Better Apart attitude in England. 

I've seen many arguments for devolution, most of which seem to justify themselves with nationalism or jealousy over Scotland. I think we need to have a proper discussion over this, not just say we need more federalism because Scotland is devolved. It seems a round peg for a square hole, and doesn't deal with the issue that even with more regionalism, people still elect populist and pandering MPs who have no reason to keep their promises.

I think that article is complete bunk as well. He complains about Labour trying to set up a more regional England because it allows them to hold power, then says England should be more devolved from Scotland to get away from Scottish socialism.

Are you wanting to remortgage the current home to a rental and buy a new home, but this new home will not be the forever home?

With BTLs, it makes sense to do them on interest only and put any spare cash into overpaying the residential mortgage as BTL mortgage is tax deductible but residential is not. The other riskier idea is put the profit into a private pension (after it's been taxed), so you get the tax back and build up a huge pension pot, you're both HRT so 40% of the btl profit will be taken.

I think we're likely to have a ""bad"" spell when we play all of Arsenal/City/Chelsea/Everton/(United?) in a very short period. But we'll come out eventually and then can possibly get back into it. I even have a bit more hope that Koeman could possibly get a better record against the top teams, because he might well be a bit more willing to chop and change his tactics.  

Take it game by game, and enjoy everything you can along the way. Ok it's only 5 games, but after 5 games we're the second best team in the league, and no-one would have bet on that!  ",0,1411325190,null,0,false,0,ckolkn2,t3_2h0iyv,t1_ckolkn2,t3_2h0iyv,null,1426891388,4,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,4
