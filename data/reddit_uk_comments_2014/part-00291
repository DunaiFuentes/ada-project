Lallana should have stared. He has the pace of markovic with way more skill. He is clearly match fit, and one of the best attackers we have right now.

I think balotelli is not mentally ready. He was offsides too many times. He needs to learn to pass if he comes out of the box aswell. I think he is a stationary player and he hasn't shown enough accuracy to prove he can be the outside the box sticker.

Sterling looks tired. We can rely on him every match and its about time he had a pretty poor game.

The defence was alright. Lovren is settling in and skertl was ok. Manquillo looked hesitant on the attack. I was impressed by Jose and mignolet.

Gerard is not a 90 min. Player and Henderson was ok. I liked to see Henderson drop back and help out Gerard on defense.

Go and put the kettle on. Make a cup of tea, come back once it's done. I'm not being facetious - a cup of tea will calm you down, it's scientifically proven. Or something.

Right. First of all, you won't be symptomatic less than a week after having unprotected sex. There's no ifs or buts about that - it won't happen. What is likely, however, is that given your pre-existing anxiety, and depression, a perfectly innocent mistake suddenly becomes an Earth shattering event.

You should be proud of yourself for getting to the Doctors to have some tests done. You didn't go into specifics in your original post as to what exactly you got upto in terms of sexy time shenanigans - don't post specific details if you feel uncomfortable, but the long and short of it is that it's more than likely that you're going to be OK.

Are you seeing anyone re: your anxiety and depression? Something like this can be a trigger - if you're got a pre-scheduled appointment with a mental health worker, ask if it can be moved forward. If not, ask if you can see one. If that's not an option, ask your GP surgery to speak to a doctor - if they try and fob you off, express to them you have mental health concerns and feel an appointment is important.

Despite what you may read in /r/britishproblems GP admin staff aren't robots; you'll find an appointment slot will make itself available.

tl;dr: It's significantly easier said than done, but **chill**. If you have concerns re your mental health get to your GP and explain to them you'd like to see someone about it. 

If you're on any kind of prescribed medication **DO NOT** change your dosage without consulting a doctor. Specifically SSRIs - from experience I can tell you that all that will happen is you'll wind up throwing up your insides, and feeling a thousand times worse.",0,1412197310,null,0,false,0,ckxtame,t3_2i0xga,t1_ckxtame,t3_2i0xga,null,1426731182,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The problem is that he shows this great dribbling and ball control when he picks the ball up in front of the defensive line, then has to fend off a player or two swarming him to get the pass off to someone else. 

That's a totally great ability for him to have and everything, but he *never* makes a run **behind** the defense for a ball along the ground like Sturridge and just about every other striker does.

Without the HRA, you would still be able to take cases to the European Court of Human Rights, just as you could prior to the HRA coming into effect (in 2000 I think?).  You would have fewer avenues to get the government to act in accordance with the ECHR, but they would still be required to by international law.  Pulling out of the ECHR would be a much bigger step.  The other complication is Article 13 of the ECHR:

&gt; Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.

I believe there have been some cases in which the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the pre-HRA situation in the UK violated Article 13.

false,ItsARacingSnail,lfc99,,"I'm going to ramble because I had a few pints during the game.

First off, while it's obvious that we miss the goals and chances that Suarez provided, we're also missing the Suarez mindset. I'm not sure if this is a tactical decision to keep our legs fresher, or just that we;ve lost the inspiration of watching our best player run himself into the ground every match provided.

Second, we need to rest our players more. Sterling looks gassed 30 minutes into every match, and though he continues to work hard you can see his fatigue in his first touch and final ball. Gerrard still has the ability to be a difference maker at this level, but not for 270 minutes a week even in his 'less physical' role. Hendo also looks like he's starting to get tired, which means he's been doing enough running to kill anyone of us.

Third, Balotelli. TBH I had my doubts when we were rumoured to be interested in him, and terrified once we signed him. His skill and ability is without question, but his decision making on the field is atrocious. First off, he holds onto the ball far too long, to the point of just refusing to pass it at all. For all those pointing out that he earns a lot of free kicks in good areas, I would argue that he just as often loses the ball trying to earn a free kick, by either trying to take on two or more men instead of playing the simple ball, or by pulling up and going over dramatically. So far the refs have been very hesitant to give him that many decisions.

A typical Balotelli spell consists of him receiving a pass, taking a few dribbles and then either trying to split two or three defenders, or take an ambitious shot. This mentality is particularly harmful to our team as the system that was worked best for us is one or two-touch passing and considerable unselfishness about who gets the goals. Now our young players are realizing that passing it to Balo probably means they won't get it back, and instead are looking at other, more difficult options.

I'm also a little concerned about his movement off the ball while we're in possession. He seems to quit runs after 3-4 steps if he isn't going to get the ball, and I haven't really seen him make any runs to pull defenders out of space for other players to exploit. Those kind of decoy runs are some of what Sturridge excels at.

I know I just wrote a ton about my frustrations with Mario, but I don't think he can't succeed at Liverpool. I just think that as long as he's stuck in a lone striker role, where he needs to find or create space against two CBs, that he will struggle.

Our defensive struggles are well known, and while I appreciate Mignolet's shot stopping ability, I hope the Valdes rumours are true so that we can get a keeper with more leadership experience. 

TLDR; We miss our high pace from last year, we should be resting players more so that we can keep up that higher pace, Balotelli's decision making has been poor.

I know this is all opinion, but I've been wanting to get it off my chest for a few weeks now.

We even ended the game having used only 2 subs too, which seems mental given how nothing we were doing was working. Use the options you have to try and Kickstart things.

The in game decisions were utterly terrible though. Coutinho was at least looking to play forward and be direct. He still had energy and was driving to drive us on. He was one of 2 players looking to really turn the game for us, and Rodgers yanks him instead of Markovic (who was poor throughout) or Sterling (who was basically a dead man walking, utterly gassed and his touch had left him). 

And then Lambert instead of Borini is confusing. Lambert isn't going to stretch play, it's not what he does. He's a worse version of Balotelli and having 1 static forward seems to be hard enough for us.

It's because people don't understand what it is designed to do and how it works.  You (and I'm sure many others on this sub) do get it, and you have explained it perfectly and clearly, but all a lot of people see is 

**NASTY PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO STAY IN THE UK BUT WE WANT THEM GONE, THIS CANNOT STAND**

Or

**PRISONERS HAVE MORE RIGHTS THAN WAR HEROS**

Which is complete nonsense.  Most of the time those headlines only reach the papers once they have reached the ECHR.  Our courts have dismissed them and the majority of the time ECHR dismisses them too.

Most Human Rights claims come under Article 8 (the right to respect for private and family life) prisons and deportees alike will claim their rights have been breached because they have been taken away from their family or their private life is interfered with.

[This](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271659/28027_-__Foreign_criminals_successfully_appealed_against_deportation_16-01-2014.pdf) Government report shows that between 2012-13, 2329 appeals against deportation were lodged, only 602 of them were granted and only 324 of those granted were on the grounds of Article 8.

So 13% of appealed deportations win on Article 8 grounds, not an insignificant figure but a it shows that the numbers are relatively low compared to what I imagine people think them to be. i.e. ""*we have no control over our boarders because we can't deport nasty people because of the Human Rights Act*""

Well as I have shown the figures say otherwise.  To further highlight this the [The Migration Observatory at Oxford University](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/deportations-removals-and-voluntary-departures-uk) published these findings.  Over 50,000 people were deported on immigration grounds and nearly 5000 foreign national offenders (i.e. people who reside in the UK but committed crimes abroad) were deported.

Our midfield is weak in depth right now, can't deny that.  Me, Im sitting our Gerrard, needs a rest, Putting in Henderson and Lallana with Lucas behind or I would strongly consider Jordan Rossiter in place of Lallana and move Lallana higher up the pitch.


(4-3-3)

Lallana - Mario - Sterling 

Henderson - Lucas - Rossiter 

Moreno - Lovren - Skrtel - Manquillo

EDIT:  Why not play Suso? The kid looks brilliant whenever he has came on

Play him in the midfield with Henderson and Lucas, he's super tidy with the ball

When you're already lumbered with a hell of a lot (tuition) that you're not really going to see through then things on top of it are arbitrary. You're already owing money, that you're probably not going to work off. The absolute figure doesn't really affect your day to day at all.

Forget the beer and social, but the by and large experience of growing up for some people is so worth it. When my company hired the next couple of student interns it was well and truly obvious which one had lived at home, not moved from their home city, and which one had moved away. There's a lot to be said for the social skills, and the way you approach things (i.e. how much of a deal you make it out to be). The confidence, and resilience that comes with living with a bunch of student slobs, however horrific. Student loans aren't necessarily the 'correct' way to facilitate this, but most 18 year olds don't get the opportunity otherwise. Heck, my brother still lives at home... just a complete lack of worldly experience, or how to deal with adult responsibilities. 

It's not a bad debt, and that really is the distinguishing point. I'm firmly with: if you can't afford it, don't buy it. I don't have an overdraft, and instead just manage what I need. I'm a lucky one with a grant though, not everyone is, but it doesn't give me much. The condition that you need to be in a 21k+ job isn't that bad. It kicks in at 15k for me, which sucks a bit more... but that's the previous deal.

We were having some issues getting forward and I thought we could have possible brought on another striker and gone for a 4-4-2 type of formation. While Lambert provides a big body I think the pace of Suso might have been what we needed to counter. 

Sterling was not on top form today and I think we can guess at a few reasons. He might be feeling the pressure or maybe he was a little worn down from all the minutes he has put in. It could be a combination of factors.

I was also a bit disappointed with Balotelli today. He had some good moments, but I took a few things away. First, he wanted to make too much a couple times instead of looking for outlet passes. He would dribble into 3 defenders and instead of passing to a teammate he would try to work his own way through. Secondly, he did not show the same work rate that he did in recent games. He was slow to get back onside a few times which meant that he was not an option to receive the pass. Lastly, he did not time a few vital runs well. He would get in a good position near the box, but when a good attack was building he would get caught offside. I wish I had a gif, but late in the game Gerrard played a great ball in and Balotelli would have had a great look on goal and went to early, getting called offside. Gerrard simply turned his back in what appeared to me as frustration. It could just be the team hasn't meshed enough yet, we'll see.

Overall not a terrible display, but there were quite a few mistakes made that may have changed the game. I am optimistic for the future, especially with the return of Sturridge, that we have the raw talent and once the boys start to mesh we could be a very intimidating side.",0,1412200416,null,0,false,0,ckxux1p,t3_2i0xqy,t1_ckxux1p,t3_2i0xqy,null,1426730425,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I don't know if the quotes were big enough to be a story the other day, but Martin Tyler mentioned before the match that Brendan said we were missing Joe Allen and his ability to keep us at the right tempo. Hearing that was a reminder of some of the baffling things BR said his first year in charge where no game had ever substantiated his point. 

Joe Allen has been, at his best, a terrier like CM who can, against certain sides, start a double team to win the ball back against a player. His passing is less incisive than both Coutinho and Henderson. His ability to bring the ball from defense to attack works maybe once or twice a match. That BR has decided to pretend Allen is what we're missing doesn't make me confident. And I've been behind BR since his first days. I knew his first year could be shit. I sat there patiently and watched it all. I was surprised like we all were about how well last year went. And I'm not surprised now that we've had trouble when we're missing 50% of our goals from last year. 

Ultimately I think BR has proven himself to be less of the man management guru than we all thought he was, between the resurrections of certain players and the pushing on of Sterling. Whether it falls down on him, the Committee, or Ayre, I think we watched the summer go by without picking up someone who can put away simple chances when they're presented.

Right now, outside of Sturridge, we have players who seem more likely to score wonder goals than to be clinical. A lot of us have put the brunt of blame on the defense, but, as shocking as it's sometimes been, we can't buy a goal right now.

false,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;Yes tax cuts will cost quite a bit more than JSA and so what?

It puts it into proportion, a lot of people are not aware of what proportion of spending is spent on out of work benefits, vs the massive amount spent on say, pensions.

&gt;The cuts need to be made in the face of the deficit, it sucks that librarys have to close along with police stations and post offices too. 

Why?

How does it make sense to cut services in a way that increases individual cost and reduce taxes, rather than say, increasing income through taxation and ensuring that those taxes are spent on the services we need? I mean, lets face it, there is little benefit to anyone if you give them £5 and cut services that they will have to spend £50 to buy in the private sector.

The point is probably that we should be talking about which services we want as a country, rather than simply swallowing the notion that all cuts are equal and that they are really urgently necessary.

&gt;Something to remember is that the government is not obligated to provide libraries for the people of this country. This is a privilege that the people of this country have that costs money at the end of the day to run and this country is in a lot of debt.

This country is in a lot of debt, however the current cuts will not reduce that debt, not in the short term, and likely not in the long term either. We are currently reducing the deficit, essentially, we are reducing the speed at which we accrue more debt.  Our debt today is bigger than it was in 2010 and it will be bigger still in 2015.

The other point of course is that the debt isn't actually a big problem for the UK right now. It costs practically nothing to borrow, much of that debt is owned by the BoE anyway (so we get the interest payments back...). Much of the remainder is owed to pension funds and the like, who want to invest in government debt because its safe.   In short, there are a lot of people out there who would like to give money to the government to invest now, in the hope that the government might in turn invest that in people and infrastructure so that we end up with a better and larger economy (and higher tax receipts and so on...).

In short, cuts aren't the only option, raising taxes is another, but instead we seem intent to reduce our income, and do so quite rapidly, at a time when we are also looking to reduce our spending... 

&gt;Why does it matter if it benefits those with higher incomes?

Because it has a smaller impact on the economy if you push benefits to the highest earners, the return is smaller. What is more, those on the lowest incomes are already in a position where they require additional support, reducing that saves all of us money.  I'm all for reducing taxes on those on low incomes, but surely it makes more sense to do it in a way that is tax neutral..

It's bizarre that something touted to help the poorest workers, will in fact benefit them less than those on the highest incomes.

I know I come into viewing Mario probably in a loaded way. We have preconceptions. But the fact of the matter is until a short 5-10 minutes starting late in the game, this was a game of very few chances. On two very positive breakaways he decided not to pass when the pass was quite frankly the only option by a mile. He chose instead to attempt to break through three players, with a dribbling intricacy he lacks. 

Mario is not a bad passer of the ball. He's shown this. Which is why it's incredibly frustrating. 

His shots from outside the box are difficult to stomach, but I expect if he scored more they'd be a lot like Sturridge's from out there. Sturridge takes a lot of shots that may seem momentarily dangerous but really aren't at all. 

The fact is we have no season to look at Mario where he's been a clinical goalscorer. He just hasn't been. For anyone. He has made his name on his antics and being capable of the incredible. But he's not shown he can make it work game in and game out.

I think the one thing you can say about Suarez and Sturridge is that not getting goals actually makes them angry. Their willpower made us what we were last season. Balo may ""will"" people off the ball and fight through on certain occasions, but he seems more inclined to attempt something incredible rather than to make the most sensible move.

You can definitely do it this way, but you might end up paying too much for postage and wasting your money.

The price boundaries, as long as it's letter sized, depend on the weight.

No, it can have serious consequences, depending on your job. A friend of mine was a care worker for disturbed young people. There was an incident where it was alleged that he used excessive force in helping to restrain a nineteen year old. This was probably not true, and almost certainly the allegation would not have held up in court. However because he didn't understand the processes, he accepted a caution - this meant that he admitted on record that he had committed a criminal act. This meant that he is very unlikely to find any work for the next few years where DBS clearance (Disclosure and Barring Service, the new version of the old Criminal Records Bureau checks) is required. This would affect a lot of jobs and voluntary positions.

I just watched Don Jon. For a film about porn addiction it has very little porn in it. I really like Julianne Moore so it was okay. Now I have a warm sleepy pup snuggled up next to me and am trying to decide whether to watch another film or go to bed. Lots to do tomorrow but films relax and make me happy. 

Also, I have cream soda. Should I have cream soda with OJ? I think yes.

As for Human Rights Act, the only reason to axe it is if they are not happy with how little control they can exert over us. As Bill of Rights won't benefit us, it'll benefit them. That's all there is to it. 

As for ECHR I'm glad we have oversight, stops the Government from stepping out of line. It overturns things like section 44 of the Anti Terror Act that allowed the police freedom to stop and search without any probable cause.

We still get to decide so much for ourselves. Cases only get to ECHR after we have opposed them and usually they agree.

We won so much last year because Sturridge/Suarez would make cutting runs behind the back line and someone would zip a pass up the middle to them. That needs to start again. Balotelli doesn't play that style and should be benched IMMEDIATELY once Sturridge is available. Also Lambert sucks, put Borini in as first choice replacement.

David Cameron is actually as good of a prime minister as any anti-conservative could expect, unfortunate about his skewed narrow world view, poor cabinet choices (or politically savvy?) and a party whose political ideology by definition benefits fewer people than the alternatives.

The best of their parties are probably Gordon Brown for Labour and Boris Johnson for the Conservatives (he's much cleverer than the media give him credit for, and has unusually compassionate ways of looking at political situations for a conservative).

A while ago I'd have said Vince Cable was the best Lib Dem, but he has said too many unforgivably provably stupid things since 2010.

Nick Clegg is likeable and has some experience in Government. A lot of the bad press he gets is at best unfair, and at worst just plainly untrue. The Lib Dem world view most closely matches mine, but their credibility has slowly been eaten away by poor individual decisions and bad PR.

I still have no idea how the Labour party collectively deliberated for months and decided Ed Miliband was the guy who looked like he has his head screwed on. What the fuck were they thinking?

In conclusion the person I'd most like to be prime minister is Gordon Brown, someone should tell Labour it's not too late to bring him back and show everyone that most of the bad stuff that happened when he was in charge was either a Blair hangover or forces beyond his control. 

There's an argument to be made that without his decisions we'd have been a lot worse off.

Our center halves lose their marks as soon as they have to reset. Never seen anyone so consistently poor at tracking their men. Unreal how poor they are. It's like they've received no defensive coaching. Although you wouldn't expect them to need to be told to stay with their marks. So much ball watching and standing still. I'm more shocked when we don't concede from set pieces.

Gerrard needs to be dropped. It's no longer ""he needs to be rotated."" He's a consistent drag on the entire XI at this point. Calling him a passenger is way too kind. He provides absolutely nothing defensively, and has stopped contributing offensively. At this point he's doing nothing other than handcuffing Henderson and exposing our back line to constant pressure from free roaming midfielders. He's at the heart of our problems on defense. He's my favorite player of all time, but he needs to be dropped. No one is bigger than the club. No one.


Balotelli is an impossibly bad fit for us. His skill is undeniable, but the intelligence of his movement is absolutely shocking. It might work at some clubs to have a striker that refuses to go near the goal, but with us it's just stifling the creativity of everyone around him. The game collapses as soon as we enter the final third through the middle with him at striker. There's just nothing there without anyone stretching the defense. Maybe he'll work well with Sturridge opening space for him, but he's the worst possible fit for us as a lone striker. The worst part is that he's easily our second best option behind Sturridge.


The most discouraging thing about watching at the moment, though, is the crossing. We look so much like the sputtering, impotent side we had with Carroll and Downing that it almost brings me to tears watching. It's just so painful seeing so much talent play so poorly.

Increasing taxation on the wealthy members of society is taking away money that is directly used in financial investments. Do you think wealthy people sit on a pile of cash ala Scrooge Mcduck? That money is typically sitting in an investment fund or used in assets to further boost economic activity. Taxation on the other hand most often takes the money and spends it on unprofitable but necessary services. A careful balance must be maintained between the two.

Reducing the deficit is a start on reducing the debt. Should be be raising the deficit and raising our debt further?

The current consequences of our debt is £43 billion a year in interest. The Bank of England owns about 25% of the debt according to:

I think it has to do with some of the criticism from last year; the team was seen as very raw, scoring goals but also conceding a lot. As a result, the team seems to view quick play as panicking, even when they *should* be playing quickly (counters etc.).

I think Nasri can be that guy when he comes back but I really think we need to look at bringing someone in. Sinclair isn't good enough. The best option would be Reus but that's a dream grounded more in fantasy than reality. Cuadrado would be a good buy IMO. 

I don't think Nastatic is an option right now. Not that he isn't a good player, he just lacks the pace to cover when Kompany presses high and leaves holes. Mangala is the perfect guy for that because he has freakish speed and can easily close down people. 

I also think we need a fullback to play on the left. Clichy was pretty bad against Roma. Kolarov is great going forward but can be slow coming back and isn't the best defensively. Problem is, I don't know who we could make a move for that would be able to be a consistent starter over either of them. Alaba would work but were more likely to convince Barcelona to swap Messi for Sinclair than we are of convincing Bayern to sell us Alaba. Maybe De Sciglio from Milan. He is super young but IMO is the best fullback in Serie A. 

And finally, Its time to plan to replace Yaya. The only players we could make a move for that could fill his role are Vidal and Pogba, both would cost a lot. I think maybe we need a tactical switch where instead of having a box-to-box beast we have Nando and Fey play together with Nando being the brick wall stopping counters and Fey playing it in to Silva and whoever we have on the wings, kind of like a regista with Silva being our trequartista. 

Sorry, It kind of got away from me there at the end and I got off topic. Whatever though, fun discussion.

Edit: thought I put this in but I didn't. 

In terms of the next game I think we should have Milner play on the left with Navas and Silva. I don't think Milner is enough of a threat on goal to justify taking off a striker most of the time but Silva playing as a wide midfielder gets us lopsided and takes away half of the field at times. I'm all for overloading the right side occasionally but if it is all the time it let's our opponents only have to defend half the pitch. If we do it when Clichy is in than we don't have anyone to switch the play to across the field who can create. I would also like Lampard to start over Yaya but who am I kidding, that isn't going to happen.

We used to have Steve Clarke in the defensive coach role when Daglish was in charge and we were a lot tighter at the back then.

I agree with your points on Balotelli and the crossing as well. Although I think Balo is a very good player, his style of play doesn't fit into the style of play that worked so well for us last season. Sterling, Coutinho even Markovic to an extent are playing it quick with fast passing and movement but Balotelli seems to stutter on the ball and counter attacks seemed to break down a lot when he had the ball. If there was someone like Sturridge, or even someone like Origi in the Balotelli role, I reckon attacks would be a lot more substantial. Simply put, Balotelli plays a different game from the rest of the attack and it is showing.

I don't think Gerrard needs to be dropped yet. He shouldn't play the amount of games he has been playing but he still is in the first 11 in my opinion. He's a great player and although sometimes makes mistakes defensively (although not as many as the centre backs and keeper) he still adds a lot. He shouldn't be in a double pivot with henderson, it hasn't worked and when he played alone as a pivot last season it worked a charm.

I think one of the biggest issues is Mignolet, he looks void of confidence and is in desperate need of competition (hopefully Valdes)

**Player Instructions:**

**Mignolet:** *Do not pull a Neuer, you're not Neuer.*

**Manquillo:** *Stay back, do not go too much forward, we desperately need to keep the net clean*

**Alberto Moreno:** *Be creative as always but try to focus a little more on defense now, like I said to Javi, we desperately need that net clean.*

**Kolo Touré:** *Show us what you're made of, you're our best tackler, heard what I said to Javi and Alberto? It's you business too.*

**Dejan Lovren:** *Focus on the ball, focus on the opponent and attack the player if needed.*

**Lucas Leiva:** *Try to stay as far back as you can, don't make hard passes, keep them short.*

**Jordan Henderson:** *Do what you do best, you're captain today and show us why you deserve that captain's band, if we're trailing, don't take stupid decisions like long shot attempts, it simply doesn't work. You're not just a CM but a DM and a RW too, tackle if you feel like you have to and try to back up Manquillo's job as a winger as I've told him to stay as far back as he can. I believe in you, you'll get 3 assists today.""*

**Lallana:** *You've been great recently, keep it up and it will deliver something beautiful eventually.*

**Philippe Coutinho:** *Be wherever you can but do not finish up your stamina by half time. If you get disposessed, work for the ball again. Show me those through balls you're capable of doing and you could get 3 assists today.*

**Daniel Sturridge:** *Welcome back from injury, welcome to the real world, do what you did the whole last season, shoot the ball when you get the chance too and if it's not a good chance, pass it to Balotelli or Coutinho, they are also capable of shooting.*

**Mario Balotelli:** *Balotelli, get yourself into more comfortable positions today, relax your mind, do not lose the shit if you go down, do not lose your shit if someone else goes down, a teammate or the opponent. If you follow all these you might score. I believe in you, you'll get a hattrick today.*

---------

**Team instructions:**

""Press, press, press, press, press and then press again. Get the opponent tired early. If you score, delay as you can in their own half, it will get them pissed off and when they're pissed off they get distracted and we could score again. If we are trailing or level in second half, do NOT pass the ball around the backline, fucking be creative throughout the whole match.""

----------

**Set Piece defending:**

Man Marking:

Mario Balotelli: Far or near post.

Kolo Touré and Dejan Lovren: Anyone who looks like getting the ball. Preferably Joleon Lescott or Dawson.

Coutinho and Lallana standby in midfield ready to counter attack.

Manquillo: Run around the box.

Alberto Moreno: Blocker, as close to corner taker as possible.

Lucas Leiva/Jordan Henderson: Strikers e.g. Berahino

Sturridge: Mid box, close to target. Ready to cannon the ball away.

You need only look at the fallout from the ""Reddit plays desktop detective"" debacle during the Boston bombers manhunt to see how people playing Sherlock can have a potentially devastating end result.

There's also the issue of how we treat others in society. How we treat those we despise reflects on us all. No one is going to go to bat for paedophiles. They're the monster under the bed; universally reviled.

One needs only look at the tripe that floats around on various social media platforms to see how certain sectors of the public think we should ""treat"" paedophiles.

I'm sure as all hell not going to defend anyone who goes out and downloads, disseminates, or produces, indecent images of children, no more than I'm going to defend Jihadi John and his merry bunch of Cuntrags.

But do we really want Joe Public - the great masses most of whom can't point to half the places in the world we're bombing the fuck out of; who take to Facebook to post illeterate rants about ""hanging fucking nonces""; who can be whipped up into a frenzy faster than Simon Cowell can manufacture Pop Acts with a shelf-life shorter than your average piece of fresh fruit?

Despite what the media might have you believe, we have some of the most rebust child protection measures in the developed world. Those measures are developed and deployed by experts in their fields, with the protection of the public at the forefront.

Naming suspected child sex offenders doesn't keep the public safe; it'll potentially lead to innocent people being harassed - and potentially killing themselves, and will lead those who are either already convicted, or offending, to cover their tracks.

The example that springs to mind is the sex offenders register - not a year goes past without calls for it to be searchable to the public, as is the case in [most, I believe] of the United States.

Putting those registers online wouldn't keep the public safe; far from it, it'd have an adverse reaction. Why, would you opt to fulfil your licence / probation requirements - i.e. register your address, occupation etc. for public scrutiny, when you could go underground.

That last point, pretty much sums up my issue with these vigilante groups. You might catch some nonces. Congratulations. Odds are you'll be tainting evidence that - if discovered via legal means could have resulted in a conviction.  But odds are you'll merely drive these people underground further, and potentially into situations that put the public at more risk.

From a technological pov? I've maintained ever since it started to become popular that TOR will be outlawed soon enough. That it has legitimate usages is of no concern; much like welfare recipients all users will be tarred with the same brush. 

My personal opinion is that we should leave this issue to people who are trained professionals, and who are equipped to deal with it. That means appropriate physical / digital evidence collection, appropriate legal means of arrest and yes - though it may seem far-fetched, appropriately resourced to **attempt** to rehabilitate these individuals, or at the absolute minimum, monitor them appropriately to ensure the safety of the public.

I've never been comfortable with the public taking the law into their own hands; hanging was taken off the legislative books for a damn good reason; we don't need have-a-go heroes encouraging Facebook users who can think ISIL is the name of the newest Simon Cowell production, to go out and play Pierrepoint.",0,1412206204,null,0,1412206415,0,ckxxp1h,t3_2i1a1x,t1_ckxxp1h,t3_2i1a1x,null,1426729082,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

It's just time for him to be an impact sub, or a cup player, to finish is career with dignity, and not known as a player who cost us games.

Whoever coaches the defenders needs replacing, there is just no teamwork and no understanding there.  Just dumping Johnson after Manquillo came in was a mistake, better to ease players in rather then throwing them into the fire.

I'm putting together an amendment to the submission rules to clarify the setup- if anyone feels they have a Breitbart post that really warrants consideration, a modmail's in order. We're pretty reasonable in what we approve- the chances are that a post'll be approved. Also, the mods tend to check the new queue at least a few times an hour, between us- we've got AutoModerator set up to notify us if anything at all is removed. 

If it's anything- *anything* more than a reprinted fluff piece or blogspam churnalism available elsewhere, we'll be overwhelmingly likely to approve it. The title of this post was, in hindsight, ill-judged- apologies for that. 

This business is, in large part, down to its' becoming a plague in /r/ukpolitics. If there's a significant backlash to this rule, however, we'd almost definitely be open to backtracking on it. 

I'm thinking we'll be recruiting one or two more moderators once we reach 1,000 readers, and be holding an open consultation on what we want for the subreddit's future, and considerations concerning the rule set- with, ideally, consultations being held every 1,000 subscribers thereafter. 

We don't want this place to be a dictatorship. Really. If there's a solid reason why we *shouldn't* do something, we're open to argument- and feel free to have that argument in public, rather than restricted to modmail, like in the other place.

I think this is the crucial part that most people probably understand but don't properly appreciate. We don't have human rights laws to be nice to people - we have human rights laws because every now and then government do really horrible things to people that don't deserve it. When Theresa May says that human rights make her job harder by making it harder to deport criminals etc she misses the point entirely. The only reason human rights exist is to make her job harder - to make her jump through certain hoops designed to ensure that the people the government deals with are treated well. 

The Abu Qatada thing was the perfect example. She was upset that she couldn't deport him but European judges AND British judges thought that given we don't allow evidence obtained by torture in UK trials it might be a bit...dodgy...if we send him away to Jordan where they can do it for us. The moment she told the Jordanians not to use evidence obtained by torture the extradition was perfectly fine. It turns out he was found innocent anyway indicating just how shaky the case against him was and why I assume May took too long to agree with the Jordanians to give him a fair trial because she knew that if given a fair trial he would get off and she would look bad.

Not only do we play weaker but our team looks weaker if the other team doesn't know who they are playing. You don't think Basel were shitting themselves over Balo despite his recent performances? They were on him all night and that's because they know everything about him. Nobody is scared of fucking Markovic or Enrique.

These people are going to be my in-laws, and all previous interactions (over Skype and email) have pointed to the idea that they are nice people, but now that we're working on logistical details of their trip they have been *so* fucking demanding and contrary I am just flabbergasted.  I asked what kind of cake the dad would like me to make for his birthday, and he said a Baked Alaska in the shape of a glider.  At first I thought he was joking, but...no.  I suggested that it was an old-fashioned recipe that really is not very tasty, and besides, he had told me he **doesn't eat eggs or 'anything with cream in'**, and Baked Alaska is essentially ice cream covered with eggs.  His reply?  ""That's all right, I'll just eat a little taste of the ice cream and push the eggy part off to the side.""  Wonderful.  Sounds like the hours it will take me to make it will be time well spent.

There's been other stuff, suggestions I or my family have made that they have rebuffed, the dad asking my brother to help get him a temporary flying license then completely flaking out on his end of the paperwork.  And again, absolutely no indication that anything was amiss or they didn't like me/my family until we started working on plans and logistics.

I thought the peanut butter thing was at least partially explained by the mom speaking on the dad's behalf (the dad is the big peanut butter fan, the mom is the one who wrote the email), playing the doting wife, making him out to be more fussy than he actually is.  But after this Baked Alaska conversation, I think you are right.  It would be unwise to buy them an equivalent.  There is no way they will be happy and they might even be annoyed.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Obviously tax cuts will be worth more for people whose income is higher because each percentage point of tax is worth more for them. 

Here's another way to compare the numbers:

Tax cuts for low incomes (those between £10,000 and £12,500) will be worth £5.6bn a year by 2020 and will affect over 1,000,000. 

Tax cuts for middle incomes (those between ~35,000 and 50,000) will be worth £1.6bn and will affect 800,000 people

There is not tax cut that will only affect the rich they will benefit will be the cumulative effect of both of these cuts because they will pay tax in both these bands. However that is always going to happen - you can't cut a lower band of tax for only one group of people because everyone above that also pays that rate up to the threshold. Everybody of any income will benefit from the personal allowance rise for example because then tax will only start being charged on money people earn after £12,500. This is precisely why as the BBC article I link suggests cutting National Insurance. 

I would prefer to see most income tax stay basically the same, NI cut, VAT cut, allowance increased to 15,000 which correlates with the living hourly wage paid for (if possible) by a wealth tax maybe on property or certain luxuries with a small increase in capital gains tax. I have no idea if that pays for itself but it seems more progressive and focuses less on income which is kind of a red herring if you want to make things fairer. Rich people don't get richer via income, they get richer by recouping interest on their investments so unless you tax those investments you will not affect inequality. You could exclude pension funds and public funds to avoid taxing normal people too much.

Southampton had like half their team taken and they are doing fine with replacements. This is only one example and shouldn't be treated as the above all and end all in the arguments, but the point I'm trying to make is that it isn't just only our new signings. 

We've been pitiful in the final third - terrible even - we lack any serious attack going forward without Sturridge (which I'm keen to see if it changes when he's back) and we struggle in the midfield without seemingly Allen to do the tuning with Hendo. 

Rodgers mentioned to all of us prior to the season in response to us ""doing a spurs"" and said that we've carefully selected players to ensure that doesn't happen. We know that it will happen to some degree, but we are still seeing very poor decision making and execution right now. We are seeing the likes of Sakho get angry (due to reasons unknown), we've seen the likes of Coutinho last night just walk off without a reaction to Rodgers and with Rodgers looking back in disbelief. We are in a stage where it's OK to be Frustrated. Stop saying it's a ""cesspool"" etc, it's really annoying. 

I'm not saying give up all your hopes and dreams for the club, but it's time to reevaluate how you think we will go. I personally will be surprised if we make it out of the CL group and I have us down for finishing 6th this year.  That doesn't mean I want any of our players to die, or want them to fuck off - those kind of comments are unwelcome.

I'd just like to see people play closer to Balotelli, particularly Markovic, For me i think he has the right idea but is out of form. Being compact in the final 3 is something which just hasn't happened this season, which i why i like the idea of Suso who tends to drift in instead of drifting wide and is likely to arrive (BRendanism) in the box. 

For a game like Brom who will be fancying themselves after their big win last week and our form.
A pragmatic approach is needed which is why i put Lucas in for Gerrard. Someone who is more inclined to do the basics and not take risks. 

Coutinho is a funny one. He looked good when he came on against Everton which is how i would play him in this game. I also reckon he is substantially better with players in front of him which dosnt happen if he's out wide in a 4-3-3. 

If things don't go well in the fist half i would not hesitate to rope in Lambert and go to a 4-1-3-2. None of this waiting till the last 7 mins stuff.

Our squad changes between games, but it's more a question of focus, for both the team and the coach.  Poch can't be prepping our squad to play an EPL opponent on the weekend when he's preparing and traveling midweek for a Europa game.  And our players, whether they start in Europa or not, can't properly prepare and focus all their energies and efforts on the league either, especially if the manager and most of the squad is off in Cyprus or the Arctic Circle or wherever.

I'm not saying we don't want to win it, but I think it's a lower percentage chance of winning Europa than coming 4th.  Finishing between 1st and 4th out of 20 sides is damn sight easier than finishing first out of however many damn teams there are in Europa, especially once UCL sides drop down after the group stages.

I think you're missing a very big point they bring up in the episode, and that's the WHY they want to fuse. They've seen humans survive too many times. They are the ultimate survivors. What is the goal of the Cult of Scarro? To ensure that Daleks survive at any cost. You have to remember that this is Dalek Sek's plan through and through. The Doctor has finally met a dalek who has realized that their is more to surviving then just destroying everything. That they will have to evolve, and what better way of doing it then to fuse with the species they have seen survive over and over again?

Mignolet - Manquillo Skrtel Lovren Moreno - Lucas Henderson Lallana - Coutinho Balotelli Markovic

Back 7 is pretty straightforward. Mignolet had his best game since the start of the season last night. Teflon Skrtel will keep his place because sakho is injured/""injured"" and Toure's not quite good enough. Lucas in for Gerrard is obvious, with Henderson and Lallana working in front of him its a good midfield.

The front 3 is where it gets tricky. I see the reasoning to use 2 strikers, but when one of those is borini or lambert its less compelling. People are quick to forget we played balotelli and borini up front at west ham and that was pretty much a disaster. In the end I've gone with 2 players who didn't play 90 minutes last night, for freshness reasons. Seen a lot of criticism but I thought markovic showed promise last night, while sterling was dreadful. Markovic carried the ball quite well and had his head up looking to link up, even though he didn't always execute  well.

I know opinion is split hugely atm but, for me, Mario's clearly been making an effort while trying to gain match fitness/sharpness and adapting to a new team.

Thing is, he doesn't fit our tactics. He's nothing like Sturridge or Suarez in his playing style yet, instead of changing our tactics to get the best out of him, we're trying to force him to be like the above. Never going to work.

The Anfield Wrap cast made a good point a few shows ago. Everyone we bought this summer seemed geared to a 4-3-3. Remy made total sense for that system as a Sturridge-type backup who could also play wider. Balotelli makes no sense for that at all.

If the plan all along was for the 2-up diamond to continue, we've wasted £20M on Markovic when we still needed another Sturridge/Remy type.

Longer term and indirect risks like pesticide and anti-biotic resistance, allergen trait transfer, etc. are still concerns.

More generally, on science: whilst the scientific method is still undoubtedly the best route to technological and other progress we have, it's foolish not to bear in mind that, in a wider context, science is not politics-free.

However, over the last few years, Audi drivers have become the worst by a LONG way. 

My reasoning is that as cars like the A3 / A4 have aged, they've dropped in price. This has allowed a new breed of scrote to afford what was a pretty high-end car a few years ago. Years ago an Audi/BMW was the sole domain of your average businessman / middle-manager. Now they are being bought by the orange skinned, tattooed, steroid filled, shaven headed, racist mouth-breathers that inhabit every town. 

The ease of getting cars on finance hasn't helped. A guy who could only afford a clapped out old Ford if he used cash can now get a fairly new Audi on monthly payments. 

The fact they think they have ""well good"" cars gives them a sense of entitlement that also means they are allowed to drive like fuck-spanners. 

My own personal experience on the road means that if I flash a BMW / Audi driver out of a side road, they aren't going to thank me. If a car doesn't want to queue at a roundabout, it's going to be an Audi/BMW that pulls off a stupid mid-roundabout overtake.

That in mind it becomes much harder to divide ""stretching the truth"" from opinion or mistakes. Most publications play to their readers world view in some sense, and everyone gathering information comes from a context. The Guardian sees sexism where it looks for it just as the Mail sees moral degeneration. Whether they are right or wrong is partly a point of view, and partly the greyness of life.

 £700 does this cover council tax and utility bills a mortgage wont. Remember when you own a property all repairs are down to you to fix no landlord to fix and pay for boiler issues and you have to buy building insurance which the lender will want proof of before releasing purchase funds. The lender will set out the minimum amount you must pay each month. I checked the the Halifax  online calculator using 20k as a deposit at 25 years at 5% interest repayments on a 120k loan from the lender was £701 for a 140k property was the closest I could get to your current rent price. Remember the initial rate they offer you will only last between 2-5 years then you either have to accept what they offer as a new rate or shop around for a better deal which might incur charges.  

Well its down to personal preference I've done bank first for the free health check on my accounts and what they can offer.  Then compared that offer with what mortgage broker can find. Now how you pay for that advice can either be a up front flat fee (never done this method so can give advice how it works) or the fee will be added onto the mortgage so every month you pay the fee as part of your monthly mortgage repayments.

MSE is a good place to start with battling through the jargon.

It looks like you write new paragraphs on the next line, which is making the whole things one solid block of text. That might make some people skip your post, which would be a shame.

Anyway, your points are all valid. I agree with them. Things like that make me roll my eyes whenever people say things like, ""Moffat makes no sense! There are so many plot holes! It was never like that with Davies! I miss the subtlety, and realistic characters!"" I'm not saying Moffat is perfect, or that people who prefer the Davies years are *wrong*, but come on, let's be fair.

I actually kind of liked Evolution of the Daleks. Yeah, there were some gaping holes, but others were worse, and at least there were some neat ideas in it. I still wish those themes were presented in a better story, though. Let's take ""New Earth."" I thought *none* of it made any sense, and the whole thing is solved with The Doctor mixing together ALL the medicine like some kid with a toy chemistry set, creating some kind of reverse plague that makes everyone better. Heck, the whole first season ended with Rose trying to hot-wire the TARDIS, accidentally turning into a wizard, and erasing all the bad guys. ""Bad Wolf"" was a huge let-down and a horrible ""mystery.""

So... at least exploring the ideas of the Daleks having to choose whether to adapt or die was interesting, even if it went nowhere.

The good news is that the good outweighs the bad! If you're watching sequentially, you're in season three, and coming up in a bit is the two-part ""Human Nature/Family of Blood"" and immediately after that ""Blink."" In my opinion, they're the best three episodes ever aired in a row. (Unfortunately, I also have some things to say about the season finale, but I don't want to spoil anything.)

And I know this risks getting some people riled up, but once Moffat takes over, the amount of actively stupid things goes down to *almost* zero. No, not everything makes sense or has a satisfying conclusion, and some people prefer the style of previous episodes, but I can't think of anything outright *dumb*.

Not really. Chavs would probably be closer to a kind of urban redneck culture in the US involved in petty crime and anti-social behaviour. We don't have a juggalo equivalent as such in the UK.

&gt; I would also like to know more about other British underclass.

Similar to the US underclass although less segregated along racial lines. Feral and involved in crime as a career choice rather than just as a form of entertainment, unlike the Chavs for whom crime is entertainment.

&gt; How you deal with immigrants, people of color, other white non-English people etc.

Immigrants aren't treated any particular way as the UK has a rather strange and unsustainable policy on immigration that technically entitles every single citizen of the European Union to settle in the UK should they so wish, plus smaller scale immigration from around the world including the former British Empire which since the Second World War has meant that we have a quite diverse and wide variety of immigrant groups that have had varying levels at success of integrating. 

We don't use the phrase ""people of color"" in the UK (and indeed to do so could be construed as racist) but instead refer to ""ethnic minorities"" or ""minority ethnic"" if you want to be overly politically correct. The UK still has casual and institutional racism to some degree (e.g. it's harder to do everything from get a job interview to hail a taxi cab if you're black than if you're white) but fortunately very little of this seems to be residual old school racism and more seems to be about cultural expectation which can be overcome through exposure.

Non white English people are also not really treated any differently for the most part but are judged on their behaviour rather than their accent.

&gt; Sorry if none of what I write is grammatically correct. It's the internet and not a paper for the prof. Dialects and writing styles of our nations are wide and incredibly varied. 

That's okay, it's actually inadvertently hilarious and I've upvoted every single one of your posts in this thread.

&gt; Plus the English are dicks. 

Good job *you're* not racist! Why on Earth would you think that over 50 million people are dicks? 

&gt; Usually considered well traveled if they have been to Amsterdam AND Ibiza in their life. 

*travelled

Seriously, no Englishman would think someone was ""well traveled [sic]"" for having been to Amsterdam and Ibiza. Although it may be that some Chavs would consider those two destinations as their primary destinations were they to travel abroad, Ibiza more than Amsterdam though. To experience Chav culture you could do worse than visiting the nightclubs in Ibiza.

He has shown a willingness to learn and for me, a willingness to change the way he plays from a selfish style to one that benefits the team. When old players start performing to their previous standards and new players become more fluent in the system, Balotelli will get more chances to finish. 1 goal in 7 games is hardly terrible when you consider the team as a whole has scored only 6 in the last 6. He plays differently to Suarez, no doubt, and it's a case of our players adapting to him as well as him adapting to them, but don't judge him until he has a half season under his belt. 7 games in to his Liverpool career, calling time is just knee-jerk. The few times we got Manquillo behind the defense last night on the wing it was Balotelli who held the ball up, drew defenders around him and laid the ball off in to the space vacated. Poor delivery in to the box/ offsides-a-plenty meant they never came to anything. Having Balotelli drop deep when we have Sturridge on the pitch who *always* likes to run in behind is going to be far from a bad thing. He will drag defenders out of position, making holes Sturridge will love to fill (hurr durr) and he's already shown he likes playing those dinked balls over the top of defense with his back to goal.

false,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;And what does it matter if JSA spending is small compared to pensions?

It doesn't (and frankly it'd be alarming if the cost of JSA was anything close to pensions) but like I said, there is often a misunderstanding about what the welfare budget pays for, and what proportion goes to what.

&gt;Pensions are given to those who have contributed to the state over their lifetime. JSA is given to those able to work but not in work.

JSA is largely paid to people who have also paid in, it's usually a bridging benefit, something to tide people over for a short period whilst they are between jobs.  Indeed the bulk of the expenditure is on contribution based JSA (which makes sense given it's higher..).  It's the classic spend to save benefit, if it wasn't paid out we'd see significant additional costs and obviously it'd be harder to get people back 
into work without it and other supportive benefits.

&gt;It's meant to be tough to motivate you into getting a job. If it wasn't very many people would not work.

It's supposed to provide support to allow people to get back into work. The whole 'tough' element isn't exactly sensible, it should be (and broadly is) designed to ensure that people don't sink if they don't have to. It's not supposed to be a motivator for employment (otherwise we'd just not pay it) it is there to ensure people can get back into work and that when you lose your job, you don't suffer additional issues that prevent you from getting work again later (like not being able to travel to a new place of work, not being able to eat etc..).

&gt;Increasing taxation on the wealthy members of society is taking away money that is directly used in financial investments.

Indeed, but not all financial investments are equal, not all result in a benefit for the UK economy and some arguably cause harm (the arguments about house prices for example).  You are right though, you don't want to push taxes to the point where they cause more harm than benefit.

&gt;Taxation on the other hand most often takes the money and spends it on unprofitable but necessary services.

Taxation spent on services and infrastructure can and often does act as a multiplier and enables additional economic activity too.  The point being that it should be spent effectively and in the right places. The services are also generally more likely to benefit the UK directly (they tend to be spent within the UK...).

 &gt;Reducing the deficit is a start on reducing the debt. Should be be raising the deficit and raising our debt further?

We are increasing our debt further at present. But yes, a long term aim should be that we do not spend more than we take in in tax receipts when we are in a decent economic situation, and preferably set aside and invest so that we have additional finance available when need it in poorer economic times. Essentially, when there is a failure in the public sector as with the banking crisis, the public sector should be able to increase its impact on the economy to prevent the kind of catastrophic downturns that we have seen in the past.

&gt;It's quite possible that something could help the poorest workers and benefit them less than those on the highest incomes at the same time. It's not a zero sum game.

Absolutely, but if the aim is to benefit the poorest workers, then it is incredibly inefficient to spend large sums of money that only have a minor impact on that group, and have an large impact on the groups that currently don't need that help.",0,1412242512,null,0,false,0,cky9os8,t3_2hztza,t1_cky9os8,t1_ckxxaa5,null,1426722214,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

Especially considering how many businesses have been left to slide here. They also love spending money on ridiculous projects that in no way need doing whilst totally neglecting things like roads, some of which make the surface of the moon look like a pool ball. There are roads on this island that haven't had any serious work done on them in close to 50 years. There's so many patches on them they look like a washboard.

Then there's [this](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/30/11) which is just embarrasing no matter what way you look at it.

The problem with the politicians here is that they almost always win on a platform of being a fairly well known and liked person in the community, not necessarily qualified for the position in any capacity at all, in many cases so unqualified for it that they're either a total embarrasment or quite dangerous. Proof of this was the last general election here where in the constituency I used to live in, the front runners were a guy who was a building contractor and a bit of a knob but put up a good front in public, and a secondary school teacher who has a degree in economics, had studied politics and seemed like a perfect candidate, but wasn't all that great at public speaking. You can guess who got elected and who is now utterly despised by those that elected him. The people here are a gnats ball short of fucking retarded at times.

They also leave almost everything to the very last minute. They only tried to renegotiate the VAT sharing agreement with the UK about 6 months before it was due to run out and by that time the Conserative majority government in London was in full cash grab mode to try and shore up the UK economy, so we got shafted by complete incopetence from our side once again but they still manage to spin it so it sound like Cameron was the bad guy.

Yes, though for poacher style strikers this is less true. Soldado is a poacher style striker, so it is even more likely he'll be judged on his goalscoring, as he doesn't have other parts of play that Adebayor does have. Quite frankly, adebayor's dribbling, control and passing are all better than Soldado's. Obviously an opinion, but one which I think is backed up if people watch both of them play. 

They're different styles, and personally I think Ade can sometimes be a bit shit in front of goal, but we haven't got another striker who brings the other aspects to his game so well. He also will let his head drop, after about 50/60 mins if things aren't going his way, which is why I think him being vice-captain is weird.

Soldado's game is all about hustle and bustle, catching on many opportunites, movement in behind defenses, latching onto scraps and trying to snatch a shot away. If that part of his game isn't going well ( which it wasn't last season, and I've not seen much to suggest he's turned it round this season) then he doesn't offer much.

Last game Adebayor was shit though.",0,1412243210,null,0,false,0,cky9sul,t3_2i030t,t1_cky9sul,t1_cky47mx,null,1426722163,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The #1 problem most victims of abuse have is that they are not believed. They're not listened to, people think they're making it up. Look at Bill Roache. 6 independent women came forward as victims, but due to lack of evidence Roache was found not guilty.

But if you were a betting man, and took the most generous false reporting rate of around 15%, the likelihood of 6 false accusations is 0.15^6 or 0.001%. Or another way, 99.999% chance there is some truth to the accusations. A more realistic rate of false accusation is around 2%-4% but then we get into silly statistics territory.

High profile people have the money and the influence to get the best legal defence and walk away, this is the way the UK legal system is geared and is made worse because of the cuts to the police and cuts to the CPS budget mean the state doesn't have the time or resource to build strong cases.

But until the alleged attackers start taking the 'liars' (which they don't call them because they would be open to civil suit) to court for slander / libel, I will carry on calling them victims.

People act like the battle to moderate Christianity has been won and that Christianity is now a peaceful religion - which does a massive injustice to the 1000s of people who are still being oppressed under the cause of Christianity (whether it is homosexuals being outright executed in the Christian African states or simply a teenager having to repress their sexuality because their parents are fundamentalist Christians).

The fact is that whilst yes we've made good progress to tone down Christians, the reality is that Christian bigotry is still quite rampant - its just much less reported because why look in the mirror at our actions when we can just scapegoat ""those other people"".  And that's the problem, what-about-isms don't make a good argument for saying why Islam isn't that bad, but in this case what is actually being highlighted is that we are focussing on blaming society's ills on other people when in reality the ills of society are the fault of society as a whole collective unit.

false,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Why do you assume that no-one earning the same money as you put so much effort into a miserable job? 

I never said that I make such an assumption.  It was just for me, it wasn't worth the effort.  I have a better quality of life earning less money, working less hard.  One of the most fun jobs I ever had was working as a KP, basically smoking pot (this was before the smoking ban) in the arse end of this god awful kitchen, that made awful food, for pensioners who I think had lost all taste buds anyway.  All we did was piss about, steal orange juice and earn minimum wage.  No stress, no responsibility.

I would go back to that in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the difference in money.  Money is what has allowed me to do so much more, to travel, indulge in hobbies, have a stable place I can call my own, and many of the other things I want in life.  The problem is that often jobs 'cost' these other costs, relationships suffer if you are constantly being sent to another time zone, working very long hours you can lose that intimacy that spark, it may never return.  These are the things you often end up trading for more money.

If you have people that have a choice, then you have to squeeze them gently.  For me it was, I could work another two weeks, and I'd have as much money as if I'd just worked 3 days at a lower threshold.  I can't be bothered with that.  What difference to my life does it make to work 6 months, and have say £50k in my pocket, vs working 12 months, and have £60k?  When I looked at incidental costs for what I was doing they were huge too, after all it's not just tax that is a necessary deduction from your pay packet.

Meanwhile, the same time, the exact people who are net beneficiaries of this system start decrying you as somehow being the cause of their problems, all the while never looking at the sustainability of their entitled behaviour.

&gt;Tax-wise it's unfortunate for the country that you felt that way.

It's the Laffer Curve effect.  For me, I can't take the idea of losing more than two thirds of my income in taxes, more so when living in London that amount of money doesn't really make you rich, someone who bought my flat 15 years before me, would have only needed to be earning 20p rate level of tax.  London is a great example, to live alone in my flat, I need to earn a 40p+ amount of money, to cover my bills and most importantly, my mortgage.  The lady above me, had hers bought for her 15 years ago by her parents.  She pays less tax, but will have more money left over at the end of the month after bills, housing etc.  If you start to feel that the system isn't fair, imagine how hard it is to work in that system when facing 68%.",0,1412245950,null,0,false,0,ckya9lw,t3_2hzg8i,t1_ckya9lw,t1_ckya1jg,null,1426721943,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The insertion itself was relatively painless, although the anathetic did pinch a bit. It's all just a very weird sensation having it inserted.

The longer answer is that I find it very hard to believe that the mortgage offer would be removed due to an extra £100 of outgoings, which are covered by a £300 payrise.

It sounds like a systems error. They should not really have re-credit checked you within a short timescale, as the system will see the automated credit check from before on there too, compounding the issue.

Methinks you are being told porkies by the broker or lender that you are dealing with.

Solution: Complain until you are blue in the teeth. Kick up a fuss, lay out your complaint in the same way as you've laid out this post. Demand a real person look at it and take a common-sense approach.

As soon as somebody with an ounce of common sense looks at the situation, they should overturn the decision. 

That is, as long as what you've listed is the full story.

It may be that the bank's lending policies have tightened since the original approval, or that you now represent a slice of the market they are no longer interested in, or a number of other commercial reasons, but to pin the removal of the offer on your credit rating sounds like a cheap excuse.

The year (2012-2013) earlier we played more possession oriented football. But that changed with the arrival of Coutinho and Sturridge and Rodgers changed us to a Counter attacking team. That worked out very well for us, since Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling were great in their movements. 

Now that Suarez has moved on, we are neither playing good possession oriented football nor counter attacking football. But that was bound to happen. We changed the philosophy last year to get the best out of the team. We will have to change again. It will take some time.

 Having said all that, I still believe Rodgers will make the team much better. Give him some time. He was the one who saw that Counter attacking worked better for our team last year and changed to that. In a couple of months of time with some tweaks, we should be doing much better.

Even after a month, you are at full liberty and within the law to request a meeting to discuss payment freezes and the such.

The APR has to be quoted by law by money lenders, regardless of whether you are borrowing £1 or £1 million.

To put it into some real context, say you borrowed 20 quid off of a friend for petrol if you forgot your wallet. Next week, you meet him for a pint down the pub and buy him a beer for £3 and give him his £20 back in the process. You actually just paid 143,000% APR. That's why APR is a stupid way of actually governing pay day loans, it's unreal to even attach any real figure.

So in that sense, limiting the speeds to 70mph is definitely the safer option. The slower you drive, the more control you have of the car and the more time you have to react to unexpected hazards. 
You also have a greater chance of surviving a crash.

A large part of the reason the APR is so high is the very short term nature of the loans means they have admin which costs them the same regardless of whether it is a 2 day or 2 year loan. Many bank loans, mortgages etc would have an obscene APR if their arrangement fees were only spread over 2 days. 

Now allow for the amount of the loans being much smaller, so they're also recouping fixed costs which are much higher per £1 borrowed. 

And consider how high the proportion of borrowers never repay the principal. And then there's the high probability in having to incur costs chasing debts, a cost which is likely similar regardless of the amount of loan. 

They have to make a big margin because they incur a lot of cost and risk per £1 per day of money lent.

                                Lambert for Sturridge
_____________________________________________________

The diamond is back, which allows much more protection for Stevie up the back, allowing him to play a more comfortable role. The linking up of Sturridge and Balotelli will insert more venom into our attacks. Sterling is rested.

**Mignolet** --&gt; When on top of his game he can be super. Be more vocal in organising the backs, particularly in set pieces.

**Manquillo** --&gt; Promising, work hard on positioning in both attack and defence, will not push forward as much as Moreno.

**Skrtel** --&gt; Often erratic, though his last ditch challenges are solid. MUST focus on postioning, shouldn't rush the play if he doesn't have to.

**Lovren** --&gt; Organise the backline. Starting to settle well, communication is key

**Moreno** --&gt; Provide support in wide attacks (within reason). Link up with Lallana who will cover a lot of ground. MUST get back after forward runs.

**Gerrard** --&gt; Build up play comes from Stevie G. Simple passes, provide support left and right. Will be subbed 60-65minutes in, must make passes and challenges count.

**Henderson** --&gt; Heart of the midfield. Has the legs to run all day, must be energetic and press hard. Give opposition no time on the ball. Play slightly more defensively than Lallana, support Gerrard.

**Lallana** --&gt; Like in the derby, cover all ground. Provide many attacking options, linking up with Coutinho. Link the backs with the forwards, communication is key.

**Coutinho** --&gt; Has provided energy to the lineup when coming from the bench so will start. No silly shots, put in 100% and be rewarded. If not going to plan will be subbed for Sterling at half time. If performs well will be replaced by Sterling when fatigue sets in.

**Balotelli** --&gt; Hasn't delivered the goods, but is on the way. Being partnered with Sturridge will mean less pressure. Must communicate, if all goes well this can be a deadly partnership.

**Sturridge** --&gt; Must do what he does best. Make piercing runs, knows Coutinho's game so will add fluidity into attacks. Subbed at 80mins, avoid aggravating injury.

A better analogy in this case is six people have claimed Roach stole their cars 30 years ago, but didn't bring the matter to the police at the time and have no paperwork confirming they ever owned the cars. 

It's completely unfair to go around calling Roach a thief in this case and the six people victims, on the premise that ""six people couldn't have all lied about the same crime, one of them probably is a victim of theft.""

&gt; Now, recently my missus and I decided that over our anniversary (5!) we would take some time off and fuck off to Prague for a couple of days, see some sights and drink some beer. Having decided it was time to book it, the other day we had a look at prices and were dismayed at how expensive Prague had become. Seriously, for a couple of days you're looking at a minimum of 250 quid each without food, drink, travel or anything. For that, we can book a 4 star package in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia) with everything thrown in for a whole week and actually get some sun. So, I came in the next day, and asked him for some suggestions. 

a) Congratulations, it was the mrs and I's 3rd anniversary yesterday... somehow lol

b) isn't being in Europe good for holiday prices?! ... No thought not. Feck off somewhere warm mate, easier!

I actually agree with you that the speed limit should be appropriate for the road design and prevailing traffic and weather conditions, which means that in some cases, 70mph is actually too low, when you take into account modern roads and cars.  On the other hand, there are plenty of places, particularly in urban/suburban areas where the current limit is too high.

Do you have any stats to back up your claim that more accidents happen 80mph than at 70mph?  I would guess that if you were to actually look at the stats, then most accidents would happen at much lower speeds than you would imagine, many at junctions/intersections.

I used the case of France deliberately, as they take a common sense approach on the Autoroute - 130kph in the dry, 110 in the wet.  Their limits in many built up areas are also quite a bit lower than ours - 30kph (18mph).

Universal credit scores are a myth. If you are paying Experian for yours save your money, it's a pointless product.

Each lender has a balanced scorecard of credit lending requirements, and checks a credit record against these. A great grounding in credit scoring [can be found on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score)

A mortgage provider will have an automated credit scoring system in the first instance which will provide a range of results, say scoring your application (combination of earnings, LTV, outgoings, credit rating) out of a notional 100, in terms of confidence.

The bank's policy may be to only do minimal checks on those scoring over 90, full checks on those scoring 40-90, and refusing those scoring under 40.

The point is that by default a refusal will probably not be looked at by a real person unless it is queried. 

Generally speaking, when dealing with the high street banks, the local branch manager will not have a huge amount of sway, as most lending decisions are centralised. Getting the local branch on your side will help, though, as they should know the right people to speak to.

Be polite, explain your situation, get them on side, ask them to help you. If that doesn't work, ask them to treat your comments as a formal complaint. ",0,1412253686,null,0,1412253943,0,ckyc2hh,t3_2i2vhl,t1_ckyc2hh,t1_ckybj4x,null,1426721102,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

&gt;

&gt;A __credit score__ is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the [creditworthiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditworthiness) of that person. A credit score is primarily based on [credit report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_report) information typically sourced from [credit bureaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_bureau).

&gt;Lenders, such as [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank) and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [bad debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_debt). Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate), and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [identity scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_scoring) prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [trusted system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_system).

&gt;Credit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Credit scoring also has much overlap with [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), which uses many similar techniques. These techniques combine thousands of factors but are similar or identical.

I used to work in FE and we had a group of German trade students from Berlin come over every year in an exchange. The British kids were just embarrassing compared to them.

The Germans all had their colour coded uniforms (and some were saving up for their journeyman's zunft, which are hysterical) for what trade they were studying and looked professional. Most of the British kids just turned up in some crappy tracksuit bottoms. 

Their courses are 3-4 years long and they don't get certified to work on a jobsite without finishing their course, period. By comparison you can basically buy a CSCS card on the internet and get on to a jobsite in the UK. FE colleges are constantly having to deal with kids dropping out of their Level 1 or 2 course because they've got a job with no real thought about what they'll do when they're older. 

The courses themselves are way more well-rounded than ours: they study maths, German, English, physics (!), chemistry (!), civics/history (!!), etc. Most construction courses half-ass teaching GCSE maths and English. For most of them, their English skills were scarcely worse than the British kids.

I don't blame our kids because they aren't told any better. Construction here in this country is very much a dump for working-class kids, especially those with any hint of not being bookish. It's a job and a way to earn money and at no point are they really told to be proud of what they do. You get some kids who take it really seriously and therefore have great skills and presentation, but it's 90% by their own initiative.

But you can see the seedlings for British construction's terrible reputation, and you can also see the seedlings of how German trades are some of the most reputable in the world. It's a profession to them and it really shows.

I am a 'lady of leisure' at present and due to health issues little exercise (the shame given I am a health professional by trade!).

Tend to tan very late afternoon so my morning products have worked their magic and I can begin the evening routine.

Skincare routine is all over the place timing wise but I'm thinking of trying a twelve hour system since I don't have a workday schedule to factor in.

Currently cleanse OR tone (one morning, one after tanning or later in the evening) then sometimes apply a chemical exfoliant. If used: leave that to do its thing in for up to an hour.

Next layer is some sort of serum or treatment product, again left for up to an hour. Lastly moisturiser but no sunscreen. Make up only for nights out.

2011-2012 (PDF)](http://www.nmc-uk.org/Documents/Annual_reports_and_accounts/Nursing%20and%20Midwifery%20Council%20Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202011-2012%20and%20Strategic%20Plan%202012-2015.pdf):

After scrolling through a shitload of diversity reports and blatantly manipulated membership graphs that look like something out of /r/Bitcoin, we finally get to, Section 6 Financial Review.

&gt;The net outgoing resources for the year amounted to (£8,410,000) (2010-2011: net incoming resources £7,751,000). 

&gt;The reserves of £41.7 million at 31 March 2012 include the value of the lease of the Council’s offices at 23 Portland Place, which contains a restrictive user clause. The lease was revalued on 31 March 2010 on an existing use basis at £13.75 million. 

&gt;During the year income totalled £52,781,000 (2010-2011: £52,467,000) and comprised fee income of £51,581,000 (2010-2011: £51,397,000) and investment income of £1,200,000 (2010-2011: £876,000). 

&gt;During the year expenditure totalled £61,191,000 (2010-2011: £44,716,000). This is further analysed within note 11 to the accounts. 

&gt;The increase in expenditure in 2011-2012 was driven primarily by increased investment in fitness to practise activity, to manage an increased level and complexity of cases. A deficit was planned for 2011-2012, consistent with maintaining adequate reserves as required by our reserves policy. 

Your figures are slightly off, but not completely out of the ballpark, good guesstimations! 

Essentially they claim that most of their spending and the reason for spending increases is due to increased claims of member malpractice and their need to investigate these claims, they neglect to mention that their nice shiny offices in central London for the directors are the single largest expense.

Also looking at Section 7 Remuneration report we see:

&gt;Council members do not receive remuneration for their services **but receive an annual
allowance of £12,000 based on the requirement for members to spend two to three
days per month** on NMC business.

This doesn't even include expenses, which are paid on top:

&gt;Allowances paid to Council members in 2011-2012 amounted to £200,000 (2010-2011:
£204,780)

And also:

&gt;The Chair receives an annual allowance of £48,000 based on the requirement to spend two to three days per week on NMC business.

This demonstrates the basic concept of ""file weight VS computational power"" tradeoff where the gif codec is very lightweight and easy to read (it's essentially arrays that tell what color a pixel should have on what frame).

Anybody who is careful enough will never have to use these providers, those who aren't will find other, even more nefarious means of acquiring the money needed if these companies weren't available. **EDIT** I'm not condoning it, far from it. It's a little disingenuous to slate them when they are in fact, abiding by the law. It's not their fault if the law isn't stringent enough. Enough people complain about them and they clearly state all the terms and conditions and what to do if you can't pay (at least the ones who can be trusted, do). They can't be blamed if people don't read it.

Pay day loans companies are becoming more regulated. They now have to be careful who they lend to and how much. As I've said, some pay day loans companies will freeze all interest after 60 days if payments haven't been fully repaid. As a consumer, you are also welcome to talk to them to negotiate repayments and by law, they have to oblige. Not to mention, if you default they never get paid so it's in their interests to negotiate.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just pointing out that these companies are registered and legal financial providers now. They have standards they have to meet, lest they suffer the consequences. One could easily argue the case for unplanned overdraft interest rates being equally punishing but few people bat an eyelid because it's a bank. It doesn't mean they they acquire the money any better. Often, it's worse because it's an account you hold with them, they can easily take any money they want quicker than any business could.

To be honest, if you are struggling, you can always talk to your bank and in a good number of cases they would agree to some form of overdraft that will be safer.

false,unnatural_rights,num23,,"&gt; True, but at the same time, the limited time he is getting, he isn't exactly impressing. He's certainly not impressed me that much with his time this season. 

The issue I have with pointing at this data point as evidence is: how many league minutes has Soldado had this season?  90, 100 total, across all matches?  So he's been in play for the combined sum of a single match, usually brought on as a substitute, playing after an hour of momentum and action has already gone by.

He's a poacher.  You can't just throw him into a match and expect him to pull goals out of his ass like a wizard, he needs dedicated playing time with a solid and stable supporting lineup of attacking midfielders who he can both assist (as he has amply demonstrated an ability to do) and who can assist him, feeding him goals that he will slot in with ease.  Even the goal he created from Townsend required him to stretch wildly and unnecessarily.

Simply put, he's not had proper service at all this season, and he's not been given sufficient minutes to build up match rapport with the rest of our outfield.  Adebayor couldn't hit a barn door right now and I see absolutely no downside to at least *trying* something else; his goalscoring leaves me fundamentally uninspired and I don't think he's as talented as Soldado in support or in actually making an effort.

EDIT: I've checked; he's only played two league matches all season, both as a substitute, for a combined total of less than 45 minutes on the pitch in the league.  10 minutes against QPR and 30 against West Brom.  He's scored two goals in five appearances total, once against Limassol and once against Forest.  Ade, meanwhile, only has one goal (against QPR) in 6 appearances, all of which were in the league, totaling more than *500 combined minutes of play*.

There is a serious imbalance and Soldado *deserves* to be given a chance to prove himself.",0,1412258889,null,0,1412260326,0,ckye1jv,t3_2i030t,t1_ckye1jv,t1_cky9ucd,null,1426720122,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

This being a STEM university, everyone was obviously all for policy based on lots of scientific evidence, but over the course of the year it soon became apparent that it's not that simple for a lot of cases.

Lots of factors come into play, and the mains ones given by the lecturer that needed to be take into account are these:

Experience, expertise and Judgement

Resources

Political Values

Habit and Tradition

Consultants, Lobbyists and Pressure Groups

Pragmatics and Contingencies

(I'm happy to expand on these, just don't exactly want to type the whole lecture out)

All these things will have to change before you can have truly evidence based policy, along with the problem of the precautionary principle which was the main thing that caused the fuck up of the BSE crisis.

Then you have further problems with the way political and scientific time-scales don't match up, as in the evidence might be needed straight away to make an informed decision , but it's just not ready yet, or securing funding for something like a 10-20 year project needs cooperation from all parties.

And then of course the media will leap on any ""flip-flop"" like a ravenous wolf even if it is based on very good evidence.

Politically:

* Immediate abolition of both remaining hereditary peers and the Lords Spiritual.  

* Reform of the Lords so that selected groups (to be reviewed every 5 years by parliament) get to send some experts.  

* Other Lords to be selected by regional bodies on a 15 year rotating term (3rd up for election each time).

* STV/Mixed member elections for the Commons.

* Federalised structure for UK at large. Precise boundaries to be set based upon consultation but they don't have to be even.

Housing:

* Reduce the power people have under the planning system to interfere with new builds. Particularly ""my house price will drop"" is not a reason to deny a new build.

* Institute a policy exchanging unsuitable brown sites in London with green field sites on the perimeter. Brown sites to be cleaned up and turned into parks. New green field plots to have ""use it or lose it"" clauses in the purchase contract. No plot sitting to drive up prices.

* Modify laws to enable new council house builds. In particular set a house building target each year and whenever the market fails to reach it add a proportionally sized subsidy to councils to produce council builds the year after.

Economics:

* Decrease corporation tax. Loop hole bonfire to take place.

* Decrease VAT, increase baseline income tax and the top rate.

* Increase payment thresholds on all brackets of income tax. Institute an inflation escalator so that thresholds increase automatically.

* Increase the death taxes.

* Institute a temporary capital adequacy escalator to ease banks off leveraging.

Welfare:

* Replace unemployment and pension with citizens income.

Looking at the rest of the graphs, it's so much cherry-picking and incomplete data. A graphs on TOTAL points by age, without taking into account number of drivers of that age, etc.

I mean for fucks sake the ""number of points on license"" chart doesn't even have a column or any form of data for people with no points.

Yes in 1974, the first election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour having 4 more seats than the conservatives.  At the time the Liberals only had 14 seats which wouldn't have been enough to form a majority. The Conservatives (who had previously been in government) lost their seats, partly to liberals but mostly because of the rise in local parties in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.  The election later that year ended with a Labour majority.

Turn out for the first election was 78.8%, turn out for the second was 72.8%. Notably the campaign for the second election was less rigorous and Labour only just won the majority. Most of Labour's success was also attributed to them managing to achieve a few small successes whilst running as a minority government in the 6 months between the elections. 

tl;dr In an ideal world, people would be more invigorated to vote in order to prevent damage to the country, but in reality election fatigue sets in.

Bare in mind in 1974, it was incredibly close, with the vote being decided by just a few seats. The gap was much wider in the 2010 general election, and based on what he can observe, there is nothing to suggest the second election wouldn't have also been a hung parliament (indeed this is what happened Greek 2012 general elections, and their stakes were much higher).",0,1412261350,null,0,1412261624,0,ckyf716,t3_2i2vbx,t1_ckyf716,t1_ckyd31o,null,1426719583,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

* Implement an amnesty tax to help bring wealth back into the UK thats been hidden offshore. This would be a one time thing and hopefully see a lot of tax revenue generated.
* Tax 40% for anyone earning more than £15k, moving to 45% at £20k up to 50% at £35 or over. (in order to keep this fair,  they would then remove many other hidden* taxes)
* Increase VAT to 21% for certain categories. 12% VAT for meals in restaurants / entertainment (to encourage people to go out and spend)
* Relax planning laws and encourage new builds. 
* Large duties levied on land suitable for building on.
* Increase interest rates 1% per year for the next 5 years. This is an attempt to have people default on mortgages and start the fixing of the housing bubble. 
* Improve tenant rights (see Europe). Remove Estate agent fees and have all landlords register like Doctors (they can be struck off if they fail to maintain properties). 
* Build cycling infrastructure in all major cities. (look at Holland, ignoring its a little flatter). 
* Youth Pubs. Another European idea but non-profit pubs run and frequented by the youth (normally 18 - 30). These provide a staff place for them to relax in and bring the community together. 
* Nationalise the Rail System and look to invest in R&amp;D for building our own rolling stock again. 
* Scrap university tuition fees (even for those who have already been through uni have 'loans'). 
* State funded day-care (free at the point of service) for 6month to 4years. 
* Reform prisions to avoid punishment and encourage rehabilitation.

No, of course the extra £20 a year won't bankrupt me or any of my colleagues but you have to look at it in the wider context of what's going on in the profession. 

£20 on it's own is not a large amount but NMC fees have increased by 57% over the past two years. One of my colleagues recently told me that when they first qualified the registration fee was a one off payment, now it's yearly and has risen not gradually and in line with inflation but at a dramatic rate because the NMC are incapable of managing their budget. Other cost cutting measures have been suggested and dismissed. For example, many Nurses find it galling that the NMC continue to maintain posh offices in an expensive area of London instead of moving to a more modest premises despite complaining of being in dire financial straits. 

Nurses have seen their pay frozen and we are told it will continue to 2017, while pension contributions have risen and we are told we must work for longer to get less. Pay incremements (which contrary to popular belief are performance related and not just for time served) have also been threatened. Many of us are working more unpaid overtime than ever before because the cuts to health and social care service have a knock on effect on community nursing teams and the wards are increasingly short-staffed.

It's not about the £20, it's about kicking people when they're down. Nurses are already feeling under valued and this doesn't help. I do worry that if things carry on as they are, many will simply refuse to put up with it and emigrate to countries like Canada or Australia where Nurses receive better pay or leave the profession altogether. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not pleading poverty but as a part time Nurse (the registration fee is not pro-rata) who already has to pay £6 per day to park at my own place of work, never takes breaks and brings paperwork home every weekend, I can't say I'm thrilled at having to pay £120 a year for the privilege of doing my job.

The main thing that worries me about Rodgers is that he's being as stubborn with the 4-2-3-1 as Kenny was about playing Hendo in right midfield. Kenny's refusal to adapt his formations or tactics led to his departure and I hope Rodgers doesn't keep trying what we all know doesn't work.",0,1412263457,null,0,false,0,ckyg86v,t3_2i0xqy,t1_ckyg86v,t1_ckyarvt,null,1426719032,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Throughout June and July 1994, it published provocative pictures of McKenzie, touting her 34GG bra size and counting down the days until it could legally show her topless

false,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"UKIP, at it's core, isn't a racial party. They don't care whether you're black or white, British or foreign; they only care if you have money. That's why they focus so much on poor Eastern European immigrants, or money being paid into the EU, rather than rich foreign investors from China, the Middle East and America buying up property and businesses in the UK. Both surely have an effect on the British people, but they only focus on one kind of foreigner, the poor kind. 

This is also why they support things like slashing foreign aid and benefits, why (until a few weeks before the European Election) they supported a flat tax rate, and still support slashing taxes in general, and why many of their members support the right-Libertarian ideals of mass privatisation. They are a party of wealth, not a party of Britishness. 

However, with their immigration policies, many on the outskirts of the party conflate that with being a more racialist party, or being a xenophobic party in general. This is also helped by people like Nigel having a streak of xenophobia to them (Eastern European people trackickers and all that), or at least realising that a large percentage of their vote is from more xenophobic groups. This attracts the more racist/xenophobic crowd, who don't want border controls to stop poor people getting in, rather want border controls to stop as many foreigners as possible getting in.

 [**SIDRAT**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/SIDRAT): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;A __SIDRAT__ (pronouced ""sigh-drat"") was a type of space-time vessel used by the War Lords and built with the assistance of the War Chief, a renegade Time Lord.
&gt;While similar to TARDISes, SIDRATs were somewhat less developed space-time travelling machines. The Second Doctor found it wasn't difficult for him to understand the operation of the machines. Like TARDISes, SIDRATs were larger on the inside than the outside, but unlike TARDISes, the dimensions of their interiors could be changed at will. According to Jamie McCrimmon, they were green in colour.
&gt;The Time Lords discounted SIDRATs as viable space-time transports due to their short range and power costs. From the outside they resembled featureless rectangle boxes, similar in appearance to a form sometimes used by TARDISes while on Gallifrey (possibly a ""default"" exterior for TARDISes). The War Lords employed them both to abduct human soldiers for the war games, and also to travel back and forth from the game area to their base. (TV: *The War Games*) They were operated by remote control.

 [**SIDRAT**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/SIDRAT): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;A __SIDRAT__ (pronouced ""sigh-drat"") was a type of space-time vessel used by the War Lords and built with the assistance of the War Chief, a renegade Time Lord.
&gt;While similar to TARDISes, SIDRATs were somewhat less developed space-time travelling machines. The Second Doctor found it wasn't difficult for him to understand the operation of the machines. Like TARDISes, SIDRATs were larger on the inside than the outside, but unlike TARDISes, the dimensions of their interiors could be changed at will. According to Jamie McCrimmon, they were green in colour.
&gt;The Time Lords discounted SIDRATs as viable space-time transports due to their short range and power costs. From the outside they resembled featureless rectangle boxes, similar in appearance to a form sometimes used by TARDISes while on Gallifrey (possibly a ""default"" exterior for TARDISes). The War Lords employed them both to abduct human soldiers for the war games, and also to travel back and forth from the game area to their base. (TV: *The War Games*) They were operated by remote control.

Scotland was lead to a referendum by a bunch of short sighted, power hungry, nationalists. Sure that sounds pretty bad, however...

Those devolutions will hopefully not just be for Scotland but for Wales, Northern Ireland and England too.

Even if it was done for ""simple populist"" reasons. The Scottish Referendum was one of the most amazing things to happen in British politics for a century. And it showed that we are still an island of self-determination.

I think UKIP forcing a referendum about the EU will do the same for the whole of Britain. We will get to vote and whatever we will decide it will be the majority.

Also, there is this:

In general I've only read the good stuff about saving; it increases R&amp;D, company creation and retraining levels. And of course means we are all a reduced burden on the state when we retire. I don't doubt government policy can be used to reduce the value of that savings, but the BoE have a legal requirement to keep inflation in a 2% range, I would hope that the level of saving wouldn't effect that rule.

In the simplified and likely wrong world I understand, saving should lower our trade deficit (because we are consuming less) and so would help to lower the inflation rate, but I would like to see a real economist agree with that statement before I repeat it often.

I dunno; with a suitable balance of power between the sectarian parties, you can have a smaller Alliance grouping leveraging it towards getting their policies through the middle; look how it was Alliance flag policy (as distinct from that of the unionists or the shinners) which caused the whole flegger brouhaha of a year or two back in Belfast.

Sure that initially involves wangling some sort of compromise with one or other sectarian party, but if they play it smart enough, they could use their prior record to gain more electoral support, in a Scottish National Party stylee (or alternately throw it all away, in true Liberal Democrat fashion!).

false,isometimesweartweed,null,null,"1. GMs are not 'natural'. Neither is wheat from the first crossing of wild grasses and wheat tens of thousands of years ago. Neither is plant breeding through selection, the basis of agriculture and the foundation of all civilisation. The system we have now is where we take genetic material from one wheat variety that we like (high yield) and we cross breed it with another wheat variety that has a different trait that we like (drought tolerance) and we cross breed them, and cross breed them, and again, and again and again. Till we end up with a wheat variety that has both traits. This takes upwards of 10 years. GM is essentially taking the genetic material you want from a plant, and putting it in in a lab through biolistics or something. This process saves huge amounts of time, and money. It's essentially the exact same process, but GM is directed, and is accurate (you choose the genetic material you use) whereas plant crossing is entirely random (you cross the plants and hope you get the traits you want-leading to a situation where you have to breed plants literally millions of times over). If GM gets out? GM is grown in open air environments all the time? Sure if you wanted to grow a plant that is incredibly hard to get rid of like japanese knotweed, then sure you could design it, why though? Do you know of a specific GM plant that has been given the genetic material to spread fast and act like a weed?

2. Allergic reactions? Well they are tested when they are made for potential allergens, and so far there doesn't seem to be evidence of building allergic reactions, and if anything GMOs can be designed to remove common allergens from [food](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/386/1317.full). Long term effects? True, but it won't be much different from crossed foods, because again it is just the same process but instead of inserting genetic material with pollen, we do it in a lab. But there has been a recent study across 1 billion animals fed GMO that has concluded that GMO fed animals had no difference in health due to GMO consumption. In fact there is no evidence to suggest GMO food is 'bad' for you. 

3. Insects develop resistance to ALL plants, not just GMOs, this is an argument for GMO use as you can quickly design a new crop, whereas with crossing it can take 10 years (if it's even successful)

4. The global population is expanding, climate is changing at an incredible rate compared to the past, fossil fuels and cheap energy is slowly dwindling, and the rate of increase in yields through traditional crossing is slowing down to almost a complete stop. We need to grow more food, with less resources than ever before in human history, as well as that food production needs to become more localised due to rising fossil fuel costs that will make exporting and importing food far more expensive, we also need to be able to design crops that are suitable for the climate it was meant for, with crossing it may take years to develop a crop, in that time climate conditions may have changed, and it may no longer be suitable, GM can adapt far more quickly in comparison. It is not simply a matter of logistics. And honestly it is incredibly dangerous to think like that.

Every single plant scientist/scientist/food security expert etc I have spoken to has said that GMOs will have to become part of the global food supply. Traditional plant breeding is not efficient not successful enough to be used to support so many people, with so few resources.

True, but this is a problem of education, not the name itself. The point I was making is that a pat on the bum *can*, depending on context, be enormously harmful, even if we all agree that it's a far less serious crime than attempted rape. It can cause a lot of the same kind of harm as attempted rape, such as trust issues, problems with sexuality etc, so it's right that it's classed in the same way, even if it's less serious. I guess what I'm saying is that ""sexual assault"" is (IMO) an objectively correct name for such a crime, even if, through failure of education, people have learnt to associate that name with much more serious things than patting someone on the arse.

There is an obvious disparity between the likes of Savile and less serious criminals, but what a lot of these crimes had in common was the context in which they took place (like the fucking beeb), the culture of silence, the reports that were ignored, the fear of challenging such respected individuals etc. Hence there is definitely a lot to be gained by discussing them collectively, even if that makes some of them sound a bit worse than they were.",0,1412267448,null,0,false,0,ckyic9z,t3_2i2nwh,t1_ckyic9z,t1_ckyhfmd,null,1426718045,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

- Repeal Labour’s 1998 Human Rights Act.

- Break the formal link between British courts and the European Court of Human Rights. In future Britain’s courts will no longer be required to take into account rulings from the Court in Strasbourg. This will make our Supreme Court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK.

- End the ability of the European Court to require the UK to change British laws. Every judgement against the UK will be treated as advisory and will have to be approved by Parliament if it is to lead to a change in our laws.

- Define much more clearly when and how Human Rights laws in the UK are to be applied. This will end the ability of the Courts to decide unilaterally to apply Human Rights laws to whole new areas of public life.

- Limit the use of Human Rights laws to the most serious cases. They will no longer apply in trivial cases.

- Balance rights and responsibilities. People who do not fulfil their responsibilities in society should not be able to claim so-called “qualified rights” in their defence in a court of law.

- Ensure that those who pose a national security risk to this country or have entered it illegally cannot rely on questionable human rights claims to prevent their deportation.

&gt; 
&gt; There was however a legitimate debate to be had about the use of mass surveillance programmes, he added.

1. There's no doubt terrorist organisations scoured those documents for ways to harm the US and UK governments. I'm not aware that anyone is questioning that. It's certainly damaged international relations with friendly powers which inherently weakens the US and UK internationally. 

2. Compare that the Conservative's/Home Secretary's response:

    &gt;We don't comment on intelligence matters. 

3. Compare that to the Labour party who were the people set the whole damn system up in the first place after 9/11. It's not like you'll be getting a stronger response from anyone else. Everyone else is both complicit and enthusiastically in support. No debate needed according to the government and the Labour party. The Home Secretary is on stage lamenting the fact that she can't spy on British citizens and being clapped for it and I haven't heard a peep from Miliband. I expect many of the politicos that helped set up the GCHQ internet surveillance system are still working in the Labour party so we can almost expect worse things from them.

It could possibly have limped along for the 5 years until the next election, but we'd inevitably then have a Conservative landslide.

That's an extraordinary leap of thought which is just a guess if you are honest.   You only get one vote per MP so the disproportionate amount of power to other parties is less than you make out.

Anyways - I don't think anyone disagrees that the LibDems have shot themselves in the foot and was a mistake.

4. 10 billion is a huge jump from what we have now, and you're missing my point, crops we have designed through cross breeding are not suitable for the future, we have basically reached the end in terms of growth of yield through traditional methods and distributing food to those who need it is only going to get harder from here on in. We need to adapt quickly to changing conditions with GM. For example, most (if not all) plants bred today are designed to be grown in 'optimal' conditions. It would not be too far stretched to think that optimal conditions will become rarer, we need to grow a whole spectra of more hardy crops, that can still deliver on yield despite growing in sub par conditions. True things like eating insects, reducing meat consumption will all help. However GM is a tool that can help us so absolutely hugely it would be insane not to use it. We're not just talking about increased yields, increased nutrient content could lead to undernourished populations getting key nutrients they need (golden rice for example-Greenpeaces campaigning against it has killed literally millions of children and that is despicable) we can design plants to produce chemicals, medicines, and other compounds.

1. Does Alex Pritchard have a Premier League career ahead of him? Or will he top out at a lower level?

2. Just how much do you love Harry Kane?

3. What do you think of the suitability of our players' loan destinations? In particular, is Swansea a good spot for Tom Carroll? He's only gotten a few matches in with them, and I worry that he may stagnate there. 

4. Similarly, did you expect Eric Dier to go out on loan when he first arrived? I worry about his playing time over the course of the season, and wonder if he might have been better served at a Championship or lower Premiership side where he'd be a first choice central defender.

Civil liberties were also codified by Hong Kong's citizens during that period and protections for these civil and democratic rights put in place in agreement between Britian, Hong Kong's citizens and China. China wouldn't never have pushed for democracy; that was the Hong Kong citizen's push with British support that achieved that; and China agreed to it to preserve the economic stability in Hong Kong. The democratic reforms have stalled since China took over in 1997.

Realistically Britain couldn't have done much more - China could easily have taken Hong Kong any moment they wanted. Even if they only took back the New Territories after the 99 year lease ran out, the rest of Hong Kong would have suffered economically. Britain was in a very weak negotiating position, but fortunately China wanted Hong Kong intact and was pragmatic. The fact that Britain and Hong Kong got China to agree to allow so much Democracy and independence and preserve it after the handover (even if only for 50 years) was actually quite an achievement.

Now nearly 17 years on the world has changed. China is nearing super power status, and Britain is a minnow. There is little Britain can do for the people of Hong Kong now, and as such a small nation if we antagonise China they can push us around with no downside for them (e.g. restrict access to their markets to punish as, as they have actually already done before). We would get a lot of economic pain for a symbolic gesture which actually would have no practical effect. Sadly Hong Kong is part of China, and this whole situation is completely out of our hands.",0,1412269625,null,0,false,0,ckyji3r,t3_2hxr17,t1_ckyji3r,t1_ckx9jln,null,1426717505,2,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,2

1. He could do. I was surprising a few people last season and over the summer by saying that I thought he might join a Championship side permanently. And, honestly, I still think there's a chance he might sign on for good with Brentford - after all, Warburton's watched him over a few seasons. I think his issue is going to be putting together consistent performances, and that's totally understandable for a player of his type. He has a lot of talent but I personally think he doesn't *quite* have enough pace, enough strength or enough versatility (think you need probably need one or more of these) to make it as a PL player (certainly not at the top level).

And the original Master arc with Roger Delgado's incarnation was supposed to end with him sacrificing his life to save the Doctor (with the Master being revealed to be either a Valeyard type character or the Doctor's brother). Unfortunately Roger Delgado died in a sudden accident on the set of another film so the arc was left uncompleted. So the Master becoming more sane and giving his life to save the Doctor is partially closing up an arc that was started just under 40 years prior to The End of Time.

I think that they could easily make the Master still be an antagonist but more sane and less evil. An antagonist does not have to be out and out evil to have ideological differences that lead to conflict (something akin to early Magneto and Xavier in X-Men). They could also have the Master attempt to go straight but either cannot fight his own darker nature or other people's actions/prejudices won't let him stay straight (kind of like Harvey Dent in Batman).

I think it would actually be really interesting to explore a non-evil Master for a while. Maybe the Doctor and the Master travel around a bit, but they do not agree with how the other handles situations.

Plus, confidence is key for a good defender, because one has to be both patient and aggressive, picking the right time to close on an attacker; when a guy lacks confidence, you can see it in the hesitations and false starts. Given Dier's situation, I think he needs to play 90 minutes a week against opposition that's both competitive but also within his capabilities.

It's not unskilled labour we have a shortage of in the UK, and if immigration numbers remained the same but every unskilled migrant entering the country were replaced by one with transferable skills that we have shortages of I don't think anyone would complain.

They have a totally hardline stance on immigration though, and want something similar to Australia's policy, which IMO is far to restrictive and way over the top.

Somewhere in-between would be a reasonable compromise.

I do totally disagree with their whole stance of leaving the EU though (and many of their other policies). So wouldn't be voting for them on that basis alone.

I think for a lot of people considering switching to voting UKIP it depends a lot on whether their local candidate isn't a total dickhead. A few of their current party members would probably be better off standing for the [MRLP](http://www.omrlp.com/) they seem so unhinged from reality.

He wants the ball, he wants to pass out, and he wants to push forward and get involved.

Chiriches has played DM before and - this might be a bit left-field - but I think it'd be a really smart idea to give him a couple of matches in DM in 'lesser' matches to help him re-find his confidence.

Oh, like how as an immigrant they want me to pay £200 a year (to start with and then increasing) to use the NHS, *even though I was paying national insurance* and all the same taxes as everyone else and the NHS is being privatised, having it's funding cut, and standards of care and waiting times are getting worse. Nobody comes from another country with a functioning public healthcare system to use the NHS, only people from the US and developing countries would and for both those groups it is hard to get visas. You have to have been in the country for 3-6 months and working, the family of someone working, or a student, to even get an NHS number. GP surgeries can ask you to show payslips. And unless it's an emergency you can't get anywhere without going through a GP first, you can't just turn up at the A&amp;E of a random hospital and go ""hello, yes, I'm foreign, please give me a bed for months and fix all my long term chronic health issues"" That doesn't happen.

I had to leave the country over the standard of NHS services in Essex at the moment, and they think ""health tourism"" is a thing, I've seen a report saying more people leave the UK to get healthcare (mostly elective, to be fair) than come to the UK to use the NHS.

It was interesting to hear Rodgers’ appeal to the collective after the defeat at St Jakob Park. “It is vitally important we get back to playing as a team,” he said. “That was the huge advantage we had over the last 18 months and it is important we work together as a team.” That line came in a lament over Liverpool’s technical work this season, specifically the lack of it, but followed a night when Balotelli ignored the manager’s request to go to the travelling supporters after the final whistle, Coutinho angrily exchanged words with Rodgers during the game and blanked his manager when substituted, and Gerrard was involved in another dispute with Mignolet after a mistake on the edge of the area.

I cannot fathom this comment at all. Even if we ignore the fact that price increases are probably a supply demand issue, how does banks competing for mortgages from customers increase prices? Surely the person picking the mortgage would go for the cheapest buy to let mortgage offered from competing brokers? I would love to see their theoretical reasoning for why monopolistic situations are preferable to a perfectly competitive market.

2. No they're not always right, but when the entire scientific community is in almost complete unanimous agreement after decades of study, I think it's probably best to go with that isn't it.

Yes, you're misunderstanding. The applies in the wild are the result of thousands of years of selective breeding. Take a look at wild Iranian apples for an example of previous iterations of apples. They were much smaller, sourer, poorer texture, seedy. Vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collard greens, kale are all the result of human artificial selection of the mustard plant, they did not arise naturally. Modern GMO is exactly the same principle on a finer level. See http://www.colby.edu/biology/bi164/Lab/Lab%201ArtSel,Pt1-08.pdf

Almost any fruit or vegetable you buy from a supermarket, organic or not, or forage in the wild has been influenced by human intentful genetic modification. If you want to eat 'natural' fruit by your definition, you'd be having a very bad time I assure you. GMO food isn't about feeding starving Africans, it's applying our most up to date practices to grow better crops, as we have done since time immemorial.

For a lot of that game, the players looked like they didn't have any clue what they were supposed to be doing in attack, although that's probably a side effect of having such a patchwork side out there. The passing was ponderous and the movement off the ball was predictable. I wish we had another forward for the rotation, because I don't really see the merit in starting Eto'o, but there's no other option for when Lukaku needs half a game off. He got into the right place at the right time to score, but he could be doing that coming off the bench for the last 25 minutes.

You should also look into other Russell Group universities. Some include Oxford, Cambridge, University of Durham, University of Manchester, University of Birmingham, etc. (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group)

I know several people studying at the University of Liverpool, which is located in a cheaper city and has a nice campus and very nice facilities.
