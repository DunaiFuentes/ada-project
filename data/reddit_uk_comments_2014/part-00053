&gt;**The Illusionist** ([French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): **L'Illusionniste**) is a 2010 British-French [animated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation) [comedy-drama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy-drama) film directed by [Sylvain Chomet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvain_Chomet). The film is based on an unproduced script written by French [mime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime), director and actor [Jacques Tati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Tati) in 1956. Controversy surrounds Tati's motivation for the script, which was written as a personal letter to his estranged eldest daughter, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel  in collaboration with his long-term writing partner [Henri Marquet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Marquet), between writing for the films Mon Oncle and Play Time.

true,IAmElizabethGould,,Pub band bassist- requests anyone?♫,"With M:tG, you've got what's known as a deck. This is a set of cards (minimum is 60, no upper limits). The cards are divided between 'lands', 'creatures' and 'spells', and you're required to have a range of cards of all three types in order to be able to play. There are also different coloured spell cards, each of which has their own qualities and specific powers. Part of the skill needed to create a good deck means evaluating combinations of cards and the strengths and weaknesses they have, especially in combination with other cards. 

   As to how it's played, Wikipedia does a better job than I can of explaining this:

&gt;In a game of Magic, two or more players are engaged in a battle as powerful wizards called ""planeswalkers"". A player starts the game with twenty ""life points"" and loses when he or she is reduced to zero. Players lose life when they are dealt ""damage"" by being attacked with summoned creatures or when spells or other cards cause them to lose life directly. A player can also lose if he or she must draw from an empty deck (called the ""library"" during the game), or if they have acquired 10 ""poison counters"". In addition, some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game.
Some cards have effects that override normal game rules. Garfield has stated that two major influences in his creation of Magic: the Gathering were the games Cosmic Encounter,[34] which first used the concept that normal rules could sometimes be overridden, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The ""Golden Rules of Magic"" state that ""Whenever a card's text directly contradicts the rules, the card takes precedence.""[35] This allows Wizards of the Coast great flexibility in creating cards, but can cause problems when attempting to reconcile a card with the rules (or two cards with each other). The Comprehensive Rules, a detailed rulebook, exists to clarify these conflicts.
Players begin the game by shuffling their decks and then drawing seven cards.[37] Players draw one card at the beginning of each of their turns, except the first player on their first turn. Players alternate turns consisting of several phases. Most cards can only be played during the main phase of the player's own turn. The player whose turn it is always has the first chance to play cards. At the end of a player's turn, if that player has more than seven cards in hand, the player discards until their hand contains seven cards. The contents of other players' decks and hands are not usually known to players.
The two basic kinds of cards in Magic are ""spells"" and ""lands"". Lands provide ""mana"", or magical energy, which is used as magical fuel when the player attempts to cast spells. Players may only play one land per turn. More powerful spells cost more mana, so as the game progresses more mana becomes available, and the quantity and relative power of the spells played tends to increase. Some spells also require the payment of additional resources, such as cards in play or life points. Spells come in several varieties: ""sorceries"" and ""instants"" have a single, one-time effect before they go to the ""graveyard"" (discard pile); ""enchantments"" and ""artifacts"" are ""permanents"" that remain in play after being cast to provide a lasting magical effect; ""creature"" spells (also a type of permanent) summon creatures that can attack and damage an opponent. The set Lorwyn introduced the new ""planeswalker"" card type, which represent powerful allies who fight with their own magic abilities depending on their loyalty to the player who summoned them. Spells can be of more than one type.",0,1393110000,null,0,false,0,cfm4alb,t3_1ynj9p,t1_cfm4alb,t1_cfm3vvp,null,1432514860,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

To be honest I usually go to bike shops just to try the gear on - then buy it cheaper online ;)

The ones in bold are those that I'd definitely recommend. The others I either haven't been to - or wasn't impressed.

Bike gear isn't cheap but buy good quality and you'll buy once. You only get one body. I'd recommend the following brands:

- Shoei
- Arai
- HJC
- Icon
- RST
- Knox
- AlpineStars
- Sidi
- Arlen Ness

They're the types of kit you see on the race bikes who are clocking over 200mph and walk away from accidents. It isn't all about sponsorship - very often you really do get what you pay for. If you come across some cheap helmets that look good - ask yourself if you'd value your head at £50 or £200. Same goes for hands, feet and back IMO.

&gt;

&gt;For advice / advise and device / devise, American English and British English both keep the noun/verb distinction (where the pronunciation is -[s] for the noun and -[z] for the verb). For licence / license or practice / practise, British English also keeps the noun/verb distinction (the two words in each pair are [homophones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone) with -[s] pronunciation, though). On the other hand, American English uses license and practice for both nouns and verbs (with -[s] pronunciation in both cases too).

&gt;American English has kept the Anglo-French spelling for defense and offense, which are usually defence and offence in British English. Likewise, there are the American pretense and British pretence; but derivatives such as defensive, offensive, and pretension are always thus spelled in both systems.

&gt;Australian  and Canadian usage generally follows British.

If counter attacking is not working or if Hazard is getting closed down, Chelsea are in trouble. Too often I see Hazard and Willian working together, I mean they are suppose to be on the opposite sides, right? Well, why not just bring them closer?

What I have been wishing and hoping for is Hazard to be moved in a more CF role. This gives him the option of going either side without shifting everyone else. With the acquisition of Matic, Chelsea has been able to retain the ball more efficiently. Willian and Ramires are just machines, add in Schurrle or Salah wide (opposite Willian), Chelsea is still solid defensively. 

Chelsea needs a playmaker, badly. As a huge proponent for Oscar during the summer, I feel he has been less than adequate in that department.

I think you stating that 95% of people are just not motivated enough is a bit much, I'd suggest that the job is just not right for everyone if only 5% of applicants, after being filtered thru interviews, can handle it.

I see that it's a sales job, and it's pretty stressful, and again, there's people who excel at that, and I'd suggest you're one of them, and there's people who just can't do it.  That's no reason to label them as lazy or weak, because they're not sales types, other people aren't brain surgeons and it doesn't make them idiots.

I'm also not suggesting there's zero work for anyone.

His second red card was for defending his keeper Matt Gilks after DJ Campbell came in with a very bad tackle on him, DJ Campbell spat at someone if I recall correctly, and then he push/punched Robinson in the face, and Jack retaliated. Of course he absolutely **shouldn't** have retaliated, but it's understandable, and I feel the problem would be worse if he was the aggressor, and that that sort of temper will come out of him very soon, people forget his only 19.

The red card tonight was for a professional foul, he brought Jordan down when he was last man, it's a ""Take one for the team"" moment, which every defender has had to do at least a few times in their career.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think Hazard is the only truly viable choice for a false 9. It really requires a player who is penetrative on the dribble, but who can also playmake from the center when need be.

When your 9 drops into the hole to become a false 9, you create a defensive problem for the other team, because that player can now receive the ball in space. This is a nightmare situation for the defense, because that player can run at the center halves (and score if he gets by them) or play through balls to the wide players breaking in (in between the lines is the best place to play those balls from). This basically forces the other team to move a player between the lines to defend the false 9. So who do you move in there?

* If you move a center half then one of the wide players can slide inside, and now you have a 2v2 (for example RW in the middle + LW against CB + RB). This just isn't a legitimate option because you will get fucked trying to play 2v2 against quality opposition.

* The next option is to drop a holding midfielder back between  the lines. What does this do? Well it removes a guy from midfield. Now the false 9 can just drift around and if the holding player follows him, there will be massive holes in the midfield. This is typically the option that teams employ, but as you can see its hardly a good choice.

What usually ends up happening is that the team compresses vertically to limit space between the lines, dropping into a low pressure system. What this does it make it really hard to win the ball effectively, and even harder to retain it once you've won it. Because of this, the team with the false 9 often has a huge possession advantage.

---

Okay so back to who can play false 9 for us. The dream false 9 can slip quality through balls, and can terrorize the defense on the dribble. On that criteria, Hazard is the clear cut first choice. I would actually argue that of all players in the world, he is second best suited to the role behind Messi. Next choice for me would be Oscar. He would play it more like Fabregas does, with more of an emphasis on playing through balls, but still with enough pace and skill to threaten the back four with the ball at his feet. Third choice would probably be Willian, who would be the other extreme, opting to penetrate on the dribble most of the time.

Sorry this turned into a bit of a tome, I really like the false 9 system haha.",0,1393115012,null,0,false,0,cfm65ye,t3_1ynasl,t1_cfm65ye,t1_cfm16or,null,1432515806,16,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,16

&gt; How about morality.

Whatever one's misgivings about capitalism, adoption of it has increased the world's wealth (wealth meaning in this case the supply of goods and services) considerably. The most recent example of this has been the Chinese rise out of poverty after adopting it, but another important example would be India. I'd say it was pretty moral to support a system that has improved the quality of life for so many.

&gt; A cashless society in which everyone is equal.

Cash is simply a means of barter. What you are talking about is the destruction of property rights. Societies which have tried this (to various extents) include the USSR, China and India. On smaller scales the Israeli kibbutz tried it, before dissolving. The great failings of these systems are all due to poor incentivisation. Perhaps you are one of these types who advocates some sort of ""consciousness change"", but I don't see it happening: humans can't evolve fast enough to meet the ambitions of the far left.

Firstly they have their version of the long term history, making it seem like the Spanish were first to discover the islands etc. to support their alleged historical claim. As if history from that long ago even matters (how about giving back the entirety of Argentina to the natives eh?). 

Then they've got themselves very righteously bombing a British carrier chased by the evil cackling RAF fighters for no apparent reason.

Then they've got this bratty white kid representing the people of the Falklands crying for their big bad bully soldiers to come help them murder a cute Argentinian kid, completely glossing over the fact that Argentina attacked first without provocation and making it seem like the British are the ones causing hostilities. 

Then the best part. The writers have to justify and support the war as a valiant, righteous war whilst simultaneously demonising the previous regime which is obviously hated by the Argentinian people and current government. So they make a distinction between the poor but righteous soldiers who fought the war and the evil general who not only forced them into war but was the cause of them losing it.

So now they have the cartoonish battle with the bad guy brits cackling with laughter during battle and using sneaky things like ""night vision"" (oh how *unfair*!) and big ugly gurkas (this bit is down right fucking racist). And the general is ruining everything by providing them with ""bad equipment"" and delaying their response.

The Argentinian soldiers are all brave and set with grim but righteous determination and each die a hero's death worthy of a spartan in a halo game all while those damn brits are cackling in the background.

~~Queue~~ Cue the song about being peaceful and ""everyone let's be friends, BUT THE MALVINAS ARE STILL FUCKING OURS!""

* IRL, this episode was written before the notion of a War Doctor was created. Moffat wrote this episode with the idea that the Doctor was going to have one more regeneration after Matt Smith.

* In the universe, the Doctor needed to die at Lake Silencio. The Silence knew about the Time Lord's ability to regenerate. The Silence would not know if this was the last time. They needed a full show to be convinced.

* Who was on the Beach instead of the Doctor? The Teselecta, a race of Time Traveling Miniatured Humans who go after criminals from different time periods to punish them, lent the Doctor one of their ships. He was inside the suit.

* How can the Teselecta fake that kind of energy? The first time we saw them, they faked a motorbike. Why would faking time energy be any more impossible?

* Why did the Teselecta know to do that? They were in the room with Melody Pond when she transformed into River Song. They assumed this was part of the process. Also, the Doctor was inside the suit directing.

* How would the know how to copy it exactly? They have on staff a woman that prides herself on getting things perfect. She would want it done perfectly.

* Why did the Teselecta allow one of their suits to be used for this ruse? Having the Doctor owe them a favor is probably more valuable than a suit.",0,1393116571,null,0,1393118341,0,cfm6r5f,t3_1ynx7k,t1_cfm6r5f,t3_1ynx7k,null,1432516083,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

I'm unaware of the sanctions the EU would impose if we didn't comply with them, though clearly this would be politically difficult. 

Whether or not you are in favour of the EU or the ECHR doesn't undermine the basic point that various British governments have signed treaties that legally beholden us to these bodies. Of course since WW2 many governments have signed many things enshrining many principles that they've latterly reneged on, but I think you'd find most of those agreements less legally binding than the EU and ECHR treaties. 

In the end this comes down to a question: Do you believe Westminster and the British Supreme Court should have legal supremacy within the United Kingdom?

This was a cartoon created by the National Education Ministry.

Our current government is addicted to this kind of over-simplistic propaganda. They've been retelling the history from their perspective since they got on board. 

The Falkland/Malvinas issue here is reduced to a slogan (""las Malvinas son Argentinas!""). There is absolutely no room to have a serious discussion on sovereignty in our schools, and I'd say generally in society. The only consensus here is ""war was wrong, Galtieri was a brutal dictator who sent a bunch of kids to certain death"". But that's about it. It's taboo to say that the Falklands are actually British or that the Kelpers do have a say on their own land.

On a different note, that song from the ending was hilarious. Needless to say, the subtitles are embellished and those aren't the actual lyrics.

true,thefamilyatomics,lfc99,,"I disagree with the caveat that it would require wise reinvestment in the transfer market. Basically without Suarez you lose 30ish goals and 15 assists (based on this season). That is a lot. You also lose the intangibles, which in some sense is a bigger loss (and basically irreplaceable). But I think that we could sell Suarez and still add to the trophy chest next year.

First, Sturridge has the potential to be the best striker in the world (the only thing holding him back is decision making, really). He's not even in his prime. Just think about that. 

But right now we score basically no goals from midfield (not counting Gerrard's PKs) and very few from the wings. Reinvesting the money can make up for the measurable loss of Suarez's goal contribution and (perhaps just as importantly) replace or rotate some under-performing starters (I'm looking at you, first-choice fullbacks). And (as distasteful as I find the idea) we can spend some real money getting a real replacement for Gerrard who is in or entering his prime (someone like a Vidal). 

Yes, yes a complete squad replacement negatively affected Spurs (at least, initially). But we don't need that kind of overhaul. One striker (remember Borini is coming back too), one versatile mid with a goal threat, at least one full back, maybe a wide forward/winger. Plus Suso is coming back, Teixera is going to be a player, Ibe is an even surer prospect and Jordan Rossiter is a 5 star scouse hero in FM.

Of course, I'd prefer to have Suarez retire a red (we certainly deserve that based on the support he's received after literally biting an opponent). But it wouldn't be the end of the world and more importantly, it doesn't have to halt the club's momentum.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"When this argument is run it's usually on the basis that the state spends about £11,000 per UK citizen.  This means that on this basis you need to be paying tax on an income of around £30,000 to be a net taxpayer.

However, this is an extremely rudimentary and inelegant model.  *(Not that that means the government won't peddle it.)*

The most obvious flaw is that to say, *""1/65,000,000"" of the total expenditure on x was spent on your behalf!""* doesn't work.  To poke at one of the more ludicrous angles it means that the state would claim on this basis to have spent more money than many people contributed on wars that those people opposed.

The issue that's directly relevant to this is that the benefit to corporations isn't a feature.  The list of ways this is fundamentally flawed is nearly endless.  A few examples to get you going though:

1.  When a company pays wages that are insufficient to lift that employee out of the benefits system the state is subsidising the wage it pays.  But that subsidy is charged to you and me as taxpayers, not to the company.  *(With almost all these things there's probably an argument in that the subsidy comes out the other end in the form of dividends to the shareholders.)*

2.  There's a decent case to argue that although I have no kids I benefit from a state education system.  However, it's plain that I don't get the same amount of benefit of someone who does have kids.  In turn, corporations get the benefit of employees who have been educated without attribution of the cost.  The same argument runs for something like the NHS, where corporations get the benefit of healthier employees.

3.  Corporations benefit from and are dependent on infrastructure such as road and rails.  *(They actually have a primary and secondary dependence.  If you take as an example a supermarket they have a dependence insofar as that they couldn't readily get goods to central distribution, or from there to the stores.  They also have a dependency in that the same infrastructure allows you to easily travel further, so you can actually shop there.)*  Again, this model simply charges the whole of the cost to individuals.",0,1393127928,null,0,false,0,cfmavfo,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cfmavfo,t1_cflr0ac,null,1432518024,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They closed the local over 60s mental health ward and put them into the normal ward, so you now have an age range of 16-80+ all together, this put even more of a strain on the staff and the ward itself, as for a ward of 13 beds + 5 or 6 daycare patients, there's 5 nurses now since the cutbacks, and the oaps can easily take up 2 or 3 of the nurses due to their extra needs.

Ontop of that they are aiming to close the next nearest ward that's a similar size to save 220k per year, and aiming to treat these patients at home rather than have them in a hospital.

This will lead to more and more people who will be forced into my position.

Cameron's inoffensive electability can likely be demonstrated by the fact that he *was* elected, then all the MPs that never wanted him in the first place started determinedly trying to make the party implode, just like in the Major years.

It is usually proposed that the level of income under a UBI scheme would be about equivalent to the dole + all the other benefits one would get. That is, it is enough to live on if you like living in a small flat, eating reconstituted chicken, and buying clothes at Asda. Since most people want to live in a spacious house, eat real food, and wear nice clothes, they'll work.

&gt;Also to suggest that you could pay for a guaranteed basic income by ""other welfare cuts"" makes me wonder if you're taking the piss in some way.

Because the UBI is enough to live on, you can scrap virtually every other form of welfare (I'd keep the carers benefits  because a carer is effectively a poorly paid government employee with unlimited working hours, alternatively). Moreover, you can scrap all the means testing and other bureaucracy that goes with it, all the people who write, translate, distribute, and explain the information brochures, database admins, clerks, and so on.

The only administration needed is determining which bank accounts belong to whom (so each person only gets paid once), but the taxmen already do that, and depending on the version of the scheme, working out where people live. (Either you pay everyone based on local cost of living, or you pay everyone London rates and watch the cost of living level out very quickly.)

So as discussed in another reply to your post you are talking about fractional reserve banking. The problem with your argument is that there are controls on how much credit banks can generate as central banks will make them hold a certain amount in reserve and have big enough capital ratios.

The total amount of money paid to banks was £124bn, every year the financial sector pays ~£53.4bn (figure for 2010, its higher now) in tax, this was 11.2% of all tax revenue received by the government. In addition that government money was not a free handout, it went into buying shares in the failing banks and will most probably be repaid with interest.

This was done because allowing those banks to fail would have caused far more damage to the economy and ordinary people than this bail out did. In a perfect theoretical world they would have been allowed to go under, but providing a point at the expense of the entire country is thankfully not what the government decided to do.

I don't think it's anything quite as sinister as that.

There's also an element of knowing that the country is basically (partially) fucked at this point and they're like Wile E. Coyote, they've run full speed off the cliff, supported by air. If they stop and look down, they'll realise what a fucking mess they're creating.

The policy when I was there was borderline aggressive up-selling on just about everything. Someone's buying a game? Try to sell them a controller or some other add ons. Someone's buying a console? Try to sell them as many games and accessories as you can. I hated it, I'm a gamer and aside from the occasional person who came in to grab what they wanted and maybe have a chat about the game they are getting, 90% of my day was taken up with trying to sell 20 iterations of Mario to a middle aged woman who had no idea what she was buying or a lovely old couple who wanted to buy a present for their grandson. GAME requires you to hit sales targets every, single, day no matter how much you resent it or hate repeating the same bloody questions over and over again. And you had better hit those targets too, a few weeks of lacklustre performance will see you either warned formally or shown the door.

If you're just doing it over Christmas for a few extra quid, then you can get through it easily, but if you're planning on staying there for any amount of time longer than 3 months then you should prepare to have any love for games crushed and any affinity for brick and mortar stores destroyed.

This is simply not true, and ignores the fact that the we've always bought equipment from abroad *and also* from the UK.

There's also growing pressure from workers in China in particular that poses the reverse of your question. Why shouldn't they get more pay to bring them up to parity with wages for similar skills in the West. Prices from China are rising year on year.

First of all, congratulations for having the strength to leave your family. However, there shouldn't be any need for a begging bowl, as we have both a welfare state and a charitable sector, and you show no signs of having exhausted any entitlements to benefits or explored the charitable sector.

There's a benefits calculator here to work out what you might be entitled to http://www.turn2us.org.uk/benefits_search.aspx

There are a variety of charities listed here - they're focussed on forced marriage, but (a) a lot of them work with people from Muslim backgrounds with your sort of circumstances too (b) your background suggests that you may be at risk of forced marriage, so you may like to avail yourself of their help too http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2583453

As you're bi, the Albert Kennedy Trust may be of use - they're Manchester based and help young people who have problems with their families as a result of being LGBT http://www.akt.org.uk/

I don't think anyone is disputing that.

However, the referendum is the start of the process - it does not create independence in itself. A yes vote signifies Scotland's intent - the day after the vote it will still be part of the UK and EU.

In the period between a yes vote and the date of secession from the UK, the EU will have to decide how best to resolve the situation.

The former EC Director General [has described](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/8766-scotlands-right-to-eu-membership-very-clear-says-former-ec-director-general) Scotland's membership request as ""very clear"" and ""I think that one has to start form the position that Scotland territorially is already part of the EU.  I think that one has to start from the position that Scotland's people – Scottish people – are already citizens of the EU and I think that does make a difference to how it will colour the discussion.""

There is no advantage to anyone in the EU for temporarily ejecting Scotland only to bring them back in later. The EU project is designed to intertwine countries economies, and reversing that process provides no benefit to anyone.

My feeling is that the UK secession and EU accession would simply be set for the same day.

I doubt that there are many party members from any party that follows and agree to every single party policy down to the word, parties have dozens of policies and the only way I can see members agreeing with every one 100% is if they were the one that made the party and chose all the policies. 

But anyway that's still not the point. The ""policy"" that they point out is that they say he is going against is that migration is fueling demand and raising the house prices by a lot and that British families should be given priority. So to follow that policy he should have to reject people based on where they're from which he can't do, and he has to rent his house out for much below the current market price where it would be if migrants weren't causing price raises? Yeah because that seems fair. 

The reasons they have those polices though is so that they can be enforced if they ever get into power. It's not something an individual can do. I couldn't cause house prices to fall alone and offer my house for the lower price. It's not even something meant for individuals to enforce or whatever. 

It's not like UKIP has said ""everybody should be recycling"" and then this guy actually never recycles. Because that's something he can do alone. He can't do something that will lower house demand by not allowing housing benefits to migrants for 5 years, that's a government policy. 

Yeah whatever, I don't know that much about these policies but it just sounds like a dumb thing to point out because a single person can't follow the policy that they claim he isn't following. It would be like saying he is breaking UKIPs policy of leaving the EU because he is still in the EU by being in the UK..

Most likely he gets more money begging on the streets than he would from the dole, but that's his choice if he doesn't want to claim.

&gt; What rights to welfare do homeless people have?

The same as anyone else.

&gt; Can they claim?

Absolutely. You can make a ""Declaration of local connection"" in order to claim if you have no fixed abode.

&gt; He doesn't have any form of identification. Apparently this is something he needs to do anything. He said he has spoken to homeless charities in order to get a birth certificate and they would neither give him the money to get one, nor accompany him to the place to get it to ensure he doesn't spend the money on other things.

Assuming he is telling the truth, he is saying that he would rather spend the money you give him on alcohol or drugs than on a birth certificate that would allow him to claim.

A birth certificate copy is not expensive. It's half a day's begging if that, even less time if he begs somewhere with a lot of foot traffic.

If you are really concerned then why don't you offer to go to the library with him and pay the £9.25 on his behalf?

https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate

I'm pretty certain that the excuses will come thick and fast when you offer practical help rather than cash.

&gt; When I see him he tells contradictory stories. One time he might say how he doesn't ask for money and he understands that people would much rather buy him food. Another time he will say he is hungry and I will offer him food but will ask for money instead.

Of course he is lying - he wants the money so that he can spend it on drugs or alcohol.

&gt; And so my question is. What can I actually do to help?

I'm going to be down voted to hell, but in all likelihood there is very little that you can actually do to help this person.

Any offers of practical help from you (such as paying for identification) will be refused in favour of cash because he doesn't actually want that help. 
The overwhelming majority of beggars are either homeless through choice or have homes but beg anyway to fund an addiction.

There are lots of charities and schemes out there to help people such a this, but it's a persistent problem because many people on the streets don't actually want to be helped; they don't want the mandatory addiction counselling or methadone regime that a shelter will impose on them, or they don't want the hassle of signing on and looking for work when begging earns ten more money.

&gt; Should I refuse to give him cash?

Yes.

&gt; Should I buy him food?

Personally I would, yes. 

The knock on effect is that they will have more money as a result for alcohol or drugs, but at least they will have had something to eat that day.

&gt; Should I assist him in getting a form of identification.

You can offer, but I would be deeply, deeply surprised if they accept the help.

&gt; How can I help a homeless individual get themselves into a position where they do not need to ask people on the street for food and money.

You must differentiate between someone who is a temporary rough sleeper due to being kicked out of their home or ending a relationship, and someone who actively chooses to live on the streets.

There are lots of agencies and charities who are very good at spotting the former and giving them the help they need to get back on their feet (and these people will take the help), whereas the latter generally don't actually want the help and will actively refuse it.",0,1393158611,null,0,false,0,cfmi1b4,t3_1yp3sc,t1_cfmi1b4,t3_1yp3sc,null,1432521467,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You are aware that people don't just show up and walk away with a box of food, yes?

I am aware of that yes.
If a food bank does not exist in a town, the local GP cannot refer anyone to it. When one opens in the town. The GP can start referring people. This leads to more people using food banks than in the past.
Do you think that hundreds of people suddenly started to starve, just as the food bank opened? Were people starving before the food bank opened? if so, why is the story not that there is a 400% increase in the number of people starving and undernourished in this country. That would be a story, that would be a real tragedy. But its not the case. What is true is that there are more people using food banks, so politicians and the media use that to get people worked up. it doesn't matter what the facts are, lets just find another story to get angry about.

&gt;They generally require a voucher issued by either their GP or a community worker confirming that they aren't able to support themselves and are in essence facing starvation.

What do you mean by confirming? Blood tests? Do they go round your house and check your cupboards? If you tell your GP you are struggling to feed your family, you will be referred. No body want to use a food bank, but that doesn't mean they need to either. Lots of people could argue they are struggling. Lots of people would benefit and be helped by being able to access food banks. That does not mean they would starve if they didn't have access to them.  


&gt;Honestly, yours is the most deplorably objectionable rationalisation for the spread of food-banks I've read.

Are you offended as much by every opinion that you don't share?

I think that the poor and vulnerable of this country need a lot more help than they are currently getting. My girlfriend works with special needs children, and I've met families who are really struggling, I understand how difficult life can be for a lot of people. But my argument is simply over that fact that an increase in food bank use does not prove an increase in people starving and unable to feed themselves. If you want to prove that, you should find some figures that support that. 

&gt;it's the underlying acceptance that this is not an outrage in the fifth largest economy on the Earth in the twenty-first century.

Food banks can definitely help people who are struggling. That is obvious, they would be helpful to anyone, anywhere at any point in time. If you offer comparatively lower paid families free food, it will leave them with more income to spend on other things, thus making their life easier. No-one is arguing that. 
But are more people starving? Or do they just find their services useful? I think that if there was such a huge increase in the number of family's that were really in trouble, that would be the story. There would be report after report of children going hungry, fainting in class because they hadn't eaten all day, but there are not. if there is a real and growing problem of families not being able to feed themselves, why are we only hearing about it through the prism of a potentially unrelated increase in food bank usage, and not directly as a true ""national outrage"".

Prepare a little about why you want to take part in the access course, why do you want to get into nursing? Using the old cliche 'I want to help people' is a good starting point maybe, but they will be wanting something more personal than that. So maybe do a little research on what opportunities the access course will open up for you, and draw on past experiences to show your motivation i.e. why you want to get into nursing.

But overall, the best thing you can do is to show confidence. You are not going there to be interviewed, you are going there to find out if the course will be worth your time. Ask them questions about the course to find out what you will be learning (This shows an interest). When talking with them try to prepare answers, but don't seem like you are reading from a script. My advice is spend a couple of hours thinking about and writing down your answers in detail, then throw them away.

Thanks for your suggestions. I will most likely mention the ability he has to claim welfare and will see how the interaction goes when I bring up his lack of ID again. He does repeatedly talk about how he stays away from beggers who do drugs and generally unfavourably about them. But obviously that is probably a blindingly great tactic to get money if it is a lie. 

I will be thinking more critically when I next see him - I think that first interaction where nothing at all was asked of me except to engage in conversation blinded me of the possibilities. 

People say that it is easy to identify the 'fakers' - e.g the comments in the guardian article posted by another commenter. Maybe that is true and I'm being naive in my dealings with this person but I find it hard to say conclusively whether he is just a 'professional begger' or a legitimate homeless person who has been indoctrinated into seeing himself as a 'scrounger'. 

The reason for this is that he is worth the conversation - an interesting guy by all accounts - so when it comes up that he needs food or whatever it is a bit of a weird moment to assume, after a conversation, that anything I do is simply aiding a drug habit.

As far as the winning while in multiple competition things goes, I agree with you. We should be able to do it, and if we can't, then we won't succeed in the Champions League.

I think the way I've been viewing it is more from a perspective of - Chelsea, Arse, and City won't likely fall far enough at this point to be overtaken by Spurs. Possible - but not likely.

Liverpool are out best shot, and they're out of every other competition, meaning a fully fit and rested squad for each match, barring injury or suspension.

I also just want to clarify that my statement about losing to Benfica was meant in the pretense that we would face them with our weakest squad. Obviously, if we go in with the intent of winning, we'll have every opportunity to do so.

No because Wordpad has been included since XP and is capable of opening Word files perfectly fine.

Using an open source program (depending on which ones they choose from the vast array of options, and hoping that all businesses around the UK decide on using the same or compatible ones) will cause far more headaches than MS Office ever has.

""open source"" doesn't mean ""every single thing will work with this"". **Standards** are what help things work together. And MS Office supports many more standards than a lot of the open source options available today.

The ""large disruption"" will be the fact that everyone will suddenly start finding out that their software may or may not support the file types that the government decide to use - meaning they will then have to download and rollout yet more software to their staff machines (this sounds easy if you're an IT pro with a proper network, but for many small businesses it's a huge hassle to attempt software upgrades on the two old PCs they may have been using for the past 6 years).

By that argument, every file format is a standard.

Word has been able to open and save in ODF format just fine since a plugin for Office 2007, and its been built in to 2010, 2013 and even now Office Online. Likewise though, the OOXML format has meant its been far easier for other office suites and third party documentation generation tools to be created that can create any kind of document in the format, not just a basic one via reverse engineering as used to happen with DOC.

What I think is the more damning thing is the fact that, the way the article is written, seems to imply the current standard in government is -still- the old DOC, XLS and PPT formats, not the 'X' versions.

&gt;(a) that the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family; or

&gt;(b) that the termination of the pregnancy is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; or

&gt;(c) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated

&gt;(d) that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.

With the risks of pregnancy being inherently greater than not being pregnant, this means doctors can always approve an abortion.

Yes, with such inspired decisions as putting Metro on Windows Server 2012. Since when do you need a tablet oriented interface on a system that will never be a tablet or have pen/finger based input?

Metro offers no real improvement for me, only hassle - even if I knew how to do everything (and it's not intuitive, where does it make it clear how to get that charms bar thing up for example, and why are there two versions of everything like IE, picture viewer, control panel? Why do I need full screen apps on a desktop?) I don't see why I need it. That's why I will stay on 7 until something better comes along, and I have licences for 8 sitting around.

MS are not used to doing business like this and it is (rightly) scary. They are used to pushing products into the market from their monopoly position and having the market accept their offering. The UK Gov is proposing to create a significant market demand for fully working ODF functionality in office suites. Microsoft isn't used to responding to market demand, especially in their office suite and this particular demand threatens their business model.

ODF would provide a level playing field for any software house to produce an office suite. That would mean that office suites would compete on features rather than whether they can hit the moving and partially cloaked target of the dominant file format.

The Government has a responsibility *not* to make documents available in proprietary formats because it enables market capture.

Microsoft could make ODF work if they wanted to. They claim to be supporting the little guy who can't afford to upgrade to the latest MSO version. Well, when they faced the same issue in introducing OOXML they decided a patch would be all that was necessary to protect the little guy from the costs of forced upgrade. That was at a time when vastly more people were using versions of MSO which could not read OOXML than cannot read ODF today. So, they've already fixed the problem to their satisfaction on a bigger scale. Of course, this is entirely discounting the fact that LibreOffice is free and is perfectly happy with ODF, so a free upgrade is all that is needed. Actually, it's likely to be preferable since MSO that can't read ODF is either likely or certainly pre-ribbon and therefore the LibreOffice interface will be more familiar to the users than the latest MSO offerings.

The problem being that there is no standard.  How should the software encode embedded commas, quotes, unicode characters and so on?  These things can usually be configured by preferences, import and export options, and on so, but unless we agree on what those options should be we'll all end up producing slightly different variants of CSV.

e.g.

    One,""Two,Three""

Should that yield two values:

    One
    Two,Three

Or three:

    One
    ""Two
    Three""

(anyone who has ever had to export a timber cutting list, or the heights of people in feet and inches will know how much fun it isn't working with value like 6"", 5'6"" and so on)

A far better format for text-base data exchange is JSON.  It is the de-facto data exchange format of the web and thus is far more future-proof than CSV.  It is open, free, well-defined, and unambiguous.  It permits a much richer data structure (e.g. nested/hierarchical data structures) and is supported by every web browser and all major programming languages.

Obviously Star Trek doesn't have a single character running through every iteration of the series but Spock is maybe referenced in the most stories. He clearly echoes into Next Generation- the whole point of Data is sort of a reverse Spock, because Data is trying to become more human while Spock was always trying to fight (or at least balance) his human impulses against his Vulcan cultural preference for logic and controlled emotions.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"'The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism – are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.

They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.

But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life – educated men who live in the East End – coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins.'

An addiction Microsoft Office is the main reason individual users are reluctant to switch to Linux. Switching to ODF on Windows is the first step towards a transition which is why Microsoft have started to campaign that it must not be done (I'd argue that while OOXML is allowed as a default option, any change is actually cosmetic, most people will stick with the default). 

If the Gov got its house in order with slowly converting to ODF with Python rather than VBA macros, a relatively smooth transition could be made to Linux. There would be a large cost involved, but it would be worth it to the Gov over time in additional security, interoperability and would benefit society at large by releasing the improvements to the code base it made to get everything working.

true,SweetNyan,null,null,"You're right that its a mess, but ultimately it comes down to this: if there was someone grabbing onto your back with no way to get them off without killing them, surely killing them is reasonable, if regrettable. I don't really think the process is easy or trivial... it isn't something you can just walk into, it costs money for one thing, and its quite invasive. I find it strange that pro-life people are often opposed to accessible contraceptives, too. They're proven to reduce abortions more than anything else.

&gt;I also don't like that after the act of ejaculation, men are powerless in these decisions and can lose a child they want, or have one they don't want, while women make these decisions because they rightly retain control their bodies.

How can this be legislated? Either you give men the right to abandon their children, forcing the child to be brought up by just one parent, or you allow the man to make choices that intervene directly on a woman's right to control her own body. Having a child is hard, and an unplanned/loss of a child really sucks, for both men and women. But I think ultimately it comes down to this: we should, as a society, respect both a man and woman's right to control their own body.

In some ways, my knee jerk reaction to 'what about the father' is ""should the father be forced to pay for half of the abortion costs?"". If we consider the child to be the sum of two people, then the answer is yes. But in our society, we say that it is wrong for someone to be forced to pay for an operation that isn't their own, so we accept that the father does not have responsibility over the woman's body.

Also, I don't think abortion should be seen as 'I don't want to have a kid'. It should be seen as 'I don't want this fetus to be in my body'. I don't like abortion being seen as a contraception, just part of someone's right to bodily autonomy.",0,1393168303,null,0,false,0,cfmk96b,t3_1yp11i,t1_cfmk96b,t1_cfmjuo8,null,1432522512,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

* Allen changed the game. Brought some control, pressing and drive to the team. Himself, Henderson and Flanagan carried the team for the final 10 minutes.
* On Flanagan, what a performance again. I'm glad Johnson is back and looks well, but there's no way we can take Flanno out of the team at the minute. He looks so assured and his attacking play seems to be coming along well.
* We need Sakho back in defence alongside Skrtel or Agger. Period.

It depends which modules you take, really - some of them are just as science-y as the normal Biology modules, but with a much more specific human/ primate focus, whereas others of them are much more arts-y and more social anthropology in style.

For example, there are modules on molecular ecology, ancient DNA, and other genetics topics which involve proper lab work and so on. On the other hand, there are also modules on culture and technology in humans and other primates, which tend to be more humanities-based in approach. Basically, you can go in either direction, whichever you find more interesting. It's important that you have a reasonable understanding of evolution and a bit of grounding in genetics, but you don't need to know anything like as much as the NatScis do. 

re: graduate fields in other topics - you can usually blag it as a 'proper' science on applications, but I wouldn't guarantee it...

I really enjoyed doing BioAnth - although I did it while it was still Arch &amp; Anth, rather than HSPS, so it may have changed a little. It covered some really interesting topics, and it was nice to be able to go into loads of details on some really specific human evolution topics. On the other hand, I spent more time than I care to remember learning about hand axes and stick-wielding chimpanzees. 

Oh, and I also found that you had basically no work to do for a lot of the time, and then would get a load of essays all at once for a frantic fortnight towards the end of term. So, if (like me) you consider locking yourself away for a few all-nighters a fair price for having weeks free at a time, then it's great fun...

Keynote was possible because there was no MS Office for Apple at that time and therefore no firmly entrenched ""standard"" that everyone used because it was the standard. That provided the space for innovation. 

I wouldn't discount the possibility that Microsoft ported Office to Apple to prevent such innovation from crossing to a document writer and spreadsheet, thus providing a popular alternative office suite that might be ported to Windows. As it is, MS Office came in, occupied that market niche and slammed the door behind it.

Google your local force to find out the complaints procedure and also e mail the Chief Constable and the Police Commisioner for your area. You should not have to deal with this.

My guess is it's some jobsworth trying to fob you off, they should sort this and I think they will if you get the complaint to a person in authority. They will have plenty of approved sub contractors on their books who could do this work if authorised.

&gt; Why would any political party change their mind about this AFTER the split? Surely they would agree to a currency share now, and attempt to convince the Scotts that xxx Party is on their side now.

I agree it would be more sensible for everyone to be honest and upfront about everything but in the past politicians have proven to be anything but, [see the McCrone Report being hidden by the government](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4238744.stm) in the run up to the 1979 referendum to quell support for devolution and independence.

Putting aside the question of whether or not the Westminster parties will change their minds in the event of a yes vote, their main goal with regards to the referendum is to secure a no vote. Saying that the pound won't be shared is an effective scaremongering tactic and creates much uncertainty, in such situations people tend to favour the status quo. Considering this it could be argued that the main reason behind such announcements are not based on the merits of a post yes currency union but is simply a political tactic to leverage a no vote.

Sturridge wasn't bad when he played for us, as a matter of fact he was our top striker when he left. But, he had minimal opportunity given to him and there was no way we could have just shipped off Torres. We never bought a world class prolific striker that was on their prime or on form. The ones we bought were either on the decline, aging or not a high profile strikers. Even when we bought The legend Drogba, he wasn't a high profile striker. Only Jose saw greatness in him. Buying Torres was a very big mistake. Because, when we bought him he was really poor for both Liverpool and Spain. He was arguably the worst striker at 2010 world cup (playing for the best team in the world and surrounded by amazing midfielders. Yet, he miserably failed to score a goal.) Shockingly, we still went for him. Liverpool sold us damaged goods. His last season at Liverpool he was injury prone and we still overlooked that. Football pundits started this chorus of ""he was the best striker in the league and we ruined him"". Well, in his career he only scored once more than 20 league goals! We could easily have bought him when he was at Atletico. But, we didn't want to pay more. Few years later, we then end up paying more than the double. We could have bought Aguero, but his wages put us off. We could have bought Falcao when he was at Porto or River Plate. But, we decided to wait till he got more expensive. We did the same thing with Cavani. There are countless players who we failed to buy. And only tried to buy them when they were very expensive, older or even injury prone.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; In my personal opinion there should be law about this sort of thing: If your case goes to court and it is found that you owe the money there should also be the possibility of charging the defendant with the costs associate with bringing the case (the cost of the forensic accountants and lawyers). 

The default with the Tax Tribunal system is that the appellant and respondent each pay their own costs.  They can make an application for costs, in which case the losing party pays.  In theory HMRC could make an application for costs in each case.

My recollection is that an application for costs needs to be made at the time of the original applications to the Tribunal, rather than after you know you won.  *(Otherwise every time a taxpayer won they'd apply for costs.)*

&gt;One of the reasons that people get away with this sort of thing is that it's so costly for the government to go after this. If there was a counter risk for the people trying to avoid tax then maybe tax avoidance wouldn't cost us so much.

That's a really over-simplified way of looking at it.

A lot of tax avoidance schemes are extremely complicated.  The core of what he was exploiting there was that if you make a loss from a trade you can set that loss against your other income when calculating your liability to tax.  All the other shenanigans are to disguise the fact that he wasn't really engaged in a trade and to engineer the loss.  *(It's worth appreciating in these cases that the loss is invariably just a loss on paper.  The aim is to gain a larger tax advantage than you spent on it.  It's in no way comparable to your starting a trade in used cars and genuinely losing money on it.)*  Investigating and unravelling these things is difficult and takes a lot of time and effort.

HMRC isn't sufficiently resourced to challenge all the avoidance going on.  If you have a rummage around Richard Murphy's site *(the one linked to this story)* you'll see his estimates of the Tax Gap are much larger than HMRC's estimates.  The Public Accounts Committee also criticised HMRC's estimates, so it's just **just** him.

HMRC's top staff aren't remunerated in the same order as their private sector counterparts.  I appreciate that the prevailing public opinion is that Civil Servants are overpaid, but if you want to be able to recruit and retain the best tax minds, you need to pay wages commensurate with what they'd get on the other side.  On top of this, since the Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise merged staff numbers have shrunk from around 120,000 to about 60,000.  This will shrink to around 52,000 in the next couple of years.  The ideological drive to shrink the state has left it too stripped back to fully police the system.

HMRC's obligations under the DPA force it to hide what's going on.  Moyles applied to the Tribunal to have the hearing in secret and anonymised because he knew full well that this could damage his earning potential.  *(I think that's actually inaccurate, since being publicly reviled only seems to last a couple of days.  Just look at Jimmy Carr.)*  My personal preferred solution to this would be to make the register of disclosable avoidance schemes a public record.  Change the law so you don't get a deduction for avoidance scheme derived losses or expenses if you're not on the public register.  *(There ARE things that DOTAS catches that aren't particularly  offensive.)*

On top of all these criticisms of HMRC, bear in mind that they can't crow about their successes unless they drag you through a Tribunal and they can only do that if you insist on a court hearing.  This means that a lot of the good work that HMRC does can never be publicly recognised.  If Moyles had accepted that the scheme didn't work and agreed to pay the tax and interest it would never have gotten to the Tribunal and HMRC could never have pointed it out.",0,1393175006,null,0,false,0,cfmmlex,t3_1yp7xi,t1_cfmmlex,t1_cfmiuga,null,1432523682,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Your opinion, but if you said ""do you want to spend a bit more now and make sure we aren't forced to buy again from one company in the future"" the answer might change.

The benefit is that you don't have to buy MS Office at whatever price they want for eternity, and that compatibility is assured in the future. Being able to nix Office also means not being reliant on the platforms Office runs on (er... Windows)

1) Joe Allen was absolutely fantastic. His pressing of the opposition really is wonderful to watch.

2) Mignolets' shot stopping ability is very good; the rest of his play is a little worrying. His starting position needs to be a lot better IMO.

3) Martin Skrtel needs to learn how to read the game better. Jamie Carraghers' best attribute was his ability to read potentially dangerous situations and get into a position to deal with said situations. It is well documented that Skrtel is very hands-on inside our penalty area from corners/free kicks, which perhaps would not be the case if he could read the game better. He got punished today.

4) Coutinho can deliver for about 70 minutes. He drifts out of games after this point.

5) Luis Suarez looked tired towards the end of the game.

The Labour Party are really not handling independence well: from torpedoing Scottish Labour's devolution tax plans to scare stories about having to drive on the right, they really could not do more to fail to make the case for the UK if they tried.

Scottish Labour's biggest problem is that they are being seen as campaigning with the Conservatives. A lot of their natural supporters in Scotland are looking at the SNP's centre-left policies (now, or after a yes) and wondering why their party seems to be opposing them rather than proposing them.

Their current Scottish leadership is certainly dire, but I don't know if the wider party realise how adrift they seem to be.

I'm in a fairly similar situation as the OP where I've befriended a homeless guy. He used to ask for cash, of which I occasionally gave him a couple of quid and of course I know he was going to spend it on booze, he's an alcoholic.

But lately, as he knows I've got a pretty significant whisky collection, he's constantly been pestering me for a dram of whisky, and then another then another. I've on a few occasions relented and given him a few drams - I know it's not exactly the best course of action, giving an alcoholic booze but he's in a situation and anything to take the edge off I guess.

A mate of mine, who has also befriended Dave, and I have offered to help him beyond giving him the odd sandwich and socks (I gave him a few pairs over Christmas as I thought it'd help a bit) and the occasional can of beer or dram of whisky. But now it seems he's becoming a bit reliant on us for that and not other help that might someway go towards getting him out of his situation, which we've offered.

I don't think for a minute Dave chooses to live under a bridge and I can't imagine many people, homeless or otherwise, would. I just think he's either too proud to take help or too lazy to do what it would take to get off the streets. I suspect the latter, sadly.

I know he's not a total arsehole because he's absolutely broken down in front of my mate and I on a couple of occasions. I'm not sure what to do because certainly I don't intend to break any further into my whisky collection.

I guess - the 'opinion' in these cases has come from teams of around a dozen people that spend several months creating the report; I'm not sure there's much value in commissioning that sort of thing just to say 'well that's just your opinion' if it doesn't conclude with the answer you want. Alternatively, Go find how many contract ads ask for ODF or Open Office experience.

&gt;Usage in corporations is not relevant.

And you base this on what? In most systems, every gov. site works around what private industry uses. If you assert otherwise, you're crediting them with far more influence and spending power than they actually have. And that's before we get to the likes of ESX 5.5 working out as a lot more expensive than Hyper-V these days.

&gt;Then perhaps you could present some actual figures, preferably backed up with fact.

I don't really need to present an argument to confirm what anyone in local government IT will tell you. If you choose not to believe me, fine - but you'll have to do your own googling/ FOI requests.

&gt;Your opinion

You're suggesting it's in the minority?

&gt;but if you said ""do you want to spend a bit more now and make sure we aren't forced to buy again from one company in the future"" the answer might change.

Sure, most taxpayers would gladly fork out to allow councils to not use what they themselves are running at home....er...

&gt;The benefit is that you don't have to buy MS Office at whatever price they want for eternity, and that compatibility is assured in the future.

Which, ultimately, isn't that much - and guarantees you can open and save stuff from any other site; the vast majority of which run MS Office.

&gt;Office has its own compatibility issues across versions of Word/Excel etc.

Hardly worth mentioning, it's never been a showstopper - certainly not compared to the fun of trying to convert from other formats - and that's not including the ongoing costs.

&gt;""Evangelists"" indeed.

Indeed. I've never met anyone pushing that kind of agenda who actually works in the sites they insist can do it with no problems.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; As for Moyles himself, the question needs to be answered.... at any point in this was he aware he was making a misrepresentation?

Taken from the Tribunal decision.  Unedited in any way, other than the bolding is mine:

-42. When asked why he had not simply invested £10,000 (the amount of the deposit in his case) in a car business, but had instead incurred fees (that is, the fees payable to NTA) in the order of £460,000, he answered, very candidly, that he had entered into what he emphasised was a lawful tax avoidance scheme. **He accepted that the loss he had “suffered” was neither genuine nor commercially driven. **

-43. Mr Flanagan, too, was open about his motives—he had, he said, looked around for a tax avoidance scheme in conjunction with his financial advisers, and had rejected several schemes because he did not feel comfortable with them. He chose this scheme because of the favourable opinion of leading counsel, and because he too received reassurances from his advisers about the extent of his exposure to risk, which he recognised to be very limited. He had what he described as a layman’s understanding of the scheme, as he had seen a slideshow 
presentation of it, but like Mr Stennett he took no interest and played no part in the trading activities, and was indifferent about whether or not they were profitable; the £7,500 he had injected was money he was quite willing to lose as it was a small sum in comparison with the potential tax saving, and he knew he would not have to inject more. **He agreed that the size of the loan he took was dictated solely by the scale of the tax deduction he wished to achieve, and had no 
commercial rationale.** He accepted too that he could easily have paid the £7,500 used as a deposit without any borrowing. 

-44. Mr Moyles, as I have said, did not give oral evidence, and I had from him only a very brief and rather uninformative statement. **It is however quite clear from the statement that he, too, entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving, and that he took no interest in the trade.** His evidence was supplemented by that of Mr Smith, his accountant and tax adviser, who evidently did have some understanding of the workings of the scheme. **He agreed that it had no real purpose other than a saving of tax, and that Mr Moyles entered into it on that basis.** He was not concerned, said Mr Smith, about the risk that he would be exposed to a large borrowing, but was anxious to be reassured that the scheme was lawful, and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself. **He agreed that the scale of Mr Moyles’ borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve, in his case £1 million, and that the trading was not carried on for its own sake but was merely a means to an end; this was not, he agreed, a commercial means of borrowing for the purposes of an intended trade.** I had no direct evidence that Mr Moyles could provide a deposit of £5,000, as it was in his case, without borrowing, but as he paid fees of £95,000 from a bank account in his name it is an obvious inference that he could have done. 

Did he know that he wasn't really trading in used cars?  Yes.

Did he know that the loss he was claiming to have made didn't really exist?  Yes.

Did he know that the scheme existed solely to abuse a perceived flaw in the tax system?  Yes.

Did he know that the scheme wasn't viable in the strictest sense?  No.  **But** this is the same sort of thing as my claiming that my using a Nigerian 419 scam to empty your bank account isn't illegal, because you signed off some small print.",0,1393176878,null,0,false,0,cfmncq3,t3_1yp7xi,t1_cfmncq3,t1_cfmmhzk,null,1432524039,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Open source works great for a product when you can charge for support, or training or through other streams. For some products this isn't very profitable though. Products like Office wouldn't make nearly as much if open sourced, since those other streams wouldn't bring in nearly as much as what MS charges upfront now. 

&gt;I'm not sure what this if proof of other than there being no correlation between software licence and quality.

Photoshop cost X man hours to build. If no company finds it commercially viable to spend that number of hours on an open source solution, then the closed source one is the better one.

You have to say that Luis is also the key to Gerrard wanting to sit back as he fully trusts Luis with the play making in the final third.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; And you base this on what? In most systems, every gov. site works around what private industry uses. If you assert otherwise, you're crediting them with far more influence and spending power than they actually have. And that's before we get to the likes of ESX 5.5 working out as a lot more expensive than Hyper-V these days.

Because the problem here is not how corporations produce their documents, it is about how HMG should do it. 

&gt; I don't really need to present an argument to confirm what anyone in local government IT will tell you. If you choose not to believe me, fine - but you'll have to do your own googling/ FOI requests.

You're the one trying to suggest that every government publication is ridden with proprietary crud (none of the public stuff I've ever downloaded has), so the onus is on you to back it up. Saying ""I have experience, and if you don't believe me you can do your own legwork"" doesn't really do that.

&gt; Sure, most taxpayers would gladly fork out to allow councils to not use what they themselves are running at home....er...

Office supports ODF, or at least it claims to (this is MS after all). It's more like ""let's publish stuff in formats that everyone can read without paying hundreds to one company, and can continue to read in years/decades into the future"".

&gt; Which, ultimately, isn't that much - and guarantees you can open and save stuff from any other site; the vast majority of which run MS Office.

What ""the vast majority"" use is not relevant here - Office claims to support ODF, everything else supports ODF, why not use the format everyone can use, rather than what one group of users have paid for the privilege to use?

There's also the question of the home user or small business who may need to be able to read Government documents, who won't have Office, who may not even be running Windows and should not be expected to shell out in order to communicate with their own government. Crippled Word/Excel viewers are no substitute to being able to use a full office suite if one desires.

&gt; Hardly worth mentioning, it's never been a showstopper - certainly not compared to the fun of trying to convert from other formats - and that's not including the ongoing costs.

It's a suggestion of what may happen in the future. Will Office 2030 deal with the OOXML format and proprietary crud? Will we need to find old copies of Office to read old government documents? How much did 20 years' worth of Office cost vs. publishing new documents in open formats now, dealing with existing documents gradually and an eventual conversion to something like LibreOffice?

&gt; Indeed. I've never met anyone pushing that kind of agenda who actually works in the sites they insist can do it with no problems.

Who is suggesting that?

&gt; It's funny how fast specific people jump to this question

Between this and the assertion that Hyper-V is better than VMware, it does sound a bit like you're in favour of the MS-enriching status quo and it's interesting to wonder why.

&gt; not so unusual is that it's never come from a server engineer...

1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy

2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World

3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death, Logopolis. 

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Caves of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it

This may not be completely the same as say The Doctor's Tardis, or Jack's/River's jumper, perhaps some kind of time chamber (a similar idea to how the Cult of Skaro survived the Time War in the sphere). Since she doesn't need to go back in time this could work. 

Bumping into the *right* person is something the Doctor seems to specialise in, especially if the Tardis has anything to do with it, see Clara, Rose, or Donna as BIG examples, or more minor characters like Cpt Jack, or Wilfred. So I don't see why a link between Jenny - the Tardis - the Doctor couldn't somehow bring them together, especially since they share DNA. 

Jenny may not have anything directly to do with Gallifrey right now, but nothing says her as a character can't develop an interest in her Time Lord genesis, can it not?

Which is great, as long as HMG don't interact with any private companies at all.

&gt;You're the one trying to suggest that every government publication is ridden with proprietary crud 

Except that I wasn't suggesting that. I'm talking about government *systems*, and how a) you can't remove office because of plugins, scripts etc. and b) why interoperating with any outside company demands the highest compatibility possible.

&gt; so the onus is on you to back it up.

No, it isn't. Nothing will change whether you believe me or not, but only one of us has a real interest in demonstrating otherwise.

&gt;It's more like ""let's publish stuff in formats that everyone can read without paying hundreds to one company, and can continue to read in years/decades into the future"".

Which brings zero tangible benefit. There's far too much integration to Office to reduce it's worth to 'if we can save in something else, it can go'.

&gt;What ""the vast majority"" use is not relevant here

Yes, it is. Enormously.

&gt;Office claims to support ODF

And you would be introducing the need for conversion...why?

&gt;everything else supports ODF

Nobody uses anything else in any real numbers.

&gt; rather than what one group of users have paid for the privilege to use?

This is where you're giving away your agenda. I can highlight the lack of use for Open Office. You, on the other hand, have to resort to describing the most popular s/w on the plant as 'one group of privileged users'. That's where descriptions like 'Evangelist' come from.

&gt;It's a suggestion of what may happen in the future. Will Office 2030 deal with the OOXML format and proprietary crud

No corporation (or local government) usually cares when they'll be buying MS Office regardless. Unless, of course, the number of OOXML users (and certainly corporations) reach any numbers - when they do, I'll start seeing contracts asking for experience...but it hasn't happened yet and as pointed out, taxpayers have a number of more worthy causes that the money could go on.

&gt;Will we need to find old copies of Office to read old government documents?

Not sure that's ever happened before now, so not sure why it would be expected.

&gt;Who is suggesting that?

I was highlighting how the sort of 'why not? what would be so hard?' opinion is one you *never hear from people on the ground*, but that doesn't stop the likes of redditors asserting whatever they *want* to be the case as fact.

I was involved with the Windows 8 UAT test at one very large site, and the users hated Metro (funnily enough). I pointed this out on reddit, only to be greeted by 'what do you know? that's just your opinion....' and so on, as if my sites' findings were totally at odds with the norm and could be dismissed if they were merely my opinion. Sound familiar?

&gt;Between this and the assertion that Hyper-V is better than VMware

That was to point out that Hyper-V is *cheaper*, not better, than VMware and therefore offers better vfm when dealing with licenses.

&gt;it does sound a bit like you're in favour of the MS-enriching status quo and it's interesting to wonder why.

Your misinterpretation of the previous statement about Hyper-V suggests (again) that you're looking for an excuse to make the connection in the first place.

&gt;How is this relevant in a discussion over Office suites?

Some things I noticed.

1) Unlucky that Spurs lost Capoue so early on.  Left Bentaleb to go into that position in front of the back 4.  Sub Chadli on.  Ok not too bad.  I personally would've gone with Eriksen, more creativity and more likely for something too happen.  But Chadli is more physical and should've been good enough.

2) Entire first half.  Dire.  Absolutely awful.  Come out second half... no change.  Ok lets see if a half time bollocking woke them up.

Nope 50 minutes... ok time to think of a change.  This isn't working.

55 minutes - Tim time for a change... Tim... what are you doing... seriously change something...

60 minutes - My god Tim do something!  Nothing has changed!  U just wasted 15 freaking minutes on this crap.  CHANGE!!

65 Minutes - CHANGE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GO... oh there we go Soldado coming on.  2 strikers up front good decision but who to take off.  Well we have Paulinho who has been pretty bad like everyone else but can score goals and make something out of nothing, plus international experience or we have Bentaleb who can pick a good pass but very rarely creates... oh look u've subbed Paulinho.  Ok well this might work.

It didn't.

3) Why is Lennon always cutting in.  The only reason i can see is that he's been told too.  Instead of using his pace to beat the fall back he cuts inside, thus completely negating his one advantage over most players.  Norwich packed the midfield so Spurs couldn't play.  Yes lets run into the middle and make it more crowded instead of stretching Norwich and crossing to soldado and ade.  YAY logic!

There are more things that i could go into but i'm sure u all know them.

Sherwood is a manager of the future for Spurs.  Not now and not next season.  Honeymoon period is over and today showed the lack of management experience of Sherwood.  He had no plan B.  He had no idea what to do.

I think Bentaleb could prove to be a serious talent, but having him as a mainstay as we chase a really top-class Liverpool side while Eriksen is on the bench for the whole game is mind-boggling. He should be the first name on the team sheet, IN FUCKING CUP GAMES.

In which case they can conform to the standards set by the government. I can't just scribble in crayon ""I earnt this much, tax me please"" on paper and send it to HMRC, I have to use their forms and processes in the way they want me to do it. No difference here.

But according to you, every document going into or out of government has a million macros and VBA scripts and could not possibly be shared in an open format that both Office and others can use. Doubtful.

&gt; Except that I wasn't suggesting that. I'm talking about government systems, and how a) you can't remove office because of plugins, scripts etc. and b) why interoperating with any outside company demands **the highest compatibility possible.**

Quite so (bolded) - which is why we should use a format that is supported by multiple editors on multiple platforms, not one company's suite on that operating system also produced by that company. That format is ODF. Glad to see we're reaching agreement!

You're making it sound as if these mythical scripts are an insurmountable barrier (and have yet to provide statistics on how much stuff produced by government includes them).

&gt; No, it isn't. Nothing will change whether you believe me or not.

The generally accepted principle is that if you want to state something as fact, you should be able to back it up. Saying ""I r rite"" does not make it so.

&gt; Which brings zero tangible benefit. There's far too much integration to Office to reduce it's worth to 'if we can save in something else, it can go'.

Zero benefit? Really? I'm sure all those journalists clamoring for stuff under the 30 year rule in the future will be glad that they can't read those explosive memos on David Kelly or whatever, as they're in a format Microsoft abandoned and no one has software to read it.

&gt; And you would be introducing the need for conversion...why?

The point was that Office supports ODF - no suggestion over conversion, but it's obvious that conversion is the right thing to do in time, for the same reasons why new stuff should be produced in an open format.

&gt; Nobody uses anything else in any real numbers

Because they're forced to use Office as everyone uses its proprietary format. Can you not see the problem here?

Regardless, we should be dealing with accessibility to everyone on every platform, not Office users on Windows.

&gt; This is where you're giving away your agenda. I can highlight the lack of use for Open Office. You, on the other hand, have to resort to describing the most popular s/w on the plant as 'one group of privileged users'. That's where descriptions like 'Evangelist' come from.

I have no agenda, other than as a taxpayer who would like to see the documents produced with my money being published in a format that anyone can use, not a group of people who have paid MS for the privilege. But your agenda is clear.

&gt; No corporation (or local government) usually cares when they'll be buying MS Office regardless. 

That's fine - and they can use it to save files in ODF. The point is that the government is then not beholden to MS - if they wanted to move to LibreOffice or any other ODF compliant software, it removes a barrier. Staying with OOXML means Office for the future. It also means (and I sound like a parrot here) that anyone can read those documents, as they won't all be read only by government employees.

&gt; Unless, of course, the number of OOXML users (and certainly corporations) reach any numbers - when they do, I'll start seeing contracts asking for experience...but it hasn't happened yet and as pointed out

I think this shows your lack of knowledge. OOXML is the format used by Microsoft, by default, for Office 2007+. It is .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and so on. So how many OOXML users are there? ""the vast majority"" in your words.

&gt; taxpayers have a number of more worthy causes that the money could go on.

Hi Satya! How's the new job? But in seriousness, why is the cost or justification of conversion any different to other archival efforts such as digitisation of paper document archives? The point in all cases is to ensure that they remain readable into the future.

&gt; Not sure that's ever happened before now, so not sure why it would be expected.

Because Office 2010-3 can still read Office 97 documents (mostly), so practically everything produced by government is covered. This won't be the case in 30 years time when we've had 50 or so years of data built up. 

It's ""expected"" due to the governments push to be ""digital"" - this stuff will be archived digitally (probably original files if possible), so the format used should be one that is more likely to be readable well into the future.

&gt; I was highlighting how the sort of 'why not? what would be so hard?' opinion is one you never hear from people on the ground. I was involved with the Windows 8 UAT test at one very large site, and the users hated Metro (funnily enough). I pointed this out on reddit, only to be greeted by 'what do you know? that's just your opinion....' and so on, as if my findings were totally at odds with the norm. Sound familiar?

I've seen plenty of anti-Metro/Windows 8 stuff on Reddit. I personally hate it too, and I don't know anyone who likes it. Anyone who uses Windows 8 seems to at least be using a third-party start menu.

&gt; That was to point out that Hyper-V is cheaper, not better, than VMware and therefore offers better vfm when dealing with licenses.

If cost is the only consideration, possibly. Knowing MS, Hyper-V would not be cheaper if they were anywhere near market leading.

&gt; Your misinterpretation of the previous statement about Hyper-V shows what you're looking for an excuse to make the connection.

Not a misinterpretation at all. 

&gt; Because the question only ever comes from people that have no experience of supporting MS Office on any kind of real back-end scale.

None of this means that the government can't use MSO.

How a business handles a rise in demand is absolutely central to this argument as it's exactly the situation most are in at the moment.

The economy has had a period of recession so unemployment is high and demand has been low. It is now starting to recover, demand is improving and businesses are expanding to fulfil this demand. You clearly advocate rising the minimum wage at this time.

Unlike most Premier League teams, I dont feel that we've been tainted by money. There is no Sugar Daddy. We just dont do huge transfer fees, or over-inflated salaries. Over the past few years, our team has always been built from the ground up. Finding talented players from lower leagues and giving them a shot at glory.

Many of you may argue on this point, but Norwich also doesnt subscribe to the idea of firing managers every few months when the team is on a bad run of form. And look at our Chief Exec: this result meant so much to him not on a financial level, but on an emotional one.

Our famous supporters arent rock stars or businessmen but Delia Smith and Stephen Fry. They could be the mother- and father-figures of England for god's sake!

Even down in League One more than 20,000 season ticket holders still showed up to watch us week in, week out. We packed out delapidated away stands across the country on the road. Even if Carrow Road doubled in size overnight, our supporters would still fill it easily.

And Norwich City FC *is* the city of Norwich. This beautiful, slightly backward town a couple of hours from London is intrinsically linked to our football club. I've asked many a foreigner if they've heard of Norwich: a  handful will know about the City, but many more will know about it's football club.

Today's result meant a lot to David McNally, as well as to all of us. And no matter what happens in the remaing 11 games, this club will continue to do things it's own way. The right way.

No, because that would be an online system. 

&gt;But according to you, every document going into or out of government has a million macros and VBA scripts and could not possibly be shared in an open format that both Office and others can use. Doubtful.

Easy to doubt stuff I didn't say.

&gt;which is why we should use a format that is supported by multiple editors on multiple platforms, not one company's suite on that operating system also produced by that company.

That's your goal, not the current situation.

&gt;You're making it sound as if these mythical scripts are an insurmountable barrier

They're 'mythical', now? And yes, they are an insurmountable barrier. This doesn't change simply because nobody told you.

&gt;(and have yet to provide statistics on how much stuff produced by government includes them).

This is comedy gold. If you want stats, make an FOI like everyone else - you're arguing from assumptions, which aren't the same as experience.

&gt;Saying ""I r rite"" does not make it so.

Which is why you can go find your own information. Someone on the job at the kind of site in question has given you multiple examples of why something hasn't happened and probably won't happen. So you have to find info to back up why your take is more accurate, which doesn't automatically mean I'm digging out reports for the rest of the evening just because someone on the internet has no knowledge about it. So, find me the UK contracts listed that need Open Office or ODF. If you are even partly correct, there should be a number of them.

&gt;Zero benefit? Really? I'm sure all those journalists clamoring for stuff under the 30 year rule in the future will be glad that they can't read those explosive memos on David Kelly or whatever, as they're in a format Microsoft abandoned and no one has software to read it.

Again, you give an example of something that hasn't happened and *has no reason to*.

&gt;so the format used should be one that is more likely to be readable well into the future.

As above.

&gt;I think this shows your lack of knowledge. OOXML is the format used by Microsoft, by default, for Office 2007+. It is .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and so on. So how many OOXML users are there? ""the vast majority"" in your words.

Arg, I meant ODF. But well done for jumping on that instead of addressing the point.

&gt;Hi Satya! How's the new job?

?

&gt;why is the cost or justification of conversion any different to other archival efforts such as digitisation of paper document archives?

They're completely different projects - for one thing, archiving is a one-way street; if you decide on a new *working* default format, it's an *ongoing* cost because the world won't necessarily follow your lead when they're all happily using something else.

&gt;This won't be the case in 30 years time when we've had 50 or so years of data built up. 

There's actually very little that can't be read or converted from 30 years ago. I don't see why this should become a problem.

&gt;Anyone who uses Windows 8 seems to at least be using a third-party start menu.

That's exactly what I do, on Server 2012 as well. The UAT responses we got for metro were fantastically scathing.

&gt;Knowing MS, Hyper-V would not be cheaper if they were anywhere near market leading.

With 2012 and 2012R2, it's become good enough to be a contender. Not nearly as good as ESX, but *good enough*. And the Datacentre license (that you have to buy anyway if you go with ESX) allows you to run as many copies of it as VM's as the host can handle. ESX have not helped themselves but pushing up their prices - it suggests they know the game is up.

&gt;Not a misinterpretation at all.

And yet you drew the predicted conclusion.

&gt;None of this means that the government can't use MSO.

Adding an unnecessary conversion step is not something any company is going to do when it ultimately won't make any difference.

All of this is conjecture, from both you and me. 

&gt; Also open source != free-of-charge.

No, and with some products that's fine. I'd like to see MS charge what they do for MSDN, windows, office, visual studio...etc. if all their products were open source though. They would lose a hell of a lot of money.

&gt;More development hours != better software

Of course not, but most good and complex software takes a lot of hours to create. You aren't going to knock up a replacement to Windows in an afternoon, and someone has to fund those developers or generate enough buzz to want them to do the work free.

&gt;what if independent developers cumulatively spent that number of hours on an open-source solution?

Good for them. Lots of times this happens and you get as good or better open source software than closed source alternatives, so I use these products. Hours spent is irrelevant, except that it's a non trivial number on non trivial products. 

Let's pretend some guy at rockstar is reading this thread. He is convinced by your arguments and decides to contact you.

Your two expanding businesses have done their market research and determined that there is sufficient demand to justify doubling their output. The first business - with the higher minimum wage - estimates that an extra five workers is enough to supply the extra labour required. Very well; the extra workers get hired, trained and paid, and the boss increases his profits from the extra business his company is doing. 

The second business - with the lower minimum wage - also estimates that it can double its output. The extra profits it earns, thanks to the difference between the outlay of paying the workers and the gross income from selling the product, could cover the wages of ten new workers, while still leaving the same amount of profit for the boss as in the previous example. 

Does the second business therefore hire ten workers? Of course it bloody doesn't, since the necessary work can be done by 5. Under the lower minimum wage, the workers are therefore worse off, even if more of them are employed.

If I am submitting paper forms or online data, I have to do it that way, their processes, their documents. 

&gt; Easy to doubt stuff I didn't say.

No? Your original post banged on about those items.

&gt; That's your goal, not the current situation.

It's the goal that the government currently wants, barring Microsoft lobbying. It is not the current situation, you're right, that's why the government wants to change it, and that's why we're arguing here. Get it?

&gt; They're 'mythical', now? And yes, they are an insurmountable barrier. This doesn't change simply because nobody told you.

They're not at all - it can be converted, if the will is there, assuming conversion has to happen at all (Office will probably remain the office suite of choice going forward, and as it supports both formats, there is no need for a sudden overnight conversion of every file in government, when it can be done gradually while new files are in a new format)

&gt; This is comedy gold. If you want stats, make an FOI like everyone else - you're arguing from assumptions, which aren't the same as experience.

No, you're not getting it. It seems like it's a common thing on Reddit - people who like to trumpet their credentials don't seem to like being challenged on their unsourced, unverified opinion that they are passing as fact. You are suggesting that VBA scripts, macros and proprietary gunk are a major problem, but not giving any real data. Without this, it's just a worthless opinion that means little.

&gt; Which is why you can go find your own information. Someone on the job at the kind of site in question has given you multiple examples of why something hasn't happened and probably won't happen.

No, someone who claims to be ""on the job at the kind of site in question"" has provided their own baseless opinion.

&gt; So, find me the UK contracts listed that need Open Office or ODF. If you are even partly correct, there should be a number of them.

Why is this relevant? Do you think that there were lots of people dying for Office 2010 experience when it came out, or OOXML experience when it was first used in Office 2007? Or are you of the ""must have 10 years experience in Windows 8"" type?

When the market is so entrenched in the MS way it's going to be biased toward Office. If major entities like the UK government moves to open formats, it will spur a drive for others to do the same.

&gt; Again, you give an example of something that hasn't happened and has no reason to.

Because, as I said, you're not accounting for changes in practice. It's easy to look at stuff released under the 30 year rule today, because it was all on paper and easily scanned in or readable in person. If the government is going to start archiving original files produced today, they will be doing the original OOXML files, and those may not be readable in 30 years time.

I guess not being able to read potentially damaging files might be one reason why a government should choose Office...

&gt; Arg, I meant ODF. But well done for jumping on that instead of addressing the point.

What point? Your obsession over contracts? Could you tell me how many OOXML contracts were on the market in 2007? Not many I'd bet.

&gt; ?

Microsoft CEO. 

&gt; There's actually very little that can't be read or converted from 30 years ago. I don't see why this should become a problem.

We didn't have highly proprietary and complex formats for office documents back then, nor did we have a government producing huge amounts of it in digital form, nor did the government archive in purely digital form, nor did the government expect people to send stuff digitally (other than via fax). You don't seem to understand that there is a difference between 30 years before today and 30 years in the future.

&gt; Adding an unnecessary conversion step is not something any company is going to do. Make that company a council which is desperate to save short term money, and you'll be laughed out of the room.

What conversion step? New documents are produced in ODF, and old documents can be read in OOXML (for now). Office does both, you just change the format when saving.

I had no idea who was playing out wide left for 99% of the match except for Rose who had it all to himself. I think this is the reason that Snodgrass had such a good match. He had all the time in the world out there for most of the match. We had no balance whatsoever. I was actually excited to see Chadli come on when Capoue had to come off because I assumed he would provide us with some natural width and balance, but no. He decides to try and play through the middle along with Ade, Paulinho, Dembele and even Lennon at times. The decision to overload the middle both under AVB and now Sherwood several times is baffling. Congesting the middle with more and more players only serves to lessen a players ability to be creative and have space to operate in.

Because, after all, socialists ""care"" about the poor, and those ""nasty"" libertarians only ""care"" about the rich.

They have nearly £1 trillion of Europe's Oil, 25% of Wave power and a government that actually promotes growth with businesses.

Another reason I think they'll be fine is that, As soon as you cross the boarder to England, you see the differences between Westminster and our national governments. I'm from North Wales, it was a surprise to me that English people have to pay for medicine and University in full. Where-as my house's heating and boiler was just upgraded by the Welsh government and I'm in the process of getting 1Gbps internet installed to my house (non fibre too), which is a farm in the middle of nowhere (All because of the Welsh assembly). You'll pull the ""hand outs"" card. I'll respond: with these assistances from the Government, I've got 3 business ventures planned over the coming months and years that will utilise these. Which will hopefully contribute a lot to my local community and the government that helped me so much.

Parliament and Cameron's cronies are archaic and out of touch with the people they say they serve. I don't want the Union to be broken up by Scotland's departure, But I cannot for the life of me blame them. Our main government is a joke, a bad one at that. You've got Cameron who's trying his damnedest to continue Thatcher's reign, You've got Clegg who goes against his own policies willy-nilly, Then you've got Milliband who looks about as leader like as a wet sponge, He seems like a nice guy, But he's not someone that looks like a leader. Then you've got the parties with good intentions, but absolutely no hope in hell of gaining enough votes, Then you've got closet racists, then actual racists running for parliament too.

So in closing, I want them to have independence, so that Scotland can look after their people and thrive, Whilst I look on in envy for the same to happen to Wales. But I also follow the history of the Union, Scotland, Wales, England achieved great things when unified. It would be rather sad to see that chapter end.

*****

**TL,DR:** Scotland wants independence because of the state of our current parliament, Cameron and his cronies might be the biggest piece of leverage that the Scottish government can use to motivate their people for independence. Until our collective government is improved with actual people who give a shit, Scotland will continue and inevitably will have independence.

For example: The Internet censorship, Major cuts continuing, Allowing Banks to run amok, Cutting Police, continuing foreign war- Do these sound like things that Scotland wants to be a part of?",1,1393184425,null,0,1393184790,0,cfmqmt0,t3_1yp7b4,t1_cfmqmt0,t1_cfmn3j2,null,1432525584,4,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,4

Agger and Skrtel: two very different defenders, both captains of their national squads, played the Champions League as well, played in challenging cup matches, arguable only just entering their best years! Where are we going to find replacements for players like that? 

Last but absolutely not least Sakho, a player who's also won the French title, played Champions League and iirc a French cup as well. Still only 24 he has years of his career at the top level left, a lot of room to improve and could well turn out to be one of the best defenders of his generation.

The API doesn't tell you when the first blood happens if it's before 00:00 so unless you watched the replay to find out exactly, I only know that there were 4 games that had first blood happen before the creeps spawned. 

The latest first blood in the tournament was Reason vs Forlove at 07:29

I also used the old [TI3 compendium scoring](http://dota2.cyborgmatt.com/fantasy/rules) to see how people ranked up in a fantasy league I was trying to make for epic.TWELVE (but didn't really finish in time) as I wanted to trial run it first. This is the top 10 people according to the Valve scoring system. I tried to guess as many peoples positions as possible (I counted offlanes and mids as solos).

Norwich came out, pressing us high up the field, exactly the same idea Dnipro had executed on Thursday, and once again, we couldn't handle it. It wasn't about a ""lack of execution"" or anything like that; Sherwood just got beaten by the exact same tactics 2 games in a row, 5 days apart. And part of it is because teams are no longer ignoring Bentaleb; they're capitalizing on him by jumping him in possession... exactly what happened for the Norwich goal. Exactly like what happened against Dnipro, the high midfield pressure stopped us from being able to transition the ball from defense into attack, but instead of being patient and waiting for an opening, we end up deciding to try a long ball over the top to a well-marked Adebayor, which almost invariably fails.

I love Nabil. He's got bags of potential. But he's 19, and it's absolutely absurd to be playing him so much when you have players like Roberto Soldado, Andros Townsend, Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen on the bench unable to get in the game. 

I truly do not understand what Sherwood's thinking tactically, and I'm beginning to wonder if he's thinking at all, considering that after watching Nabil get dispossessed far too easily in our own half, he felt Norwich ""caught us on the break.""

Not in the way you described.

&gt;It's the goal that the government currently wants

With no real demonstration of how it will be paid for, or how the long term costs will be covered.

&gt;barring Microsoft lobbying

It won't just be Microsoft.

&gt;people who like to trumpet their credentials don't seem to like being challenged on their unsourced, unverified opinion that they are passing as fact

I don't mind being challenged, but if you want me to do my job online for you I'll let you know my rate - otherwise, feel free to ignore what I've said and you'll find out from other means. Nothing I've said is particularly unusual or outlandish, and it's not as if you wouldn't get similar answers from the people I'm working with now *or have worked with before*.

&gt;You are suggesting that VBA scripts, macros and proprietary gunk are a major problem, but not giving any real data. Without this, it's just a worthless opinion that means little.

If you like. Find out for yourself.

&gt;No, someone who claims to be ""on the job at the kind of site in question"" has provided their own baseless opinion.

If you like. Find out for yourself.

&gt;Why is this relevant?

Because if the problems you're demanding 'proof' for didn't exist, ODF (and alternative suites) would already be far more popular than they actually are. If that were the case, they'd be asking for experience for it on the job sites.

&gt;Do you think that there were lots of people dying for Office 2010 experience when it came out

I guess you'll find it a surprise that there were.

&gt;or OOXML experience when it was first used in Office 2007?

That was more about one-shot migrations to the new .docx, .xlsx (and so on) formats; I've seen about the same number of sites use OOXML as ODF, which is to say zero. The council I'm working at *now* is moving to .docx, etc.

&gt;If major entities like the UK government moves to open formats, it will spur a drive for others to do the same.

I've never, ever seen that happen. Hospitals in the early days went for DEC Pathworks networking - but had to change to NETBIOS/ TCP/IP once it was the norm. Same for Wordperfect 5.1/ Word 1.0. I can't think of an example where the gov. has decreed a new format or system and it's become the norm. Another example of following-instead-of-leading is where councils don't currently use Windows 8, but they have to support it anyway because the public are using it and need support.

&gt;they will be doing the original OOXML files, and those may not be readable in 30 years time.

There is no precedent applicable to seriously consider this as a potential outcome. And that's before we consider that it's been the standard format, barring one major change, for over twenty years. Christ, people still write web servers for ZX Spectrums for pity's sake.

&gt;Your obsession over contracts?

If by obsession you mean 'don't go there because you'll have to ignore it once you see the ratio of jobs on offer', then yes.

&gt;Could you tell me how many OOXML contracts were on the market in 2007? Not many I'd bet.

Like 'must be experienced in Office 2007'? ;-) You're ignoring your own parameters - nobody would ask specifically for OOXML - whereas ODF is what would be asked for if a site wanted someone to cover mass conversions (unless you wanted to stick to one suite). If you'd been there in 2007, so to speak, you'd know about the huge reduction in document size that the .x format changes provided, certainly in things like PowerPoint - but then, as now, nobody bothered with any of the other formats in real numbers at all. Sites migrate in two ways - a default save change, where you leave it to happen over time as users re-save docs, or a big-bang where all the files are converted at once. The bigger the site, the more likely (to the point of being guaranteed) that they're use 3rd party systems that will use plugins, scripts, macros and generate content in the MS formats. These sites like the latter approach because they get a nice big chunk of SAN back right away, and those were the ones that tended to migrate ASAP. How much had you been intending to bet? Are you willing to bet on the number of ODF contracts? :-)

&gt;We didn't have highly proprietary and complex formats for office documents back then

Correct, we did not. But we can still read the formats, and while they have certainly gotten more complex, it's still a stretch to assert that the currently most popular format in the world could someday become unreadable - that argument only works if we're discussing an app that wasn't particularly popular even at its' height.

&gt;What conversion step?

The step for everything you receive from the outside world that isn't in the format you want. No company will take this risk, so why is government going to risk money on it? You'd have to demonstrate where they've managed to do this before for setting standards to be an option. So, as stated before, there's no tangible benefit - your only real argument has been that it might not be readable in 50 years. No council is going to spend money they haven't got addressing that - they're spending most of what they've got to upgrade their 2003 servers in time for next year, their ESX 4.1 servers to 5.5, or Hyper-V, or even XenServer (but don't take my word for it, etc.)

Think about this.

&gt; At least with AVB you felt like there was some sort of plan that he had in mind, some sort of system that could one day emerge. Sherwood just feels aimless.

You can simply flip this argument around and say with AVB there was only one plan, which didn't work, whilst with Sherwood our game is adjusted match to match. The only evidence to support it is the shitty performance. Why should a manager play who you expect them to, AVB tended to but it didn't help him get better performances.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Given a woman at work has been threatened, manipulated and taken advantage under alcohol or drug abuse, what are her legal rights?

That's pretty much cut and dry criminal behaviour, and you tell the police immediately, as well as HR within the company. The police will arrest the individual and question them, then assuming there is enough evidence the CPS will proceed with a prosecution. The person(s) accused will be banned by the police from communicating in any way with the victim, and this includes at work, and if they even so much as go near the victim they will be arrested and held on remand in prison.

The company can't ask the victim to leave the organisation during this period unless for other serious reasons, however may give them paid leave whilst the police case is ongoing. In the UK it would be ridiculous for the company to fire the victim during this time period, it would be all over the media and pretty outrageous.

The success rate of such cases is variable without knowing the details. The police will certainly arrest and question the suspect, however they need enough evidence to have a realistic chance of prosecution in a court of law in order to prosecute. The UK police take cases like this very seriously, more seriously than most other countries worldwide, including most of Europe and the US. However one persons word against anthers is always hard to prove, you need some evidence, a witness, phone calls, bruises etc. If both people were voluntarily intoxicated and sexual things occurred, then one person afterwards regretted it and that's all the police have to go on then there isn't much of a case here.

If the victim is still being harassed it would be worthwhile gaining some evidence via secret recording, such as using the sound recorder function available on most mobile phones, this is perfectly legal in the UK and is almost always accepted as evidence by a court, despite most people thinking otherwise.",0,1393188788,null,0,1393189212,0,cfmsign,t3_1yqbhy,t1_cfmsign,t3_1yqbhy,null,1432526535,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

We are not bloody good enough to get so mad about losing a game like this. We are tottenham. Not Chelsea. We are 4 and a half stars on fifa. Our main striker is adebayor.

As it seems like you don't need the money when you leave to do your PhD I wouldn't take the refund of contributions, if it's available, as you will probably then forego the employer contributions and I think you'd also have to pay 20% tax.

That leaves two options when you move on from your company; keep your pension where it is or transfer it to a new arrangement. My opinion on this depends on the management charges and whether you will be offered a pension when you do your PhD.

If you are offered a pension when you do your PhD I would transfer it in to this arrangement so that you have all your pension pot in the same place and it is easier to manage. However you will want to make sure the fees in the new arrangement aren't significantly higher than those in your existing arrangement.

As Blind1979 pointed out in their post, management fees can sometime increase once you leave your company. For example I have an Aegon Retirement Choices pension through work where they have negotiated reduced charges of 0.2% pa, but these would increase to 0.6% pa if I leave my work. You would have to see what fees you would be charged if you left your company and compare them to those available on personal pensions to work out if you should transfer or not.

This is really something to think about at a later stage however as the market may have changed by the time you have left the company, especially with the government looking at capping workplace pension charges at the moment. Unfortunately I think the caps they have been looking at are still on the high side and they have delayed them, but at least it'll eventually help those in arrangements where the fees are higher than 1% (and maybe even 0.75%).

Also, not sure if you plan on using the default fund or not but the charges I've mentioned above are on top of the fund management charges. I think Aegon's default lifestyle fund is pretty decent as it has a charge of 0.1% pa, though not sure how good the investment side of it is as I invest in different funds. Investment preference is entirely down to personal choice/circumstances though and I would recommend you read the fund factsheet to decide if that's how you would like to invest your pension (which is going to be for &gt;30y).",0,1393191152,null,0,false,0,cfmtjfl,t3_1ymw0e,t1_cfmtjfl,t1_cfmna2n,null,1432527019,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

&gt; The problem today was that Norwich came out with the same plan to beat us as Dnipro had

This is correct, it was them coming at us which was the problem but that is born of a poor performance from us.

&gt; Bentalbe was poor (3rd or 4th game running, depending on how you feel he did against Newcastle) and yet he continues to start
 
Same with Capoue (and Paulinho was crap today too), but with Sandro and Siggy out and Holtby on loan there aren't that many options to mix it up with.

&gt;  Paulinho was NOT the correct player to bring off today, at all.

completely ineffective, rarely got on the ball and when he did created little of note. Lost the ball a lot. He was a passenger, made total sense to remove him (though one could argue Eriksen may've been the right man to replace him).

&gt; The bottom line is this; we've mostly gotten lucky under Sherwood; against Newcastle, we had 2 rebounds fall straight into Adebayor's lap and then Chadli hit a beauty of a curler after they'd given up. Against Everton, we were lucky not to be beaten 4 or 5 to nil, except Lloris saved our asses and Walker/Adebayor caught Everton sleeping and got lucky.

We've been lucky all season, remember vs Fulham, and vs Sunderland under AVB (the bottom two teams mightn't I add), and so what did you expect from his replacement who was the only person we could get for the job? From this I continue my thought of why say Sherwood out? when you know this is what would happen and it's the kind of thing that does happen with football.

&gt; I think today was far more representative of Sherwood's reign than any other game.

The game that would be representative of Sherwood's reign would be the average game, the average Sherwood performance and the average Sherwood result. This game was neither so can't be considered that. Maybe if he goes on a super shit run for a bit it will become the average Sherwood performance but you can't call it that now.",0,1393191271,null,0,false,0,cfmtlav,t3_1ypug4,t1_cfmtlav,t1_cfmt0rr,null,1432527044,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Our attack was completely headless and unmotivated. I think the lineup I posted is much more balanced and has a better chance of ""unlocking"" defenses and creating genuine chances.

Chadli was our best player in the Ukraine and very recently scored a beautiful goal that to me indicated his early season confidence is returning. If he can hit that form again (which I think he will), he's a better winger for me than Lennon, who, despite putting it some pretty consistent performances this season, is in my opinion our most limited attacking player.

Plus, I find that Paulinho has put in his best shifts for the team when he's gotten the least defensive responsibility of the midfield trio. I also think Paul is a player on the cusp of hitting his stride.

Matter of fact i felt against a team like Norwich (who you would have thought would try to sit back and defend) i would have thought that Small Paul would have been the best choice to be on the bench.

before the match i was wondering why we weren't going with Capoue deep, Bentaleb as the midfield metronome and then Erkisen as a creator and Dembele over on the wing (and switching with Eriksen), it seems like it would have given us more attacking options.  

When Capoue went down i had no issue with Chadli coming on (and thought he played alright if nothing spectacular) i thought the switch of Eriksen for Paulinho (who was ineffective) seemed the smart choice. Again didn't happen.

My only question with Bentaleb is that with all the talk of rotation Bentaleb has played virtually every minute since his introduction to the starting lineup.  Granted we have some injuries, but we are also in that area where we don't want to burn out the young kid as we approach the most important stretch of the season and today both Bentaleb and Paulinho looked a bit sluggish (to be fair so did the back line) as if the minutes from midweek had caught up a bit.

That's because he was on the ball less.

&gt; And yes, we've certainly been riding our luck all year, but under AVB I saw signs of growth and change, I saw us developing into a better team with better players.

Firstly, our players that we've gotten in have been better year after year, this hasn't been something exclusive to AVB, it's just cashmonies and Levy with that money (it's been pretty independent of managers our quality signings). Secondly it's nice you saw that (us developing into a better team under AVB) but few did including our chairman and including me and lots of spurs fans. I'm not saying he shouldn't have been given time but the concensus was that there weren't many signs of growth or change (same stuff week in week out).

&gt; I don't see that under Sherwood. With the exception of Adebayor, who is still really the same player he always was, not one player is better now than they were when AVB was sacked.

Ade's a pretty big one, and I'd say that Chadli's got a bit better and Eriksen's best form has been under Sherwood.

With Bentaleb it was purely that he was playing the DM role and he can be a bit fragile in that position but his role wasn't to contribute to attack (which Paul didn't do). He wasn't caught in posession that often and granted it was for the goal but he needed more help from his partners and with Paulinho offering little as an option and Dembele in a mood he was having to do more than he should.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"No, I won't cut him some slack. He's not a ""last minute"" guy; he's not an interim manager. He made sure Levy knew that he wanted to be tied down with a real contract and be our actual manager. Now that he's gotten that, he needs to be treated as our manager. Full Stop. If it wouldn't fly with anyone else (and it wouldn't) then it shouldn't fly with Sherwood.

WRT Paulinho; no, he wasn't on the ball as much, because we couldn't get him the ball. Bentaleb gave the ball away more because Norwich focused on jumping him every time he was in possession, which is part of why he shouldn't have been on the field.

In terms of development, my point is that under AVB, we had a direction, and I saw individual players developing; Defoe especially became a more complete player, Bale flourished (before we sold him), Dawson was able to improve and win back his place in the team, and numerous other players developed their game and got better. Under Sherwood, we have no direction. He started off playing 4-4-2, then switched to 4-4-1-1, now he's onto some crazy 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 with Dembele as a wide player, which he isn't.

Moreover, I'm seeing players who don't look like they care, and frankly, I can't blame them. Today, Sherwood, with 2 healthy wide players on the bench, played Dembele out of position so that he could play Nabil in the middle of the park, with Eriksen, Chadli, and Townsend all sitting on the bench. I honestly think that Sherwood's lost the dressing room, and it doesn't surprise me, because he's playing a 19 year old who hadn't even made the squad for a league game previously over the Danish Player of the Year, one of England's brightest prospects, and a seasoned international winger. If they can't get on the field no matter how they're doing in training and games (this is especially baffling with regards to Eriksen), but Nabil gets every minute of football available, no wonder the team doesn't care to listen to the man.

Did you change your mind about it after finding out it was a left wing argument?  Or do you still agree with it?  Left wing positions have _always, always_ been slandered.

&gt;If one of the great 20th century libertarians uttered the exact same words, the condemnation would have been fierce.

Do you mean one of the pseudo pro-corporate ""libertarians"" from the US? Or some genuine modern anarchist?

&gt;The libertarian would have been accused of ""Heartlessness"" and ""callousness"", and of having a severe lack of ""empathy"" because of his ""inherent selfishness"". Because, after all, socialists ""care"" about the poor, and those ""nasty"" libertarians only ""care"" about the rich.

Nope, not really, Statists on both sides of the debate might have made such appeals to emotions, but socialists and specifically libertarian socialists would only have focused on precisely _what_ the critique of charity was based on.  Most rightist libertarians merely want to stop the State 'wasting' money on the poor and alleviating the worst excesses of capitalism, they still want the State to 'do' capitalism, i.e to promote and protect corporate interests and to defend private property, real (leftist) libertarians seek to eliminate the State in order to eliminate capitalism and private property entirely.

Not in the slightest. I've archived it, alongside many brilliant libertarian/capitalist quotes. I will use it often when arguing against the notion that fostering dependancy can ever be regarded as a 'solution'.

&gt; Do you mean one of the pseudo pro-corporate ""libertarians"" from the US? Or some genuine modern anarchist?

Does it matter? Leftists will very often conflate the two. If anything, they see the Marco Rubio/Ted Cruz brand of libertarianism as 'better' than the Rothbardian brand - at least they're not advocating ""crazed anarchy"".

&gt; Most rightist libertarians merely want to stop the State 'wasting' money on the poor and alleviating the worst excesses of capitalism, They still want the State to 'do' capitalism, i.e to promote and protect corporate interests

It appears you are fundamentally not much different to the leftists I was caricaturing. I would vehemently dispute your notion that ""most rightist libertarians"", libertarians who in fact *don't* constitute a small handful of elitist snobs in Washington, want to *specifically* stop ""'wasting'"" money on the poor, or to appease corporate interests. I would say ""most"" libertarians are of the Ron Paul variety, with a burning desire for liberty in large part because that liberty would massively benefit the poor.

&gt; real (leftist) libertarians seek to eliminate the State in order to eliminate capitalism and private property entirely.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;You don't see Everton fans calling for their manager's head after every loss and neither should we.

No, but Everton had 10 years of David Moyes's mediocrity, and they know that like Moyes, Roberto Martinez is probably in it for the long haul, be it 3 or 10 years. 

We got robbed by Chelsea , but also tasted tangible CL success under Redknapp, we got to the quarterfinals, that's the difference. That side from four years back has, and should, set the standards for where we should be long term. This has gone through such a massive rise in the last ten years that it's only logical to see our next target as fourth place. 

Looking at your comparison of Everton, look at how many times they've been sixth and seventh, combined that's how many times we've been fourth. We're not ""solidly midtable"" like them. We're always on the cusp of that CL spot, usually by a tiny number of points. 

I'm not going to get on the Sherwood Out bandwagon, particularly because I want him to stick around in an assistant role when LvG comes in, enhance his trade a bit more, and when LvG retires off into the sunset after a couple of years, I want to what he makes of an Ajax-Tottenham playing DNA.

Sherwood isn't the best short term option, I agree, but him leaving the club is a major blow for our coming years, when he's matured enough under LvG to be a proper manager as opposed to a baptism by fire he's faced this time around.

What baffles me the most is how ponderous our passing game is.  If I were coach, I'd be doing nothing but one-touch rondos with them, week in, week out.  Every time someone gets the ball, they take too many touches, look around, see absolutely bugger all on, and then just pass it backwards or sideways.  We are utterly stagnant.

I agree that our squad is not nearly as good as people first suspected, but basics like passing and movement are things I used to get taught as a 12 year old.  Bloody Norwich had more penetration than us... so it can't be down to the players.  It's the way they're coached and instructed.

Sherwood has done about as well as he can to be honest, so it's not entirely his fault.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; Finally, it seems there are a lot of people whose expectation for the club are too high.

I partially agree with this point.  In that going into this season the expectations were certainly far too high, people were talking about us being a dark horse challenger for the title.

But at the same point we are a team that has finished 4th, 5th, 4th and 5th (with club record points) over the past 4 seasons and are currently sitting in 5th this season.  Saying that the expectation for us to qualify for a CL slot is above expectations is simply false, the fan base, the club, the players should all expect to be in a CL slot.  Any other team with that run of performance would expect the same.

The way i see it is this....'Arry got us to the CL, and love him or hate him when he was sacked most people agreed that he probably wasn't the manager to lift us to the next level.  Good Ole 'Arry was never going to be the guy who guided us past Fergie, Wenger, Pelligrini or Mou...we would scrap with the Moyes, Martinez and Rodgers of the PL and some seasons come out on top and other seasons we wouldn't. With Harry it seemed we would perpetually be the team just on the cusp of something special. So we moved for AVB, the young promising european manager. That wasn't working and (rightly or wrongly) we made the move away from him.

So now we have Sherwood as a manager.  I don't think Tim is as bad as people make him out to be.  I just don't think (at this very early point in his career) he is good enough to lift us up. To me, Tim is.....an average manager at this point. He gets it right sometimes and wrong other times and that is fine for some teams and down the line he may be brillant but at the moment he just isn't.  

For Spurs to be more than a perpetual 5th place team we need someone special to come in and inject just a bit more into the club. Maybe that is LvG, maybe it is Prandelli maybe it is someone else....but from what i have seen, it just doesn't seem to be Tim.
