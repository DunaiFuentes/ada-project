I'm incredibly happy with what just arrived from AliExpress. The quality is awesome for a shirt that only cost $15. Shipping took about 3 weeks to the day. Here are some thoughts...

-shirt material is not the same kind of ""dri-fit"" as authentic jerseys, but is really good. I can only tell because I have an authentic shirt to compare it with.

-embroidery and patches are GREAT. Indistinguishable from authentic shirt.

-I'm 6""2, 185 lbs; pretty lanky. Got the ""player version"". I normally wear a large. The authentic shirt I own is a large and it's pretty loose on me. This shirt from AliExpress is an XL, and fits GREAT. My only hangup is that the sleeves are REALLY wide and loose compared to the rest of the shirt; its a bit odd. But, my wife is going to hem them and fix them.

-The ""Etihad"" logo on the front is slightly angled, but only if you inspect closely.

-The seller/store I bought from is Ms. Linda. She was incredibly responsive when I would contact her and helpful with info.

I am certainly getting my shirts from AliExpress from now on. I'll probably always get one authentic shirt every year to support the team, but there's just no way I can not choose spending $15 for a GREAT shirt compared to $90 for one that essentially looks, fits, and feels the same.

Hope this was helpful! Here are some photos...

There are two speeds which an ISP (Internet Service Provider) measures:

1. Synchronisation Speed
2. Throughput speed

Imagine that your connection to the internet is a drain pipe. This drain pipe can take a maximum of x-liters/gallons of water (measurement of your choice) per second through it. If the water at the other end of the pipe is held back by something and it can only trickle through very slowly its not reaching the maximum capacity of the pipe.

Sync speed = Pipe
Throughput Speed = Water

Your router may be in-sync as we call it at 4.7Mbps, however your actual throughput speed will be less than that, dependent upon (among other things) the technology type you are connected to (IP Stream, WBC, FTTC, LLU etc).

To address your main point - unless you tell someone about a problem, how do you expect them to know about it? Consumer Broadband products are rarely if ever proactively monitored and so there is no way for Sky to know you are having slow speeds - other than their 12 day history.

Answered in my posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2ly0un/bbc_under_pressure_to_rethink_tv_election_debates/clzbmky) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2ly0un/bbc_under_pressure_to_rethink_tv_election_debates/clzbi3g). 

General elections are parliamentary elections, not presidential ones. Regardless of an individuals motivations for voting for a particular candidate (which often will include their impressions of that candidate's party leader), they are still voting in a parliamentary election and the TV debates should reflect that.

&gt; *And the smaller parties in Wales and Scotland will never hold significant power in Westminster, so what's the problem here? There is no reason for them to talk about UK wide issues in a UK wide debate as they will never be in a position to act on them.*

I wouldn't be so sure that the nationalist parties will never be in a position of power at Westminster. Current polling suggests that such an assumption could be blown away at the next election. Three full scale Scottish polls on voting intention have been conducted since the referendum, each showing an enormous lead for the SNP. The first, and also the most extreme, [had Labour on 23% and the SNP on 52%](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9039). This was swiftly followed by a Yougov poll which [had Labour on 27% and the SNP on 43%](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9040). Finally came a Panelbase poll, which seems to have gone unreported except on pro-independence blogs, which [had Labour on 28% and the SNP on 45%](http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/a-third-full-scale-poll-shows-snp-with.html).

With these sorts of figures, uniform swing predictors have the SNP taking the lion's share of Scottish seats. [More sophisticated forecasts](http://www.ukelect.co.uk/HTML/forecasts.html) show much the same thing, predicting that the SNP will command the third largest parliamentary group after the next election - and the only group that could make up the numbers with Labour to form a majority government. The SNP look anything but an irrelevance in Westminster politics right now.

Regardless, the ""problem"" is that it creates the impression that the policies of the UK government in areas such as health and education bear relevance to Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish voters. 

&gt; *And they'll presumably get their own debate. Again, there's no reason to put the DUP leader on the same stage as Cameron to be shown to all 63 million people. I can't and will never be able to vote for the DUP, along with most of the UK, so couldn't give a toss what they have to say.*

And those 1.5 million people in Northern Ireland will never have a chance to vote for any one of the parties involved in the debates other than the Conservatives. Why should the debates even be aired in Northern Ireland?

&gt; *Why ""England""? It's not one unified bloc where all 53 million people agree with each other. Are the regions of England less deserving of their own debates?*

Of course it isn't. But what England does have is:

* One discrete set of parties vying for votes in elections. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland differ from England in that respect to varying degrees. 

* A political system where most domestic issues are handled by central government (London itself excepted to a degree).

Making debates for the whole country viable. 

&gt; *But that's no reason to include small single-country parties in a national debate.*

Danny's continued insistence on the Doctor being an officer, and the implication that Clara and the Doctor have an abusive relationship was uncomfortable to say the least.  Its pretty clear that he had problems seeing past his own experiences in the army, he was too quick to judge the Doctor, too quick to see Clara as a fellow soldier.  I think he had a bit of a hero complex - he wanted Clara to be honest with him so that he could save her, not because he actually cared about her lying to him (if he did he would have broken up with her).  He didn't stop to consider that Clara didn't need to be saved, or that she didn't want to be saved.  Danny didn't see how much the Doctor cares about Clara or the lengths he would go to for her, Danny just saw the Doctor bossing her around.

As you say though, the super fans are doing my head in. 

Why can't  the club buy proven quality? 
Seemingly we are in for those players but fail to get them - it's  obviously more than not being a London club. There is a problem in how we conduct our transfer business. 

Why did we sign so many flops? Who takes responsibility? Outside Studge and Couts,  who have the club signed, under the current manager, that have been successes?
We can't judge any of this summer's  signings yet. Some have shown some positive signs but time will tell. So many players have been terrible buys. 

Even the likes of Sahko, who has yet to make any claim for a place in a defence which shouldn't be too hard to get into, cost 16-18 million. Lovren 20 million and looks a shadow of his former self. Migs never looked the right keeper for us and has proven to be unable to cope at our club.

Yes you can answer back that Migs has had some decent performances of late. Though really? Has he not just performed to a basic standard and even then his distribution is awful and he still isn't  commanding his area.

We all knew Suarez could go in the summer, surely the club should have had contigency plans in place to get in some top quality replacements.

Instead, except for Balo, it seems we just signed the players we were going for with Suarez staying. Then a last minute punt on Balotelli.

The club has many underlying issues that were covered up by a world class striker having a career best season and the belief that gave to the rest of the squad.

The problems we have now, were there previously. The manager has to take some of the criticism but the problems go much further than him - to the transfer commitee and the very structure of our club.

false,Rippsy,null,null,"&gt;It is untrue because many employers cannot fill NMW level jobs because the cost benefit ratio of working 40 hours a week in a job you don't like isn't sufficiently more rewarding than working 0 hours a week and getting only state benefits.

Bullshit.  The system penalizes you for working in NMW jobs by providing no job security (zero hour contracts, easy termination and easy to replace)  It's easy to end up worse off in a NMW job than being on benefits - this simply should not be true, but the answer is not to make benefits WORSE.  Why the race to the bottom.  People on benefits (and WORKING people) are already using food banks en-mass to stop starving.  

How low do you want to go?

I don't know a single person who would rather be on benefits than work for a LIVING.  Not I said living, not a wage.  Paying someone a wage which leaves them in poverty is the problem here.  Again, we're back to working poor vs benefits poor.  Or starve - or maybe we should add the other option - Jail.  which costs the tax payer more per capita than benefits.

&gt;It isn't possible to make the jobs more economically viable by raising minimum wage, particularly in areas like farming, as the jobs will either cease to exist or be off-shored. 

I agree - to a point - if the jobs are profitable and needed they should be paid a living wage.  

If the jobs are not profitable then they should not exist. 

If they need to exist the market needs to adjust to reflect the fact society cannot function with out these jobs.  If this cannot be done profitably then a state system which provides the employment must exist to fill the gap.

&gt; This strongly implies that the level of state benefit is too high.

I disagree; it implies getting off benefits is basically impossible unless you are able to land one of the very few jobs paying well which suddenly catapults you out of poverty.  You know, those jobs which are growing on job tree's in job land.

&gt;Reducing the benefits of the alternatives to NMW work is one option

See above.

&gt;but personally I'd prefer to see NMW abolished so that employers have to compete for labour rather than NMW acting as a wage ceiling 
for unskilled work as it does for the most part now.

Because other countries with no NMW are such beacons of capital delight?  If you removed the minimum wage in the UK you may as well just re-instate work houses.   The market is already adjusting down to remove all the rights workers have and reduce any type of actual requirement to be decent employers.  Can't see how removing pretty much the last bastion of civility we provide could possibly hurt them more right?  That would just end up with MORE people on welfare since the jobs that do exist leave them worse off than being on welfare.

If you both remove welfare and reduce minimum wage then you literally kill people at worst, and at best turn them to crime to survive.

Which costs your businesses and tax payers more in related costs.

&gt; Obviously this would mean that there would be some jobs offering less than current NMW salaries, but these jobs would remain unfilled if the work wasn't sufficiently rewarding as we are currently seeing.

We already have this problem, reducing NMW will not make this work magically more 'sufficiently rewarding'",0,1415714358,null,0,false,0,clzd7a4,t3_2ly9mb,t1_clzd7a4,t1_clzctyo,null,1426080367,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I'm just contrasting 'its' integration and alignment with the UK, and indeed the west, against that of Islam ... and it's not unreasonable to use available examples and fact to achieve this end vis a vis the state religion of CoE. It would be absurd not to! How would invoking a minor Christian church ... like Dominionism, assist with the conversation? Catholism would be as easier example and they're open to accusations of anti-western values ... but the UK's state religion is CoE, so it's generally unproductive. We're discussing the UK, not post Franco Spain.

Were I using CoE's integration with parliament as some yard stick of success contrasting against the House of Saud and Wahhabisim, I would concede the conceit ... but I'm not, so I reject your criticism. I will use the tools available.

It's hardly my fault that the available examples support the point being made! Purposefully seeking out fringe opinions within Christianity to demonstrate that it too is capable of madness, to somehow demonstrate unbias argument is unnecessarily theoretical, and not, in itself, suddenly more valid nor reasonable. Implying otherwise is just arguing for the sake of arguing.

Obviously, there are sects within the umbrella of Christianity that hold 'anti-western' / regressive values, but, again, I'm not offering judgement of them, nor indeed of it's implications to Christianity, or indeed religion, in a broader sense. I'm asking where OP draws a line between Islam, and between this 'other' Islam ... what exactly is the difference? 

In the CoE the difference is very clear, and the mechanics of resolution are also very clear - the separation of religion and State is in its charter, and in the House. This isn't the 'choosing' of Christianity, of-course, it's the dictation of government and a condition of it being recognised and lawful - there's no contradiction here for Christianity as a rule ... regardless of funding or influence or values or population ... Can Islam say the same?

OP maintains that Islam is compatible with western values but the conflict being described here, is the fault of this 'other'. I disagree - I would argue that, so long as the gender, orientation, race, religion ... etc, discrimation ... [sharia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia#Compatibility_with_democracy) in a word, exists, as a defining aspect of Islam (or of any religion for that matter) an impassable conflict with democracy, and so the ideals of the west, is present.

All of this is obviously open to discussion and to debate - it's enormously complicated, and I'm guilty of a few sweeping generalisations. So it goes... (though I'd otherwise apologise).

false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Bullshit. The system penalizes you for working in NMW jobs by providing no job security (zero hour contracts, easy termination and easy to replace)

Part of the problem is excessive worker protection legislation. Termination is anything but easy once an employee has been in post for six months and it is precisely because of increased worker protection that we've seen increased temp work, zero hour contracts and other loopholes. This isn't a chicken and egg argument, it is cause and effect.

&gt; It's easy to end up worse off in a NMW job than being on benefits - this simply should not be true, but the answer is not to make benefits WORSE. Why the race to the bottom.

In an ideal world, sure. The reality is that NMW work isn't attractive and excessive efforts to increase worker security and conditions have had the opposite effect (as anyone on the right of the political spectrum could have told you). It isn't a race to the bottom it's a situation where unskilled work is less attractive than a life on benefits and unless the Tories win a major majority at the next election AND the EU reforms working practices to create more jobs nothing is going to change. 

&gt; Paying someone a wage which leaves them in poverty is the problem here.

Some jobs only warrant low pay. These jobs are extremely useful for those intending to work part-time or to supplement a breadwinner's income but they aren't intended to be a living wage and only a moron would try to make them so. 

&gt; I agree - to a point - if the jobs are profitable and needed they should be paid a living wage. 

If all jobs paid a living wage there would be a lot fewer jobs. Besides, again my previous paragraph makes the point about the need for supplemental income employment opportunities.

&gt; If this cannot be done profitably then a state system which provides the employment must exist to fill the gap.

Government spending is already massively higher than we can afford and we've had to [borrow more than we can afford](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/334/uk-economy/uk-national-debt/) to meet the shortfall. It might be a nice idea in principle but this is an unrealistic pipe dream that would destroy the UK economy.

&gt; it implies getting off benefits is basically impossible unless you are able to land one of the very few jobs paying well which suddenly catapults you out of poverty.

This is a bottom up rather than a top down way of looking at the issue but it amounts to the same thing; unskilled work doesn't pay. Unfortunately for the unskilled, the only way to fix this problem is to reduce benefits for those who don't work.

&gt; If you removed the minimum wage in the UK you may as well just re-instate work houses.

That's a very naive way of looking at the issue. Market forces affect wages too where there is no minimum wage. There would be more jobs and reduced unemployment as well as (potentially) cheaper products and services available.

&gt; The market is already adjusting down to remove all the rights workers have and reduce any type of actual requirement to be decent employers.

This is the opposite of what is actually happening in reality as I've already explained with regards to excessive worker protections causing employers to look for loopholes. Ironically reducing workers rights would provide more employment and better job stability. 

&gt; If you both remove welfare and reduce minimum wage then you literally kill people at worst, and at best turn them to crime to survive.

You ignore the fact that doing so creates more jobs and more incentive for people to work in those jobs leading to reduced overall poverty and unemployment.

&gt; We already have this problem, reducing NMW will not make this work magically more 'sufficiently rewarding'

No, but it will make employers have to compete against one another for staff, pushing up salaries in less attractive work.",0,1415715520,null,0,false,0,clzdm0f,t3_2ly9mb,t1_clzdm0f,t1_clzd7a4,null,1426080177,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

We have: 

* a stellar, fit LB who can offer a lot going forward on the overlap and incisively through the inner left channel (as we saw v Madrid) 
* a young RB with a reliable and solid cross, and good defensive nous
* a traditional DM who can break up play and has bags of experience doing so. 
* a fast, strong, skillful winger who is most dangerous with space to run into on the flanks, or for deep defensive setups, effective when running off a striker through the middle
* two excellent dribblers, who can penetrate midfields in a few quick touches - one who can pick a pass as well, the other who has a goalscoring touch
* two slower forwards, one with an excellent presence in the box, and the other who links up superbly with the midfield - both with very good goalscoring records last season at two differently styled clubs
* FOUR central defenders with lots of experience and ability, who need some more protection in midfield and FBs with a bit more direction
* three midfielders with ball retention and box-to-box running, though lacking quality in the final third 
* a very good shot-stopper with woeful levels of concentration 
* daniel sturridge

&gt;The truth is that Britain’s housing crisis is almost entirely about the use of land, which is determined largely by planning policy. A hectare of agricultural land on the edge of Oxford may cost £6,000-£10,000. Similar land with planning permission can be worth £4 million. That huge gap is what encourages land speculation, and so creates many of the problems Mr Spiers raises about the state of the building industry.

&gt;Since only a small amount of developable land is released each year by councils, developers compete entirely at the point when they are buying land, rather than at the point when they are selling the homes they build.

false,rzam,lfc68,,"I genuinely believe the system -- and the defensive midfield setup, in particular -- has a lot to do with it. Yes, Kolo looked great in Madrid last week, but he had Lucas Leiva in front of him. Look how solid Chelsea are with a world-class DM in Matic shielding a 34 y/o John Terry. Southampton have allowed 5 goals all season -- no, they haven't made a defensive error all season, but they're also starting a CB who couldn't break into Atletico's backline last season and they have disciplined central midfielders (Schneiderlin, Wanyama, Cork) who work hard and have a positional mandate to protect the back four.

Look, what I mean to say is it's a Steven Gerrard issue. I love the guy -- he's my favorite player ever, if not athlete, full stop, and he's a legend at Liverpool Football Club who I hope stays with us as long as humanly possible -- but the issue has always been how to keep his quality and set piece delivery on the field w/o compromising our solidity and shape off the ball. It's gotten to the point where, without Sturridge and Suarez providing the threat that stretches defenses and opens up space for Gerrard to operate/provide lethal service, it's simply not worth having his on-ball quality on the field. We were bleeding goals with the guy in midfield last season. We're bleeding goals again this season, only this time we're not scoring at will.

I've only recently come around to this conclusion, and it pains me to say it, but Rodgers needs to drop Gerrard -- at least so far as playing him whenever possible, as he does now. He's still the captain, and as an impact sub he can be utilized ANYWHERE in midfield, in ANY position (ideally as an central attacking midfielder), for 25-30 minutes a game and NOT be a liability. But he cannot be counted on anymore when it comes to this Liverpool team -- w/o Suarez and on pace to score something like 50 goals this season -- conceding soft goals and allowing opponents space to exploit. It's not doing Lovren or any of our defenders any favors -- put Gerrard in for Lucas in that Madrid game and there's no way Real don't tear us up for a few more goals and make Kolo look just as ridiculous.

**TL;DR: Lucas Leiva, 27 y/o and the best defensive midfielder in the Premier League only three years ago, should be given a genuine chance / a run of games in Gerrard's position to provide our defensive the sort of midfield protection provided to other backlines -- ones that don't hemorrhage soft goals and loads of space to the opposition.**",0,1415715961,null,0,false,0,clzdrw8,t3_2lxqz9,t1_clzdrw8,t1_clz69t9,null,1426080100,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

That's not the point though. Even if you have met every one of the Muslims on your street, and every single one of them was an asshole to you, it is still not valid to conclude that Muslims in general are assholes, or that Islam causes people to become assholes. You have an insignificant sample size compared to the size of the group you are judging, and the sample is not at all representative of the breadth of the group since it entirely localised.

the second thing to note is that there is no 'muslim culture' any more than there is a 'Christian culture' or 'Chinese culture' or 'African culture'.  They're all sets that include millions of people with very nearly nothing culturally in common.  The individuals shouting at you in the streets are, as you not, 'not all muslims', but they're also not even representative of any significant number.  it's just that the muslim people you'd probably like, who's culture is fascinating and rich and keeps alive the incredible humanities of the Islamic Renesaince are harder to notice because they don't shout about it on the streets.  Like most other people they keep themselves to themselves.       
      
lastly, I'll note that being left wing has really nothing intrinsically to do with liberalism or tolerance.  the terms were used to refer to political views on a spectrum of (basically) individualist to communitarian.  They get used more broadly these days to mean really nothing very specific.  Being very communitarian doens't mean you have to be tolerant of x, y, or z.  In fact, I'd argue that tolerance is not a good thing in itself - you don't 'tolerate' something you make no value judgements on, you only tolerate those things you have judged ill but don't act on those judgements.  In most cases I find the right thing to do is not make judgements (because in most cases the chances of me knowing enough to make an informed judgement are nil).

&gt; First mention of quantitative easing in this discussion between you and me - I understand it perfectly and it's a made-up term by Gordon Brown ....

The statement is from Brand's book it's an example of how he talks - it's known in the trade as gibberish. You're here defending that stament and pretending to know what it means.

Professor Chandran Kukathas, the chair of political theory at the London School of Economics, who said he is “very sympathetic to anarchists” but is “sorry to say Brand’s manifesto as it’s been reported is utterly incoherent”. He read Brands book and has this to say:

&gt; “Cancelling personal debt would stimulate the economy more than any ‘too big to fail’ bank quantitative easing.” - Mr Brand is quite confused when he refers to ‘“too big to fail” bank quantitative easing’. Quantitative easing is neither necessary nor sufficient for stopping a bank or any other corporation from failing.

And so there it is. I'm sure all this easily confuses you - you read ""lazy thinking"" as ""dole-scrounger"" which would make any discussion difficult, but please do calm down darling.

false,lommym,num11,,"Okay, I could see a few levels of this happening.  

First level: Everything Must Go!

Out: Adebayor, Soldado, Lennon, Paulinho, Dembélé, Vertonghen, Chiricheș, BAE

In: 2x Striker, 1x wide player (J-Rod possibly), 1x central midfield player,  1x CB 

Note: This is unlikely, as it is way too much movement for one month.  

---

Second level: Clearance Rack

Out: Adebayor OR Soldado (not both), Paulinho and/or Dembélé, Chiricheș, BAE

In: 1x striker, 1 central player if we sold both Paulinho and Dembélé

Note: Also, unlikely... I mean, realistically, these are all unlikely as I'm just guessing and real life can play out in any fashion. 

---
 Third level: Little Movement

Out: Lennon or Townsend, Paulinho, BAE 

In: J-Rod

Note: Who knows? I certainly don't. 

---
My main thoughts are:

* We could be looking to ship out a striker or two, pending on replacements and the value that Ade or Soldado still hold
* A wide player could be leaving, but Poch seems to like the depth for cup matches
* Dembélé has not been used much at all, and Paulinho has been used even less... it seems likely that one of them would be out the door.
* I'm not sure how Poch feels about the RB situation... as we would could potentially have 3 players there come January.  I think it depends on how he feels Naughton can perform.
* Berahino is the name on everyone's lips, but I think it is unlikely he'll end up at Spurs anytime soon.  I still like Benteke a lot (a lot, a lot), but he'll still cost a pretty penny and he may have a poor taste in his mouth from that last match.  I have a theory on a top striker that we may try to court, but I don't want to speak of it and jinx it.  
* EDIT: I only write J-Rod a few times, because I know we've been linked with him.  I have no feelings positive, or negative, toward that deal... unless of course he is wildly expensive, and then I am wildly against it.

The only way to fix this would be instead to base figures on actual real world testing. Which then introduces a level of variability in the figures which may or may not be ideal.",0,1415718038,null,0,false,0,clzeln2,t3_2lysir,t1_clzeln2,t3_2lysir,null,1426079715,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I'd recommend banning/flagging the ones below for a while to see if it has any discernible effect on the sub for a few weeks (especially leading up to January) and before making a decision whether to continue or not.

A stickied thread can indicate the new list of unacceptable sources and what to do if someone wants to discuss a transfer rumour (in or out) - either make it a general positional discussion (Goalkeepers, Right-Backs), or a player-specific one (Handanovic, Glen Johnson). They can then paste the (relevant) article text in as a comment rather than link the article itself.

In any case, my suggested list is:

It wouldn't which was the point I was making. Conflating the two simply because they share the same basic faith was be rediclous and yet you seem to be insisting that we treat Islam monolithically. It seems to be one rule for the faith you like and one rule for the faith you don't.

That a loaded question and has nothing to do with what they were saying.

It's important to remember that he hasn't been 'banned' or 'censored': people complained and the broadcaster decided that, rather than annoy all of the people who complained, they shouldn't show it after all.

That's how things work. If thousands of people had sent messages or signed petitions asking for it to be shown then maybe they wouldn't have decided to drop it, but they did. I think it's broadly analogous to disallowing the use of racist language in comedy and other publicly available media - I don't think anyone would be complaining if a comedian who spoke about and basically encouraged white supremacist ideology was dropped from the schedule.

It's just too simplistic for me and feels dated and self conscious and ineffective, a sort of ""yeah thanks captain obvious"" exercise of pointlessness 

It must have been 2003 when section 28 was repealed they had some guy come in and talk for a few minutes (in an I.T. lesson of all things, what?) and I swear all I took away from that talk was ""2 people in this class will be gay and that's okay! bye then!"" and it was fine in theory, but when me and my pal left the lesson we were both like ""gee, I hope I'm not gay!"" - uh oh! it's just not enough to be effective in overriding other influences 

So it's good to see they're putting their foot down on this issue and trying, but the execution of the policy is just not effective or appropriate for me, and for gods sake when a bunch of parents who are religious or paranoid or ignorant about sexuality and grew up in the 50s are accusing you of ""grooming"" their ""impressionable"" kids why would they have these bizarre vague story books and chanting of ""is that okay?"" ""yes!"" and play right into their paranoid delusional fantasies? LOL

They freak the fuck *out* about homosexuality, but I've always thought the education should take a more no-nonsense, scientific approach, like talking more about what we know about sexuality and how it works, and what the experts think at the moment, but also maintain it's a mysterious thing where there is still a lot left to be discovered, and maybe encourage people to keep up with the developments throughout their life as they happen if they want. I'd incorporate what we *do* know into all subjects it may apply like sex ed, biology, history and sociology and PSHE and explore studies and hypothesis deeper but spread it out over the course of our entire schooling period depending on what's appropriate for the time 

I think tackling homophobia and basic sex ed is absolutely appropriate for primary schools but I think the execution in secondary schools is seriously lacklustre and just not enough to override other influences and pressures I think, it needs more sustenance and modernisation and not some vague, outdated and censored 1980s textbooks or limp wristed ""be nice!!"" lip service. Good to see them putting their foot down though, but after section 28 things are still pretty tricky

I'm also fully aware that this has little to do with the OP I was chiming into your particular branch of conversation regarding colonialism and colonisation. 

The issue of arranged marriages and the importing of foreign spouses is an issue pertaining to Islamic communities (it may be a similar level amongst Bangladeshis or Somalis or Albanians but I'm less well informed on them so I prefer not to make a blanket statement when an example from the majority will suffice) that hinders social cohesion. As is the prevalence of intra community relationships which may form a broader topic of discussion on religion as an isolating factor in society if you prefer. People who are particularly devout are more likely to seek a partner with similar views which is perfectly natural. The idea of a community gated from the rest of society by its faith was factored into similar allegations of unwillingness to integrate levelled at Jews, in the decades and centuries before the arrival of large Islamic communities in Britain or the rest of Europe.

Again no one besides you is saying that it is intrinsically positive or negative.

Yeah, this stings a bit. Are we absolutely sure that all the folks who did fight and die were fighting for this? Because if we aren't, we and some misled or misguided people risk seriously disrespecting their memory, their motives and their wishes.

Truth is, all who pay tax in the UK indirectly support the troops anyway, so the idea that it's some kind of choice in the first place is ill-founded.

Maybe I'd rather support the troops a little less, and support the NHS, traffic infrastructure, education, a better manned police service, welfare, housing, etc. etc. a little more.

But this isn't quite a democracy and I only have the most fleeting influence over how tax is divvied up.

Paying tax is ok. I don't mind it at all.

I do mind how some of it is spent, and I don't want to be suspected by the government who's spending it of being anti-patriotic for not overtly supporting the cause.

Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division; for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.

And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

Well it's impossible to punish everyone who ever downloaded a song for free. You would have to imprison the majority of people under the age of 30 for a start.

It is foolish when they spend millions upon millions fighting a lost cause. They are just throwing their money away, it has zero affect on what people do.

The thing that makes it bigotry is the generalisation.  The thing that makes it racism is that in general OP's attitudes are directed against an ethnic group, but shielded under the euphemism of ""muslim"".  OP doesn't have any theological issues with islam the religion, he's unhappy about a particular group in his community.  He knows that if he identifies them by race he will be ignored as a racist, so he refers to them as ""muslims"" instead.

&gt;  and what if we say, as you put it, ""Muslims of Pakistani descent"". Are we not then 'slagging off' a whole culture? Is that racist?

No, it's not necessarilly racist.  If you're specific enough, and you're complaining about actions rather than race or racial proxies like religion, then you can have a problem with a particular group's actions without being racist about it.

I consider myself an Antitheist these days and of all the (mono)theocracies Islam seems to be least willing to show any form of progression and Muslims least willing to integrate with a wider society. 

The reasoning that I normally here is that Islam is not compatible with X or Y or Z. Well I say too bad then, because the wider secular society takes precedent over antiquated, plagiarised, man man dogma. We're far too forgiving of theocratic encroachments for the sake of being politically correct, it's about time we drew a very clear line and put and end to it all. 

Admittedly the media is having a field day with Islam at the moment and I think there's a problem of generalisation here, because I do indeed have moderate muslim friends and a lot of ex-muslims who are all wonderful people, but I think there are fundamental problems with Islam that needs to be addressed quiet urgently, and not just in the UK.

On a personal note, I'm from the Midlands myself, white and into my thirties and I've experienced (I won't use the word victim) verbal threats from Muslims when I returned home to visit family and friends. I wouldn't say I felt threatened, but it was certainly not a pleasant experience.

Wahhabism is not some minor movement, either. It's one of, if not *the*, best funded religious organisations on the planet / history. 

We can have a conversation about Christianity and safely ignore Dominicism - is this the case for Wahhabism? No.

Yes, I have formed an opinion already - why is this a bad thing? How does one even have a conversation w/o taking a position? Haven't you, equally, taken a position? How can anyone claim this as a weakness in thinking? 

Sharia Law is inherent to Islam, and Sharia runs contrary to the conditions of democracy, outside of an Islamic State. None of this is controversial, nor any of it is loaded with judgement nor ridicule. *I'm* offering no insult, unless I'm to be considered disrespectful / wrong, simply by virtue of disagreeing with *you*.

This, of-course, is a smaller, individual version of how Islam potentially threatens the west ... it's not enough for another to cease from confronting a differenting opinion (which you appear to be on the verge of), but, to allow that a differing opinion is as valid, even if it's poorly expressed (as I am doing, leaving reddit to our judge) as one's own.

Yes, and alongside them are Christian preachers (black and white), Scientologists, Hare Krishnas, and the Devil's spawn themselves, chuggers of pretty much every stripe.

Handing out leaflets and banging on about God or politics is completely normal for a city centre.

The fact that some of the people doing it are Muslims does not make the city under siege.

That's fine, but you are literally the only person with a significant posting history who agrees with him. There are a dozen other posters who have been on Reddit as long or longer than you, and lived in Birmingham as long or longer than you, who don't agree with you and who think the OP is dodgy as fuck.

But I hasten to add I'm not counting myself among them, because although my husband is from the Black Country and attended a majority-ethnic minority school for most of his education, I have only ever been a (frequent) visitor, because there is nothing that could induce me to live up there.

&gt;When said scumbags are motivated by their cultural and religous background and it's directed against me - I'm inclined to call out that culture and religion.

I've gotten a LOT of abuse up there. It's always been from white underclass scumbags. So I guess that's where I'm coming from with that.

false,Darneil,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Sorry for the story, but I always remember it around these times. When I was around 17, I went on a History A Level trip to Czech Republic as part of a World War 2 tour, looking at the sites of occupation in the Czech Republic, then various sites in Germany on the way back. But the biggest day for me was the last night of the tour.

We were with a big group of GCSE students, and they were told to bed, but the teachers let us stay out and have drinks in the hotel bar until about 11pm because it was our last day and there was maybe 10 of us helping the teachers look after 40 odd 15 year olds. I remember seeing this old man in a black suit but medals on his chest sat at the bar with a pint. 

So I sat down with him, started talking to him. One of the other guys in class I was never fond of sat down with me, and he started telling us his story. He was in the 6th Airborne, part of the landings in Arnhem, and was on his way to the place to go to the memorial service for the last time, because no one else from his unit was alive anymore (This was 5/6 years ago). He told us stories that I'm saddened to say I don't remember (I was 17, didnt understand a lot of what he said, slightly tipsy) what his story was other than he was in Holland. 

I just remember that suddenly a teacher came and tapped us on the shoulder and said ""We didn't want to send you to bed with the rest, so you go when you're done"" and lo and behold, it was almost 1am. We'd been sat with this old soldier for almost two hours just listening to him tell someone his story of the war. And I tell you the guy seemed like a massive weight was off his shoulders because two young students wanted to know what his tale was. It was heartwarming, and it's bringing a tear to my eye remembering it.

We never spoke after that. Maybe he's still alive, I like to think so, but it made me realize that you should always second guess the elederly (or even young) individuals sat around on their own. This lonely old man was on his own, a bit down, and all he wanted was company to share his story of a brutal conflict. Some of these lonely people have been through hell and back, and many will never tell their story. Always *always* try and ask, or see who they are. Soon they wont be with us anymore, and sometimes, just talking to new people, or having a drink bought for them can mean *massive amounts* to them.

I hate to say the story ended with me getting lost, very drunk, at around 3am in the hotel, and getting a special mention on the bus next morning because a teacher found me asleep in the middle of the hall. But there we go. I should also end the story with the point that ever since I've devoted huge time to studying military history, the World Wars in particular, and I wish I could speak with him again to learn more. Even going into the military myself soon, I can't understate how important it is to learn and understand what these people went through, lest we ever forget.",0,1415721477,null,0,1415721697,0,clzg6m9,t3_2ly9o8,t1_clzg6m9,t3_2ly9o8,null,1426078976,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

* Richard and Edward Benyon made statements to the residents of the New Era estate that they would sustain the social housing which was the purpose of the block originally. Having made the promise that they would act in a socially minded way they are now increasing the rent from £600 to £2000

(By the way.. having been to the estate when we protested on Saturday... these aren't luxury apartments. They are basic, blocky homes tucked behind a row of basic, blocky shops. It's not luxury living, it just happens to be in an up-and-coming part of London)

* For those that are saying ""Well - if she can't afford it she should move out"". If you live in London SHE MIGHT BE PROVIDING YOUR HEALTHCARE ONE DAY. For a workable city we need a community of all types, including people that work on the lower end of the wage scale. It's not practical for her to commute hours to work, especially with the insane rail prices. 

Those that show a hard-line attitude might also argue against Living Wage (""screw her! She should get a better job if she don't like her wages!""). Don't you want anybody to staff the jobs that you need in this city?

Supporting a pair of billionaire brothers in their endeavor to screw over local residents, whilst not supporting a living wage is so short sighted. We can't live in a city where the only residents are earning enough to pay £2,000/month in rent.

The Muslims seem to be the only people with loud speaker stereo systems, but they're not the only ones - that's true. Doesn't mean they can't be heard down both streets either, though. 

&gt; That's fine, but you are literally the only person with a significant posting history who agrees with him. There are a dozen other posters who have been on Reddit as long or longer than you, and lived in Birmingham as long or longer than you, who don't agree with you and who think the OP is dodgy as fuck.

Well you're all invited here to find out first hand. I find it amusing that this is in debate - as it's not a case of who is lying, the evidence is right here on the streets and anyone is welcome to get on a train or bus or car and come and see it and confirm it for themselves. 

I gain nothing by lying because it would be so easy to disprove - equally I speak confidently because I see it every day. 

&gt; I've gotten a LOT of abuse up there. It's always been from white underclass scumbags. So I guess that's where I'm coming from with that.

I'm sorry to hear that and can't excuse the white people - but from my point of view the existance of one doesn't negate the other. The claim here is not that white people are perfect but that *this* is tiresome and a problem. We ought to be able to recognise both as problems - just just one or the other. 

&gt; I find the notion that the OP, who is not white, has never been racially abused by a white person incredibly hard to believe.

If that's the case then I'd also find that unlikely - but again deflecting the issue on to white people doesn't change or solve the issues of unpleasant Muslim people. 

The difference seems to be we can all acknowledge the existance of unpleasant white people - I've not seen anyone deny it - but unpleasant Muslims?

Vertonghen said in an interview today that Poch wants them to build from the back, I have seen 0 evidence of that in action. Southampton last year had the second largest number of vertical balls, I have seen none of that.

The players are sporadic at best in the press but certainly quite lethal when they do retrieve the ball. I kind of feel that Eriksen/Lamela/Adebayor is the let down here (even though it was Eriksens pressing vs the scum that led to the goal). Lamela is an awful tackler (for all his enthusiasm) and is dispossessed too much, Eriksen is straight up weak defensively and Adebayor is lazy. Adebayor's lazyness is awful considering the philosophy is to 'press from the front'. When 3/4 of our front men are awful at pressing it doesn't make for pretty defending. 

As far as player vs player is concerned Chadli is filling the J-Rod role quite well and Mason is something like a MS junior. Also worth noting that Wanyama - Schneiderlin shields the back 4 far greater than Mason - (out of form) Capoue. We also have no leader like Fonte in the squad.

It is just not up to us to decide what it represents to the women who wear it and the best thing we can do is be clear that they have a right to chose which we will support fully what ever way they make it.

Whereas despite the fact that *even in Birmingham*, the overwhelming majority of Muslim people one passes in the street, and interacts with, are totally normal, polite people going about their own business (albeit in scary weird clothes like hijabs, according to OP), the fact that a tiny minority are racist assholes means that the rest of them must shoulder the blame.

I don't really blame them for doing what they do best: make big money from selling pop music. Anyone who thought pop artists would make any sort of meaningful stand on something that isn't already a vastly popular opinion is simply naive.

I do question the wisdom in the RBL using it as their ""official single"" though. But even then, I understand that their only goal is to present the soldiers of the UK as heroes to the public and galvanise support for the troops, which in itself is not a bad thing. Singing about how all those soldiers in WWI pretty much died horribly for no good reason doesn't put the troops in a particularly heroic light, so they were not particularly bothered about it being cut a bit.

I don't think there was any malicious intent in cutting the verses off.

right... so raping all those girls in Rotherham wasn't an action? Or it was an action but drawing attention to anything racially or culturally about the perpetrators is racist? And is religion *always* a racial proxy, or just in the case of OP?

&gt;...aaand we're back into straight-up racism. A tiny minority of the british pakistani community have been convicted of sex crimes,

ok... so I *can* discuss crimes that have taken place in the Muslim community, with a majority of Pakistani Muslim offenders, as long as I *don't* mention that they are Pakistani or Muslim... is that what you are saying?

&gt; and you are claiming it's representative of them as a group (you're even spreading the love further and trying to apply it to all muslims too)

Don't be so arrogant as to try and tell me my fucking opinions. 

There's a difference between saying every Muslim is a slathering rapist and pointing out that the culture propagated by those in strongly Islamic areas can be detrimental to British values and lifestyle. Sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming ""RACIST"" means that people who live with this daily are alienated. 

*That* is how racism, real racism and not this pretend one that you are desperately trying to justify, gets started. People are ignored by the main political parties and the media and end up gravitating towards the only people who treat their concerns seriously, Britain First and White Nationalists and such. 

&gt;He knows that if he identifies them by race he will be ignored as a racist, so he refers to them as ""muslims"" instead.

Generalisations are wrong but baseless assumptions are fine? I'll have to remember that.

Genuine refugees who are running from ISIS or running from a civil war and need temporary shelter that may be terminated when their country is in peace again are not a long term threat to us nor are they particularly expensive to care for. 

Now why we issued 8000 more visas to just Indian workers than the number of workers who came from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia all combined ([49,000](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/nov/14/india-eastern-europe-cameron-immigration-dilemma) to [41,000](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2014/stb-msqr-august-2014.html#tab-2--Who-is-Migrating-to-and-from-the-UK--)) when British citizens get no rights in India but every right to work and live in those European countries I don't quite know - it seems like a raw deal. Not all those 49,000 people can be highly skilled or whatever - where we have control over non-skilled immigration we should be using it. In terms of pure numbers non-EU immigration is a much bigger issue than EU immigration which is understandable considering India has population 14 times larger than those Eastern European countries combined. 

However this is still something we should approach carefully. We don't want to discourage university students from coming here as they are the most educated etc. Theresa May's 'Go Home' vans are probably not the best idea but still it's something we have total control over and can reduce provided the government is willing to piss off the governments of those countries a little bit.

As someone in England, I disagree with the idea that England is one unified voting bloc. The South West is roughly similar in population to Scotland, but it gets far less recognition than Scotland does. There will be no televised regional debate for us. But Scotland gets one, with all of the parties that Scottish voters can vote for.}

I at no point stated England was one unified as one political voting bloc. There may be regional differences but a party leader speaking about education policy, the health service etc etc will be talking about policies they will adopt across the whole of England. Until some form of English regional devolution appears that's the reality. 

They none of them have anything to say about similar matters outside of England. That's the absurdity of our current system. You appear to object to Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish reps appearing on a UK wide platform but don't seem to get that there is no UK wide platform for a substantial proportion of the issues that effect peoples daily lives.

For the English these debates are about who will run England, for those outside of England Westminster leaders are responsible for a declining proportion of how they are governed. These debates don't recognise that reality.

Sure, we've never seen that before, but maybe with the technology they're using, since the individuals are already dead, there is some issue with separating the emotions out, so you have to get them to decide or not. Sure, doesn't make a TON of sense, but it can at least be internally consistent.

The problem I have is twofold. 

1) If you are giving them a choice, SURELY you (missy) must know who has done it and who hasn't. That means at the very least (since you know it's important not to have emotions) you should NOT download them back into their cyber-body. Keep those people locked up in the afterlife (or just destroy them). See, this could have easily been explained away. Have a single 2 minute scene of everyone disappearing from the afterlife except Danny and some other holdouts. Have him do something that allows him to ""hack"" his way into his body/the real world. That way at least it shows that the whole plan wasn't stupid to begin with.

2) The device on his chest. See, if it was easy as someone else just turning it on, WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST TURN IT ON! That goes completely against what they were setting us up for (that it has to be your choice). Maybe they figured it WAS his choice at that point, but they could have made that more clear. Like, have him trying to turn it on but unable to (physically), so the Doctor has to lend him the screwdriver or something. At least then it hold some internal consistency, right?.

I don't know. I get really frustrated when there are plot holes that are super easy to fill. I mean, I get it if you've written yourself into a corner, but if it takes like 30 seconds of exposition to explain away something that is glaringly obvious to the viewer, TAKE THAT 30 SECONDS!

You've emotively talked about the 'right to be greedy'.  Whether or not the owner is actually greedy doesn't matter a jot.  When it comes to personal failings, if he is greedy, then the people who live there and expect to pay a fraction of what the place is actually worth also need to pay attention to their situation.

If it is important to you to continue living somewhere you have always lived, it's incumbent upon you to protect that, or find it less important if you cannot.  It can't be just a right that you have, simply because you find it important.  If you rent a place, you have to be real.  You might have lived in that place all your life but you must know a) you don't own it, and as a result of that b) you might have to move out at any time, or c) you might have different rent to pay.  If those are your circumstances then yes, if you have to move out and you haven't budgeted for it then it's very difficult and a pain in the ass.

If people are accustomed to paying something, why should that be important if it bears no relation to what the place is worth?  They now can't afford it.  We can say it is a shame for those people, it must be.  But people move houses all the damn time because of reduced circumstance.  Is that a shame for them?  Yes no doubt it is.  But something being a shame doesn't somehow confer rights.  It just means they need to change the way they are operating in order to continue on an even keel.

What do you suggest in this case?  That the person who buys it has to just charge what the previous landlord has charged?  If that rule was enforced this person wouldn't have bought the property, but it wasn't and he did.  He owns the property.  If he chooses to knock it down and build a kennel for corgis, then subject to planning law, it is his right.  If people want to live there then they have to make him an offer that is attractive to him, because that is the way trade with human beings works.

&gt;

&gt;__Mary Mallon__ (September 23, 1869 – November 11, 1938), better known as __Typhoid Mary__, was the first person in the United States identified as an [asymptomatic carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier) of the pathogen associated with [typhoid fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever). She was presumed to have infected 53 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook.  She was twice forcibly isolated by public health authorities and died after a total of nearly three decades in isolation.

I guess the *general* lack of empathy is because this is private housing and the rest of us have to deal with the same issues. We have to deal with landlords raising our rent. We have to deal with budgets. We have to deal with commuting in. What we don't get are flats for £640 per month, even up till 2016. What we don't get is why we should control her rents, but not ours? We provide services in this city too (perhaps not healthcare though), but if I say I want a cheap flat I have no options. If a landlord buys my place and jacks up the rent, or kicks me out (which has happened) no one was picketing outside my house, the fact is, that IS life.

Just because the guy who bought the place I was living in wasn't a billionaire (I assume) and wasn't an MP, it's fine for him to kick me out, but because this knob is a Tory I'm supposed to now be appalled?

Both Siggy and Holtby are at an age where they want to be playing full time  for the sake of their own careers.

If you look back at the summer (knowing absolutely nothing about this season as it stands) it genuinely looked like neither of them would be consistent starters for the squad.  They may see significant time but they did not look to be ""first name on the teamsheet"" material.

Well, Siggy is given a chance to go back to Swansea, he is already familiar with Monk (having played with him while at Swansea), he already knows several players, already knows the supporters, city and club....and he knows he will be able to walk into the side as a starter and likely be one of the major points of the Swans attack.  Seems a pretty good situation for him.

Holtby wanted to play, gets offered a chance to return to Germany, walk into the lineup and likely be the focal point of HSV. Again, seems a good situation for him.

To add to that, I could pay the deposit out of my overdraft, not eating for a month did always sound like fun. I could quit my job and move 100 miles back to my parents and go on the dole.. That's what society wants right?  

Forget about the £100 fee for leaving my contract early, because the landlord and agents don't care someone threatened to kill me, they'll only release me early if it's into another property owned by the same landlord.

It's not spirituality, it's law, culture, attitudes, judiciary etc etc. 

There's also the issue of a lack of central power. If you disagree with the pope you can fairly say you might not be a great Catholic. But what is a true Muslim? It's a free for all which as with many free markets can lead to the loudest and most brash gaining the upper hand. You can see the effect with the difference between the free for all christianity in America and the state church of the England.

At college the canteen was split into two, the Asian kids would stay in one half (a sectioned off Costa) and the white/black kids would stay in the other half. It was honestly mental. I still won't walk through Small Heath when it's dark just because quite frankly it's not worth the risk.

I appreciate the sacrifice that those people made and I'd like to pay my respects, but I can't give my backing to a campaign that doesn't pay any sort of attention to the concept that we should be striving to stop this from happening again. A couple of things really shocked me in this regard. One, a few years ago in someone gave a speech and in it mentioned remembrance for German soldiers as well. There was uproar. That made me feel like remembrance day was almost an extension of the war, an extension of us vs them. A total disgrace IMO. Secondly, the refusal to condemn war itself in some quarters. It's fucking morbid.

I don't really care who or what the white poppy's originators were doing politically at the time. But the concept as it is today seems to pay more respect to the memory of those who died than the main campaign. I agree it's a time for reflection and respect. I don't think there's enough of any of that in the main campaign, and that's the crux of my issue.

But wearing both seems a decent compromise to me. You can call me smug, or trying to make a political statement or score points, but none of those are true. You don't know me so you don't have to believe that, but it's the way I truly feel. I don't feel like it's possible to truly pay our respects to all the people that have died in war without committing ourselves to achieving peace. Which is probably impossible, but the fact that remembrance day doesn't seem to pay enough attention to this ideal is too much of an issue for me to back.

We have no idea whether they'd be successfully implemented here at all, or whether we'd be subject to the problems that they can cause.

At first when I looked up rent control I found many instances of it being unsatisfactory (LA, NYC).  I looked a bit further and found Germany as an example of how it might work.  The rent control system in Germany has widely been seen as successful.  So, all I can say, is I'm not qualified enough as an economist to know the impact if it was introduced in this country.  Maybe it would work.  You haven't really pointed at specifics, and if you did I wouldn't be qualified to judge them (I don't know whether you would be either, perhaps, perhaps not!)

Historically it seems to have worked for Germany.  We'd have to see whether the things that made it work for Germany also apply to the UK, and that the transition didn't cause all kinds of shit to go down.

It wouldn't be entirely without problems because it distorts the market, and that will find a way to flow past.  As well as the market distortion you'll also get the transition period which could cause difficulty.  Generally because of the market distortion I instinctively distrust it.  However who knows.  We'd have to see what, if anything, is specifically proposed, and how it goes down. 

However I can also say the same to you - look at how other countries have screwed up rent controls, instead of being for the idea by default.

There is about £90 billion in corporate tax avoidance by some measures, thats just the tax we don't collect that we should.

I also don't buy into the idea the Laffer Curve starts at 50%. I think we could have much higher taxes on the rich and big business without the apocalypse.

They'd loose the funding and support of the mainstream media however, and the cushy jobs in the private sector they waltz into. Labour develops policies to get elected and occupy positions of power that they can exploit individually, just like the other main stream parties.

I would argue the Green Party has the long term goal of simply implementing policy for the sake of the policies themselves. I would consider the Green Party a success if we didn't win a single election in my lifetime but everything in our manifesto today was adopted as policy.

The way things stand though I can't see any other party trying to implement our ideas, they are simply to corrupt.

I've started using an AHA cream (Triacnéal by Avène, with glycolic acid) in the hopes that it will get rid of my closed comedones (which are a terrible enabler of my skin picking and are causing me to obsess terribly over my skin).
I have two questions : 

1 : At which step of my PM skincare routine should I apply it, and how long should I wait until the next product? I follow a Korean style layering skincare routine with 

* double cleansing, 
* then a micellar toner or witch hazel water, 
* then Missha FT Essence, 
* then moisturizer (snail+EGF cream from Secret Key), 
* then a drop of argan oil patted on my face (I'm hoping it can create a barrier to keep the moisture in)

So far i've been applying it right after essence.

2 : Since I've started using the Triacnéal (3days ago), I wake up with small whiteheads, but no cystic pimples of painful breakouts. Obviously I've been picking them because the thought of leaving a whitehead on my face makes me go crazy with anxiety, but I try to be super gentle. Anyway. Is my skin purging?

One year in Year 2 a girl told me that she loved four members of One Direction, but not the last one ""because he's gay"".

She claimed she didn't, and I didn't tell her what it did mean because I didn't think it was appropriate. I simply said some people are gay, and that's okay. We should never make fun of people for being gay. I didn't tell her what 'gay' meant because she wouldn't have known what straight meant either. People were just people, no need to discriminate between them. 

Another time in Year 5, a group of lads told a pupil that he was gay as an insult. Again, they didn't have an idea what it meant. I took all the boys involved to one side and told them that gay people were adults of the same gender who loves each other.

false,sirtetris,flair8,,"If we're doing crazy hypothetical formations, here's an idea for a 5-4-1:

Soldado

Chadli Eriksen Mason Lamela

Rose Vertonghen Capoue Dier Walker

Lloris

Defensively, it looks like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=590c): Requires Eriksen to track back to more of an orthodox CM spot (the one question mark actually), and Capoue slips into the defensive line (where he's played before)

[In buildup:](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=58ry7) Capoue pushes up to act as a deep-lying playmaker. Mason and Eriksen help to circulate possession, Eriksen still keeping more of an eye for an incisive pass. Lamela cuts in (as he does) to look for a ball to feet and dribble, Chadli (as he does) stays high and wide and looks for diagonal runs in behind. Walker and Rose keep wide to stretch the play, as they both can threaten in attack.

[Final third](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=5907): Ideally, Walker should be threatening the fullback so Lamela can run at the left CB one-on-one, which will at least create panic. If not, Eriksen can look for runs from Chadli or Soldado (or Rose on the outside).

It really requires Capoue to be on form. But at least it forces him to stay back, which I think is a major contributor to his recent dip. Also, it kind of compartmentalizes Eriksen's and Lamela's roles (Eriksen in the left half space looking for people to make runs, Lamela in the right looking to run at the defense and create havoc) so that they don't get in each other's way.

Looks a lot like a 4-3-3 or even 4-1-4-1, maybe one of those is better.

You will need to budget for (with my personal budget numbers):
council tax (£100)
Electricity &amp; gas (£100)
water supply (£15)
water drains (£5 - some places split water up into two parts)
food (£150)
transport costs (????)
socialising
cellphone
new clothes
replacement stuff
money for a rainy day
Insurance (if you have large enough savings for a rainy day to replace everything you need to live then you can skip this)
Christmas and birthday expenses/12
Holidays/12
phoneline (?)
internet (?)

Whatever you have left if what you can spend on rent. 

You'll be able to afford to live in London on that income provided you 1) share a house 2) are careful about what you spend.

I'm genuinely curious, as someone involved in the CJ system, what do you propose for repeat shoplifters who, generally, don't have the money to pay fines and likely won't show up to work orders and probably have some form of drug/alcohol habit they don't care enough to deal with?

Shoplifting isn't a violent offence but it is disruptive and cost shops over £5 billion pounds last year ([source](http://www.retailresearch.org/ukretailcrime.php)).

That has an impact, it increases prices for everyone else, it reduces profits and margins effecting their ability to hire people and in serious cases can cause shops to shut. This is a major negative to the community.

For better or worse the threat of jail for repeat offenders does work for the ""new"" entrants to the criminal justice system, albeit the real repeaters accept this as an ""occupational hazard"" to quote Porridge. But it also allows the community a chance to exist without that person stealing their belongings and shows others that it will not be tolerated (eventually, anyway).",0,1415730161,null,0,false,0,clzkskf,t3_2lyv78,t1_clzkskf,t1_clzeur0,null,1426076755,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

**Your opinion:** An unusual jelly consistency that applies like silicone but leaves a matte finish. The -siloxanes are volatile silicones so should evaporate off. Totally reminds me of [this SANA make up base] (http://www.cominica.net/2012/04/sana-pore-putty-make-up-base-clear.html) presumably due to the oil absorbing silica. Tempted to purchase more samples as a portable make up primer!

I'm sorry but disliking it is not the same as calling it a middle finger to western values which is very clearly intended to imply that women can not wear it and support those values.

&gt;nobody is doing that are they?

I'd consider what the OP said as aggressively attacking it and there's a number of people in this comment section who come close.

&gt;i find it difficult to believe that anyone could objectively conclude that defining how women dress and how modestly they do it is anything other than culturally oppressive.

Well it's not hard to hear from many women who wear it conclude otherwise so I don't know what you want me to say? Like many things it's oppressive when enforced but it a women wants to embrace that brand of modesty why shouldn't they?

They did that - until Blair came and made the party electable again. The Greens are just a complication which split the left and make it easier for the Tories - but with the collapse of the Lib Dems it's not so much of a problem as it could have been.

Wouldn't that just make everything more expensive?

We've discussed how this video is just fear, lies and speculation without substance.

&gt;Undertake electoral reform (STV or some other more democratic system), 

It's a nice idea - but turkeys don't vote for Christmas. You saw how reluctantly they supported AV. Not that it's an excuse, I will agree FPTP has to go and ideally we keep the single-member constituencies.

&gt;abolish tuition fees

If you'll accept this means fewer university places. As someone who graduated not too long ago and has a student loan, I don't believe there is anything wrong with the student loan system, as long as they are given to anybody who has a place at a university and are charged interest in line with inflation only. A graduate tax would be tidier, but it's not a deal breaker for me at least.

&gt;stop pandering to the daily mail on immigration 

It's not just the Daily Mail. Their own voters are concerned about immigration and it's a reason Labour are losing voters to UKIP (yes, really). Does a responsible party not try to address their concerns? Labour remain incredibly weak on immigration (weak from the perspective of the voters considering UKIP).

Though obviously Austria's response to the ""rejection"" by Serbia of the ultimatum was probably unwarranted, I think Russia takes equal blame for escalating the war into Europe. Germany takes the blame for assuming attack was the best form of defence and for trying to sneak through Belgium to take France. France gets blame for antagonising Germany and Britain gets blame for the same reason.

Classic cars no, I nearly bought an old E-type back in 2007, wish I had....

The issue for me is what credit is for.  I buy my flat with a mortgage, I now have fixed costs, it's easy for me to budget.  I have enough cash set aside so I can cover rent if I am out of work for a few months.  The asset is fairly flat (or rising) in value, if I needed to sell it, I'd walk away with more cash than I started with.

Cars on the other hand no.  The thing has marginal improvement to my life over something cheaper.  If I buy outright my brand new car at £14k (DS3 eco d) I know I've got it always, it's never going to vanish, so long as I've money for insurance I'm fine.  I could have quite easily been able to get something like an M5 for that cash, with frankly minimal disturbance to my monthly outgoings as repayment.

the soldiers didn't die fighting for any 'nation' they died fighting to save the interests of the British ruling-class who use 'nationhood' to hide class-struggle and to justify the sending of millions of working-class men to death, literally thrown at death without a care. WW1 was the biggest waste of life in human history, and the idea that supporting those very ideals that created it somehow respectful to the dead is beyond me.

There's a generally accepted 'to-do' list of financial priorities to get through once you've got yourself an established income coming in.

You'll want to knock out your most expensive debts, which I assume you don't have much in the way of.

You'll want to build up an emergency fund. This is money in an easy-access bank account (or similar) that is used for disasters. This could be a broken down car, job loss, etc. Most people reckon 3-6 months of expenses is a good shout. It would suck to take out a 12 tenancy, and then get sacked or quit your job straight off.

After that you need to look at long term financial goals. Once your emergency fund is sorted, you should probably look at a pension. The rule of thumb is half your age when you start, as a percentage, to direct towards your pension. If you are 20 it's just 10%. Since most employers offer some sort of matching contribution, this could be as low as 5% from you + 5% from your employer. Get started as early as possible and you'll never miss the money (and thank yourself when you're older).

With that said, as for renting, I would avoid going straight into solo living. In most places you can get yourself a nice place with a few other people for ~£400-500 all-in. That could leave you with almost a grand each month to help launch you into better and brighter places.",0,1415732324,null,0,false,0,clzm101,t3_2lz2g1,t1_clzm101,t3_2lz2g1,null,1426076179,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

false,TheAnimus,null,null,"To be honest, I always felt that the reason we *suffered* during the credit crunch and resulting recession was because so much of our economy was built on people living lifestyles that were not sustainable without incredibly low credit.


Growing up, I'd not had money, well that's a lie, my family was comfortable until I was eight, then massively changed income, moved too etc.  So I guess that might make me tighter than some.

But anyway I was working on an equity derivs desk back when the iPhone was announced, in one of the biggest hedge funds in europe, I was enjoying my new found disposable income, and I laughed with the whole desk, *no one will buy this, £1800 is too much*.  I was a desk geek, my job was programming maths that the others struggled with.  If anyone had money for such a shiny geeky toy, I figured it would be me, I was after all top rate tax payer, yet to me the idea of spending that much money was shocking, better features could be had for £300.

People cued up round the block to buy it, I'd completely ignored credit and how people viewed it.

My analysis was spot on, no GPS, no 3rd party apps, no 3g.  It was a bit shit.  But I hadn't realised just how easy it was going to be for people to buy one, and they did.

Almost five years ago, an ex of mine contacted me, in tears begging for a loan, after looking at her finances quickly she didn't like my suggestions.  She'd managed in just 3 years of post uni life, to have amassed a debt of around 55k.  She earned less than 25k per year, she had spent it on many consumable things.  She'd never given thought to the end of a 0 percent era.  She'd been actively engaged in a game out of playing the credit tracking and scoring systems, she blamed anyone but herself for this.

People like to blame the bankers, they want to blame anyone but themselves really I guess, bankers were evil when they shorted the stocks, they were evil that they hadn't shorted the stocks. etc.  One thing was made clear to me by those people I knew outside of work, it was the fault of 'the banks' whoever that mythical beast is.

But to me it was a cultural shift that happened over the late 90s early 00s, I call it the 0 percenters.  I remember watching at uni, my bank every year would give me £500 more over draft, interest free don't you know.  People were buying things that didn't really change their life, flat screen TV to replace the old CRT, that's £1k, just put it on the never never.  This was almost a metaphor for our government at the time, spending money on consumable things today.  This is why I think we are fucked.  We won't invest money on something that has a future benefit, but we borrow to enrich our lives today.  No one likes to be told they can't have their cancer treated at 65 because we're low on money, but sadly the positive return will never be made on that investment.  That's money gone, which will be paid with interest by future generations.

When people have their society arranged by government on that principle, are acting like that individually, it's no wonder things become difficult.  People sacrifice unknown futures for a brighter today.

If you've a job where you are doing say 40k+ miles a year, then having a reliable car is probably a must, the issue is people often then use that as an excuse to spend more than they need, on credit.  The value of having a £30k job, is erm, £30k.  The value of driving there in a BMW rather than Yaris is £0.  I had a odd baptism of fire I guess, my second job out of uni, I'm playing footsie with someone who's worth hundreds of millions, I know my place, even if this current venture takes off, I'm only going to be a single digit millionaire (cry for me) but even then I doubt I'll buy a BMW**.  I'm happy with my £14k car, it's comfortable, I know I'm not rich, yet funnily out of all my *professional* friends my age, I've got the cheapest car, despite probably having the highest net worth.

My grandfather was at Singapore when it fell in 1942. He spent the rest of the war as a forced labourer in a copper mine, where he faced almost unimaginable hardship and suffering. He then came back, got married and raised a large and successful family. He's been a source of strength for me - whatever I'm going through, it's nothing compared to what he faced and overcame.

My great-uncle was in the Navy, and should have been assigned to HMS Hood. He fell badly ill, and was instead assigned to HMS Wellington (which is now moored on the Thames) after he recovered.

They don't, at least in this topic. Britain had no issue with Islamic ""extremism"" *until* we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. America's own issues came as a direct result of their foreign policy. The same applies to all of the other NATO nations who had to deal with terrorism following the invasions. 

If ""extremists"" hate democracy, personal freedom and hedonism then they'd be attacking the Netherlands most of all. The Amsterdam canals would be clogged with the tattered remains of suicide vests. Our issues with foreign fighters seeking to harm us have nothing whatsoever to do with a book, it is because of a perceived harm they feel. Whether or not that ""harm"" is valid is another debate but the point is they aren't doing this because of words on a book.

Hippie bullshit, completely ignorant of historical realities. 

Buddhists in East Asia have fought as much war as Europeans. They've had their own ethnic cleansing, genocides and massive empires won through war &amp; conquest. Their law was brutal and ruthless with horrific punishments and tortures, it's almost identical to Sharia law. They are proof positive that religious writings have little effect on culture.

The squad that Harry Redknapp inherited, see; [2008-09 Spurs Squad -Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C._season#Player_statistics) Had depth, quality and, strength in almost every position. The talisman of Ledley King anchoring the back four alongside Vedran Corluka, and Johnathan Woodgate. Internationally recognised defenders. Too much depth in MF to list, and strikers that at one stage were top scorers in the PL (looking at you Darren Bent) This squad was destined for greatness, whoever took the helm, the players had belief that came from playing well. Not from 'arry telling them to run about a bit, freezing bentley out of the squad, and comparing Bent to a lacklustre version of his mrs. The players that were then subsequently brought in in the summer of 2009 and later years see; ['Arry's boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Redknapp#Tottenham_Hotspur_.282008.E2.80.932012.29) Were a credit to levy and Redknapp working together, we had no DoF then as far as I can remember, so they were Harry's players as well as Levy's.

The stories told in the Media after the fact are difficult to read, as Harry has quite the loving relationship with tabloid writers, and levy usually stays quite quiet, so choose to believe what you will. I'm just going based on what I read around the time.

The reasons he was sacked vary, depending on who you speak to. The story I remember hearing was that it all came to a head after harry was quoted as making digs at Levy and his transfer policies, whilst Levy was at his very ill mothers's bedside, and then was coping with her subsequent passing. Poor timing from Harry, it has to be said. 

This coupled with the fact that we should never have had to rely on chelsea losing the CL and were only put in that position because we had blown a 10+ point lead over Arsenal in the latter stages of the season before he left. Again coupled with the speculation over the England job that Harry refused to come out and say he would take, or come out and refute, made him look like the bad guy. Actually, made him the bad guy.

If you underperform in the last quarter of your financial year, to the point where your company lose a massive, massive contract, and the reasons can be directly linked to your underperforming in your tasks. Your head is on the chopping block.

I don't care who you work for.

This is mainly off the top of my head. Happy to continue the conversation at a later date.

Renationalising the Railways seems like an easy one practically and politically, better than their half-way solution of allowing the public sector to bid. The only reason I can think that they aren't doing this is that the train companies, faced with losing all their contracts, would pile a huge amount of money into an anti-Labour campaign, and they already have enough enemies at the moment (the energy companies, the press etc.)

Regarding the NHS, they have already promised to undo the Health and Social Care act, essentially undoing all the pro-privatisation changes the coalition has brought in since 2010. To do more, they'd have to reverse changes they themselves made in government. Still I think they should admit they made a mistake and do this.

Regarding electoral reform, the closest they have come is having an elected senate instead of a house of lords. Hopefully the elections would use proportional representation, so at least one house would be representative. It would be a huge, and IMO positive, change to the way we run our democracy. It doesn't seem to be very popular on Reddit, most seem to prefer a technocratic house (which we don't have, and I don't think would be any improvement).

&gt; Weekly payments are proposed of £50 to children, £100 to adults and £150 to pensioners.

They suggest, though, that this would be almost entirely financed by removing personal income tax allowances:
&gt; At the moment everyone of working age pays at least 32% tax (20% income tax, 12% national insurance) on all their income above the personal tax-free allowance. In 2010/11 the top rate of income tax was 51% (50% income tax, 1% national insurance). Given that everyone would receive a tax free Citizen’s Income, personal income tax allowances would no longer be necessary.

&gt; With a basic rate of income tax of 30% on the first £5,000 of income and a top rate of income tax of 50% this Citizen’s Income policy can be expected to cost public finances under £1 billion.

&gt; An additional wealth tax on people with very large amounts of capital could be levied to help to close the wealth gap. Alternatively, a ‘super-tax’ on extreme high incomes would raise relatively little additional revenue, but would help ensure that the very rich make a fair contribution.

My guess with places like birmingham is that when you have large insular communities whose belief system/culture comes at odds with the established systems they feel more able to impose their ideologies on those around them.

I think that you could work out a formula based on the percentage of a minority within any given area town/city/region whatever, that will show when cultural problems will arise.

Think I remember reading the thread on that, there was some good advice. Hope it works out for you. 

&gt; The agent has my £1k deposit.

Should be held by DPS.

&gt; I can find a place

Great!

&gt; but good luck to me viewing anywhere with my full time job.

You can't book viewings in lunch breaks and before/after work?

&gt; Shame every agent I've ever dealt with demands you view the property before you take it.

Seems prudent and they're looking out for your interests. 

&gt; To add to that, I could pay the deposit out of my overdraft, not eating for a month did always sound like fun.

If you are renting it is *your* responsibility to be able to cover emergency situations that arise. Borrow if you have to.

&gt; I could quit my job and move 100 miles back to my parents and go on the dole.

Or you could extend your overdraft, put a deposit on a credit card, take out a loan, save money, ask family, etc.

&gt; Forget about the £100 fee for leaving my contract early, because the landlord and agents don't care someone threatened to kill me

£100 doesn't seem unreasonable.

&gt; they'll only release me early if it's into another property owned by the same landlord.

That's actually a lot more considerate than they'd need to be so don't treat it like it's adding insult to injury.

&gt; When I left my student accommodation I didn't get my deposit back for over 4 weeks.

When I left mine I didn't get my deposit back as there weren't the protections there are now.

&gt; I'm sure so many agencies would be happy to wait that long for their deposit. And if they did, being homeless during that time sounds like a proper adventure!

Again, it's your responsibility to cover that.

&gt; It's nowhere near as easy as you make out.

I didn't say it was easy, I said it was doable and it is.

Yup. And, really, just good television in general: If you regularly watch crap like Moffat has been producing over the past couple seasons you eventually recalibrate your mental scales and eventually you find yourself saying things like, ""Well, *Robots in Sherwood* wasn't as bad as it could have been. I mean, sure, there was the stupid bit with the arrow, but if you just ignore that the rest of it almost makes sense most of the time.""

But if you go and watch some television that's actually good, you'll suddenly realize that you've been suffering some sort of Dramatic Stockholm Syndrome.

The sad thing is that Moffat used to write brilliant television: *Blink* is one of the best episodes of *television* (not just *Doctor Who*) ever written. But the stuff he's writing now is poorly paced and poorly structured featuring plots that don't make sense and characters that are radically inconsistent. Even worse, the brilliant ideas have vanished in a puff of smoke: He appears to be incapable of writing an episode that doesn't rip off previous material from nuWho.

He actually wrote the exact same season finale three seasons in a row: A misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of an alternate timeline where the universe is destroyed, but then the Doctor finds a loophole that allows him to reboot the universe. Meek congratulations are, I suppose, due to him for not repeating it for a fourth time in Series 8... but since most of his Series 8 finale resulted from simply incoherently smashing the Series 2 and Series 3 finales together I'm not feeling overly generous.

Hes a kneejerker and it was plain within literally the very first two or three sentences he spoke that he didn't know what he was talking about. He got the score of the Liverpool 5-0 loss incorrect and bizarrely claimed that it was two years ago...

Cloake is just as bad. He tries to maintain a veneer of reasonableness but the reality is different. He claims that this is the worst squad we have had in 40 years and urged fans to 'make the current owners pay for ruining the club'. He has zero sense of perspective or any rationality. I actually used to really enjoy Claokes opinions and writings but frankly hes gone off the deep end over the last year or so.
 
You try to claim that Spurs have all of this money to spend that we dont? The figures for the 2012/2013 season back are freely available. Perhaps try to actually use facts when making arguments. The ignorance is absolutely incredible...

Also Tottenham have had 8 permanent managers, not the eleven that Neil tried to claim - and was completely unchallenged on. That's only 7 if you dont count Sherwood. It compares absolutely fine with other premier league clubs. 
Neil wanting Cortese in really says it all. Cortese is as close a chaiman to Levy as there is! The level of delusion is simply incredible.

The Telegraph is a particularly good example, you'd think they're a reputable broadsheet but they've got some weird digital program that's designed to maximise ad revenue and they've fired most of the journalists to save money. The result? It's utterly shit and strung together on wire copy and press releases.

The Sun is owned by the same company as The Times, and they have the same objective. To sell papers. They just do it in different ways.

Funnily enough, they (and this runs true for most papers) don't do this by making stuff up. Especially with regards to transfers. It's almost always an agent phoning up to get their client's name out there. Ribery's contract going down? Ribery's agent gets the Guardian on the phone, plants a story saying United are interested, suddenly they've got a negotiating position. It's irrelevant whether he'd sign for United or not. We saw it with Sterling and Real Madrid. 

Other times it's the club wanting to gauge interest in their players, by alerting other clubs to the fact that they're willing to do business. Or they're trying to see the fan reaction, or force questions from journalists covering the player's club concerning the interest. Sometimes it's even the player trying to get a move. Some papers are happy to play this game, some aren't. However, the stories aren't fabricated, when giving a story to an editor you'll have to say where you got it from. ""Some bloke down the pub"" doesn't cut it.

Anyway, don't discredit based on publication. Look at the byline, if you're going to play that game. The Daily Mail have great contacts in the Northern clubs, and the most reputable LFC journalist, Paul Joyce, has written for the Express for years.

One of the biggest, in fact I would argue the biggest reason for this position you and many others find themselves in is because of the quantity of immigrants England has absorbed in the last 2 decades. Taking your African heritage.. The average person is less likely to see you as a Brit, and therefore belonging to this land, when there is an unceasing flow of migrants from Africa and the Caribbean. It's rooted in tribal psychology that affects us all. Humans are wary of strangers and other. The average Joe is going to be more wary, and less likely to see a Black man in Britain as one of the tribe if we have an open door because we have no idea who they are and what culture they were influenced by. Close the border and people would assume you were born here and therefore share the same culture. The only way we are going to get a cohesive, more unified society is if we reduce the numbers of migrants, thus allowing time to force everyone to integrate. You and your descendents have as much a part and a role to play in the future of the country, don't let anyone UKIP or otherwise tell you different. BUT, if we keep our border porous, and unless you're the moneyed elite, you won't have as much of a stake because future generations will outsource your children's jobs and have a detrimental affect on their livelihoods to someone willing to work for half. But it's not only economics, too many migrants promotes social distrust and a culture of fear, because there's less imperative to be absorbed by the dominant culture.

I'm extremely happy with where we are. Thinking back to the start of the season, we really wanted some defensive cover - another quality CB and a full back to push Rangel and/ or Taylor. We wanted a box-to-box, imposing center mid. Some even wanted another winger (Payet) for coverage on the outside.

Looking at our squad now, I think our defense is still our weak link - but only two teams have conceded fewer than us, and they're at the top of the table. I think Taylor is improving before our eyes - namely after the Newcastle game. Rangel isn't getting any younger, and I think we're seeing his final year as a starter.

I think our offense could really explode if we could play Bafé and Bony up top. I think Bony is the stronger of the two, but late in the game, I think Bony's positioning suffers - hence the sub against Arsenal. Problem with playing both is that they'd be taking a midfielder position, and we need our midfielders back to help cover on defense. 

Overall, I'm very pleased and I think we're in line for a top 8 finish. I think Monk has us playing extremely well defensively - we fall in line and know how to pack it in.

First, the shell falls into a depth of field issue where it feels flat compared to this awesomely dynamic creature underneath.  I would suggest adding some more shading or details (hatches, lines, etc.) to give that big white space some feeling of being a part of the larger work.  As it stands, that space looks somewhat like an area that hasn't been entirely completed in the sense that it lacks the depth of the rest of the work.  

Lighting in space is a tricky thing because you want it to look a little more stark than it would be as diffused through an atmosphere, but you don't want to sacrifice the feeling of depth at the same time.

Having the straight line of the city skyline also clashes with the creature somewhat, but if you were to subtly tilt the lower line of the buildings to a diagonal it suddenly creates a feeling of movement along the path of the creature.

Again, fantastic work.  The whale itself is wonderfully detailed and drawn, making me really feel like it's moving in space gracefully and naturally.  Build on that strength and you'll make some great artwork.

I remember reading the exact same articles in the mid 1990's (when the digital age started) and then late 1990s/early 2000's (when the bubble burst &amp; all the articles were about how the internet industry was doomed). I'm sure these types of articles happen every decade or so as tech evolves and people get scared.

You say that jobs aren't created for the sake of it, but jobs are created when new things emerge. For example, I joined a FTSE 100 company in the late 90's and was in their web team... back then it was 5 people and when I left it was well over 100. Those jobs simply didn't exist before. Granted this is just anecdotal, but it does happen.

I agree that certain industries will reduce massively, but conversely certain new industries will expand massively... this has always happened and isn't new to this generation. Think about how many people are employed by Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, IBM, HP etc. now compared to the 70's...

Final thought - predictions from experts are notoriously crap. It's almost impossible to predict what will have in 5 years yet alone 20. My main point is maybe we should look at the past technological leaps to see what's likely to happen in the in the future... if technological advances always killed more jobs than it created then we'd be at 99% unemployment now.

Teenagers are sociable people too. Once in a blue moon, the topic arises, not just because I'm camp anyway, but I like to incorporate citizenship into my lessons too.  

What? Do you think I swan into the classroom shitting rainbows and glitter, announcing to my pupils that I'm gay for no reason at all? Do you think I stop childrens' education for one hour by giving a political speech on gay rights and the world-wide injustices the LGBTQ community face every day just to satisfy myself into thinking I make a difference? What a sheltered life you must live. I teach teenagers how to read. I teach teenagers the difference between passive and active verbs. I teach teenagers how to write poetry. And, if the situation calls for it when a teenager asks ""Sir, are you gay?"" I answer truthfully, say ""Yes"", and then teach them about how to use semi-colons correctly.  

My job is to educate, facilitate learner-needs, and to encourage learners to think for themselves. If I ""brainwash"" them, I would have been kicked off my teacher-training course months ago.

I agree completely with your thoughts on Salah. 

I think Willian/Ramires down the right side is crucial for us though as first team choice since our front end is left sided. You don't see Matic and Fabregas running as often to cover opponents down the right since our Brazilians always have it covered. Hazard has been better on the defensive end, but I think if we had Reus we'd obviously press a lot more on the right and would force Hazard back to cover more tracking back after our attacks. It would be interesting to see a more offensive threat down the right and how it would effect the dynamics of Chelsea. Of course if Jose signs Reus, I would not complain! He is a great player. I don't see it happening this january though, he's cup tied and has been loyal to Dortmund so I don't think he'd ditch them midseason, especially with rut they're in now.

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;There is an agenda which will reduce low achievement. It means reaching more fully those who most need help – children in public care, those with Special Educational Needs and those very much larger numbers who are not in desperate plight but still need considerably greater help from the education system. The agenda lies in pre-school, primary schools and secondary schools. Early-years provision has to do better in reaching the most disadvantaged, particularly to help improve parenting and early learning. In schools there is a need for some reallocation and enhancement of expenditures; reform of features of the school system which actually contribute to low achievement; and addressing the other policy priorities listed above. All these could considerably reduce the numbers of young people who currently leave school with difficult prospects. Giving far greater priority to reducing low achievement by these means would represent money and effort well spent, both for the individuals concerned and for society at large.

People have various biological pulsions. Some are naturally more violent, some are attracted by people of the same sex. You can choose to act against your pulsions. And it is up to society to debate and define what are socially acceptable behaviours.

In all cases, it is not acceptable to have different legal rights for sex and race because you cannot change it at all, there is no choice at all. But sexual norms are debatable. Family structure is debatable. I am in favor of 100% free sexuality and non-traditional family structures, but I perfectly understand that other people may disagree.

So yes, homosexual pulsions are not a choice, practicing homosexuality is a choice. If you disagree, it means you don't understand the word choice, or that you do not believe in free-will.

Just like pedophilia. Some people are naturally attracted to young children. It is a natural pulsion that they have not chosen, just like homosexuals. But society thinks that pedophilia is a mental desease and is illegal, even when the pedophile do not touch children, even when the child agrees to have sexual relations with the pedophile. Pedophilic pulsions are not a choice, but pedophilic actions are a choice and are illegal.

If you take a picture of your baby naked taking a bath and put it on Facebook with public access, this is stupid but no harm is done to the baby while taking the picture. If you collect tousands of pictures of naked babies uploaded by stupid parents, the justice system will send you to jail for pedophilia.

Towards the beginning of the season that Gerrard was hurt and Allen took his place. Our pace on the counter attacks were quick and we were able to demolish teams. Gerrard was out and we had a great run of wins in the premier league. He came back and we still won, but not as convincingly. Of course there was also moments where he saved our asses, that amazing pass to sturridge against Fulham comes to mind, but my point is still valid. He came back and we lost a step or two.
Now to the solution. From what I've seen, I REALLY like Can. He has had some good runs and has great stamina. Plus he can muscle people off the ball. I would really to see him take over Gerrard's new role and give us that enforcer type midfielder that some of us are calling for.

America's own issues came as a direct result of their foreign policy. The same applies to all of the other NATO nations who had to deal with terrorism following the invasions. 

If I recall correctly the west's problem with Islamic extremism began with 9/11. Even if you think we just used 9/11 as an excuse to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, it doesn't dilute the fact that Osama Bin Laden was a billionaire saudi who wasn't at all personally affected by any of the grievances he had with the west. He could have just sat on his oil money living comfortably for the rest of his days but instead chose to become the most wanted man on Earth. Why? because he was motivated by a primarily religious ideology to attack what he saw as the main enemy of Islam, the west.

&gt;If ""extremists"" hate democracy, personal freedom and hedonism

It's not hard to find the testimonies of Islamic terrorists on the internet, although they have a specific hatred for the western world because of our involvement in the Middle East, they also very much despise democracy, personal freedom and hedonism. There's no **if**whatsoever.

&gt;They are proof positive that religious writings have little effect on culture. People are people. 

This is an incredibly ignorant statement, do you really believe that religion has no effect on human culture? One merely has to compare the Wahhabi laws of Saudi Arabia with the secular laws of any western country to realise how wrong this statement is. People **are** people and people are very much social animals whose behaviours are dictated by the highly specific cultural climate in which they live.

The ""they just hate us solely because of our greedy imperialism"" narrative breaks down when you look at the fact that the vast majority of deaths in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were caused by Muslims killing other Muslims, and if fighting against western invaders was the prime motive for terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan then how do you explain the rapid rise of IS **after** coalition forces left Iraq? How do explain westerners who have converted to Islam leaving behind their comfy lives in Europe and NA to die in Iraq and Syria by the hundreds if not for religious ideals? 

If I may draw an apt comparison, the Nazis used German anger over the treaty of Versailles and it's after effects to build support for themselves and take over Germany, but the holocaust was uniquely inspired by nazi ideas about race, the *belief* in the supremacy of the aryan race and the evil of the Jews lead to the *action* of the holocaust. Likewise, the belief in the glory of martyrdom and the wickedness of non-Muslim civilisation, combined with geopolitical factors gives rise to the rampant Islamic terrorism we see today.",0,1415740376,null,0,false,0,clzqdoy,t3_2lxlzm,t1_clzqdoy,t1_clzn2hg,null,1426074148,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Well it's now shown that we benefit from EU-migrants so clearly the economic component is baloney but instead now people seem to forget all the arguments that the likes of Farage brought up that were wholly economic in bases. In his debates with Clegg he said hoards of Romanians and Bulgarians would flood us and that our infrastructure would buckle by the seams. Well, we've just found out that we always have had the power to curtail the number of EU-migrants coming in by deterring those who'd be a drain by simply tightening on benefit handouts. So regardless of free movement we won't have an EU-immigration problem, there won't be millions of Huns at the gate, our NHS won't collapse under the weight of all of it because now they'll have less reason to stay without assistance just like other EU countries.

Now that it's shown that their economic arguments have been proved either wrong, or not as big an issue as they make it out to be, they've (or at least one person) suddenly said it was never about the economics of it and it was wholly about culture and integration and nothing else; that's moving the goal posts back.

- Demebele while he still has some pretty solid value. He just hasn't seemed like the same player that he was a few years ago and really isn't the type of player we need now.
- Lennon just doesn't seem to fit in Poch's plans and being an English lad would likely fetch a pretty decent fee for him. To add to that he's still a pacy player and still has a good number of years left in him and will certainly have a choice of suitors. 
- Paulinho He's meh and has really only had a handful of decent games for the club but I'd venture to guess some still rate him and so would fetch a pretty decent fee. I can see him playing in Europe, the Russian league or even back in Brazil. 
- BAE for the reasons we all know. If we can sell him it will be for a packet of crisps. 

Now for the more potentially controversial.

- Vert For me, he can go and go for the biggest fee we can get. He seems to have a pretty serious attitude and hasn't been anywhere near the world class player that so many are quick to call him. For being a supposed leader (and I know he was captain at Ajax, but anyone can be a leader of boys...not everyone can be a leader of men) his attitude has been seemingly shit. He has been a liability defensively on numerous occasions in the past few seasons. While many point to Kaboul when they've played as a pairing, Vert is the one who gets targeted more often as the weak one by our opposition. To add to it all he has already refused a new deal at the club. 
- One of Ade or Soldado. I'd prefer it be Ade personally but that's because Soldado is a bit more suited for what I believe Poch would like in more of a free flowing type attack. Ade is too undisciplined for it IMO.

Part of the agreement is that EEA members have to comply with the *acquis communicaire* aka the legislative regulations of the Single Market aka ""single regulatory region:-

http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement

&gt;*The EEA Agreement provides for the inclusion of EU legislation covering the four freedoms — the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital — throughout the 31 EEA States. In addition, the Agreement covers cooperation in other important areas such as research and development, education, social policy, the environment, consumer protection, tourism and culture, collectively known as “flanking and horizontal” policies. The Agreement guarantees equal rights and obligations within the Internal Market for citizens and economic operators in the EEA.*

The exceptions are:- 

* Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies (although the Agreement contains provisions on various aspects of trade in agricultural and fish products);
* Customs Union;
* Common Trade Policy;
* Common Foreign and Security Policy;
* Justice and Home Affairs (even though the EFTA countries are part of the Schengen area); or
* Monetary Union (EMU).

To put a rough comparison to it:-

EU = 100% Acquis
EEA = 80%
Bi-Laterals Swiss = 40%

What's interesting is the original source of this, and hence influence on the source:-

Coming back to ""Influence"" there is no direct influence in the EU Institutions eg Parliament, Council etc.

However this is more than made up for via hierarchical structures of global sources of regulation. You can learn all about this watching this presentation:-

It is culture which is making the muslims you encounter behave the way they do. If you travel around you will find that most muslims are peaceful, accepting and generally a lot like the christian faith. Coinciding religion and culture also doesn't work very well, as different muslims have different traditions and culture all over the world. 

Furthermore, your comment about the quran being oppressive towards women is misguided, the hijab is not compulsory for women. 

To sum up, ""british values"" and the islamic faith are two completely different things that cannot interrupt each other in any serious way. If muslims are hassling you and being aggressive this is not in the true spirit of the ummah, and according to their faith they will answer for their actions and intentions on the day of judgement.

As for the girl, I think we have to make our own mistakes sometimes to learn, just some of us learn faster, don't bury our heads in the sand etc.  London is very easy to burn money on 'social' things, going shopping with the girls or whatever, food, crap you don't need, adds up quick.

My own LSA might result in that return trip costing only £80, that's cheaper than the 6 hours on the train.  I'm saving money honest.

It's funny we're quite off on a tangent now, but my point is that many people relied on credit for their lifestyle today, rather than for a better lifestyle for tomorrow.

The show isn't 'for kids' and it isn't 'for adults' Doctor Who is a family show which is usually very kid friendly but really the show is pitched at older children and younger teens, if they pitch the show at 20 to 30 somethings then it fails to maintain its core identity.  The children it does cater to are learning about the adult world, exploring concepts beyond fantasy or family and will be learning about choices in the adult world, being true to science even a little can urge young people into those roles as a career as they want to learn more, or they may want to be writers or work in media, if all they pick up from Doctor Who is how low the bar can be it doesn't really help anything.  

Doctor Who can be there to have a positive impact on young people, I suppose it's not obliged to anymore than say a musician has to be positive role model to anyone, it's their life and people can enjoy music on their terms, but on the other hand it can have a role if it chooses to.

Usually someone saying 'its a show' has run out of anything useful to add, why should we bother to discuss anything if the answer is 'it's just a show'.

That said (which is what always seems to come before something harsh on this forum), I'm really fucking sick of hearing that Toure should've started against Chelsea because it's borderline retarded. 

Kolo Toure is 33 years old and just put everything he had into a great performance against the 2nd best team in the world. Don't you think he might need to fucking recover?

Gigs tended to be more basic too. Ian Dury and the Blockheads at Sheffield Poly, a few hundred people in the audience, and they were in the charts at the time.

Nowadays it does seem a lot more like someone somewhere decides who is going to be the next big thing, and Radio 1 play them 4 times an hour, all day every day until it happens.

That doesn't mean I'll get it back any quicker. You keep saying its peoples responsibility to have enough for deposits etc., but then you recommend I borrow off family? Well regardless, I can't borrow off anybody. My family is poor. My mum is a single mother working in a taxi office and my dad's an alcoholic. I can't get a loan because I have poor credit due to a CCJ in my name (let me guess, that's my fault too. Never mind the actual details surround it). My overdraft can't be increased as it's a student overdraft. It is what it is and surprise, it's already the maximum my bank will allow. I've been trying to get out of it for over a year now but everytime I save a load of money, some new expenditure arises. Laptop repair so I can do my Uni work, suits for the stupid job I have where I must dress smart, rent every month, bills, food, phone bills, Internet (let me guess, you're the kind of person who says those aren't essential? Well they are if you're a student and looking for jobs/need to call estate agents). So it goes without saying I can barely get out of my overdraft, let alone save for a deposit. 

I work 45 hours a week as an intern essentially earning less than £6 an hour and you make out its so easy to just pluck £1.5k out of thin air and move. Your logic is flawed. You can't pay a deposit before you've received your old deposit back. You can't save up months worth of upfront rent if you can't even afford the deposit. You can't afford months of rent upfront if you can't even get out of an overdraft. You can't easily get out of an overdraft on low wages and with poor credit. 

Yes I can view places on my lunch, I've managed to squeeze in one in the whole month I've been looking because like I said, by the time I've arranged a viewing the property has already gone. I cannot even express how many times I've had that happen to me. 

And looking for a new place to live needn't *be* an emergency situation. You seem forget having a home to live in is essentially a human right. I shouldn't have to worry, panic, scrimp and save, stress, miss work, distract myself from my education, impoverish myself just to find another shitty bedsit to live in. 

£100 release fee isn't unreasonable if you can afford it. I can't, so I'm stick until I can save it up (on top of the other things like £400 minimum upfront for rent, up to £1000 deposit, £100 moving van etc.) 

And offering me a new place is considerate? When the neighbour who lives 5 feet away in another bedsit in the same building had tried to kick my door down and murder me? When he was openly telling the police when they arrived that he wanted to snap my neck? And it's *considerate* of them to let me move? I have to take a knife with me just to go shit in the toilet past his door. I have to piss in my own sink because I'm scared I'll bump in to him in the hall. I don't leave my room except to go to work as I'm worried I'll cross him on the stairs. Why thank you so much, proof if ever it was needed that my life is worthless because I'm a poor person forced to abide by poor peoples rules and live in a poor mans world.

We see Missy occasionally in the Nethersphere, talking to Seb. There are two methods to access the Matrix, the Crown of Rassilon that allowed access to the information stored there, and the Key of Rassilon, which opened the Seventh Door, and allowed a person to physical travel to the micro-universe.

The Master had previously copied the Key of Rassilon (The Ultimate Foe); so it seems, to me at least, that Missy's bracelet was another copy of the Key of Rassilon.

While radio, television and record labels do still wield considerable power, their power to dictate and direct who listens to what is diminishing. I'm in my late 20s so I might be considered the last of the pre-internet generation. Kids nowadays are all looking in different directions, because of the limitless novelty and freedom of the internet. The days of Radio 1 DJs like Peel promoting music and having an army of dedicated listeners are fading. Top of the pops used to be massively influential, now no. The problem is twofold, firstly people just plain aren't purchasing music any more because it's all streamed for free on Youtube etc, secondly the internet means I can listen to any number of radio stations from around the world, or more likely get my recommendations from computer software algorithms like Spotify's recommended playlist. Kids nowadays won't tolerate radio advertisements or playing certain songs they don't like, because they can just play a customised playlist and know what they are getting.

Naturally in order to get paid artists have been doing more and more live shows and selling merchandise. While this works for Rock and Pop, some genres and indeed some musicians can't really do live shows as well as they can in a studio. Rap is a good example. There's also a big problem in actually getting famous enough to get the army of fans willing to actually pay to go to your show. It's harder now because there are no labels and because music is now infinite and limitless, it's perceived economic value is lower than it was. I don't think the quality of music has declined, it's just harder to amass a following.
The main beneficiaries of this internet age seem to be artists who made their name and their livelihoods in the 1965-2000 era of recorded music. They're famous enough to make a living touring. Other industries are heading the same way, notably the book industry with the proliferation of e-books and Kindles, it'll follow the same trend. Stephen King will do fine, someone starting out probably won't.

The highlight story on that page is a guy who built up £80,000(!!) on credit cards and offset it against his mortgage to save £5,000.

Key thing that's missing on that page these days is the Egg Money card.  As far as I know, that was the only credit card that let you go into the black and get the money back so people would balance transfer at 0% against the Egg Money card and then use that to get their hands on the cash.

&gt; Mitchell travels the world for Southampton and is credited with the majority of incoming transfers since his arrival at the club two years ago, having held the same position at MK Dons after finishing his playing career.

Ok, so lets look at all the signings that we have had in the two years that he's been here and judge which ones this guy pushed through.

**Tadic** and **Pelle** were scouted by Koeman before he even walked through the door. Koeman also stated that he had wanted **Mane** when he was at Ajax. So we can rule those three out.

**Gaston** and **Osvaldo** were clearly Cortese's Italy connections. 

**Bertrand**, **Long** were already known in the PL already, and **Forster** and **Wanyama** were known in Scotland and even the champions league, as was **Alderweireld**. So we know that he has FIFA 13 at least. 

So essentially the only players that we can legitimately credit this guy with are: **Lovren and Yoshida**. *Fine.*  **Mayuka and Gardos**. *Ok.* **Saphir Taider and Vegard Forren**. Well done. 

Also:

&gt; Southampton do not want to lose Mitchell, 33, but he is believed to be keen on the opportunity of working at a club as big as Tottenham.

Mate, if you're going to leave then at least move to an actual big club.

First, the decision to simply not resolve the cliffhanger at the end of the second series. The ambiguity is arguably interesting, but it's a burnt earth approach to writing: You presented a seemingly insoluble mystery, implied that the solution to it would be amazing, and then deliberately decided not to solve it. Fair enough. But that means the one thing that won't be effective again is hanging a cliffhanger on a seemingly insoluble mystery: No one is going to take it seriously because you've already made it clear you have no intention of providing a satisfactory conclusion.

And yet what do they do literally three episodes later? Present the exact same cliffhanger a second time, but this time featuring a different character.

That would be lazy and uninspired writing at the best of times. But it's particularly anemic because they've already established that they have no intention of following through.

Second, the third series also featured a lot of sloppy writing that looks exactly like the sloppy writing we're seeing over in *Doctor Who*. A key example here is the season finale: It depends entirely on Magnussen failing to search them for weapons, despite the fact that the episode explicitly established that Magnussen has everyone he meets with searched for weapons.

In order for *Sherlock* to work as a series, it has to actually deliver sharp, clever scripts that support the conceit that its main character is sharp and clever.",0,1415748373,null,0,false,0,clzuov8,t3_2lu2dq,t1_clzuov8,t1_clyn6zl,null,1426072066,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You can not say with any certainty that Germany would have invaded Britian had Britain not got involved in WWI.

We had every business fighting WWI, we were duty bound by the treaties we signed. Whether we were right in singing those treaties is another matter altogether. And it was Germany's ambition to unify Europe from Iberia to the Urals, an area which includes the British Isles.

&gt;Liberty and Justice are not something woven in to the fabric of the universe, they are concepts of Man. Consequently, you can not find freedom through a belief in such. True freedom is something found from within and not something handed to you through a given 'ideal'.

The universe itself is a concept of Man, it would be meaningless if there was no concious beings to observe it. I'm not really sure what you're getting at ""finding freedom from within"", if it's happening within you it still has to pass through the mind of man which you've just argued is flawed.

&gt;There are only individuals, a country is just some lines on a map. Any notion that one ought to serve a piece of dirt is beyond stupid. What you are really saying is you will mindlessly serve the wishes of the government without question. Unless you think that somehow throughout all of time and history there is something special about the ideology of the UK government? 

Wrong. A country is a people, a society. Borders exist for a reason, they mark the boundaries of a shared culture and language. If countries were a collection of people thrown together by an accident of birth what makes us distinct from the French, the Spanish, the Americans or the Kazakhs? Or are you going to be one of those fools who try to argue nationality isn't real? I wouldn't die for any politicians but if my family and homeland was seriously under threat from an external enemy I'd be first in the volunteer queue.

&gt;That is not correct. All the warrior castes throughout history saw nothing more noble than war. All the great men in history were warriors that conquered weaker peoples. Do you think Ed Miliband will go down in history with the great leaders of past eras? If not why not?

Just because many great men were warriors doesn't mean they all were. I consider Sir Isaac Newton, H.G Wells and Nikola Tesla to be great men, and even great men implicated in the creation of weapons such as Einstein or Turing were hardly warriors. Ed Miliband will go down in history as a weak leader because he has poor social skills, fails to engage with the demographic he's supposed to be representing and has kept the Labour Party drifting in the direction of authoritarianism and pointless identity politics.

[Empire Podcast](http://www.empireonline.com/podcast/) - Guys from Empire Magazine that talk about films and have interesting guests. My personal favourite ones are where they talk about films that have been recently released with no fear of spoilers.

[How Did This Get Made?](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/how-did-this-get-made/id409287913?mt=2) - This is about films that are so bad they try to figure out why they even exist.

[The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/) - American MMA commentator gets guests on to talk about themselves and their fields. Joe takes a bit of getting used to but he has some great guests on. Worth checking out are Bert Kreischer and Louis Theroux.

[The John Dredge Nothing to do with Anything Show](http://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/john_dredge_show/) - This is an insane comedy show. It is hard to explain but I think it's very funny.

[The Nerdist](https://www.nerdist.com/category/podcast/) - Lots and lots of celebrity podcasts. Everyone from Gabe Newell to Simon Pegg. Most famously Tom Hanks who was bribed to appear on the show by a nice typewriter and comes across as a very nice guy.

[The Duncan Tressell Family Hour](http://duncantrussell.com/) - Similar to Joe Rogan, lots about metaphysics and drug philosophies.

[My local cinema has a podcast](https://soundcloud.com/majestic-cinema). It's not bad but it is just starting and they seem to be trying to find their feet.

false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; I can't stand it when people pick apart my whole speech piece by piece.

No one likes being fisked, but your arguments warranted it.

&gt; You keep saying its peoples responsibility to have enough for deposits etc.

It is.

&gt; but then you recommend I borrow off family?

I don't recommend it, I merely identify it as an option for some people.

&gt; let me guess, you're the kind of person who says [Laptop repair so I can do my Uni work, suits for the stupid job I have where I must dress smart, rent every month, bills, food, phone bills, Internet] aren't essential?

It's up to you to prioritise your spending. If you are living beyond your means it's your responsibility to address that.

&gt; I work 45 hours a week as an intern essentially earning less than £6 an hour and you make out its so easy to just pluck £1.5k out of thin air and move. Your logic is flawed.

Do you really not see the inconsistency between your choices meaning you don't have enough money for a deposit and blaming me for my logic being flawed? 

&gt; You can't pay a deposit before you've received your old deposit back.

You can with credit, you can if you plan for it, you can if you earn enough, you can if you make decisions that enable it.

&gt; You can't afford months of rent upfront if you can't even get out of an overdraft. You can't easily get out of an overdraft on low wages and with poor credit. 

True. If that is your situation you have to either make do as best you can or change your circumstances by giving up a low paid internship and instead opting for better paid but less useful for your career work. 

&gt; You seem forget having a home to live in is essentially a human right.

If that were true then we wouldn't have any homeless people. No one has or should have a right to something that they cannot afford as this infringes on other peoples rights.

&gt; And it's considerate of them to let me move?

No, it's considerate for them to offer to waive the fee if you were to remain with the same landlord.

&gt; Why thank you so much, proof if ever it was needed that my life is worthless because I'm a poor person forced to abide by poor peoples rules and live in a poor mans world. 

Self pity? Look, I get that you aren't in an ideal situation with your neighbour threatening you but whining doesn't help. 

&gt; Again, your mentality is cancerous. Your world view is just utterly wrong and it beggars belief that you could have such vitriolic beliefs. You're disgusting. I hope you enjoyed the attention. 

Your childish naivety is oddly charming and redolent of the ""If you aren't a liberal at 20 you have no heart and if you aren't a conservative at 40 you have no brain"" way of thinking. If you don't want to accept any personal responsibility for the situation you find yourself in and believe that fate has conspired against you, that's your business. Hopefully you'll grow out of it and achieve wisdom sooner rather than later however, for your own sake if for nothing else. My world view is unpleasant but accurate. I don't think this way because it brings me comfort, I think this way because the evidence supports it. It may not be how you think it should be but that hardly makes it wrong. I hope you find a positive resolution to your situation.",0,1415749186,null,0,false,0,clzv3gj,t3_2ly9mb,t1_clzv3gj,t1_clzsvoj,null,1426071878,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,strolls,null,null,"Depends how you define ""luxury"" - this is probably just a big saloon car, something a bit bigger than a Mondeo, large enough that he can stretch his legs out and spread documents over the back seat beside him so that he can work as he travels.

Even if the car is a decent Merc or a BMW, part of the reason for buying such a car would be reliability. I don't know how much such cars cost, but if it's an extra £30,000 then that doesn't make much difference over a 3-year service life, compared to the cost of drivers.

Ministers presumably have to go all over London to meetings, and up and down the country opening schools and factories and whatnot, and I don't really see how it's realistic to have them call a minicab every time.

Are you going to have taxi firms sending random drivers into Whitehall offices to pick up ministers? Alone, the costs of them running late would probably dwarf the current expenditure - government ministers, mayors and dozens of civil servants wasting time every time a car is delayed. 

£500,000 seems a lot of money, but that's for several cars over 2½ years - the annual cost of a car seems to be £90,000 - £120,000, but that must include multiple drivers to accommodate the length of a minister's working day. Presumably the drivers are prohibited by law from working more than 8 or 10 hours a day, and I believe [Pickles has said in the past that he leaves for the office at 6am and is often not back home until midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Pickles#Second_home). I honestly don't begrudge him a driver, but this would be not be any cheaper if we punted the job out to Addison-Lee to provide security-vetted drivers.

The fans? They're powerless and won't ever unite against ticket prices in the sort of boycott that would actually make a difference. Plus more often than not the fans complain that their clubs don't spend *enough* money on players.

The players? Why would they do anything other than accept the best offer placed on the table for them? How many people in the world would take a wage cut when they could be paid more to do the exact same job somewhere else? Especially when you're running up against a forced retirement when you get to your late 30's. 

The club? They can offer lower wages and lower ticket prices, but then they don't win trophies, so their sponsorship income and prize money drops off completely until after a few decades they're at the kind of status of a League One club and don't even have a large fanbase any more.

The FA? They could impose a wage cap, but then all the good players would fuck off to La Liga and such, the Premier League would drop in commercial value as a spectacle, and suddenly they have far less money.

UEFA? FIFA? They don't give a shit - the bigger the amounts of money being thrown around in TV deals and sponsorships the more they're lining their own pockets.

I would not vote for a party like the UKIP or the BNP on those grounds alone.

I have no issue with the Muslims who come to this country and just want to get on with their lives. They are free to practice their religion and they are free to live here. I'm all for that. That's great.

A big part of British culture is that we keep our spiritual beliefs and our religions a private affair. We don't broadcast them in public. We don't try to convert other people to our religions. If there are Muslims out there who are trying to do that, many of us *will* feel uncomfortable about that.

Politically I am left wing, but that doesn't mean I don't have opinions about the way some Muslims here conduct themselves. I do always try to bear in mind that for every Muslim that aggressively tries to shove their religion down other peoples' throats, there are 20 or 30 other Muslims that don't. But those that *do* shouldn't be ignored. It's a real problem now. We've actually had British nationals go off to Syria to fight for ISIS or ISIL or whatever the fuck they're calling themselves these days. That, to me, is a legit issue and one that we should be addressing.

Ultimately I agree... I find Islam to be a bit of a backwards and barbaric religion... but maybe that's because the loudest Muslims are the worst ones, and shouldn't even be *called* Muslims. I only have one friend who is a Muslim and he's the most chilled out guy I know - a huge geek, obsessed with comic books and video games. Granted, he grew up in the West and is mostly a strict Muslim out of choice rather than obligation. He won't touch alcohol or pork, but he'll discuss Harry Potter with me for hours on end. He's the reason I bothered to give the Qu'ran a read. I was genuinely curious about his religion. That's anecdotal... but I figured I'd add it in to say there *are* sane Muslims out there. The only time I shook my head at him is when we had to walk almost 5 miles off-route in Amsterdam so he could find a place to pray, haha.

Eugh. I think it's good to talk about this. It's good to discuss it, it shouldn't be a taboo topic. We have lots of Muslims in the UK now and it's a fairly recent phenomenon too. I can rest assured that the majority of British Muslims out there are disgusted by groups like ISIS, but there's always that minority...

CL is important, but if we don't make it past the group it's only 6 extra games, so not really all that unmanageable.

&gt;The __Atanasoff–Berry computer__ (__ABC__) was the first automatic electronic digital computer, an early [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics) [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data) [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) device that has remained somewhat obscure. To say that it was the first is a debate among historians of computer technology as it was not [programmable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). Many Americans credit [John Mauchly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly) and [J. Presper Eckert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert), creation the [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC),  which came into use in July 1946, with the title. Others cite the British contender Colossus, a development team headed by Tommy Flowers demonstrated Colossus to be working on December 8, 1943. The world's first electronic digital computer that was programmable, it ran at a remarkable (for the time) 5.8 MHz. Designed and used exclusively for code breaking during World War II, after the war alternative uses were considered, but they remained in use for their original purpose until the late 1950's.

I think that really shows how damaging this 3 managers in 18 months thing has become for the squad as a whole. How is Pochettino going to convince everyone that he's here for the long haul.

Moreover you get yourself into a tricky position because by your argument it should be legal to steal music and give it away for free but illegal to steal music and charge people to download it (eg pre-release). I don't find that a satisfactory state of affairs.

We might designate that enemy as : Christian, feudalist, capitalist, and imperialist. So all the Left has ever know how to fight is the Christian Capitalists.

But on 9/11, an old but newly ascendant global Right reared it's ugly head: the Islamists. This ideology has come from regions of the world where there has never really even been a Protestant Reformation, let alone a French Revolution. The interpretation of scripture is still basically dictated from above in the Muslim world. Muslims have never declared, as Martin Luther, William Tyndale (the brave  Englishman) did, that they will be the ones to read scripture in their own language, rather than have it dictated to them in Latin.

Islam is still like that pre-Reformation Christianity, in which the scripture is only considered hold if it is written and spoken in a secret language (Classical Arabic), and thus the interpretation of the religion left up to this aristocratic class of scholars called the *ulema*, and of course, they give the worst interpretation possible. The consequence is that the faith is interpreted by many in a basically fascist way, as a complete system of feudal, patriarchal domination, which is meant to exert control over all human life.

The Muslim world has exploded demographically, and this Islamic Right now challenges the West. But since the Islamic Right, and the Western Right are enemies of one another, the natural inclination of the Left has been to basically pretend that the former doesn't exist, for fear of putting wind at the back of the latter.

I watched their progress in the championship statistically, I wasn't able to catch any games. Just pictures from the website and match reports. Gutted when we fell down another league. Optimistic when we were threatening promotion against a huge points gap and had the backing of a competent owner. The best part was youtube was gaining real popularity so now besides le tiss highlights, I started seeing tributes to lallana and oxlade chamberlain show up, I could see my saints more frequently. I also watched how academy products that had moved on to the likes of arsenal and spurs were doing and would take pleasure in the fact the club had helped produce that talent. Then the double promotion and the NBC deal, and suddenly it is this explosia of joy and excitement all bubbiling over because I could be there match day watching this team I love in action.

They don't integrate.  They aren't like us.  They don't accept our values.  Sure some may not,  but generalisations are always useless.

Not at all am I defending his actions, nor his Dapper Laughs ""character."" His attitudes towards women and the comedy routines around glorifying and trivializing rape were pretty disgusting, backwards and unnecessary. However, he seems completely astounded that it's gotten to this point where his career has basically been killed in a period of 48 hours. And perhaps it's right that it has come to this.

Dapper Laugh's wasn't funny, clever or remotely entertaining in the slightest, the show should have never been commissioned, it was misogynistic rubbish. But I really don't think he deserves as much flack as he is currently receiving.

Especially when you have people like Ched Evans actually performing rape on a women and being allowed to continue his career as a footballer, not to mention Julien Blanc teaching men to shove women's faces into your crouch as a pick up tactic, I think Daniel O'Reilly should not be the focus of attention any more.

Regardless of his opinion, Dundee Utd should still have to pay the full amount quoted (I think it's £200,000?). The debate should be about what part of that money goes to the oldco, if any should.

All bad things, it's agreed. Two distinctions are important here. 

1) None of those things comes within a mile of the horrifying shit that sharia law dictates. If all of those things magically became law tomorrow, U.S. society would still be hundreds of years ahead of the sort of society that muslim extremests push in the U.K.

2) Not a single one of those issues is winning on any significant level, and the constitution ultimately prohibits several of them. *Democracy* and social opinion is changing the legal landscape on all of those in the right direction. It's probably happening slower than you would like, but it is happening because we have a largely free and open society. Good luck getting any of that shit done under sharia law. Good luck not getting killed for suggesting that kind of thing under the sort of society that radical muslims advocate.

Also my guess is that you like when democracy limits freedom and dictates views on others, so long as they are *your* views. You don't seem like much of an AnCap, so i would wager that you weren't too mad when the PPACA used the very same system to *force* Americans who would otherwise not buy insurance to do so. I don't support any of the things you listed or the PPACA, but I can at least appreciate that democracy has two sides and a system of arbitration.
