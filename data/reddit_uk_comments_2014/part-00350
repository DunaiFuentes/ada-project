false,B23vital,null,null,"I KNOW people that have intentionally made themselves homeless. Im not 100% on details (i was in contact but she didnt give me a step by step guide) but one example is a friend that left home, told the council her mother kicked her out, which her mother was aware of and helping. She backed up the story saying she can no longer cope with her and the council moved her into emergency accommodation. 
It isn't just hostels we have here, a friend of myn was sleeping rough, couch surfing from mates houses until the council put him in a young housing association building ( im unsure of the real name, but i can give an address and name of building privately if you would like to look it up, im not willing to give my area away online). He lived there for 2 years paying minimal rent, something like £15 a week, plus gas, electric, food ect. On JSA this is hard, but he also worked cash in hand at a taxi rank. He blew most of his money on nights out and drugs, when your surrounded by other young adults living in the same building its easily done. About 6months ago he got a flat provided by the council, and after a few weeks there, the job centre got him a job, practically minimum wage, around £7 an hour. 
All he does is moan how easy life was before work, he complains non stop about having to go to work, and doesn't appreciate the fact everything has been provided on a plate for him. 
Now im aware these may be extreme cases, ones that slip under the councils radar, but it does happen, and by me it happens a lot. 
I could go on for hours with stories of people i personally know being provided with everything by the council. This may not happen so much in your area ( if you could disclose that would be great myn is birmingham!). But the stories could go on, if you are interested i will happily provide more information but unfortunately no names as im not willing to provide other peoples details.

The thing about the ""bad apples"" argument is that you are allowed one or two bad apples. Fred Phelps was a Democrat, for example. But when time and time again we find that Gamergate isn't even just supported by far-right nutters, but actually led by a number of them then alarm bells should start going off. There's only so many times you can say ""Ah, he was a one-off, ah, we pushed him out (despite him continuing to tweet about it to a positive reception)"" before it's insincere.

With, as you describe it, ""leaderless egalitarian organizations"", you can't have it both ways. You don't get to say ""Gamergate is what I as an individual say it is"" when you're also saying ""These individuals you are criticising are not true Gamergate"".

You're probably correct. It's not something I'm hugely knowlagable about, but at least it looks like the writing is on the wall for US dominance in world affairs. Probably not for a long time yet, perhaps well over 100 years, but it will happen I'm sure. Already it appears that in education and research, institutions in China and India are coming up to par with their western counterparts in some areas, and things like space programs are no longer the preserve of the world's only superpower.

false,osakanone,null,null,"No, I just know the majority of views on supply, demand and the way the market operates are hugely warped -- going doubly so for the movement of substances.

Libertarianism is incredibly flawed. But I'll get to that in a moment.

When you ban something, you put demand on it but also remove regulation. As a result, not only is the thing in question unregulated (and therefor becomes unsafe to the customer) you also drive up prices and incite illicit competitive practices like murdering your competition: In for a penny, in for a pound.

You can't actually stop people from getting the things they want. We've proven throughout history, particularly in Rome and more recently with the prohibation that people will get whatever they want and the only way to stop them from hurting themselves with it is to regulate the product.

While people on other drugs would die or dissappear, very high functioning people like doctors and politicians would go blind because of the bathtub bullshit chemestry they were drinking. That's very different to what we buy in bottles, isn't it? Now try to imagine the truth when I tell you that heroin -- yes, heroin -- is less harmful for your body than alcohol is per gram. While many drugs are dangerous because they're poorly manufactured or adulterated to save cost (which is supposedly what a libertarian thinks the market needs: The freedom for these people to do that) the results kill people. But clean heroin is better for you in every way than clean alcohol. And the same is actually true of 90% of drugs we ban.

Prior to the prohibition, most anything was legal. Drug consumption was at an all time low. It was banned because it was believed to affect the economy negatively. Following it, most of the over-dosage, misappropriation, shoddy product and gang-violence and other stuff we associate with drugs today were born. Alcohol, having a popular majority that were very vocal got their side of the act repealed while today politicians go to war with concepts and shower the public with platitudes in order to appeal to misconstructed social values of the lowest common denominator in order to win votes, rather than winning over actual legislation and politics.


In every country where drug use has been decriminalised, the consumption rates fall through the floor and associated deaths drop because profit-margins linked with the risk disappear and are no longer required, dis-empowering. Competition becomes healthy, with people trying to sell based on who actually has the better product, not who owns what territory. Even better, when taxed and regulated, it makes huge amounts of money which benefits the public good.

You might bring up addiction but addiction is a public health issue, not a criminal issue. When a policeman says your life will be ruined by drugs, what he actually means is ""I will ruin your life because you did drugs"", as if that person's problems were not bad enough already -- and that creates contempt with law enforcement.

Historically people in shitty situations will inebreate themselves on literally whatever they can get their hands on. Before coke and heroin hit the American ghetto, it was alcohol and whatever people could steal from pharmacies. 

Science has shown repeatedly that if you give people fufilling lives with prospects to rise up out of whatever shitstorm of circumstances they're buried, compressed, branded and indoctrinated into as a culture, they do -- and they drop their addictions and move onto better things. Unfortunately for many people, their prospects are shit. You could say ""Well why not just leave the ghetto?"" but that's physically impossible.

I am not a libertarian. While I think people should be free to make their own choices, I also think the free market is very dangerous because it lies to the consumers and allows for a shittier quality of product that will fuck us all over. When you let companies do what they want, they fuck us in the ass.

If you think letting people do what they want is dangerous, tell me why you think its dangerous and walk me through with some examples, rather than tl;dring my message or tutting your head and trying to ignore a very basic and fundamental human truth of our times.",0,1416584554,null,0,false,0,cm9022x,t3_2mz2nj,t1_cm9022x,t1_cm8zi6j,null,1425911009,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

There aren't leaders - they're not being told what to do as orders by these people; more like those people are acting in what GamerGate as a whole sees as good ideas, and get praised for it. Discussion, of course, goes both ways there. 

In any case, no individual can represent so many people as one. At best, a single person can provide a face to talk out of, and talk about the things GamerGate generally stands for, but it's stupid to act as if that person is the embodiment of all those people - I think it's just a way for you to get more ammo.

So if Labour collapsed, it was some time between 2005 and 2010, and they did exactly as well (to the nearest percentage point) in the recent by-election as someone would have predicted from their 2010 polling.

A contract meant stability to the team's owners/managers, and it meant loyalty to the fanbase. When these things are broken, it has real consequences that affect the club in really meaningful ways. 

Consider these two scenarios:

1. Bale signs a five year contract. AVB and Levy can now plan on a world-class player being on the team, we can build a team strategy and personnel (who are more likely to come when he is there) around him, and have a plan for the next few seasons going forward. More likely than not, there will be some forward movement (and when you're only 1 point away from CL this is a huge deal).There is stability in the team, it can grow, and the fans have a global star to rally around. Bale maybe then leaves after year five, but if we're a CL team (not of the caliber of Madrid, but still, we're there), maybe not. If he does leave, though - its done in the ""right"" way and Spurs will be in a really good situation - more $ b/c of CL, better players b/c we're in the CL and a bigger global fanbase (more $ yet again).

2. Bale signs a five year contract, but leaves after year one. Any plans AVB/Levy had are essentially out the window and we have to start from scratch. Meanwhile smarter teams out there have stability and are continuing to get better, leaving us behind. Bale breaking a contract and leaving cripples the club for at least a couple of seasons.

They have no obligation to pay into your preferred pension scheme, and there is a cast-iron reason why. Imagine being the payroll administrator of an employer, and having to manage as many different pension schemes as you had employees - it would be a nightmare.

The Aviva GPP will almost certainly have a range of potential investments, which you can self-select from, and their fund range is generally pretty good. You can absolutely build a decent portfolio from any modern GPP arrangement.

You will only receive your employer's contribution if you agree to join their pension. It is a seriously poor financial decision to turn this down. If, for example, they contribute 3% of your salary in exchange for you contributing 5% gross (4% after basic rate tax relief), then by comparison to opting out and continuing your SIPP, your GPP will receive 60% more in contributions.

you won't have forgotten how to ride, it's just a confidence thing.. soon as you start riding again it'll come back - you were happy and comfortable on a YBR before, that won't have changed.

One thing I would say is that even if the Fazer wasn't the right bike for you, you shouldn't consign youself to a 125 for ever, once you've got your confidence back there are loads of bikes you could go to that would be great for you.. going on seat height for example a Ducati Monster 600 is only an inch or so taller in the seat than a YBR.

If you're really concerned about going to see the bike on your own is there no-one at all who could give you a lift there / act as support for you? doesn't have to be a biker friend to check the bike over, just someone else to be there with you.. how are you planning to get the bike home if you're going solo.. public transport to the seller then ride back?

As to condition of the bike and checking it over I think other people have said all this but: check exhaust when you arrive to see if it's hot, look for evidence of crashes - scratches, aftermarket indicators, cracks in the fairings and such.. can you push it around easily enough (i.e. no nasty sticking wheels or brakes, handlebars turn easily enough and look straight), right mount of clean oil in the engine, does it warm up ok and tick over evenly once warm..

Main thing, you need to take it for a test-ride, if something is wonked on it it'll be far more obvious whilst riding it.

Also, attitude of the seller, if they're not willing to work with you around checking the bike over, or if you feel intimidated or pressured to buy, just walk away, he's not selling a one-of-a-kind rare commodity, there are others, there will be others, you're doing him a favour coming to see his bike!

It's political economics.  The wider the UKIP appeal becomes, the more moderate it becomes.  Tories went through it, Labour went through it, Lib Dems went through it to a lesser degree.  But all major parties started out as a niche and grew to encompass a wide diversity of issues.


This is what UKIP is going through now,  they're in the process of shedding the racist viewpoint and moderating themselves.  

That's what the main problem is for the other parties,  they can no longer just say ""A vote for UKIP is wasted, or you're voting in a racist"" it's because UKIP now stand for more than ""No Immigration"", they realise immigration is required to fill the skills gap and are going ""We want a points based policy such as Australia""  


Thats the problem,  maybe not this election, but the one after that they will build their party, build their support and eventually gain meaningful status.

false,q_pop,null,null,"/u/notnotcitricsquid has taken a stab at the benefits side, but I can give you some clarity about the inheritance tax situation.

Your grandfather is gifting your mother approximately £12,000 per year.

This kind of gift is known as a [""potentially exempt transfer""](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/pass-money-property/exempt-gifts.htm#4), and no inheritance tax is due unless the donor (your grandfather) dies within 7 years.

If he does die within 7 years of the most recent gift there *may* be inheritance tax to pay.

First of all, your grandfather has a £3,000 PA ""[general exemption](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/pass-money-property/exempt-gifts.htm#2)"" for inheritance tax purposes, meaning that *if these are the only gifts he is giving* this would reduce the possible PET to £9,000.

In addition, if your grandfather could be shown to have been making [regular gifts out of his income, and his quality of life is not suffering](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ihtmanual/ihtm14231.htm), the entire gift is inheritance tax free.

In addition to this, he will have an inheritance tax ""nil rate band"" of £325,000, meaning the sum of all considered gifts in the previous 7 years plus the value of his estate can be worth this before any IHT is due. The Nil rate band is deducted from ""lifetime gifts"" before the estate value too, which helps.

If there *is* IHT to pay on PETs, there is something called [taper relief](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/how-to-value-estate/gifts.htm#4), meaning that after three years the tax due reduces.

In the absolute worst case scenario, *some* tax may be due on death, in relation to the gifts, but only if:

* The gift couldn't have been shown to be ""normal expenditure""
* Your grandfather had used up his IHT nil rate band of £325,000 before the gifts in question were given
* After exemptions and taper relief there was still a taxable amount

In this very unlikely scenario the tax would be due *on your mother*, not on your grandfather's estate, and awkwardly would need to be paid before the estate could gain probate, so it is worth some consideration relating to the likelihood.

You mean like [the one that already exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points-based_immigration_system_%28United_Kingdom%29), and has existed since 2008?

&gt; Therefore if the NHS is in constant need of people with certain skills to fill vacancies, people with said skills would find themselves able to migrate here with ease.

Sort of. Actually, right now, the government are trying to limit the number of non-UK graduates moving into the medical profession by severely restricting access to work permits for postgraduate doctors and dentists in training, *specifically* to give UK and EU young people a start in the medical field. 

And even then, the NHS can only sponsor workers after undergoing considerable effort to prove that no UK or EU national could fill that role, which is a seriously difficult task. The only exception is for **jobs that are listed on the skilled shortage list**, which is updated and maintained by the independent Migration Advisory Committee. So a mechanism already exists to let in people in areas of severe shortage within the NHS, and that can *still* only be undertaken if they are the best possible applicant for a job. [Here's what the MAC said in their most recent report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257241/mac-report.pdf) (2013, 4.5):

&gt; The numbers using the shortage occupation list as a route for entry under Tier 2 are relatively small. Only around 3,100 in-and out of country Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS) were issued under the shortage occupation list route in the year to end September 2012, compared with just under 51,000 CoS issued under Tier 2 (General) and the intra-company transfer route combined. 

After that, skip to Chapter 5 on page 83 for a full view of the CoS shortages with regards to the health sector.

Better yet, let's go ahead and look at Ukip's official policies listed on their website:

&gt; Regain control of our borders and of immigration - only possible by leaving the EU. 

I'm not really sure how one follows the other, but fine. This seems to be implying that the UK Border Agency cannot exist due to some edict from Brussels, when the UK actually opted out of Schengen and thus has **complete control of all of its borders for all travellers inbound from every country except the Republic of Ireland**. They also seem to be deliberately conflating the issue of border security and immigration. Sure, people from the EU/EEA can do *almost* anything they want in the UK, but they still absolutely have to go through immigration and customs whenever they arrive in the UK (and I would know - I'm Croatian and still under transitional arrangements, so I get a mini-inquisition every time I enter the UK to make sure that I'm definitely doing what I should be).

&gt; Immigrants must financially support themselves and their dependents for 5 years. This means private health insurance (except emergency medical care), private education and private housing - they should pay into the pot before they take out of it. 

Fuck that. I pay taxes and NI like everyone else. No. No self-respecting country should discriminate against one group of people just because the majority wills it so. One system for all people, with everyone held to the same standard. Isn't that the definition of a 'fair go'?

This is to say nothing of the fact that migrants as a whole tend to be much younger and healthier than the general population. Also, a substantial proportion of migrants have no access to social housing anyway. I live in the same extortionate private housing as everyone else since. And private education? Fuck off with you and your money-grubbing mates with personal interest in the private education sector. By all means, segregate immigrants from the general population even more. That'll achieve your goals.

Furthermore, from their 'Policies for People' page, they state:

&gt; UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for **all UK residents**.

Mmmkay. If you've been issued a visa for non-tourism purposes (for example, Limited Leave to Remain), then you're considered resident in the UK typically either as soon as you arrive (to study or take a job, for example), OR after 12 months. Different institutions seem to draw slightly different limits, neither of what Ukip seems to think is considered a 'UK resident'. I wonder what their definition is?

&gt; A points-based visa system and time-limited work permits. 

PBS has existed for eight years. And time-limited work permits? They're ALL TIME LIMITED. What do they think this is, the fucking 19th century?

But then, on another page, they say:

&gt; We will extend to EU citizens **the existing points-based system** for time-limited work permits.

What? There's already a points-based system? WELL DONE, LADS! ELECTION PROMISE KEPT, AND WE'RE NOT EVEN IN GOVERNMENT! Next promise: we will ensure that London is still called London!

&gt; Proof of private health insurance must be a precondition for immigrants and tourists to enter the UK. 

I've already made my thoughts about migrants requiring private health insurance well-known above. With regards to tourists, this is again conflating several issues:

EU countries have reciprocal health care agreements that ensure that all travellers can receive emergency medical treatment like local residents can no matter where they are. In addition, the UK has several bilateral agreements with non-EU countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several others. 

However, there are no bilateral agreements for the US, for example, even though Americans qualify for visa-free tourism access. This would be difficult to implement from a logistical perspective, but sure, why not - anyone applying for a tourist visa (if you're from a country that requires it) needs to show evidence of private medical insurance.

Also, it should be noted that the NHS *shouldn't* treat foreign visitors/tourists except in the cases of emergency medical treatment for injuries sustained whilst in the UK. Treatment for pre-existing conditions will be done, but you'll be handed a bill at the end of it (or at least you should be). That area gets rather complicated, and a lot of hospitals haven't billed foreign tourists for things they technically should have paid for. One of the arguments you hear a lot from the health care sector is that it would save the country so little money that it would likely be more expensive to enforce the rules than to have an entire department dedicated to collections trying to chase up a bloke from Indonesia who had a recurring bout of shingles and required a few days of treatment whilst visiting his friend in Sheffield.

Finally, to borrow a quote from your post:

&gt; Of course this rant has absolutely nothing to do with actual UKIP policy but everything to do with Labour trying to ""scaremonger"" (to use an SNP term) the only way they know how, by claiming the NHS is going to implode if they do not govern the country.

On the contrary, everything I've described above is Ukip trying to scaremonger people who know nothing about immigration policy by either conflating the rules applied to EU or non-EU nationals to the other group, or to all migrants as a whole, or by simply outright lying about what current policy is, in order to sell themselves as a party who will address issues **that have already been addressed**. By trying to give out the impression that the UK has no control over its borders, or that all visitors can use the NHS whenever they want, or that there's no points-based system, or any other number of absolutely ridiculous and downright false claims, they're trying even harder to claw that white van man onto their side by playing into prejudices instead of actual facts. And it's not even over topics of the environment, or economic policy - **it's about other people**. An entire subsection of society being demonised for political purposes, whose lives have meaning, and who have their own ambitions, all tarred with the same misrepresented brush. 

Ukip can fuck right off.

He's their best player but that doesn't mean he's having a positive impact on the club, there's a very good chance that replacing him would actually help them a lot right now. Being cup tied doesn't really matter for Dortmund who basically have no chance of continuing much deeper but desperately need a boost in the league where Schurrle could make an impact whereas for Chelsea it's tough to see how often Schurrle would even play at this point, Willian would always be favoured and with Reus for League games he's also unlikely to get injured. The whole idea seems to be that if Chelsea get in early then Dortmund are getting more money than the release clause which can be reinvested to help them out of a tough spot and Chelsea secure the services of Reus without having to battle it out in the summer free-for-all. 

I'm not saying it's likely but it makes a lot of sense from both perspectives. It wouldn't be stupid for either side, Chelsea would be stupid to give up a chance to get Reus, even if he was a little more expensive than he might be later he's a quality player and better than Schurrle is even on top form which he really isn't and BVB would be stupid to give up the additional money and services of a great alternative player for a few additional months of Reus.

If we are still of the mentality of feeling lucky to have any truly elite player, then I fail to see how we will ever leave the current second-tier we are in. 

Consider Ryan Mason becoming a top 10 player in the world in the next couple of years. In 2016 we are getting great again (truly fighting for CL spots), he signs a five year contract, but we all know he's going to leave. Mason, the player our team is probably built around (if he's that good) leaves, other great talent doesn't want to come because he (and our CL-chances) are gone, and we are then back to where we are now? Am I happy because I was lucky enough to see Mason in a Spurs jersey, even though my club (which matters a whole lot more than any one player) is stuck spinning its wheels since Modric left years ago? No, I'm not.

I'd honestly rather not have these elite players, but rather some ""good but not quite Madrid good"" players so we can become a real team, significantly better as a unit over our individual pieces, instead of going through this crap in an endless cycle.

I'd rather have Dawson bleeding Spurs, honoring his contract, fighting for his spot on the team than a revolving door of players using Tottenham as a stepping stone for their own benefits. A team of Dawsons will beat a team of mercenaries often enough, and I'll be a whole hell of a lot prouder of them regardless of outcome.

Chinese seamen would settle in port towns in England to start business. Hell, in 1892, an Indian man was elected as an MP, and before that one of our footballers was from Ghana.

And even before the empire, to claim we were a monoculture without immigration is ridiculous.

I got a job in the field I wanted, sure, but that has nothing to do with my degree - I hadn't even got my grades when I got the offer, and the company didn't ask about them anyway. I'd have literally had the same benefit if I'd stayed at home for the time I was at university.

false,rydleo,null,null,"It's quite simple really- will Mario be taking penalties here?  Probably not.  He might get the occasional free kick though.  Added to which the award of free kicks and penalties are outside his control and not something he can largely control himself and they also create a skewed impression of how effective someone is at goal scoring.  I might, for example, look at Gerrard last season and see someone who scored 13 goals and think 'wow, he should be a striker' when reality is 10 of those were penalties, 2 from free kicks, and only 1 from open play which tells a bit of a different story, no?

Taking Mario in detail, he had 7 goals from open play all last season in Serie A, 5 the half season before at Milan, and 1 the half season before at City.  So, 13 open play goals in over  4,000 minutes played, or roughly a similar amount of open play goals to what an 18/19 year old Sterling had in the same amount of time played.  How is that anything but a relatively average goal scoring record for a striker?

  Added to which his non-penalty conversion is awful- again 7 open play goals with 140+ shots taken.  That's simply abysmal and well below average for a striker (Sturridge, by comparison, had 21 open play goals last season alone with only 99 shots, which is ridiculously good and up amongst the best in Europe).

He's not inconsistent, he's simply not as good as some seem think.  Loads of people have the 'technical and physical attributes' to be world class, that doesn't mean anything at all.   All I'm saying is be realistic with your expectations and simply it isn't helpful for Mario for people to keep bigging him up like he's going to light the league on fire.  He is who he is and provides what he'll provide, which is probably something in the 8-12 goal a season range, not the 20-30 goal a season range of a top class striker like Sturridge.  I see the same nonsense being done on Origi right now where people are screaming for him to come and it's very unfair to the kid as he simply isn't likely to have much impact at all if we did bring him in and then disillusionment will set in.

I would do the same thing, because I care about myself the most. I get it.

But my actual initial point was ""I've never understood the love that continues to flow for Bale.""

If I left my job after signing a contract my fellow coworkers (closest equivalent to fans I guess) would all say I did what was in my best interest, yes. They would also say fuck that guy because I left them in a shitstorm to now deal with. They wouldn't constantly talk about how I'm the best and how much they loved me and damn what an honor it was to have me as part of the company for a while. I think they'll see the mess that they now have to deal with every single day as a result of me leaving and be pretty annoyed about it. Bar in mind, this is if I signed a contract with my employer. If I'm work for hire (as almost everyone is), then this doesn't apply.

Its just weird (to me) how this for some reason hasn't transitioned to the fans of our club, as (I think) its basically the same thing. Bale fucked us by leaving. He may have done what was the logical thing for him, and anyone would probably do it, but the reality is we are in a way worse position because of it and I'm not going to sign the guy's praises after the fact.

They should have never appointed BR without a top class DoF on top of the club keeping an eye on everything.  The job is just too big with too much money involved for any singular entity, particular a person not used to dealing with hundreds of millions of pounds in revenue, footballers making £5M+ per year, and literally hundreds of employees and multiple divisions to coordinate with.  If BR was unwilling to work under those circumstances, then so be it and he'll never get the Real or Barca job he seems to crave.

At this point little can be done about the overall situation, but if I were FSG I would be speaking with potential DoFs and simply appoint one over Rodgers and then disband the committee.

It is largely to do with obtaining the correct tax relief, and ensuring that the tax relief is accurately noted and reconciled with payroll software/HMRC. The introduction of real-time reporting and auto enrolment have effectively rendered individual pension arrangements horribly complicated for all but the smallest of employers. We have definitely seen a trend in our corporate clients of stopping any previously agreed arrangements in light of auto enrolment.

Another issue is that even if the company did agree to pay into your pension, they would still be obliged to automatically enrol you into their pension scheme, and would have no legal recourse if you decided to pick up both contributions. This has effectively been the final nail in the coffin.

Effectively, company contributions *generally* made gross, where-as (for personal arrangements like SIPPs and GPPs) employee contributions are made net of 20% tax relief.

However, employee contributions are sometimes made gross too, depending on the arrangement (The People's Pension, for example, allows this due to its legal structure), and when salary sacrifice is used (very popular with larger employers) the entire contribution must be made by the employer, which can further complicate things.

On an individual level, pensions seem pretty simple, but scale up to many more than a handful of employees and anything anomalous takes disproportionate time and effort (and cost) to administrate.

Queen is always a good way to go, the Beatles have a lot of widespread appeal and a safe bet sometimes but not always, you can also go for stuff like Outkast and Nirvana and tunes that has a good chance of appealing to a wide audience. Classic rock is always a good way to go, and stuff like James Brown is a killer. There's the nostalgia angle too, occasionally go for old obscure hits that tug at people's nostalgia strings, but depends on the age group you're performing for 

Most important thing is familiarity, if people don't know the song they won't react. They like things they know the words to and can sing along with, but finding artists with universal appeal is tricky. Find a song they love that's also obscure or unexpected and they go wild! 

My picks would be stuff like Queen, the Beatles, Bowie, Nirvana, Prince, Michael Jackson, songs that have widespread appeal and are classic hits or cult classics. I've done songs from film sound tracks before like Quentin Tarantino films. Play that lapdance tune from Death Proof or songs from Kill Bill and people love it! They like it when you play songs they know, especially obscure songs they don't expect, which makes it extra hard to please 

Just think about classic tunes from various time periods and genras that everyone loves and appeals to various age brackets but don't be afraid to shock or surprise and think outside the box and play obscure music, even things like cheesy old theme songs or holiday songs can rouse a pub like nothing else if you do it right  ",0,1416588615,null,0,1416589304,0,cm923re,t3_2mz5v6,t1_cm923re,t1_cm8yori,null,1425910054,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Yes, he has made a few runs the past few games. He's finally learning how a striker is meant to play but it's taking him ages. You don't make a run as a striker as if it's your god given right to get the ball from it. The first and foremost aim from making a run is for a defender to see you and realise if a good ball is played, he could be in. The defender has to go with him. Let's say that's down the outside of a centre back. All of a sudden, we've got a nice pocket of space as the centre backs are a little stretched for a second and there's a bit of room in front of the one that just got pulled away. Glen Johnson on the right wing all of a sudden doesn't have to make a shit attempt at cutting inside to try murder a child in row Z. He can play an easy ball into someone like Coutinho who goes into that bit of space. Coutinho can take a touch without someone immediately on top of him and maybe something can happen. The whole point is to stop the defence being so rigid and set in stone. You need to take them out of their comfortable formation and positions if you want to score anything other than a wonder goal.



Let's even disregard this fact. You still can't paint a picture where he's done any way decent. His shooting is absolutely atrocious. It's worse than Coutinho's was up until recently.

While that is probably true, it's not David Allen Green, from what I know. He is well known on the skeptics and legal blogging scene. It was [he who defended the guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Joke_Trial#High_Court_appeal) who made a joke about bombing Nottingham airport, for example.

He [founded Westminster Skeptics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_Green#Activism) *precisely* to keep an eye on the establishment and point out the dodgy things it does.

* John 'Obi Trice' Mikel is back and healthy
* Diego, Schurrle and Fabregas are all back with the first team and healthy. Cesc is still a little iffy though.
* Ramires is fit to play but not at 100%. He is improving.
* Jose says that complacency won't be an issue. We will lose games because of not being good enough and ""football being football.""
* We now have 8 games in 24 days. Jose says he is ready to manage his men and will take it one game at a time. First up: West Brom.
* ""Football is football.""
* Jose acknowledges that we are entering a new phase in the season. The density and frequency of matches is at it's peak so training and rest days will be scarce. Matches will take priority. Jose emphasizes that everyone in England is going through this, so the teams in multiple competitions will have the worst of it. He says he loves this stretch of the season but sympathizes with the players and the effect on their bodies.
* Jose trolls the reporter that asks about Cech leaving/staying. *""On which mickey mouse website, homey?""*
* Jose says he has **zero** offers for Cech. He adds that Petr is a big professional and not once has he approached Jose about his discomfort or desire to leave the club.
* Jose doesn't want to make any comments about the crowd and their support.
* Jose expects a win this weekend, as always, but does not expect it to be easy.
* Jose believes that the recent rest period for Diego will be huge, but at the same time he knows that Diego is going through the English holiday season for the first time. The frequency of fixtures will be something new to him. Jose adds that Diego has the mental and physical resilience to go through the upcoming marathon, but again ""football is football.""
* Jose again says that he will be operating match to match. Diego is on 4 yellow cards, but he will play every match until he gets his 5th. When he gets his 5th, we will adjust.
* Jose says Diego Costa is ***fearless***.
* Jose says he doesn't compare us to others, he just worries about points and winning the next match. *""This game is and always will be about buckets.... or, err, points rather.""*
* Jose says he does not think forward about our match against the top third of the table (Southampton in December, City in December). He worries about the next match.
* Couldn't make out what the Portuguese reporter asked first. Something about January's transfer window I think?
* Jose is asked about the Portuguese National Team. He says the 3 points against Armenia were vital. He didn't watch the friendly against Argentina because Jose does not like friendlies.
* Jose underlines Didier's influence. It's part of the reason they brought him back at his age.
* Regarding the West Brom fixture last year: ***Football is football***.
* Jose says that at this moment, Chelsea can end up in the Europa league. Nothing is certain at this stage and we cannot worry about other teams' results. The first objective is to advance to the last 16 of the CL and that is the main focus.

In the spirit of proving just how lazy this is, here's my list as far as I can write in the next ten minutes....aaaannnddd GO:

1. *The format+Premise* A wonderfully odd premise allows for each story to be part of an over-arching narative with some reoccuring characters but completely new settings, characters, plots, and tone. The setting of Doctor Who is **EVERY SETTING**

2. *The ability to constantly reinvent itself.* Most shows are confined by their main characters and themes. Doctor Who regularly switches out its main characters through the use of companions and is not beyond having major revisions of even the main and only constant character. 

3. *The Doctor Himself* A character both simple and complex. The ever changing, but strangly constant main character provides an anchor to the show...most of the time. From the grumpy but playful grandfather, to the imposing and forceful cosmic hobo, to the goofy hero, to the intense antihero, from the wise oldman, to the manic stage performer, to the awestruck child, he is always a scientist, a learner, and an adventurer, passing through, helping out... and being strangly inspirational along the way. 

4. *Variety and impermance of companions* Sometimes we have Leela pulling a knife on a stranger, sometimes its Sarah Jane giggling at an explosion, sometimes Clara crying while holding her own against a gruesome villian. These characters serve as a bridge for the view and its difficult to not get attachted to them even knowing their time will end... except for Adric. Fuck Adric.

5. *A Sci-fi Institution* Star Trek might be famous for giving us the Borg, but Doctor Who had people turning themselves into cyborgs with a hivemind and telling people the futility of their resistance ages before hand. Its a natural consequence of being a part of pop culture for so long, the ideas start to crop up again in other works.  There's a reason Bill and Ted time-travel in that phone-booth.

6. *A UK Institution"" Quick, what show has had Monty Python cameos, had Douglas Adams as a writer, and featured an unholy number of well known UK actors? Yep, not to mention the massive emphasis on the history of that damp little island. Doctor Who is more British than the Queen.

I'm interested to see why you believe we have no clout? As I understand we receive proportional representation in the EU and get a fair say on what does and doesn't pass, which would be infinitely more so than if we were to withdraw from the EU. 

&gt;We have service and engineering 'wealth'.

They aren't really comparable. The kind of services that spin us money are very much reliant on international markets, and we don't *really* have vast engineering wealth. Gas is notoriously easy to sell. 

Besides, this argument would also apply to pretty much every other EU member state. We are all very much interdependent. If the argument was likely to produce a better outcome, I'm sure more member states would be making moves towards an exit. As it stands in the UK (generally, you yourself haven't voiced these reasons), the current push for an exit comes from arguments about immigration policy rooted in xenophobia, I haven't seen a sound economic case for EU withdrawal; in fact the vast majority of businesses here are opposed to it.

I made no claims as to the rate of immigration. I expressed no opinions on that matter, did not discuss it in any way, nor did I express any opinion either way on the subject of the UK remaining in the EU.

You can try to shift the subject to culture and net migration to make an appeal to emotion, but that's not what I was talking about. I specifically addressed several Ukip claims **about how the immigration system works, not how it should work**. Claims that are demonstrably false.

But in the spirit of competition, and actually adding facts to this thread rather than spouting off meaningless party soundbites, I'll address your claims as well.

&gt; Well, no. UKIP wants to reduce the rate of immigration.

Sure they do. They're not alone. So do the Tories. Labour and the Lib Dems have been suspiciously silent as a party on this issue, with random MPs giving their own opinions. I never argued that Ukip didn't want to reduce immigration. Just that they grossly misstate how the immigration system works, and how their so-called plans either reflect current realities that are already in place, or hugely misrepresent the realities of immigration.

&gt; Since the rate of immigration is far higher than it has ever been, this is not necessarily stupid. 

No it's not. It's certainly higher than at most points since 2008 (second highest apart from 2010 it looks), but higher than it's ever been?

First of all, I'll be using an ONS chart that details net migration, ie the number of people coming in less the number of people going out. That more accurately reflects the burden placed on public services.

[Here's their most recent estimate that covers up to the end of Q3 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/chdltmigrationestimates_tcm77-354471.png). There's no data more recent than that.

Right off the bat I can see that 2004, 2007 and 2010 were all higher than the 2013 *estimate*. This correlates nicely with the introduction of the much more stringent Points-Based System in 2008 and the caps on Tier 2 visas and elimination of Post-Study Work visas in 2011. According to the ONS, the more recent spikes are largely a leadup to the end of transitional arrangements against Bulgarian and Romanian nationals on 1 January 2014. They state:

&gt; The increase in net migration is due to the combined effect of a slight increase in immigration and a slight decrease in emigration, neither of which were statistically significant changes.

&gt; Non-EU citizens accounted for 46% of immigration to the UK in the year ending September 2013, with EU citizens accounting for 39% and British citizens 15%. The recent patterns in total net migration have been affected by changes in migration flows between EU citizens and non-EU citizens.

&gt; Immigration of EU citizens (excluding British citizens) to the UK in the year ending September 2013 was 209,000, the highest estimate on record and a statistically significant increase from 149,000 the previous year. Emigration of EU citizens from the UK remained broadly similar over the same period, meaning that net migration of EU citizens doubled to 131,000, a statistically significant increase from 65,000 the previous year.

&gt; Conversely, there was a statistically significant decrease in immigration of non-EU citizens to 244,000 in the year ending September 2013 from 269,000 the previous year. Net migration of non-EU citizens has experienced a slight (but not statistically significant) fall to 141,000 from 160,000 the previous year.

There are still no hard numbers for 2014 at all, but [this slightly hysterical article from The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11060653/Net-migration-soars-in-new-blow-for-Coalition-pledge.html) indicates that this year is likely to be highest again due to Bulgarians and Romanians. I'm really looking forward to seeing the official stats for 2014 net, which will probably be published at some point next year.

So most of this immigration is being driven by the EU and British citizens returning to the UK, whereas non-EU numbers continue to fall. That's as to be expected, *because non-EU immigration is about the only thing that can actually be affected by policy*. If the changes to EU migration are enough to make you want to withdraw from the EU entirely, then fine. That's your choice. At least now you know what the numbers look like.

&gt; A desire for only gradual change of the ethnic and cultural composition of the UK is, again, not obviously stupid. 

I never said it was. 

&gt; I seem to recall that different cultural communities in the Balkans had some community relations problems not long ago. Where different communities live separately but side by side, there are often potential problems.

Ask 300 people in the Balkans of their view on the subject and you'll get 400 different reasons about what happened. The conflict began as a largely political issue (mainly started by Serbia) over the power vacuum left by the death of Tito and the collapse of Yugoslavia. Serbia got hungry for some greater control over former Yugoslav territories and everyone else fought back. Different religions and cultures that had lived together in peace for generations were encouraged to use bigoted and racially motivated propaganda to drive up war efforts in each country, and the least educated amongst them did so with great pride, a terrible thing that persists until the present. What happened was disgraceful, and even if I think that the Serbian puppermasters were responsible for pulling the pin on the grenade, everyone shares some part of the blame for how it progressed. Nationalism and national pride, propagating hatred of the 'other' on all sides, is a direct consequence AND result of poor post-war economic conditions for all involved. Youth unemployment in most of the former Yugoslavia is shockingly high. But for 20 years now, most of those countries have been run by the military men who fought that war - despicable, self-serving, right-wing nationalists who sold their countries out to their mates, giving them control of state enterprises for token sums of $1, letting their countries fall into disrepair, and silencing all criticism with evocations of religion, national heroes and mythology. See what I'm getting at?

The Scots and the English fought for centuries. What ever happened to that?

&gt; Why should Britain have a deliberate policy of encouraging a high rate of immigration, with the result that different communities segregate in our cities?

Britain has no such policy. Perhaps before 2007 it did, and Blair in particular was quite keen on raising immigration rates in the late '90s and early '00s. 

Cameron's policy has been, since 2011, [to ""reduce net migration to the tens of thousands""](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/14/david-cameron-immigration-speech-full-text). Surely you've heard this before. They're been parroting this line on television for years now. 

Official government policy is [""securing borders and reducing immigration""](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/securing-borders-and-reducing-immigration/activity). Even the very conservative think-tank [Migration Watch UK states](http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/what-is-the-problem):

&gt; The UK now has a governing party committed to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. This is the first time that a government has had an explicit policy to reduce net migration, although it is increasingly clear that this objective is unlikely to be met by the end of this Parliament. 

&gt; While non-EU net migration has fallen by a third since the present government came to power, EU migration has increased significantly and is now almost at a similar level to non-EU migration. 

&gt; In order to achieve the necessary reductions in net migration it is imperative that this and any future government seeks in some way **to limit EU migration which is presently substantial but remains beyond the control of any government**. Action on out of work benefits will have only limited effect as most EU migrants come to work. Action on in work benefits such as working tax credit, housing benefit and child tax credit could be helpful but, even once benefits are excluded, the take home pay of migrants from poorer EU countries remains a multiple of what they would receive at home. **Some, at least temporary, modification to the principle of free movement of labour in Europe may prove to be essential**. [emphasis mine]

Therefore:

* Britain has no such policy to encourage immigration. In fact, the exact opposite is true and has been explicitly true since Cameron became PM in 2010.

* The driving force behind immigration at the moment is inflow from the EU, *which is beyond the control of the government*. The only way to change this is to get all EU countries to agree to modify the principles of the freedom of movement, or to withdraw from the EU entirely. Whether or not you believe this is a wise decision is a matter for you to decide.

&gt; Not all immigrant communities are integrating happily into our society.

Let's see now. If the harassment is so constant, I'd like you to provide evidence that shows a constant stream of harassment. Secondly, any death threats people have received, I'd like you to prove who it actually was.

We'll let people decide if it's untrue. Poisoning the well before people read it isn't a good idea.

Here's another post of leaked emails between editors, senior editors and writers who are talking about black balling another journalist. To those that don't know what that means: they are trying to actively keep someone from gaining employment—because the journalist in question revealed a scam for donation— that was in violation of the TOS for the fundraising site. Keeping people from gaining employment and conspiring to do so is illegal.

The information is not present in the article, I mean the actual details of the scam that was revealed by the journalist. Somebody set up a fund raiser for themselves. They claimed they were in a car accident and a piece of metal was left in their body, even after surgery. But it was really a fundraiser for a sex change operation, which goes against TOS. Some people ""in the community"", which is stated in the article, weren't happy and the girl threatened to kill herself.

When I say they're not going deeper, I don't mean they won't make it out of the group stages, I mean that they will lose against the first moderately difficult team they encounter. Look at who those 4 matches were against, an underperforming Arsenal with multiple defensive injuries at home was their hardest match, doing well in that group doesn't prove anything, especially in conjunction with their frankly abysmal league season.

To your point about the wings, you fail to consider that Mourinho often favours a 4-3-3 in bigger matches which would free up Oscar to play on the wing if needed. You also might consider that Willian will be much less of an injury risk if Reus is playing most of the league games as he'd obviously be seeing less play time and thus have much less time to actually pick up an injury. Even if he did, the team has played both Ramires and Luis on the wings so far this season so there are back ups who can play if absolutely required. The right wing position isn't even close to the biggest weakness, losing Oscar, Matic, Fabregas or any of the defenders for an extended period would be worse than losing Schurrle given he's second choice to Willian anyway and his form is incredibly rough with no improvement in sight. Presumably Piazon could also be called back from loan in January (at a team not in European competition) if a back up was incredibly necessary.

If the team makes a move for Reus now it will be because they *can't* make the same move in summer.

**Price of product:** £4 for 125ml (includes muslin cloth)

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on half price offer

**Product claims:** *""B. Revealed with this gentle glycolic cleansing peel to leave skin looking and feeling expertly clean, fresh and smooth. Dull dead skin cells are softened and buffed away to help reveal a more youthful-looking complexion. Contains glycolic acid exfoliant, soothing cocoa and shea butters and a polishing muslin cloth, to help encourage a brighter, healthier, more radiant complexion.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea.  Purchased because I wanted a comparison to the Boots No.7 cleansing balm.

Note that I was previously using a muslin cloth with a light lotion cleanser.  

**Your opinion:** I feel 'meh' about the B. line, the ingredients don't wow me for the price point (on par with Boots No.7). Furthermore the pH is wrong for exfoliating hence including in this category.

This cleansing cream rinses completely clean with water and the muslin cloth (sturdier than those supplied with Superdrug's Hot Cloth Cleansers). It is barely scented and haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction, but I definitely need to follow quite quickly with a serum or moisturiser or my skin tightens up a little.

IMO this is suitable for any skin type except very dry skin. I have given away the remainder and will not repurchase.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, betaine, cetyl esters, sorbitan stearate, stearyl alcohol, cocoa butter, cetyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, shea butter, glycolic acid, polyacrylamide, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, C13-14 isoparaffin, fragrance, allantoin, xanthan gum, laureth-7, capryl hydroxyamic acid, disodium EDTA, methylpropanediol, limonene, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional.""*

I think that those in GG need to elect leaders and choose representative instead of those prominent people coming forward being assumed to be leaders as they can be without being vetted not particularly suitable for their movement. I find in general that to be a huge problem with these types of movements from the student protests, [including those recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEenmWjdcXo), and the occupy movements and beyond. 

In these movements it is a known quantity that 'black bloc' members cause damage and riot. However they are not representing the vast majority who come to protest. A couple of my sister's friends were the ones arrested trying to storm Westminster. Silly buggers. But they don't represent nor the other seven arrests. Their movement is what is on their banners not in their most vocal and extremes actions. If they had leadership and a manifesto it would be different and in my opinion more successful.

I think GG are attempting to write a manifesto, I am not sure on the details or what they call it, but they refuse to have leaders, sadly for them celebrities and internet personalities dominate the conversation as they always do and not all are decent people.

false,breezehair,null,null,"Thank you for your detailed description of the immigration system (which, as a national, I was of course hazy about... :) ). 

Thank you also for the link to the ONS net immigration and emigration statistics: it is interesting. 

And I should apologise for sarcastically implying you held opinions that you did not express...

However, I would make three points in response to your very careful post -- you obviously know a lot about this subject. 

First, the ONS graph shows some recent fluctuations, but net immigration is still close to all time highs.  (By all time, I mean all time during our recorded history...)  The Conservatives have trumpeted their intention to reduce it, but as you point out their policies have mostly affected the people that we should be letting in.

Second, within current EU treaties, indeed we have no options.  Cameron has managed to complain and antagonise other EU nations without actually taking any decision to renegotiate.  I doubt that it benefits the rest of the EU that so much of their enterprising youth make their way to London; the movement is so large and so asymmetric that a renegotiation on free movement would surely succeed. The Eurozone's policy failures are so large, and the movement so asymmetric, that they are in no position to object. 

Third, I am not sure how much of the current immigration policy is the result of the last Labour government, but encouraging immigration was surely deliberate immediately they came to power. (Hey, I voted for them, and I feel I know how they thought.) Much of the motivation was of course to import more Labour voters. Now that is not cricket. 

As you point out, the number of 'illegals' and overstays is unknown and only vague estimates seem to be available. I am mystified at the government's ineffectiveness here -- do you understand it? 

I suspect the main reason is that senior politicians and civil servants feel remote from this issue, and they decided to declare it a policy priority without actually doing anything either desirable or effective. 

A head of political steam is building up.  I really wish it wasn't -- the problem could have been solved earlier. It's not the only head of steam building in Europe now: the EU treaties are by no means set in stone. The UK's negotiating position would be strong, the requests reasonable, and retaliatory action would be self-destructive for countries in the Eurozone.

Its a similar system to how Mancini played when we had 3 at the back for actual match context and that was to put it fondly - a dumpster fire.Back 3, wingbacks, deep central two and a shitload of pressure on David Silva.

To add a bit more to the conversation Bielsa played an interesting variation on this with Chile called a 3-3-1-3. It used 3 CBs, 1 deep lying CM with wingbacks and then a total creator behind a striker and two widemen. The double threat down the flanks was incredibly effective in the modern narrow game but the congested central 4 made it difficult to counter attack as the attacking width made it hard to commit sipport down the flanks.

Also, the metro proposal keeps popping up at least during readings in the Senedd every few months, so it at least looks like their committed to it.

None of that has any relevance to their ability to play baseball.

&gt; The issue is that the players aged 24-32 – Lambert, Lovren, Lallana and Balotelli – have failed to either get in the team or play well enough for long enough. The odds suggest that at least one of those should have landed on his feet. With injuries to key players, and the sale of Suarez, it probably needed two of the four to make a big immediate impact.

If you look at my post history, I posted this exact thing yesterday. Rodgers monumentally fucked up this part. He bought garbage experience.  

We know this. No harm buying potential. But Lambert, Mario, Lallana collectively could buy you one ""world class"" (it's subjective as Tomkins says) player. One god damn matchwinner who can fucking score some goals to save his life.

It's tricky to say what they would make part of a coalition agreement because we haven't heard anything formal from the SNP except that they wouldn't do a deal with the Tories (that'd be electoral suicide for them). The new leader Nicola Sturgeon has suggested extensive devolution of power to Holyrood and removal of Trident nuclear submarines from Faslane might be part of a deal with Labour. Alex Salmond indicated, although not sure how serious he was, that the SNP could even advocate devolution of power to the English regions.

Honestly though I doubt the SNP would enter into a coalition. They might if the conditions are right but I'd imagine Labour would have to make major concessions on devolution.

false,KaiserMacCleg,,,"Is it? Let's take another look:

* The rolling stock on *all* the South Wales lines is at or approaching 30 years old, and it shows.
* There isn't *enough* rolling stock. There was a time when it wasn't uncommon to see trains pulling upwards of ten carriages along some of the Valleys lines. Now you're lucky if your train has more than two, even at peak hours, inevitably leading to overcrowding. 
* There aren't enough bleeding platforms. As you've no doubt noticed, Network Rail is currently building more in Cardiff, and no wonder - how many times have you been stuck in the no-man's land between Queen Street and Central? 
* The aforementioned speed issue. Sure, in the case of the Merthyr and Rhondda lines, a large part of that is the excessive number of stations, but as electrification *by itself* is expected to shave over ten minutes off the journey times to Merthyr and Treherbert, that is clearly not the only factor at play. Improvements to signalling being carried out at the moment in Cardiff will likely cut average journey times further. 

I don't think ""broken"" is an exaggeration. 

More importantly than any of that, however, electrification represents a very real foundation upon which we can build in the future. It would allow the development of a light rail network to complement the existing heavy rail. It would bring South Wales up to speed with most other areas of the UK, allowing the standardisation of rolling stock. In the long term, it would be essential in the creation of a Cardiff Metro. 

Together with the M4 relief road around Newport, this constitutes the first major investment in Welsh infrastructure since the A55 finally reached Holyhead back in 2001. I am seriously struggling to comprehend how you can not find it in yourself to welcome it. Personally, I'd be absolutely thrilled to see public transport in (a small part of) Wales finally dragged into the 1970s (the 2010s are still a way off).

Near where I live there was a big anti-fracking protest (funnily enough at a site where there was no fracking or plans for fracking... but thats another story) which Caroline Lucas was a part of. When she got arrested for a public order offence (later cleared but its more a case of not prosecuting an MP rather than being guilt free) she stated her reason for taking part in an illegal protest was because **there was nothing else she could do to effect change**.

I find it very difficult to support an MP who has essentially given up on being an MP.

I also dislike them because of their one-issue politics (then again the same can be said of UKIP, who I also dislike) which has led to a big disparity between environment spending vs health, education and welfare spending by Brighton and Hove City council (who are majority Green). 

EDIT: As well as their anti medical research and anti nuclear power policies I find many of their policies to be damaging to the UK (surrendering our UNSC seat, leaving NATO etc). While I believe their principles behind such decisions are reasonable and agree with them in part it simply isn't advantageous to the country to follow through with these policies.

You chaps are awesome - I did it! Here's the update:

I took your advice and drafted in my other half and a friend to drive him home. I am SO glad I did, it was really nice to have their support. I think I would've been much less confident (and thus more liable to be fleeced) if they weren't there.

The bike itself is in excellent nick, the guy (who was really nice) had a folder full of receipts, MOTs and services (and the all important v5), spare keys and honestly, it looks like he's spent far more on maintaining the thing than it's worth (I paid £775 but most of it's key components are new or really well maintained). I got him to start it from cold for me as you suggested, it runs lovely. I made sure it was clean and well kept, that all the major components were working and I brought along &amp; worked through a little checklist of things (just after I'd posted I had a good google). Everything checked out, so I sorted my insurance and drove it straight home!

The journey home was... dicey... at first. I drove up and down the seller's (fortunately suburban) streets a few times to get my head in gear. It was like learning all over again but in a ridiculously short space of time. I got on, I stalled it. I started it up again, made it to the end of the street, tried to go up into second and accidentally put her in neutral. After a few minutes of general clumsiness and re-familiarisation I got my act together and I began running over all the things I did for my test, U turns, life savers, slow riding, slaloms (I found an appropriate business estate car park, don't worry). My friend escorted me half of the way home (she lives quite far from me) and I got SO FUCKING LOST the rest of the way. I was afraid of city driving, and this was trial by fire - but I was surprisingly fine. I stuck to my lanes and  even though it meant going around the awkward 1 way system a few times, I didn't cheese anybody off and I eventually figured out the right combination of turns to get out of the maze and get home. I'm not frightened of doing it again.

All in all I'd say I'm 60% of the motorcyclist I used to be. I need a LOT more practice, but I don't think I am a danger to myself or others currently. I'm certainly miles better than when I first put on L-plates. I don't think it's *all* come flooding right back but I've definitely still got a handle on all the basics. My plan is to keep it cool &amp; keep it easy for the next few months (ride only in good light and good weather, ride only straight forward routes etc) and see how I get on before making any long journeys. 

Thank you for all the support and advice :) ",0,1416602333,null,0,false,0,cm99ghu,t3_2n0onh,t1_cm99ghu,t3_2n0onh,null,1425906611,11,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,11

false,Hemmers,null,null,"See, if a private school dictated those terms, noone would bat an eyelid - don't like it, place your kid elsewhere - it's your money and your choice.

Free schools are a bit funny because despite being state funded they have levels of autonomy not on a par with private schools, but getting close. The saving grace is they're inspected by OFSTED not ISI, which means the government can dictate certain standards down via OFSTED which will knock the school's report (and potentially force intervention) if they choose not to comply. It's still not perfect though.

I personally disagree with all the choice stuff. The ability of parents to choose is exactly what has caused the prevalence of sink schools at one end and elite schools where you have to lie about your postcode to get in. If they're not going to private school, kids should go to the school *who's catchment they live in*. And they should be guaranteed a place there (they're not currently, which is how you get these ridiculous situations of kids being driven 10 miles past 3 schools to get to the one they've been placed in by a useless local authority) and that's that. It's free FFS. If you don't like it, tough - remortgage the house and go private.

I get that parents want the best for their kids, but this orgy over people getting to choose has made a complete mess of the system. Kids are having to travel past perfectly good schools to get to the one they've been placed in, whilst other kids are being driven past okay schools because their pushy parents managed to get them into one further away. It's a nonsense. The middle ground doesn't seem to be working. *EITHER* have a state system where you go where you're told unless you opt out and go private *OR* go the whole hog and adopt the Scandinavian approach of giving parents vouchers and letting them go private, state, wherever they like.",0,1416603969,null,0,1416604406,0,cm9abzd,t3_2mz2nj,t1_cm9abzd,t1_cm984l6,null,1425906203,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm serious. I came up with this hypothesis a few days before Real won the Spanish Cup (or whatever it was, too lazy to look it up) and cemented it after they won CL. The long/short of it is: **he will get tired of winning.** My initial prediction was that Real would win the Spanish Cup and the league, but not the CL until the following year. They'd win a few more trophies, etc. etc., and after about 3-5 years of this, he would get bored. He'd miss WHL. He'd miss the competition the Premier League offers above La Liga.

Cutting taxes is not something the Conservative Party is ever going to feel uncomfortable with.

&gt; *Introducing a ‘pupil premium’*

Which was Conservative Party policy before the last general election, and promised in the Tories' 2010 manifesto.

&gt; *£900m crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion*

Promises to that effect were made by every political party prior to the last election. The ""crackdown"" hasn't had an appreciable effect anyway, because of wider cuts that have taken their toll in HMRC just as they have everywhere else. As of this September, the workforce is down to 87% of 2011 levels, and falling.

&gt; *Scrapping ID cards.*

The scrapping of something which hadn't yet been introduced? Good one.

The only thing on your list which was a genuine concession by the Tories in the coalition agreement.

false,chrismyface,tardis,TARDIS,"Just to elaborate on a few points well covered by /u/Raggedy-Man:
&gt;spending a full day there

You should allow up to 3 hours for the whole experience - the adventure side now lasts around 30mins and is way more immersive, the rest is an exhibition that covers two floors, so how long you spend depends on how much you want to want to look around and read all the exhibits. 

&gt; touchable props

Dear lord please don't touch the props.

&gt; Non-rushed tours

The walkthroughs are never rushed and will always take the same amount of time - in busy periods a new one starts every 10-15mins so it may seem busier, but this will never impact upon your experience. You can spend as long as you want around the exhibition. 

&gt;Cafe/restaurant/smoking areas

There's a cafe in the lobby area that does hot food and sandwiches and is decently priced. 

&gt;Not too busy

The groups are managed really well and spaced out so that there are never loads of people in one place at the same time. As /u/Raggedy-Man says, it's a big area so it's always calm and airy, and there's loads to look at.

&gt;All round enjoyable experience

Flip yeah, haven for Doctor Who fans. It's really improved over the update too, the exhibition works as a timeline from early Who and culminates in exhibits from series 8.

Firstly, no voting system is ""ideal"". There is simply no such thing.

So, if you want to further increase the influence of parties and put the nail in the coffin of MPs conscientiously taking the progressive option and voting freely, feel free to push for PR. Voting independent of both their party and their constituents is incredibly important - MPs are representatives, not delegates. Were it not for this, we would still have the death penalty, and we certainly wouldn't have gay marriage.

Why is this? Because in a closed proportional list system, parties choose the lists. Parties choose who *they let into Parliament*. PR would be the death of true representative democracy because the whips could not be resisted. They need only drop a word to a party official and that MP who thinks for themselves is looking troublesome and they get pushed down the list every vote, and their chance of being reelected continually diminishes. Really, parties would elect MPs, not the electorate, and parties themselves are not democratic bodies.

Additionally, PR spells the end of any local constituency-MP link.

&gt;A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously for the purposes of sections 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 if:

&gt;* the way he/she drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous; or

&gt;* if it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving the vehicle in its current state (for the purpose of the determination of which regard may be had to anything attached to or carried on or in it, and to the manner in which it is attached or carried) would be dangerous.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_driving#.22Dangerously.22

Seems to me like he meets the first and second of these factors easily even though he only needs to meet one of them - he drove terribly and he continued even after it was clear the car wasn't in a fit state to drive. 

If he is convicted of dangerous driving then the sentencing can be relatively harsh if the judge wants it to be. 

* Minimum 1 year compulsory driving ban (no max) plus a compulsory extended driving test before you drive again. 

* Possible prison sentence of up to 6 months if sentenced without a jury (summarily) or up to 2 years if convinced by a jury (on indictment).

In terms of choices, some schools are better than others, and I certainly can't blame parents for wanting to send their kid to the best school. I can say with certainty that if I didn't pass selection for my school, I would have turned out a fundamentally different person if I went to my local school. It's incredibly how quickly different environments change people and I remember thinking how much my old primary school friends had changed. 

The thing was, my school was riddled with abysmal teachers, it valued it's image over education and it was horrendously underfunded because it tended to perform so well. I think the key difference is that if you put a bunch of relatively intelligent kids together who want to learn, they will learn a lot better. However, if you put an average kid in a school full of people who don't give a shit, then they're going to normalise. 

I'm not sure where to stand on this, because if you took all the kids from my school and put them in their local ones, then most of them would turn out mediocre. You'd be committing a great number of kids with the potential to succeed to mediocrity. We already do this, but to a lesser extent due to selective schools picking them up. But I believe that everyone should have the potential to do that, and that any kid would benefit from having learned in an environment like mine. But I also realise that there are only so many kids enthusiastic about learning and that there's not enough to 'go round'. We had a high concentration in our school, which is what I believe allowed us to succeed as we did.

So I don't know the answer to be honest. Because it seems that the facilities and teaching isn't what makes the difference, rather the disposition of the students. Enthusiastic students encourage others to do better, and disruptive kids bring that down. There's no perfect solution I feel.

false,Hemmers,null,null,"&gt; The thing was, my school was riddled with abysmal teachers, it valued it's image over education and it was horrendously underfunded because it tended to perform so well. I think the key difference is that if you put a bunch of relatively intelligent kids together who want to learn, they will learn a lot better. However, if you put an average kid in a school full of people who don't give a shit, then they're going to normalise.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure where to stand on this, because if you took all the kids from my school and put them in their local ones, then most of them would turn out mediocre. You'd be committing a great number of kids with the potential to succeed to mediocrity. We already do this, but to a lesser extent due to selective schools picking them up. But I believe that everyone should have the potential to do that, and that any kid would benefit from having learned in an environment like mine. But I also realise that there are only so many kids enthusiastic about learning and that there's not enough to 'go round'. We had a high concentration in our school, which is what I believe allowed us to succeed as we did.

I don't disagree. Clearly anyone who gets into that sort of environment is going to be normalised ""up"" thanks to their environment.

I just wonder whether that worsens the ""sink schools"", polarising the system? Is it better to have some excellent schools and some dreadful, or it is it better to totally homogenise. The top kids won't do perhaps as well as they could have - but they'll make that up at university - and hopefully the bottom kids will do a bit better than they would otherwise have done. Homogenised schools don't preclude sets within year groups.

I don't know. There just seems to be a lot of stupidity come around every year with some kids being driven miles and miles because they didn't get a place in their local school, meanwhile someone else is whinging because they were allocated to the near school, not the local grammar school.

When I worked in a really shit call centre (as a data processor) set up by a building company, we were running excel only for 1.2 million (later up to 8 million lines) people's data, printing it out, then updating it by hand. Saying you were registered with TPS made them skip you every now and then, but it was ultimately ignored. 

Disgraced with this system I convinced them to let me build them a database under the guise of improving their lead generation (actually to make my life easier and fix some of this). Although they still made us print out and manually process the data, it was greatly improved. Less TPS complaints but then they turned up with Trading Standards to  see why we got so many complaints. 

Even with all the improvements I'd done they got me to print out data for use that was exclusively TPS so they could call it, and were very unhappy when I 'accidentally' removed all of those rows and made me restore them from a backup. If TS or TPS turned up, they just threw the printouts (and phonebooks, they used those too) in the boot of someone's car until they left. The people who visited weren't technical at all and if I'd have lied to them would never have known.

As for the weather thing, you've heard it before and you'll hear it again. Ride in the rain! Knowing how a bike controls and reacts in the rain is going to help your riding so much - the only thing I'd maybe be put off with is very high winds (like, ones that shut bridges) as you said previously you were quite lightweight and on a small, light bike. 

You'll find the familiarity comes back very quickly. I had about three years off a bike, and when I went to renew my CBT, first 5 minutes I was still somewhat unsure. Throughout the slow ride offroad practice I got better very fast, and by the road ride, I was back up to my old standard. I was told if my CBT road ride was my test, I'd have passed. 

Just get out and ride it, is my advice. Need break/milk/vegan-equivalent-daily-grocieries? Take the bike! [I take my Street Triple shopping all the time](http://i.imgur.com/yIZKqRe.jpg).

Ha, great points. I used to ride in the rain ALL the time (it never stops raining up in Aberdeen, sigh) and my bike definitely handled differently. I'll never forget the first time I fish tailed at a junction, I thought I was going to *die*! I've crossed the Tay bridge once in the wind before, it wasn't closed (well, obviously) but it had warnings for high sided vehicles plastered all over it. I won't lie, I was very close to having a brown trouser moment. Won't be riding in high winds much unless I have to :) 

It's definitely coming back, but I feel a bit less ""in the zone"" than I used to. I used to be incredibly aware of everything around me, and now I feel like most of my attention is on what I'm actually doing with the bike. Does that make sense? When that awareness comes back I'll feel confident in bad weather and at night again. I think it's just practice :)

Shame your CBT wasn't your test in that case! :) My CBT was awful, haha, I remember going through a red light in the first 10 minutes and getting a severe bollocking :x

I love triumphs. They're all so pretty! :). I have to choose between my push bike and my YBR now, so I think it'll get plenty of short odd journeys through the city, no need to worry about that!

additionally, i dont think where you live has anything to do with it - to be paid as a UK company employee you need a National Insurance number, but the requirement for that is only that you have the right to work or study in the UK , which you already do as an EU citizen anyway. 


The only thing I can think your friend may be thinking of is that if you arent a German resident you dont pay german income taxes, but that's not a system we have in the UK, so pretending not to be a resident of either country wouldnt get you any benefits either. If your income arises in the uk, you have to pay tax unless you pay tax on it in another country with which we also have a dual tax agreement.(source https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/366836/rdr1_1_.pdf)

The freedom of information act and the human rights act have the potential for longevity that is maybe unappreciated at present      
Cameron will be remembered as unremarkable, overseeing minor economic growth and being the first of a series of coalition prime ministers. His campaign on gay marriage will be commended, and it's feasible that he's remembered in 20 years time as major is today     
The standout politician of the era depends on what you classify as an era and what happens in the next few years. If Blair is in the era then probably not no matter what. If not, then surely it is dependent on the next general election and the subsequent eu referendum. If he can achieve a plurality of seats in the Commons and steer the referendum to a close no vote (which, whilst hasn't been explicity stated, is what it looks like he wants), then he can nullify Farage whilst looking effective. If he skirts the issue or loses the referendum then surely Farage will be the standout politician of the time.

We are a nation of roughly 40 million people now, spread out within the second largest nation on earth. While you are wrong, we do have a train network (VIA Rail) it is a bit pricey and does take a long time to go coast to coast. In Europe you have a lot more people living in a lot less space so you can build a large fast transit system and it will be profitable. Here in Canada it is great in major cities, but sucks outside.

As to cost of living I think you are wrong. It seems to be more expensive to live in the UK than Canada

false,LightningGeek,eng-staffordshire,Wolves,"&gt; MPG is a terrible way

Why is it a terrible way?

Even though we're officially a metric country, all of our road signs are in miles, we drive in MPH and if you asked most people the distance between places, they would give answers in miles more often than  kilometres. Besides, if you really want l/100km, then you can get it from car companies.

&gt; ...making it much easier to compare the fuel economy of cars.

Again, l/100km is no harder to work out than the MPG. For example, my car does 27mpg on average and has a 13 gallon tank. I know that once I've done 270 miles, I need to start looking for a petrol station.

At the end of the day, it could be measured in pints per metre, as long as the volume and distance have a standard size, then you can always get an accurate result for the efficiency of a car.

Quick edit.

I'm not disagreeing with you that kilometres should be eventually adopted, but to say that mpg is a bad measure of efficiency just because it's an Imperial measurement is flawed.",0,1416617504,null,0,false,0,cm9gmmk,t3_2mzl9w,t1_cm9gmmk,t1_cm9a1rr,null,1425903254,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

For that to work we need to start saying that Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish people deserve more political representation per person than English people which is explicitly unequal and discriminatory. Anyone who says so will be attacked (legitimately) for trying to subvert the will of the people of England. I really don't think it can possibly happen.

At the same time, while you seem to want the public to make things better, they don't have a proven track record of it.

-Accessibility rather than mobility.

-The Green Party would amend and enforce planning rules to steadily reduce car parking requirements

-The Green Party supports the principle of road charging for motorised vehicles

-The Green Party supports a non-residential parking levy to be levied on off-street parking

-There would be no new road building or widening schemes implemented except for essential access

-The Green Party would introduce a 20m.p.h. limit throughout built up areas, including villages

-In rural areas, apart from trunk roads, the maximum speed limit would be 40m.p.h.

-On major roads outside of built up areas, the maximum speed limit allowed would be 55m.p.h. (UCK)

-The Green Party does not support the introduction of Park and Ride services

-Driving tests would be done at regular intervals (e.g. 5 years)

-All speed limits would be rigorously enforced ... Greater use will be made of automatic cameras and other speed measurement.

-car parking will become subject more generally to charging ... In non-residential sections of urban areas, on-street parking should be subject to metering.

-SUVs (Sports Utility Vehicles) consume more fuel, create more pollution and are more hazardous to other road users than ordinary cars. They are quite unnecessary, especially in urban areas, and their purchase and use should be discouraged. They would be subject to extra taxes and charges beyond those in TR060-070 and advertisements for them would need to include information about their adverse effects on society. (Seriously WTF, was this written by a hippie?)

-In order to encourage the use of rail freight and water borne freight there should be a charge for every container entering the country that continues its journey from its port of entry by road. (Because that will really help our economy?)

*Health* problem, not a criminal matter.

Everything is okay in moderation (if you can keep it that way) even the super scary drugs like methamphetamine and crack cocaine. Some drug users including myself can use these drugs and not have any real issues with them but we trip ourselves up on something like alcohol or morphine.

The actual addiction rates for people trying hard drugs for the first time is actually quite low, of the people I know that have tried heroin a few times only a couple have ever stuck with it, same with crack cocaine and amphetamines. 

More people will try drugs, and more people will get addicted to them. But not to the extent that prohibitionists fear, how many under 30s are actually going to give a second thought to buying heroin or crack cocaine when they could be buying pure mdma or Mkat? Maybe a few and those that do will have systems in place to help them out if they ever want to stop using.

the way i see it the public has barely been given a fair shake and neither has democracy, we've so far only witnessed a oligarchical, primordial, version of it, using technology to our advantage will help us see it in its final form. if we want election turnout, let's make it mandatory, give people a 'none of the above' option if needs be but they have to contribute. let's change from the obviously flawed fptp to av/pr.  lets increase transparency so we can see where all the money is coming from and going. lets do the same for our media outlets, who get away with murder when combined with the current voting system. let's reduce inequality without expecting to eliminate it, make sure folks have enough education to inform their choices. in all of this an internet, left unhindered has the potential to contribute positively. the way forward is pretty clear but is being barricaded by the desperate greed of an old guard, who i doubt even know why they do what they do anymore, game of chodes.

things have gotten exponentially better but on timescales of a single human life it's hard to acknowledge. might get messy along the way but we have to hope that trajectory can be maintained.

if we haven't got that much faith in our people, in the possibility of an imperfect but workable democracy and the future might as well start erecting suicide booths instead of voting booths.

The lack of action towards Armani and the rest of the lads in Sierra Leone is currently my biggest criticism of City.  These are people they featured on the website when they needed some nice PR opportunities to create fan engagement.  Now they're dying and people at City are sat in meetings talking about how to provide aid on message.

It's a total disgrace and we should all be ashamed of the Club for their inaction which is allowing more City fans to suffer.

I'm not surprised Mooney didn't mention it and my faith in him as a City writer is next to Jack Pitt Brooke as yet another City writer who is feathering their nest for a job in the media.

As the lad says:

&gt;In fact, the secretary of the Reddish Blues, Howard Burr, had some welcome news on that front too. He works for BT, who have recently discovered around 2,000 bird flu kits containing sterile face masks, which they have agreed to send to Sierra Leone. They agreed to put the batch of hand gels and supplies in the same container free of charge.

How lucky that BT have discovered those.  Far be it that the richest Club in the entire world with trillions of available revenue get up off their arse and do something proactive.  I constantly ask myself why we have these billions yet I'm still donating money regularly to MCFC Sierra Leone.  We have money.  They need money.  It's not rocket science.

Not really, if you know what strength of narcotic your using then you can accurately dose? - ""When the Swiss government began allowing maintanence of heroin users, they were able to collect reliable data about exactly how much heroin was being used. The Swiss found that users offered unlimited quantities would, on average, max out at between 300 and 500 mg. of diacetylmorphine per day. One author writes ""I've known people prescribed a full gram per day, but they were quite unusual, and such habits on the street are impossible except for relatively high level dealers. Remember, I'm talking about pure pharmaceutical or number 4 if on the street. There are certainly cases of pain patients receiving larger equivalent dosages of opioids, but I've never heard of one of these beating a 1000/1 ratio."" [source](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/heroin_dose1.shtml)

If sold at a reasonable price then it would be far from a £100 a day habit, legitimizing opium production in Afghanistan/Burma etc should keep prices low. The only reason heroin is so expensive over in the west is because traffickers need to be paid to move the heroin to market, bypassing these criminals will keep the price far more reasonable. 


Out of about a group of (I think) nine or so different guys that have iv'd heroin,coke etc several times out of morbid curiosity (or for post mkat comedowns) only 4 of them went on to have an issue with heroin (some of the 4 had worse issues with oxycontin/other prescription opiates myself included), only one of them is still using now and thats because he had £100k+ to blow so his tolerance is so fucked the DSPs can't do anything for him (taper would be too painful/dangerous afaik) so he has a prescription.  I suspect the ones that didn't get hooked either didn't see what the fuss was about or get more from stimulants/GABAergics.  The UK has a very party drug oriented drug culture so I'd imagine they find it boring. 

The main killer in a group of about 30 + of us has been benzodiazepines, alcohol and to some extent suicide/ suicidal drug use, other than that its impure drugs/overdose.  Very few actually had any interest in opiates and simply saw them as a last resort comedown tool.

Drugs are dangerous but they are made far more dangerous through prohibition. Imagine how much more bloody dangerous it would be if someone wanted to have a few glasses of scotch at the end of the night had to put up with bathtub scotch of unknown strength and purity. 

Also why do opiates feel so good that no one can use them without abusing them? For some people alcohol feels so good that they just can't help from abusing it, doesn't mean other people can't use it without abusing it. What people define as abuse is also subjective, some might say using heroin once every few days is abuse, I might see using a small amount every couple hours as totally fine but mixing it with alcohol and valium as abuse etc.  

Is using so much heroin you catch a nod abuse?  Maybe it is but to some its the oblivion they use heroin for and they will get that oblivion anyway they can , but using enough to get to that state is made far more dangerous than it already is by prohibition.  Its the same way some drinkers are the fall down drink to oblivion drunks and others can finish two bottles of wine in a night and still be held in high esteem by their peers. Not everyone gets or wants the same thing from their drug of choice.

Although one problem we would have to work out how to overcome in a post prohibitionist society would be polydrug use since it makes drug use far more dangerous and its also very hard to teach people how to use multiple drugs at once as safely as possible.

Woe is me. This is the most optimistic I've ever been about Spurs. For the first time in a long time everyone agrees that we have a manager who is quality and that he isn't the cause of the problem. Maybe now we can actually move to addressing the issue rather than sacking yet another seemingly competent manager. 

Are liverpool fans outraged? Arsenal and United fans? When we spent so much money and played poorly (despite the fact we were 4th) we sacked our manager. I assume Fans are calling for Rodgers, Wengers and Van Gaals heads respectively. 

Our players are trying. Look at how happy they were at villa. Look at the urgency to pick the ball up and go again after we equalised. There are some players that are letting us down, but they'll be gone soon enough because for once we are blaming them and not the manager.

His new network television show was canceled, and he's been missing scheduled public appearances as a result of renewed accusations.  But the accusations themselves are absolutely nothing new. 

They're only renewing the accusations now because he's been out in public doing more work... etc. 

America, and Bill Cosby, should have known full well that if he tried to re-enter the public eye, that this stuff was going to come up again.  No surprise here.  There still isn't really any solid evidence that proves Bill Cosby did any of this stuff either.  And a lot of the women's stories involve them very much ""Going along with it"" to some degree, and accepting money from him, willfully taking unknown pills, as well as having consensual sex after alleged 'sexual assaults' had taken place...

Of course, the problem with her saying that the reason she posted it being that she'd ""never seen anything like it before"" is that she's posted similar pictures in the past.

I don't think it was worth Miliband presumably forcing her to resign over, in fact I think it made it a much bigger gaff than it had to be.

My fear with Russell is he isn't big enough to play that lone striker role that we seem to have set in stone. He's perfect off the bench though, should be included again.

I really think Stevie May can succeed though. England have a pretty good defence and I think thats why he didn't get a sniff. I really think he would be good against teams worse then us or at our level. Should be included in future squads ahead of Martin

Im biased i just wanted to see MacLeod get a cap cause he's been a revelation at Rangers lately. I hope Strachan keeps calling up the youngsters though so they ease into the team.

He also just seems unfriendly, and I don't know why Clara stays with him. He doesn't have the same fatherly feeling that 11 did, which is ironic considering 11 was the younger one.

I just got done with the Orient Express episode and thought ""yeah, I could see you killing everyone, you're kind of a bastard"". I don't get the impression that he's an alien, I get the impression that he's an asshole. He seems to have all the negative qualities of The Doctor with very few of the positive ones.

Having lived in Catalunya for a number of years, I think we in the UK have a limited understanding of a drive for independence - and watching the Scottish referendum felt a bit fake/framed in comparison to the politics there.

What the Scottish referendum certainly did was light a fuse underneath Catalunyan independence. They have already had one 'illegal' vote since, and the drive for independence is getting ever stronger and radical.

Its true, that this movement existed before, but the Scottish referendum has set a democratic prescient for separatist groups across Europe. It has poured a tanker of petrol on a controlled bonfire.

We are probably the most established and respected democracy in Europe - and  if we can allow a vote, why can't Spain, France, Belgium, Italy or Germany, with their separatist movements.

Hey, in 50-100 years,maybe nothing comes of it, but I suspect that Cameron may be remembered as the guy who instigated the great reformation of the European Union - from German dominated federalism and failed economics, into a localised union of competitive free trade.

I also suspect that these UKIP gains are secretly very pleasing for Cameron, because it ties his hands domestically when dealing with Merkel etc on the issue of reform.

...because people buying cars use MPG as a measure of how cheap it will be to run a car, but MPG isn't a measure of cost. It's a measure of range.

 * 20MPG = 14.12 l/100km
 * 30MPG = 9.42 l/100km
 * 40MPG = 7.06 l/100km
 * 50MPG = 5.65 l/100km
 * 60MPG = 4.71 l/100km

Notice how 20-&gt;30MPG is a much bigger fuel (=cost) difference than 50-&gt;60MPG, yet most people would say that when comparing MPGs the difference is the same.

There are very strong arguments against compelling people to take part in a political system they do not want to take part in for which a NOTA option is not acceptable. There are arguments for inequality. There are also strong legal arguments for people's privacy when it comes to funding and owning private enterprises, even if they are taking part in national discourse.

Obviously, all of these arguments are highly contestable. But just deciding you have won isn't how democracy works. You need to convince people that you have won, which hasn't happened yet.

Here, the press are in thrall to their government masters, regardless of their political bias. The only time when the UK press can get away with printing revelations of corruption in government is when someone has literally given them permission to in order to drum someone out of the House or the cabinet.

Then either a) This is then passed to the individual ticket inspectors devices when they are in station through a radio frequency network that is probably similar to WiFi.

This is technologically feasible but I believe the network may have some propagation issues at times.

Or more likely b)  They keep a record of your contactless PAN, then check overnight if you had touched in correctly earlier in your journey or not.  If you did not check in correctly they then charge a penalty fare to you/your card.

The way the European parliament works is designed to screw nation-specific parties, even if they have lots of seats. The result is that you're forced to deal with the nasty politics in the rest of Europe.

No because chocolate cake doesn't have free will and isn't a political party that attracts the far right.

50 minutes to go 26 miles on a train isn't a good service. They could easily cut some of the stops which would massively reduce the times, and also increase the amount of times the train could make the trip to and from Merthyr. This could also be done overnight before the 500 million investment and would improve the valley line network. 

By just dropping stations like Pentrebach in Merthyr and Cwmbach in Aberdare and Pontlottyn then it would massively improve the valleys rail network but also would allow the government/train service to save on upkeep on those areas and spend it elsewhere. 

A simply survey would need to be undertaken to see which stations are under used, and then look at why they are under used. If it’s because there is another station a mile down the road. The government/train service could look at which is the best station for future improvements and growth and close corresponding station.
 
Also I don’t know why they don’t have direct train that go directly to Cardiff from the outskirts, Aberdare, Merthyr, Treherbert between the hours of 7.30 – 9.30 and 4.30 – 6.30.

As for UKIP, electoral history has shown us that when it comes to third parties and predicting success in a general election, byelections are pretty lousy. It is clear that UKIP influence on the next parliament will be dragging the tories to the right, dragging labour into murky anti-migrant territory and making the results of marginal seats highly uncertain.

Ok, the only large party advocating policies that will actually reduce immigration. All the other three support unfiltered immigration from the EU.

&gt; I don't think it's legitimate to want people to not come to your country for no reason other than the fact that they were born on the other side of an imaginary line.

So you believe in entirely unrestricted immigration from any country in the world? Even if ten million people turn up each year from places like the Congo, Somalia and Afghanistan? 

&gt; UKIP pander to the uneducated fears of people who don't know any better.

We all assume that those on our side believe things for educated reasons and those on the other side believe things for uneducated reasons. Frankly, I think you're just displaying snobbery to the working class and their level of intelligence. 

&gt; Europeans aren't stealing our jobs, immigration does nothing but benefit the country. Multiculturalism is one of the best things about the UK, Muslims aren't going to rape your daughter and a polish man isn't going to screw you over on a plumbing job.

Europeans are taking a large share of new jobs created in the UK, and many of those jobs would indeed go to locals if immigration was tighter. Immigration overall costs the UK exchequer money, pushes up far-too-high house prices, puts severe pressure on school places, and increases infrastructure congestion. Multiculturalism is a disastrous philosophy that has discouraged people from integrating and has allowed entire communities to live side by side with little interaction. I can provide evidence for all of these points.

&gt; I really have a hard time seeing UKIP as anything other than BNP lite. Its all imaginary lines and bullshit.

Because you're apparently a very close-minded person that isn't willing to consider other points of view, even if they're put in a polite and decent manner.

Virtually everyone in the UK has some level of education, so that's not true. And there's plenty of very educated people that do. Personally, I have a first class economics degree from a red brick university and support UKIP.

You could tell when they'd been built and for whom, and when they'd been modernised too. We lived in a smallish house for a while, and then we moved into a larger one, and then we moved into one of the houses that had been built for one of the mine managers - that one was practically palatial for the area, but actually is still a pretty poky house.

There's still vents on the (incredibly narrow!) street where coal used to get poured in. One of our houses still has a coal cellar, except we use it for general storage now. Of course that house was extended years and years ago to get a bathroom put in.

On buses, the PANs are downloaded from the ticket machine (the passenger can only have touched in *on* the bus) and then checked against the cards presented by the passenger.
