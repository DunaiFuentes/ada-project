Likewise, the £9k tuition fees policy is likely to cost more money in the long term because of the number of graduates who will never pay back their loan, which the state is then ultimately responsible for writing off 30 years in the future.

There's no question that an independent Scotland would need to do some fiscal belt-tightening but other countries - e.g. Finland after the fall of the USSR, its main trading partner - have done similar and they haven't emerged with the same level of problems that will beset this country after austerity.

**CURRY**, s. In the East the staple food consists of some cereal, either (as in N. India) in the form of flour baked into unleavened cakes, or boiled in the grain, as rice is. Such food having little taste, some small quantity of a much more savoury preparation is added as a relish, or ‘kitchen,’ to use the phrase of our forefathers. And this is in fact the proper office of curry in native diet. It consists of meat, fish, fruit, or vegetables, cooked with a quantity of bruised spices and turmeric [see MUSSALLA]; and a little of this gives a flavour to a large mess of rice. The word is Tamil: kari, i.e. ‘sauce’; [kari, v. ‘to eat by biting’].http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson-Jobson",0,1411540260,null,0,1411569957,0,ckr16nf,t3_2ha6er,t1_ckr16nf,t3_2ha6er,null,1426849580,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

I’m off to (insert country name here) where I intend to be a minority, yet insist that their whole constitution changes to accommodate ME!. Wherever I go…I want Christmas Lights up and whatever the weather, I want nobody to laugh at me if I wear a Santa costume.

I also demand they build me a church with their taxpayer’s money (whether I decide to go or not). I will be incredibly offended if anybody mentions the religion of their own country in my presence. In fact, as well as the church, I would like a traditional English pub to be built, draped in flags with football on the big screen and government subsidised beer (despite the alcohol laws of the country I choose).

I insist that whatever school my kids go to, they must have at least a weekly portion of fish and chips – regardless of whether their school friends like it. Come to think of it, I want the entire school curriculum be altered to include English Language, English History and English Religious studies.

I will meanwhile walk straight into whichever top-flight job I choose, because I will be the only white, English, 30-something, able-bodied male there…and I’ll pull the ‘Caucasian card’ if I have to. Woe betide anybody who spots my incompetence at my job – they’ll be out of there like shrapnel on a London Bus

Whatever country I go to, I will spend my weekends holding placards in the city centre slagging my new home off, and inciting the English to rise up and suicide bomb the hell out of the place.

In order to find the city centre, every road sign has to be taken down and replaced by one that explains directions in the Queen’s English…preferably on the backdrop of the St Georges flag.

Of course, when it comes to policing, the health service and government benefits. I still expect to be first in the queue…in fact, I want my own queue, and with my own public-funded translator…because they don’t speak English where I’m going.

Every single person in my presence must tread on metaphorical eggshells in conversation to me, and recoil at the prospect of accidentally calling reference to beer drinking, Yorkshire pudding, Shakespeare, pale skin or the Six Nations

Another area of fuzzy boundaries is the limitation of judges to interpret bills which last came up when the Hunting Bill was passed via two Acts of Parliament. 

In general the UK doesn't clearly delineate powers but relies on evolving precedent. This makes it easier to determine where new problems get solved.

After him the monarchs were generally more hands-off, although I suspect that if Edward VIII had remained on the throne he'd have been very vocal, given the social and political events that were occurring in Europe in the second half of the 1930s, and his well-known political sympathies.

It was our Queen's father, George VI, who really started the whole ""the monarch does not express political opinions"" thing in earnest, quite possibly because he was by nature a  fairly shy and quiet man (he was the stammering king of The King's Speech) and therefore preferred to leave the shouting and arguing to others.

There are very few instances where there will be a vote that doesn't have an influence on Scotland. Even the famous tuition fees vote did as it affected the money scotland gets through the Barnett formula. Deciding what is an ""English vote"" is the reason that this would never pass through. Nobody would be able to decide. 

Secondly someone did some research recently on the influence of scottish MPs votes in parliament. Only 20 out of the last 3,000 odd since they started keeping records online in 1997 have been altered by scottish MP votes.

I think Zouma definitely needs some game time this season otherwise what would be the point in keeping him here and hindering his progress? These are the sort of games he should be starting and can't see him not starting. Hopefully Azpi and Luis start as the full backs and play well, I think maybe with our problems in defence and Ivanovic wearing Luiz' boots, Mourinho could think of changing things up soon.

Wasn't sure who to go with in midfield and in the end I looked towards the Villa game on Saturday and figured Oscar will start ahead of Ramires, which is why I went with Mikel and Ramires with Baker infront of them but wouldn't be surprised if it's Oscar infront of them just because he didn't start against City and if that's the case I imagine he'll come off after about 60mins.

I think Salah will definetly start due to his lack of gametime and rarely even making the bench. The left side will probably be left to whoever isn't expected to start the Villa game between Schurrle and Willian.

Our striker is probably more difficult than it should be. Drogba seems to be our second choice striker atm when it most definately should be Remy, hopefully he starts and has a good game.

These days there is much less work but you can still pickup jobs by phoning around.  We used to be able to pick our own days to a certain extent but everyone likes a good full time rider who is reliable and they tend to get the best work.  Still if you spell out at the start what days you want to work then it should be ok.

The job itself is tough and it spits out the weak really quickly - we used to get through newbies at an alarming rate - some stuck at it - most didn't last long.    You have to be prepared to do 80 miles or more a day but you also have to accept there may be days where you do 30 miles and earn fuck all.  You get paid per job so - no jobs = no pay.  Certain times of the year like Xmas are busy - August is quiet!  No holiday pay and no sick pay either!

You have to do this in any weather. You may get stuck out in W1 all day in the rain and never get back to your base so if you like the cold and wet for 10 hours a day then no worries. Snow, wind, ice  - no worries!

Believe me you don't know London as well as you think! Unless you have a really detailed knowledge of W1, EC1, WC1 and the city then you will be stopping to check your phone or map a lot which makes you slow

You will fall off!  Everyone I knew did.  Mostly non serious but I lost some teeth along the way and there were a few typical cycling injuries and, sadly to say, the very occasional death. 

I lost 2 or 3 bikes as well, either mangled or stolen so think about how much you value your steed!  It is also very tough on the bike generally so if you have an expensive road bike I'd suggest you leave that at home.  

So it can be cold, wet, dangerous, lonely you may not earn much money and you will fuck your bike up at some point.  How is it then that I loved the job to bits and turned down offers of office jobs to stick with it?

I guess if you love riding then it will be great.  You learn how to handle a bike really well and nothing beats the thrill of charging down Oxford Street with the Sun in your eyes dodging tourists as they step out in front of you.  It does make you feel alive and you will be the fittest you will ever be.  Also I met some cracking people and formed some great friendships.  The main thing I suppose was that at times it was the best fun I ever had in any job and you always go home with a story (which may or may not be entertaining to anyone else!)..

Hope this helps a bit - but bear in mind I am ancient history now and bikes and the industry has moved on.

Either way, you're telling fibs. It says no such thing. In fact it highlights Manchester as possibly having taken this crown somewhere in the early noughties.

&gt;The identity of the second city of the United Kingdom is a subject of some disagreement.[citation needed] A country's second city is the city that is thought to be the second most important, usually after the capital or first city (London, in this case), according to criteria such as population size, economic importance and cultural contribution. The UK has no official second city, nor is there any official mechanism or criteria by which such status could be conferred. Citizens and civic leaders of rival cities often argue over their conflicting claims to this accolade.
&gt;
&gt;Birmingham has generally been regarded as the second city of the United Kingdom, since around the time of World War I,[1] with the largest population and GDP (List of cities by GDP) outside London. Numerous public polls, media references and global city rankings, have quoted Manchester as the second city since 2000. The rise has been attributed to Manchester's growing culture, media, music, sporting and transport connections and widespread renovation since the 1996 Manchester bombing.[2]
&gt;
&gt;According to the 2011 census Manchester's urban area had a population of 2.55m compared to 2.44m for Birmingham[3] The 2011 census also confirmed Manchester as the fastest growing city outside of London population rise with a population rise of 19% (Birmingham 9%).[4][5]

As uneducated in numbers and difference the seats will make. I hope there is still the north of England seats, some areas of London, and possibility some lib dem areas could fall to labour if that party continues to collapse. But fear is they could also be won by UKIP who are conservative but appeal to some of the anti foreign workforce you get in some sectors of union members who tend to vote labour.

However losing Scottish mps votes is still worrying it'll affect how well a labour government or opposition can vote in the commons to sway tory policy. With lib dems collapsing continually, there risks there being a weak left opposition to a strong right one and it'll cause a democratic imbalance. I'd prefer a wobbley balance in commons rather than either side being too strong/easy to vote legislation esp with fears of privatising lot of public services and destruction of some welfare. I did think at last election labour were too going to make harsh cuts and think about part-privatising services, the party was in chaos and desperate it even brought back mandy and Campbell for help. 

I hope as union still stands we are still tied to Scotland in some way even with more devolution, so I hope our Scottish counterparts too don't want to see increase in conservative power in Westminster. Proposals to ban and English parliament is a huge political change to UK despite what some torys say about it being easy/not a big deal. And it could be just as damaging as Scotland going independent was imo. I like to think world has moved on from such nationalism and small island economics. 

To counter that I do fear they'll continue to become less left and more middle/conservative in some polices to appeal to southern counties. I grew up in these conservative counties and I know labour rarely gets in, it is usually lib dem vs tories mostly. So it'll take a lot to get those votes/seats. Also there has been increase of being form tory counties moving into London lately so I'm curious to know if some areas seats will be won/lost.

I want to give Ed a chance, I like what he's been saying lately and he's getting some good coverage. But he has been mostly invisible during conservative government, not sure if his press team are to blame or just press in general. I think they've been rebuilding the party from within and have yet come up with solid policies, until now. When Cameron and conservative policies where discussed a lot during their time in opposition. Ed's push for getting awareness in the 'cost of living crisis' hasn't really hit but they don't seem to be trying other ways to getting it out there.

Not sure we learned much we didn't already know; Mignolet's fucking useless, Toure is a comedy mascot, Sterling is our best player, Markovic looks like £25m wasted, and Lallana is a good player, but for what we paid we got robbed.
 
And Lambert and Balotelli don't allow us to play the sort of amazingly fast, counter-attacking football that we all enjoyed last season.
 
Ratings, for anyone who can be arsed:
 
Mignolet (3). Nice penalty, but it would have been great if he'd managed to stop any of the other 14. Reassuringly hopeless from setpieces, and another two conceded to go with his other 9 or so. We are getting closer to an average number of goals conceded of 2 per game. It's about 1.6 or 1.7 at the moment. He's shit.
 
Toure (4). The expected Toure calamity happened later than usual, with a penalty conceded that anyone could see coming from fucking MILES AWAY. As soon as that Sterling ball went awry, there were Silicon-based lifeforms on Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, who went ""Fucking Toure's going to give away a penno, I bet you""
 
Slakho (4). Has there been a CB pairing in recent memory that made the watching LFC fans as collectively nervous as Slakho and Comedy Toure? His usual ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, YOU DOPEY CLUMSY c**t!?"" mistake arrived as per his usual schedule of at least one per match. 

Enrique (6). Some very good moments in attack and defence, although beaten in the air for the goal. The odd error too, but it was a decent return after so long out, so well done Jose.
 
Manquillo (6). It's too early to make a call about this young lad, but he was pretty solid last night after the short-lived horror of West Ham.
 
Rossiter (7). His widely predicted start was a success. Worked very hard, took reponsibility and scored. Can't ask for more than that on a full debut
 
Lucas (6). Steady game in his preferred (and only viable) position. Not good enough to start against top-flight opponents, but perfect for games like this.
 
Lallana (6). OK so he's never going to look like he was worth £25m, and gave the ball away far too often, but he's busy, hardworking and tries to create. Needs to have a crack at goal more often. Useful workout.
 
Sterling (6). Not at his best, but worryingly still looked like our best player.
 
Markovic (5). Oh dear. Another player who is staretng to worry me. Very ordinary game, looked tentative and unsure and totally shit himself when in position to shoot. Lots of work to do here
 
Lambert (5). Average. He looked cumbersome and we all know he's really slow, but he didn't do enough to bring others into the game and was rarely a threat. His Liverpool career isn't going to set Anfield alight, but it's not even sparking yet.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;BRITAIN’S economy is roaring along. The IMF thinks it will outpace that of every G7 country in 2014. In the past twelve months 774,000 jobs have been created; the adult employment rate, at 73%, is on the verge of breaking a record set in 1974. Yet this humming engine is so far doing surprisingly little for the country’s finances. As the economy revs up, the Treasury is not benefiting from the acceleration.

&gt;In 2010 George Osborne, Britain’s newly appointed chancellor, promised to close the deficit—then 11% of GDP—within five years. He is only two-fifths of the way there. Until last year his problem was slow growth, which weighed on receipts and kept unemployment and benefits spending high. That cannot explain the present weakness of the public accounts. In March the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s fiscal watchdog, forecast borrowing to fall by £10.4 billion ($17 billion) in the 2014-15 financial year. Four months in, it is up by £1.8 billion.

&gt;Mr Osborne’s spending cuts are proceeding more-or-less as planned. A consumption boom has boosted VAT receipts. Stamp duty, paid on house sales, is up by an astonishing 71% since January 2013, adjusting for inflation—the result of a housing boom. The big problem is income tax, which accounts for just over a quarter of government revenue. Mr Osborne is seeking £11 billion more from income tax this year; less than a tenth of that sum has materialised so far, notes Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC, a bank.

&gt;Comparisons with last year’s receipts look particularly dismal because many bonus payments were shifted into that year to take advantage of a reduction in the top rate of tax. A one-off levy on Swiss bank accounts filled the Treasury’s coffers by £900m a year ago, too. But the root of the problem is structural. Britain is having a job-rich, tax-poor recovery (see chart).


&gt;Wages are stagnating: average weekly earnings are up just 0.1% so far this financial year. Lower paying part-time work, self-employment and zero-hours contracts have replaced some full-time jobs. This is bad for the Treasury because every additional worker must earn his tax-free allowance—recently raised to £10,000 and due to rise further—before he starts paying income tax. An accountant earning £28,000 a year contributes more than four times as much as a cleaner earning £14,000. Moreover, when wages fail to keep pace with inflation, workers across the income scale are pulled into lower tax brackets—a phenomenon dubbed “reverse fiscal drag”.

&gt;All this accentuates a long-running trend: the Treasury’s increasing reliance on high-flyers. The top 1% of earners are thought to have contributed 28% of all income taxes in 2013-14; the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, says the proportion was only 11% in 1979. Inevitably, this makes receipts more volatile. In particular, they are sensitive to pay packets in the City, which have been constrained recently by regulation and restructurings. Average weekly earnings in finance and business services have fallen slightly this year. The Treasury may have bailed out the banks, but they are not returning the favour.

&gt;For wages—and hence tax income—to rise, two things must happen. First, Britain must close the output gap (a measure of slack in the economy). The Bank of England revised down its estimate of this gap in August. Second, productivity must rise. Ultimately, the value of what people produce drives wages, and output per hour is far below its pre-crisis trend. Britain must use more of its resources and get more from them.

&gt;The state of the public finances leaves Mr Osborne vulnerable to attack. He already faces criticism over the lack of wage growth, which his opponents say is causing a “cost-of-living crisis”. Now wage stagnation also threatens his flagship deficit-reduction strategy. But Labour’s shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, will not be cheering too loudly either. Mr Balls has pledged to deliver a budget surplus—albeit excluding investment spending—as soon as possible in the next parliament. That will mean cuts, and yet more painful cuts.",0,1411552267,null,0,false,0,ckr3g43,t3_2hbebx,t1_ckr3g43,t3_2hbebx,null,1426848456,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Balotelli is the issue. He needs to stay up the field. It seems like he's always coming back into midfield to pick up the ball or, more frequently, out onto the left wing. We need someone to be a reliable target and, not to sound too much like a MOTD pundit, to make at least some runs in behind. Maybe he clicks with Sturridge if they get a prolonged, healthy run together but then we have a similar problem to when we had Suarez that we can only play one holding mid and if it's Stevie he looks noticeably worse in that role than even just a year ago. We've been terrible in 4-2-3-1 and that's in part because Balotelli doesn't look like he provides any threat as a lone striker. It's certainly a concern; I don't know how Stevie and Mario fit together into a team.

I'm also worried about Lallana and Markovic. Lallana holds the ball forever. When he finally did something one touch it created a goal yesterday but he dribbles so much. I'm not sure what Markovic is. Is he a RWF in a system we don't play? Has he taken a shot since that back post volley attempt 30 seconds into his first appearance?

Instead of trying to be really nice to his owners to make sure he is most liked, Wallace is trying to not upset them at all by basically doing nothing except sleep and eat.  This is causing the owners to like him a bit less as each day passes because he is boring, but he hasn't really dropped too much in popularity because he hasn't accidentally shit the bed or anything.

The city is safe just dont do stupid stuff and put yourself at crazy risks. The city is full of students not much older than you, I think we're safer than most places. Drinking related stupidity is the greatest risk around here - stupid stuff happens to drunk people. Although surprisingly rarely considering how drunk some people get.

The fact that you've taken the time to ask your question here is a good sign. Take a look on hostelworld to find a good hostel. Talk to others at the hostel and make some friends. There will be others who will welcome you. You'll have more fun exploring if you make some friends. Its easy in a hostel with a good common area. check the reviews on hostelworld. Just be careful if you go out on pub crawls with the hostel folks

There are good trips out of the city as well - there are buses up to Aviemore and you can get a train or a bus to Stirling. Aviemore is only 2 hours away IIRC - tons of outdoors stuff to do there. Easy to climb ""Cairngorm"". Our 2nd highest mountain (its just a path to the summit)

Have fun !

Cheap products generally have cheap ingredients some of which are inert (eg. mineral oil, petrolatum) and others are harsh (eg. alcohol denat, anionic surfactants).

If you have free prescriptions you could try your family doctor as already suggested, but you will likely get harsh products similar to those you have already tried initially (benzoyl peroxide, alcohol denat, sulphate surfactants). If you push the idea that your skin is overly sensitive you *might* get gentler options. 4% niacinamide gel (Nicam brand) is listed in the pharmacy bible (BNF) so can be prescribed. Otherwise you might be offered 15% azaleic acid (Finacea brand) or a topical antibiotic cream/ gel.

In the Wiki entries for niacinamide and SAP I have tried to go for budget and high street options wherever they exist, and list percentages if they are given. But as you can see budget products often don't list the concentration or don't exist at all.

I believe CeraVe moisturisers represents great value for money from Amazon. The AM facial moisturising lotion for example has all the lipids needed to boost the skin barrier AND niacinamide for acne/ the skin barrier AND a sunscreen (albeit chemical IIRC). There simply is no UK equivalent that is any cheaper and Amazon service is great/ easy to purchase/ reasonably quick delivery.

IMO no need to spend a lot on cleansers since most ends up down the plughole, the beginners regimen here is being worked on but somewhere in the side bar Boots Simply Sensitive foaming face wash is recommended. There is also Simple refreshing facial wash - half price at Superdrug recently or try Bodycare - both of these are sulphate surfactant free so should be gentler than what you are using. Oftentimes you can use much less of a foaming wash diluted with water before applying and still get clean skin.

Not a Labour member, but this strikes me as a silly irrelevance; it's possible for diverse people to agree on one issue without agreeing on every other issue.  I doubt the SNP are fully on board with every single SSP and Green policy either, but they cooperated together in Yes Scotland because of their shared belief in Scottish independence.  Labour agreeing with the Tories that the UK is better together doesn't (and shouldn't) remotely affect their view that several other Tory policies are total bollocks.

Your best bet, in terms of both cost and safety, is probably to hit one of the backpackers' hostels on or around the Royal Mile. As a couple of other people have said, you'll probably find other people to hang out with that way, and the hostel staff will be used to dealing with the concerns of young solo travellers. Also, it's an area where there are people around at all hours, so you'll feel safer. Just mind your bag - like any city, Edinburgh has its thieves so make sure your belongings are always secure. 

Navigating is dead easy, especially in the Old Town (which is the most touristy bit). There are lots of memorable landmarks that you can use to get your bearings, and there are free maps available at most tourist attractions and in a lot of cafes. I'd recommend picking up a free map from the Old Town Information Centre at St Giles Cathedral (on the Royal Mile, hard to miss) - the ones they've got have discount vouchers for a variety of things. There's plenty to do but most of it costs, so discounts are worth having!

* Increase the size of the congestion zone

* Find a way to reduce the cost of taxis, by using white cabs. A white cab is like a black cab but the driver hasn't done the knowledge and can use GPS or asks you for directions. People who know where they're going will hail a white cab etc.

The main idea is to reduce the number of cars until it's just buses, coaches, taxis, the disabled and delivery vehicles. Then it's much better for cyclists (motor and push)

Finally we put in charging points for electric bikes (both types) and move central London between 07:00 and 19:00 a two wheeled (+taxis) electric zone.

false,thejdcole,flair2,,"I have been thinking about this for a while and he is spot on about the atmosphere decreasing after our champions league run. I've been a fan for my whole life and I have been going to games since I was a young child, but I really started paying attention when I was about 10 or 11.

My family used to have season tickets in the North Upper stand, and back in the early 2000's (maybe from 2002-2005 or so) the North Stand was the quietest (relatively speaking), but people would still sing!

Chants of Come on You Spurs would travel around the ground like a wave emanating from the south and east stands (arguably the louder stands) travelling around and reaching the North stand where me and one of my family members were (we could only afford 2 season tickets, so we shared). By the time it reached the North stand, it would stay for at least 4 or 5 repetitions, sung at full volume by the majority. 

I remember it fondly, bonding with either my Mum or my Dad at the games, both not afraid to explain chants and songs to me, even if they were either non PC or contained swear words. Although I wouldn't sing the rude songs, we would laugh about them. They would also explain to me why we sang Yid army, and why it was important. The most important chant I have sung, and emotional chant, was when we found out mid-game Martin Jol was going to sacked even before he knew (during our 2-1 defeat to Getafe in 2007). The news travelled slowly around the stadium full of murmurs and comments of disbelief, and eventually the stadium erupted into song, singing for Martin Jol, and the singing didn't end very quickly. 

I moved out of London well before our Champions league run, and along with leaving London behind we also had to leave our season tickets, as the cost of them as well as travel to London every week would have proved too much so I didn't need to get to see any of the games in person. You don't need to look hard to find videos of our run in the Champions League, which is modern legend for most if not all Spurs fans, the Bale Hat-trick, beating the current holders, Inter, at home, and beating AC Milan at the San Siro. [Any video you watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWoLXNTQ7p4) will have the never ending background of Come on You Spurs, or Oh when the spurs go marching in. It's not hard to argue, that the fans for our champions league runs were definitely the 12th man at home, and would have at least helped a bit towards our home victories. 

I still go to games occasionally, as I have done since the Season Tickets were sold. I am a One Hotspur member, so I grab a few cheaper tickets now and then, mostly lower profile league games and Europa. I have to say, personally, the atmosphere has deteriorated immensely since our champions league run. Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is still there for the North London Derby, and some higher profile games, but it has diminished for lower profile games. Fans still sing if things are looking good, fans still sing and cheer if we score, but it doesn't feel the same. 10 years ago, if we were losing 3-0 to Chelsea at home, I would be disappointed, annoyed and generally down, but I would still be singing, and supporting my team, because that's why I was there, to support them blindly and without question during the game (the questioning can come after, but leave it out when the team needs your support the most). 

Back then, 10 years ago, losing at home to Chelsea, losing 2-1 to a lower table side, it wasn't as unusual as fans think it should be for Tottenham now. Now after the champions league run, expectations are so very very high, we have set ourselves an unrealistically high bar. Meeting the standard set by beating Inter Milan 3-1 is a very difficult standard to achieve week in week out, without many of the same players. No Modric, no Bale, no Van der Vaart. I know we have a very good set of players with us now, but our two main stars (Eriksen and Lamela) are still both young, Bale and Modric have gone on to become some of the best mid-fielders in the world. 

When I go to a match now, generally against lower table opposition, the expectation is so high, that unless we are beating them 2-0 within the first half an hour there is little singing being done. Sometimes you feel like the odd one out, you want to sing and support your team, but you feel like if you start singing, you're surrounded by people that would think ""what the hell are you doing mate"" rather than your comrades who would stand up alongside you and sing. 

I was at a match last year with my brother, a Europa game, when we scored, my brother and I celebrated in a usual jump up and down and yell and clap style. The ball hadn't even been kicked back to the centre circle for kick off yet when some bloke behind us told us to sit back down in a very angry manner. We were in disbelief, ""we've just scored!"" we were thinking, and my brother told him we were just celebrating the goal, and we'll sit down now. Sometimes that kind of thing makes you feel like a stranger in your own home, we've just scored and this man still isn't in any kind celebratory mood, why not?. Football should be a game where, if your team scores you hug your neighbour next to you even if you don't know their name, because you are in it together, they are your team, and at least you can share that, share that moment and emotion. 

It just seems that people are still living in our champions league past, which was 4 years ago now, we are constantly reminded by it as it is our current aspiration to achieve champions league football again. There is nothing wrong with reminiscing, but we need to get behind the team now whether or not they are performing as well as our 2010 CL team did. No match I have witnessed personally is better than our 2008 Carling Cup win at Wembley Stadium, I like to look back at it fondly, but I don't compare that to games now and let it put a dampener on them. We need to support our team now, and stop making unfair and unrealistic comparisons to the past. I know the highs of CL football in 2010 were so high, and we all love the club, and all we want is for that to happen again, but at least we could try and help, and chant for our team no matter how badly they are playing, and certainly not booing them at half time.

&gt;Wessex has no official borders and a long history, making it an ill-defined area of southern England centred around, but not limited to, the counties of Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, and Hampshire. For the purposes of this subreddit, Wessex is defined as these four counties and their neighbours.

My definition is fairly inclusive, as I don't want to exclude any areas that have a reasonable claim to being in Wessex.

As a region I think Wessex is a viable alternative to the West Country. It allows for Cornwall to do it's own thing, and pushes the eastern boundary further to definitely include Hampshire, which is useful for those in Dorset and the Wiltshire who look East rather than West.

While the West Country identity is stronger today, Wessex has longer cultural recognition including symbolism and a recognised flag. The West Country has closer cultural affinity, but it's not as though there's as much difference across Wessex as there is across England.

If it ended up in self-government Wessex would be a larger and wealthier region than the West Country, while having a similar economic make up.

false,stufstuf,null,null,"If your skin is feeling that way, then the products that you're using probably aren't good enough. 

It sounds like your skin is similar to mine! A lot of what I'm explaining to you is based off the idea that you're repairing your moisture barrier. I've written a bit more about it [here](http://adoredee.com/2014/07/16/skincare-addiction-cleansing/), so give it a read sometime.

So you have two issues right now. Oily skin &amp; Acne. Let's talk about how to help both!


**Cleanser**

Because you have oily skin, I would recommend an oil cleanser. Bear with me! The idea is that your skin is overproducing oil because it's actually really *dehydrated*. So when you scrub and scrub, your skin freaks out, thinks there's no moisture and makes more.

There are two types of oil cleansers, ones that are just pure oil and need something else to make sure they are totally washed off and ones that
emulsify (they can be washed off with just water).

You would do this step, twice a day.

* Option 1: £2.90

With a totally dry face, you put a 10p amount of [Johnson's Baby First Touch Oil](http://www.boots.com/en/Johnsons-Baby-First-Touch-Oil-200ml_1487558/) and rub it in. Then you wash it off with [Boots Simply Sensitive Foaming Cleansing Wash](http://www.boots.com/en/Boots-Simply-Sensitive-Foaming-Cleansing-Wash-150ml_1189231/).

I'd recommend the Baby's First Touch version because it has no perfume, and some people find perfume irritating. With your acne, a chance of irritation isn't something you want!

* Option 2: £5.33

With a totally dry face, apply two pumps of [L'Oréal Paris Skin Perfection 15 Second Miracle Cleansing Oil](http://www.boots.com/en/LOreal-Paris-Skin-Perfection-15-Second-Miracle-Cleansing-Oil-Face-and-Eyes-150ml_1299736/) then wash off with water. You can also follow this up with the Boots cleanser, but that's up to you. You just have to make sure you wash the oil off properly with water.

**Exfoliator**

In the UK we tend to lump exfoliator in the cleansing step with really harsh scrubs. This is not great. The scrubs do more damage than good. Chemical exfoliators are actually more gentle as all you do is wipe it on with a cotton pad, or slap it on with your hands and you're good to go! Essentially they work by increasing skin cell turnover.

Do this all at night! So in the morning you can just wash your face, pop moisturiser on and then go. 

* Option 1: 2 for £5

[Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control® 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion](http://www.boots.com/en/Neutrogena-Visibly-Clear-Spot-Stress-Control-3-in-1-Daily-Cleansing-Lotion_1043965/) &amp; [Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment](http://www.boots.com/en/Neutrogena-Visibly-Clear-Spot-Stress-Control-Hydrating-Spot-Treatment-40ml_1114065/). 

They are both the same product, but they're on sale right now, so I thought I'd talk about them. They have salicylic Acid in them which is a Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) that works as an anti inflammatory,is antibacterial and can cut through the oil to get to work on your skin. 

* Option 2: As much as you like!

There are so many options for BHA exfoliators! Cheaper ones, and more expensive ones! Check the sidebar. You might even have one at home that you didn't know about (:

* Option 3: £1.49

[Simple Kind To Skin Soothing Toner](http://www.superdrug.com/Simple/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Soothing-Toner-50ml/p/384518). The killer ingredient is the [Niacinamide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients/niacinamide).  

It's important that you don't use this product as the same time as other chemical exfoliators. I can react negatively. So this might be something you use in the morning.

**Moisturiser**

You might think because you have oily skin you shouldn't moisturise, you'd be wrong!

[Garnier Fresh Essentials: Grape](http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/facial-care/garnier-fresh-moisturising-pot-50ml). Boots do sell it, but they don't have it on their website yet. This moisturiser is really good. 

Suncream. I don't have any suggestions, so you're on your own! Check the Holy Grail topics, or maybe you have one you like already. If you use the BHA at night, then use sunscreen in the morning as BHAs make your skin a bit more sensitive to UV Rays. 

----

**IMPORTANT!**

* Introduce these products one at a time, otherwise your skin might freak out and be worse than before. I know it's exciting! But seriously, one at a time. 

* Patch test everything! Put a bit of the product on a small-ish area of your face for about a week (or two if you can manage it!). If that patch doesn't get worse, then use it on the rest of your face.

* Take photos of your skin every few days so you can see the progress. If it looks like it's getting worse, then discontinue something. That way you won't keep doing something that's making your skin worse.

“What is this deceit? It is that the deficit was caused by chronic overspending rather than a global financial crisis that resulted in recession and a calamitous collapse in tax revenues. One pound in every five of corporation tax disappeared in 2009-10. Their deceit ignores the evidence from around the world that a global credit crunch caused deficits to rise on every continent. The US and Japan face deficits of the same scale and for the same reason.
“Their deceit seeks to rewrite history, airbrushing out the fact that Britain’s debt at the outset of this crisis was the second-lowest in the G7; lower than it was under the Tories in 1997. And it forgets that neither of the two parties now in government called for lower spending at the time.”

I don't think you read my last statement, talking about my employment. Of course I work. I have *never* received handouts.

When I lived in the UK, I didn't want other people's money. I wanted other people to stop taking mine. Conservatives seem to think that only the government can take money away and only the government can tax.

Well, I need a house, energy, transport to work and they all cost a bloody fortune now that they are entirely privatised. What is rail fare, if not a tax? House rent is a form of tax - it's not like I can live on the street. Entirely private everything has been a disaster for the UK. I am what the Tories may have considered prime Tory material in the 70s, but what they stand for has made my life harder, not better.

If I were to guess, your friends ""living very comfortable"" are either living student-like lives in shared accomodation, or bought a house more than a few years ago, and are doing well off the government teat with their state-sponsored low interest rates.

I moved abroad. My life is orders of magnitude better than it was. I'm not going to bother to keep arguing with you, as you clearly have a view of the world you don't want shattered. Life is NOT bad for me now, as I have moved away.

false,ghorun,null,null,"&gt; Playing on the break is how you beat Barca and Bayern. Madrid is different but you still play much more defensively than we have been in previous seasons, especially in the away leg.

That's what I meant when I said that ManC has to learn how to play more cynically. On the break there is always a side pass to kill the break and transition into the possession phase. And I really think we won't see much of counter attacking football under Pellegrini as himself said that some teams play big teams' football and other play like Stoke.

Also, to me, we might not see much of 4-3-3 for the simple fact that the system almost forbid us to exploit our squad. You'd have to get Toure in the deep #10 spot (who is, in my opinion, weaker in this position, just watch Côte d'Ivoire's games), Silva on the bench, Nasri, like Silva when played on the wing, is more of half space guy than a winger, Jovetic can't play sole striker (to me he is a ""satellite"" striker), Dzeko is great but is a momentum killer on the break. 

When I look at the squad I can't think of playing 4-3-3. I'll maybe be proven wrong but I expect to see Fernandinho and Fernando getting the starts ahead of Toure in the 2015-2016 season, as Fernandinho excelled in Toure's role at Donetsk and Fernando being way more of natural DM than Fernandinho.

Just to sum-up my thoughts: I really think it's Yaya that should be dropped in big games (in which we don't get the possession to be more precise) rather than the formation and the playstyle of the team. Toure is immense if the opposition is sitting deep though and, for that, is still so valuable to the squad.",0,1411561789,null,0,1411563296,0,ckr5esh,t3_2h7snw,t1_ckr5esh,t1_ckr4xs2,null,1426847539,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

The work programme was hell (Avanta), I had to fight off 9 sanctions in the space of 7 months with them, all of which were overturned due to stupid reasons, like them getting my address mixed up with other claimants and mixing our appointment letters up. Thing is, even when you went in with the letters in hand to show them their fuck up, they'd still send the sanction through. Took me 5 weeks trying to sort one of them out, that's 5 weeks of living on housing benefit alone (£95 a month), when my rent is £105 and once you add on electric, gas, water, internet, food. I found myself going days without a meal.

I'm back at the jobcentre now though, have been for about 2 weeks. They've had me in every day this week, just for 5-10 minutes at a time. Today was for a jobsearch with an advisor, they picked out one job, as that's all there was that I hadn't already applied for. So I came home, spent the less than 5 minutes that it takes to apply for it (I have millions of covering letters and job specific cv's from courses and the likes) and I'm back in tomorrow morning for them to check my direct gov account that I have applied for it.

The advisor is pleasant though, in fact I haven't had a negative encounter with anybody at the local jobcentre, only those that work at the work programme.

Oh and as for the universal jobmatch, it's still not mandatory to allow them access.

&gt;Being gods representative on earth and head of the Church of England comes with alot power you know.

None of which is really hers to wield independently. And in any case, I'm not sure anyone actually regards her as gods' representative. Not really sure what this has to do with her wielding political power.

&gt;Not to mention that most of the right wing is inherently monarchist, by definition[1] .

Not really sure what difference that makes to anything either, consider she's not in a position of power to use at her whim (which would be required for this to be a tangible problem).

&gt;Or that the freemasons who riddle the corporate world with their presence revere her as head of a bloodline descended from Jesus christ.

Love, love, love, LOVE that serum, oh my gosh. I love it a lot. But considering it doesn't have any active ingredients, it is pricey. I've got about 30% left of my bottle, it lasted such a long time with regular use. It always just left my skin feeling nice and extra moisturised and I've yet to find another serum that's made my skin feel that way.

Ask in L'Occitane for samples. If they don't have any of the serum, I can send you some in the post. I've got *loads*. 

Vichy Normaderm Night Detox is my HG night cream. I have oily skin and I'd been using L'Occitane's Divine cream but I'd wake up feeling like an oil slick, yack.

If you look at how the regulatory structures and processes work in financial companies for example, you will see how tight everything is and how accountable people are.

Before you can fix ANYTHING, you need to understand it. Listening to opinions is no substitution for measurement.

For reference, I designed some of the systems used in hospitals (including part of the original NHS Spine system) so I know the inner workings, the processes and the bottlenecks, and how information and people flow between the trusts. Perhaps better than the caregivers even. I know where the problems are and it's nothing like you say.

Lets break this down then into some actions which would kill a lot of the problems:

1. Flatten the management heirarchy entirely. There is too much management. I'm sure you agree entirely there. It takes too long for issues to reach a point where a critical decision can be made. Only you can push that.

2. Process automation, accountability. Everything everyone does should be signed and timestamped with their smart cards. That's a *massive* issue. All processes need automation rather than the terrible paper chains and note handover procedures that are currently used. Too many mistakes are made because it's easy to get away with it. Only you can push that by forcing accountability.

3. Stop contracting out repairs on equipment. That's why you have a shortage. You have to ship off-site and there are no reserves. Not because you can't afford it but because the procurement process (1) is broken and there are no bulk purchasing schemes across the trusts. Each trust has their own purchasing procedure.

4. Seriously, and this is going to hurt and I have no regrets saying this: stop fucking up. Part of (2) is it's too easy for people to fuck up and get away with it. Each fuck up multiplies the amount of time it takes to get someone out of the hospital therefore causing a backlog.

5. Run your departments using Kanban or an adaptive methodology. At the moment, it's a hotch potch of disorganisation because TBH absolutely no one knows how to organise a team of people (that includes NHS management) and has no intent in improving the situation for themselves or their colleagues.

There is enough money and time to go around and cope with the current patient load if three things are promoted:

1. Self improvement.

2. Self planning

3. Communication

At the moment they're all fucked so you're hanging yourselves.

It's also why I no longer work with the NHS. The appetite for change isn't there at any level. If that isn't getting fixed, it's hopeless.

The NHS is not broken; the people are. Stop defending it and be the one to change it not the one whinging about it.

Most of the answers here are more about when our monarchs stopped being vocal about British politics, but the trend of real power moving from the monarch to parliament goes much further back, and waxed and waned depending on the monarchs and nobles involved in the country at the time.

However the transition from James II to William III and Mary is probably the biggest shift. James was the last of the Stuart kings, who were generally very absolutist, believing in their right to exercise their power and parliament being a tool for them to wield. It was this attitude as much as anything that led to his father Charles I being beheaded in the Civil War.

The Glorious Revolution in 1688 saw senior parliamentary figures invite William and Mary (Mary was a daughter of James II, and William was her Dutch husband and a sort-of monarch in his own right) to become the rulers of Great Britain. James II hightailed it out of the country, with almost no battles being fought.

The changeover allowed parliament to make a lot of changes which solidified their power in the country, most notably the 1689 Bill of Rights. This trend continued, helped by the fact that the following monarchs had weakish claims to the throne. I would say the change in the century and a bit from the end of Elizabeth I in 1603 to the start of George I's reign in 1714 saw the most drastic reduction in the monarch's power in English history.",0,1411563449,null,0,false,0,ckr5xf5,t3_2hb630,t1_ckr5xf5,t3_2hb630,null,1426847297,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

Firstly it started off like others, but then a combination of international factors and domestic policies meant that unemployment recovered relatively quickly. People were no more productive, the country didn't produce more goods and services, but we just piled more of them into jobs. At the same time, incomes fell in real terms which makes sense if you can think about it - these new workers don't seem to be adding real tangible value so why would we pay them?

However, it's taken an unprecedented time for the economy to get back to pre-crisis peak. Whilst the great depression had a deeper slump, the great recession had a far longer one. There just seemed to be such slow growth despite all the advantages we had over competitors (insulation from Eurozone crisis, educated workforce, good health + social 'safety net', low corporate tax / tax enforcement, London, foreign cashflows as a safe haven economy, etc.) we lagged behind most of the G8 for a number of years.

So you're right I guess that you can say with any problem ""give it more time"" but the unusual, unprecedented things about this recession that are worth questioning is:

We currently use gas. It mostly comes from Qatar. Europe also uses gas. It mostly comes from Russia. 

If we could produce and sell gas instead, how is that not better? The same amount gets burned, but at least we get the money at the end of it. Plus it reduces dependence on, and funding of, countries we don't like.  

This idea is realistic and can actually work. And it could generate massive amount of money for the UK and renewable energy. Nothing else will cause a breakthrough or any serious effort into renewables. We like to think Germany is leading the way in renewables, but their domestic utility bills are almost 2x higher than ours. The British public wouldn't tolerate that (and rightly so).

**Price of product:** £20 for 30ml/1.01fl.oz


**Where did you purchase:** FeelUnique.com with a 6% voucher, £18.80

**Product claims:** ""With a unique blend of vitamins and minerals, this peptide serum is a refreshing, light textured and effective hydrator that leaves skin visibly healthy and well balanced. Recommended for combination skin, it helps to renew the skin's natural surface revealing a richer and harmonised look.""

**About you:** Dehydrated combo skin, prone to break outs and hormonal cysts, sensitive to exfoliation (chemical and physical).

**Your opinion:** I've only used it once so far and am liking it. It doesn't leave a residue or stickiness, isn't greasy, but the fragrance could be annoying for some it smells like apple gummies. Comes in a frosted bottle with a pump and it's obvious this isn't from a huge company, the batch numbers are written on it in black biro and the label is wonky which some might consider a personal touch. I also like that it has a peptide and vitamin C (unknown percentage) too, cuts out a few specialised product steps.

1 week update: This stuff is amazing! I had some PIH on my cheek that had been sitting around for 2 months already, but they've faded into pin pricks of darkness, really should get into the whole progress pics habit. A bit more about the serum itself, the smell is natural apple along the lines of apple pie filling/sauce so it's not sickly artifical sweet. It's also pretty watery and I have to do half pumps on fingers to avoid it running off. On the other hand this means it spreads around well and there is a slightly stickiness but doesn't last long, 2-3mins max, using less = less stickiness. Definite repurchase for me, unless something else catches my eye.

It seems likely that labour would win a majority simply because normally incumbent parties lose support over their term - the fact that the conservatives didn't get an outright majority in the first election is going to make holding off the fall in support even more difficult.

However another way of looking at it is following the money; betting odds can normally be a good ballpark indicator as arbitrage funnily enough incorporates (theoretically) all currently known public information into the odds. Currently based on the gambling odds we're looking at:

50% chance of no overall majority  
35% of labour majority  
25% of conservative majority  
~0-1% any other majority

and in number of seats:

58% labour most seats  
48% tories most seats  
2% UKIP most seats  
~0-1% LD most seats

What basis do you have for asserting that they won't simply turn into the older generation and vote for the same things once they have more to lose? Scotland's older generation is increasing, not going down.

Stop making silly statements, then.

You pointed out that 'Westminster is showing signs of backtracking' within just over a *week* of the referendum ending. That kind of statement deserved the reply you got.

Then You drew a parallel with Quebec, and stated that they started campaigning for independence in the 60's and 'up until then, the idea was unheard of - just as it was in Scotland until recently'.

1) Your can't really equate Scotland with Quebec.
2) Scotland last had a referendum in 1979, 10-15 years after the 60's.
3) Scotland's independence hasn't been heard of until recently? See above.
4) Quebec's 1995 referendum wasn't nearly as certain as the Scottish one last week.

On the other hand if they are trying to be offensive (e.g. ""go kill yourself you fucking faggot"") then they are trying to get a rise out of you and by getting offended you are letting them win.

As for personal speech I try to be reasonable and if I offend someone then I apologise. Different manners of speech are appropriate in different situations (e.g. i'm not about to call my boss a cuntwomble) and people should be aware of this. However, there is no point trying to censor your speech completely though because *someone* will find a way to be offended no matter what you say. I believe that different forms of language have different uses. Whilst language can be used in a bad way I do not believe that it can be inherently bad. I believe that attempts to reclaim such words are a noble cause and should be encouraged whenever possible as they are a superior alternative to censorship.

**Product claims:**  *""Age defying toner is specially designed to gently cleanse your skin while beginning to fight signs of ageing. Helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, improves surface skin dullness &amp; helps to noticeably smooth skin texture. Helps to maintain skin suppleness. Helps promote natural renewal of the skin's surface to reveal younger looking skin
Removes remaining traces of make up and impurities from the skin. Hydrates and softens skin.""*

**About you:** Since having my baby girl my skin has gone haywire. Cystic acne &amp; PIH plus a few fine lines that I want rid of. I'd used Simple KTS toner but when I finished my last bottle I spent a while researching toners with Niacinamide &amp; this was my choice as Niacinamide is the 2nd ingredient. 

**Your opinion:** I've been using this twice a day for a couple of weeks now &amp; could not love it more! It smells lovely but isn't overpowering to me at all. My skin feels very soft &amp; not at all dried out after using it- I forgot to moisturise one night after using this &amp; could not tell as my skin was still soft &amp; plumped up in the morning. It's too early to say if it is helping reduce my PIH or fine lines but I am noticing that my skin looks &amp; feels smoother &amp; more supple. On the whole I am very impressed so far.

Who is specifically to blame isn't that important; a bitch fight over it won't get us anywhere.

In our first 7 games this season, we have left one player up field, at most, to chase down the clear. Plenty of times, all 11 of our players are in the box defending off the corner.

This defensive mentality has left the box overcrowded on corners and free kicks. This has led to far too much ball watching and not enough space being covered, as our players seem to occupy the same spots, with 2/3 players going for the same ball constantly.

My point is that if he's a lone striker there are five midfielders and they have to do the job of linking to him, not the other way around. If he comes back there's no one up the field. How many times has he received the ball five yards from touch on the left with no one ahead of him and no one in the middle? Where do we go from there?

The answer to this point has been an attempt to dribble inside against a fullback, center half and defensive mid all closing with no threat behind them. It's that or cycle all the way back through our defense. Lallana/Coutinho/Allen need to be given that space and Balotelli has to be an option for them. With two strikers one can roam but as a lone outlet he needs to be focused on getting into the penalty area as often as possible. Every striker comes back to get the ball sometimes but I would like to see him seeking the ball less and space more.

This isn't a new criticism of him, either. His non-penalty goal scoring rate isn't great and there are people who will tell you it's because he doesn't spend a ton of time in the penalty area.

The 1882 campaign is a start (though even at some of those games I notice pockets of quiet that I hadn't expected), but they won't give up a whole block for them in league games because of the season ticket holders, who are as much to blame for the lack of atmosphere as anyone. I can't afford a season ticket but try and get along about once a month and it's shameful. I usually sit in the East Upper and try to sing up, but when no one around you will join in you just cant help but peter out.

Sunday - I went to the game - typified what is so frustrating. I was about a third of the way along the pitch in the East/South and not a sole was singing, even when the South stand were singing up. The guy immediately to my right spent the entirety of the game talking to the person next to him (about his job, boringly) and every time I glanced across at him, he was looking at the person he was speaking to and not at the game. The guy immediately in front of me made no noise other than to angrily (and loudly) shout whenever a mistake was made on the pitch. Did he sing? Did he, fuck. As soon as the whistle went a guy a few seats down from me started angrily kicking the seat in front of him, but he hadn't made a peep during the game.

I try to be a good fan. I never boo the team - not during, not after - and never leave early*. I don't even bugger off a few minutes before half time because not queuing for a drink is more important than seeing the game. I join in with the chants, even if no one else is. But I feel like I'm in a minority of one. Also frustrating is the fact that every game sells out on the website, but when you are there, there are hundreds of empty seats, so not only do you have people turning up and barely supporting their team, but a lot who buy tickets but don't even bother going. Again, I assume they pay for the season ticket to be able to go to the big games, but don't bother with the small ones.

I think that the cost of season ticket (what are we, second in the price table?) has created a stadium of people to whom it is just important to be a season ticket holder, rather than a football fan. A bigger stadium won't, I don't think, help. There'll just be more of the same.

Both Lambert and Mario are quality players. The problem the system the players are asked to play in.

I can see Mario learning quickly and is already adapting, so I think he'll come good once he is properly ""trained"" by BR. Lambert I think will always be the ""sub brought in to give the other team something to think about"", and coupled with his age, is never going to become another Sturridge style player.

Lallana played better last night, but he is the most puzzling BR acquisition. He is quality of course, but he is an ill-fit -- as you pointed out he hangs on to the ball for too long. In other words, he is too slow for our system (I've always said that, and keeps getting downvoted for it).  I think he will do better playing deeper, like a less energetic Henderson but one with more dribbling skills.

Markavic has not impressed so far, but it's 2 games into his season, and he has to adapt to the PL, a new system, new teammates, so I am going to not judge too quick.

&gt;God dammit, I hate reddit sometimes.


&gt;Ok, let's get one thing straight right off the bat: an air campaign without the assistance of knowledgable and technically skilled people on the ground to serve in a Forward Observer capacity, preferably with the assistance of local forces serving in a liaison/advisory role to their efforts is an INCREDIBLY ineffective way to do business. Allow me to use one example from my own personal experience in counter insurgency:


&gt;When I was serving as an advisor to the Afghan National Army two years ago we had UAS (drones) observe some guys digging on a road that was a notorious hotspot for IED's. In the middle of the night, we had positive observation of them moving around in the culverts and ditches in what kkkkinnndddaaa appeared to be a tactical method and digging small holes on the side of a road, appearing to do some work in the hole, and then covering it back up and moving to other spots. Other guys would then move forward in the same area and do the same activity. Literally every American watching, including myself, thought ""ACF (Anti-Coalition Forces) Militia emplacing IED's. FOR SURE. No doubt about it. Light those bastards up."" Fortunately, our battle space owner, a full bird Colonel, had the wisdom to hold off on the itchy trigger finger and contact his Afghani liaisons. As it turned out, in that area, farmers only had access to irrigation ditches for certain periods of time and farmers would go out, dig quickly down to the pipes that irrigated their fields, turn on their water access, irrigate the fields, then turn the pipes off and cover them back up and have the process repeat itself with a different farmer nearby. TL;DR - The ""ACM"" we were positive we were watching emplace IED's on a notorious route were just farmers irrigating their fields. This is just one small anecdote that shows how literally hundreds of different activities and things can look VVVVEERRRYYY different from 30,000 feet up through a thermal lens. Ever heard of the saying: ""When your a hammer... everything looks like a nail""?

&gt;Well, when you're 30K feet up looking for targets over Raqqa... all those ants running around on the ground look like a lot of nails. It takes smart people with street smarts and, most of all, a detailed knowledge of local ""patterns of life"" to determine what is and is not actually a nail. JTAC's, FO's, SOF personnel with local contacts sitting next to them as they designate actual targets with SOFLAMs (Special Operations Forces Laser Acquisitions Markers... laser pointers that can guide bombs on target).

&gt;It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from the book ""This Kind of War"" that I was forced to read ad nauseum as a Lieutenant in Korea.... ""Americans in 1950 rediscovered something that since Hiroshima they had forgotten: you may fly over a land forever; you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and wipe it clean of life—but if you desire to defend it, protect it and keep it for civilization, you must do this on the ground, the way the Roman legions did, by putting your young men in the mud.""

&gt;I am not advocating American ""boots on the ground"" (a cliche that I hate, btw) I am merely pointing out that to be effective in ""degrading or destroying"" (a very, very, very, very ambiguous term that our president has chosen to use as the mission statement for this adventure) you need people who know who the ""bad guys"" are because we live in an era where they do not (usually) wear uniforms, drive tanks, fly flags or readily identify themselves as targets because they are fully aware of the capabilities of Americas conventional military assets in targeting things like that. It's like how T.E. Lawrence put it, ""Fighting insurgencies is like eating soup with a knife... It's messy and slow.""

&gt;Bottom line, this is a fucking awfully messy, tricky situation with no clear solution.... ISIS is clearly trying to bait us into a messy ground war. Maybe that's the only thing that will ""destroy or degrade"" their forces but it's a dicey situation all around with no real answers. Reminds me of what a Colonel talking about counter insurgency to my advisor team before we deployed told us... ""This shit is a mess... It's complicated and nuanced and layered and anytime anybody tells you that they have it figured it out... they are wrong and dangerous because there are probably multiple layers of second and third order effects that they aren't thinking about when advocating a certain course of action.""
I, for one, am simply sitting here praying for our brave men and women in the air over Syria and the tens of thousands of largely innocent Syrian men and women that have no place to run to and are caught in the cross fire right now.

&gt;Stop banging the war drums and cheering each and every JDAM that hits Raqqa. Stop saying this is some sort of conspiracy to topple Assad (one of ISIS's primary foes and a guy who is probably relieved to see US air power hitting one of the most militarily capable and dangerous components of the revolt against him.) The simple fact of the matter is that nobody really has a clear idea of what's going on on the ground right now and that's the scariest part of all of this. If you say anything else, you're either dumb or seriously ill informed.

As to your question about what she lied about, here are a few examples (some with proof, some without - luckily I've kept every email and text I've exchanged with her):

After reporting a fault with my bed, she (at a later date) told me to my face that nobody else had said anything, despite the fact that I made the complaint in no small part due to a housemate, who'd been there longer, informing me that it wasn't an isolated incident. I've asked said housemate to try to track down their proof of the incident.

I've been accused of not paying rent, though this has never been the case. I tried to set up a standing order, but through some reason neither I nor my bank can explain, it was rejected. I have since paid the rent personally each month, with receipts. Receipts I have kept on my person at all times, except for when I showed the representative in person. She also claimed I never informed her of the issues with the standing order, which I can also prove false through email+text evidence.

We have been several times accused of not keeping the communal areas tidy for the cleaners when they come in. The most recent was this week, when the cleaners were in and out in less than one hour (I was at home, but they didn't know that), and had made sure to thoroughly prepare the communal areas personally the night before, after everybody had gone to bed.

Anyway who's to blame isn't really important.

For example, his energy ""price freeze"". If he had the interests of the country at heart instead of his beloved Labour party, he'd have waited until Labour's election manifesto is published to announce it, instead of single handedly destroying investment in energy infrastructure for 2 years. He announced it when he did because energy prices were constantly in the news for months and he thought he could get some political capital. This is how Ed operates.

The beheading soldiers, trying to bomb army barracks, tubes, buses. The killing in general I feel is a bit much.

false,djimonia,lfc99,,"There's a reason we went after Remy, as a like-for-like replacement for the qualities Studge brings to the team if he is out injured or a way to play with a quick two up top who give the opposing defenders more to think about.  
  
With Balotelli, I agree that it's looking more on the Carroll side of the spectrum, but it's just a different style of play. Suarez did three huge things for us apart from score goals for fun. He pressed up top superbly (and by this I mean he occasionally also *won* the ball, not just forced a pass which any fit, decently fast striker can be asked to do), he won us lots of fouls (and we scored from plenty of direct and indirect freekicks last season) and most of all, he was ridiculously unpredictable (or unstoppable even when predictable but that's just world class being world class).  

With Balotelli, you can get standard pressing, you can win some fouls since he likes to play with his back to the goal or running at you from the left wing (and like suarez, discount his success rate because of his reputation) but most of all you have a fairly unpredictable player. Is he going to wallop it? Is he going to take it first time, or control and shoot or dribble? Is he going to make a run in behind or drop deep? He has the talent to execute what he makes up as he goes along but the issue with unpredictable players is that they are also the hardest to gel in to a demanding style of play.   
  
If they're unpredictable to you watching them on TV, then they certainly are to everyone else in the team. Add in 5-6 players who've played less than a month together and even less on the pitch and you have a recipe for horrible miscommunication and organisation.  
  
It'll take some time for Balo and Rodgers to evolve a style but it's harder with the pressure for him to play up top (which he doesn't do or want to do as he's said as much himself while at Inter) in Studge's absence and with so many new players playing at the same time.  
  
Once players like Allen, Can and Studge are back fit, you'll see more of the Liverpool we like and until then, expect us to swing wildly between first half West Ham and the Spurs game - or basically, just be Spurs from last year when they had a starting XI with 5-6 new players in it each week, which was their choice but wasn't our plan until injuries piled up. I'm prepared for that rollercoaster, but still hope we can sit deeper and grind out some 1-0s rather than setting up for hopeful 5-0s or 6-3s like we used to. 

Rodgers will need to figure out how to use Balotelli better but more importantly, he need to figure out a system that allows us to cope when we are forced to field tactically inflexible (but still very useful) players like Lucas, Lambert and Gerrard in our XI, as well as those with attacking and/or defensive responsibilities who are still learning how we play like Lallana, Lovren, Markovic and Moreno. 
  
(Re Gerrard, I call him tactically inflexible because he has only one role in the club right now - CDM and his and Rodgers' expectation is that he will only play there. He's obviously a stellar player, so this is not a criticism of his qualities or performance)",0,1411575828,null,0,1411576861,0,ckrbp9r,t3_2hb95a,t1_ckrbp9r,t3_2hb95a,null,1426844576,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

There are lot of dodgy things going on but to say that Chelsea are breaking any rules is really a stretch.

Partly because it is in FIFA's interests to have 3rd parties and make as much money for the individuals within FIFA. I don't really understand those who complain about Chelsea or owners without realising how complicit organisations like FIFA are.

They know the reason why Britain is a comparative economic success among its neighbours is because they got rid of that toff. France didn't, Germany did, look where the two of those are now.

What this writer wants is a return to the 1983 Labour manifesto. It was at the forefront of what socialism demanded at the time - strike protections, closed shop, power to the unions, more nationalisations, unilateral nuclear disarmament, an exit from the EC. **And it didn't have the slightest hope of being elected**. ""The longest suicide note in history"", they called it. Labour must be the left-of-centre alternative in the area of what the British people want - and this includes Southerners. It can't be a fringe party.

I'll be voting Labour come 2015, because I appreciate their positions on the NHS and on Europe.

* Liverpool's losses over the 2011-2013 period were greater than those allowed by FFP regulations

* Exemptions are made for Youth Development and Stadium Development

* Inter Milan, Roma and Monaco are also being investigated.

* There will be no transfer embargo's or fines, the punishment Liverpool could receive is a reduction or complete withdrawal of any Champions League earnings from the 2014/15 season.

* Liverpool are expected to put the losses down to the costs incurred from the plans for the Stanley Park Stadium and the newer stadium refurbishments, which would exempt these costs and bring them under the threshold for the regulations.

* So basically, don't worry, we'll hopefully be fine!

There's nothing stopping City, or any team, from fielding an entire team of academy players in the C1 Cup. That would not only give the likes of Aguero some rest, but also give young prospects some great first-team experience. And City do have some great young players who could benefit hugely from that experience - not to mention the fringe players who might otherwise get restless without a run-out.

So for these reasons I'd say the C1 Cup games are actually pretty useful - invaluable, even. Sure, City might lose with a weakened team, but it doesn't really matter: the C1 Cup's far from a priority (I seem to remember Soriano saying that it wouldn't even count towards the one-trophy-per-season target), defeat still brings the afforementioned upsides, and hey, it would also solve the fixture-congestion problem in a jiffy.",0,1411581712,null,0,false,0,ckrex4q,t3_2hbxt6,t1_ckrex4q,t1_ckrbj65,null,1426843006,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

_____

&gt; He was charged with 13 counts, he was found not guilty of 12 of them.

And he was found guilty of an indecent assault. That's kind of important.

&gt; The one he was found guilty of, a previous jury had failed to reach a verdict on before, in other words they had failed to see enough evidence to find him guilty 

Uh oh, you're not going to do what I think you're going to do?

&gt; ... which should have meant he was found not guilty.

Oh dear.    
'They didn't reach a verdict' != 'being found not guilty'. This jury did reach a verdict, by the way: he was found guilty of an indecent assault.     
Hmmm you're not working in law, amirite? Or maybe you tried and failed? Either way: it's somewhat obvious.

&gt; He has had this trial and uncertainty hanging over him for 2 years. 

Yep. And now he's been found guilty of an indecent assault. Should we point out at this juncture that his victim has had it hanging over her for 20 years? Also: he was found guilty of an indecent assault.

&gt; He's had scores of people coming forward accusing him of things that he has been found not to have committed by the courts.

Again, I'm not sure that you're anywhere near the legal profession.       
But yes: he was found not-guilty on those counts. And he was found guilty of an indecent assault.     
I have to wonder if you'd be so annoyed (irate?) if he'd been found guilty on two counts. What about three? Four or five? Heck, if he'd been found not guilty on just one would you be spitting feathers?

&gt; Could you remember what you did on an exact day 20 years ago?

Nope, but then again I wasn't in the habit of groping 22 year olds when I was 10. I'm still not even now. You?

&gt; Could you remember it in such detail as to prove that a 5 second incident didn't happen?

It doesn't work like that, I'm afraid, but I'd hope I'd remember if I was/had been in the habit of groping young women. And you'll recall that there were witnesses for the prosecution: Dave Gorman &amp; Peter Kessler, who corroborated the victim's story of mentioning it at the time. By the by, that's quite a long game/long shot she was playing, if it was all bullshit. And all for no personal gain... Weird, innit?! And so he was found guilty of an indecent assault.

&gt; When even the identity of the person accusing you is kept quiet until very late on? 

Wait - does that have a bearing on the case: the public being told the identity of the victim? Here's a question: Why do you think that that sort of thing might be kept private? Have a think. Got it yet? OK I'll give you a bit longer.      
Not that it matters: the court knew who she was. And so does everyone who has the BBC news article, access to google and 30 seconds. I know it, not least because I heard her make the accusation in a by-the-by way on a podcast over 2 years ago. Super-secretive!

If you don't like the result of the court case, I suggest you take it up with the judge and/or authorities. Either that or take the long and winding road down the career path so you can eventually defend all these poor old men from the heinous accusations of the numerous women (and some men) 'crawling out of the woodwork after all these years'. I get the impression you're the kind of person who wonders: ""Why haven't all these people/women come forward before?"" If so, I'll tell you: it's because of people like you.

&gt; You can use ""SEXUAL ASSAULT"" repeatedly to try and appeal to emotions but what he did was about as minor as it is possible to be whilst still being charged with the crime.

Ah and so it becomes clear: You *are* actually a massively shitty person with regard to this particular opinion. I don't say that lightly by the way, even though I qualified it: I realise how even the words of a vaguely anonymous internet person can be spikey sometimes, but fucking hell... You actually believe the shit that's coming out of your brain? You even CAPITALISE that I said ""sexual assault"" (my mistake - I should have earlier said ""indecent assault"") to try and imply I'm some kind of hand-wringing do-gooder... There is something wrong with this section of your personality. Seriously. It's bust.

But what hijinks is this!? Appealing to emotions, you say? You *just* said this!

&gt; He has had this trial and uncertainty hanging over him for 2 years. 

Physician, heal-thyself!

It's an obvious, underhand and shitty tactic to try and dismiss the recent bout of allegations, court-cases and convictions of old men who have finally been caught up with for taking advantage of their past positions of power, in the way you've been trying to do: It was ages ago. It wasn't that bad. It was only a grope. He was found not-guilty on most counts. It's all about emotion. It's about revenge.

Wah, wah: Boo-fucking-hoo: I only wanted to touch some boobies and it was aaaaaaaaaages ago! sniffle.    
You even think you're working from compassion for the ""victim"" of the justice system... utterly FUBAR.

&gt; The way this trial has happened frankly stinks and the ends, a single conviction of one of the most minor sexual offences the law can bring (perhaps only second to indecent exposure), in no way justifies the journey to get there.

I think I addressed all the 'important' bullshit that fills up this sentence above. The rest of it is your issue with the law and media. But if you want to skip to the end now, be my guest.

&gt; I've done nothing but argue about the facts of the cases...

What I've seen you do mostly is restate particular points (not-guilty on 12 counts) and fail to give proper weight to others (he was found guilty of an indecent assault). ""Facts""... Seems to be an awful lot of opinion mainly based around you not liking that someone was found guilty of an indecent assault given that they were found not-guilty on others. Do you feel the same way about Rolf Harris, or Max Clifford, or Stuart Hall, or will about the others that may be convicted on similar matters in the future?     
How many ""not-guilty"" counts outweighs a guilty?

&gt; ...you've done nothing but launch personal attacks.

Eh? Up until this point I think I've only had two comments pointed at you. One was very rude, yes: I made a colourful comment initially but deleted it within a couple of minutes as I decided to engage you instead. That was via a question further down the thread which at the moment hasn't had a response:

&gt; [In what way are such things ""harmful""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2h88m6/exdj_travis_guilty_of_sex_assault/ckqe2i8)

It's a toughy, ain't it? But I realise how hurtful such a question must be. I can only apologise: I don't know how I even brought myself to attack your personality with such vigour and dis-abandon.

Unless you're referring to the above comment?:

&gt; I'm inclined to think it's demonstrative of certain personality traits

Well yeah... You have some issues. Take a second to have a think about why 1) victims of indecent assault are very unlikely to take the position you are here and 2) whether or not you'd think differently if you were a victim of indecent assault, even if it was X years ago. And if you can manage 2), consider whether you'd feel the same if you weren't a man. Because you are, aren't you? So am I, but I'd hope that wouldn't matter in making you try and understand the point I'm making here.

So yes, I'll give you the satisfaction of being the bigger person, and not having to throw mud around even though to be honest I'd be much more embarrassed if people found out I had your views than if I was swearing at grannies, for example. 

But given that I highly suspect you're not really in the business of taking the side of sexual/indecent assault victims I'll even give you the chance to ignore everything I've said: You're essentially excusing indecent assault - for whatever reason - and seeing as you apparently want to be a victim (*personal attacks!*) even though you're airing some pretty shitty views, I'll give you a variation of the original comment I left which I quickly deleted in favour of trying to engage you (silly me! now I know better):

Go fuck yourself. 

You've done nothing but try and play down an indecent assault: ""5 second incident""... ""he was found not guilty of 12 of them""... ""identity of the person accusing... is kept quiet""... ""one of the most minor sexual offences the law can bring""... ""shove an old man in jail for a grope using potential victims feelings""...

I have to wonder: is it just when it's old men touching up young women that you seem to think should be given a free-pass? How about rape but so long as it's committed 30 years ago? These are rhetorical questions, because to be quite honest [when it comes to your further thoughts on this matter...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-Gzgd88HKA)

You are never going to sell people on increased tax. Especially when there is so much waste in the system.

By waste, I don't mean benefits to the disabled. I'm talking about govt subsidies to grouse moor farmers (the Sultan of Dubai gets £250,000 from us for his grouse moor farm in Scotland), subsidies to landowners for wind-farms. Subsidies to farmers for keeping their land fallow. Subsidies to Virgin Rail. Millions paid to ""consultants"".

And so on and so forth.

Businesses shouldn't need subsidies. If they can't manage without help from the taxpayer, something is wrong with their business model and they should go bust, thereby freeing their staff and capital for another company with a model that works.

Tax money should only go to the NHS, education, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and state pensions. That's all. The rest should have a big axe put to it.

Who knows, we might then find a way to improve the core services *and* provide a tax cut if we cease payments to the rentier class.

&gt;

&gt;__Ian Richard Kyle Paisley, Baron Bannside__, [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council) (6 April 1926 – 12 September 2014) was a [Unionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_unionism) politician and [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism) religious leader from [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).

&gt;He became a Protestant evangelical minister in 1946 and would remain one for the rest of his life. In 1951 he co-founded the fundamentalist [Free Presbyterian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Ulster) and was its leader until 2008. Paisley became known for his fiery speeches and regularly preached and protested against [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism) and homosexuality. He gained a large group of followers who were referred to as 'Paisleyites'.

&gt;Paisley became involved in [Ulster unionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_unionism)/[loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) politics in the late 1950s. In the mid-late 1960s he led and instigated loyalist opposition to the [Catholic civil rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_civil-rights_movement_(1960s\)) in Northern Ireland. This [led to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#Late_1960s) the outbreak of [the Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) in the late 1960s; a conflict that would engulf Northern Ireland for the next thirty years. In 1970 he became [Member of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom\)) for [North Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Antrim_(UK_Parliament_constituency\)) and the following year he founded the [Democratic Unionist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party) (DUP), which he would lead for almost forty years. In 1979 he became a [Member of the European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament).

false,KaiserMacCleg,null,null,"The linked map shows an agreement struck between Owain Glyndŵr and his English allies - the Mortimer and Percy families - to divide the Kingdom between them if they were successful in their rebellion. Of course, they weren't, and soon after the indenture was signed there was little hope left for any of them.

A little context:

Prior to Glyndwr's rebellion, the reigning King of England, Richard II, had been usurped and starved to death by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, who became Henry IV - the first Lancastrian King. Henry's was to be a troubled reign, facing down numerous rebellions including that of Glyndwr and his allies. 

Glyndwr made common cause with Sir Edmund Mortimer, a powerful marcher lord with a stronger claim on the English throne than Henry's own, after capturing him in battle. Henry IV became suspicious that Edmund had planned to be captured, and began seizing the estates of the wider Mortimer family while refusing his kinsmen, the Percys, the right to seek a ransom.

Soon thereafter, Edmund was married to Glyndwr's daughter Catrin and joined Glyndwr in his rebellion, with the intent of placing his nephew, another Edmund, on the throne of England.

The Percys, who had been pursuing their own efforts to dethrone Henry,  rebelled in 1403 and marched south to join with Glyndwr and Mortimer. King Henry moved to intercept them, however, and defeated the Percys' army in a closely-fought battle outside Shrewsbury. 

In 1405, the alliance between the Percys, Mortimers and Glyndwr was still alive, and was formalised in the Tripartite Indenture, an agreement to divide the Kingdom between them should they win. In reality, however, their fight was almost over.

It really doesn't cost very much, say we elect 5-8 people per region on 40k a year there's 400,000 per region lets * it by 8 for the regions and you get around 3.8 million, support staff would be about 20k per year and lets say 2 for every assembly member so lets double it to 7.4 million cost for having devolved assemblies. The benefits are not vague, how on earth could David Cameron know what needs to be spent and how it should be spent for every region/city in the UK? Your mad if you think it isn't money well spent.

Lottery postcode doesn't come into it, I said in my original post that some money would still go towards the UK pot and would be passed on to areas that need it more.

That is a bollocks argument and frankley your entire post is grasping at strawman arguments as to why de-evolution isn't a good idea.

false,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"It could well be the wheel balance but it could just as easily not be. 

My Hornet has a tendency to do it when the front tyre becomes worn - how new are your tyres/how many miles have they done? Any flat spots/wearing patterns on the shoulders? What are the pressures? 

First check the alignment of your back wheel - it sounds counter intuitive but if your back wheel is really out of line then it can cause a wobble as the bike tries to realign the front wheel with the badly aligned back wheel. If your chain is slack, that could be an indication that the back wheel isn't aligned properly so I'd start there first. 

The other thing is that often steering wobble can be a product of poorly set up or faulty suspension - when's the last time you had your forks serviced? If one has leaked fluid and the other hasn't that could cause an imbalance. Also check your front bearings, could be there's a side that is on its way out and so is causing uneven drag on your wheel - best way is to get the front in the air, grab the wheel from the top and bottom and move it up and down and from side to side - any play and your bearings need to be replaced. To check if they're moving properly, unbolt your brake caliper and use a bungie to hook it out of the way so the wheel spins freely. Spin the front wheel and make sure there's no drag on it - it should make a good few revolutions after a stout spin otherwise you've got knackered bearings.

Why couldn't Davros just make another seed? 

An entire overarching theme from the entire show is that no matter what happens the universe keeps going (School Reunion, Into the Dalek, et al). So while the theory of a Dalek cleansed universe may work for a while, eventually time and life itself would take over leading back to the exact same scenario as now.

Daleks already have time travel and have used it, I don't believe it was stolen at all. 

Daleks have killed millions of stars and galaxies, we only see the few that get stopped by the Doctor, they still succeed a lot. They were winning on Gallifrey. 

The Daleks only hate Time Lords because of the Doctor, otherwise they'd probably have fought eventually but it likely wouldn't be at the scale that we saw in the Time War. Maybe, eventually, when the Time Lords realized they were a huge threat that needed to be stopped. 

Interuniverse travel is nearly impossible without the Time Lords.

Who says the Adam Dalek wouldn't be corrupted or damaged and wind up like Rusty? 

Would the Daleks have planned for other life in their universe?

A recent example is of Nicola Sturgeon when she announced she would be standing to be the next FM, and people claimed that she wouldn't be taken seriously by the electorate because she looks frumpy. If she was deemed to be attractive, there would be pictures plastered all over. A similar thing happened with one Tory MP, I forget her name now, but all the coverage of her election was 'look how fit she is laaads'. And Blair's Babes.

Det brukar börja någonstans därborta, sen sprids det till andra delar av stadion beroende på matchsituationer och sånt. När det väl sätter igang kan Loftus Road bli sjukt högljutt, även om det är den minsta stadion i PL. 

Vad gäller biljetter till hemmamatcher har jag inte superkoll, men andra här brukar föreslå att registrera sig på hemsidan och köpa därifrån (obs bara en biljett per medlem). Biljetter till Villa matchen borde släppas snart. Vet inte om det är möjligt att få tag i biljetter till R sektionen eftersom att det brukar vara säsongskortshållare som sitter där, men om ni är ute i god tid och ringer och frågar box officen kanske det går. Om inte, kolla Viagogo – dyrare, men sannolikheten att ni hittar bra biljetter där är mycket större. Undvik att köpa på matchdagen dock.

Om ni vill uppleva lite stämning innan matchen är det bäst att ta tunnelbanan till Shepherd’s Bush istället för White City och sen gå därifrån. På Uxbridge Road ligger det en massa pubbar var fansen brukar hänga innan matchen, varav the White Horse är min favorit. Den ni inte får missa är the Springbok på South Africa Road precis utanför stadion, men ni kommer nog få visa biljett för att komma in.

Salah... Disappointing really. Having too many touches when he should shoot, and his passes seem very accidental.

Schurrle - Good off the ball, but a little selfish. Refusing to link up with Luis, and would rather dribble the ball in for a shot. would be ok if he had his shooting boots on, because he just can't seem to produce the final product.

Oscar - Selfless as always, maybe a bit too much, but it kind of balences out the selfishness of Salah and Andre.

Remy - Not outstanding. Doing what he can though. Not a lot of deliveries from Schurrle and Salah, so you can't really blame him...

Mikel - A little more attacking minded than usual, and has been ok. Got his dribbling skills up and running though, maybe because we are just playing against bolton, so he is much confident.

Cahill - nothing different.

The only silver lining of all of this is that Pochettino seems to realize that no matter how poor Eriksen and Lamela are playing, they are probably better than Townsend and Lennon, so hopefully they will continue to get tons of games. Don't think Townsend has been that poor tonight though. Don't rate him but would rather keep him than Lennon. 

This flies in the face of things I've said in the past, but I honestly think we need to rebuild this squad...again. Not in one summer, but over the course of 3 full seasons. Let Pochettino cut bait with anyone he doesn't like and bring people in who he can motivate.

Honestly the fucking TRIPE that I read on this website has made me a lot more reluctant to be a 'lefty'. How you all believe it's happy days we don't need trident when Russia is fingering Ukraine and China is currently on stereoids, whereas we're just getting old kicking back unable to protect ourselves.. it's just nice knowing that as the grandad of the world we'd have a fucking AUTOMATIC CLIP FED DESERT EAGLE STASHED UNDER OUR TWEED JACKET if roided China chats shit or Russia thinks he can rape a gorgeous woman infront of us (invade Finland or something). 

The world isn't all roses, who here genuinely gives a fuck and cries at night about people in the congo being slaughtered by local militia? Nobody gives a fuck about you if you become a shadow of your former self. It's like in our lives, if you quit work tomorrow and sad at home depressed drinking away all your savings until you were in a bedsit and then out on the streets smoking rocks with the other crack heads and injecting puddle water with mixed smack into your vains, nobody would really care. 

We have to look after ourselves and remain relevant. Trident helps us, it's like as I say.. a fucking belt fed desi stashed under our jacket. 

And I drive over 90miles a day. I don't wanna pay extra for fuel in my car. We're going to be towards electric cars anyway, but they'll be done right. Electric cars that still ROAR when you rev the engine, electric cars that leave any other petrol cars in the fucking distance when you take off at lights hitting 40mph in 1second. Who would want an old petrol car then? Nobody. Politics taxing people such as myself for simply driving doesn't concern me. 

The fact that we have no third lane on the M62 and in the morning I'm sat in STATIC TRAFFIC DUE TO INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE FUCKING INFURIATES ME EVERY MORNING. This is what I want, as a scouser who is constantly in Manchester near enough every day on business I cannot be fucking arsed with bullshit any more. 

Politics as a whole, is unbelievable bullshit. But the party who is chatting the least bullshit out of all the other parties, not to say they don't still chat shit but that party for me is UKip. They just seem like people who tell it is how it is. Telling it how it is 'um bongo land' etc lands them in deep waters, but I honestly laugh at that stuff.. because it doesn't matter if some old fella says 'um bongo land', it's just a term he's used off handedly without thinking. 

Labour sold all our gold, did nothing to stop the ghetto communities I see arising in my home city full of poor people who do seem to have a completely alien culture, i.e. muslim dress, standing around on street corners past the age of 20, talking foreign languages in public. We've got British born lads beheading American journalists in the middle east. This is solely our government failing immigration policies, UKip would stand up and address that without fear of being singled out as racist, which sadly is a term too easily thrown around these days. 

One of the most fucking driven people in our work is South African, he's an absolute legend and somebody I cannot express how highly I think of him and how much as a country we need this guy. He's delivering unbelievable performance for the department we work in and he could sit with the most depressed prick on reddit and have them training to run a marathon and winning it in a month. He's just a beast. When I told him I vote UKip he looked at me so disapointed and thought I was racist.. upon explaining why, he said he is as he agrees with the same notions/principles.

false,cametosayshadk,null,null,"I would recommend reading ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" by George Samuel Clason for a crash course on how you should view money and saving etc.

Unless you're living in London, your salary is solid and you should have no problem clearing your debts reasonably quickly. Work out which one has the highest % of interest and smash that first. I suspect it's your credit card. Make sure you make any minimum payments regardless to avoid charges etc. Choose a level of repayment that works for you - personally I like to cutback on everything and clear debts quickly, rather than drag it out but you'll need to choose an approach that is realistic for you.

Although it's painful, keep a spreadsheet with *every single penny* you spend on it for a few months, and classify each expense into things like ""food"", ""bills"", ""rent"" etc. You'll find somewhere you're pissing your money away, and it'll be easy to fix when it's laid out in front of you. (For example, when I actually tracked what I was spending on lunch each day, I was truly shocked. My yearly spend on alcohol was also a disgrace.)

Make sure you're getting a good deal on your mobile phone. Most people just splurge and get a 2 year contract paying £40-£50/month. This is ridiculous. You can just buy a decent handset outright, and get a 3/Giffgaff sim and pay about £12 a month. I have a state of the art handset which I buy every 18 months outright and resell, and it averages out to about £25/month.

For things that you can't avoid buying such as food, clothes, toiletries, try and do straight replacements for cheaper items for a while. You'd be surprised how good 'value' items can be these days.

Always use cashback deals for anything you want to buy wherever possible.

Once your debts are cleared, get in the habit of transferring at an absolute minimum 10% into a saving account as soon as you get paid. You won't even miss it, and it soon builds up.

Markovic is still raw and it shows from what we have seen with him. Burning pace and can dribble but when it comes to the final third i feel he becomes pretty wasteful and he seems scared to shoot at times, even though Markovic will most likely be the better player in the future i feel Suso is better than him at the moment.

I just don't see why Suso doesn't get chances. When he got a consistent run of games at Almeria he was their best player a lot of the time and started the season really well.

Ok, here it goes.

* With regard to the wobble when you take your hands off the bars, DONT TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE BARS. Seriously, riding with no hands is stupid. Your front tyre will follow the small imperfections in the road and wobble slightly. It's perfectly normal. The bike relies on your arms to absorb the small movements and keep the bike going in a straight line.

* With regard to the slight wobble with your hands ON the bars, check the alignment of your rear tyre (don't trust the markings on the swingarm, take measurements) and check your front wheel for wheel weights. Some tyre places won't put weights on small displacement bikes since they think it won't matter.

If in doubt, head to the Oval Motorcycle Centre.

false,FaithNoMoar,null,null,"One of the primary reasons for this question was the thought of how differently the UK and the US imbibe. I figured I'd leave the contrasting side here for anyone who's interested.

**TL;DR: Every American bar is free to sell what they want. Most bars sell the Big-Three beer brands and a rapidly growing trend is ""local"" craft beers. Maybe 5-10% of bars/pubs, in ""hip"" cities, sell craft beers *solely*. Rural and suburban America mostly drinks domestic lagers in their home, tied to a long history of blue-collar industry, the cause? Like so many of the world's greatest atrocities: the Germans.**

The majority of bars in the US have the top three breweries stocked: Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch), Coors, and Miller. Usually there are three or four distribution companies who cover one each of those brands. In Southern California there are a handful of large distributors like Crest (Coors), and Markstein (Budweiser) that cover an area (maybe a county or three). They each probably work with an importer to sell some of the English beers, Newcastle, Harp and Guinness; another might have Smithwick's and Bass, then other world beers will likewise be disbursed: one having Amstel, Carlsberg and Corona, another with Dos Equis, Stella Artois, and Heineken perhaps.

San Diego (county) specifically is a huge microbrew producer, I think the biggest (by number of breweries) in the US so we're probably closer to the UK in terms of ""types"" of bars though big cities like New York and Chicago, and ""trendy"" cities like Austin and Portland are comparable. A new type of place in those cities call themselves ale houses, gastropubs, publics and the like, rarely sell what we call ""domestics"" (Bud, Coors, Miller). These types of places are guaranteed to have a couple local staples like Stone, Ballast Point, or AleSmith then semi-local, microbrewed beers from Northern California, like Lagunitas, or Colorado craft beers, like Dale's or New York's Red Hook. Many of them are distributed by big microbrewers (oxymoron, I know) like Stone or a couple other ""independent"" distributors. Port Brewing Company, an offshoot of Pizza Port (a small pizza/pub chain), makes a ton of beers, some for other local restaurants and bars and also distributes quite a few beers in what's sort of like a co-op: all the little guys ganging up to take on the big guys.

Almost every bar now, even if they're primarily a ""domestic"", ""big 3"" beer seller, will have a couple local beers in a tap or two and a few local bottles at a minimum.

Regardless, every bar, whether it sells ""local"" or ""domestic"" is completely free, but may have a prefered distributor they work with, promoting one brand over another. One of the only reasons a bar wouldn't sell certain brands, is because they're the type of bar that people go to for local/craft beers. When a place has trumpeted a dozen or two ""local"" beers on draft, no one's there for a Bud Light and even if someone was, it would be sacrilegious for the ""gourmet"" bar to sell such ""lowbrow"" beer - even if the bar is genuinely lowbrow itself.

Milwaukee is an entirely different story since Miller (one of the top 3) is the local brewery yet the youth in the town are riding the craft brew wave. I get the impression that they're on their own system, and I imagine it's quite involved since the industry is so old there.

An interesting aside is that Miller has partnered with Coors (a huge competitor) to handle much of Miller's production in the West. Meanwhile, Miller also brews many other smaller domestic beers like Schlitz in Milwaukee. They don't however brew their partner Coors in return though, since Coors' trademark ""ingredient"" is Rocky Mountain water that's ""tapped in the Rockies"". A further aside: Coors sells its Rocky Mountain water to one of Colorado's craft bourbon distilleries (another growing trend amongst even the so called micro-*breweries*).

Coors probably relates to the Milwaukee dynamics since Coors is on one hand a Colorado state treasure, but on the other has been lumped in with ""American piss water"" like the other big two makers.

And for those wondering why the big American beers are all lagers: well, a mass of Germans immigrated in the middle of the 19th century and brought along beer recipes that were much lighter and more refreshing than the blue-collar working class was used to. With the advent of refrigeration around the same time, the choice between a heavy, tepid ale and a light refreshing, ""cold one"" (a notable American term for a frosty beer) at the end of a hard day at the steel mill or auto plant was an easy choice to make.

Of course the modern youth is much too cool for this ""yellow fuzzy beer"" (as Stone Brewing calls it) so the hipster pendulum (trendulum?!) has swung back to the darker spectrum, especially ales with high alcohol contents like IPA's, and double IIPA's.

Another poignant difference between the world's two closest allies: I would guess that somewhere around 75%-85% of beer in the US is consumed at home - a huge part no doubt due to the beer at the bar often costing quadruple. I'd imagine in the UK that the percentage of beer consumed at home is substantially lower, possibly even the inverse of US practices. I'm sure there are statistics on this, but I'm only privy to my limited travel experience and a short stint in retail liquor.

A lot of the current trends definitely have roots in British culture (real or perceived) especially in craft beer parlance. India Pale Ales, in spite of their namesake, were exclusively British, now something the farthest western states are becoming uniquely famous for (the unbalanced, West Coast IPA).

I have to say I'm glad all that shit is over, but man, what a rush! If you spent the last 4 months listening to dreary, uptight ideologues dutch-rudder each other then you missed out on a shitload of fun. 

There's always another side to the transaction though, and by the end I'd almost forgotten that it's all just kafabe. The amount of personal and intellectual dishonesty I indulged in during the course of the debate just to 'defeat' people I disliked took a heavy toll on my spriritual well-being.

But anyway, like I said in my snarky shitpost the other day - The position alluded to in this piece only makes sense if you're militant. If not, it's the political equivalent of a 14-year-old emo kid throwing his birthday presents back at mum and dad because ""everything is shit anyway.""

Comparing my experiences of the MSc SE course with friends who did CS at Bristol (at both BSc and MSc level), their course was a lot more based around fundamentals, taught with more academic rigour and research focus. 

It is undoubtedly the case that UoB is a more respected research institution than UWE but the latter does publish some good things from the AIRG and from the Robotics Labs (in collaboration with the former).

As far as reputation in the workplace (I've spent 7 years in industry as a developer at various grades in three places), if you're going for a pretty bog-standard developer job, most employers don't care. Healthcare and academia, on the other hand, do seem to care!

Overall, UoB is just a nicer place to be than UWE - the location is better, the facilities are generally better and so are the surroundings. If you see your time as university as a stepping stone to a decent job in industry, then UWE is fine.

Who is the best player?  
 - Steven Gerrard, we just sold Luis Suarez for 80-60mil pounds or so, he was our best player. Arguements can be made for sterling or sturridge at this point in time. 

 How good is the team compared to the rest of the EPL?   

 They are in the secondary teir of 3rd-to-7th in terms of talent. They finished 2nd last year, and I personally think ManCity and Chelsea are a cut above the rest at 1 and 2. 

Are they historically one of the best teams in EPL history?  
 Yes, admittedly they have not won the League for around 15 years (1990), they have won the league 18 times, and the European Cup, sorta-like-a super bowl of football but with no regular season, and only the best teams get in, 5 times, more than any other English team. For more on this read the info links on the right side of this reddit thread.

ManUnited is the other historically successful club, they have won the league 19* times, and have only 1 European Cup.

 Are there chants I should know?    


 you should know 'You'll Never Walk Alone"" and ""We are Liverpool"" both of which the crowd sings in the new FIFA 15 video game, (which is probably one the best ways to learn about the team besides internet research). You can always learn them all: 
http://www.anfield-online.co.uk/features/lfcsongs.htm
  
also the Gerrard song is a good one to know. 

Do I support the team by saying ""go Liverpool!"" or is there some other way to correctly do it?  
 I would refrain from that (very american). Maybe the occasional 'Ooooo' or 'Ahhh' is in-order for a great play, and clapping when defenders do something brilliant, or hustle and don't give up, is always good. the occational 'CMON Danny-Boy' never goes amiss, and 'Cmon you Reds!"" is another popular one. You can always sing...mostly its just screaming when something great happens.
  
  
 What is a game at Anfield like?  

Never been, I will one day. Its probably amazing.  

   What is the city of Liverpool like?   Sorta like a cross between Boston and Philadelphia. Its a port city, who lost its major industries with the coming of the information age. Yet it has heart, and stuff. And the Beatles are from there ..

Who are our biggest rivals and why?   Everton is like our little brother. And Man United is our Arch Rivals who we hate.   

How much are tickets to games on average?  Not exactly sure, depends on where you sit obviously, I think if you buy them from the club by being a supporter its like 100$.  Its hard to get tickets outside of being a supporter, unless you want to play like 500$ (plus more $ for other stuff) for a 'hospitality ticket' which are one-off tickets that have like hotels and everything booked into them.

 Why are YOU a fan of the club?  I could probably go the longest on this one, but short answer is that they have heart. They aren't the 'favorites', they remind me alot of rooting for a Philadelphia team.  Probably helps that they wear red like the Phillies. They have Steven Gerrard, who basically is from Liverpool, been at the club since age 12 (in the little kid academys) and he became the best player in the league, got offered buckets of money to leave (plus winning trophies at a better team), and turned it down...Hes the Captain, the tailisman, the leader, the best in everything you could possibly want. Plus he hates DJ's who don't play phil colins, eff those guys.

There are specifications that have nothing on the US and specifications that do much more.

false,SHOOPDAWOOPLOL,lfcflame,,"You can find loads of info, like player bios and info on the history of the club on the clubs official website at http://www.liverpoolfc.com

The best player at the club currently is probably a toss up between Raheem Sterling (19 year old, (yes, 19) winger/forward) and Daniel Sturridge (Striker, 2nd highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season, second only to Luis Suarez, who just left the ckub for Barcelona in the summer)


Compared to the rest of the League, we can certainly stack up against the top teams when we play at our best, but we currently seem to lack the sheer amount of world class players that teams like Manchester City and Chelsea have, that said, we have some brilliant players in our first team, but our problems seem to be with backup players and players that make an impact off the bench.

Historically, Liverpool are the most successful team in England. You can check out a lot of the history of the club in the subreddit's sidebar, under the ""Information"" section. That includes songs, videos of historic matches, and descriptions of club heroes and legends.

Biggest rivals:

Manchester United (The Mancs/The Scum) - Why? There's always been a rivalry between the two cities, and Liverpool and Man United are the two most successful teams in England. Also, their fans, players and staff are cunts, so we don't like them very much.

Everton: Local rivals. They're bitter because we are and always have been more successful than them, and they don't like living in our shadow. This rivalry divides families and friendships every time the derby comes arond (it just so happens to be this weekend) but it seems to be only for the game, and once the dust settles after every time we play, there's no hard feelings between players or fans (at least as far as know, I don't live in the city, sadly)

Chelsea: Only successful because some eastern European billionaire cunt came in and bought them their success and hired the biggest twat in football to manage them. We always seem to meet in big games at big times, such as cup semi finals, etc. more of a recent rivalry that developed over the past 15 years or so. 

Manchester City and Arsenal: not a bitter rivalry in my eyes, the only reason why they're on this list is because they're teams that we have to challenge for top spots and compete with them for trophies etc., but I don't exactly have anything against them, unless we're playing them, of course. Then they're cunts, but that applies to every team.

Why I'm a fan: I was born into it. My family have supported the club for generations. It's in my blood. Don't really know what else to say past that.

Glad to have you as a fan of the club. Welcome aboard! :)",0,1411592414,null,0,false,0,ckrksr3,t3_2hd5gk,t1_ckrksr3,t3_2hd5gk,null,1426840192,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Soldado looked anonymous at times but that could be down to the lack of drive behind him. He seems to head to the channels too often, and then stays there. So we have one striker contributing in the wrong positions, and another failing to contribute in the right positions (Ade). However the man got ***his*** goal, not just any goal, but the kind of goal you expect from Soldado. An instinctual snapshot, which will help him back on track more than usual (I hope)

Kane had a better showing that his last run out.

The Vertonghen &amp; Fazio partnership needs work, and Poch did well on that one.. He gave them what should be an easier game to start laying down foundations. There is potential there, and this is by no means a reflection on their quality, but they should not start together at Cuntenal on the weekend. Simply due to needing time to gel more than anything else.

Townsend is becoming Lennon MkII. He continually gets himself into dangerous positions and then picks the wrong option. He crossed when he had almost no support, and shot several times when the box was packed. It annoys me that he is still trying the longshots when they are paying off so little. If they are crowding the box and limiting chances by all means shoot from range, even if the spacestation is at risk of damage at least it forces players out to close you down creating space. Wailing the stadium from 30 yards with several players making runs infront of you is selfish. That said he still ran hard.

Mason came on and changed the game. I don't think it was down to anything other that a youth player coming on and playing with confidence. Hell even if he wasn't confident he scored a great goal, gave everyone else confidence and they immediately turned up the heat.

Also did anyone else notice that as soon as we scored, the confidence crept in, the fans turned up the volume. We started playing the pressing game. Lennon and Townsend started hunting players down and taking the ball? Amazing what some confidence can do.

A bit disappointed with Fazio today.  Made several mistakes (one of which nearly cost us a goal) and his passing was awful.  His forward passes were nearly always intercepted, and even his sideways passes to Vertonghen often required Jan to track back several yards to collect them.

This game also confirmed that commentators cannot bring themselves to praise Lamela ever.  His pass to Kane was sublime, but all the commentators could talk about were Mason's pass to Lamela to set up the play, and Kane's finish. WTF?

The reason for the expenses scandal, which this article is attempting to piggyback on, is that MPs were unofficially allowed to top up what was, by reasonable standards, a low rate of pay for their level of responsibility.

So they topped up, and this led to a scandal. And an independent commission was established, which concluded pay should be substantially increased and expenses substantially cut.

There are four distinct grumbles in this article:
1. MLAs not doing what they're paid for
2. Expenses claims are very high
3. Everyone else is suffering, they should too
4. Nobody needs more than £45k in NI

Each of these points is separate, and shouldn't be lumped together. To address them all:

1. Vote them out. 
2. Travelling is expensive, they do a lot of it. Running a country costs a lot.
3. Recession is over, more people are now in work. Also, this is just mean-spirited schoolboy thinking, wanting to see others suffering.
4. Bollocks. £45k is comfortable middle class, but hardly gold-plated Bentley territory. Are you trying to start a class war?

At the bottom of the Profile Editor window there's an option titled ""JVM Arguments"" which basically means ""Are there any specific things you want to tell Java Virtual Machine to do while booting?""

Tick that box

There's two things you want to edit: Xms and Xmx values. Xms is the minimum amount of RAM you want Minecraft to draw from and Xmx is the maximum amount. As a general rule you want these to be the same value otherwise there can be big pauses in gameplay due basically to how inefficient Java is on such large scales.

Want to allocate 2GB of RAM? ""-Xms2G -Xmx2G""

4GB? ""-Xms4G -Xmx4G""

Edit: if you've done it right Minecraft should boot just fine and when you click F3 the top right should look like this:

To my delight, that season took a very epic turn a couple of months later as LFC played in the Champions league against Olympiakos and Steven Gerrard scored one of the best goals ever. the rest as they say is history. Watch the story of istanbul for reference!!  
  
To really support LFC means being knowlegeble about the club and the game. Take that to heart, learn all that you can, the history is rich and the ride of supporting them is bumpy as fuck. But that kind of commitment means the greatest of joys when things are going well.

* Healthy/Not on the list - they're expected to play
* Probable - likely to play, but it's possible they will not
* Questionable - 50/50. Likely a game-time decision
* Doubtful - not likely to play, but it's possible they could see limited appearance
* Out - not fit to play, although still on the active roster for future games
* Injured Reserve (IR) - this player is injured and now deemed ineligible to return for the season. His roster position is now able to be filled by another player not yet on the 53-man roster.

There are also two other injury list types: Physically Unable to Perform (PUP), which is for football-related injuries prior to/during training camp, and Non-Football Injury (NFI), which is obviously for what it states.

I did my undergrad at St. Andrews not too long ago so I'll try give a few tips. 

1. Stuff to bring - aside from the hall essentials (bedding etc) you will defiantly want some sort of rain proof jacket. Umbrellas tend to get destroyed in the wind, so jackets are the way to go. Also, swimming costume. You may not think so now, but you are really going to want to swim in the North Sea at the crack of dawn on May 1st. I would also bring something you can wear to a ball, and something you can wear to a costume party - you will probably end up at one or both during your time here.

2. Stuff to do - you will see all there is to see in St. Andrews in one afternoon. There are some very nice pubs, some lovely beach walks, and some historical sights but that's about it! Further afield there is lots to see in Scotland so I would suggest looking in to doing some weekend trips. St. Andrews is not a city - there is really only one ""club"" so nightlife is pretty dead which brings me to...

3. Make friends! - the real nightlife in St. Andrews is based around house parties and society events. Coming in spring semester means you will really have to make an effort to meet people - go to the societies fayre, join a sport, join a club, talk to people in your hall. St. Andrews is a great place, but what makes it so great are the people, so get out there and meet people!

From my personal experience, many electronics are still substantially cheaper. *Check the power capacity*, there are many things that will be fine in the UK. 

Digital Cameras, for example, where you can buy a separate charger. I didn't even need to buy a charger, just an adapter, for my canon dslr charger, and my batteries charge fine. Obviously lenses and things don't need plugging in at all. My really fucking expensive camera was half price over there at RRP.

 I've actually had laptops that had no problems coming here (2 dell inspirons from a few years ago), and I just used a cheap travel adapter on them (also, you can buy different power cords for your model). The sticker underneath mine said they go up to 220. Phones are a bit more iffy. Tablets, also iffy. I'm not sure I would trust those offhand, but I'm sure the box would say. With some things you just need to buy a separate UK battery charger. 

If you're within 30 non-traffic miles of an In-N-Out Burger, it's worth the drive. Also if you're in SoCal, have a god damn burrito.

The general trend is if something costs a dollar over there, it's a pound over here. So the pound shops are dollar stores, a £5 fast food meal is $5, etc... Enjoy the currency conversion and the high fructose corn syrup :-)

He is a decent young winger that has a bit of promise. But in Europe thats about a dime a dozen. There are dozens upon dozens of talented young wingers in Europe and I don't think Salah is one of the best in that category let alone Chelsea starting quality.

The only reason we got him was because De Bruyne (and Mata) left in the winter and we were bare thin in attacking midfield. We were not even linked with him until the De Bruyne sale FFS! It was an emergency replacement. In the next two years I expect him to be sold or have his spot taking over by Thorgan Hazard, Traore or Piazon.

Also, Mourinho's comments about him being an important player and having a breakthrough season this year also contributed into making this sub think he is something more than he is. If you actually paid attention to how good he was for Basel instead of just jumping onto the Mourinho comment band wagon you could see that he would literally have to transform completely as a player for him to get to the level needed to get anywhere near playing week in week out for Chelsea.

Shürrle needs to work on his passing. Yes his strengths are supposed to be his movement and finishing, but he needs to at least look for simple passes like finding Luis on the overlap.

Yes Andre won't be starting on the left wing in any serious game barring injury to Hazard, but still.

Building off that, Luis looked good, managed to get in several well placed crosses when he was found. Hoping to see more of him soon, specifically with Azpi on the right.

Ake looked so composed in the center, really have high hopes for him. He can play what, three positions? CM/LB/CB, in that order most likely? Would love to see him break into the first team soon.

What do I suggest we do?  Encourage the countries of the middle east to collectively deal with the problem themselves.  The people of ISIS/IS/ISIL *want* us to attack them, so that they can paint it as a ""Christian West attack Muslims again"" story, and thus encourage more people to join them.  We shouldn't play their game.  We need to see the governments of Iraq, Jordan, Syria, UAE, Kuwait, etc. deal with the problem that is on their borders.

If you're swapping out a striker for another midfielder you can't just play the same midfielders. We've often ended up with 1 striker, 1 effective winger/midfielder (Sterling) and then 3 or 4 others who don't directly contribute much in goals or chances created (Lucas, Henderson, Gerrard, Rossiter last night, Markovic).
That's not too big a deal for the League Cup but we've had a similar problem in the league as well.

If we've one up top I think we need 4 of Coutinho, Suso, Lallana, Markovic (although he doesn't quite look ready to influence games yet), Sterling and possibly Can between the deepest midfielder and the striker.

If we want to be really aggressive and take the game to them (and try to play the same style as last season) I think 1 relatively defensive midfielder is enough - Hendo, Allen or, in a pinch, Lucas.
You could swap another one of them in for one of the attacking midfielders against better teams.

I think playing Gerrard in there is trying to foist a defensive line-up into an attacking system and you end up unable to defend or attack very well. I don't think Stevie can play with only 1 up front.

Generally with my bike, once the wear starts to look like that with the flat edges instead of the round profile, I start to get the wobble. 

On the back wheel you'll have some markings on the swingarm that will look like notches: http://www.moorespeedracing.co.uk/user/products/large/CR0019BK.jpg -there will be a mark on the chain adjuster that corresponds to these notches. Undo the axle bolt, adjust the adjuster on the chain side until you have the right amount of tension (allowing an amount of slack too) then look at the axle notches and count how many notches until you reach the  one the adjuster is on. Then match the adjuster on the opposite side to the number of notches on the chain side exactly - accounting for half notches. The closer you are, the better your alignment will be. Then just do up your adjusters and the axle bolt and you're good to go!

But she's really worried that if she finds it too much and it triggers a mental relapse, they might not let her go back to the 15 hours + benefits.  So she's scared to try to increase her hours.  Any advice?

I think this excuse is used way too much. I think a lot of the finger pointing needs to be at Rogers. I am a massive fan of his and hope to hell he has a long career at the club. But his decision making and selections have been....odd. It's clear as shit we suit the diamond with 2 strikers and yet he has been starting with one striker. Once the 60th minute clocks around a 2nd striker comes on and we actually look decent.

It was also clear as day that a lot of our defensive problems steamed from the DM position and the fact Gerrard just doesn't have the engine to make an impact there anymore and yet we appear to have completely ignored the need for a quality player in that role and it's now SERIOUSLY biting us in the arse.

Re defense, it's actually gone backwards at a great rate of knots since he took over, year on year it's gotten worse. Despite having a backline that Rafa made pretty solid and Kenny did fairly well with, he hasn't improved them. At all. Why have we not considered a speciliast coach?

I suspect that these quotes, along with the others not so long ago, are part of an attempt to carefully set the narrative in public. He says all the right things: ""great fans"", ""wants to stay"" at a ""great club"", but ""needs playing time"".

If he does leave the club in the lurch and doesn't sign a new contract he's already set the narrative of why, and I think it's quite cynical IMO, because it's an attempt to leave with the goodwill of the fans, while effectively screwing the club.

Sadly, I think a lot of people will take it on face value. But Milner has previous for this at Newcastle.

As I said, the club clearly want him to sign, and I'm certain there could be a reasonable buyout clause added to a new contract to enable Milner to leave in the summer should he wish.

But that all comes down to where his loyalties lie.

I suspect he has his eye on a good farewell season, leaving on a free and receiving a major signing on fee at a new club.

false,thebathinape,null,null,"India wouldn't exist as it does now, it would have been much better off. To assume that industrialization would have never happened India is simply false. Even that article provides an example of how Britain de-industrialized India for its own benefit.

&gt;At the beginning of the 18th century India's share of the world economy was 23%, as large as all of Europe put together. By the time we won independence, it had dropped to less than 4%. The reason was simple: India was governed for the benefit of Britain. Britain's rise for 200 years was financed by its depredations in India.

&gt;The construction of the Indian Railways is often pointed to as benefit of British rule, ignoring the obvious fact that many countries have built railways without having to be colonized to do so. Nor were the railways laid to serve the Indian public. They were intended to help the British get around, and above all to carry Indian raw materials to the ports to be shipped to Britain. The movement of people was incidental except when it served colonial interests; no effort was made to ensure that supply matched demand for mass transport.

Free enterprise did not happen to India under the British. Universities? I know you can't be that delusional. It is easy to criticize the journey because there is so much wrong with the journey.

To think that colonialism had a positive impact on modern India is ludicrous on so many levels, I don't even know where to begin. At this point in history it isn't even subjective that colonialism is hugely negative. There have been numerous historians and economists (including British) that have outlined the evil of colonialism.

A world where Africa is the only continent that was affected negatively by colonialism, when there was near genocide of Native American's throughout the America's.

You're parallel example of the Great Wall doesn't even apply, The Great Wall was to protect against the invaders. The British were invaders, The British Raj was built on the exploitation of millions of Indians. How do these to examples even compare?

You make a bunch of assumptions about how industrialization wouldn't have occurred in India, when there is no evidence to suggest that. You point to Universities like the British have a monopoly on education, like all the universities built around the world are due to colonial force of greater good. Free enterprise didn't exist in India under the British. All you are doing is dismissing facts that are laid out in front of you by calling it revisionist history.
