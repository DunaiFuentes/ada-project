Enough that in 1776, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor was founded, eventually establishing a colony for the so called ""black poor"" in Sierra Leone. What's interesting is that in addition to the black passengers, 70 white women also travelled to Sierra Leone, which suggests there was some level of racial integration and inter-marriage. 

Jewish people have also been immigrating to London for centuries. 

And although we don't think of the Irish as ""vastly incompatible"" nowadays, this was certainly not the case for a very long time. The Irish were discriminated against in Britain until surprisingly late into the last century. Ever seen one of those ""no blacks, no dogs, no Irish"" signs from the '60s?

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Networked advantage - basically the kids have backgrounds that enable opportunities and then take advantage of the situation they are in. Especially if their parents can move to catchment areas that help. So when the kids arrive at the school application process - they already have a better fit as well as an advantage in achievement.

The schools themselves them pick in their own image - which is the same background that the kids come from. This isn't just grammar schools, it's pretty much the way the whole education system is skewed - due to the dominance of similar social classes. 

Now people thought meritocracy of selection would solve this, but it only seems to do this for one generation because what happens is that one generation gets a boost, then ends up in the same social group that was self -selecting in the first place and thus replicates network advantage.

So little Jonny may have been from a poor background, but when he goes through the process he end up in the same class as the people around him, and then goes on to marry or have kids with the newer class and then little Janey ends up with the same advantages. 

The solutions are quite problematic but the Finish one is to equalise education provision and focus on the child's individual outcomes, with less testing reduced and low class sizes.

Otherwise we're almost into 'difficulty level; Asian' being offensive simply because you've made a reference to someone's location of origin.

Sure, others may use it as a racist term, but I can't speak for them, and likewise would take offense at their dictating the definition to me; If someone  says ""fuckin' Irish"" because (for whatever reason) they don't like the Irish, does that mean the word 'Irish' is now offensive?

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"Related: I went to a school that was a grammar school in name but was in fact an independent school. I was the highest scoring candidate that year but I was from a poor family so would not have been able to afford the fees. Fortunately I was able to get in on the assisted place scheme.  2 years later Tony Blair's New Labour government cancelled the scheme on the basis that it was ""elitist"". That meant that my brother, who had aspirations of studying medicine at Cambridge, had to go to a state comprehensive.

It's not correct to blame grammar schools for social inequality. Children who are more able will obviously benefit from an environment where they can be taught in a way that suits their abilities, rather than being held back by their less able peers. Claiming this gives them an unfair advantage is absurd. They were *born* with an unfair advantage; would you take this away from them? Would you deny them the opportunity to realise their full potential?

The real culprits lie elsewhere. For starters I would point to universities selecting based on which school you went to instead of academic performance. Earlier I mentioned my brother: if he had gone to my school and achieved the exact same A level results as he did at the local comprehensive, I have no doubt he would have got into Cambridge.

I would also point my finger at boneheaded moves by government. The assisted place scheme allowed able children from poor families to have an education that would otherwise be only available to the wealthy. The fact that a Labour government of all things would abolish such a scheme is frankly a betrayal.

The problem of social inequality is complex and nuanced and I don't claim that the issues I have pointed out here are the only, or even the major, ones. However I must repeat my objection to the article's insinuation that children should not have options other than the local comprehensive.

Plenty of things, thanks for asking. I think their religion is stupid, but I suppose stupid personal religious beliefs should be tolerated. If people want to pray X times a day or whatever, that's up to them I guess. Mainly I dislike their culture. Their treatment of women. Their views on homosexuality. Their attitudes towards marriage. Their ways of raising their children. All of which stem from religion. And I dislike that some of these things are becoming more widespread in the UK. None of those things particularly fit with how I would like the UK to be in the future, thus I have a problem with it. And it's not racist to say that. 

And yes, I'd have equal problem if it was French people, or even Brits, who were doing those things. And their skin colour doesn't matter.

I speculate it comes up so often because certain things, like financing and inheritance, are problematic for individuals to have implemented without the support of the state.

I think if there was more awareness, the general public wouldn't get so anxious when they hear of how people decide different things for themselves.

I moved to the Wirral when I was to start secondary school (where they still have a mixture of grammar schools and high schools). I didn't take the 11 plus and went to the local High School. It was appalling, the other students in the High School felt like they had been given a death sentence. After 3 months of poor education (mainly because of disruptive and aggressive students) and severe bullying I took the 12 plus, passed and was allowed to go to the Grammar School. The teaching at the Grammar was no better, if not worse than the High School: the only difference was that the students had a higher average intelligence.

Segregation of the students allowed poor teaching to be covered up by intelligent students. Segregation made the high school students feel like 2nd class pieces of shit. Segregation put disruptive students all in one school. Segregation made intelligent student, albeit in the bottom sets in the Grammar school, give up as they felt they weren't good enough. Segregation created ""us"" and ""them"" attidudes. Segregation is a bad idea.


Finally, I would ask a statistician to look at the life expectancy of students in grammar schools and high schools in the same area. You will find a difference (based on anecdotal evidence I gathered :P).

I have a similar story and now feel proud to have made my ""contribution to society"" through a feature request which was released in yesterday's Android iPlayer update.

A month ago I noticed that subtitles don't play on dowloaded programmes. Having sleuthed around, I found the location of the downloaded programmes and noticed the subtitle files *are* downloaded but they aren't playable.

Like any sane person, I wrote a politely worded request asking whether it's possible to enable subtitle playback for downloaded programmes just like you can with streamed media.

I never received a reply from them. Having said that, if you check the ""What's new"" description on the Play Store:

&gt;Subtitles are now also available for downloaded programmes.

As for bursting my bubble, I am aware that the availability of subtitles could be entirely unrelated and merely coincidental to me contacting them. For all I know, this could have been a feature in development for months or it could have been something that only happened as a result of me contacting them. 

I guess I'll never know...

Grammar schools in and of themselves, are not bad. They're actually a good thing. They have higher standards, better teachers, more resources - this is good.

The problem is, in a world of limited resources and infinite demand, what we're doing is creating 'ladders' for the best-of-the-worst-off to escape limited opportunities in life - rather than genuinely increasing opportunities for all, especially those with few opportunities.

It can then be used to justify poor conditions in a hunger-games esque style. ""If you didn't want to live in poverty and at risk of homelessness your whole life, you should have done better at school."" Someone's life chances become determined by selection tests at age 11.

The argument against them is thus: the limited resources we have would be better spent on better comprehensives rather than more grammar schools. But that's a very old-labour kind of view; that there's nothing wrong with being a 'worker' rather than aspirational middle-class house-owner with their own business and a healthy retirement nest-egg. In today's world there's very little sympathy for anyone who struggles to get by because they *could have* gone and got a university education if they were smart enough.

It's the bullshit idea of equality, that we are all somehow equal in skills, we are not remotely.  Some are amazing natural athletes, some mathematicians, others poets, some just an amazing affinity with mechanics.  Some people have great looks, others, less so.

At that age I was being told how well I was doing, my research was considered very good for someone of my age, very *academic*.  Flash back to school and I was being kicked out at 13 for not focusing on the *academic* subjects.

The idea that we have to sausage factory people is absurd, everyone must learn the same.  Is it remotely helpful knowing how the human intestine works at all for a lot of people?  I mean many of them didn't begin to understand it, just look at the grades they obtained.  We've got this stupid idea that we have to pretend.  Same goes with maths, some people understand basic calculus by the time they become a teenager.  If you can visualise the relationship between say velocity and acceleration it's *kinda sorta obvious*, sure they probably wouldn't write the principia mathematica, but they'd be happy drawing rectangles under a curve and working out the area.  Others at this age still can't grasp the idea of mean average.  (Side note, I believe most news sources hire exclusively only the latter).

Personally I think allowing much better flexibility, maybe like the German system would be fairer.  Equality of opportunities.  Instead we've got this everyone gets a medal at sports day mentality.  No one can be allowed to feel that they are bad at something (unless they are dyslexic, in which case the fucking retard should be able to spell, as one of my teachers put it.)",0,1401362854,null,0,false,0,chtwivg,t3_26rvfn,t1_chtwivg,t1_chtw889,null,1434003013,39,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,39

While a stock-market investment certainly involves risk, and you certainly can gamble on the stock market, I don't think it's fair to call a diversified long-term investment with an back-simulated positive expected return (in the vast majority of cases) ""gambling"" - practically every decision you make in life entails *some* risk. Even keeping cash in the back entails risk (unless it's the cash you really care about, and not the stuff it can buy).

I have money in a stocks and bonds fund-of-funds, and I always ""mind"" losing money but I'm happy with the risk profile and the likelihood of short term losses (at some point) on the way to long term returns.

I'm not giving financial advice, but I think the important thing is for an investor to understand what they're investing in, and the risks and charges associated with it. For example, a 100% equity portfolio is probably riskier than most people would really want.

when investing in the FTSE100, the odds of either of those scenarios happening (doubling or losing) is very small.  you won't double your money in an instant, but equally, no one expects you to lose your whole stake.  

the point is that there is a wide range of risk levels that people can take with their money, which goes from money in a bank /  government bonds, through FTSE100 type investments, internet start up companies, and ends with the roulette table.  you are right to say that you are gambling with your money in so far as you have the risk of some loss, but you could equally say that government debt investors are gambling on the continued solvency of the UK government.  it is misleading to people to paint investments like this with the same brush (though equally it is wrong to try and underplay the risks).",0,1401363430,null,0,false,0,chtwna6,t3_26qjjf,t1_chtwna6,t1_chtvmyu,null,1434003071,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

Another reason was 'extreme' views made things awkward, such as casual homophobic remarks, sexism and creationism (to put that in context imagine a non-muslim say they hate gays, and would you want to be friends with them?).

It was more a system for keeping the kids off the streets than it was for giving them any real chances in life. And why should the kids care, they've probably spent the majority of their time in education not measuring up and not being given the support at school or home to do better, then they're labeled at 12 years old as not the kids not really worth bothering with.

When I was 14 my parents ended up moving and I finished my education at a standard comp. Where I found a much more balanced system, I also found out I was dyslexic &amp; was given help with that, and ended up with 11 pretty good GCSEs. Most of my friends back at my old Secondary Modern barely scraped through their exams, many didn't even bother. Only a small number of them went on to higher education, a fairly large number of them ended up with fairly extensive criminal records.

If Scotland left the Barnett formula gets slightly less broken because you no longer have this odd exception which gives extra money to a pretty decently well off part of the country.

I think nationalism will increase if Scotland left. That will actually make Wales further better off monetarily. Westminster tends to fund areas that want to leave its rule very heavily. Which is of course why the Barnett formula is as perverse as it is.

I'd take care drawing too many parallels between Scotland and Wales though. The situations are very different. The SNP took the monarchy issue off the table to help its case.

It helps no-one if a family of staunch BNP supporters move into the house of a black person who has recently immigrated.  It helps no-one if an Indian family proposed to move into this fellow's house who only wants people from Pakistan.  The sign signals the belief.  If the sign wasn't there the belief still would be, even if it would be nice if it was not.

In all likelihood, this fellow will put a sign up that says nothing about race, and turn down people who want to live in his house until he finds a family from Pakistan.  Because changing what he does with the sign doesn't change what he's looking to avoid (whatever that is).  So whatever we do with the sign, it's likely we are only pushing the racism into subtler realms.  I don't see how it is right to force this fellow to let his place to a family of orthodox Jews, or people from Africa or whatever.  I don't see who that would serve - he would be unhappy because he hasn't got a Pakistani family, and the people who moved in wouldn't be happy because their Landlord doesn't seem to like them.

Obviously it is a shame that this guy is not more tolerant - but where do we cut things off - perhaps he specifically wanted Pakistani people because he thinks they'll get bulk discounts on flights to Lahore or something.

I mean, Soldado having a bad first season does not disprove his record over the last few years, and if it was only 13 mill up front with add-ones, that seems like a solid bit of transfer protection from him being a flop.

Vlad has been solid and is likely to fetch a profit if we wish to sell him.

For how much was spent on him and that he is still young, Chadli seems a solid investment for 6 mill

Paulinho hasn't been great, but we are still likely to at least recoup money spent if we choose to sell him, nonetheless he is still a solid premier league midfielder that Champions League clubs are after.

The only real 'bad' transfers he did we Capoue and Lamela. For the latter, it took far longer with crap performances for Bale to turn world class, so I am willing to give Baldini the benefit of the doubt until he has a season without injuries.

That leaves Capoue, who hasn't been great, but hasn't exactly been a disaster. He holds resale value and can fit in when needed, and his failure has mostly been down to Sherwood not liking him and preferring Benteleb.

Have you actually got a source on that or is it just completely anecdotal?  Selection to a grammar school is on academic merit, that's pretty much the point of them.  Obviously social factors come into play - middle class kids are perhaps more likely to meet the standard because they're prepped for it.  But that doesn't mean that working class kids are necessarily excluded.  And the ones that get in will find themselves upwardly mobile.  

&gt;and hardly any of them came from the local area.

Well yeah.  Local comps ""selection"" process is the catchment area.  Whether the kids are local or not doesn't have much bearing on the social mobility of the kids at the school.

""dress code normal British people wear"" - not even sure what this means, though apart from London we again have a pretty poor reputation for style &amp; fashion. We mostly just wear US designed/invented stuff.

""women on an equal footing as men"" - not true, and never has been.

""not being a foreigner in my own country"" - you're not. In any way whatsoever. Now me, from as British background as anyone but born in Africa, I am a foreigner in my own country.

Soldado - 26 million for La Liga's 3rd best scorer. Btw, the top two are Messi and Ronaldo. No way anyone could've known he'd have the season he did.

Lamela - 30 mil for an extremely talented 21 year old ""wunderkid."" People who talk shit about this move are extra stupid. Nobody could've known he'd be injured all year, and he's still only 22 years old. We didn't buy him for one season.

Paulinho - 17 mil for one of Brazil's best players at the Confederations Cup, a tournament that they simply ran through. There is absolutely no way that anyone could've known he'd have such a poor year.

Chadli - What, 8 mil? That sounds about the right price for a ""top 4 competing"" rotation player, nowadays.

Capoue - Was he 8, too? Same reasoning.

Sevilla received the bid – which would also allow them to take Suso, the midfield player, on a season long loan – yesterday and are now considering whether or not it is substantial enough to allow the highly-rated defender to join Liverpool.
  
Along with Liverpool’s transfer committee, Rodgers has been considering a number of options to fill the left-back slot with Chelsea’s Ryan Bertrand, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, and Filipe Luís of Atletico Madrid among those who have been scouted.
  
It is Moreno, though, who has emerged as their preferred option and Liverpool will hope that the offer they have made, which represents a club-record bid for a left back, will tempt Sevilla to do business.
  
Liverpool also remain keen to conclude a deal for Adam Lallana, although they are yet to agree a fee with Southampton for the England midfielder. That move is complicated by an agreement which entitles Bournemouth to 25 per cent of the proceeds of the sale of their former player.
  
Liverpool are unwilling to pay more than £20 million for Lallana but Southampton want to clear that amount after they have given Bournemouth their share.

Which is why I am now inspired by Reddit to propose a new voting system. You may cast one only vote, but it can be either a downvote or an upvote. So if you're not sure who you want to win, and wish to leave that to a better informed set of voters (the optimum strategy for uninformed voters according to game theory), you can still vote against someone you absolutely don't want to win.

Under that system I reckon UKIPs vote would have plummeted.

Also, many more people would have voted since their vote would have more meaning and less risk from lack of knowledge.",0,1401366743,null,0,false,0,chtxfnn,t3_26qeee,t1_chtxfnn,t1_chtvq1y,null,1434003416,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

&gt;It is the official Government measure used to define poverty, with those on 60 per cent or more less than the median income deemed to be in that category. 

It's really hard to get proper figures on these projections.  ONS data projects a growth in population of about 1M children in that age range.  [Interestingly barnardos have the number at just 1M](http://www.barnardos.org.uk/what_we_do/our_projects/child_poverty/child_poverty_what_is_poverty/child_poverty_statistics_facts.htm), rather than 1.5M here.  Again, no one is showing their workings

What I think they are really saying is that the median income will have shifted, thus putting a higher proportion of the population into child poverty.

The problem with this is median is grossly disproportionate to those living in London compared to well almost anywhere else.  Without seeing the workings I worry that they haven't geo-seperated this properly.

This is bad for two reasons, one, that 5 million number is bullshit, which lets be honest, if your idea of poverty is almost half the population, then yeah, it probably is.

If I wanted to make a streaming video service, I be having to pay quite a lot for the transit.  If some ISP then wanted to charge me more for a better link to them, then that isn't much different to the fact I pay more for a route to netherlands than I do for a domestic one as is.

The issue for the US, is that it is effectively being done to squeeze newcomers to cable companies profits.  I'd argue it's more anti-competitive because of that.  We don't today have a neutral net, I couldn't compete against iPlayer without massive investment by the major ISPs, whom I would either have to insentivise by giving money, or by saying they will loose users.

What we don't want is having one company, lets for fictions sake say it's owned by a nasty criminal from dingoland, muscling out any other content delivery than their satellite service, we shall call them Space for this fictions sake.  Space in this context could launch a new brand, called When Demand, now Space would ensure that all their many customers would get great access to When Demand, obviously BBC are so strong, they would also get good access to iPlayer, but my little video service, not so much.  Luckily in that fiction Space were a bit late to the party and ultimately Netflix and Amazon have too much of a beachhead.  I would put the earnest on those companies educating their users to understand how the consumers choice in ISP can effect things.

However, if we didn't have an option, if say a fictitious firm called BT Reacharound who had a state backed monopoly on most physical lines started prioritising the When Demand service from Space, well, then we'd have a bit of a pickle that would greatly worry me.

The issue I think though is some people attempt to turn the UK into their previous home instead of adapting to the UK, while I have no problem with people not wanting to participate in the community its when you give it a big middle finger in the process.

Let's be clear though while people tend to have different opinions that can range to extreme opposites, when the core values of that particular country are not shared by those who immigrate there or are at least not respected then you can have major issues arising from that kind of immigration.

&gt;WALES is not there anymore.


&gt;After a brutal night of hefty winds, Britain woke up to discover that its western chunk had been sheered off and was now tossing in the north Atlantic, 150 miles off the coast of Iceland.

&gt;People in Herefordshire were first to realise the principality had been removed when they awoke to find themselves living on the coast.

&gt;Martin Bishop, from the village of Clifford, said: “At first I thought my house had been picked up and dumped next to the sea, like some sort of ‘Wizard of Oz’ fantasy that I’m always having.

&gt;“I said to my dog, ‘we’re not in Herefordshire anymore, Toto’, but then I realised that Wales wasn’t there.

&gt;“At last.”

&gt;Bishop’s neighbour, Margaret Gerving, said: “It seems very traumatic at the moment, but it’s for the best.”

&gt;Jane Thompson, from Shrewsbury, added: “The A458 is now a road to nowhere. Sorry, the A458 is still a road to nowhere.”

&gt;Meanwhile, the government said it was studying a range of options on what to do about Wales and would announce a decision sometime next year.

On the other hand, if parents don't buy books of exercises for their children to work through, does this imply some level of blame on the parents?

He is making an assumption based on the colour of somebodies skin and of their ethnic origin. Obviously there is some context missing which he may be aware of; Are her parents religious for starters? How long/how many generations have their family resided in the UK? They may have moved to the UK to get away from those outdated traditions, we just don't know here. 

As you say, it's an observation on a cultural difference between the UK and India (You are 100% correct here), that part is not the problem. The problem is assuming that Matt's Girlfriend and her family are Indian and hold Indian values. When does one stop becoming Indian and start becoming British? What will it take to convince people that they are British and hold British values? In the eyes of a large proportion of the British public, people like this will never be seen as British unless people get to know them, and this won't happen because people treat them like outsiders and disassociate themselves with them. For instance if some immigrants moved in next door, a good portion of people wouldn't even invite them in for a cup of tea, where they would for a white British family.

One main thing is economic growth comes from efficiency improvements.  I can produce a copy of the Gutenberg Bible, it's 1200~ pages in, well according the sales claim anyway, in 20 min, all the while I'll be browsing reddit, I mean being efficent.

Growth can be a refinement.  On the context of environmental ones, lets look at certain kinds of crops, that have been *ahem* selectively refined.  These take less effort to make, the same amount of space yields more food.

If we didn't have nitrates, we'd be starving, or rather we'd probably have never grown our population in the 18/19th century.  Let alone freeing up time for people to work on other things.

Monbiot strikes me as the kind of person that doesn't understand how any of these things happen, or possibly could happen, so desires to go back to a small agrarian culture.

As you say we solved the horse dung issue, a terrible health hazard, a spreader of sickness and just discomfort.  Sure we replaced that with a bit of lead, but we replaced that with just a few nasty gases.  We're probably going to do the same again.

The issue is that environmentally unfriendly fuels have such easy access to tremendous captured energy.  Capturing energy efficiently is one of the hardest problems we face, but we're getting better, and we're getting better at using it.  Whilst I see say a Tesla as an example of a steam car, replacing the horse, rather than a motor car, we have some solutions.

We could quite easily flick over to nuclear fission, we've the technology, it wouldn't even be that expensive long term, all those NIMBY types are more and more likely to change their minds as the price of our generation goes up and up.  Are we fucking up the planet and our health, yup, hell I'm going out drinking tonight, sorry liver.  But does that mean the end of all things, not really.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","And that's part of the problem. We can't have a proper discussion about the pros and cons of the culture brought to the UK by Muslim immigrants because of this demand that we be ""respectful of Islam""; we only got a decent discussion about the pros and cons of Christian culture in the UK when it was permissible to disrespect Christianity.

Some of the bits of culture that are worth discussing aren't even Islamic, for that matter - they're Pashtun, Punjabi, Mehri, Bedouin etc; however, many Muslims and non-Muslims alike confuse this with Islam and require you to respect not just Islam itself, but also the cultures of regions that are predominantly Muslim.

To some extent, the demand that you ""respect XXX or things get nasty quickly"" is a way to shut down discussion; as a thought experiment, it can be worthwhile to consider things like ""what happens if we assume that people don't go to church on a Sunday? what happens if people are prevented from saying all five daily prayers? is it reasonable to expect you to make up time lost to your religious practices?"". You don't seriously expect Christians to stop going to church, or Muslims to stop with their prayers, but it's worth putting it up for discussion so that it can be dealt with in reasoned fashion, as Muslim scholars of the 14th to 17th centuries CE demonstrated.

I know I know, but it really bothers me that we just fall under the juridiction of the 'British' parliament when it is in effect for the most part only an English parliament. 

I've no problem with the devolution acts back in the early 2000's but when England was left out it really agitated me, I don't mean that regional BS Prescott tried to put in place, England's a small country and having more than one form of governance for it is a really silly idea.

When the Scottish and Welsh devolution got the go ahead it gave them both revived identities and through time their allegiance to the UK has withered as a result while the English were stuck with the British identity.   

I think each of the 4 home nations should have it's own domestic rule (devolved parliaments) while the British Government precides over the Army and represents us on the international stage. 

I'd vote for the English Democrats if they'd change their policy on the EU.

I don't think an English parliament is a radical idea, I think most people in England would actually support it, at least here in York anyway.

&gt;

&gt;___Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency___ is a humorous [detective novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_novel) by [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams), first published in 1987. It is described by the author on its cover as a ""thumping good detective-ghost-horror-who dunnit-time travel-romantic-musical-comedy-epic"".

&gt;The book was followed by a sequel, *[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Dark_Tea-Time_of_the_Soul)*. The only recurring major characters are the eponymous [Gently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently), his secretary Janice Pearce and Sergeant Gilks. Adams also began work on another novel, *[The Salmon of Doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salmon_of_Doubt)* with the intention of publishing it as the third book in the series, but died before completing it.

&gt;A [BBC Radio adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently%27s_Holistic_Detective_Agency#BBC_Radio_adaptation) starring [Harry Enfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Enfield) was broadcast on [BBC Radio 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4) in October 2007. A [second series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Dark_Tea-Time_of_the_Soul_(radio_serial\)) based on the sequel was broadcast on October 2008. A [2010 television adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently_(TV_series\)) by [Howard Overman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Overman) for [BBC Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Four) borrowed some of the characters and some minor plot elements of the novel to create a new story.

The results, in this light, seem pretty clear. The two metrics used, speaking time and the Bechdel test, indicate that there has been an increase in sexism since Moffat took over as show runner.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN DOCTOR WHO IS A SEXIST SHOW

People are going to jump to that conclusion because of the title of this post and because they don't actually read everything in the article. The only thing that is shown here are the following:

* Companions during Moffat's run have less speaking time than during RTD's run
* Companions during Moffat's run fail the Bechdel test more often than during RTD's run
* The previous two statements are also true for all female characters
* There are less female characters with speaking roles in Moffat's run than RTD
* River Song is very bad at passing the Bechdel test

You can draw whatever conclusions you want from that information. Personally it seems like a strong argument that Moffat's stories feature less women who can exist independently of the Doctor.

2) Again, bring all schools up. You're arguing that people shouldn't be allowed to use their wealth to try and get the best education for their children - either through private or moving to the catchment area of a good school. State schools wouldn't magically have a spread of bright kids if you close down private, they'll move to good catchment areas. Professionals are likely to have more involvment with both the school and theit child's education which means over time you'd still have disparity. This point of yours is suggesting throwing a generation of children who would benefit from private into worse state schools in the hope that it'll improve the school. I think that's highly unlikely.

3) The public aren't willing to spend that much on education. Taxes that high do not win votes. Private schools are funded by parents paying the fees on top of their taxes. Raise taxes to increase funding for education and less people will go to private and the state schools will have more funding. Closing private schools before raising taxes to make state schools better is putting the cart before the horse and unnecessary.

Politically, people who argue for independence cite things like the democratic deficit between the will of the Scottish people and Westminster (Tory government right now is the best example) and a shift towards the right (rise of UKIP, etc) that most Scots find rather unpleasant. Scottish voters also see all the good that the devolved parliament has done over the years and may ask themselves; 'why not just go the full mile'?

Economically, those who argue for independence actually believe that given free reign, Scotland could become much more efficient in its handling of tax and spend, with direct control over oil, corporate taxation, etc. The goal would be to aspire to be like Norway, a country of a similar size with very impressive living standards and a strong economy. Proponents of independence argue that Westminster is inefficient and doesn't run the economy in favour of Scotland.

Culturally, Scots usually identify as being 'Scottish' over being 'British' (sorry, don't have the census data to hand so you will have to trust me) and so proponents of independence are more likely to reject British culture as espoused by the mainstream media and the establishment. This is hard to put into words, but it's one of the reasons why David Cameron refuses to debate Salmond, the audience/viewers would give him a really hard time (consciously or subconsciously).

Alright, we've got our definition.

&gt;but in wealthy countries basic human needs can be things like not affording to go to a cinema, which isn't poverty.

Hold on, I thought you said ""deprivation of basic human needs"" is the ""universal meaning of poverty""?  If, in a wealthy country, having the purchasing power available to do some leisure activities, is considered a basic human need, surely not having the money would be considered ""poverty""?

I was really excited about links to him last season but I figured he'd be going to Madrid now. I've watched a bit of him (more last season than this one) so I'll give my (I-Like-To-Act-Like-An-) expert opinion.

**Good:** Very fast, extremely skilful, with the ball, can dribble like Hazard when he gets going. He's ballsy - he's got the right mentality for our team and would gel well with our play-style. I've also been impressed with how he's improved defensively - he's still an attacking full-back, but in the last 18 months he's greatly improved his covering and positioning - I've only watched him a handful of times in the last year, but it's been fairly noticeable. That also points to his attitude and intelligence, Unai Emery is both an incredibly difficult but very rewarding manager to learn from, and the improvements in Moreno's game hint at how much further he can still go. 

**Bad:** Still fairly lightweight, which isn't a problem going forward but i something he'll need to work on defensively, because he's going to get pushed around if he doesn't. He works hard defensively but he's no Felipe Luis. Also, for an attacking full-back who gets forward so well, he doesn't create as many chances directly as you'd expect. He's still a little raw, he can do great work getting the ball up and creating danger but that final ball isn't always there. I don't mean to say he *lacks* end-product, just that he's not yet producing it as consistently as he could. (That's one of the major reasons I prefer RR, he's the same age and he's slightly less electric to watch but his end-product is *exceptional*.) 

Important things to note though: 

*He's 22* and he'll get better. 

We play differently from Sevilla, both in attack and defence. If we can cover defensively for him a bit, I think we'll have a better balance than we do now. And as far as his chance-creation, 1) that's naturally going to be better when he's playing in our team, which is much better in attack and in attacking numbers than Sevilla, 2) Rakitic is the natural creative centre for Sevilla, we don't play with the same creative focal-point and so I think he'll be given more encouragement to play the final ball than he does currently and 3) Suarez, Sturridge, Coutinho, Sterling.... he doesn't *need* to be creating chances all the time. Much like Coutinho's retention and movement of the ball in the opponents' half is often as important as the chances he creates because it allows for everyone to create chances, Moreno's speed, penetration, ball-retention and presence up the pitch improve our attack as a whole. 

He's better than any of the full-backs we have now. ",0,1401372531,null,0,1401384709,0,chtzb0n,t3_26s052,t1_chtzb0n,t1_chtwijf,null,1434004229,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

You're being a little hysterical: having a comprehensive education is not going to condemn you to a life of rack and ruin - especially if your parents are well off and professional.

I would also speculate that when the NHS in the 1970s was advertising abroad for administrative staff in the Commonwealth/ex-colonies they probably targeted Kenya, among other countries, because of the pre-existing, mainly, affluent Indian population there and new arrived refugees who had previously been business minded.

I'm not being hysterical about a comprehensive education, merely stating that dragging children from well performing private schools into state schools that may be underperforming is unfair. Equality of education should be improved by making state schools better.


There are no barriers oreventing state schools from getting involved in the school. Private schools do it well but there's no reason stopping state schools from doing so. How will banning private schools help?

true,coriny,eng-GreaterLondon,London?,"Hmm, I don't entirely agree with the first point.

The issue is one of knowledge. The important distinction is that I don't know if party A is the my least wanted party, I only know that I don't want them. I may be even more opposed to one of the others. Case in point, voting BNP instead of UKIP would not help my pro-EU/pro-science politics (or any of the half-dozen anti-EU parties that were on the voting form)...

There's a game theory argument that if you prefer A, but don't regard yourself sufficiently knowledgeable on the actual differences with B or C, then the maths shows that not voting and relying on more informed voters to choose is of greater benefit to you. Essentially, floating voters are often most benefited by not voting. Can dig out the citation if you want.

In this case you know you don't want A, but it's also possible you may equally not want one of B, C, D but don't have sufficient information to be confident. So you run the risk of misplacing your upvote and causing yourself as much or more ""cost"" as voting for A. Given less information about each candidate that risk becomes greater. In something like the council/eu elections, where even relatively informed people know very little about individual candidates/policies/how the whole shebang works, then that risk is generally pretty high for most people. Thus would seem to tilt the balance towards not voting (specifically upvoting).

Allowing a downvote gives me more incentive to vote since then I can influence the election by improving the chance that the elected party will be picked by knowledgeable non-UKIP voters.

Furthermore, a downvote doesn't necessarily imply that they are the party you least agree with. Tactical downvoting would be the norm: even though I oppose BNP more, I would be more likely to downvote UKIP since I don't think BNP have any widespread support any more.

The second point, eh, maybe. The problem with being overly negative is that while you may get another party's vote reduced by downvoters you need to make sure that is done by the floating voters. Getting core voters to downvote someone else rather than upvoting you could lead to you losing despite massive support. So it could even work the other way as parties battle to earn positive votes. which will be worth more in terms of outright winning.

EDIT: any game theorists around who can chip in?

Point by point:

- The UK is already saddled with debt. Scotland taking a proportionate share of it wouldn't really change much in real terms.

- Countries joining the EU have to commit to adopting the Euro, but one of the conditions for that is joining ERM II, which is voluntary. It's how countries like Sweden and Poland avoid adopting the Euro without specific opt-outs.

- It would indeed be enormously foolish to ""base [our] entire future upon oil reserves"". Which is why nobody's suggesting we do that. Obviously the Scottish government will want to get as much out of the North Sea as possible, but there's an increasing focus on renewable energy and technological industries as a means to provide a viable future economy.

Involved parents are concentrated in the private sector; if private schools didn't exist, they would be in the state sector, helping bring up standards. I don't think it will drag everyone down.

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"&gt; Isn't there also some debate as to which government would have claim to some of these facilities as well, because whilst they would be on Scottish land it would have been the British government who financed them?

Not really. It's pretty much recognised across the board that ~90% of the oil would belong to Scotland.

&gt;As for not joining the Euro, what other currency would they have?

The SNP maintain that a currency union would happen. While I think that, despite Osborne &amp; co's denial, it *will* be on the negotiating table in the event of a Yes vote, I myself would prefer a new Scottish currency pegged to Sterling. There are a few options.

&gt;What happens to even simply things like making a phone call?

...I don't really understand what you mean here. Scotland would presumably have a new international dialing code, but that's about it. Phones will still work up here.

&gt;What happens to those who work across the border?

They'll probably continue to work across the border.

&gt;What happens with regards to military and protection?

More than likely the military budget would be reduced (currently just over half of Scotland's contribution to the military is actually spent here). I believe Salmond has said that serving Scottish military personnel would have the choice of remaining in the UK armed forces or switching to the new Scottish ones.

&gt;What happens with regards to the BBC, etc?

Depends on the BBC, really. There's a BBC America, so I don't really see why retaining BBC Scotland should be any big deal.

If anything this makes those characters a better foil for the Doctor than characters like Amy Pond and River Song. Pond and Song are created by Moffat as toys for the Doctor. They don't serve as a foil so much as a plot device.

Companions like Rose, Martha, and Donna were there to show that the Doctor needed to embrace his humanity and that he couldn't just do whatever he likes whenever he likes.

true,74159637895123,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I remember hearing that certain specialists said that oil reserves within the UK, which I presume includes Scotland too, would begin to run dry in the next five years. All I am saying is that it seems silly that the country is basing its entire future upon oil, yet most people with common sense can surely realise that it will eventually run out and then what?

A few things with that, first is that the article you're talking about was if the UK became solely reliant on what it produces it would be self sufficient for about 5 years, not that there is 5 years worth of production left, there is 40 - 50 years at least (24 billion barrels with more expected to come online in the next few years).

The entire future of the country isn't being based on oil, it will act as a bonus to invest in the future, rather than being squandered like it is right now and has been since its discovery, oil is about 16% of the Scottish economy and the Scottish economy is about 120% of the UK average.

The oil will run out either way, and when that happens Scotland can either have invested the money in preparation for that inevitability, or it can stick onto the union and just hope that we dont become yet another place in the UK that is left to fail.

I have Irish teachers and friends, their country's past association with the UK isn't removed from history by them being a separate country, I don't believe in the whole ""stick together because my great granddad fought in a war with yours"", I'm alive now and I'll do what's right for nowadays, not yesteryear.

Moffat seems to have written an entire body of episodes where the main plot point is either ""the doctor is dying"" or ""the doctor is dead"" or ""the doctor is trapped"" or ""everyone in the universe is trying to kill the doctor"". He has taken the character from just being a really smart and important figure to literally being *the most important being and center of attention for every race in the universe*. Yes, he has diminished the role of female companions along the way, but IMO that is only because he has diminished the importance of *everyone other than the Doctor*.

I'd also suspect that you run in to the problem that a lot of these places that Thatcher killed off were the sort of places where ""jobs for life"" had held true for at least a few generations.  Such an environment works against long term, contingency, planning: as the jobs are for life there is not point saving up a lot of money... there will ALWAYS be a pay cheque. 

So there you go, exactly the same input but with a totally different output.  These areas, which are still struggling, need a lot of poking and prodding to find out why it's still a problem and to figure out a way to fix it.  Simply writing them off as 'sponger' areas encourages the mentality that anyone born and living there right now is a 'sponger' and 'lazy' and thus not worth employing.

How does it not? Laws affects the thing they are made about.

And also do you not think when arms are tightly controlled it's harder for people to acquire/own them illegally?

&gt;Wait so there is actually more to gun crime that guns? huh. 

Well of course. I havn't claimed anything else. In most cases trading off higher crime statistics with more non-violent crime and less violent crime is a good trade.

&gt;Hence why the ban was ineffective, there is more to any type of crime than the tools used. Bans (Like drugs) attempt (and fail) to fix the symptoms not the causes. 

But the amount of violent gun crime has been reduced. It's much harder to smuggle guns and to use guns and get away with it than drugs.

Of course there are social issues that affect crime rates. In an ideal society then I think guns should be legal, however we don't live in a perfect world and certain things need to be regulated for.

Scotland also receives less than it contributes as a percentage.

Never claimed there to be causation . If anything I'm saying there is no causation between our two gun bans and gun crime (Ie they are useless). You are implying correlation of legal pistols with more gun. You havn't shown any causation.

&gt;Also once gun crimes becomes illegal suddenly things involving fake firearms, previously legal firearms, etc

Fake firearms? Legal owners, like myself, will always hand guns in.. The police literally know every single gun I have , there is no option but to hand them in and as such comply with the law and not increase gun crime. 

&gt; once you make handguns illegal gun crime includes non-violent crimes such as owning a handgun.

The people who will own a handgun illegally would (criminals) would have owned them illegally before (Without licence) 

&gt;You havn't shown any causation.

I am not trying to, simply stating two undeniable facts.

&gt;

&gt;The __Ulster Protestant Volunteers__ were a [loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) and [fundamentalist Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Christianity) [paramilitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary) group in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). They were active between 1966 and 1969 and closely linked to the [Ulster Constitution Defence Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Constitution_Defence_Committee) (UCDC), established by [Ian Paisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley) and [Noel Doherty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Doherty) in 1966.

&gt;The UPV launched a [bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb) campaign to destabilise the [Northern Ireland government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council_of_Northern_Ireland), whose reforms they opposed. There were bombings on 30 March, 4 April, 20 April, 24 and 26 April. It also took part in most of the [counter-demonstrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-demonstrations) organised by Paisley in response to the [Catholic civil rights marches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association) of the late 1960s. One example of there many counter-demonstrations, was the [Battle of the Bogside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bogside) where the UPV along with many other loyalists were involved in throwing stones, bottles, and bricks at Catholic residents. The motto of the UPV was ""For God and Ulster"".  Many of its members also belonged to the [Ulster Volunteer Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Volunteer_Force_(1966\)).

So with the David Villa to NYCFC news, the question of what we allow in /r/MCFC and what must be diverted towards /r/NYCFC continues to go unanswered.

Rule 5. states:

&gt; Anything off topic will be removed. Anything wildly off-topic will be removed and may result in a ban. Posts about other members of the City Football Group are currently being considered on a case-by-case basis - if we feel that the post is of relevance to this subreddit it will be allowed. This policy will likely be revisited again in the future.

That's pretty vague, and deliberately so.  My thought is that big landmark events (major signings, trophy wins, etc.) and the odd summary of smaller events (things like season reviews, or perhaps even monthly round ups) can be posted here, but anything else should go to /r/NYCFC /r/CityFootballGroup or /r/MelbourneCity (all handily linked to in the upper right hand corner of the subreddit).

I still think I'm not being clear in my question for advice.

So for clarity. My credit card debt is due to a messy divorce. I had no option but to put my charges on my credit card after taking out a loan to cover the initial charges.

My outgoings currently cover minimum food, petrol and the remainder covers the debt I'm laden with.

This debt goes away after august when I cash in my initial 18k of shares. My outgoings will be approx £900 mth and that covers rent/food/petrol etc.

I'm then left with approx 34k of shares which I would like to get access to asap. If I leave them with equinti I get a charge of approx 3% each time I sell shares. Is there a better way to move these shares to an account and pay a flatrate on sale?

If i try and access any of the remaining 34k of shares then I am hit with a CGT charge as well as a sale charge. Can this be avoided, or mitigated?

If I leave the 34k in shares with the same company the shares could go down/up in value so 34k this year could be 30k or 50k next year.

What's the most tax efficient way I can secure this money without getting shafted by the taxman ?

If handguns are illegal then it is also normally illegal to carry around an imitation handgun 

And I didn't mean legal owners, I meant people who after the ban acquire guns which were once legal, illegally. 

&gt;The people who will own a handgun illegally would (criminals) would have owned them illegally before (Without licence) 

But when guns are illegal it is more difficult to acquire black market guns.

true,emorrp1,null,null,"To expand on the concept of emergency fund, at least as far as I understand the conventional wisdom, I don't think an ISA is the best vehicle for yours (skip to the fourth paragraph for the dominant reason).

The first stage of an ""emergency fund"" is there to prevent the need to live paycheck-to-paycheck, which should cover a full month of essential (and preferably discretionary) expenditure. This needs to be instant-access so if e.g. your biggest bills were erroneously double-charged, you can do an online transfer to cover the deficit within a two hours Faster Payment. Presumably you're not too worried about this since you've successfully managed to build up the fund, and you may in fact be using your debit account this way, I don't know. It's important to note the difference with this first stage, so that you can treat it differently from the main fund, while also noting that ISA isn't generally online instant-access.

Now the second stage of the fund is to plan for expected, but unpredictable, expenses e.g. car repairs (you can expect your car to break down, but can't know when) or reduced income (you can expect to lose some clients/have clients default at some point but are unlikely to know when). Therefore the name ""emergency fund"" is a bit of a mis-nomer, because these situations are only an emergency for those without one - once you have a fund, these expenses are no longer emergencies. Note that this should also be simple-access within say a week without long-term penalties e.g. a fixed-term bond would still be ok if you'd only forfeit N days of interest for early withdrawal.

An ISA is particularly bad in your contracting situation, since I would expect you to eventually reach the higher-rate taxpayer threshold, though you have plenty of leeway for now. Then you would really not want to dip into the ISA at all, since you might also be approaching the per-year investment limit too, preventing you from re-inserting the ISA money once the emergency has passed.

- Three's cheapest iPhone 5s plan is unlimited minutes and texts, and 1GB data. 2 year contract. £35 per month. £29 upfront cost for phone.  Cost over 2 years: £869.  This one gets you less data but more minutes.

As for the transfer request your telling of the story is different than my recollection and anything ive heard about it. As I recall the order of it went 40 million offer rejected, torres transfer request handed in, 50 million offer. This would obviously change the story to instead of doing it for the club, he did it because he got wind that he could jump ship. This is of course consistent with his anger towards the owners and his mercenary mentality.

To your final point, he should have been clear with management in the beginning that he wanted out. There is a way to handle it and a way not to. He may feel like a victim of circumstances but there are clearly things he could have done to better mitigate the damage to the club.

[England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) and [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) together form the constitutional successor to the former [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England) and follow a single [legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system), known as [English law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law).

The powers of the Assembly were expanded by the [Government of Wales Act 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_2006), which allows it to pass [its own laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Welsh_Law), and the Act also formally separated the [Welsh Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government) from the Assembly.

To say an 18 year old whose had one great season in the prem is a better fullback than him so azpi should take up the role and shaw LB is completely unfair on ivanovic. The only clear thing he needs to fix in his game is his ability to cross (which might i mention is extremely exaggerated by a lot of fans). The truth of the matter is is that we have a more than capable midfield filled with attacking creative players with the soon addition of a striker to fully carry out all the attack and intensity we need, and so its just my opinion that having a rb who is also great at attacking is merely a bonus.

However saying that, if the opportunity does rise making it possible that we can sign Shaw, it would be stupid not to take it - given of course it isn't for some ludicrous price as well as ridiculous wages.

true,Welshy123,null,null,"A bit of advice on the Aberdeen housing market.  Current selling prices are 15-20% above valuation right now.  There's a housing shortage and the oil industry just keeps expanding.  And the mortgage you get will be a loan to valuation - not to purchase price.  

So to get the best rates you'll want at least 25% of the valuation as a deposit then you'll have to pay the extra 15-20% on top of that.  So for a typical two bed of around £200k you'll need to offer £230-240k.  And with average credit you'll get a mortgage of 4x your salary (£112k).  So you might have to get a slightly less than average flat.  Or if you have good credit and can get a larger mortgage then you can pay a smaller percentage deposit and get a slightly higher rate of interest on your mortgage.  I don't know what you were budgeting for but I thought I'd throw that out there.

Aberdeen is pretty sheltered from UK economic fluctuations but is sensitive to the oil industry.  House prices have been shooting up recently and oil is expanding.

true,coriny,eng-GreaterLondon,London?,"I was being a little provocative, partly because I work in a highly skilled but very international industry with very free movement of people. And it works best like that, protectionism would be devastating for everyone.

But ... yes minimum wage is cheap labour, but if working conditions are equal (pay, hours etc) being equal you would normally hire the local because (a) language &amp; literacy (b) less likely to suddenly leave (e.g. to return home, or migrate elsewhere for a better opportunity). Which leaves the question - why would minimum wage jobs go to immigrants other the locals being lazy? I don't believe the latter, and I don't believe we have the lack of locals looking for unskilled jobs. The only answer I can think of is that illegal working conditions are the norm for minimum wage jobs held by migrants.

Your point on the driving down of low-level skilled jobs - how do I say that without coming across as a total arse? Genuine skills, essential to society &amp; economy, but widely held and relatively easy to obtain. Anyway, good point, I wonder if the solution is stronger professionalism, one that both benefits consumers and raises the barriers to entry. Builders in the UK had a terrible reputation until Europe-based companies and East European builders started working here - to the point that people preferred not to hire British. Whether or not that reputation was deserved, I don't know, but as a consumer it's still very difficult to identify trustworthy and competent builders firms (and vice versa, there are bad customers that the firms should share info on). Ultimately a UK builder with local knowledge of regulations, language, facilities &amp; good representation etc should have a competitive advantage over any recent migrant. Better professional bodies would add value leading to higher wages.

The automation thing is big, and possibly people underestimate the impact it will have. I was always on the side of automation leading to further job creation, and it does, but only of increasingly skilled and specialised jobs. As factory jobs &amp; agriculture vanished due to automation, people moved into transport - lorry drivers, taxi drivers etc. In a couple of decades these may well be fully automated - after all the robot taxi is safer for the customer, the robot truck is cheaper to run. What's the next alternative? I don't see it coming.[1]

Against this background I think we can exaggerate the impact of immigration very easily and lose sight of the macroeconomic changes.

The above poster is right, London is the key point here. No matter what you do, short of lying about where you live, it's going to be expensive. You might get away with not having fully comp but you really should have theft insurance, 125s are easy to pinch and get pinched a lot.

&gt;___Provincia Britannia___ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin); [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language): *British Province*; [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Talaith Prydain*), today known as __Roman Britain__, was a [province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province) of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) from 43 to 409, spanning at its height in 160, the southern three-quarters of the island of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain).  

&gt;Before the [Roman invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_invasion_of_Britain) began in 43 AD, [Iron Age Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Iron_Age) had already established cultural and economic links with [continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe), but the Roman invaders introduced new developments in [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture), [urbanisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanisation), [industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry) and [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture). Beyond the first few decades after the initial invasion, Roman historians generally mention Britannia only in passing. Thus, most knowledge of Roman Britain has derived from [archaeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology) investigations, and the [epigraphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy) evidence lauding the Britannic achievements of an [Emperor of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor), such as [Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian) (r. 117–38) and [Antoninus Pius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius) (r. 138–61), whose walls demarcated the northern borders of Roman Britain. 

&gt;[Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) conducted the first Roman campaigns in Britain in 55 and in 54 BC.   The conquest did not begin until AD 43, in the reign of the Emperor [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius).  Following the conquest of the native [Britons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britons_(historical\)), a distinctive [Romano-British culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romano-British_culture) emerged under [provincial government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province), which, despite steadily extended territorial control northwards, was never able to exert definite control over [Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonia). The Romans demarcated the northern border of Britannia with [Hadrian's Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall), completed around the year 128.  Fourteen years later, in 142, the Romans extended the Britannic frontier northwards, to the [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth)-[Clyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde) line, where they constructed the [Antonine Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Wall),  but, after approximately twenty years, they then retreated to the border of Hadrian's Wall.  Around the year 197, Rome divided Britannia into two provinces, [Britannia Superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britannia_Superior) and [Britannia Inferior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britannia_Inferior);  sometime after 305, Britannia was further divided, and made into an imperial [diocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_diocese).  For much of the later period of the Roman occupation, Britannia was subject to [barbarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian) invasions and often came under the control of imperial [usurpers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_usurpers) and pretenders to the [Roman Emperorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor).

&gt;Roman officials [departed from Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Roman_rule_in_Britain) around the year 410, which began the [sub-Roman period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Roman_Britain) (5th–6th centuries), but the legacy of the Roman Empire was felt for centuries in Britain.

The permanent transition period is something that could easily change given how the eurocrisis was exacerbated by a lack of EU central bank controlling currency. If Merkel and Co say they want a firm timetable for Scotland adopting the Euro now or in five years time there really isn't much Scotland can do.

The Schengen opt out is interesting because the SNP (although not the Scottish people) want a looser immigration policy to make their economic plans work and periphery nations will want easier access to Scotland for their citizens so having to lose that special deal probably wont be too unpleasant for the SNP negotiators. Still that will anger the 70% of Scots who want even tighter immigration controls and it might lead to stronger border controls for those traveling from Scotland to Ireland or the UK.

We have to prove to them that we're not scroungers - we have to prove to them that we deserve some gruel. It really is almost a Dickensian exploitation of the powerlessness of the working class.

I'm not bitter, I'm just dissillusioned with the horrible and callous way that jobseekers are treated. I've been kicked out of the system twice for things out of my control, leading me to serious financial difficulties at one point. What good is 'austerity' when the working class are kicked further into the gutter? What good is a welfare system that benefits most the ones who don't need it? 

The amount of jobs in the UK is shrinking as automation, technological progress and the economy impact the jobs market.

I think you are stereotyping more about Brits than Brits stereotype about foreigners. 

&gt; The receiving culture needs to be open to people integrating for it to work.

It's slightly more complex than that. The receiving culture needs to be to be open without being coerced into it. Generally the UK has been, far more accepting of immigrants than most other countries. But when people have it forced upon them excessively they (rightly) get resentful, not necessarily about the immigrants (who they don't blame) but about the change and the fact that they have had it foisted on them (the immigrants of which are a symptom).

&gt; How can they integrate when they can't participate in British culture without being labeled as a Muslim or some other bullshit label. 

They can integrate as much as they want. Count the number of turbans you see at a premier league fixture. See the number of niqab's the next time you go shopping. Immigrants can and do integrate and often choose to self-identify as British-other. These aren't bullshit labels, they are ways of balancing identities.

He's an attacking player, considering he's been used as a winger at times I don't know how you can deny his attacking leanings.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"So you think we should play like Liverpool, but use a formation that Liverpool hasn't used since the beginning of the season?  And you want to do it with 4 very attack minded players sitting in front of Gerrard + 1 other?  

The 4-2-3-1 doesn't afford Gerrard enough protection.  We experimented with all manner of different 2 and 3 man midfield setups and when there weren't 2 dedicated box to box players in there with Stevie we got played right through.  If Rooney doesn't recover 100% every time then the middle goes to hell.  You can't play him there.  His work ethic is incredible and he'll put in a defensive shift, but you're going to waste some of his outrageous attacking talent doing so or really expose the midfield, you can't have both.  

If England plays the diamond then they can do it, and IMO England has the players to really make that formation tick over if Hodgson gets his tactics right with it (ie not sitting deep playing long ball, which let's be honest, isn't going to happen :().  I think this formation and the way it allows Rooney to start as a striker but gives him basically total freedom is the one that maximizes his influence on the game, just like it does with Suarez.

If England lines up in a more orthodox 4-3-3, which has been our alternate formation when not playing the diamond in the second half of the season, then you have the same dilemma fitting Rooney and Sturridge in there that Liverpool has finding space for both Suarez and Sturridge.  One of them has to start on a flank, and then they get license to interchange and drift about.  This leaves that flank a bit exposed though (for Liverpool it was the left side and Cissokho can't attack to save 1000 kittens so we knew he'd be back as cover all the time), so whoever is the fullback over there has to really have his shit together.  When Liverpool plays this way they don't have a dedicated creative attacking midfielder per say, but the midfielders are all very much able to pick a pass and facilitate transitions very well.  Gerrard is Gerrard, Henderson has good vision and a great passing range, and the third midfielder (usually it was Coutinho who is a fucking magician) does just the same.

Pick your poison, diamond:

--------Gerrard--------

Henderson----Wilshere

--------Sterling-------

---Rooney--Sturridge---

Or 4-3-3:

--------Gerrard--------

Henderson----Wilshere

Sterling--Rooney--Studge

You can swap around Wilshere and Sterling for other players as you like, but I think Wilshere fits best in the middle and then Sterling is in the best form of the other attacking players.  I wouldn't be surprised to maybe see the likes of Milner instead of Wilshere (and the insane pressure that comes with Hendo+Milner in the middle is delicious) and Lallana over Sterling.  

Of course all of this becomes a sad joke when Hodgie lines up his 4-4-2 sitting deep and lobbing balls 60 years towards Sturridge.  I get that he has his preferences, and that he sets his teams up to be relatively risk-free.  There's something to be said for the pragmatic approach, but if the style he wants doesn't match the players he has available then he's the one who needs to adapt.  It's his job to get the best out of his players and in order to do that he has to cater to their strengths at least somewhat.

He made 0 mention of the tons of immigrants that are integrated, nope fuck them, he just labeled them all as 'non integrating' and how 'their behaviour is the problem' 

Thats what I mean, you could be a perfectly normal British person living your day to day life, but purely because you happen to be brown, people like /u/gomez12 blame you for the problems caused by other immigrants, 'oh its people like you that are the problem for not integrating, why do you guys behave like this?' You just get labeled with the same brush. 


&gt;These aren't bullshit labels, they are ways of balancing identities. 

It is a bullshit label, not every brown person is a muslim and yet a great majority of British people find it hard to make the distinction and just blame anything a muslim does onto everyone who is brown. 

But you can't point out this to them because they just moan about the 'pc crowd'. If you wan't to talk sensibly about immigrants you first have to understand that not every immigrant is the same bloody person in the first place. 

For people like /u/gomez12 it seems like his only distinction for an integrating immigrant and a non integrating immigrant is whether they are white or not. He labeled nearly every non-polish immigrant as 'having problems with wanting Sharia law, they follow religions banning marriage with whites'  and other blatantly ignorant statements that he just uses to tar every immigrant with. You can be a normal brown person living day to day like any other white Brit but apparently these are your problems as well and you need to deal with them according to people like him. There are a shit ton of non-muslim brown people who don't want sharia law, but oh no apparently they're all for it and don't integrate?


Take Sikhs for an example, they get hated on by Muslims because of their long history of conflict and then when they try to integrate with the Brits they get hated on again and just get labelled as a muslim and a worthless immigrant 'who don't bother to integrate and want sharia law'. Where do they stand? No where, because they are never accepted as Brits even if they want to be and they don't want to be labeled as a 'dirty immigrant' so they're stuck in the middle.


The reason why this debate is so hard and gets labeled as racist so often is because for some reason most British people are simply uncapable of making distinctions between immigrants and just label them all as one or label all of them as 'muslims'.

Why wouldn't it simply have increased at a greater rate? 

You should also consider that the overall murder numbers increased in that time, before falling off more recently. Why would the murder numbers increase? Why wouldn't that be the same cause as the gun crime increase? 

I also don't think your statistics of overall firearms offences really captures the important picture. 

It's most important to look at the firearms murder rate per 100,000 and compare with the firearms murder rate in a country where handguns are legal. At the end of the day, I care most if I or someone I love is killed, and this really addresses the argument that if citizens have access to fire arms it offers protection from criminals. 

We have 0.04 firearms homicides per 100,000.

The United States has 3.6 firearms homicides per 100,000.

The absolute murder rate per 100,000 people in those countries is 1.2 for the UK and 4.8 for the US. 

How, in any way, does that support an argument for firearms legalisation? 

Four times the murder rate, and 100 times the number of gun murders in a country with widespread access to firearms.

Oh yeah let's not forget.  Ivanovic is our primary target on punts and goal kicks as well!

Sorry to be snooty about it but the reason Azpi got shuffled to the left is because Ivanovic offers more overall influence on the game.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Look at the top post, all it did was label all immigrants(the brown ones anyway) and 'their behaviour' as the 'problem'. He made 0 mention of the tons of immigrants that are integrated, nope fuck them, he just labeled [sic] them all as 'non integrating' and how 'their behaviour is the problem' 

I don't think he was referring to immigrants that had integrated. He appeared to be referring to those that haven't e.g. :

&gt; But immigrants from many other countries keep to themselves, live in areas populated by people from the same background, they don't date and marry Brits (many of them follow religions explicitly banning this) and many have outdated views on family, marriage, gender equality, sexuality and children.

This explicitly refers to those who do not integrate. It certainly explicitly does not reference immigrants who do not do these things.

&gt; It is a bullshit label, not every brown person is a muslim

But some are and some self-identify as British-Muslim. *They* make the label for themselves, not anti-immigrant types appending it to them without their consent. Others as British-Indian, British-Caribbean or British-whatever.

&gt; For people like /u/gomez12 it seems like his only distinction for an integrating immigrant and a non integrating immigrant is whether they are white or not.

I think you are misunderstanding and misrepresenting the point he was making, which wasn't about skin colour, but culture. The proximity of the UK and Poland is indicative that they will have more similar cultures than places on the other side of the globe. 

&gt; If you wan't [sic] to talk sensibly about immigrants you first have to understand that not every immigrant is the same bloody person in the first place. 

Yet you and I are having this discussion without being hostile to one another despite having disparate views. Political Correctness doesn't censor those on the political correct side of the debate, but for those preaching against it, it can have serious repercussions. If you haven't experienced that be grateful and make some allowance for those who have.

&gt; He labeled nearly every non-polish [sic] immigrant as 'having problems with wanting Sharia law, they follow religions banning marriage with whites'

He said ""*immigrants from many other countries*"", this is not the same things as ""*nearly every non-Polish immigrant*"". Furthermore, Islam does ban marriage to non-Muslims and some Muslims do want to see sharia law in the UK, so he has not said anything that is inaccurate or racist in this statement. 

Whilst I'm not the most objective observer in this situation, it does appear that you are looking to find racism in his statements because he is talking about race/racial issues in a manner that you disagree with. But he wasn't tarring ""every immigrant"", nor even every brown immigrant. He was differentiating between those who do integrate and those who don't and that, to my mind, is not only not racism, it's exactly the sort of level-headed discussion we should be having (to put right misconceptions if nothing else).",0,1401389063,null,0,false,0,chu6ybv,t3_26qhbm,t1_chu6ybv,t1_chu613e,null,1434007841,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

First is from when I used to deliver pizzas. I had been delivering for about 4 years at this point and knew all the regulars. One guy was a British dude with a thick accent name John. I was a cold night, and I had a Chelsea jacket in the back of my car so I threw it on. Some time later in the night, John placed an order and I was the one to take it. When I arrived he saw the jacket and got all excited. We talk about Chelsea for a little while, then he goes, ""Wait here I have to go get something"" and runs into the back of his house. About 5 minutes later he comes back out with an England jersey and says, ""Here. You take this. I've had too many beers and it will never fit me again."" Plus I got a $3 tip on top of that.

Another one was just a couple months ago. I was running one of those obstacle course 5Ks and I threw my Lampard jersey in my bag to wear after the run was done. So I finish the race and switch into the jersey and about 10 minutes later I hear two girls behind me singing, ""Supah, Supah Frank. Supah, Supah Frank. Supah, Supah Frank. Supah Frankie Lampard."" I turn around and there are the most California looking 14 year old girls singing this at me. How they got interested in Chelsea, I'll never know.

If you're happy with a semi-rough pub, and don't want a bar, the Castle is open until 2am most nights so worth knowing where it is.

Music, pretty much just the arts centre these days since the oliver twist is gone. Loads going on there, and hosts the colchester beer festival. Go to the summer one if you can, as the outside is open. Gets too busy in the winter due to everyone being inside.

Avoid our nightclubs, best to hop on a train. If you enjoy indie/punk music, check out Camden in the north of London, and there's often gigs at the east Anglian uni in Norwich. You can normally see a gig there and still catch the last train home.

Well we can't know for sure. What we do know is we have had less restrictive laws and had *much* less gun crime, if we have already had it why can't we have it again?

&gt;I also don't think your statistics of overall firearms offences really captures the important picture.

It doesn't because gun crime (as with all crime) isn't only effected by gun laws (or say drug laws in the case of drug crime) there are more factors at play, social economic factors. These are the things we should be sorting, not pointless feel good bans.

I'm going to completely ignore your comparison to US as its irrelevant. Farage isn't saying US legal pistol style, He's saying UK legal pistol style circa 70's-80's.  

Want to compare? compare to our own country when the laws where what he's asking for. 

So lets compare us to us (much more relevant and fair!)

1969: Population of UK (including NI) 55 million [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Vital_statistics_1960_-_2012) gun crime in the year 1,308 [Source](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2Fsn01940.pdf&amp;ei=foKHU6PeM5Sw7AaAh4CIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH6atVDylpEjVwNHfABXpLQLKybg&amp;sig2=beUL8aJnWYMyI6kWvAkQug&amp;bvm=bv.67720277,d.ZGU) (PDF) 2.3 per 100,000 

2010: Population of UK 66 million gun crime for the year 11,227 so 18.1 per 100,000 

And for fun: 2002 would be about 40 per 100,000 .

My numbers wrong? Per 100,000 would actually be higher if you removed NI from population but I can't be assed.

Disabled are only excluded if they need an bedroom for a carer that stays overnight.  If you are like myself and need a room to house motability scooter, oxygen tanks, etc - you are not excluded.  

http://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/bedroom-tax

&gt;However, the Government does not accept that the Gorry judgment also provides for an extra bedroom with respect to disabled adults - for example where the claimant is one of a couple who is unable to share a bedroom or where an extra room is required for equipment connected with their disability.

&gt;It therefore has no plans to introduce new housing benefit regulations that provide for an extra bedroom with respect to disabled adults.

Also, discretionary housing payments are temporary, meant to give someone time to move to a smaller home.  If you need the extra room for equipment, then this is pretty pointless as when the award ends, you are still going to be hit by the bedroom tax.

Private schools, both independent and public, are self funded charities. The wealthy pay for their children to be educated and the schools are required to provide other children subsidised spaces. As I have said 75% of my peers were subsidised. In my class I had the children of teachers and electricians, as well as the children of multi millionaires who sponsored local football teams. Anyone could afford to send their child to my school. Grammar schools however are solely based on catchment and ability so you pay for your child to be privately tutored (as the majority of my grammar schooled friends were) to get pass the exam and you pay a massive premium to live in the catchment. Private schools no doubt perpetuate inequality; it's obvious that a good education is invaluable at progressing in life. That is undeniable. However, grammar schools are a disgrace in terms of inequality. Only the wealthy can afford to live in the catchment and the private tutoring.   Private schools can be highly effective at helping the poor to gain access to better education however grammar schools, in my experience, only help the middle classes hold onto their wealth.

Explain the difference, please.

&gt; I'm going to completely ignore your comparison to US as its irrelevant

Why would it be irrelevant? It's certainly not less relevant than data from forty years ago! You just don't like the stats.

[As for air guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime)...

This is FY12/13 data. 11,227 recorded offences involving (by addition of the records) 8,075 firearms, of which 4,202, or 52%, are air guns and imitation fire arms. 2,256 are handguns, which is *by far* the preferred criminal weapon, comparing to just under 300 shotgun, 200 sawn off shotgun, and 50 rifle crimes. 

What does the tell you about which firearms should have the strictest controls? What does it tell you about offences with 'firearms' that are most loosely controlled?

In addition, there were 30 firearms homicides in this period. [In 1996, there were 84.](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compareyears/192/number_of_gun_homicides) This would be in the face of a reduced population. How can you stand and argue that we were safer then than now?

&gt; So per capita when we had much laxer laws we where much safer from gun crime.

Conclusion not found in evidence! All the evidence about murders points to the contrary. And even if it was true - *why hasn't it worked in the US?* 

You HAVE to explain why their murder rate is 4 times higher and their firearms murder rate 100 times higher if you want people to believe that access to firearms makes life safer!

I should point out that my dad has a firearms licence, and both him and my mother have shot since university - well before licensing was so strict.

Massively variable. Generally speaking, London is phenomenally expensive, the SE of England is expensive, and rent gets cheaper as you go north.

I don't think you'd need one, seeing as you're from Iceland, which is part of the EEA. I checked using [this tool](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa/y/iceland).

It's extremely short-sighted to continue to mention the ""amicizia"" (friendship) bit, but the club seems to use it still (possibly because it's what the plaque says).

This all being said, Juve supporters feel as though the act was never apologized for and that people weren't prosecuted. They were. Were they given adequate sentences? No. Was everyone prosecuted? No. Could LFC do anything about that? Sadly, no. I think a lot of Liverpool supporters would prefer to express sadness and condolences over Heysel, but, personally, it feels as if they cannot be talked to at all by Liverpool FC or its supporters.

1. Nearly all of the stats you've included were defensive ones, which is obviously Tiago's strong suit whereas the other two (Vidal in particular) would be signed for their ability to get forward as well as create from deep, and would certainly improve their defensive stature under Mourinho.
2. It leaves out the most important stat of them all when comparing these three: their age. Tiago is 33, which is why I don't understand the fact that we're interested at all, especially as a replacement for an aging Lampard. Vidal is 27, in his prime but still with some ability to improve the mental aspects of his game, especially defensive positioning. And Pogba is 21, massively talented, massive potential.

For me it's a no-brainer between the three. Pogba fits our current transfer model of buying exciting youngsters and could be around for a very long time. As unrealistic as the numbers people are throwing out may sound, we do have a fairly massive warchest this summer with the increased revenue and the Luiz sale. Even if we pay 70m for Pogba and 40m for Costa, we'll still be right around our expenditure in the last few seasons.

Talk to me when Soldado attempts to renegotiate his contract.  Right now I'm pretty sure he understands he has little leverage.

This is just flat-out opinion, and you're comparing apples to oranges regardless.  Soldado is a good player, and Ade is a good player, and both have suffered bouts of being out of favor either due to their play or their managers' poor job of playing them properly.  But Ade is far more expensive than Soldado on a per-year basis, and is older to boot.

2. May 19, 2012. Taking the subway to watch the game at my friend's house and across the train I spot another fellow Blue in his gear. We both look at each other, give the nod, and continue on. Very good feeling connecting with someone without even having to speak a word.

&gt;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the ""Clean Break"" report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on ""Western values"". **It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"".**

Here's the full paper...

http://www.dougfeith.com/docs/Clean_Break.pdf

Then a year later, the same plan was made in a US think tank policy document populated by the Neocons who are the biggest Israeli cheerleaders.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century

&gt;The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in 1997 as a non-profit educational organization founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. The PNAC's stated goal is ""to promote American global leadership.""[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that ""American leadership is both good for America and good for the world"" and support for ""a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.""[2] **With its members in numerous key administrative positions, the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.**

Full document here...

http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf

When the Wikipedia article says ""with it's members in key administrative positions"" it means all the people that signed the PNAC document in principal and who's members included those who wrote the document for Israel. They were the ones that were in the Bush Administration who executed the plans they'd laid out in 1996.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Associations_with_Bush_administration

They did this because the same people had tried to get Saddam Hussein out before via CIA backed coups but failed on several occasions because of poor planning and lack of assets in Iraq. Saddam found their plans on more than one occasion and murdered everyone involved. It states quite clearly in the Clean Break report for Israel that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to Israel's national security and they should remove him. Funnily enough, as that was stated first by Israel and America eventually did it, it also is highly suspicious that it's mentioned in the same document Syria should be taken out by ""proxy war and highlighting their weapons of mass destruction"" which once again has come to fruition spear headed by the US.

I've already posted this before but it's a very good timeline which shows what I've expanded on in my post but goes into greater deal overall.

Literally too different to say fully , they have a constitutional right to own guns and we have some of the strictest laws in the world . Assume everything to be the complete opposite of what we have. 

&gt;Why would it be irrelevant?

Because of the above, Nobody is asking for US style laws so comparing to US makes no sense, compare to a country with the laws we are asking for... Ie UK circa 1960-80s. 

&gt;What does the tell you about which firearms should have the strictest controls?

Depends what you mean by controls, I have no problem with pistols under licence (Ie our current system, and what we have previously had). 

&gt; How can you stand and argue that we were safer then than now?

How many firearm homicides did we have in the 70's and 80's ? 96 was a peak in firearm crime (despite the pistol ban and semi auto 10 years before it)

&gt;Conclusion not found in evidence!

The data I provided is extremely clear:

1969: 2.3 per 100,000 (lax laws)

2010: 18.1 per 100,000 (currently laws)

The above could not be clearer. 

&gt;why hasn't it worked in the US?

Because they have a completely different system than us, literally the complete opposite in every single way. Irrelevant what the US is doing or has done. 

&gt;You HAVE to explain why their murder rate is 4 times higher and their firearms murder rate 100 times higher if you want people to believe that access to firearms makes life safer!

You have to explain why when the system we asking for has PROVEN UNDENIABLY to exist with MUCH lower gun crime in OUR country not the US. 

&gt;What possible benefit would it bring, in the face of all the evidence saying more people die when you have easier access to firearms?

1969: 2.3 per 100,000 (lax laws)

2010: 18.1 per 100,000 (currently laws)

People give him a lot of stick for his performances on the right because of the shot frequency, but I think there were a variety of factors underlying this. These shots also established an illusion that he was more predictable on the right, when in reality he actually created more problems with the unpredictability because the defenders were constantly thinking he was ready to shoot (hence him always being double-teamed while playing right).

It was *you* that first used the term 'sectarian schools'. You implied that, not me. I don't think schools make children sectarian, but the lack of awareness and interaction of other groups leads to a lack of knowledge and understanding, and eventually the type of narrow-minded thinking that we see in our country every day! What I'm telling you is that segregated schools make children narrow-minded - naturally. It's only to a greater degree if a child grows up in a household where racist and sectarian attitudes prevail. 

It's not social engineering to make schools integrated, just about every school in the world outside of Northern Ireland (I mean especially in the West) is an integrated school. It is NOT normal to segregate students according to their religious traditions. 

It IS normal to grow up and experience different cultures and ethnicities. 

It is well understood that those who travel abroad and live in multiple countries are much more tolerant and open-minded than those who shelter themselves in a corner of their country listening to the same teachers and preachers. 

&gt; All you'd get by forcing integration is a lot more bullying

*That* is total bullshit. Why not go talk to the teachers at some of our existing integrated schools and ask them if children are bullied more? I highly doubt it, and I know from personal experience that those who went to integrated schools are more tolerant of others.

&gt;

&gt;__Rickie Lee Lambert__ (born 16 February 1982) is an English [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays as a [striker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)) for [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) club [Southampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.) and the [England national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team). Lambert began his career at [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool_F.C.), having been previously dropped by Liverpool as a youngster. He later played at [Macclesfield Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macclesfield_Town_F.C.), [Stockport County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockport_County_F.C.), [Rochdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_A.F.C.) and [Bristol Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Rovers_F.C.), before moving to Southampton in 2009.

&gt;Lambert proved a key signing for Southampton, becoming their top scorer as they were promoted to the [Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship) in 2010 and to the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) the following season. He has won a number of personal awards, including three league Golden Boots. Lambert is known for his large stature and physical performances, drawing comparisons with Southampton legend [Matthew Le Tissier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Le_Tissier) for his ability in front of goal and penalty taking ability. 

&gt;On 8 August 2013, Lambert was called up to the [England team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team) for the first time.   On 14 August 2013 he scored on his England national team debut at [Wembley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_stadium) in a friendly against [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team) with his first touch. On 12 May 2014, he was named in the England squad for the [2014 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup).

I don't think that you can divorce education from the society around it though. The problem isn't really our schools in as much as the way our society is structured and the school are symptomatic of this.

If we want a school system to equalise outcomes and to make sure that social mobility is fluid, we need a society that is ready for that. Countries in Europe were prepared for that for various reasons. Finland's history is basically trying to raise a nation to survive in the face of ongoing threats from Russia and previously, Sweden. There's an ingrained civic quality deep within that society.  

However, we haven't had the same influences, so our Public Schools and Grammar schools are actually remnants of a class system that hasn't truly gone away which still asserts itself in everything from the way we speak to the way we socialise.

Ever heard of ""belfast""?

It's a game that I and lots of people in Belfast played as kids. Ring the doorbell and run. In spring time when the buds were on the flowers it was ""bud the windies"". Take flower bud or tiny berry, ping the windie, run like fuck before some adult would come out and get you. Not malicious at all btw. (you wouldn't have done it to old people or anything like that, would do it to your friends dad or your own dad while the match was on)

Both ""games"" meant that someone chased you eventually. Which I think was the point to be honest. I specifically remember two people that were good for chases. You didn't even have to ring their doorbells. Merely bounce a ball in the street and they would come out shouting. Laugh and they would chase you up the street.

As for the ""doors being kicked"". That's usually the preserve of a tryhard tough kid attempting to be cool in front of friends (extreme belfast). Or maybe the ""new version"" of belfast. **OR A BALL**. Saying that, belfast was completely full of terrace houses with no front gardens, there still are streets like that so door kicking or more commonly, i suspect **window rapping** could be really common their for mischievous kids.

I wouldn't worry, it's probably just some kids going through a stage of realising that if you ring someones doorbell or bang their door, (invade their space) they get pissed and sometimes chase them. 

Ignore.... if you respond then they will want to do it again, especially if you chase them. 

Word will spread among the kids.

Areas I've heard to avoid are Spring Burrows (around the train station) and a few areas on the very outskirts of the town.The Mounts is an area that's a little bit rough around the edges but has some interesting factory conversions there, some excellent pubs, and is close to town. Abington is quite a large area I suppose and has some bad parts, ok parts and extremely nice parts (Abington Vale)!

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"Camden, Islington, Brixton, Wembley.... there are a lot of successful multicultural 'bubbles' in London - and there are plenty of places like Hackney, Neasdon, etc where there's little but huge poverty problems and still they have lots of integration, especially among the youth.
  
It depends on what you call integration though, if it's conforming to a bland normative then no one in London has ever done that, not the pearly queens, those doing the Lambeth walk or any cockney ever; but if it's cultural exchange and mutually beneficial co-existence then yes it's thriving in London.  Which is why the ukip scare stories don't make sense to Londoners.
  
admittedly i have no idea what the north of England is like but surely it's no less grim than it ever was, the problems there kinda started with immigration but it's maybe better described as the forced relocation of thousands of impoverished small landholders and tenured peasants during the great land clearances and work-house era.  If suburban Birmingham has problems then that's nothing new, it's only in the last few decades the people in charge have seriously considered it should actually be a nice place to live - but is multiculturalism the problem or part of the solution? it's totally impossible to tell, one thing though that's worth noting is that immigration had enriched the culture of the City in many ways, even their official tourism website proudly proclaims no trip to the city is complete without experiencing [balti triangle](http://visitbirmingham.com/birmingham-areas/birmingham/balti-triangle/) which i'll admit now i know it exists kinda makes we wanna visit brum... (also the gay village seems pretty cool, although i think maybe i've let my imagination run away with me already, I'm sure it doesn't actually look like the Olympic opening ceremony....)  
  
the whole 'look at this one potentially bad immigrant!' or 'OMG IMAGIEN IF THIS HAPPENS!!!!!1' stories which are so common completely miss the fact that there are loads of immigrants which are helping our country move into the twenty first century - doctors, nurses, cooks, IT specialists, scientists, authors, disco fanatics - the people a society needs.  
  
If i asked if you want something in your house that kills thousands of people every year, which is destroying the planet and will cost you hundreds if not thousands of pounds a year then of course you'd say no - yet you probably already own a car, you were probably very happy when you got it and you'd probably argue most vehemently if i tried to take it off you.  That's because you know all the things that a car helps you do, you know how useful and enjoyable a car is.

No, I didn't. By 'sectarian schools' I meant schools where sectarianism is institutionalised (by pupils and their parents), the staff have nothing to do with it. 

You're more than implying it by suggesting that throwing everybody into the same schools is going to magically cure sectarianism.

One problem with that: sharing NI doesn't make people any less sectarian, sharing streets with bigots doesn't magically make them tolerant, it just leads to all the racist attacks we're seeing in East Belfast by putting people right into the lion's den.

&gt;It is well understood that those who travel abroad and live in multiple countries are much more tolerant and open-minded than those who shelter themselves in a corner of their country listening to the same teachers and preachers. 

The recent elections in Europe would seem to disprove that theory. England and France, two of the most diverse countries in Europe are also the two that swung most heavily towards racist parties.

&gt;That is total bullshit. Why not go talk to the teachers at some of our existing integrated schools and ask them if children are bullied more? I highly doubt it, and I know from personal experience that those who went to integrated schools are more tolerant of others. 

Yes, which is entirely due to the fact that it's opt-in. The people most likely to send their children to integrated schools are those who are least likely to be sectarian.

What will end sectarianism is alleviating poverty. It's not a coincidence that racism is on the rise in Europe at the same time as living standards are falling. 

NI is one of the poorest parts of Western Europe; the fact that bigotry is institutionalised here, especially among the poorest parts of the region, is not a coincidence either.

But not far enough back to be relevant. 

&gt;You keep asserting that data you don't like is irrelevant, and you never explain why.

Because farage and I want gun laws like we had in the 60's-80's so use  60's-80's data. Simple. 

The US is irrelevant because we are not talking US style laws, we are talking UK style laws so lets use UK data !!! 


&gt;A theory as to why relaxed gun laws will reduce gun homicides

I have never said relaxed laws will reduce gun homicides, merely proved that relaxed laws can exist with lower (much lower) gun crime. This is a proven fact I have shown by comparing our crime now with our crime in the 60's-80's. No need to involve another country we have the data and experience right here. 

&gt;An explanation as to why this has not occurred in the US that does not contradict the above

Because the US does not have and has never had the same laws as us in recent times (Unless you go back to UK in 1900's which actually had low crime rates still...) 

&gt;An explanation as for why you do not believe the falling gun death figures indicate that the ban is working

Correlation doesn't equal causation.

Even if the US was a relevant comparison, its needlessly complicated. why compare to another country (With varying social, economic factors) when we can compare to our own country!?!

It's very simple, we want the laws **exactly** the same as the **UK** (not the US! US is not relevant!) as we had in the 60's-80s. You want to know what would happen to crime? lets look at what the crime rates were **in the UK** in the  **60's-80s** ! This is the beauty of it, we don't have to hypothesise what we are asking for has already existed, already happened in our country and we have the data for it! there is not a single need to mention the US or any other country.

I see muslim women wear hijabs, whereas the men walk around in T-shirts.  I see a religion which treats women like second class citizens and I see an ideology which falls to condemn slavery and shows hatred for non-believers.

Show me the 60-80s data on gun homicides.

You can't run from gun murder statistics. The data I've given you, **including from before the 1996 ban** shows a fall over time.

However, you go on to say

&gt; Correlation doesn't equal causation.

Which is quite true. 

So you have to tell me, then, why you think *correlating* your asserted, totally fictional lower gun crime figures with less restrictions on fire arms would show it's a good thing to do?

The way to demonstrate a causative relationship is to identify and prove a mechanism of action. You've repeatedly failed to do this, despite my asking. You can't. Without that, why should I believe your fantasy that gun crime rates would magically revert to 1970s figures? Again taking in to account that you've not given the gun homicide figures and the data I've provided shows a downward trend over time.

The US **is** relevant, because you have to show me, for me to believe that lower gun crime is linked to freer gun access, the mechanism which achieves that. You then **have to explain** why this mechanism is not occurring in the US!

He'll be a year older, and if there's no improvement, his confidence isn't going to get dented like it has this season. It's going to be shattered, and we'll all hate him come next season if that's the case. He'll have no value on the market (maybe 8-10 million if we're lucky), and we'll be stuck with a striker who had so much promise and returned so little.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

Sadly, the MFX does now count as screen accurate because Doctor Who's prosthetics are done by MFX, when Neil Gorton heard that they were having trouble getting a sonic sorted for David's return (one was given to him and the others have all been lost at various points. Oh BBC.) he offered up a selection of his (many) unsold MFX replicas.

If you live particularly frugally, and have help from family, it's possible to save enough to have the occasional luxury.

Mental health is also a good reason to allow that. Can you imagine life with zero luxuries (TV, internet, phone, friends etc)? How long would it be before you're a gibbering wreck, no use to anyone?

I have a £150 TV and an internet connection, and I'm on benefits. Unlike most people who have a TV while on benefits, I didn't buy it before I found myself out of work, nobody else gifted it to me, and I didn't get it on some extortionate credit scam like Bright House. I saved. It took a long time, but I did it. Other people tend to do it those other ways. I can safely say that it's a blessing though. Long hours of jobsearch need to be followed by decent leisure breaks, otherwise, what do you have but four walls, depression and despair?",0,1401407487,null,0,false,0,chufi5w,t3_26s3f1,t1_chufi5w,t1_chud4h0,null,1434011956,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

As for hip areas, I could go on for days, BUT I'll recommend a few places and you can go from there:

Pepper Rocks - A hidden away cocktail bar that also serves fantastic pancakes and crepes, right in the city centre.

Brass Monkey - My favourite cocktail bar in Nottingham. It's in the Lace Market area and is open til late to accommodate the local bar staff (I'm a bartender, so I'm slightly biased).

Edin's Natural Bistro - Amazing little place in Hockley, feels like you've walked into a 1920's French café when you walk in. Lots of home-made food and desserts, great shout.

Wired Cafe - A trendy little coffee shop in Hockley, right next to the main square, often features work from local artists and photographers on the walls. Recommend their White Mocha coffees and Nanaimo Bars.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

Whilst that is an extremely difficult thing to go through, I don't believe there are any rights or wrongs emotionally when it comes to unexpected deaths. Had you not been there, you could have berated yourself for not being there, and you could do so for many years to come. Having been there, you are no doubt blaming yourself for all the things you could not do to help him.

Looking at this situation from an outsider's perspective, I see two things. Firstly, as a nation we really lack basic medical knowledge and skills, but if we take the time to train ourselves, we can all help people we care about and strangers in times of need. I believe that children in schools should all receive basic medical training for situations such as this, but hey, I like to dream.

Secondly and most importantly, your father died in the presence of you, his son, who he no doubt loved dearly. It's really important to realise that he did not pass away only in the arms of strangers, an ambulance man, in a car collision with a stranger, and even, if we are to be dramatic, in your mother's view; whilst it may seem extremely hard to have the memory you have right now, I'm almost certain that you would rather take that memory than let your mother take it in your place. It's by no means right or fair that you witnessed your father's death, but, by means of making this post, and given the choice, I believe you would take seeing what you saw over having your mother see it instead.

It's a traumatic experience in our lives when we lose our parents and I am sad that I cannot find the right words to comfort you, except to say that I think that witnessing a passing is something a younger generation can recover from slightly better than  your father's generation.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

A lot of Rose's problems were the result of very poor triangles of passing being presented to him, which made his passing and ball concessions appear all the worse because he was isolated and in those positions it was very easy for the opponent to counter or even release into the space left behind by Rose.

This would inevitably cut down on the adaptation period, and likely massively benefit the whole team. 

Saborit is a young player at Atletico Bilbao who started under Biesla, and scored six goals from the position in that time (mere two years). He's since slipped down the pecking order with the new coach, and as such I think he'd be perfectly willing to come, very cheap, young, and would require little less time for transition due to being familiar with these tactics.

true,FlappyBored,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; I don't think he was referring to immigrants that had integrated. 

I think he did. The only mention of immigrants that he thinks are 'integrated' were the polish, he made out that everyone else simply doesn't integrate, as if there wasn't a non-polish immigrant who is integrated into the UK at all. 


&gt;If you haven't experienced that be grateful and make some allowance for those who have.

If you haven't experienced being called a paki or a 'immigrant fuck who doesn't bother to integrate' or get told 'why don't you bloody muslims sort your lot out?' despite not being muslim or an immigrant or tried to integrate with the Brits only to be rebuffed and had racial abuse hurled at you like so many immigrants have be grateful and make some allowance for those who have.


&gt;But some are and some self-identify as British-Muslim. They make the label for themselves, not anti-immigrant types appending it to them without their consent. Others as British-Indian, British-Caribbean or British-whatever.

Why do you think they give themselves these labels? Because they aren't allowed to fully integrate, people never see them as just British. If they try to take pride in British history or culture they just get told 'This isn't your history, your families a bunch of immigrants, they weren't even here'. Do anything wrong its 'go back to India you bloody immigrant', they reply 'I was born here' they get 'no you werent fuck off back to where your parents came from you immigrant'. 

Whats a brown British person supposed to do? They walk down the street and the first thing people like /u/gomez12 think is 'Bloody immigrant, probably keeps his wife in a cupboard'.

&gt;I think you are misunderstanding and misrepresenting the point he was making, which wasn't about skin colour, but culture. The proximity of the UK and Poland is indicative that they will have more similar cultures than places on the other side of the globe.

Really, I highly doubt that. There could be a polish immigrant who hasn't bothered to integrate at all, doesn't speak english and a normal British person who just happens to be brown but doesn't like to drink alcohol and I would bet money on the fact that /u/gomez12 would say the polish person is more integrated and British than the brown dude.

&gt;He said ""immigrants from many other countries"", this is not the same things as ""nearly every non-Polish immigrant"". Furthermore, Islam does ban marriage to non-Muslims and some Muslims do want to see sharia law in the UK, so he has not said anything that is inaccurate or racist in this statement. 

Yes it is, really what did he mean by 'many other countries' other than ones where predominantly non-whites come from then? [According to Gomez, people like this simply do not exist. They're all in a mosque praying 5 times a day and figuring out ways to set up Sharia law zones or wipe out homosexuals.](http://www.glennguan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/manutd-f5.jpg) Also its their fault for problems involving other immigrants, either them or their parents 'behaviour' has caused pedo rings. 

&gt;. Furthermore, Islam does ban marriage to non-Muslims and some Muslims do want to see sharia law in the UK, so he has not said anything that is inaccurate or racist in this statement.

Yes it is because he's using it to tar all non-white immigrants with. Exactly what I mean, not every god damn brown person is a muslim. That is racism, taring every brown person as a muslim. 'Whats that he's a brown immigrant? Bet he's a muslim who doesn't integrate and follows sharia and bans his daughter from marrying white men, damn I hate him so much for not integrating.' How many white people would object to their daughter wanting to marry a foreigner or a muslim? I reckon you would find the statistic a bit uncomfortable.


&gt;But he wasn't tarring ""every immigrant"", nor even every brown immigrant. 

Yes he was, he did it explicitly by making comments like 'Its the immigrants behaviour' and 'the immigrants don't help themselves'. If he doesn't make the distinction then its clear he's just taring every immigrant with the same brush.

**tl;dr: not every asian is a hardline muslim extremist  and you *ARE* a racist if you keep on failing to make the distinction.**

In fact even go look through his posting history, he even admits that 'when Bangladeshis and somalis get together its unexpected dodgy shit is going to go down' to me that sounds might racist and not just 'Oh its a fair comment about immigration PC patrol out in force!'.

edit- Actually, looking through his posting history I think it would be fair to label him as a racist tbh.

I do think that a proper LW in front of and a mobile yet aware CDM in support of Rose could work absolute wonders for his game. Would allow him to calm down, pick out the better pass, and focus on holding better positions as a result. I think with this mental calm, his passing and crossing just may improve significantly.

However, I do think we'll need to bring in another LB option. Fryers is not the type of fullback to work in Poch's system, and as a result I think he'll be pushed further towards developing as a CB, even if he doesn't see first choice minutes anytime soon. As such, I think bringing in a young, cheap option familiar with Poch and/or Biesla's tactics to compete with Rose would be very beneficial. 

Nonetheless, I very much appreciate your input and I'm delighted to see someone stand up for a minority-held opinion. Far too many incidents of people declaring a rogue opinion on here or other Spurs boards and getting wrecked for it.

To answer that question I would say what you plan on doing isn't out of the question but won't be that easy either. Securing a job here as a German speaker with a ok but imperfect grasp of English won't be a walk in the park, that said plenty of immigrants live here. Living on minimum wage without any additional support is difficult. You should probably save up as much as you can before moving, secondly you should do your best to secure a job before you move, thirdly you should choose an area of the UK where there is both employment prospects and a low cost of living, finally try and get into contact with other people who have done the same and find out how they accomplished their move. Finding somewhere to live when you arrive will be difficult too, you should probably look into cheap temporary, potentially shared, accommodation when you arrive, because rentals tend to be at least 6 months and require deposits and proof of employment. Funnily I'm looking to travel to Germany this year so we're in similar boats. Viel glück! Ich hoffe, dass Sie ihre Ziele erreichen können.

Some suggestions.

- If you're going to use the shield I'd go with the traditional Iberian style over the French/English heater style shield, as the former is the one used in the arms of the borough. (I'd forego the shield altogether though)

- I'd use the lion in the classic design (the one OctaChaz posted) because everyone loves a throwback

-  The staff and lion are already taken from [Chelsea's coat of arms](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Chelsea_arms.png), maybe consider taking some design elements from [Kensington and Chelsea's coat of arms](http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmgallery/general/democracy/large/vm_lg_0025.jpg). The Bush of Broom crest could be an interesting backdrop to the Lion. The Crowns on ermine, and the Abbot's Mitre could also be incorporated, the crowns would be cool though. 

- Latin on the crest could be interesting. It's not used often and the only other clubs I can think of using it in the PL are Everton and Manchester City (Arsenal did it for a while). Blackburn and Sheffield Wednesday do it as well, so does Killie in Scotland. You'd want it to be short though and relevant to the borough. Kensington and Chelsea's motto is too wordy, *Quam Bonum In Unum Habitare* (What a good thing it is to dwell together in unity), but the motto for the borough is short enough, *Nisi Dominus Frustra* (Unless god be with us, all will be in vain).

Just my two cents. I like it though, it's clean. Also subbed to your subreddit.

I can get a concealed carry permit when I turn 21. Any son of a bitch who wants to get me will have a 44 magnum down his throat.

Probably a year ago a neighbor of my father  into my father's yard ( he has since been incarcerated for stealing beer if that tells you anything) and was bothering dad and was being aggressive so dad just put his hand into his pocket.

The man, named Dusty, asked him if he was going to shoot him. Dad said not unless you make me, or you don't get out of my yard. 

So Dusty got off my Father's property, and my dad never drew his gun.

My father also likes revolvers because you don't have to fidget with a safety to get it to shoot. The safety IS the hammer, and they're less prone to jam when sand is introduced.

I hope the system has improved greatly since I went through it. But I find it hard to believe the kids have changed much, so whilst you give the top 25% a chance to rise, you're still condemning the majority of children in the middle, who are of average intelligence, to be dragged down by those with serious social problems and no interest in education. For a massive decision to be made on their lives at such a young age seems grossly unfair. 

I knew several kids who grew up in the worst areas of Wycombe, their siblings went to Grammar school but they didn't quiet make the grade so they ended up at secondary modern. They all suffered for it, because there was no chance for them to escape being dragged into the drama going on around them. They all came out worse for their time in education and were left with a serious disadvantage they had to overcome. In spite of that they have eventually gone on to do as well, in some cases better than their grammar school educated siblings. Because these were all perfectly capable children who just didn't quiet make the grade, and ended up being condemned by a system that's meant to be offering them a leg up.

I agree that immediate impact is needed, and that's exactly why I think we need to pursue a left winger that looks the most compatible to our likely system, conducive to our needs, and suitable to the Prem based on previous experience/encounters. Konoplyanka is precisely this, and he is strong defensively as he has the pace to get back and help out his fullback. He also was originally brought to Dnipro as a DLP, so he's familiar with defensive schemes and possesses the situational awareness in the middle and defending third when to identify opponent moves of concern. This coupled with his pace is very beneficial. 

As for cutting Rose simply from this year alone, I think that logic would apply to a sizable chunk of the squad. Very hard to entirely write off any of the players from this season entirely, and especially one we wouldn't be able to sell for much anyway while subsequently providing homegrown count.

*  Interstates that run the length or width of the nation have either a single digit or double digit number to them.
*  You can determine what direction a particular HWY goes by whether it's an odd or even number.  I-95 runs north and south.  I-90 runs east to west.  
*  You will see interstate highways with three digits in them.  If they are an even number then it means that it will take you around the city sort of like the M-25 takes you around London.  If that three digit number is odd then it's more like a spur.  It may take you directly into the city's center and then stop there.
*  Each state numbers the highway exits differently.  I know in New Hampshire the exits are numbered consecutively and have nothing to do with distance.  In California there are no exit numbers (although that's changing).  They just have street names for theirs.  A majority with have them linked to the distance from the border.  Speaking of which if you wanted to know how far you have to go to make it across the state then if your exits start at 244 then you have about 244 miles till you reach the border of the state on that particular highway.
*  Our interstates have at least 2 lanes that are separated by a median at a minimum.  There are some that have 3.  Then when you get towards the city it'll go as high as 8.  
*  If you ever see an oncoming vehicle flashing their lights chances are there's a speed trap ahead.  
*  You can not pump your gas in the states of Oregon and New Jersey.
*  Be sure you have some loose change on you in case you encounter a toll road.

Edinburgh's prices are fairly high and you don't mention a budget.  If you are centrally located business wise, many corps own flats (apartments) in the new town. If you wish to buy or rent a three bedroom here it's going to cost you.

Excllent suburbs in Edinburgh are Corstorphine,  Stockbridge, Morningside, Blackhall, Trinity, Fetes, Merchiston, The Grange, Crammond/Barnton.

Good suburbs are leith links, leith (almost centre), Gilmerton, Liberton.

Avoid Wester Hailes, Parts of Granton, Pilton, The Inch, Craigmillar, Sighthill.

All schools within Edinburgh operate catchment areas so you are not free to pick and choose.  Private nurseries can be extremely expensive, so I'd advise finding a public one for your 3 year old.

Good commuter towns for Edinburgh include  Livingston, Currie, Balerno, parts of Dalkeith, parts of Prestonpans, Cockenzie, Drem, Gullane, North Berwick, East Linton, Dunbar, Haddington (not all have rail links) oh and Sourh Queensferry (this could be ideal for you)

I'm sure others will add to my list however that's something to start with.

Just be aware that prices can be high in the Lothians.  For a city centre place with three bedrooms you probably want a deposit of about £70-100k plus a wage of £50k+ as a minimum.  Rentals vary but get up to about £1000-3000 per month.

I've seen stabbing and there was a case of a drug dealer shooting at the school looking for a kid to a guy who owed him money which was scary.

But all in all I met some of my lifelong friends (Some from primary school) and we still hang out have a few drinks and laugh about the old days still! So its not that bad, even though the school was rough as fuck it still bring fond memories of the friends I had which made it bearable and when we went to play football and stuff.

And I think this is where my key point is, a skill in socialising and dealing with different social groups, my ""Gamer/Geek"" group moulded with the Emo / Metal guys who were really nice so I met a ton of different type of people and learned loads about what they like, stuff that offends them etc, plus our group ended up so big that nobody really started on anyone.
