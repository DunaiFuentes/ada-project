We got a poor decision. *It happens*. Webb didn't have a good match overall. *It happens*. Instead of becoming depressed when we lose, this subreddit has now moved on to becoming conspiratorial and spiteful. 

Why can we not take the loss and move on with our heads high? We played very well away to title contenders, and if anything we we're let down by some uncharacteristically poor finishing. Yet the second most upvoted post on this subreddit is complaining about Webb ""hating"" Liverpool, supported by stats that aren't even accurate! And yet because they fit the narrative this subreddit gobbles them up, with people posting all over about how Webb has an agenda against Suarez or Liverpool. 

This isn't quality discussion, it's simply whining IMO. It's one thing to rue a penalty that isn't given--it's another thing to try and find a pattern in a referee's last 20 games and go on about how we are targeted.

true,Punchingtime,null,null,"I have a couple of different comics, The Prisoners of Time, Doctor Who X Star Trek: The Next Generation: Assimilation^2, and the Doctor Who Classics Omnibus. 


I would recommend the Assimilation^2 if she also like TNG, it's a nice comic with Matt Smith's Doctor in it, and has a pretty decent story. Without spoiling anything, but putting it in a nutshell: The Doctor(with Amy and Rory) and the Enterprise crew vs. Cybermen and Borg.


Prisoners of Time uses the first 11 doctors in the same story. I did love the idea of the mysterious antagonist they used, and everything, but when you have that many of the doctors together, it just kinda seems like a cluster fuck, so it's still a good read, but I don't strongly recommend it as much. 


Then finally the Omnibus, unfortunately I only have Volume 2 and not the first one, but it's not like it's imperative to have as the Omnibus is a collection of older doctor who comics. The stories in this one has the 4th, 5th, and 6th doctors, so no Matt Smith in this one. There are still some very neat stories in this one like The Tides of Times and 4-Dimensional Vistas. Would definitely recommend reading if your sister doesn't mind that there would be no Matt Smith in it.

true,WatermelonFlavored,US,usa,Interesting analysis which is always great to see in this sub but I do not entirely understand why you say in our January transfer window we weakened our defensive depth. In terms of players for position we replaced Essien for Matic. Essien is versatile and can be played at RB at times but we already have two in form RBs. We did buy a very promising and young CB from Saint Ethiene( spelling?) but he's not with the squad till summer. Jose didnt allow Ake or Kalas to leave because we might have injury related problems which was evidenced by JTs recent knock as well as Cahill's. And by selling Mata and KDB I would say we even stronger defensively. Both are amazing players but are most promising in the CAM position which is usually reserved for Oscar. If you watched Arsenal play against Liverpool (The 5-1 loss) you could tell Ozil was a liability because a lot of the counter attacks against the Gooners would start when Ozil lost the ball. With no pace to even help press( which is a arguably only effective if you have all ten players actively trying to win the ball) you can see how as a team that specializes in counter attacking cannot make exceptions for even players of Mata's caliber.,0,1392612056,null,0,false,0,cfh8mi0,t3_1y3cj8,t1_cfh8mi0,t1_cfh0ua6,null,1432430584,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Webb's officiating was terrible, but I don't think it's because he's out to get us but because *he's not a good referee*. Arsenal got a fair share of stupid no-calls as well, including what maybe should've been a second yellow on Gerrard and a penalty against Skrtel. Webb is just not good at his job, and he's especially limp in big games (hello 2010 WC final). But his appearance, his experience as a cop, the awards, FA politics, etc. etc. all means he never really has to answer for any of it.

Bad refereeing is one of those problems- like phantom goals until this past season- where no one really cares until it's *their team* getting screwed.

true,maybelying,null,null,"IMHO, RTD's era was characterized by an emphasis on strong character development often surrounded by weak or campy story lines.

Moffat's era is somewhat opposite, with an emphasis on wild, over-the-top stories and ambitious story arcs at the expense of rather flat characterization.  

I prefer the RTD episodes because I liked the characters well enough to overlook the weak stories.  Even the one-time characters and villains seemed to get more depth in the storytelling rather than just being objects or plot points.  I just never felt emotionally vested in the Moffat characters; the Doctor became some sort of superhero, and the companions were never really fleshed out beyond how their lives were tied to the Doctor.  

I don't dislike the Moffat era, I just prefer RTD's.  Those are the episodes I feel more inclined to watch over and over.  But then, to me, the characters are the real story, and not the situations.  Others will feel differently, and Moffat certainly did try some ambitious things.

To me it's like RTD's Batman to Moffat's Superman.  Everybody loves Superman, but Batman for many is the more intriguing one that they want to watch.  It's easier to relate to flawed characters, even when they have extraordinary abilities.

That's my take anyways.  I just can't reconcile the fact that Moffat wrote some of the most brilliant episodes during the RTD era against how the Eleven era played out for me.",0,1392619967,null,0,false,0,cfhba0k,t3_1y4el1,t1_cfhba0k,t3_1y4el1,null,1432431840,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Everyone is always quick to jump on the Moffat hate bandwagon. A common complaint -- and I'm bringing it up because maybe this is your issue with the Smith series' as well -- is that Moffat episodes have no consequences. ""No one really dies."" That's the big one. 

To that I say, quite simply, death ends things. That's what it does. Death doesn't change you, it changes those who survive your passing. It is in coming close to death and instead living that alters us. In other words, there are far worse things than dying. 

Eleven has dealt with some terrible things. Throughout his lives, the Doctor has tried to save us. He values life. But his Eleventh incarnation found himself turning into a monster. He was hunted by the most horrible things in existence... Things that were *afraid* of him. They built him the perfect prison, but he escaped it. They engineered an assassin to destroy him, and he made her fall in love with him. 

And, for him, that was just another day.

I've seen a lot of complaints about Smith's final episode. People complained about how rushed it felt. How entire plot lines were just wrapped up in a sentence or two. Well, that's how it all must feel to the Doctor. Over a thousand years of fighting and teaching and healing and burning on and on and on alone. While everyone else dies.

&gt;

&gt;Not to be confused with The Night of the Doctor, the 2013 minisode featuring the Eighth Doctor.

&gt;**Night and the Doctor** is a series of five made-for-DVD mini-episodes of Doctor Who which were written by [Steven Moffat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat). They were released as bonus features in the Complete Sixth Series DVD and Blu-ray box sets in November 2011. Four of them are thematically linked and take place in the console room of the TARDIS. They centre on the question, ""What does the Doctor do at night when his companions are asleep?"" The fifth one precedes the events of the episode ""[Closing Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_Time_(Doctor_Who\))"", and does not feature the Doctor or any regular companions.

I don't dislike him like I really disliked 6. (Not the actor, that particular Doctor. Colin is lovely.) He's more like 7 was for me. I just didn't get much into McCoy for some reason, though I know a lot of people just love him. I watched his episodes, once, but I just know I am really not likely to again. 

I'm more likely to watch Smith than McCoy probably but that's more because of his companions than him. That's sad really. That I liked most of his companions better than I actually liked his Doctor or his stories. But that's how it is, if I am honest. He's a pretty good actor, but overall I just didn't like his characterization of the Doctor as much as some,and yes, I did think the writing in his tenure was a bit weak. That's probably part of it. Good actor and some really mediocre scripts, not a great combo. He might have impressed me more if the episodes had. He didn't have as much to work with IMHO as CE or DT. There are a few standout episodes, moments, but not that many, IMHO. I'm hoping that the new Doctor will revive my interest. The past few seasons I have been really bored. I hate that.

I moved on because after numerous extensions, my fixed term appointment expired. Jobcentres are now on the whole seriously understaffed. I still work in benefits, but for a council. I also volunteer to help people with learning difficulties into employment.

The union were pretty great to be honest. They helped us fight our corner and helped to inform us when there were holes in some nasty piece of legislation or other that meant we didn't have to uphold it. 

An example would be Universal Jobmatch - a piece of shite job website which we were initially told would be mandatory for claimants to join. PCS informed us that this was not the case and that Jobseekers were free to use whichever websites they saw fit. This was particularly useful for those looking at industry specific sites.

We weren't told to mislead customers over sharing information over universal jobmatch but I don't find it hard to imagine that others were in other officers. When I lost my contact with the JCP I signed on for a short while before I started in my current job with a Local Authority and I was told I had to use UJ and share my information so in response I gave the PCS guidance about this and told the terrible advisor I had politely to mind her own business.

Targets did exist in a roundabout way. There was a percentage (I forget it now, sorry) of claimants which it was considered normal to be sanctioning. Failing to meet this target could result in consequences both for the individual and the office as a whole. The individual would be put on a PDP (personal development plan - toe the party line or be fired). As an office you could lose out on financial bonuses and funding.

It obviously fails at that but, depending on how the force is structured, can you explain how, after dropping elements of the offence that the UK has that an iScotland wouldn't need, how it couldn't afford to defence it's assets. I mean  the UK can't even afford to provide Maritime Patrol Aircraft for Scottish Waters (any waters actually) so they're hardly holding up their side of the bargain. 

The white paper actually didn't propose leaving NATO, it said the opposite. Pg 250-251 discusses it 
&gt; Scotland would take it's place as one of the many non-nuclear members of NATO

&gt; Membership of NATO will obviously be in the interests of Scotland,the rest of the UK, and other NATO members. Scotland occupies an important place in regional security arrangements that NATO members enjoy. 

&gt; following a YES vote in 2014, the Scottish Government will notify NATO of our intention to join the alliance and will negotiate our transition ... To becoming an independent member of the alliance. 


What happens if the UK shuts down Clyde? You seem to be confusing multiple matters here. They can close HMNB Clyde but that is a base, one which they store nuclear weapons  at. One which isn't readily replaced. One which they'd need to negotiate th continued use of until they have replaced. Moving production of the Type26 is a different matter, and I guess they could insist that BAE move the production to England. That would make the shipyards on the Clyde somewhat redundant, except from in producing the ships that a Scottish Navy might need. I concede that wouldn't be enough to maintain those yards and they might close. 

No one is suggestion forcing Scottish troops be forced out of the British Armed Forces, but switching would present different opportunities, such as being able to more quickly move up through the ranks of he new force. The only opportunities that would chance drastically would be their deployment on combat operations; if that's what they're joining up for, to shoot people, them are they really wanted? Travelling and seeing the world would still be possible in a Scottish Forces as they're likely to be deployed on peacekeeping missions.

- The old sexist culture had religious control over sex. Men are frustrated and consider women as meat but they are not allowed to have sex with gentle women, only with prostitutes/bitches. Those are the people who will rape and justify it by ""she had a skirt"", and it is the culture of victim shaming.

- The new culture is driven by feminism. A large part of sexism died but social norms of flirting did no evolve. This makes some people frustrated. They respect women and refuse to have the old aggressive behaviour. But as they do not succed at non-aggressive flirting because women expect flirting, they become cynical about women and sex. Those men will wear the ""I feel rapy"" shirts and say to their friendly coworker ""You are very rapeable"". And they have the bitch-hate and scumbag-hate mentality, ""women only love assholes"".

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;Insurance is one of the most rational and fair industries out there - it's not nice, and it can really screw some people over, but it's definitely rational.

For a start insurance is a huge industry. You can't lump em all together and make a judgement on the entire industry, it's pointless to this discussion. We are talking specificaly about car insurance here.

&gt;OFT continues to hold the view that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are features of the market that prevent, restrict or distort competition, and has decided that a more in-depth investigation by the CC through a market investigation reference is appropriate.

The Competition Commission are now investigating and they have recently stated:

&gt;Our provisional view is that many drivers of the UK’s 25 million privately registered cars are footing the bill for unnecessary costs incurred during the claims process following an accident. These costs are initially borne by the insurers of at-fault drivers, but they feed through into increased car insurance premiums for all drivers.

Which pretty much reinforces what many of us already knew. The car insurance market is not fair. There are lots of middlemen who are making a huge profit through our misfortune an premiums are hugely distorted. People involved in no-fault claims can see their premiums rise 50-100% quite easily for the individual which isn't at all fair and not indicative of risk whatsoever. If we are dealing with a drunk driver it doesn't matter where you park, they might as well come crashing through your front gates and smash your car on the drive-way.",0,1392629592,null,0,false,0,cfhdd79,t3_1y3odu,t1_cfhdd79,t1_cfh5lfh,null,1432432818,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,iain_1986,null,null,"But the whole point of a No Claims Discount should be that it rewards people who don't make claims. Not people who pay the extra money to protect it. The insurance companies are just making more money by selling another service that shouldn't be needed. They create the concept of no claims....then create the insurance to protect it. You're having to pay more to insure yourself against their own biased system.

Its just another insurance they can make some money out of. Poeple shouldn't be allowed to ""protect"" their no claims. If the whole system is meant to be around probability and various peoples risk factors, allowing people to protect their no claims makes the whole system pointless.

I'd be happy for mine to go up, if there weren't people *causing* accidents, who are ok because they signed up to yet another payment. I mean, the person who crashed into me is fucked because they were drunk and arrested at the scene....but what if it was a regular crash, they had NCD protection, I didn't, I wasn't even ""involved"" but i'm the one punished because I didn't sign up to the insurance companies extra ""protect your NCD policy""....

It should be simple. You cause accidents, your rates go up. VIctims of accidents, remain the same. You move to a high risk area, it goes up. You move to a low risk area it goes down. Someone keys your car, smashes a windscreen, crashes into it because they were too blind drunk...that not your fault, you shouldn't have to pay extra for the next 5 years.

No I am not. I clearly said in my comment ""Wenger's terrible with bringing in youth prospects for the future...Wilshere, Chamberlain, Gnabry, Szczesny, Gibbs, Ramsey....all rubbish. Would much rather have Allen."" These are all current wonderkids.

and ""Mertesacker for 8m, Koscielny for 10m, Sagna for 7m"" which are amazing signings made in the past 6 years. Other signings in the last 8 years include: Chamberlain for 12m, Szczesny for free, Nasri for 15m, Ramsey for 5m, Alex Song for 1m, Adebayor for 4m, Rosicky for 7m and Walcott for 5m.

Far, far better than any signings Liverpool have in recent times bar Suarez.

&gt;Plus our academy players are Gerrard, Flanagan, Kelly, Sterling, Ibe, Texiera
So get your facts right.

Oh yes, amazing players Kelly, Ibe and Texiera are (never heard of them). Gerrard is 33 years old, I thought you had a young manager who brings in youth. All he brings in is Sterling and Flanagan because Johnson is injured. Wenger plays Gibbs, Szczesny, Ramsey and Wilshere in the first team.

Henderson and Allen are terrible and wouldn't even make it into Everton or Spurs' midfield.

&gt;Plus Wilshere is so over-rated it hurts, much rather have Allen over that man with anger problems.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

According to this scouser, Allen &gt; Wilshere. HAHAHAHAHAHA.

You probably didn't even watch Wilshere's performance when he was 18 in the 2010/11 season, when he was man of match against Xavi and Iniesta. You're probably judging Wilshere on 1 or 2 performances when he was playing on the wing.

Wilshere's had 1 red card in his career after a bad tackle. Vieira was far worse, but I bet you'd rather have Allen than Vieira because of that!

true,samceeh,null,null,"There's a whole bunch of reasons for the way our youth system and loaning ideology operates. I think you misunderstand a little about the way loaning works for young players.

Loans did help Rose, Townsend and Walker, absolutely. The most recent ones, that is, all to premier league sides. Walker went on loan three times, Rose's time at Sunderland was his fourth. Townsend went on what, 9? My point is, loans are far from being a sure-fire thing. A lot of things have to go right, and it's essentially a gamble for both clubs- the loaning club hope they've got a player adequate to their level. The loaners hope the player will get the minutes and the exposure he needs, as well as mundane things like settling in the area and amongst new team mates. There is no 'settling in' period like so many players need at new clubs- the young loanee has to be good from the get go, otherwise he might not get to start again for a long time. Which is a complete waste of precious development time and money. 

Injuries are a big deal as well, when you consider the top class facilities and personnel Spurs have compared to the club we're loaning to. If a player gets a bad injury, do you recall him so you can supervise his recovery? Or do you risk him in the hopes that when he recovers he gets back in the team? Consider Harry Kane's loan to Norwich. 

For those three loans- Walker at Villa, Rose at Sunderland and Townsend at QPR- there were plenty more that never worked out. 

My next point- why should a club develop a player for us? Because that's what they're doing, and they're often paying us for the privilege. Top clubs, and by that I mean anyone from the middle of the championship up to the middle of the prem, have their own youngsters with an eye on becoming stars. Why are ours any better? Especially the ones who haven't played outside tottenham's u21 team yet. Loaning clubs need to be convinced the kid is going to have a good season without counting on 'potential'. Saying "" he's going to be good, you just know it"" isn't going to be enough to sway a manager who's really only looking for a squad player. Which is why I'd mention age during breakout seasons- Rose (22), Walker (21?) and Townsend (21). All three were further along in their development and had played for the first XI before that particular loan spell. Which means when a manager asked, Spurs could point to it and say- yo, he's played for a top side before. 

*TL;DR Loans are tough to get right*

Is it fair that I caused a crash and don't have my premium increased but you do? Maybe not but then I looked at the rules of the insurance game and decided the risk. Is fair that the ‘£15k’ damage I caused was simply a 15mph bumper damage to the car infront after he had braked suddenly and then claimed he was injured? No not really.



There are three things that may happen to change insurance 


1)	Mandatory 3rd party insurance, when you pay your VED (tax) you pay a fixed amount more and get third party insurance for any car, this would then make any other insurance voluntary so the insurance companies would actually have run their businesses like they are in a competitive market rather than the situation now where you only have a handful of insurance underwriters who don’t give shit because they know every car and every driver legally has to get insurance

2)	GPS tracking app on your phone. Get huge discounts by agreeing that you will install gps tracking apps on your phone, then the insurance companies can actually judge you by your driving metrics (amount you drive, time you drive, where you drive, speed, acceleration, braking aggressiveness, how smooth you are at changing lanes etc)

3)	Long term self driving cars will make the roads safer and change the insurance paradigm,

_________________________________________

Large databases comprising linked clinical information are not new or uncommon. Many are already in existence, including the Doctors' Independent Network (DIN) database and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The latter contains information on over 20 million people, including consultation, prescription and lab result data, with linkage to common disease registers. Aside from such cohorts, health information is routinely reported in public-access publications such as Hospital Episode Statistics, which contain over 125 million individual inpatient, outpatient, and A&amp;E records per year. Even census data is used for research purposes as part of the ONS Longitudinal Study, which contains more than 500,000 individual census records, with data linked to disease and mortality registers.

As an epidemiologist, these resources are of massive value for exploring disease management and the effectiveness of services.

In my experience, these data are managed very stringently indeed:

* Lots of paperwork is required in order to gain access, outlining a priori precisely what data are required, how you intend to use it and who will have access to it. 
* In many cases, data are accessed and analysed via a data enclave (a single PC without network access or removable storage). 
* You have to pre-specify the sorts of variables required. Thus, when logging into the enclave, you have access to a restricted dataset containing only the specific variables required.
*  In the case of tabulated data, cell thresholds are specified; in order words, you are not allowed to print and remove any table within which a single cell contains fewer than a pre-specified number of cases. This limits the identifiability of pseudonymised data. 
* Any publications or reports resulting from your analysis have to be submitted and examined by a board of data managers prior to release.
* Data usage needs to be in the patient interest; access for insurance or marketing purposes is forbidden. 

The [overwhelming majority of applications are from universities and hospital trusts for research in the interest of patients](http://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-the-hra/our-committees/section-251/cag-advice-and-approval-decisions/). Despite clinical datasets already being available, information governance procedures suggest that data are being adequately safeguarded agaisnt exploitation by unscrupulous companies. 

Given the Health and Social Care Information Centre's (HSCIC) long-running experience of managing sensitive datasets, I have every confidence in the *care.data* project.

I cram myself into a commuter train into London most days, and have done for years so I know the issue first hand. There is no evidence the rail services being nationalised would change anything. Government is intrinsically bad at running things. Although if it's going to reduce my yearly ticket by say 50% then I'm on board. It's about time the middle got something decent back for taxes. Would that happen? Of course not. 

You get a very good service on the main commuter lines into London. I can literally count on my hands the number of serious delays in the past 12 months (say, anything above 5 mins - that's not the recent flooding though!). My ticket is expensive but my housing is cheap as it's not in London. It's a tradeoff.

I was young with BR was around - but from everyone I know who did use it regularly (grew up in commuter-land) the opinion was that trains were extremely unreliable and driving was easier.

I think a lot of the problem stems from the ridiculous way in which they are privatised, neither owning the rolling stock, the lines etc.

As your article points out, season tickets are actually cheaper now or hover around the same as inflation (amazingly) - and the problem seems to stem from singles. You can easily solve this by buying ahead of time for extremely cheap journeys.

It's not just rail travel though - loads of things have increased by waaay more than inflation in 20 years. 

So yeah, unreliable, dirty, useless services of BR versus marginally more expensive but clean, reliable and useful privatised services? I know what this commuter wants.

I'll bet our current trains are faster, more reliable, less polluting and cheaper than the first British steam trains, doesn't mean I should be happy about it. It's been over 15 years since BR was dismantled! Things are supposed to get better, much better, over 15 years, not stay the same.

Why are our tickets getting more expensive (much faster than any measure of inflation) if trains aren't getting faster or bigger or more comfortable (at least, I've not seen any evidence of this since I started using trains 10 years ago)? Why does it seem like other developed countries have train services so much better than ours?

Air travel, even when so heavily affected by rising fuel costs and weather, keeps getting more and more cheap, more frequent, more quick and more reliable. Plenty of people have pointed out that it is sometimes actually cheaper and faster to get a bus to the airport, take a plane and get another bus at your destination, that to take a train.

So what the hell has been going on the last 15 years?

true,ggow,null,null,"That's not exactly how it works. Scotland's deficit is smaller than the UK average. Assuming that Scotland takes a population share of the debt when it leaves (as opposed to the proposed historically calculated version) that means that Scotland will take on debt that was accrued for rUK. Scotland has ran a smaller deficit than the UK average for 27 of the past 30 years so, therefore, it's not incorrect to say Scotland would have subsidised the rest of the UK. 

Assuming Scotland remains within the UK, and the debt is paid down, and the lower-deficit situation persits, then Scotland will make more contributions to paying it off and could therefore be said to have subsidised the UK. 

Adding to that, as Scotland would have had lower debt anyway, it's debt-managing costs would have been substantially lower than the UK's are. Various other similar factors, such as funding trident (as an example, which I admit you could quibble about) would mean Scotland's deficit was even lower. 

Basically, I don't think it's wrong to say there's been subsidising going on. Bankrolling is maybe excessive, except from perhaps the 80s. (You remember all the articles posted from the guardian a while back about how the North Sea bank rolled her policies and unemplyoment etc.?)

TL;DR Bankrolling is excessive but it's not inaccurate to say that Scotland is on the hook for debt that wasn't accrued to be spent in Scotland i.e. it subsidised rUK. Not only that, but Scotland's 'living costs' were higher than would have been the case if she were Independent, compounding the negative financials of being in the Union.

To be fair youth development is a gamble overall for every team, just look at our team....for every Andros/Rose/Walker/Caulker there is a Bostock, Parrett, Byrne, Dawkins, Obika, Nicholson, Alnwick who just don't pan out.

However the loan system is a very good way to identify if a player has what it takes or not by putting them against higher competition than they get at the U-21/18/NextGen sides. 

But there can be some tough decisions when trying to find a place to player on loan.  Bentaleb for example is clearly talented enough to play at the PL level but at 19 years old and still physically developing fi we had looked to put him on loan we would probably looked to send him to League 1, but at League 1 would he have challenged enough to develop? Putting him in the PL may be too much a physical challenge for him to get enough experience (Bentaleb seems to be doing fine in this aspect)....Tom Carroll is another example, seems to have the talent to play at PL level yet you still hear QPR fans mention how he is getting physically knocked about at the Championship and how he can struggle against the men. A player like Adam Smith seemed to have been on track to reach our first team but a lackluster loan followed by an injury this season resulted in us feeling like we could offload him.

Then you have the loans like Tomislav Gomelt or Coulibaly last season that seemed to at least be partially driven by issues settling in the UK (Gomelt got to Spain and disappeared with talk of homesickness and work permit problems and i still haven't heard a word about him from Antwerp this season.). A loan like Falque that is seemingly getting him acclimated to La Liga (where i think he will ultimately end up), or Ceballos to Portuagal where we may be testing him in a style of play that is an easier for him to acclimate to than in England.

There is quite a bit that goes on behind the scenes at the club with the youngsters and that go into loan decisions. Really it is as you said it is a bit of a gamble, youth player in general are a gamble which is why you see teams bring in any number of youth players in hopes that one turns into something.  Its why we signed Coulibaly and now Yahaya and why we were chasing Halliovic, Parzyszek, Berisha and Pasalic.

I went to a screening in Glasgow and the SNP were handing out leaflets. During the film, every English death was greeted with a huge cheer.""”

“Braveheart was ... florid and debased ... positing the Scot as the noble and tormented victim of an epicene yet sadistic race ... perhaps, the high point for nationalists.”

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; Tourism revenue is not only irrelevant to a debate about our constitution, the suggestion that the monarchy promotes tourism is also untrue. There is not a single shred of evidence to back this up. Of the top 20 tourist attractions in the UK only one royal residence makes it: Windsor Castle at number 17 (beaten comfortably by Windsor Legoland, in at number 7). Royal residences account for less than 1% of total tourist revenue. Indeed, the success of the Tower of London (number 6 in the list) suggests that tourism would benefit if Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle were vacated by the Windsor family.
&gt; 
&gt; The British tourist industry is successful and robust - castles and palaces would remain a part of our heritage regardless of whether or not we have a monarchy (look at Versaille). Other attractions, such as the London Eye, Trafalgar Square, the west end, Bath, Stonehenge, Britain's beautiful countryside and so on, will continue to attract tourists in the same numbers as they do today. The government body responsible for tourism, Visit Britain, hasn't even collated statistics on the monarchy as an attraction, which shows it is not a key factor in the promotion of the UK as a tourist destination.
&gt; 
&gt; The tourism argument has been dreamt up to distract people from the real issues. There is no evidence that the monarchy is good for tourism, in fact, there are good reasons why the opposite might be true. Imagine the potential for Buckingham Palace if it was fully opened up to tourists all year round, where visitors can explore every room and courtyard and see the grounds and the magnificent art collection. And of course popular ceremonies such as the changing of the guard will continue.

Since you're from abroad, I should add that CrossCountry and First Great Western are two of many different private train operators in the UK. You will see that each train has the company branding on them. While they are supposed to ""compete"", the reality is that depending where you want to go from A to B, you pretty much *must* go with a specific company because they each ""own"" specific routes.

For example, going from Oxford to Manchester direct is always going to be with CrossCountry. Going from Didcot Parkway to Bristol direct is always going to be First Great Western.

Nationalrail.co.uk will tell you which company your route will use (click the details) and how much it will cost, and then you can purchase directly from that company if you wish. They will have the exact same routes, timetable and ticket prices on every company's website, so you don't need to worry about ""shopping around"" for the cheapest one.

BTW,  [Red spotted hanky](http://www.redspottedhanky.com/en-gb/) is a site I have heard about geared towards visitors to the UK. It may be useful to you. It is very similar to nationalrail.co.uk

That said, there are ways to reduce the total price of your train journeys:

You can choose a different, perhaps less direct route. Personally, I think I would rather just get to my destination as fast as possible and with as few changes as possible and pay accordingly. For you though, since you are looking around the UK, you may find it a good idea to take a less direct route and see some sites that you otherwise would just pass by.

Pre-booking [***advance*** tickets](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types/46583.aspx) (especially long distance ones) will be *considerably* cheaper if you book far in advance, like a month if possible, although this will be a specific train at a specific time with very little flexibility. There are only a limited number of them, so you must buy early to take advantage. Note that these are one-way tickets, so you will need to buy your return ticket separately. They are non-refundable and it costs quite a lot to amend them, so you should be very sure of your travel time when using these.

Otherwise, you can get [***off-peak*** tickets](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types/46590.aspx) which are more expensive but they included both outgoing and return journeys and afford much greater flexibility. You can also buy them on the day at the station. Outgoing journey must be on the day advertised, but return journey can be anytime, any off-peak train within a month. These tickets also allow **break of journey** which means you can get off the train anywhere along the route, look around and get back on the any train continuing to your destination, great for tourists. Be sure to check the T&amp;Cs regarding off-peak validity and break of journey though. Off-peak normally means avoiding the morning commuter rush on weekdays, especially around London. Weekends are always off-peak. Avoid non-off-peak tickets and trains because they are incredibly expensive and very full.

Finally, if you're under 26, you should check out the **[Railcard](http://www.railcard.co.uk/)** which can save you a huge amount of money on train tickets. It costs money, but you can make all that back in savings from a single long distance journey. You can buy one at any station when you get here.

Sorry this got a bit complicated, but our system is rather complicated. If you're going to be travelling to many places and there will be a few people travelling together, it may be simpler/easier to just get a car :)

Also, as an EU traveller, you should be aware of the **[InterRail train pass](http://www.interrail.eu/interrail-passes/one-country-pass/great-britain)** which allows you to pay for a single ticket for unlimited travel within a specified time period. That may be more economical if you are taking many trains.

But if you put a young player down too far where the physicality isn't as much of an issue then their talent tends to be much higher than those surrounding them which causes its own issues.

As for Smith, i was pretty sure he wouldn't overtake Walker but it looked like he was on his way to overtaking Naughts in my opinion.  Actually i think his loan at Mlillwall was pretty decent from what i have picked up, nothing amazing but enough to show he could cut it game in and game out. His loan to Derby this season apparently went completely awry, he was by most accounts fairly mediocre and then he got hurt and then replaced by Andre Wisdom which is when we pulled him back.  

When he got back Fredericks had apparently pieced something together (going into this season he seems to have been regarded as a middle of the road wing prospect that seemed destined to follow Dawkins career path, but the move to RB seems to have helped him sort things out) and he jumped Smith.  I still think that Smith can be a solid player (maybe nothing truly special but someone who could have a ""solid"" career.) down the line but would have never displaced Walker or Rose so a sale was best for all parties.

true,syan23,null,null,"this is pretty much the answer. The seat of sovereignty for the UK is within London, Scotland breaking off doesn't change that. All the agreements the UK has currently in place, both internationally and domestically will still be in effect because the standing government is sworn to undertake a continuation of governance. Scotland however (whilst it has a holyrod) will be required to form it's own constitution and seperation of powers which will dictate the roles of each branch of their newly formed government.

Although another way to think of it is like this. If a company with 100 people has a 10 man team break away to form their own company, would the original companies contracts be void because they lost those staff even if those staff members were a factor in aforementioned contracts (scotland is roughly 10% economically/population). The answer is obviously no, and the new company the breakaway staff set up would have to negotiate with all interested parties under there own terms and relative capabilities and conditions, regardless of their previous standing and experience with the same parties. 

I think thats the answer to the question you were getting at, i.e. why isn't england/wales/ni being made to rejoin all these things because the UK *is* being broken up and so the 'pieces' will be different to the whole.

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. 

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't. So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the second time attempted the step, and, once again, much to her dismay, she could not raise her leg. 

With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind a third time to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step. About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. 

She went ballistic and turned to the would be Samaritan and yelled, ""How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!"" The Texan smiled and drawled, ""Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we was friends!""

You misunderstand. If someone with protected NCD makes a claim their insurance will go up the following year as a result but they'll get the discount still.

Example:

A policy prior to NCD being applied is £1000. Someone with no NCD pays £1,000 and someone with 60% NCD pays £400. 

So say they make a claim and the policy renewal after a claim is £1500.

Person without NCD or NCD protection will pay £1500. Person with protected NCD has their NCD maintained so will get a 60% discount and will pay £600. In both cases the insurance has risen 50% as a result of the claim. 

The point is that protected NCD doesn't stop your insurance going up, it just maintains the percentage discount you get.

Well, I can't help you find a mortgage with no early repayment fees, but I can advise you chat with an independant mortgage advisor - most estate agents have a tame one they associate with.

We're buying at the moment - in that annoying bit between exchange and completion - and the cost of this advisor to us will be £250, payable  upon completion of the purchase, so nothing at all for all the advice before then even if it falls through right at the last minute. He will then offer us support and advice with the mortgage for the life of the product. Apart from that fee, he makes most of his money from the lender we eventually went with, as he's selling their product for them.

Access to health data has long been restricted to research explicitly in the interest of patient or a response to national emergencies. The identification of individuals would therefore constitute a breach of the Data Protection Act. Exact responses would be determined on a case-by-case basis, according to the type and scale of breach as well as the damage caused, as with any government data.

That linked clinical datasets comprising millions of UK citizens have been in existence for decades without exploitation^1 suggests that either (a) existing safeguards are sufficiently robust for pseudonymised^2 data, (b) the incentive or demand for the abuse of pseudonymised datasets is minimal, or (c) pseudonymised data are regularly exploited but data managers never find out. Given the duration for which safeguards have been in place, I am inclined to think that (c) is unlikely. 

In my view, the most robust system for pseudonymised would be a data enclave. Some are so strict that analyses are undertaken by data management staff only, such that applicants only ever get to see printed results tables; they never get access to the dataset proper, restricted or otherwise. Unfortunately the literature on care.data is such that I'm still on whether an enclave would be used. Given the administrative costs applied to data access, I would like to think that an enclave would be the default for pseudonymised data of this kind.

&gt;What happens if, once online, and once no one is able to opt out any more?

Research ethics are strict about ensuring that participants are freely able to withdraw at any stage and have their data removed in its entirety. Do you know of any documentation where this would be prohibited by *care.data*?

I grew up in a very working class area and the ignorance and misinformation here is rife.  Even the overall population has been shown to have a very skewed idea of the effects of such policies.  No surprise when you see the utter bombardment of sensationalised single case stories in the media.  The odd paedophile re-offender, immigrant rapist, benefit ""scrounger"" or anything else that is ""all that is wrong with this great country"".  This is all without a general idea of numbers or bigger picture.  Now expose this to a significant portion of the population who are largely uneducated, who are conditioned to not actually care about what things are like outside of their own community, and this stuff begins to stick.  

I am by no means insulting the working class, I am ashamed to say that growing up I used to believe that it was immigrants ruining the country, that people here were here entirely by their own fault, and that everyone's taxes were going in to the pockets of the ""scroungers"" down the road.  It was only when I was exposed to the outside world that I began to gain a sense of perspective.  In fact, I think that is entirely what a Labour opposition should focus on; perspective.  A true party of the working classes should be attempting to give perspective, to present the actual numbers on benefit fraud, net immigration and crime.  They should be instilling a grasp of statistics and facts, not spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt through the use of single-case anecdotes.  Cut the rhetoric and actually show people that they have been manipulated by the ruling classes.  Nothing pains me more than seeing the working class being tricked in to shitting on those below them rather than see the shit that is coming from above.

This is not to say that people who believe in tighter immigration or cutting benefits are wrong.  I would just like to see people, at least in my local area, make informed decisions for themselves on such matters.  For example, I do not wish to insult the well read kippers on here.  I am sure that many of them have come to their political alignment through their own research.

Gibbs has played 22 times this season? He's been immense, very, very solid. Far better prospect than Flanagan.

&gt;Ramsey is always injured and will never get a good run of games.

Yet he's been one of the best players in the world this season, and he's 23. How can you even compare the liabilty's of Allen and Henderson to this guy?

Ramsey played about 5 months straight with no break and scored 11 goals from midfield. According to you he is not a wonderkid because he broke his leg 3 years ago and is currently injured. Apart from those two incidences he's never actually gotten injured mate. You could say the same about Bale and Neymar because they are consistently injured.

&gt;Szczesny HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Bless. In the words of you, ""take a look at the stats"". Szczesny has the most clean sheets, and one of the best shot to save ratio's and shot to goal ratio's.

&gt;Wilshre PFFFFTTTTTTTTTT can't defend, can't shoot misplaces so many passes.

Wilshere* Henderson is one of the worst midfielders I've ever seen. He is awful at attempting a half-difficult ball and is awful technically. The only thing he can do is run around a lot and put in a good work rate, whilst playing easy balls from fullback to fullback.

&gt;misplaces so many passes.

This is not *entirely* accurate. As stated, including in the footnote to my previous response, identifiable data are already being routinely uploaded to the HSCIC for many tens of millions of UK citizens. The pseudonymised data to which you can request access has these identifiers stripped out and replaced by useful but higher level data that limits identifiability: postcodes will typically be replaced by regions and dates of birth with age in years, for example. Identifiers can only be accessed in national emergencies or, potentially, by hackers (assuming identifiers are stored on a networked PC). Additionally, for sensitive datasets where enclaves are used, cell thresholds are applied to any tabulated results, further limiting identifiability.

While I'm not saying exploitation is not possible, it is improbable. Why, if data on millions of patients have long been available, have abuses of health data not been common?

I just meant in my initial reply to you that people complaining about gaining entry to the private sub are probably reducing their own chances. The sub does regularly-ish invite people. Admittedly less spontaneously after the Rafa post because less members post here regularly. But when the members recognise a reasonable bloke who reasons his opinions rather than just treating reddit like a place to vacate his bowels then it shows over time and our sub members respect that, particularly those who argue their case well with reasons and facts (I mean ffs we've seen people post in this sub using other posts as evidence and when argued against with statistics or other facts have edited their previous posts to some how perpetrate the notion that they were right all along. Using RES it's easy to tag and avoid arguing with these people) whereas their opposition does not. Those sorts of mindless ""shitposts"" are something that collectively the sub hates and often links to in any football sub as other members might like to chime in or simply have a giggle. As far as that goes, it is in a respect elitist. Albeit in a form that is generally socially acceptable, mocking people for holding opinions you consider outdated or ignorant. I guess similar to lets all have a laugh at creationists trying to argue evolution is stupid recently on Reddit. 

Also worth noting that this respect is generally regardless of whether individuals in the sub agree with his argument or not; it's about being reasoned and providing evidence. 

In some cases these arguments may come from a position of ignorance and many members of either this main sub or cfcuk will try and provide their evidence or essentially try and enlighten the opposition. Too frequently the opposition will remain headstrong and generally purposefully ignore the points made against them without an effective counter argument. It's these sorts of discussions that leave us tearing our hair out and something that never happens in the smaller sub. To this end many of us simply do not bother with the reasons in main subs (/r/soccer included) and either decide to be sarcastic hoping that other people will get the joke; or simply laugh at the fact that everyone goes along with the sarcasm with intentional ignorance (it's more a laugh of despair than anything else). Sometimes people spot the sarcasm, sometimes people get called out on saying something deliberately stupid a la JoMo; and that's a good thing. It's not really meant to be messing with people as such (in the way that it's not a personal slight) but a slight on hivemind and swaying of vast numbers of people in subreddits. People should be thinking independently, and personally I though MD would get crucified out in the main sub. It worried me a lot that he didn't. Bearing in mind there wasn't a lot of pro-rafa stuff around aside from media outlets thinking fans were being unreasonable (I empathise with the media for that, it's a job. But simply enough; there are ways of doing a job without being a cunt). 

The private element of our sub prevents that happening because people invited are only those who have already proven themselves to be reasoned in arguments. When arguments do occur; both sides provide what they are basing their opinions on and why they believe it. If neither persuades the other it simply continues with a greater empathy for each position from each participant. I recently discussed the Courtois position with /u/RGD365 rather than in the main sub because I didn't want to deal with the baseless people. He didn't change his position and to be honest, I didn't really take up much of one other than presenting both sides of the argument.

I think it would be near impossible and extremely unpopular for the British armed forces to be picked apart like it has been suggested.  But of course the SNP are in complete denial regarding this.

The proposed outline for an Independent Scotland's defence is extremely problematic. It is not as simple as 'inheriting' military equipment either. All of the military assets in Scotland legally belong to the UK and with an overstretched military and continuing defence budget cuts, it is very unlikely that the UK will give away equipment as easily as the SNP are imagining. There proposed budget seems to be short of the mark too. It would be very difficult to accommodate the envisioned defence forces with a £2.5 billion budget, especially if they want new frigates and conventional submarines. 

From what I have read I actually believe that, on independence, Scotland would have an extremely difficult time in trying to remove Trident which means that it may not actually be removed at all. The removal of Trident is not as black and white as many have made out.      There are no suitable places for it to go in the rUK that would satisfy safety requirements. On top of that, the moving of Trident would be a great stress put upon the rUK taxpayer and could take up to twenty years to complete. This too would put great stress on Scotland's relationship with NATO, which is a nuclear alliance. I doubt members of NATO would take kindly to a member (or potential member) essentially causing a nuclear disarmament of another. 

And then there's the problem of an intelligence service, and who knows whether that is covered in the proposed £2.5 billion budget!

I think you've completely hit the nail on the head by saying the White Paper only sets out policy objectives!

Labour have opposed almost all those things. Objection to GP-market NHS reforms, ATOS' disability review system, and the bedroom tax have all been at the centre of their platform. 



The only difference I can see are:

* They supported prescription charges (of course they don't apply to elderly or poor people in England and Wales).

* They supported Tuition Fees, although Labour's initial system was entirely different from that proposed by the coalition. UK university funding per student during the 90s was almost half what it was at the start of the 80s, and staff:student ratios had also halved. Taking tuition fees to increase funding, and provide students with a good education, was a good idea. I've no idea how Scotland solved this problem- if they opposed Labour's tuition fees, they must have either introduced cuts elsewhere to shift money towards university funding, or kept funding per student at a low level. Maybe you could provide the answer? The coalition reforms, by contrast, took money from students at the same time as introducing cuts to education spending, so it was effectively a transfer from student to taxpayer.

In any case, this doesn't affect the fundamental point, which is that Labour object when they are in opposition, they never have the opportunity to be simultaneously in that position, and in a position to immediately reverse the reforms.

&gt;20. The UK Government notes the Committee’s remarks relating to security and intelligence. The report highlights uncertainties relating to the future intelligence and security capabilities of an independent Scotland, and the dependence that an independent Scotland would still have on RUK. Although it is likely that Scottish and RUK interests would largely coincide in this area, the report notes that Scotland would lose access to the many benefits that it currently derives from being part of the UK.
21. The UK Government also agrees with the Committee’s view that future RUK help could not be taken for granted as this would be discretionary and based on self-interest. While an independent Scottish state might seek to emulate the status quo by establishing similar cooperative security and defence arrangements to those currently in place, from the UK’s perspective the capability and credibility of the new state would be unproven. It may therefore prove challenging for a newly-independent Scottish state to establish new relationships and partnerships, with allies and it may require significant time, resource and investment to seek to reproduce the benefits it currently enjoys as part of the UK.

There are many motivations for this: Profits being one, designed to be built cheaply. Another is that if I designed a washing machine that actually could last 20 years or more, then well I wouldn't be in business very long. So companies design things purposefully to breakdown within a year or two, simply so you buy another one which increases profits. 
Which I don't need to say, or perhaps I do that this is an entirely un-sustainable business model, which most if not all production companies adhere to.

I've just taken some time out to flick through the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). It looks as though the opt-out applies only to identifiers of GP-extracted data -- i.e. the extension that care.data constitutes over existing HES data processes. Thus, GP information on prescriptions and illnesses would still be uploaded, minus identifiers, while records from hospital visits, prescriptions, etc, would continue to be uploaded as normal. Unfortunately, I still can't see any mention made of what happens to any uploaded identifiers following any future opt-out.

These nuances and a historic lack of clarity concerning health data more generally are definite areas for improvement. The government has been consistently poor when it comes to public communication and I'd agree with the comments made above: communication concerning care.data has been pretty poor to date, and it's pretty poor that individuals have to go out of their way to track down and read long documents like the PIA in order to get a fuller (if still limited) picture. People may be misinformed, as I was up until now, that opting-out would see the omission of all linked clinical data.

Aside from the issue of communication, on which we can definitely agree, I am less sceptical of the care.data project as a system ripe for a sudden onset of abuse despite existing safeguards, such as the claims made by some that sensitive information would now be commercialised and sold to insurance companies, or that police shall be given unfettered ad hoc access.",0,1392648513,null,0,1392648908,0,cfhgzb6,t3_1y3kx9,t1_cfhgzb6,t1_cfhg8hm,null,1432434588,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;These nuances and a historic lack of clarity concerning health data more generally are definite areas for improvement. 

Well, I absolutely agree. I think until such time as they are improved going ahead with care.data would be a bad idea.

&gt;People may be misinformed, as I was up until now, that opting-out would see the omission of all linked clinical data.

People are being misinformed and while there is data that they have been unable to opt out of up till now it seems silly to NOT opt out of this data when we know so little about what will happen or if it can be reversed. 

It seems to me that the correct thing for everyone to do is to opt out now. Even better would be to put a hold on all movement to bring care.data online. Best to straighten all the issues out first.

The problem is about whether people can get their data removed if they miss the deadline in March, which I would argue a majority of people know nothing about. If they opt out now they can always opt in later.

I think you will agree the following:

-Everyone opt out now, research the information, and if they agree then they will put in the time and effort to opt in.

Alternatively:

-Put a halt to care.data until all the major problems and potential for disaster can be reassessed and the project re-launched in an effective, competent, less shady-appearing manner.

The only mortgage that I noticed had no fee (beyond a minor 'finishing the mortgage paperwork fee' on some) were the Standard Variable Rate mortgages.

A 'Current Account Mortgage' wouldn't normally have early repayment fees; by their nature, they are designed for people who expect extra income (possibly unevenly distributed)


However, the thing to keep note of is that most of the shorter term 'good rate' mortgages that have early repayment fees last for only a fraction of the overal duration (2 or 5 years is common), after which they revert to a SVR mortgage.

When I took out mine, I went with a Fixed rate, as an increase in interest rates early on could have been problematic [0].  I then saved a bit extra, and once the fixed term expired, I put it all into the mortgage at that point (on SVR, not incurring any early repayment fees), and then looked around for the best deal at that point.

It's a trade off, between the extra interest paid on the mortgage vs gained in savings, compared to the repayment fees.

It kinda depends if you expect to repay the whole lot very early; somewhat early, or just want to be able to pile a bit more cash at it.  

Even when I was on the 'fixed' portion, I was able to overpay a small amount, which all helps with the compound interest.  Saving the rest gave me a small block of capital, which was handy when the boiler crapped out, for example.

Not all banks will charge you 'early repayment fees' if you change the _term_ of the mortgage; so if you're expecting a salery increase, you might be better thinking of starting with a (say) 25 year mortgage, and lowering that by a year or so, each time you get a pay rise.  Works out pretty similar, but no fees incurred.  

I guess, in summary, I'd say you need to have a clear idea of what you expect to do, how it relates to the available 'extra' money; and how the charges might change over time.  You might find that the best solution might actually be one that declares 'early repayment' fees.",0,1392649204,null,0,false,0,cfhh76k,t3_1y53qs,t1_cfhh76k,t3_1y53qs,null,1432434691,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Firstly I'll address the community between close friends comparison. You don't have to be a friend of anyone to join. It isn't a country club or golf course. The reasons for such an allegory is simple:

* the community of the sub is small enough for everyone to generally know each other or of each other
* Everyone tries to be respectful of each other
* It can be a place to vent about frustrations that you wouldn't really do in public (yes occasionally actually complaining about ""shitposts (1)""
* Friendly banter is encouraged (Which in regular and obvious british tradition: involves calling everybody a cunt in a jovial and affectionate manner.)
* When you are invited it's because other people in the sub have seen you as a reasonable poster in the main sub, you don't have to agree with everything and there aren't set stances on any issues (apart from the hate of Rafa thing).
* We don't just talk about football. I've had discussions with MD about our military. Had discussions about politics and a lot about football finances.
* FFP is a highly interesting topic with the shadyness of football chairmen. Discussing RM finances and the new sheet on the bernabeu that is almost certainly just a massive exercise in FFP. We will pretty much talk about anything anyone wants to talk about. When you're an approved submitter we're interested in you. 
* When we talk about football: We discuss tactics occasionally. And evaluate players on their respective merits. It's not always about Chelsea. Not everyone lives in England so there can be discussions about other leagues and teams. Although obviously Chelsea is the thing we all share so we talk about Chelsea news and so on. Updates on loans and youth can happen fairly regularly as will talking about other prospects around the world.
* We discuss the state of the squad. The obvious replacements as well as qualities we lack specifically, like a passer from deeper. The issues with playing high diagonal balls to short people was something we talked about in the first week of the season then Mourinho brought it up in a Press Conference a few weeks later. Also we talk about how our squad is registered for the CL who occupies what places. Who we can have in the CG places and HG places. Generally other discussions you might consider rather detail heavy compared to here.
* All posts are self posts and there is no ability to link directly to images (text posts only, if you want to link to something as part of your discussion you can do it in the piece itself.


As for the idea that it's like this sub:

* When we argue, we don't downvote, well I don't recall any.
* When you're arguing it's important to be able to empathise with another point of view. Generally speaking arguments don't even have to happen when someone can automatically understand why someone else holds that viewpoint. You can decide to portray your case against them but, generally speaking, the knowledge of people in the sub is so high that much of it isn't news. It can be more of a discussion in the sense that it's a pooling of knowledge than a taking sides.  
* No images; no instagram stuff or videos.
* We will react to a lot of the stuff posted here or anywhere else for that matter. If a topic is posted here that seems interesting or alternatively really outlandish to anybody they might repost the highlight (comedically speaking) of that discussion. And we may then have the discussion ourselves. Although this may stop soon as we may just aim to be a separate sub. SG addressed this with us because of the way that we'd link to something that we'd find comedic or moronic and downvote it because that's what we'd be shown and we wouldn't have been through all of the other parts of the thread to read that. (This is the root cause of the downvote swing that other people have criticised us for, it isn't usually more than a few votes but as a few people are always on given to the fact that we have members on every continent, we can be the ones to start a downvote swing that quickly becomes accelerated. Basically SG would prefer us not to be the cause of any of the swings saying that it's not as though its a hey could you downvote this guy because I don't like him or his opinion). Speaking for myself, I generally don't downvote something that's already negative or relatively highly negative. This sub is supposed to be big enough to decide for itself properly even if sometimes it doesn't seem like that.

You weren't replying to ""50,000 my arse"" with figures from the BBC? I thought that those figures represented very well the charge that the BBC is biased, because it illustrates how they can't win. One side will *insist* that they're under-reporting the figures because of being squeezed by the government, whereas the other side...well, you get the idea.

&gt;They decided not to film the protest on the advice of the private security guards present.

There is the issue that people are well aware of the nasty cuts and how they bite, but they are also well aware that this has come about because of the disaster that our ex-PM encouraged with his financial wizardry - so most have been expecting cuts, but in the larger game that doesn't translate into action against them without some realistic alternatives (Labour for a long time were reduced to '....well it won't work!'). As others have pointed out in this thread, it's no good simply saying 'look at the damage these cuts have done' and hand-wringing a lot - you have to provide an alternative, workable proposal, otherwise you run the risk of being labelled a NIMBY. Not that this stops what seems like half the commentators in r/UK reducing everything to 'well, if we weren't a capitalist society...'.

&gt;I believe that the sight of such a large peaceful protest made up of people from the length and breadth of the UK would have had some impact if it had been given exposure.

And yet, in this sub at least, there are more than enough people who will quite happily insist that the Royals are in no way popular and generate almost none of our tourism/ income....despite street parties/ huge turnouts for the Jubilee *and* Wedding *and* Baby etc. in recent years, images for which were on the TV for *days*...where were all these people that (despite all that) 'know better'? Did they simply not go outside or turn on the TV? I'm not using this example to push the Royals, more giving an example of how far people will go to deceive themselves in persevering with their world view, even when the majority of evidence is against them.

No, what I meant by ""capital goods and the pricing system"" is privately owned capital goods producing and selling goods for a profit.

I believe in capitalism, meaning everything is privately owned. I don't believe in wage slavery and I believe the profit and loss of privately owned goods is the best way to allocate scarce resources, leading to the best outcomes for the whole of society.

&gt; You will not get away without forcing some values, because some peoples values implicitly involves gross restrictions of the the freedoms of others. 

I agree with that. To minimise ""restrictions of the freedoms of others."", the best way to solve that, that I have seen so far, is polycentric law - Everyone has a ""rights enforcement agency"" and any conflict can be settled by a third party arbitrator.

The UK has made it's position quite clear, now.

All these analogies are so not even analogies that it makes my head hurt anyway.

The point is that you can't enter into a union of any sort where one of the members is not a willing participant. The UK says no, then it's tough.

But Scotland isn't ""losing"" some mythical ""10%"" here because that's not how currency works at all. Currency is just a make believe number backed by the stability and economy of the issuing state.

Scotland doesn't lose it's economy or stability (and what it does after secession if it fucks all this up is its own business!) but by default that fair share of the economic stability represented by this currency is embedded in Scotland's borders - industry, education, society, investment - everything that makes up the country.

Scotland can simply issue its own currency if it doesn't want the Euro - by default it can copy the state of the GBP in every way. 1:1 and all that good stuff. No union, so from that point on they will diverge.

But to argue that Scotland has had something taken from it unfairly is utter bull and a misunderstanding of how the economy even works.

But whatever - I personally don't think I should have any say in Scotland's actual decision - if they want autonomy and vote on it democratically then that's fine by me. But what pisses me off about referendums (AV, anyone?) is the amount of shit and misinformation that goes on before them. What use is voting if the public are completely mis-informed, really? I want Scotland to vote and I want every person who does vote to be fully informed about the true and accurate facts. If that happens then I would be completely happy with the outcome no matter which direction it falls. But the chance of that being the case, one way or the other, is very unlikely, it seems.

And even though I've sort of written on the side of Westminster here, that's only one issue, and not the absolute end all of the secession argument.

For example the whole ""difficult to impossible"" for an independent Scotland to join the EU thing is such unfair bullshit. It seems that it could actually be true and the case that Scotland can't even join the EU after a secession vote, but if that happens then the EU seriously needs to sort it's shit out, because it's plain as day that that is not the correct sequence of events!

Again going back to a fair vote - this whole EU issue is going to change minds in Scotland here and there - and it really shouldn't. Maybe there will be specific terms Scotland has to agree to to join the EU.

As for your question, I assume that it's going to be the same as ever in the premiership. The teams fighting for the top 4 are by no means small teams. They can attract big players, the bigger players they probably can't afford.

The bigger players want to be part of the bigger competitions, that is a given.

Man Utd being one of the biggest clubs in world football will survive a year at least without champions league, could they survive 2 years without it ? who knows, time will tell.

The fixture is lining up to be a great match with so much to get from the draw beyond the purely attractive financial incentives that come with progression and the guaranteed appearance on TV. Poyet always made us play a good game in the cup, i mean besides that fixture at Anfield (but that didn't take place apart from the Lua Lua free kick). 

i really do see Hull as a formidable threat, i mean they are performing very well in the premiership and will not be a team to leak goals are give us any hint of an easy win. I must say i am relieved that Jelavic and Long cannot play against us but that still leaves a very strong squad and the battle may be fought in midfield, if Ince is on his day it could be a deciding factor.

It would seem it is written in the stars to take Poyet to the Amex for a reunion but so too did a Zola Poyet reunion in the play off final that had much better odds. I think the game certainly favours Hull, they are the premiership team with a great squad, however if we are solid defensively and fight hard in the midfield there is no reason we couldn't snatch a narrow victory. Lua Lua is an enigma who could certainly strike effectively against a team like Hull, much of their team we will be familiar with from previous encounters and we beat them last time so lets wish for the same luck again.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;In any case, this doesn't affect the fundamental point, which is that Labour object when they are in opposition, they never have the opportunity to be simultaneously in that position, and in a position to immediately reverse the reforms. That is not how government and opposition works, except under the exceptional circumstances which currently apply.

The problem is that Labour oppose policies while in opposition, then enact them when in power. If your point is that SNP simply cannot do this because in a sense they are in power and opposition simultaneously, then I agree.

Labour have indeed opposed the NHS changes: Andy Burnham (shadow health secretary) says he'll repeal the Health and Social Care Act. But it's unlikely that he would be able to even if he really wanted to, which I very much doubt.  If we assume an outright Labour victory in 2015, by that time private sector providers will be well embedded in the NHS and willing to use EU legislation to retain their contracts. Andy Burnham knows that as well as I do. None of the main UK parties have the political will to fight that battle.

The other thing to check, whichever broker you speak to, is how they get paid. Most mortgage companies pay a commission to the broker who introduces customers to them, but some brokers will also charge you a fee. In other words they will be trying to get paid twice (once by the mortgage company and once by you, the customer)!

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; No, what I meant by ""capital goods and the pricing system"" is privately owned capital goods producing and selling goods for a profit.

The owner of the capital goods is entirely irrelevant to the market mechanism function as price setter and resource allocator. As an example, many state actors are heavily involved in existing capitalist markets, without influencing them much.

And producing and selling goods for a profit would of course be the point of using a market mechanism. 

The only difference would be where the dividends goes, and the mechanism for electing the board. Or rather, the only difference would be *the number of companies* where the owner is not a private individual or other private company.

For that matter, the history of cooperative ownership within a capitalist market is 250 years old, and in Europe cooperatives as an ownership mechanism predates capitalism by many hundred years.

Capitalism itself, in other words, have never been free of social ownership structures. 

&gt; I believe in capitalism, meaning everything is privately owned. I don't believe in wage slavery and I believe the profit and loss of privately owned goods is the best way to allocate scarce resources, leading to the best outcomes for the whole of society.

You keep conflating the concept of private ownership, and the concepts of resource allocation through market mechanisms, and yet they are not connected, and have never been connected throughout the history of capitalism. In fact, they *can not* be connected unless you are prepared to apply coercion to prevent people from forming groups to apply joint ownership through free association.
Especially in a panarchist society, where such groups could in fact be ""government providers"" in their own right.

What I find most bizarre, though, is how someone can genuinely believe that private ownership best allocates resources, given that *all history* we have of it demonstrates that it causes massively uneven distribution to an extent that de-facto deprives the vast majority of basic freedoms. 

You may not believe in wage slavery, but if you support capitalism, you indirectly support it.

&gt; I agree with that. To minimise ""restrictions of the freedoms of others."", the best way to solve that, that I have seen so far, is polycentric law - Everyone has a ""rights enforcement agency"" and any conflict can be settled by a third party arbitrator.

You will not be able to find a third party arbitrator that is neutral unless said third party arbitrator arbitrates only between people who both supports the same system. E.g. a conflict between us over private property rights would require the third party arbitrator to make a judgement over which system is 'right', because I would insist that private ownership over capital is a restriction on my freedoms, while you presumably would want to protect them.

Polycentric systems through history have worked by carving out niches where there are rarely cross-jurisdictional issues. E.g. some aspects of British family law allows the parties to choose an arbitrator, and the decisions are binding, but both parties must agree to the arbitrator, which means the court system must still deal with cases where the parties does not agree on the terms of arbitration.

By extension this is exceedingly unlikely to provide a solution for restrictions on freedom, as in many such conflicts one side will know in advance that their freedom will be restricted if they agree to arbitration. I for one would not agree for arbitration with a third party arbitrator likely to accept private ownership of capital, for example. It would make no sense for me to do so, unless the alternative is even more coercive. 

Ultimately this means that either arbitration will fail as an option for any important decisions, or society must still impose certain norms for what constitutes maximum freedom by force, or be unable to resolve conflicts, which by itself will impose certain norms.

You can try to escape having to make a decision on where and when to apply force, and violence, to maximise freedom, but you will not succeed. 

This is basically the argument both Marx and anarchists have for revolution: That even if a revolutionary party were to win an election, in the face of massive capitalist resistance, they would never be allowed to exercise their newfound legal powers without meeting military resistance, exactly because it is directly counter to the interests of anyone with substantial capital to accept such a change. And this is also the foundation for why so many freedom movements have been able to get so many people to pick up arms to overthrow a long list of governments, whether or not their leadership ultimately intended to provide actual freedoms or not.

US ivory crush and other ivory destruction programs. In short nobody really knows it's effects 100%. It depends on to many factors for instance if a country can defend seiesed ivory or not.

true,rbnc,cnty-wales,Wales. Living in Germany.,"&gt;Of cause it has a lower cost of living, it has a much lower gdp per capita than London has.

Just because salaries are high somewhere doesn't mean that ordinary people need to have a low quality of life or expensive housing costs.

Hamburg and Munich salaries are comparable to London. Yet housing costs are far lower.

Housings costs are related to supply and competition more than they are salaries.

The entire point being made here is that Germany is decentralised, there are less people competing for the same housing, therefore cost of housing is far lower.

This season we're knocked out by two top teams (yes, United are still a top team) at their ground shortly after beating them at home in the league. Both games could have gone either way as we dominated for large parts, failing to capitalise on chances - hardly Rodgers' fault. Not a fantastic year, but you can't say Rodgers has done a *bad* job.

* 2012/13 LC: 4th round loss away to Oldham

This was a bit more embarassing. Not a bad showing in the EL as we did ok in our group and only just went out, but hardly hugely impressive. Both domestic competitions went badly. Still, all results were in Rodgers first 3/4 months as manager with lots of big changes in the pipeline. Extenuating circumstances.

true,tomatoswoop,null,null,"(boring bit if you're not interested in why, but if you are, here it is.)

We use **past participles** of **verbs** as **adjectives**.

A **verb** is a doing or being word like play, or run, or existed.

*I play, you play, we play, I played they played etc.*

A **noun** is a thing, that exists in real life or in the mind, like football, or a wall, or London, or truth.

You can't *I London* or *they football or she walls* or *they bannister.*

An **adjective** is a describing word for a noun.  Big, red, scary.

So you can have a *red football* or say that *London is big*.  But you can't have *""a"" red,* or *""some"" big*.

The thing is, we can use **past participles** (*played, broken* etc.) of a **verb** (*to play, to break*) as an **adjective.**

So *football is played.  The wall is broken.*

Some words in english are **both nouns and verbs.**

So whereas you *play football*, you don't *football football*.  You do *bomb with a bomb, attack with an attack, drink a drink*.

Because **verbs can also become adjectives** (in this case by putting them in the past), you get words that are very similar as both the noun, and the adjective.

Attack is an example.

it's a noun.  **an attack is a thing.**

But, you can also *attack someone* right?  So it's **also a verb.**

So *I attack you, they attack him* etc.

Because of this you get a situation like bias, where attack and attacked are similar, like bias and biased are similar.


**---------the important bit:---------**

So if I punch you with a fist, you're now punched. (sorry, maybe I should have chosen a friendlier word).  You're not fist.  Or strike.  You're struck.  In this case it's easy because the words all sound different.  You won't accidentally say *""I've been fist""  or ""I've been punch"".  You'll say ""I've been punched"".*


But if *I attack you with an attack, you're attacked.*

fist = attack

punch = attack

punched = attacked


Bias is the same.  *I bias you with bias,* so now *you're biased.*

If you say *he is bias*  it's like saying *he is fist*  or *he is punch*.   Instead of *he is punched*.  Or *he is attack* instead of *he is attacked*",0,1392658200,null,0,false,0,cfhkmlk,t3_1y57pe,t1_cfhkmlk,t1_cfhjrh8,null,1432436305,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Pyrion_Flax,null,null,"I spoke to you guys at the event but I'd had a few pints by then so I'll try to be more coherent now.  
  
I think the event was good, the dota was good, and hopefully everyone had a good time. I know some teams were disappointed that their games weren't cast, and that's something to think about.  We don't need to announce a schedule ahead of time, we can be flexible so that if there is a game where the winner goes through and the loser fails to get out of the groups, that's WAY more exciting to cast than a game where two teams are just playing for seeding.  
  
BO3, BO3, BO5 on the final day - well, that sounds fun for the viewers but that would have killed us tbh. The players were pretty knackered by then too. My voice was suffering most of the weekend due to a sore throat so I might be biased, but I really think that potentially having to cast 11 games in one day would be too much for anyone.  
  
The issues with setting up everyone's pcs one game after an other was the only real problem over the weekend. We started late, and it was just exhausting and sucked all the atmosphere out of the cast but it's something that can be remedied so it's fine.  It's hard to sit around for two hours with no idea how long until the game starts and then switch on and be hyped for dota after that. 

We had a few people sitting around that we could have used for some between-game chat or just as a sort of casual post-game analysis thing. I think that was a missed opportunity.   
  
I didn't even realise there were other Dota 2 casters there so apologies for not saying hello!  
  
As for the bm and all chat stuff, the banter between teams was great and generally in the right spirit, but there is definitely a need for a bit of class and common sense to be shown. As .A says, giving shoutouts in game while pushing rax was not cool. There were a few occasions when people said stuff to each other between games that I have a hard time with. The team name DBAD summed up what should be everyone's rule : Don't Be A Dick. It's not hard: if you're intelligent enough to be good at Dota, you should have some manners too. 99% of the time, however, there were no issues and that was good to see.

Having casters on the stage next to players is a staple of LAN events, and it's not something that bothers me. Everyone understands what it means and it's really just a minor change to the normal way of casting.  
  
The player that had twitch chat open wasn't trying to cheat, I think he was just curious to see what people were saying. If it was an attempt to cheat, it was the least subtle and most hilariously inept attempt I've ever seen. So no, I don't think he should be banned. It was just a simple mistake. 

I didn't see any homophobic or racist abuse until after the event. You're right, it's totally unacceptable and it's not something we should ever put up with. People need to stop it.

I hope our casting was ok, it was difficult to get a rhythm going with a combination of the factors we've mentioned, and also the fact that some of the games we cast were just fairly cautious, dare I say it boring, Dota. It's luck of the draw and some games are better than others. I had a ton of fun, it was my first epicLan and I certainly hope I can come back again next time.

true,theOtherJT,null,null,"Oxford is, by UK standards, a _very_ small city. There's only about 150,000 people live here and that's pretty seasonal, with students and that. Also, it being full of university means there isn't a lot of stuff in it that you might expect from a town even of that size. There just isn't room.

It's savagely expensive - partly because it's full of students, many of whom are rich, foreign, or both which local business are keen to take advantage of, partly because it's full of tourists (see previous) and partly because it's on the commuter line to London, so house prices have been driven through the roof by people who work in the City moving here because it's actually quicker to get from Oxford to London at rush hour than it is to get from some of the more affordable parts of London to the centre. 

It is however a fairly nice place to live, as long as you can afford it and don't expect anything too exciting, and seeing as how London is only an hour or so away you can get pretty much all the missing shopping/night life type stuff there. 

With regards to places to live, North oxford is the nicest bit - up along the Woodstock and Banbury roads between the city centre and Summertown. Summertown itself is a pleasant sort of little suburban shopping centre. Heading back in toward town you'll pass through Jericho, which used to be a real slum, but is now massively on the up and one of the most desirable parts of the city these days. 

Out west along the Botley road there's a lot of new build - all fairly nice, but pretty boring - until you get to the large superstore type places there's no room for in the city proper. This bit of town floods a lot, and has spent most of the last month under water.

South, down the Abingdon road there's... nothing much. Student housing mostly. This also floods. 

East you'll find the Cowley/Iffley roads where Cowley Road in particular is the student centre of the city, lots of bars and takeaways, generally the ""lively and interesting bit"" but probably not really somewhere you'd want to live if you're over the age of 25.  Northeast from the Cowley road is Headington, which used to be a nicer area than it is these days, but mostly consists of slightly run down housing and the city's major hospitals. 

If you head further out you'll reach Cowley itself - the old industrial area from when Oxford was a major Car manufacturing city. There's still the BMW Mini factory out there, but it employs only a fraction of the people that the site used to 20 years ago, and as such Cowley has become a bit run down. It's surrounded by Rose hill and Blackbird leys housing estates - they're not particularly nice places, and you probably don't want to live there, but there's no part of town that's _dangerous_ as such, and unless you're worried about bicycle theft - which is epidemic - there's not a huge amount of crime here.

Well the jury is back and all the rUK parties not only disagree but are against it, as are the people.

The White Paper on Defence read more like a shopping list (the White Paper itself like an SNP manifesto), similarly to this there they also wanted a common procurement policy with the rUK.  The MoD dismissed it as unworkable.  

- [Scottish independence: MoD sinks white paper plan](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-mod-sinks-white-paper-plan-1-3213030)


And it is worryingly stupid if it is true that Salmond by omission from the White Paper is expecting the rUK to pay Scottish green energy subsidies to have access to Scottish windfarm energy to meet rUK carbon targets.  If that does turn out to be true then I'm laughing as I walk away.  The independence campaign, [if it is so](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/22/scotland-independence-cost-billions-renewables), has a hole in their accounting in what would be surging energy prices so large it has an event horizon.  It's not just the loss in subsidies, it's that if they don't replace them energy prices for everything will have to go up.

- [White Paper shows separate Scotland needs UK wind subsidy](http://www.scottishconservatives.com/2013/11/white-paper-shows-separate-scotland-need-uk-wind-subsidy/)

The sad thing is that I think an independent Scotland would have made a go of it, and that it could have been easily won.  That the reason the campaign is struggling is because Alex Salmond has made himself General at the same time trying to run a party.  He's greatly exaggerated his own abilities and the campaign would have been much better run by an effectual non-partisan with cross party support, recall a respected retiree like Dennis Canavan perhaps like a modern day Cincinnatus to run the campaign and no more.  

Salmond has claimed:  

- that he had consulted on Europe and that it was all okay.  It turned out he made that bit up.  

- he is now saying that there will be a currency union because it makes sense for the rUK.  It does not, and there's no interest for it.

Ever since the Time Lords disappeared into an alternate universe (originally thought to have been destroyed), several factions have attempted to take their mantle. The first being the Daleks. They already have time travel but have not achieved the mantle do to their constant defeats by the Doctor. The second being the Cyberman who have wanted access to time travel but have never achieved it. The third being the Kovarian faction of the Church (or the Silence). They basically breed a Time Lord to kill the Doctor and seem to have access to time travel thanks to the  next faction. That being Humanity. Humans of the 50th century have the Time Agency, which has a very similar mission to the Time Lords. 

None of the factions have come close to regulating time and space like the Time Lords. I think something or someone behind the scenes is preparing the Ood to take the Time Lords' mantle. The Ood are already time aware and some of them have the ability to project themselves through time. It has been shown in Torchwood that some beings can travel through time and space by natural means ( Billis Manger). Perhaps this is the state the Ood will eventually evolve to.

You have an opinion, that's nice. Suppose I'll vote no now.

&gt;As soon as the rest of the Union givesan opposing argument they take a sulk.

My problem and what I assume is the SNP's problem with Osbourne's intervention is that there is no compelling reason why there shouldn't be a currency union. Osborne's carefully worded speech even left room for a U-turn in the event of a yes vote. So if there's no compelling reason against a currency union, I'm left thinking that this was a poor spirited attempt to undermine the debate. The speech wasn't made to 'give the voters the facts', it was made to put the SNP and Yes into a corner. I dunno. To me it absolutely reeks of foul play. 

Why would Spain veto Scotland's application? They can say goodbye to fishing in Scottish waters if Scotland weren't a part of the EU. Scotland has been within the EU for 40 odd years. Goodness knows how many EU nationals reside here, and how many Scots reside elsewhere in the EU. As for Barroso, read this article http://derekbateman1.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/o-homem-e-um-asno/ 
Again with the EU, ask yourself what would be most beneficial to both parties, Scotland not being in the EU or Scotland being in the EU. That is the logic that will prevale post-yes. 
But until the refendum the Westminster establishment will keep barking on about currency &amp; EU.

The way people like you speak about 'can't have it both ways', it makes me think that you're of the view that the SNP want to take all the oil revenue, control 100% of tax paid in Scotland, but also want free access to the rUK NHS, defence, BBC. But it's nothing like that!

On another note, the SNP are popular in Scotland for a good reason. They are good in government. They are Tony Blair's Labour as it should have been. 

Opinion polls consistently show support for Yes gaining ground. Not surprising, considering how the no camp have been operating.  I think something like a 6 point swing is all that is required now.

That's why he says they are bluffing when they say they won't negotiate about it, he thinks that unless they just renege on the Edinburgh agreement and don't split everything fairly then both parties *have* to come to agreement over what happens to that percentage.

That's why he made the comment about Scotland not taking the debt, he's trying to hold rUK to their word and show that if they're going to start just deciding some things are excluded from the fair split then he can do that too. I don't think it's an actual threat, he's not a total moron and understands the effect it would have.. he's bringing to light how childish it seems to just come out and say they won't even discuss it when the whole time all the press has been ""*If you want out we won't be dicks and we'll negotiate in good faith*"".

Salmond would like currency union, it would be the most stable route for Scotland because it would be the least disruptive but I'm not convinced he actually believes he'll get it. He's a politician and from day one he's positioned himself as the nice guy, the fair guy, the guy who can come to a compromise.

Also I agree about why Jose did not rotate if he KNEW the players would be tired. He goes in depth about why the players were tired but never explains his selection. Anyway, looks like the players got a 2 day rest so hopefully they should be good to go vs Everton.

I understand the point you're making and of course the police shouldn't be made a special case. However, in this instance, they're being held in a lower standing than most members of the public.

If there'd been people unconnected with the young man who was swearing nearby it's likely that the conviction would not have been overturned. The test was whether the people who could hear the swearing would have been alarmed, distressed or harassed.

What the Judge is saying here is that the police can be assumed to not be alarmed, distressed or harassed as they must hear it all of the time. He probably wouldn't have said the same thing about a ""normal"" member of the public, unconnected with this youth.

I agree the police should be held to the same standard as other citizens, but in this case it appears that they are held in a lower standing than others, which is wrong.

true,ChristheGreek,lfc68,null,"The loss on Sunday reminded me of the second leg of the quarter final Champions League tie against Chelsea in 2009. At the time we were in the same sort of situation in the league where we are now: playing really well -- the team was playing really confidently and thought they were going to win every game. We ended up losing to Chelsea over the two legs, but we played really well in that second leg and as a result, the loss didn't really damage morale and affect our league form. 

I feel it's going to be the same with the loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup. We were really unlucky not to win or at least get a replay out of the game; it was a really good performance. I think the players know this and it won't have much of an effect on the level of confidence of the team. 

I think at the beginning of Brendan's reign he was telling the team that the most important thing he wanted from the team was a good performance. In other words, even if the team lost, if they played decently, he was telling the that if they put in performances like that every week the results will come. Hopefully now he is telling them that the team has evolved and now expectations are different. There will be those days where Liverpool is playing well against smaller teams but the goal just isn't coming. Those are the games where the players can't feel sorry for themselves and have to find a way to score a goal (sounds cliche, I know). The 2008-2009 team had that mentality and I remember them pulling results out against teams like Portsmouth (coming from behind and winning 3-2 and at Fulham away, winning 1-0 near the end thanks to a Benayoun goal). Also hopefully he is establishing a team ethos so that even when the team is playing badly they can still nick a result (another cliche: the good teams win even when they aren't playing well).

Never mind that Croatia and Bulgaria and Lithuania and Ukraine.. have to pass stringent economic tests and get approval from other member states following detailed negotiations, Salmond somehow thought it was in his gift to make promises. I would be prepared to countenance a currency union between Scotland and rUK if the SNP were prepared to consider the views of voters in rUK but no, there's never any suggestion from them that we should get a say in whether we want to accept the risks of a currency union. We've just supposed to accept it being imposed on us. 

I've never supported the UK  joining the Euro because I think basically you need a working framework of political union before a currency union can work effectively.  The eurozone has been giving plenty of evidence for this, in order to stay in the euro countries like Greece and Spain have been ceding policy control to the bigger players, especially Germany - in order to get the Germans to continue taking on the risk. We've seen what happens if you tell people they can have a currency union without a political union, why does the SNP think any one either side of the border is going to fall for that again?!

However, while key individuals like Tim Kelsey, National Director for Patients and Information, allege to be listening to resulting concerns and formulating actions to allay them, I am uncomfortable with the pace at which care.data is progressing, just as I was with the latest NHS restructure.

Having designed studies in the past, and sat on an ethics committee, I know that it can be difficult to achieve balance between ensuring a simple message easily digestible by the majority of the public and a message that fully conveys the nuances and complexities of a project. A complex issue like the forthcoming vote on Scottish independence is a good example of information overload, the effective communication of which is damaged by political grandstanding.

For care.data, what may prove more beneficial than a two A4-sheet leaflet are well-chaired and well-structured nationally televised summaries of information, concerns and their validity, as well as the context in which care.data will operate.

I have no objection to the care.data project in principle, based on my experience of using and gaining access to the health data already available. However, viewed from the perspective of a citizen unfamiliar with existing databases and established rules concerning the use of health data for research purposes, care.data as an extension of existing systems has not been communicated very well at all, nor, specifically, what is and is not being opted out of.

*Edit: a re-reading of the [PIA](http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pia-care-data.pdf) this evening suggests that the opt-out will apply to all health data uploaded to and accessible via the HSCIC, and not just from GP practices.*

&gt;""The NHS constitution gives patients the right to object to their personal confidential data leaving their GP practice. [...] Patient objections will be upheld other than in exceptional circumstances such as a public health emergency. [...] At present, it is not possible for patients to prevent flows of confidential data from other care settings into the HSCIC, for example from hospitals. For this reason, we have ensured that patients can also object to the disclosure of confidential data from the HSCIC. 

*The wording isn't the clearest in the world, but it sounds as though the single opt-out will permit data to continue to be uploaded for analysis, but absent of identifiers. It would therefore not be possible to link data from individual sources, such as prescriptions, hospital episodes and consultations.*",0,1392666856,null,0,1392667839,0,cfhoal4,t3_1y3kx9,t1_cfhoal4,t1_cfhh6ns,null,1432438100,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;  By all statistical accounts we played well in the first half of this season

We actually did play quite well in the first half of the season. The style of play was slow and ponderous however we were good at creating chances, and not just bad chances but actual good chances aswell. Often the generally slow style of play clouded people's judgement on how good we were at creating chances. Our defense was at times absolutely incredible at restricting oppositon chances aswell. If you were for example to watch a video consisting of the chances we created vs chances we conceded in the early part of the season under AVB it would be quite impressive.

Why does it seem like other developed countries have train services so much better than ours?

Whether you see any investment in your 'local' railway depends on where in the UK you are.

As examples, Virgin have made some of their Pendolino trains longer, there have been new diesel trains in the Midlands and massive investment in the South East eg London Overground and Southeastern's Javelin trains.

If you get a 'big bang' sort of improvement with new trains and rebuilt stations all at once it's noticeable.

Meanwhile if you're in Wales, the South West or large parts of the North you'll get the old diesels from the Midlands transferred over... Yes it's a few more trains but it's not an obvious improvement because its more of what you already have.

EDIT: Other countries have also done things differently. France has a very good high-speed network in the TGV  but that has come at the cost of little to no investment in many local and rural services. There are even plans by the French state railways to close some lesser used branch lines I believe.

I didn't ask you to, I asked you to accept that the scottish government's definition of poverty isn't the be all and end all of what actually qualifies as poverty. If the median start earning more and purchasing power doesn't change then poverty will increase even though quality of life remains identical. If everyone goes back to poor houses and works in mines for 50p a day, then the median income drops dramatically and poverty decreases. Attaching the word poverty to some arbitrary percentage of median income means nothing without context, as I've already said.

true,SomeCruzDude,flair8,,"&gt;Feeling on salary cap?

Salary cap is a good thing that keeps MLS even, and the ""cap"" gets raised every year or at least with every CBA (collective bargaining agreement) of the players. So it is keeping the league pretty even which is always nice. Even though TFC, Seattle, NY, and LA can go for the big players, they still have to afford a whole squad with their remaining cash. It makes for interesting teams.

&gt;feeling on...relegation/promotion?

Pro/rel will not be a thing in American soccer for a very very very long time. Scares away investors pretty much. Maybe down the line it will be used for the lower leagues but not yet. Having fixed teams allows for there to be investors that will be willing to take the plunge and invest knowing that their team will be a fixture in the league and that it doesn't risk playing in a division that could make attendance worse, players leave, etc.

&gt;Should MLS be more like European leagues and have a more free market for player talent?

I think that MLS will need to loosen up in some rules and be a bit more clear, such as how Clint Dempsey became a player for Seattle skipping what at the time was the set format of ""allocation order"" or which teams had the first rights to talk with an American national team player coming back to the league. As the years go on it will get more and more loose, but looking at how Financial Fair Play isn't doing much in Europe it is nice to see that MLS stays a very balanced league.

Lets take a quick walk through feminist history - first wave feminism 'we are equal and should be treated thus' second (and largely third) 'we are women and are special and should be treated thus'.

Basically later feminisms built upon the division of the sexes, provided the gynocentric approach (in response to androcentric) and we have women are x and men are y. This is shite, several levels.

Regarding Rape and feminism - within the early 2nd wave thread - a wonderful chap called Michel Foucault' argued that 'sex' should be removed from rape, that it should be referred to as assault. The feminists, at first, liked this idea because it the viewed sex as a tool of oppression and viewing rape as merely assault took away the oppressive/power aspect of it - equality notions were initially thought good. 

BUT - guess what happened - the feminists noticed that by reducing rape to assault would not be in their best interests so the lovely Mr Foucault was disparaged. And thus 'rape' as something that solely females endured was used to further the feminist agenda. 

Scroll forward several decades and we still have the hysteria regarding rape. Raising our children in very restrictive ways. Telling our daughters to be ware of men and our sons to behave around girls - defining our sons with an unmanageable sexuality and our daughters with a precious possession that some male will take. 

WTAF people! Feminism has done this - it has made people fear their own sexuality, it has made women who enjoy thoroughly enjoy sex to be somewhat outcast, it has made men question their own desires. It has policed sex out of sex and made something that is natural and amazing and fun into a weapon that ultimately leaves the sexes in opposition from each other and alienated from themselves. 

Im sick to my back teeth of this hysteria! Rape happens end of, it has always happened, it happens in countries where porn restrictions are high and countries with a liberal approach to sex. It happens. It happens to men and women in equal portions. IT HAPPENS.

It is illegal as much as taking cocaine is illegal, as much as murder is illegal and as much as taking something which doesn't belong to you is illegal. People have always murdered, taken prohibited substances and stole from others. Singling out a specific crime does nothing to change its illegality or halt it happening.

My opinion - lets return to Michel Foucault's idea and remove the sexual angle from rape and maybe that way all this BS about the verbal connotations of the word rape can be placed where they belong - in the bin.

Van bommel  also should have gone earlier too along with 6-7 other yellows (some second yellows) that he didnt give just to let the game flow. That match totally got away from him. God this sounds awful because you used it in your point but, when I think of a typical example of poor reffing I genuinely use that World cup final as an example. 

I think reffing is an phenomenally tough job and frankly, I have no idea how linesman get it so right so often - pure gifted. It absolutely amazes me. But I think this is just one too far for me regarding Webb. He's now making massive massive errors on a match to match basis. It still amazes me that he didnt give Suarez a penalty Vs. Chelsea let alone the Arsenal one. 

He won't get two more stonewall penos or two easier decisions than that this year and he's blown both for whatever reason. I really am not one for the whole ""ref is biased etc"" argument but I just don't believe a ref at that level could miss the etou' challenge on Suarez. He was looking straight at it even after the ball went - genuinely bizzare shout. There's just no way he missed it, and shame on him if he did. 

'Balanced reffing' is also a huge issue at the moment. Letting one decision go because you made a poor one earlier is worse in my opinion. Every decision should be made regardless of the time in the game or previous decisions (eg. Not sending stevie off when it was a blatant yellow) and he's one of the most guilty when it comes to that. 

As far as the cup goes, I don't love the way we went out but there are so many positives to take. Webb just pushed me one too far this time :)

As examples: it maybe Scotland/UK negotiations from 2014 are very very bad, causing the UK to threaten a veto.

Yes, it is a huge advantage to have a player of his caliber on your team, just like when we had Luka, Berbatov, Carrick, or any number of other very-important players that we've had that went elsewhere. 

We were becoming a one-trick pony as we relied upon Bale to carry us time and time again, and he was THE reason we finished where we did. You will always have a player who is leading the charge, and right now we have Ade doing that for us, but I think that his success is coming more from good support and not just relying on Bale to create magic out of nothing. 

Every buy is a risk.  Even considering how Lamela and Soldado are performing, I still think that we ended up on the positive side for the club. They will find their form in time, hopefully, and we are starting to see some really strong contributions from some of the other new additions and stepping up from others. It really comes down to the idea that I'd rather have 6-7 really good players than one exceptional one.

Despite the fact that our second team is pretty much our first team, with the 6 replacements we have- that is not the issue. Newcastle and Swansea have larger squads, and they could have (and often did) field B Teams, and look where it has got them. The problem comes when you are taking away the manager from coaching the team in preparation for the weekend fixture for at least 3 days, not fatigue. 

The brain trust is our competitive advantage, and if they are spending half their time working on other gameplans- away from the A team, then the Premier League side are going to seriously suffer regardless. 

There are some teams that can pull this off (Atletico for example), but that is because they had enough quality all round to just roll over a lot of the league oppositions without that incredible focus on specific gameplans.

So it seems that when the Conservatives in the USA where talking about ""Death Panels"" and the NHS, our government might have been taking the harping on as an inspiration, an idea in fact!

Never thought I would refer to Sarah Palin for a reference but to quote Wikipedia on this...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel

&gt; ""Death panel"" is a political term that originated during the 2009 debate about federal health care legislation to cover the uninsured in the United States. 

&gt; The term was coined in August 2009 by Sarah Palin, the former Republican Governor of Alaska, when she charged that the then-proposed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would create a ""death panel"" of bureaucrats who would decide whether Americans—such as her elderly parents or children with Down syndrome—were ""worthy of medical care"".  
Palin's claim, however, was debunked, and it has been referred to as the ""death panel myth"", as nothing in any proposed legislation would have led to individuals being judged to see if they were worthy of health care. Palin specified that she was referring to Section 1233 of bill HR 3200 which would have paid physicians for providing voluntary counseling to Medicare patients about living wills, advance directives, and end-of-life care options.

And then on Palin's talk about the (or our) NHS:

&gt; On August 12, Palin said ""the elderly and ailing would be coerced into accepting minimal end-of-life care to reduce health care costs"" and charged on Twitter that Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was an evil ""death panel"", leading to so many replies from British citizens defending the NHS that Twitter crashed. Disabled professor Stephen Hawking led the responses, saying ""I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for the NHS.""

&gt; In a September 2009 speech, Palin said the term was ""intended to sound a warning about the rationing that is sure to follow if big government tries to simultaneously increase health care coverage while also claiming to decrease costs."" In November 2009 Palin said that Obama was ""incorrect"" and ""disingenuous"" when he called the ""death panel"" charge ""a lie, plain and simple."" In the National Review she said:

&gt; &gt;""[t]o me, while reading that Section of the bill, it became so evident that there would be a panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some government-controlled coverage ... Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of course, to death.""

Please don't let it be that ""even a broken clock is right twice a day""...

If only the BBC reported this on Radio 4 or on its lunchtime news segment. 

You know that if this were to pass, it would not only be ""the elderly"" who would be assessed, but for the life of me *I can't seem to find any inspirations or examples of the Government assessing people medically for anything they could qualify for...*

Dalry is an ok area, although it does get a bit dodgy the further down and closer to Gorgie you are. Saying that, the side streets from the main road are often much quieter and usually the same price.

From my experience nothing is particularly far (within reason) in Edinburgh if you can invest in a Lothian bus card, then you can just get the bus across town as and when you need.

My advice would be, focus on getting an affordable flat within a reasonable distance on a 6 month contract. If you find the area unfriendly or inconvenient for work then you've got 6 months to find some where better once you're more familiar with the area and your work.

When I moved from the Midlands to Edinburgh to study, I just spent a weekend walking all over the area near to the university and asking in estate agents for affordable flats within a reasonable distance. Picked one, put my application in for a shitty box flat just off of Gorgie road, but it was only for 6 months.

&gt;

&gt;**Elisabeth Clara Heath-Sladen**  (1 February 1946  – 19 April 2011 ) was an [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people) actress best known for her role as [Sarah Jane Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jane_Smith) in the British television series Doctor Who. She was a regular cast member from 1973 to 1976, alongside both [Jon Pertwee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pertwee) and [Tom Baker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker), and reprised the role many times in subsequent decades, both on Doctor Who and its spin-offs, K-9 and Company and The Sarah Jane Adventures. 

&gt;Sladen was interested in ballet and theatre from childhood, and began to appear on stage in the mid-1960s, although more often as a [stage manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_manager) at this time. She moved to London in 1970 and an appearance in the police drama Z-Cars led to her being selected for a part in Doctor Who. She stayed as a regular cast member alongside Pertwee and Baker until 1976. She subsequently starred in other roles on both television and radio, before semi-retiring to raise a family in the mid-1980s.

&gt;She returned to the public eye in the 2000s with more Doctor Who related appearances, which culminated in taking a regular lead role in The Sarah Jane Adventures. The show earned the [Royal Television Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Television_Society) 2010 award for Best Children's Drama. She also made regular guest appearances on the main television series, and provided voice-over commentaries for its releases to DVD.

&gt;Sladen died of cancer on 19 April 2011. Her death made national and international news headlines, and major television stations and newspapers paid her tribute.

Vellios, I agree he's awful, but we should give our whole striking options a mix-up next season. Also, I missed out Koné but he's been non-existant anyway I guess.

Gibson is apparently performing miracles in his recovery and should be back earlier than expected so he should get a whole summer pre season under his belt. Oviedo still has a chance of even making the world cup accoring to some.

true,chriswalkenspal,null,null,"My girlfriend and I began watching Dr Who a few month's ago (starting with Eccleston's 9th Dr) and just finished the most recent episode last night.

We loved watching Eccleston as The Doctor so much. Still do. We waver back and forth on whether we love David Tennant as the Doctor more or less than Eccleston. Some days he's better, some days he isn't. But we loved watching them both. Then we began watching Matt Smith as the Doctor. We had high hopes to be sure but this was Doctor Who so of course it would be fantastic.

We got about to where you stopped, Matt Smith's 3rd or 4th episode, when we just turned to each other and said, ""I don't like this Doctor."" For the longest time we couldn't understand what it was that made us feel this way. But we kept watching in hopes that it would get better.

It did get better. But not for another 2 and a half seasons (I mean series). It was his companion that we didn't like! I'm not going to spoil any big plot detail but we all know that the Doctor's companions don't last forever and he does move on and get new ones. Needless to say when Amy Pond departs the show it was almost like watching a new Doctor. So we finished the last 6 or 7 episodes and we are both excited to see what Peter Capaldi does with the Doctor.

I did like River Song though. Our opinions are different on that one. Her character is more than just a mystical creature that follows him around. at the 3rd episode of Matt Smith's run, we've only seen once or twice and don't know anything about her yet.

And watch Tennant's last season (I mean series). Donna is a fantastic character and a huge surprise to me as I couldn't stand Catherine Tate in the U.S. The Office.

All the cartels we are most familiar with are legislated and formed by the government, like the energy market. (actually I just watched the video and he mentions this at the end!)

Competition in the free-market will give the customers what they want. whether that is ethical, or not, only the customer can decide. I believe big companies would be more ethical in a free-market because they would be accountable for their actions, which is not the case right now.

For example, if a company wanted to start drilling and fracking, if they damaged the environment and people's homes, in free-market capitalism, they would be accountable for that. They would have to put things right and pay some compensation for all the trouble they caused.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It seemed likely at the time that Bale would be sold

It really didnt, this was the first article reporting in the english press that he wanted to leave.

&gt; They claim to have insider information on both Tottenham's dealings and Bale's camp without indicating they have sources or providing any quotes or evidence

I see this zombie idea is still making the rounds on here. Absolutely incredible - time and time again it's being proven false, yet ignorant people will still come back with it. And quite patently he does have sources in Bales camp and in the cub. 

&gt; That, to me, is bad journalism.

I think its already being established that your idea of bad journalism is well, slightly skewed to say the least...

Even though Downing started to come good and Henderson is coming good, the prices we paid for them makes them bad deals, if not bad signings. You can't allow 1.5 seasons' bedding down period for players you've spent 16-20m on. Especially Henderson - the whole point of buying young is you pay less, but we paid 16m for a player who has only now reached that valuation, let alone surpassed it. 

Enrique and Bellamy were good signings. 

Adam was a limited and mediocre signing, but one capable of doing a specific job (i.e. backup to Gerrard) - right now I'd argue he was a better signing than Aspas is, although Aspas looks the more capable player, simply because Adam did more for us on the pitch than Aspas has.

Coates will go down as a bad signing, but that's harsh - Rodgers doesn't rate him, not much Kenny can do about that, sometimes signings just fall through the cracks when managers change.",0,1392677095,null,0,false,0,cfhta2n,t3_1y4weq,t1_cfhta2n,t1_cfhok0h,null,1432440485,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,nocaph,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"No, they don't have an unlimited supply of money.  But they're approaching the problem from the wrong angle or they're approaching the wrong problem.  

Firstly, there's the issue of pharmaceutical companies holding monopolies on drugs with patent, change the chemical a bit, and repatent, being able to exploit that by charging extortionate amounts.  Look in the [BNF](http://www.bnf.org/bnf/index.htm) and see the difference between patented drugs and drugs that have become generic.  

I compared two of the medications I'm on, Lyrica (pregabalin) costs £64.40 (56 tablets) every time I'm prescribed it, which is every month.    Clonazepam however, which is generic, is £3.58 for 100 tablets (and I only use 30 a month).  The issue shouldn't be assessing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, it should be holding to account the industries that keep widely needed drugs hostage and ask for a monthly ransom for each patient.

That's even if you're looking at it from a drug cost-effectiveness way of saving money in the NHS, and as I've implied in my posts above they're looking in the wrong place.  There are financial sinkholes going totally under the radar not because patients are wasting doctors' time, but because of the unstable infrastructure and poor communication between departments.  Patients are having their time wasted being bounced around, having to go back because a problem wasn't listened to or addressed or treated properly the first, second or third time.

For the coast-to-coast section I would heavily recommend the Glen Affric route from Cannich to Morvich, plenty of wild camping in the woods and mountainsides and there's a hostel halfway.

I haven't been to Skye a lot but I understand it is best toured with wheels to get to all the corners, it will be busy in May too.

However, Assynt is vast and stunning and you could spend a week each hiding out in the sublime hills of Knoydart, Morar, Torridon or Fisherfield.

Have a look at the OS map on geograph.org for checking potential camp sites out.

Tent peg wise I use the 7-8 inch wire ones rather than the angled metal ones as they get round stones a bit easier.

The place was a fucking shit hole. Tab ends, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and god knows fucking what strewn all over the shop. My brother exclaimed I was a “bender” for stubbing my tabs out on the ground and waiting until I found a bin. He nearly had a fucking heart attack when I produced a portable ashtray from my bag. “Ooh! Pass the fuckin’ salt an pepp-ah y’posh cunt” were his words. 


Heading back to Japan, I had to spend the night in London and ended up in Soho. Got talking to these Spanish birds who were smoking tac outside the pub and kindly offered me to join them. They thought it was fantastic when they saw that I threw my tab ends in the bin.

true,Kreindeker,pertwee,Pertwee,"I'll be the odd one and say that I adored the third series. Martha's development was limited, yes, but Tennant's ham acting had really toned down and that pays off really well. When he starts describing the Time War in the New Earth-based one, he's a lot calmer and more assured. When he and Jack are talking about the latter's resurrection, he really shows the Doctor's mix of curiosity, sadness, guilt, joy and excitement in Utopia. That three parter closer, by the way, despite John Simm chewing the bloody scenery, was great. I'll actually admit to liking almost all of the rest of the run. I liked 42. I liked the episode with Shakespeare, Smith and Jones, the aforementioned New Earth adventure, and liked the Dalek two-parter. 

Now, there are elephants in the room with most of them. Shakespeare inventing words to defeat the Carrionites was twee as a conclusion , and the Human Dalek was a cyclops with head penises. 42 was great until the climax with the sentient sun. The Lazarus Experiment 
was, I'll admit, a travesty of an episode. Mark Gatiss just being mentally warped by his transformation would have been so much better, and a few verbal battles between the two before, perhaps, Lazarus takes his own life would have been far more effective and not had the Monster of the Week feel it was left with. 

Enough has been said about Blink to fill about six volumes of an encyclopaedia, but I'll just say that the hype is justified and is a wonderful horror tale on its own. Now, the true best bit of it all. 

Human Nature/Family of Blood has just the most perfect and powerful acting in the whole new run, maybe at all. When Smith has his dilemma, and he sees what he could have, you wouldn't believe how much I wanted him to take it. And then, crying happened with the bridge resolution. Not of happiness. Of sorrow.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; 10 years ago, the route I frequently take used to be run by Virgin. Perhaps my memory is cloudy, but it seemed quite a bit nicer back then. It was definitely a hell of a lot cheaper, even accounting for inflation.

Ticket pricing I can't explain, apart from the obvious fact that we are being ripped off because often there is only one operator in an area. I think the Major government of the 90s had some romantic idea of 2 or 3 different companies all competing in most areas after privatisation, but the franchising system basically stopped that from happening.

&gt; XC took over the route and their trains get more and more crowded. They haven't increased the train size or frequency in the 6 or so years they've run it. They have also been getting more and more unreliable. 30 min delays are the norm now, not the exception.

The XC franchise was originally Virgin as you say. When it went to Arriva they got half of Virgin's fleet of diesel trains - the Voyager type trains. Virgin want to replace the other half of their diesel fleet with 'mini' Pendolinos.

Because of the mess with the WCML franchising, Virgin currently have no incentive to order 20 or so new trains because they don't know who will win the bid in three years. If Virgin win the franchise again in three years they could order the new trains and send the rest of the diesels to XC. In my opinion the government is actually over managing things here.

&gt; If all the network was run by one publicly owned company, then I can understand investment being focused on specific areas at a time, meaning it could be a while before you get to enjoy it on your route. But these are all private companies, each running their own much smaller network. Why aren't all of them making incremental improvements? Why only some?

The Northern Rail franchise was let as a 'zero growth' franchise - in other words Government did not forecast passenger numbers growing. [Passenger numbers increased by 20 million in 4 years](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WQBLxE0vdDwC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=""zero+growth+franchise""&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yxtfh0H3p2&amp;sig=Q4cqxRDKzjfnqy1q4nvWeKVzB88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZqoCU_HLDIrK0QWH74HAAg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zero%20growth%20franchise%22&amp;f=false)

The Wales and Borders franchise was also let on a zero growth basis.

If the franchises are let with the operators being told not to expect an increase in customers during the time they are running them, they will not invest in brand new trains. Both regions have had extra trains from across the country - Scotland, Essex and the Midlands - but only older trains once other operators have upgraded their fleets.",0,1392684762,null,0,false,0,cfhwpz3,t3_1y4rvt,t1_cfhwpz3,t1_cfhs6x3,null,1432442244,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"You should definitely buy membership. Last season you could get a ""Light"" membership for £26.99 (All regions) which gives you access to those all important tickets. The full membership was £34.99 UK, £38.99 Europe, £42.99 ROW, but it's not worth it unless you're going to make use of the discounts. The membership pack is usually awful. Details of the different packages are here:  http://www.liverpoolfc.com/membership/benefits-prices. **Note:** that link shows prices for the remainder of the season. Full 14/15 membership will be more expensive

Once you've got your membership sorted, you're good to go. I can't guarantee how they'll organise the sales next season but in recent years they've sold them all in two blocks: first half of the season in July, second half in November. **If you want tickets you need to be online as soon as they go on sale.** I can't stress this enough. Day 1 of sale at 9:15 (or whatever time the sale starts) you need to be in front of your computer ready to hit refresh many, many times. You should get in to the system pretty quickly, but it's probably best to not have much to do that morning, just in case.

**Note:** I've not been to a league game for a couple of years and not since they've brought in the ""two sales a season"" idea. They may have sorted the website out since then so the 30 minute refresh debacle might be a thing of the past. On the other hand, if they haven't, it's probably worse than when games were sold individually.

**Note 2:** LFC have a loyalty system for Member's tickets: for United and Everton, the whole Member's allocation is sold based on loyalty. For example, the Everton match was initially sold to members who had been to 7 league home games the previous season. For all other Category A and B games (Aston Villa, Arsenal, Swansea, Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle.) the pool of member's tickets gets split in two: first half are sold to people with loyalty (13 home games last season) and the other half is a free for all.

For Category C games (all the other teams) any member can buy a ticket on the 1st day of sale.

You probably know this already, but it might help someone else travelling from abroad who reads this: dates are subject to change. The TV rights holders often move Saturday games to Sunday or even Monday. Also, teams who play in the Europa League on Thursdays, never have matches scheduled on the following Saturday. Hopefully we won't be that competition, but there's a chance we'll play someone who is.

Standard back four.

Midfield ""3"" will be Sandro holding, Bentaleb, Paulinho/Dembele. Eriksen will play the position we've seen where he's listed as a winger but really just plays across the top of the box as an AM. 

What this means is that: whoever is listed as the other winger provides the attacking width and will switch wings a lot (happened a good bit against Newcastle)--&gt; the opposite flank will get its width from a fullback--&gt; Whatever fullback is further up will be covered by Sandro/Centre back.

&gt;The **Doctor Who missing episodes** are the instalments of the long-running British [science-fiction television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme Doctor Who with no known [film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) or [videotape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape) copies. They were destroyed by the [BBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) during the 1960s and 1970s for economic and space-saving reasons.  There are 26 incomplete Doctor Who serials, with 97 of 253 episodes from the first six years of the programme missing. Many more were thought to be lost until copies were recovered from various sources, mostly overseas broadcasters.

DVDs have also been released of surviving episodes from otherwise-missing serials, and tele-snaps exist of many missing episodes.*

true,Iliad93,present,Frank Lampard,"Well Chalobah has been touted to be in line to be in the squad next season by Mourinho. I think this would be great nad there definitely seems to be space opening up for him in the squad to seize a spot. Essien has already left and I'm not sure Lampard is getting a contract extension. Even if he does, he'll serve as a super sub player and will be in rotation with players like Chalobah.

I see our midfield next season as Ramires/Matic/Mikel/Marco Van Ginkel/Chalobah

That's good depth and tactical choice as well. Ramires and Matic will probably be the first choice pairing, but Marco Van Ginkel will deputise for Ramires and Chalobah can for Matic. 

So Chalobah is the likeliest.

PVA also has a decent chance. We have a left back conundrum building. Doubt We'll playing Dave on the wrong side again next season, it seems like a temporary solution. We essentially have to pick two out of the following 4 options:

Extend Ashley's contract. Hope that with a consistent run of games he can regain his form, or can serve as a reliable second choice player.

Recall Bertrand

Recall PVA

Marquee signing like Shaw.

Can't pretend I'll know what the board will choose to do, but PVA certainly stands a chance of grabbing one of the two left back positions opening up in the summer.

Moses has a small chance of being in the squad again as a 6th choice attacking midfielder, but unlikely. ",0,1392690283,null,0,false,0,cfhz6vb,t3_1y69ug,t1_cfhz6vb,t3_1y69ug,null,1432443408,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

The story is notable for its demonstration of Susan's telepathy and references to the Doctor's and her home planet.

I wouldn't worry about our attack too much right now. The pace and skill of Arsenal's midfield should really break us down if Martinez uses a high line like v Liverpool. If our defence can play clever we can nick a goal and get a draw.
