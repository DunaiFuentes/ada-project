true,raspy01,eng-lancashire,Britain's Longest Cul-de-Sac,"This isn't really preferable as there is no guarantee for the staff member that their pay will change according to the cost of living - I have a few specific problems with what the government is doing and I'll try my best to summarise them for you:

* The people that perform well enough to reach the next pay point within their band are being given their extra cash because of their extra worth to the NHS, NOT to allow them to keep up with the cost of living. What if, for example, someone has to take time off due to sickness and doesn't reach their appraisal targets - this person is then paid a comparatively lower wage through no fault of their own. EDIT: Also, the lack of a pay rise in line with inflation devalues the increase a staff member gets for good performance, because a part of their extra pay will have to be used to offset increased cost of living.
* New starters are unfairly disadvantaged. When you first start, obviously, you are paid at the lowest point on a band. If there is no pay rise for banded posts, the lowest point stays exactly the same as it was four (I think) years ago. The cost of living goes up every year, so essentially a nurse getting their first job now is being paid a lower wage than a newly qualified nurse four years ago.
* Pay increase from promotions is lessened. When you apply for and get a post at a higher banding than your own, it is my understanding that you start back at the bottom of the pay points again. This means that if a nurse today is deemed talented enough to advance a band up the scale, they will receive less pay in real terms than someone gaining a promotion four years ago will have done (similar to the above).
* Fairness. Why should non-banded staff be handed a pay rise (albeit a miserly one) regardless of their performance, whereas banded staff are basically told ""perform well or you don't get any more money""?

There are other problems swimming round my head as well but I can't think straight enough to convert them to prose. I'm only writing this as I'm procrastinating when I should be working on a clinical diploma :D There is one other looming problem, especially in my area of expertise, where the disparity of pay between the public and private sector is so huge that there is a shortage of people taking up jobs within the NHS, most noticeably in more rural areas.  And again in my profession, the difference in pay between UK professionals and those in other socialised healthcare states such as Canada is quite terrifying - to the point that people come to the UK to get their degree and go back home knowing full well they will earn enough to pay off the debt, even with international fees.

true,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I think one of the problems with this is that it is, by modern standards, an entirely unreasonable law.

Jointly and severally liable means that the church, if they chose to, could go after a single parishioner for the entire cost of maintaining the church building. Nobody, local or outsider, is going to want to own a house with that hanging over it.

People don't only buy houses to sell on later. But everyone hopes that their house will continue to at least maintain most of its value in real terms. It will be sold at some point, they might want to downsize and retire, or at least pass it on to their children. They don't want their investment to be reduced to almost worthlessness because the church has threatened to take advantage of an unfair law which everybody forgot about 100 years ago.

Does this only apply to sleepy villages? The modern estate I live on has a dilapidated parish church on it, maybe the 1000s of houses here are all liable. A lot of towns and cities have expanded out into historic parishes of former villages.

And why does someone who was born in a lovely village, at random, growing up in fantastic surroundings, have a special right to have the same privilege as an adult? Isn't someone who grew up in an inner city slum allowed to work hard and get somewhere nice to live?

He took his time at Everton, got the players he wanted and then took it from there. So, what I'm trying to say is Moyes is never gonna play an attractive game but I think he has what it takes to deliver results (at the cost of playing a boring game too).

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"It'll be a carbon copy of the Arsenal vs. Man United game; boring, tentative football because neither side wants to drop 3 points. Spurs have played terribly in their last two matches (Benfica is included in that) and will settle for a point to at least go towards their CL efforts. Arsenal will be disheartened with their recent form and their almost annual capitulation at around this time and want a point to at least stay in the title race. 

Should we win and a draw occur between those, we're almost odds-on for finishing above Arsenal this season: they have a tougher schedule than us, plus Wenger will be desperately wanting to win the FA Cup so they at least have some silverware this season. 

EDIT: Further than that, I'd just like to point out that, at the moment, we probably have the least pressure on us in the top 6/7: Chelsea must be concerned because, regardless of what Mourinho spouts in the papers, they are favourites to win the league and, should they somehow concede that, it will be extremely painful for such an egotistical side to take. Man City have an extreme amount of pressure since they now *need* to win their three games in hand to get near Chelsea and end their season with any cup that is worth something. Arsenal have their poor run of form and capitulation worries, as well as all the injury woes that currently surround them; plus, they'll invest heavily in the FA Cup now that they're the last major team in it. Spurs, Everton and Man United are all playing to get anywhere near the CL positions, and every game counts significantly since they're not really in the race at the moment.

We, on the other hand, are doing much better than we ever anticipated, should manage to finish in CL position and have our biggest games (aside from Utd) at fortress Anfield, where we mostly dictate the play.",0,1394756073,null,0,1394756448,0,cg21mjd,t3_20cjbj,t1_cg21mjd,t3_20cjbj,null,1432790676,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Sterling is more of a dynamic player. He makes quick decisions and sees things quickly, and will act quickly.

Suso I would put on the other side in the methodical corner, much like the aforementioned David Silva, or players like Alonso or Pirlo. They take the opportunity to analyze the entire play and players within it, calculate their options and execute it in the most precise, estimated way possible.

Players like Coutinho and Gerrard fall more in the middle. While they can and do act quickly and rely on their movement, they are also capable of taking a step back, scanning the pitch and picking out the best pass/play.

I think Suso has the ability to be both a dynamic and methodical player. He has great skills on the balls and a wide range of passing ability, but his strongest tool is his mind. It's a reflection of his ability to play in several positions - as a deep lying playmaker, an attacking player/shoulder forward or a winger/wide midfielder.

true,smokey815,num11,,"How has he played to our strengths?

Today, he fielded a team with Eriksen on the left wing.  Eriksen is by far more suited to the middle, and succeeds *despite* being pushed out there, not *because* of it.  Even then, that idea can be effective.  You lose width, but it's made up for by an overlapping fullback.  Except we didn't have one of those.  He chose to field the right footed Kyle Naughton instead of Zeki Fryers, and actual left back.  

This resulting in the exact same problem we had against West Ham way back when AVB was in charge.  We basically ignore the left hand third of the pitch and voluntarily compressed ourselves into the middle and right hand channels.

Then take a look at the center of the pitch.  Early on, we showed an inability to control the ball in the center of the pitch.  Benfica were pressing well and not letting us move.  We didn't have an outlet.  We were outnumbered and swarmed in the midfield.  One fix for this would be to take off Harry Kane and add Chadli or Townsend.  They operate in the wide position, and this does two things.  First, it spreads the pitch.  We have more room to work and move.  It opens up passing lanes.  It also rectifies the situation I described before, where we were outnumbered.  

Instead of relying on a striker to drop deep at the right time, Eriksen is there.  That changes the roles Paulinho and Sandro have to perform as well.  They no longer have to get the ball from the centerbacks and move it all the way forward.  They have our most effective playmaker just ahead of them, and because the field is now effectively wider and more open, they can pick out a pass easier.  

Both of these things could be achieved at the start of the match by choosing a more balanced starting XI, or at half time by making just one change.  Two, if you want to take off Naughton as well.  

And when he did make a change, what really changed?  Swap Rose for Walker and change Naughton over to right back.  A good decision, but he left it to far too late to do.  If you were that concerned about Rose's fitness, then play Zeki.  He's shown he's got a decent enough head on his shoulders and can handle going forward well enough.

Kane for Soldado was basically a like for like.  Take off one striker for another.  Again, far too late.  You don't give Soldado nearly enough time to get into it and make an impact.  It also doesn't change anything.  We don't play any differently. We just have a different player doing the same thing.

The last sub was Bentaleb on for Sandro.  For me, he was handcuffed a bit by Sandro's yellow.  But then again, he carried that yellow for 70 whole minutes.  If he was concerned, he should have taken him off sooner.  If not, then Sandro can last ten minutes.  Bentaleb was the right man to come on, we needed his composure.  But it was too late, and once again did not solve the fact that we were outnumbered in midfield.

Please, let me know if you disagree.  I'm not trying to be a dick, or overly combative by any means.  But for me, Sherwood has done anything great, and honestly regressed lately.  The one thing I always complimented him on was the fact that he didn't shackle our players the way AVB did.

true,devilliers178,lfc68,,"if by accomplish you mean win trophies, then true. But not necessarily true if you mean become a more accomplished footballer. Torres, Bale, Henry (although passed his prime when he moved), are examples of players who benefited from having teams built around them, then left for the opportunity to win more trophies and don't have the same potency as they used to. Even Zidane could be argued to have left his best years at Juventus. Very few have improved their football by chasing trophies (Ronaldo, Ibra, Fabregas? which suggests a connection with ego).

You still have a great point and by no reason could he not improve like Ronaldo did. But Gerrard, imo, is a player who is great because he had to carry the team, needed responsibility to show his character as well as posses the technical talent that he does.

I actually think you make very good points and i appreciate how much thought you put into all of that. There isn't much i disagree with on paper, your ideas all sound wonderful. But i just don't think out team works the way that we all want it to. It would be amazing to have Danny streaking down the left opening up space for Chadli or Townsend, but it just doesn't seem like its going to work. I think we have a team full of really solid players and maybe two of them really can influence a game, but we all look at our team on paper and expect them to be amazing. Paulinho should be great for us, but he isn't. Eriksen does the best he can and he's what I'm most excited for, but it takes more than him alone for us to be a great team. We bought players in the summer that can one day be great, but aren't there yet. Thats my biggest grievance. I loved us as a club when we had exciting players like Gareth, Luka and Rafa, any one of them could take over a game. We've gone from a team with some great players that lifted the rest up and now we expect those players to stay at the levels they were at when we were at our best. There just isn't leadership on our field anymore. I honestly believe that we would have been better off keeping Scotty and Huddlestone, and even Caulker (but i don't think many people liked that we sold him). We just don't have any grit. We can't win games ugly anymore. When we do it just seems lucky. I don't believe that Tim is a tactical genius, but neither was Harry. They're motivators and I think tim was handed a shit hand and if he doesn't at least remain a part of the club at the end of the season I will be very disappointed.

I'd like more McGann as well.  Despite the campiness of the Doctor Who TV Movie, 8 was a fantastic doctor (and he was even better in Night of the Doctor - or perhaps it just seemed that way because we were so excited to see him again).  But I don't think it would fare well to interject a couple seasons of 8 right now - we've seen his story start and end, which means that there's less interest in that particular segment of the Doctor's life than the one who's ending is less certain.

Also, whenever we come up against a team or manager with an ounce of tactical knowledge we get shown up. Look at Arsenal in the cup or man city (humiliation no2). 

Yes, we are now attacking more however that has come at the expense of any form of defensive sense, even though we are playing at least one (Bentaleb?) defensive midfielder. To Tim's credit he has got ade firing again however without that he would have been shown up for what he is, a new manager who should not be running a team trying for the top 4 of the premier league.

He should have never let holtby go on loan, he should have dropped Bentaleb once sandro/paulihno were fit again. No wonder some of out bigger names look disheartened, would you want to stay at a team that has no sense of direction and an amateur coach?

I think sometimes in games where Sturridge has been out and Suarez is alone up front excellent defensive teams have an easier time limiting a player like Suarez than one like Torres. Should be interesting to see how this plays out if we secure CL football for next year when we come up against the very best sides in Europe. However, in his favor Suarez is far more consistent, works much harder than Torres ever did, and has the desire to win at all costs every single game, whereas Torres sometimes would come out flat for games. Different players, different strengths and weaknesses. Can't wait to see if Suarez can replicate what he's done in the PL this season on Europe's biggest stage against sides like RM and Barca like Torres did in his first couple of years with us.

Santander 321 account (really needs to be managed like a current account due to cash back)

Halifax rewards £5 every month as long as you pay in £750 and have two direct debits out.

seriously wants any of those jobs listed on the
title?



The way I see it, a job is a job. A career doesn't just fall into your lap. And yes, on the first level, that is all the jobs hiring frequently. Very few people want to make a career out of answering phones or cleaning toilets, but you know what, you have to start somewhere and if you can't get on to any graduate scheme you may just have to take a dose of humility and do shit you don't want to do. Fresh out of uni I had two part time jobs, cleaning and stockroom stuff, and it was awful. I moved up to admin - which yes is dull as shit, but it can pay marginally better and be marginally more satisfying than doing nothing - and now that I've got a few years experience I'm applying myself to things I actually wanted to do. I recently contacted a publishing house, even though I have no experience, and they want to talk to me. 

Take a cleaning job. Volunteer in your local area. Learn how to sell yourself and your talents in a CV and interview. I know it's frustrating and at times scary, but there are ways out of the hole you're in, you've just got to be prepared to start right at the bottom if nothing else is working.

And I'd be interested to know which countries these are, because of the five I've lived in (UK, UAE, Oman, Italy, Philippines), every single one had a daily limit on the ATM.

They don't set these limits just to piss you off, they set them to protect both their own liabilities, and the general stupidity of people who want to do anything and everything, and then will moan the loudest when something bad happens.

true,greekgeek31337,null,null,"I do agree with, and share, your criticism of today's CS BSc and MSc (post)graduates mostly being unable to code a single line of code.

I should, however, point out that computer programming has always been a profession that was pretty much 90% self-taught. Let's face it, if you've never written a line of code before you went to uni, you were/are/will be lucky to learn how to actually code by the time you've finished (UNLESS  you spent your degree time coding day &amp; night) your course.

Having said that, what I personally got out of uni (cohort of 1999 - 2004) in the subject of coding was knowledge of a number of things such as Software Engineering, Software Development principles and methodologies, and research methodologies that can aid and inform software development. And, guess what... Not only did those VERY long hours studying s/w devel models and principles help me code MUCH better, but I found the skills transferrable across various sectors.

Ask a graduate or someone who is self-taught what is ""Design by Contract"", and they'll most likely ask if its edible or some kind of drug. And, yet, they code mission-critical stuff... Look at the code some/certain ""professional"" software developers (may the deity of your choice make them so) write, and its all bling and no substance, has no comments, is never properly designed or documented (or even thought out), never properly debugged and never properly tested.

Unless one is a Linux kernel developer, of course, but they too end up learning a lot of all that (after a good public flogging in the kernel mailing lists or IRC).

And of those who maintain that (having) a university education is worth nothing to them or their companies, I would ask to not tar everybody with the same brush. There are (post)graduates who don't know how to write a ""Hello World!"", and there are (post)graduates who will blossom into great assets (assuming they survive the office politics) if you give them 1/4th of a chance.

And certainly don't lambast development methodologies just because you ""think"" they have no worth to businesses. I have yet to see a business that properly follows even a simplified Waterfall model. I have, however, seen plenty of businesses who (to use a colloquialism) ""diss"" coders who have degrees or who think ""academic"" development methodologies have no merit. They usually appear in the news relating to ""massive data breaches"".

PS: I do get 3-4 recruiters calling about Agile S/w devel jobs every month, so Agile is not quite dead yet (unfortunately).
PPS: Universities are not learning centres (and I have nothing against LCs). Their purpose has, historically, never been to prepare people to enter the workforce, but to give them an all around (BSc)/more specific (MSc)/specialised (PhD) knowledge of their chosen field and to aid our understanding of the world around us.

true,davidsmeaton,lfc68,,"For those who don't feel like clicking through 10 pages:

**No.10: Steven Gerrard (September 19, 2010)**

Dimitar Berbatov's double had Roy Hodgson's Reds deflated, but Gerrard notched a penalty to restore hope. Then the skipper drew level with this beauty and recreated his famous camera-kiss celebration. Sadly, Berbatov completed his hat-trick to seal a 3-2 win.

***

**No.9: Fernando Torres (March 22, 2010)**

This barnstorming Liverpool breakaway came after just five minutes of play to silence the home crowd. Dirk Kuyt's cross was precise and Torres' header was sublime. Unfortunately for the visitors, this game slipped from within their grasp, as United came back to win 2-1.

***

**No.8: Fernando Torres (March 14, 2009)**

Liverpool, hoping to keep dreams of a title challenge alive, trailed at Old Trafford, thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty. However, Torres seized on Nemanja Vidic's indecision, raced forward to level the scores from a narrow angle and set the ball rolling on arguably our greatest win over the Red Devils.

***

**No.7: Robbie Fowler (October 1, 1995)**

This match was supposed to be all about the return of Eric Cantona. And while the Frenchman grabbed an assist and a goal during the typically tense 2-2 draw, it was Fowler who stole the show. Below is the Scouser's first of the game - an absolute missile of a strike from range.

***

**No.6: Fabio Aurelio (March 14, 2009)**

Liverpool's slender 2-1 advantage at Old Trafford was about to get a whole lot bigger. Vidic had been shown a red card for hauling Gerrard to the floor, and no sooner had United's Serbian departed the pitch, Aurelio curled a ferocious strike to put daylight between the sides.

***

**No.5: Danny Murphy (December 17, 2000)**

Liverpool are currently without an Old Trafford win for five years; however, before this game at the turn of the century, the Reds had waited a decade to taste victory in the league. That was until Murphy, calm as you like, whipped this phenomenal strike around the wall to end the hoodoo and grab a narrow 1-0 win.

***

**No.4: Patrik Berger (March 4, 2000)**

The curl and swerve on this strike, which bent around the wall en route to the bottom corner of the United net, is good as any you'll see. Throw in the distance of the effort and it's clear why we chose this as one of our most brilliant goals at Old Trafford.

***


**No.3: Andrea Dossena (March 14, 2009)**

Talk about rubbing salt into the wounds. Talk about sheer elation in the travelling section of the ground. Substitute full-back, Dossena, demonstrated all the poise and precision of a world-class striker when he lobbed, on the half-volley, over Edwin van der Sar to seal a remarkable 4-1 win.

***

**No.2: Danny Murphy (January 22, 2002)**

Murphy struck again in front of a stunned Old Trafford to clinch a 1-0 victory. This one was beautifully executed and made all the more sweeter by the fact it came late in the game. With six minutes remaining, Gerrard's pin-point pass picked him out and Murphy's lobbed finish was exquisite.

***

**No.1 Robbie Fowler (October 1, 1995)**

We saw Fowler's first of this 2-2 thriller earlier in our countdown. But we think, as good as the other one was, this one's better. Watch Robbie brush Gary Neville aside before calmly chipping over the 'keeper - Peter Schmeichel no less - with consumate ease and utter precision.

***

My personal top 3 - Dossena, Torres (robbing Vidic), and Burger.

By free banking I mean we do not pay to simply have a bank account, yes, we get charges for sending money overseas, it is all part and parcel of banking, we have always had it this way and we would rather have it that way than get SEPA and International fees for free and have to pay to simply HAVE a bank account, especially as most people do not use SEPA or International Banking etc.

BUt Hey, let me do your research for you since you prefer to spend your time ranting here about how BAD we brits have it banking wise....


lets check [Barclays](http://www.barclays.co.uk/Helpsupport/Internationalpayments/P1242593395280)

Oh look.... 

&gt;If you're making a payment in euros to an account in the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) – the 27 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – you may prefer to make a SEPA credit transfer.

&gt;It's cheaper than using our International Payment Service but your payment may take a little longer to arrive. You will also need the SWIFT Bank Identifier Code (BIC) and the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) of the account to which you are sending the money.

But wait, you said we CHARGE for these services OK lets look at the small print...

&gt;These only apply when you choose to 'pay all charges'. Cover bank and overseas delivery charges may be requested by foreign banks involved in the transfer. The charges are fees imposed by the foreign bank to process your payment. The amount of these charges can vary from country to country and even from bank to bank.

&gt;Please note that if you’re sending pound sterling, you won’t know the exchange rate being used by the receiving bank.

He has won me around 100%. It's not just down to results though. The way he came into the club and seemed to agree with the fans that we needed to cut the deadweight from the McCarthy/Saunders era (I won't include Stale here, because he wasn't here near long enough to judge him). Every time I saw someone like Henry, Ward, Johnson go, my expectations rose. He has crafted a brand new squad, where I believe our oldest starting 11 player is Sam Ricketts with nobody else being over the age of 27. We have a young, hungry team who actually seem to be proud to play for Wolverhampton Wanderers. 

When you think back to last season, and look at our squad now, we have Sako, Ikeme and Stearman, with nobody else being in the starting 11 (save Dave Edwards, who I still rate in this league). We have a group of players who have had to gel into a new club: (Ricketts, Goldbourne, Henry, Jacobs, Dicko, Clarke) as well as some fantastic youth who have shown what they can do given the chance (Price, Batth).

I'm so happy to be a Wolves fan nowadays. I've been to more games this season than previous (i now have the money to justify it!) and the atmosphere around the ground has been phenomenal.

Updates: 

* Arsenal and City's exit from Champion's league being an advantage or disadvantage depends on us. Still have to face Galatasaray.

* Table is fake because of missing matches.

* Man City and Arsenal had enough quality to get through. Man City has the ability to win all 3 matches in hand. Supports the English teams and was not happy when they were out of the competition. 

* Doesn't how many points will be required to win the league.

* 3 points tomorrow would be great, 1 isn't a bad result.

*Its mainly question after question about being top of the table so a lot of repeating himself*

* To be calm and relaxed is the best way to be.

* 04/05 and 05/06 was just Chelsea and United. Now 4 teams can win it.

* Cole and Luiz aren't fit. Torres is much better.

* Our squad is quite short. 2 missing for champion's league and Van Ginkel injured. Difficult to cope with both the Champion's league and premier league.

* Ahead of schedule on getting Chelsea where he wants them.

* Doesn't know on Torres recovery. Might take him tomorrow.

* Sam deserves manager of the month. Hazard to reach March without a player of the month makes him laugh.

* Benfica played very well against spurs. Even Sherwood said they were the best team.

* The title in Portugal is under control by Benfica.

* Doesn't know who Jose Riga is.

* Bertrand has a future at Chelsea and an important past. Maybe next season he is with us.

Fin.

This is my number one problem with both Paulinho and Dembele, as I've said before. Their work rate in the transitional phases of play are appalling. Paulinho was literally walking around for a good deal of the time we were attempting to move the ball out from the back. He was not working at all to receive the ball and get it moving. Dembele in my opinion has the exact same problem and really can only be bothered to try when he receives the ball near the final third. Neither of them can be bothered to put in the effort into the maintenance of possession and the transitioning of play. If they're playing together, it isn't pretty. That is why I have been a fan of Bentaleb since his debut. He works hard to get on the ball in all phases of the game and works to maintain possession at all costs and has been successful in doing so. He consistantly has one of the highest passing percentages on the team, most successful passes and usually chips in a fair amount with interceptions, tackles and ball retrievals.

true,catfishmaw,eng-yorkshire,Leeds Lad Living in London,"Benn's legacy will likely rest largely on his diaries, and his activism after 1988. I like to remember him as a multifaceted man. He effected constitutional change, but over an irrelevance in British life. He democratised the structure of the Labour Party, but doing so inadvertently gave legitimacy to Militants, and eventually gifted the party to the centre-right. In Cabinet, he modernised industry, but the white heat of the 1964 revolution turned out to be largely hot air.

None of which is criticise the words, actions or convictions of the man himself. Tony Benn was a person of unquestionable integrity. I can't think of anyone in British politics like him. But reverence of him should include appreciation of his contradictions. He was born into the Wedgwood-Darwin dynasty of Liberal aristocrats, but painted himself a democratic socialist man-of-the-people.

Some highlights from an incomparable life:

* [Losing to a Conservative candidate in the 1983 General Election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8og8IRthWk&amp;index=19&amp;list=PL08442FD79A2C3456) by a very narrow margin, despite constituency border changes which favoured the Conservatives (note how the winning candidate acknowledges his ""great courage"");
* [This affectionate caricature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSv3PNBHCBM) of Benn from the last episode of Spitting Image's first series, in 1984;
* A [one-off documentary Benn made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeNL2UUGyog), mostly covertly and with a handheld camera, called Westminster: Behind Closed Doors, for the BBC in 1995;
* A [2007 extended GMTV interview with Roy Hattersley and David Owen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e9QjpWboIo), offering a rare glimpse into the world of the Labour Party in the 1970s. The three, approximating the radical left, the original ascendent right, and the breakaway radical right of the party, have out their various disagreements, and assess Wilson's and Callaghan's legacies.


For those lamenting the death of parliamentary socialism, I would direct your attention to the extra-parliamentary (and often anarchist rather than statist) hard left activism still visible around the country, and especially in South London.

All I see from Holtby is energy, he runs around like a chicken on speed... but time and time again finds himself isolated, because he never presses as a team member, and runs into areas where he had no real chance of progressing the play. 

On the ball he is decent technically, but I see him making so many mistakes- whilst the same could certainly be said for Barkley, I see much more of a shining light in Rossy (and he is a good few years younger). I have a problem with any player who is always credited first with 'working hard', he is a professional footballer, that should be a given- can we have some actual tangible skills now?

I hear he was pretty good in Germany, but in England I have failed to see him live up to any of the supposed hype. For me, someone like Bradley Johnson is twice the player Holtby is(for a Pienaar replacement), and would be 1/5th of the price. Perhaps Holtby has more potential, but that may never come to fruition.

At least the richest Americans tend to have actually made products and services like Bill Gates etc. (although he had dodgy business practices and started with a comfortable background that gave him enough capital to do it).

The inspector hung a ""do not use"" notice on the thing, but said there's nothing he can do to stop us continuing to use it, so we did. At the end of the day, it's the only way of providing hot food, so if you know you can use it and not blow yourselves up, so be it. That's completely unofficial, BTW.

If the landlord provides the cooker, it's their responsibility to replace it. Our landlord offered to replace it, but also said they'd look the other way if we got our own and had the old one taken away by the scrap metal dudes who cruise our neighbourhood three times daily, so that's what we did. Only cost £80 thanks to having couple of refurbished white goods shops nearby. 

Fitted it myself, because it's nothing more than a bayonet hose.

Next inspection, not a second glance at shiny new gas cooker, confirmed installation perfectly fine.

We refuse to use a lot of gas because we had a Carbon Monoxide incident a few years back, so it scares us. So to minimise gas usage for cooking, we have a halogen oven and a health grill. Both together cost under £60 and can cook 90% of what you can shove in your cooker. We don't have a microwave.

If we also got an electric hob, (cheapest currently £45 from Argos), I don't think we'd need the gas cooker at all, and with all three, you're still looking at something like £100 less than a brand new gas cooker.

I'd beg to differ. Most of our close allies were involved in Iraq and Afghanistan themselves. Whilst it's been politically messy and most states involved found Iraq and Afghanistan unpopular domestically, key allies partook and as a result understand why it was deemed necessary.

My story... not a problem, I'll tell you what I remember. It's a weird one! 

I was in my second year of University living in my first student house outside of halls. I and about 10 other friends were heading to a local club and had been drinking at home to prepare. We'd had a bit of a cocktail of stuff - I was steaming nicely. 

The walk from our house to the club is about 10 / 15 minutes down some fairly quiet roads. I was walking at the front of our group chatting to a mate. 

On the other side of the road a man and a woman were walking in the opposite direction to us. The man was carrying shopping bags in each hand. We didn't acknowledge or engage them in any way. 

They crossed the street and were walking straight towards my group. I'm hazy on the details but before they reached us (about a metre or two away, I wasn't paying them any attention) they stopped. This is where it gets weird.. 

..The woman bear-hugs me (her arms pinning my arms to my sides) and the guy behind her drops his shopping bags and punches me in the face - twice - breaking my nose. 

I go down (but not unconscious, just knocked over - but pretty dazed with all that alcohol sloshing about). My friends - I think - were not really paying attention so nobody really has time to react to this. 

By a blind stroke of luck two police riot vans happen to come around the corner of the road and catch sight of everything going on. They immediately stop and arrest the man and woman before they've even left. 

The next thing *I* know I'm sat on a garden wall, an ambulance crew arrives to tend to my wounds and recommends I head home. A couple of my mates walk me home and I go to sleep.. and that's it. 

The guy was ordered to pay me about £100 in compensation and I believe was given some short custodial sentence as well. That's all that ever came of it and to this day I have no idea who they were or what prompted the attack (I can't even say I looked at them funny or engaged them in any way).

If we do in fact bring in LvG my hope is less for new players but that he can instil a philosophy at the club from the top down. Look no further than Swansea what a club philosophy can do for a club.  They stick to the philosophy and each new manager (Martinez, Rodgers, Laudrop and even it looks like Gary Monk) brings their own spin on how to work it but the philosophy doesn't change, the senior squad and the youth squad abide by it and the club all march to one tune.  

The result is that a team that has very little money has been in the PL and competed in the Europa league and this season despite having a poor season are still likely to remain mid-table.

Now consider what we could do as a club if we had a ethos that rolled from the top down guided by someone like LvG at the start before turning  over the reigns to another manager. It helps the club identify new management candidates and players who fit the system. 

Everyone talks about having a manager take the reigns for 5-10 years and stabilize the club. Its a wonderful idea, but in modern football it is sadly almost an antiquated idea, there is so much money involved that clubs will chase managers and managers/players will jump clubs at the blink of an eye.  However, you can build stability in a club if you buy into a system from the top down, look at Swansea or better yet look at Ajax or Barca (or from US sports the Patriots) managers and players come and go but the philosophy remains and the club remains effective at is play on the field. 

In the short term LvG could clear house, we could see a group of players from the continent come in and replace our current players but its the long term potential that LvG could bring that is really appealing.",0,1394795278,null,0,false,0,cg2cuuf,t3_20e6km,t1_cg2cuuf,t3_20e6km,null,1432796035,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

When I started running a company, just selling my services and a few bits I could automate on a computer, I didn't care for the accounting, it was a pain, far to much to learn.

Then I got hit hard when I had to buy out my flat mate, I'd been keeping the money in the company, saving so I could do something a bit more ambitious, but suddenly it became apparent I needed this cash so my friend could move out and be married.  I ended up being taxed at 67% of a bunch of it.  If I'd paid more attention, I could have simply borrowed from the bank, waited 3 months, and I'd have paid much less tax.  I'm not rich, I wasn't born with money, I feel it's incredibly unfair all these people have *wealth*, yet I earning money, to have a small 2 bed flat, get taxed at 67%.   It really drove me nuts.  Also made me decide to work less hard for a bit and take a year off!

I have a feeling that they're banning anything LGBT because it's an old ban on an misunderstood group.

If they're banned because they want a rainbow float instead of a green one then ban away. If they're being banned because they're trying to take away from the spirit of the holiday then go for it.

ENIC are currently undertaking a project which will result in the greatest growth our club will have seen in the past hundred years at a cost of 400 million pounds so to say ENIC is not investing is ridiculous. Rather than investing in a depreciating (economically speaking) stock of players what Levy is doing is expanding our revenue base for the future so that Spurs can afford to purchase and pay required players from income rather than the repeated capital injections that unsustainably fund other clubs. We are breaking even on transfer fees which is a GOOD thing. We are not a buying club. Not yet. But it means that Levy is reinvesting the funds received for when other clubs inevitably overpay for our players. He buys ridiculously low and sells incredibly high. This is how we can be in the running for CL without having the global support and income of the other contending clubs.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"There is a very good argument that we actually are sitting right about where we should be if not actually punching a bit above our weight.

In modern football sadly money is a massive influence on success. City and Chelsea have oil rich owners willing to break the bank to guarantee on the field success. United are one of the three most valuable clubs on the planet. Arsenal pumped it money into paying off its new stadium and have bought into the idea of being a sustainable business as well as a productive football club. LFC have rich owners who are looking to turn a profit but also have shown a willingness to spend if it improves the on the field performance.  

United, Chelsea, LFC and Arsenal (City's is growing as well) all have massive, massive worldwide support that pumps money into their clubs non stop. The fan base of these clubs is significantly higher than Spurs in Asia and North America, essentially they have a license to print money from merchandise and more importantly television (these clubs get to license their own broadcast rights in Asia and the Middle East) around the world.

Spurs don't spend outrageously (even this summer with the £100m our net spend was negligible), we are built to be a sustainable business and club.

As much as we want to say we are on the level of the big boys, we haven't gotten there yet. We are acutally much closer to Everton and have been for quite some time.

Look at Spurs and Everton from the 00/01 season forward we have had an average finishing position of 8th, Everton have averaged 9th. Both clubs have qualified for the CL 1 time....now lets just look at the past 5 years Spurs have averaged finishing 5th and Everton 7th the average difference in points between Spurs and Everton in the past 5 years has been 5 points.  For all our success we aren't very far off from where Everton sit and they spend even less money that we do.

Now we have aspirations of being a continual CL competitor, Levy has set this expectation to the fans. I don't think Levy is without blame, i don't think he has adapted to his own expectations. He still doesn't seem to have moved his mentality to a CL contender.

There are about 4 ways to become a continual CL competitor, Spend your way in, have a great manager, spend and have a great manager or invent a new way. We are never going to spend like the Manchesters or Chelsea. As an organization we don't seem to have the sense of inovation to invent a new way into the CL...so that leaves coaching, we haven't had a great coach to go along with our talent. 

Levy is not without fault, but our supporters expectations are out of line with where we actually are as a club. Levy gets plenty of flack (there are apparently people bringing the ""Levy Out"" banners to the upcoming home matches), but in the grand scheme of things, despite his faults, we are amazingly lucky to have someone like Levy in charge. Go watch *The Four Year Plan* to understand what a nutter of an owner can do to a club. Go ask Pompey fans what it is like for your owner to gamble to the future of the club on short term success. 

As a group of supporters we are just as guilty of overstating our expectations as Levy, we naturally want short term success, we want CL football, cups, glory....but we need to remember that the club is built on what amounts to a 20-year plan (consistent performance on the pitch, new training ground, new stadium etc) not a 4 year plan.

Politics aside (and my politics are very much to the side of Cameron's), I sort of feel he's fundamentally unlikeable. A career politician whose only job before becoming an MP was as a PR man for a TV company, and who markets himself as the future of the Conservative Party, despite having been a junior minister under Major, and having written Michael Howard's 2005 election manifesto. A man whose idea of a good time when he was younger was to take a buttload of coke with a bunch of his uber-rich hooligan friends, and destroy respectable establishments.

Not to mention someone who uses the very human and naturally sympathetic story of his son as a distraction in the argument about whether or not he's privatised the NHS.

He is perceived by voters to be the most credible leader of a political party (and therefore the first choice for Prime Minister for most people).

Coutinho can come on for Allen if we need to chase the game, or Lucas can come on for anyone if we need to tighten things up.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"I firmly believe that we haven't seen what the players can do. Tim didn't play any of our summer signings against Chelsea, and let's be honest with each other; do you really believe Bentaleb is better than Capoue or Paulinho? More talented?

I'm not asking if you feel that he ""cares more"" or is ""playing harder"", but is he more talented. Because making them ""caring more"" is Tim's job - he has to motivate the players. And I see a team that has no interest in playing together, a team that doesn't listen to their manager, and I can't blame them.

For weeks now we've heard how Soldado trains so hard, works his tail off in training... And he got held off the field last night for Harry Kane. No offense to Harry, I actually thought he played well, but he's no Bobby Soldier.

And players like Sandro and Paulinho, who are established internationals, even Capoue who's a good player, are being held off the field by Bentaleb, because ""he cares more"". Meanwhile, Dembele is being forced to play way out of position, Andros, Gylfi and Nacer can't get a game, and Eriksen, despite looking our best player every time he plays, can't get regular games.

This last part is both the most worrying and most damning, and I think has a lot to do with Vertonghen's mental state. It's no secret that he and Eriksen are close, and that Jan wears his heart on his sleeve. I think Jan's had it out with Sherwood over Eriksen not playing (again, Nabil has played more matches than Eriksen this last month. It's not because there are more talented players) and Tim presumably didn't take Jan's challenge lightly. I think the same is true of Nacer, and lord only knows where Gylfi has gone - haven't seen him in weeks.

My point is; Tim has tinkered with formations in completely silly ways that suggest he's not interested in playing certain players, and has sidelined established, talented internationals in favor of reserve players and youth team guys. That's not going to show us how good this team is, or how talented our players are.

Tim's clearly lost the dressing room, and until he goes, I don't think we can make any real evaluation of the talent of our signings.

Two questions: 

1. What job are you looking for?

2. Where else are you looking to find it?

What you are looking for will make a huge difference to where you should look. You want to be a headteacher? Get the teaching suppliments, they definitely won't be advertised on Universal Jobmatch and you will certainly need many years experience in the field, all of the relevant qualifications and all of the necessary CRB checks.

Want to work in motorsport? Buy a motorsport magazine, there are at least two pages filled with jobs in most of them. (Autosport certainly does), but yeah, you will need to have relevant qualifications and experience, you can't get a job as an F1 mechanic straight out of senior school.

Got no qualifications, or experience and don't want to do the jobs listed in your title? Get a job in a pub, or a garden centre. Go to businesses and hand a cv in, ask if they have any jobs going, take an application form and get to it.

true,BoltenMoron,num11,,"I understand your frustration, I am frustrated too. Let me clarify and say that if you are content then you may as well pull up stumps and go home. It is critical that we are ambitious. I want us to win the title, I want us to go deep in the Champions League. I want to see Spurs lift trophies. I agree that just because we are no longer relegation fodder does not mean we should not be trying to push higher and higher. What I am saying is that we cannot achieve that next level without increased revenue and responsible fiscal management. You can gamble on buying a CL place but for every City there is a Leeds, Portsmouth or Blackburn. 

I personally don't believe that the owners shouldn't pour their own money into the club to buy success. Levy doesn't do this but ENIC hasn't exactly stripped the club of assets either. It is in their best interests for Spurs to win also. We are in a transitional period. We have gotten from the bottom to the cusp of the top. That next step is a big one if we are to get there and stay there. Lets be real about this. If we want success as fans then we are going to have to pay for some of it. Sponsorship will pay for the rest and Levy recently negotiated our largest ever shirt sponsorship deal ever.

true,catfishmaw,eng-yorkshire,Leeds Lad Living in London,"You've missed the distinction.

There is such a thing as the interests of working people. And there is another, separate thing, which is the interests of those involved in big business.

""Business,"" in the context above, is a metonym which refers to ""those members of the financial elite who make executive business decisions, and stand to make large profits from preferential public policy."" If someone claims that Thatcher/Major sought the interests of business over the interests of the people, they might have in mind the privatisation of the National Coal Board between 1984 and 1994, which culminated in the loss of millions of workers' jobs, and huge profits for the newly formed corporation, UK Coal.

Even the neoliberals and Monetarists who ran that government, and who serve as apologists for its legacy, observe the distinction you fail to acknowledge. They explicitly state that the role of economic policy should be to limit inflation, and not to abolish unemployment. The former policy increases the efficiency of industry, and generates profit for big business. The latter is a matter of equality and social justice. Thus, one is in the interests of business, and another is in the interests of the people.

All of this would be true even if every person in the UK was employed by a business, which they are not. (And which they decidedly were not, before 1979, when the wind changed.)",1,1394805005,null,0,false,0,cg2f4u3,t3_20dxi8,t1_cg2f4u3,t1_cg2dp96,null,1432797108,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'd put it down to the purity of the legal highs around at that time, I think the average street seizure of 4MMC was about 86% pure or more.  Compared to the ridiculous level of purity found in cocaine, amphetamine and ecstasy on the street.

These newer synthetic cannaboids are really dangerous though, the original 'Spice' with JWH/WIN compounds in it were reasonably bad but nothing compared to the new ones now.

Its sorta interesting that whenever there are a large amount of deaths attributed to a research chemical ( like 4MMC and 5-IAI ) it usually comes from Sweden which has some really draconian drug laws.",0,1394805665,null,0,1394863979,0,cg2fcv7,t3_20e58f,t1_cg2fcv7,t3_20e58f,null,1432797218,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The [Marine Broadcasting Offences Act] made it almost impossible for the likes of Radio Caroline to keep going and paved the way for the launch of Radio 1 in September of the same year.

From the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Caroline)

&gt;Radio Caroline is a British radio station founded in 1964 by Ronan O'Rahilly to circumvent the record companies' control of popular music broadcasting in the United Kingdom and the BBC's radio broadcasting monopoly

&gt;When Marine &amp;c. Broadcasting Offences Act become law on 14 August 1967, Radio Caroline was renamed Radio Caroline International. Six weeks later, the BBC introduced its new national pop station Radio 1, modelled largely on the successful offshore station, Radio London, and employed many of the ex-pirate DJs.

Exceeding the speed limit and 'travelling too fast for the conditions' attributed towards 420 fatal accidents in 2011. Still a high number, but small in the general scheme of what causes accidents.

Driver/rider error or reaction (such as failing to look properly, junction overshoots, loss of control, etc) contributed towards 1122 fatal accidents in 2011.

Failing to look properly is the main cause of accidents, and has actually increased from 35 per cent of accidents in 2007 to 42 per cent in 2011.

Speeding is naturally causing less and less accidents due to cars being safer and breaking systems getting better, whereas general idiocy just as failing to look properly is getting worse. There are a number of studies that show speed cameras don't do a whole lot, but I take any speed camera study with a pinch of salt.

All in all, our money needs to be spent on making and training people to pay more fucking attention on the roads, making the driving tests significantly harder, and potential retests every decade after you pass your test.

When he finally left I felt like I let out a breath I'd been holding for his entire run. It felt like relaxing my muscles for the first time after having been angry and tense all day. It felt like being told ""it's not cancer"". 

Because I found him nothing but irritating at *any* point. Grind my teeth, have to restrain myself from putting my hands over my ears irritating. I tried my best to like him, and right now I'm racking my brains trying to think of a single moment he wasn't *actively* irritating me, and failing. There were some good stories in his seasons, all of them made worse by his presence.

Matt was a clown, not the Doctor. He was a caricature of Eccleston and Tennant's silliest moods. He had no range; his only mode was flailing, hammy loudness. When he tried to do serious scenes, I could only see hammy irritating Matt Smith trying his best to reign himself in like a little boy trying not to giggle at a funeral or minute's silence on veteran's day.

Holy *shit* thank fuck he's gone. Holy SHIT. *exhale* I think his Doctor ranks as the worst portrayal of anyone I've ever seen in anything, except maybe the actors in that Lemon Stealing Whore joke porno. I don't know what he's like in anything else - the only other thing I've seen him in was ""In Bruges"" and he only appears in a short deleted scene - and I never want to. I don't think I can ever unsee him not being the Doctor. The sight of him, the sound of his voice, just returns me to a tensed-up, teeth-grinding, breath-holding desire for it to be over as soon as possible.

When I left uni with a postgrad degree, my first job was a teaching assistant that was barely a living wage (it was part time which was a killer with rent), and my second job was working in an insurance call centre. They were both low paid, and the call centre job was long hours of monotonous work, but they eventually paid off and set me up for a more rewarding career. It did take a couple of years to get into a 'decent' area (for want of a better phrase), and I couldn't have done it without the experience from two seemingly unrelated jobs. 

What kind of job are you ultimately looking for? Admin is a great way to start at the bottom of the ladder; administrators know everyone and everything, and it's a good role to try out a few skills before you start going down a full career path. You can be available to volunteer for projects, learn the ins and outs of processes, and make some great contacts.

With Jesus we've been on the spotlight several times and not for the good reasons. No matter how good we perform (and I admit I, myself was surprised with our performance last night in WHL) we can't let a manager that has been around for 4 years taint what has been our history for over 100. 


I wouldn't see us as main contenders, we have the potential to reach the final, same as you, Porto, Napoli, Juve and Valencia for example. There are good teams still in the competition and it isn't over until the referee whistles on the 2nd leg so anything can happen. Obviously I'm confident, I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't but last year we reached May being 1st in the League, we reached the EL final and the Portuguese Cup final and we managed to lose everything.

true,b00ks,num30,Sandro,"America doesn't have the geographic problem that europe does.. We don't really have to segregate our fans, because people from Denver rarely fly to games in New York.. and the ones that do are usually respectful and respected by fans of the opposing teams. To add to that, most large cities don't have more than one sports team of the same sport (there are obvious examples of this not being the case, but its a general rule).  If cities do, it is usually a more good natured ribbing than an all out assault of fans.  Mets and Yankees, Raiders and 49ers, clippers and lakers. etc etc.  



Obviously this isn't always the case... the guy who got beat senseless at an Oakland game a few years back (baseball none the less.. ) and probably other examples.. but we don't have a history of firms or old rivalries that have some sort of weird historic connotations.

*edit*

One other thing that needs to be mentioned is the inherit nature of identity.  For the most part, America is America.. and americans are americans.  We seem to have a loyalty and unabashed love of patriotism.  Other countries have that as well, but our leagues are primarily played in America (and some time in Canada), and games mean a little bit more for nationalistic pride in europe than they do here... since Texas is super far away from Seattle, but we are all American.

Sort of hard to convey what I mean in this last edit, but I think at the end of the day we all identify as red blooded americans who love *insert sport here* that this bond is deeper than who we root for.

But the individual Television networks and content that are broadcast on things such as Liverpool TV....LFC just signed on with 9 different broadcast partners in January that will allow them to broadcast recent matches as well as other content around the world.  This is something all the teams are able to do on their own. LFC and Chelsea have been quite aggressive in doing so of late and LFC has even argued that they should be able to negotiate the rights to live Liverpool matches in foreign markets (both the PL and the UK government slammed this as a incredibly bad idea) as they feel they should get a bigger cut as they draw more viewers than say Hull or Cardiff.

The TV rights to the club content are valuable and more importantly serve to raise club profile in other markets. Chelsea, United, Arsenal, LFC (and increasingly City) far outstrip Spurs in overseas awareness and following....we are making massive in roads in the US (Dempsey, partnering with MLS teams and the 49ers and the NBC broadcasting of the PL helped) and Asia (our Asia Tour and new sponsorship deal with AIA) but because of the history and level of success of clubs like United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and the effort they put into growing their (and i hate this term) ""Brand Awareness"" we are well behind....they are able to generate much more revenue from overseas than we are and are continually looking at ways to grow it even further which feeds into their marketability which increases sponsorship deals, advertising revenue and merchandise sales.  

So you are correct, the live PL matches get split by all teams and is a healthy chunk of money.

I appreciate the logic you've used and I like the optimism a lot, but surely the mark of an advanced civilisation is that we now respect the past more than they did? It's not like we're struggling to move for ancient Roman remains. The preservation of archaeological sites alongside modern cities quite simply makes a more interesting modern civilisation to live in, and they're rare enough that this is hardly going to set a precedent preventing new construction *anywhere*. It's quite a rare site. Preservation also makes perfect economic sense for a city like Winchester that depends completely on historic tourism... 

The natural conclusion of your argument is that there should be no legal obstruction to someone who wants to knock down Stonehenge and build houses. Clearly historic sites do have tangible societal value. Even if this plot doesn't get built on and became grassy public land, Winchester would benefit more than from fourteen tiny new-build flats. 

If *nothing* else, can't it at least be excavated by archaeologists and relocated to a museum? Instead of being broken up for foundation hardcore?  
That's what happened when the UK's oldest bridges - wooden piers across the river, dating back to about the same era as Stonehenge -  [were found nearby on the River Test estuary](http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/book/export/html/354). That was also on a construction project, they were uncovered by accident by bulldozers excavating a reservoir for Southern Water. The net result was meticulous inspection, removal of each timber, and now they are preserved well enough that the carpentry marks and techniques can be clearly seen - not burned as firewood, which is the equivalent to what this builder wants to do by smashing the Roman defences up for construction rubble. And once several beautiful tools and other artefacts had been removed from the mud, the reservoir got built anyway.

The 1999 House of Lords Act got rid of most hereditary peers, and left only a handful in office based on their 'commitment' (read: they actually sat in the House of Lords on a regular basis anyway, and treated it basically as their full-time job).

I understand the wish for reform, and so do many others; the 1999 Act was only ever meant to be temporary. However, every subsequent vote on an idea of what to replace it with has failed in Parliament. No 'solution' has ever even come close to getting off the ground.

From a purely practical perspective, if you changed the House of Lords to being fully elected, you would also likely have to change its day-to-day job. Not many first-day politicians really aim to sit around amending/approving bills all day as their primary job. Similarly, it raises interesting questions about legitimacy; if both 'houses' are fully elected, which should legitimately have more power, and make decisions regarding what subjects?

He's left, lost and alone. An army of skinny armed hacks jump on the bandwagon to score easy points behind laptop screens who's internet history belies the falsity and poverty of their liberalism. The Lad is a sports science ubermencsh, but hes in need of his Zarathustra. Not to follow. To justify him. To elucidate his aims and his masculinity in an effeminate world. For the modern British douchebag will march on regardless.

Still, they need someone to embolden their deeds. They need someone to place them on a pedestal and deify them, and in terms of the Old Gods so that the people may understand.

This is not an attack on the polemical hack that poured bile onto man and manliness. Since it is not fair to expect such bravery often, or indeed ever, of the sort that we need today. The sort of bravery to say “this jaundiced compassion will be the end of the world,” and mean it. The sort of bravery to say “I understand the power and the focus of drinking and fucking,” in a world that recoils in the face of hetro-male sexuality.

Where is the preened, poison penned savant to go and shine through the years, unselfconsciously wielding his phallic biro? Better yet, pounding and smashing away at his keyboard, taking the fight to the new e-battlegrounds – to send a nuclear weapon into the blogosphere to bring an end to dogmatic dog-fights and silence unloved 14-year old fat girls with silly ideas? Where is this generation's Nietzsche, Mencken, Sartre? Where are our controversialists and free-thinkers, who stand atop the edifices built in the place of destroyed ideologies and laugh and beat their chests at the poxy Continentals? Who will rise up and out and become the first to put his toned body into the firing line and rip away at the flaccid philosophical foundations of 21st Century feminism and intellectual slavery?
 Which brave Spartan soul will stand up to express modern masculinity in a way palatable to examination and analysis in the way man used to? When will destiny manifest our Marquis de Sade - who understand fully the Ultimate Revolution deeper than most – our Hemmingway, or Hunter T. Thompson? Hard dicked and harder drinking, set soley on understanding power and lust and life and the conquest and joy of a drunken one-night-stand. Who writes to justify these Herculean hedonists, when the draw of an easy article for an audience of girls who's backward media allow them to have written anything other than “I am a feminist because... I am unattractive”? Where are the writers that talk to us about our thrill to primal attention from pretty female attention? The adrenaline kick of bursting into clubs - lickety-spit, nose caked in coke and head full of sexists jokes - to get some fucking pussy? 
We live in a time where feminist blogs affect to some sort of intellectual nourishment, where positivism and playfulness are fascistic and fearful. We live in a time where the pretender to the title of Man of Letters feels he has to debase his true masculine nature in a sordid attempt to find himself at a dinner table of enlightening thinkers, even though he knows, in his heart of hearts, everything that's being served is out of date. We need a grand deconstructor to take come out and say that he is a man and he is proud.
By God, by this stage we'll even take another American Psycho -  as long as faggy-brained critics don't turn it into a critical analysis on Yuppieism. We'll take another Byron. A flesh-lover, larger-than-life fucker. A true romantic. None of this inane Hollywood fuckwittery of flowers and last chance planes. A real romantic of instant attraction and animal passions. A violence filled, fist clenched attention seeker who'd drink a pint of piss for a laugh and bench-press you girlfriend. Who'd ride off to go and shoot at foreigners and die a heroes death. Who'd get big and strong, but not just for size and strength. Who'd shag and drink but not just to cum and get drunk. 

 But the raw experience of being mad and bad is dangerous to know in an antiseptic Britain full of follow the leader media and cookie cutter cuteisms, and isn't that a damn shame?
 
The problem isn't the great British douchebags. The problem is the best minds of a generation have been lost to a fearful madness; following and forking no new lightening. The problem is that lad culture hasn't found its true expression in art and society, beyond shitty bro-step and shittier reality TV.

The sum of it may best be expressed: the modern British douchebag might be an erection in a vest, but that sure beats being a flaccid cock in shit shoes.

Remove anyone but gravity, and atoms come apart at the seems, and matter starts existing only on a subatomic level. Without gravity, all stars would explode, there would be no planet with an atmosphere, and other nasty things which would make life impossible.

But let's say we remove something more innocuous, like neutrinos. Neutrinos are so tiny that trillions pass through you and only one will hit, causing a tiny shift in one of the atoms in you. But they are a fundamental subatomic particle, and removing anything like that would change how stars work, and again, result in the universe being uninhabitable.

So, let's take something far less necessary out of the equation, like silicon. Again, massive extinction, huge problems with chemical reactions, and worse, no computers and therefore no internet.

How about we remove the noble elements, who have basically no interaction with other chemicals except in extraordinary circumstances? Well... they would be created as a result of the sun burning, and then vanish into nothingness as they do not exist, causing a lowering of the gravitational pull of stars over time, and planets shifting out of their orbits over said period, and again, massive extinction.

The thing is, that once you remove something fundamental from the universe, it would still exist, but the chances of it being habitable to the lifeforms currently existing in it over a long enough period of time become zero. Other life forms might emerge, and all kinds of awesome exotic interactions would as well, but we would unfortunately not be there to see it.

Whilst clearly you possess an aptitude for writing,it smacks of someone writing about something which is alien to them. A social commentary from someone safely on the outside of things and as such destined to never really *get it*.

For every 'lad' there is also an intelligent, thoughtful person somewhere in society. Unfortunately this is masked by the fact that you can go into any bar on a Friday night and see the 'lad' in all his glory, peacocking away and generally making a tit of himself. In turn the media then project this negative image onto the rest of the nation in a way similar to that which was described by Stanley Cohen when he spoke of the [folk devils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_devil)and moral panics of the 60's.

Being a 'lad' strikes most people as a very un-British trait. Confidence, hyper-sexuality and a slightly less conservative moral compass seems alien to the older generations tutting away at their copy of the daily mail whilst harking back for the days 'when men were men' so to speak.

You can identify and vilify any number of social groups in modern day Britain who would meet stern disapproval from past generations but this is not indicative of a break down of established patterns of behaviour (i.e. classical notions of masculinity). From chavs through to ladettes and all the way to the current macho 'lad' culture, this is all representative of the changing times we live in.99 times out of 100 people mature and grow out of this phase before finally settling into their more natural, comfortable personality.

Some points you made which I very much like pertains to men instinctively trying to appeal to women and the supposed negative effect of single parents projecting negativity onto their offspring. I think these are both valid and intelligent points but some of the conclusions drawn aside from that seem to be lacking in logic.

 I would argue that these women raised by single mothers with an inherent distrust of men are actually more dependant on men than previous generations. In days gone by a women was taught to present theirselves in the 'correct' way in order to appeal to suitors and as such was reared to be a well adjusted member of society with clearly defined standards of behaviours whilst todays 'fatherless' generation seem to try and fill the void left by an absent father with the nearest male capable of outwardly projecting the girls ideals of masculinity.

I think its clear that the supposed breakdown of traditional British society is a lot less down to 'lads', hyper sexuality and mothers imparting resentment of men into their daughters than it is to the previous generations of men's ideals of 'sophisticated British masculinity' leading to the initial breakdown of many couples (poor emotional intelligence, adultery etc).

are you serious? BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

he may have made his complaint in good faith but that doesn't make it a cast iron fact. if you are stupid enough to look at a coincidence and jump to a conclusion as ""Good enough"" for a campaign or social agenda then you really do deserve a trial by media.


there is a wonderful irony here that a stupid young man put 2 and 2 together and made 5 and used this as a platform for promotion, and now has been caught out as the reality is that its 4 and always has been, and no doubt he will himself be complaining about people putting 2 and 2 together about the details of his case and reaching the wrong conclusions as he did.

Accuracy is important, people who don't burden themselves with objective requirements and critical reasoning to ensure accuracy deserve to be at the mercy of uniformed public opinion.

i have no sympathy for him, he tried to stir up the masses with inaccurate/incomplete information, he can suffer from people doing the same about him and his motivations etc.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;What do you think our current issues are?

It appears that there is some level of unhappiness in the dressing room. Comments like ""There are some I can trust and some I can't"" and ""Some will forget about this result by the time we get on the bus"" etc do not fill me with confidence. This is in a loop with underwhelming performances and it is unhealthy. Poor performances are impacting the dressing room and a poor dressing room is impacting performances.

One of these two things needs to be broken for spurs to get out of this negative spiral. Problem is it is tough to turn results around when you have a disgruntled side and tough to pick the side up in the face of poor results. I can certainly see how a managerial change (and slight clean up of personnel) in the summer may help, in the short term things don't look excessively bright.

Focusing on the positives. Eriksen most certainly looks to be a player we can trust and has proven himself to be of the required calibre. Since Modric/VDV left spurs haven't come close to recreating their creative abilities, Eriksen is more than a step in the right direction and I would go as far as saying one of those two pairs of shoes are filled. 

Walker looks to have shaken off some of his issues from last season and the RB position is quite well locked down. I think his runs down the right have been great all season and I expect Lamela to thrive within the space created by Walker when the opportunity arrives. This combination (and Eriksen in the middle) involves players that are 22, 23 and 23 years old.

Sandro is unmistakeably transitioning into a leader role at the club and this appears to be caused by a legitimate love for the club and the fans. Skill-wise he has been lacking slightly this season compared to last (I attribute this to injuries) but his passion is second to none. I would not be surprised to see the beast wearing the captains arm band next season and at only 24 years old he has a huge future at the club.

true,smokey815,num11,,"My thoughts are well documented on here.

I don't think Sherwood should be here come the summer.  At least, not in his current role.  I don't think he does a good job with team selection, or with implementing a tactic that actually caters to our strengths and masks our weaknesses.  His substitutions have been questionable as well lately.  I wrote up this comment yesterday specifically in regards to that match:

&gt;Today, he fielded a team with Eriksen on the left wing. Eriksen is by far more suited to the middle, and succeeds despite being pushed out there, not because of it. Even then, that idea can be effective. You lose width, but it's made up for by an overlapping fullback. Except we didn't have one of those. He chose to field the right footed Kyle Naughton instead of Zeki Fryers, an actual left back.

&gt;This resulting in the exact same problem we had against West Ham way back when AVB was in charge. We basically ignore the left hand third of the pitch and voluntarily compressed ourselves into the middle and right hand channels.
Then take a look at the center of the pitch. Early on, we showed an inability to control the ball in the center of the pitch. Benfica were pressing well and not letting us move. We didn't have an outlet. We were outnumbered and swarmed in the midfield. One fix for this would be to take off Harry Kane and add Chadli or Townsend. They operate in the wide position, and this does two things. First, it spreads the pitch. We have more room to work and move. It opens up passing lanes. It also rectifies the situation I described before, where we were outnumbered.

&gt;Instead of relying on a striker to drop deep at the right time, Eriksen is there. That changes the roles Paulinho and Sandro have to perform as well. They no longer have to get the ball from the centerbacks and move it all the way forward. They have our most effective playmaker just ahead of them, and because the field is now effectively wider and more open, they can pick out a pass easier.

&gt;Both of these things could be achieved at the start of the match by choosing a more balanced starting XI, or at half time by making just one change. Two, if you want to take off Naughton as well.

&gt;And when he did make a change, what really changed? Swap Rose for Walker and change Naughton over to right back. A good decision, but he left it to far too late to do. If you were that concerned about Rose's fitness, then play Zeki. He's shown he's got a decent enough head on his shoulders and can handle going forward well enough.
Kane for Soldado was basically a like for like. Take off one striker for another. Again, far too late. You don't give Soldado nearly enough time to get into it and make an impact. It also doesn't change anything. We don't play any differently. We just have a different player doing the same thing.

&gt;The last sub was Bentaleb on for Sandro. For me, he was handcuffed a bit by Sandro's yellow. But then again, he carried that yellow for 70 whole minutes. If he was concerned, he should have taken him off sooner. If not, then Sandro can last ten minutes. Bentaleb was the right man to come on, we needed his composure. But it was too late, and once again did not solve the fact that we were outnumbered in midfield.

I don't want to turn this into a Sherwodd bitch-fest, but I do think a lot of our problems will be solved by bringing in a new manager.  I think out under performing players, guys like Paulinho and Soldado, will be better served with a manager who puts them in the best position to succeed.  

A lot of our problems have been evident even before the managerial chance though, to be fair.  We lack direction and ambition in all aspects of our attack for large portions of matches.  Our wins, though they still count as wins, have been earned largely on the backs of shaky, yet effective, defending and one or two moments of attacking creativity.  We seem to have no idea what to do with the ball when we get it.

In terms of attempting to fix that, I think it's a matter of philosophy.  Early on, what I liked about Sherwood was the urgency he had us playing with.  When we got the ball, we looked up the pitch and tried *immediately* to do something with it.  We don't do that right now.  I think, for whatever, reason, Tim has fallen back onto some of the same tendencies we saw from AVB.  He seems to play players out of position when we don't really need to.  Eriksen is my main complaint, though I'm sure it's been argued to death.  Why play him on the left right now?  If Ade/Soldado are in form, I understand.  If our wingers are unfit, I understand.  But with two healthy left wingers, and playing a 20 year old second striker in the center instead, I don't.  Nacer Chadli has been more dangerous than any of our wide players in his last few appearances, and I still have confidence in Townsend to be a very good left winger.  That point is a bit repetitive considering my earlier point, but I think it's relevant all the time, not just in the context of yesterday's match.

Overall, my main complaint encompasses all of that.  We need someone managing this team who can look at our players, and put them on the pitch in some general formation, and give them roles that build on each others strengths.  We need someone who actively makes us better.  I don't even think we need to sell/buy many players.  I sincerely don't believe that they are the problem.  The one transfer I think we *need* to make is bringing in a starting quality left back and sell Rose.  I like him a lot, but he's not willing to be the backup.  And if unless he shows real signs of improvement these last couple months, I don't know that we can wait on him.  I think we can hold on to Vert/Hugo for one year with the right manager.  We may have to look toward replacing them in the future, but I don't think we will right now.

Those are my thoughts, feel free to debate.  You know I'm more than willing to.",0,1394814498,null,0,false,0,cg2j077,t3_20escm,t1_cg2j077,t3_20escm,null,1432799006,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Substituting on Soldado (a poacher by trade) when spurs weren't creating any chances in the match was always going to be lacklustre. 

I'm not convinced that any tactical switch last night would have improved Paulinho (short of pulling him off the field), I doubt that Sherwood told him to sit deeper than Sandro, or to not run at all. Plenty of complaints can be levelled at Sherwood but Paulinho was awful last night.

Looking forward I think spurs would be foolish to play 4-4-2 on the weekend.

My problem with Sherwood is that he seems to select a team without any anticipation of what the other team is going to do and how to counter their game plan.  In addition he seems to not view how each change in players modifies the overall shape.  I understand playing Eriksen on the left to avoid him getting man marked more easily in the center but Sherwood needs to see that this opens up space on the left wing and not add a second striker to further clog the center.

I actually thought Paulinho played well yesterday.  He was handcuffed with no space to make runs through a crowded center. Thought Sandro was especially limited in his passing range forcing Paulinho to act as our creativity from deep, a role which he is not especially suited for.  Also had to help out more defensively as Sandro was limited after the early yellow.

I wasn't impressed with Eriksen's first half as his set pieces were poor and seemed to give away the ball too easily.  Attribute this mostly to overcrowded center but would have liked to see him drop either deeper or wider to counteract that change.

We have no ideas going forward and look pretty toothless to be honest. I cannot wait to see a midfield with Sandro, Lamela, Townsend/Chadli and Eriksen all playing their preffered positions.

 Let's look at the last 5 years, as it is probably what is most relevant here. (Yes, I get it, in the 90s we were average. But you should expect any institution that wants to thrive to aim to improve.)

 We've proved that we are good enough to get into the CL, we have invested heavily in bringing new players in, we are considered a very good team and it is perhaps *because* of the past that people are so desperate to prove that Spurs can be up there amongst the best. (Well, that and a specific set of circumstances that gnaws at me like the infamous Lasagna Incident.) Most fan's mentality (in my opinion) is 'we've done it twice, been robbed of it once, so why the hell can't we do it again?' 

 Tottenham has obviously been improving over the past 5 years as both a football team and a business, going from a mid table side to one who has played in Europe regularly, albeit the lesser competition. We've had amazing players, Modric, VdV, Berba, Bale, King and yes, we have become expectant of success. 

 The thing is, if you compare us to the scum, to Man Utd, Chelski, Man City and even Liverpool to a large extent, they are the people we're trying to beat out and they have a hell of a lot more experience when it comes to developing a team and all of its related components that can consistently get into the CL and compete there. We've become the 'best of the rest' so to speak, but it's the place at the end of the season that matters and we, at the moment, don't measure up to the bigger teams. Liverpool's decline has helped, but City's bank roll has effectively bought that spot. Now Man Utd are slipping, Liverpool has taken advantage with their SAS partnership to claim the 'free' top 4 spot. 

 (We also seem to have a revolving door policy when it comes to managers, but that is a separate issue)

We'll get there, but it will take time.

As I say, he had about 3 good games and has been a pretty poor player for us overall this season- he is all technique and no brain as it stands, a hell of a lot of potential, but a good few years off playing at an international level.

I continue to talk about our over-reliance on Barkley, and explain why I feel he is some way off the level that he is being suggested as playing at.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; It appears that there is some level of unhappiness in the dressing room.

This is my concern because (and maybe its just me) it has seemed that under both AVB (with the exception of Ade and maybe Benny) and Sherwood the players have ""liked"" the manager but in the end don't seem to have a great deal of respect for his ideas.

Tim seems as if he is a likable guy, seems like the type of guy you would want around the club, but he is young and very inexperienced and i think some of the players are reacting badly to playing for a manager with so little experience. Add into the fact that Sherwood has never seemed like a full time replacement but more a caretaker (An 18 month contract isn't a vote of confidence its a hedge in case he does very well so you don't have to deal with a contract negotiation right away) and i think some of the players just don't fully respect him.

Its the type of attitude that can sap a squad because it feels like they are just drifting through the season. This is exacerbated by the fact that while Sandro seems to be stepping up as a leader, he thus far hasn't seemed to become the full fledged clubhouse leader.  I said it elsewhere on here in the past 2 seasons we lost Bale, Modders and VDV and the only question we seemed to care about was how do we replace Bale/Modders/VDV. Thing is....we also lost Gallas, Parker and Ledley and we never gave a thought how to replace that leadership in the squad.

Personally i would like to see us move for LvG if we legitimately have a shot at him, seems like he could come in and have the respect of the players as well as help develop a true philosophy at the club that spreads from the top down.  I know some people are concerned that we would probably only get 3-4 years tops out of him, but if he can set the club down a path where we have an actual philosophy for style of play (beyond ""attacking"") then finding a manager to replace him becomes easier (look at Swansea each manager follows the philosophy but puts their own spin on it but the philosophy from top down remains the same) and then identifying players becomes easier then if we are jumping from continental manager to old school english manager to continental manager every 3 years.

All that said we have some terrific young talent for any manager to build on in Eriksen, Lamela, Bentaleb and Townsend. We may need to clear out a couple players and we may lose 1 or 2 but i think we have some really talented youth that we can build on and Baldini and Broomfield seem to be constantly looking for more. I think we could really look at bringing in an squad leader to pair with Sandro and that would help any manager we have in place have more success.",0,1394818738,null,0,false,0,cg2kzem,t3_20escm,t1_cg2kzem,t1_cg2iwdz,null,1432799933,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

West Brom - Everton: Lukaku's passing accuracy is lowest at 46%(!), out of the other outfield players that also played 90 minutes, the second lowest is Jags at 79%. Lukaku had 2 shots, neither were on target. He gets an assist.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; I like him as a guy and his league record has been slightly better than avb's. He did well bringing ade back into the team but has been let down by the club and the fans. This whole season has been very unprofessional by the club and immature by the fans. I hope he stays at the club somehow and has a successful future. His simple football philosophy and honesty is very refreshing.

I feel the same way, Tim is a likeable guy...speaks honestly, seems to approach things with passion.  Good guy to have around a club.

Not sure i think he will ever be a ""great"" manager, but honestly few are, i think down the line he could end up in that Pardew/Harry/Big Sam/Steve Bruce line of managers that occasionally have a really great season and occasionally have a really poor season but most of the time they keep their squad competitive...an average manager. 

I do think he needs to learn before he can get there, i just don't think we are in a place where we can let him learn with us. I think if Levy and the fans really expect more (warranted or not) then we need someone a few steps above Tim to get us there.

Wouldn't mind if he wanted to stay on dealing with the youth squads, think he would be an asset to the club and any new manager. Think he is the type of guy who could help the club with a number of things, unfortunately i don't think the timing is right for him to be the manager and things seem to be spiralling on him at the moment so i don't think he will be the manager come summer.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"I think our players don't have enough creativity quite honestly.  Our current tactics can be partially blamed, but I think we just don't have players that are in similar mindsets on how we want to play.  Comparing ourselves to other squads, they look for passes behind the back lines, move off the ball to get into better positions, and generally are looking to create when passing.  I don't think our players do this, for a variety of reasons.  Adebayor looks to hold the ball, while no one moves forward for him to pass to.  Dembele runs dribbles around 3 players, then passes out to the wing.  Eriksen looks for a pass, but no one is trying to make a creative run towards the goal, they open themselves up for a pass, and hope someone else does something similar, so we slowly hop our way down the field.  

Dembele, Paulinho, Lennon, our left winger, and whoever our back line is minus Walker are under performing.  

I think we need to look to bring in players that fit a style we want, rather than get a good bargain for a player.  Seems like too often, if we can get a good deal on a player, we will pursue that player, even if we don't 'need' them, or if they don't fit our current style of play.  Find a manager who has an attractive, efficient style of play, and try to get players that fit that system, rather than a rag-tag group of bargains.

I am genuinely apathetic about Sherwood.  I think he never really stood a chance.  We've been set in this groove of poor tactics and lazy play for too long for a first-time manager to have much of a chance.  I don't mind him being our manager currently, because it makes no sense to replace him, but I think we need a new manager at the summer.

Most of the people who didn't spot the gag in Baron-Cohen's spoofs, whether Borat or Ali G, merely patronised the character, and agreed gently, or played along when Baron Cohen's characters said something antisemitic or misogynist or whatever. The lesson is that we let these people from alien (sub-)cultures get away with saying the sort of things we'd disown our friends for.

Braided lines are a metal braid (hence the name) usually wrapped in a PVC coating to protect them. These have two benefits over rubber lines. They do not absorb moisture as readily and they do not expand under stress like rubber lines do.

This gives you a better and more reliable feel under braking.

As for a brand new 125 over second hand, that is really for you to decide. It's your money.

I'd suggest that after a year or two you might find it lacking and be looking to upgrade. Usually a 125 holds its value very well over here because of our licence structure, but you may find those bikes do not because they are not common here. That means you may struggle to find parts, dealers to work on them or have higher insurance costs. Even if you don't have any of those problems, there may be a perception of them by potential buyers.

true,modernafrican,null,null,"&gt; What do you think our current issues are? 

I personally think it is a mixture of 3 things.

1. Lots of new players, they take time to integrate, get to know each other play together etc. The only time buying lots of new players works is when you have a strong almost overbearing manger a la Mourinho who can impose his style and way of thinking on the team. AVB wasn't that guy and in my view it will take a season for all the new guys to integrate.

1. Losing Bale, this was huge, I made a comment the other day where I said I had been watching Real Madrid, and realised what Bale gave us. It wasn't just the goals and individual attributes. He was a massive headache for defences forcing them to double up meaning you either loose a man in the middle or at the back which created space. Plus he has amazing vision, passing and crossing he was our penetrative attacking instrument. Dembele and Paulinho haven't stepped up to the plate, Lamela is new and injured, Lennon and Townsend are too one dimensional and Eriksen while showing clear ability is still young, learning his way around and somewhat inconsistent.

1.  No leaders, Sherwood is right, every time I watch spurs there seems to be no one on the pitch who wants to win the game badly enough, can take the game and the team by the scruff of the neck. There used to be a spirit about the way spurs played, we didn't just play well, we fought, we came back from behind, we actually tried to win 50-50 challenges, we did not capitulate (it was absolutely the right word). This season I have seen us give up against City (twice), West Ham, Chelsea and Liverpool, it is infuriating. 

&gt; What players are under performing, and what reasons do you think there are for that? 

Obviously a lot of the new players who have to adjust to a new team, system, country language etc. But most disappointing for me is Paulihno if you see him play for Brazil he is a great box to box midfielder for Spurs I don't even know what's going on. Lamela is very young in a new country, lots of pressure and dealing with injuries to be honest I wasn't expecting much this year (remember how long it took Bale to come good). Chadli hasn't done anything to distinguish himself from our other wingers, Soldado is struggling to score (much as I like him). Dembele is also very disappointing for me I feel he is capable of so much more but rarely ever reaches it. 

&gt; What can be done in your opinion to help them improve?

We need to give a manager more than a season to get results, we get a new manager once every other season (or that what it seems like to me). You cant build a philosophy or team like that. Our senior players need to step up Dawson, Vertonghen, Dembele, Lennon, Lloris this is on their shoulders. I honestly don't know enough about what is going on in the dressing room but something has been off all season.

&gt; How do you feel about Sherwood?

I feel AVB was the architect of his own destruction, falling out with the chairman, falling out with Baldini, falling out with players (i.e. Adebayor and Assou-Ekkottu), falling out with back room staff (Freund),  criticising the fans and then taking heavy defeats it was too much. 

I like Sherwood. I feel the tactical criticism of him is wrong he is actually being very imaginative trying to find a formation that works. He obviously has passion, sometimes I want to throw him on the pitch if only to give the team a kick up the ass. I want him to stay, and get time to implement his vision and playing style, he seems to have a good idea of how he wants spurs to play and it sounds like way we want spurs to play. I want to give him time to integrate youth team players (I really like Bentaleb and Fryers and have heard many good things about Kane and Velkjovic), we have by all accounts a very expensive, and expansive youth system lets put it to use with a manger that knows the system and the players.

&gt; how do you think that can be fixed?a

I think we need to knuckle down this season and finish 5th. During the summer we should take a hard look at ourselves and have a bit of a  clean out, have a good pre season moulding a team and playing style. And I know this may be a bit of an unpopular view, keep Sherwood. We need to do what Liverpool have done, set a goal with our manager and give him the time to implement it, don't fall prey to excessive expectations and spending insane amounts in the transfer market.

UJM is shit when it comes to job hunting. Use google and local newspapers. Or just search ""jobs in &lt;your county/city/etc.&gt;"" to find some online. Similarly, google ""Recruitment agencies in &lt;your county/city/etc.&gt;"" to find some who might be able to help. I mean you've got to be proactive. You can't just look on UJM. You have to seek out every single job that's being advertised in your area, that you can reasonably get to or work for.

They gave me a new one, then the gears stopped working and then the throttle cable snapped. Got it repaired and something with the rear sprocket broke. Then the engine went again. They refused to give me a refund seeming as though they are not technically the dealer, they just import and sell them. I told them this was baloney and threatened legal action and they gave me half price off any bike in their showroom(I picked a nice Suzuki GSF650S for when I passed my big boy test.)

Surely the argument in favour of private subcontractors is that they can compete with each other, streamline themselves, make more efficient ""business processes"" and cut out bureaucracy.

Those that do this best are the ones that win (win contracts and thrive), and the profit is an incentive for them to do it, one that traditional *jobs-for-life* civil servants lack (however well-meaning they are, they are invested in the status quo). 

I'm not say this works, or does so consistently, but I don't believe that economies of scale is the argument in favour of privatisation.

My understanding is that the economies of scale are gained on the first 10,000 and 100,000 and are not so pronounced between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000. 

Obviously, this depends on the product and its costs, but in general I'd expect little loss to ""economies of scale"" if we divide a nation of 60,000,000 people into 5 or 6 regions and allow each region to handle procurement and stuff separately. 

IMO the cost of privatisation is that fat cat companies make guaranteed profits from cushy government contracts, and they don't properly compete with each other, because we'll bail them out if they're making a loss.

At Porto it wasn't a Barca/Guardiola 4-3-3, it wasn't about controlling possession it was about battering the other team with constant surging attacks. The tempo was quick because the team was constantly racing forward.  The midfielder's job was to transition the ball from the defence to the surging wingers as quickly as possible not control time of possession. 

I think things changed when he got to Chelsea, i think he wanted to implement a similar system but didn't have the pieces to do so. After that i think he felt you couldn't really play the aggressive ""fast break"" 4-3-3 and he shifted to a 4-2-3-1 control possesion that was a sort of hybrid of Mou's defend and counter and Barca's controlled possession. Problem is, i don't know that he ever figured out how to make it work and given his tactical rigidness didn't give the players enough freedom to create.

LvG i think would be able to strike the balance with our squad, he is demanding and stresses the system but also allows for players to have creative freedom.

true,TJP343,null,null,"The team has no identity to how they play in possession and they don't have cohesiveness when defending. It is similar to when Harry was here, a squad is picked and put into a formation and they're told to get on with it and play with passion. And that works well enough most of the time against smaller, less skilled clubs, it's why Spurs cake walked through the group stage of the Europa two years running and are able to find a way to beat the smaller clubs.

Against Crystal Palace for example, Pulis set them up very well defensively and had a clearly visible plan to frustrate Spurs, same when they played Stoke but Spurs had enough quality to come out winners in both matches, but purely on quality, not from their style and system outclassing Stoke/Palace's style and system and that is because there is no system, or a very basic system is in place.

Now when Spurs go against a bigger opponent than themselves do they attempt to do what Pulis had Palace do, setup the team in a defensive block that would counter and frustrate the system and style of the team they are playing? No. They go out and play how they always try to play and they look clueless. And it's probably because they are, they are sent onto the field without having been given the blueprint to execute to try and win the match. 

I'm not advocating Spurs go out and hire a Pulis type coach, not at all, but they need to have a philosophy of how they want to play in place and start putting the players into a system that will allow them to do so. And they need a manager who will realize when he is facing a squad with more quality than Tottenham and make the adjustments needed in the buildup to the game so the team is ready and has a plan and knows why they are being asked to do what is being asked of them.

Look at Swansea, they have definitive way of play and have had it for years and have continued to bring in players that fit that specific system. Not the best players they can afford, the right players they can afford and their is a massive difference in that distinction. They have a squad that if a player wants to be a member of it they must be comfortable on the ball, capable of passing, unafraid to play in their own half, willing to press, willing to work as part of a collective and have creativity and a smart footballing brain. 

Spurs have plenty of quality but does their areas of high quality vary too much from player to player? Possibly. The other more apparent realization is that Spurs players are not being played where they are best, is Paulinho really the one you want dropping deep to collect possession from the centerbacks? Do you really want Dembele taking defenders on in the middle of the pitch or playing out wide and taking on opposition fullbacks? Eriksen is VDV, he will play centrally wherever he's fielded, as did VDV and Harry routinely played him wide on the right and left Walker with too much to do and now we're really going to watch Eriksen drift from the left and leave Rose with way too much to do as well?

Spurs have the ability to buy quality players but it has to be more than that, it has to be the right players and they have to have the right manager to put them into a system that they will succeed in. That was supposed to be AVB. It was not. 

Look at Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers has brought them back to the level of play where they belong, where they last were under Rafa Benitez because he has a system and style of play that he believes in and has gotten management to back his beliefs and brought in players that will play in the way they are needed to. And Roberto Martinez hasn't had more success than David Moyes yet, but in less than one season he's turned Everton into a team you don't actually mind watching instead of a boring, conservative, cross happy team that protected every one goal lead like the Alamo. He has a vision as well as to how the game should be played and he doesn't compromise from it because if he is given time, it will come through for him.

They lack identity and it's going to take someone to come into this club with a big enough reputation and big enough ego to change that, the reputation is needed so that Levy has to back off and give him time and the ego and belief in a certain style is needed to win over the players, bring in ones that fit, get rid of ones that don't and change the culture. Levy is smart enough to know that if he keeps firing managers, eventually the blame is going to start to go higher up the food chain and he's next.",0,1394824630,null,0,false,0,cg2nsd4,t3_20escm,t1_cg2nsd4,t3_20escm,null,1432801253,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The in famous 4-4-2 was more a shifting 4-3-3 - to 4-4-2 with Eriksen drifting off the left in attack and back in to defend. Bentaleb plays because Sherwood wants to keep the ball and Dembele, Paulinho, Lennon, and Sandro aren't the best at that and neither do they have Bentaleb's passing range. Or style of play has changed, we are more direct, quicker, Eriksen when he plays gets more freedom to create than he did under AVB, our wing backs are more effective and we are trying to move the ball better. It has worked well sometimes i.e. Newcastle but others like last night we are sloppy, our box to box midfielder (on this occasion Paulinho) checks out, we give the ball away and we don't seem committed on the pitch. I blame the players because this was a problem before Sherwood, we didn't seem to want to win games and had no drive or confidence. I see what Sherwood is trying to do, play spurs football, but the players look to be stuck in 2nd gear, i think he needs to be given more time to actually build a team. On top of that he knows the club, he has good relationship with Levy, he knows the players, he knows what the fans want.

We already have 49MEPs in the European Parliament so won't be working in isolation.

We have 4 principles:

1. Social Justice - We want to tackle the high levels of deprivation and poverty through commitments such as the living wage. We are fighting against the running down of our health service. We believe that the excessive wealth inequality where 85 people hold the equivalent wealth of half the worlds population is wrong and we will campaign against this. 

2. Sustainability. For every 1 barrel of oil we discover today we're consuming 4. We need a resilient economy that can withstand shocks and doesnt generate enormous levels of waste - and ultimately waste money. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ-J91SwP8w 

3. Grassroots democracy. We want to see decision making by communities and decisions to be in their interest. The Green Party is the ONLY party in the NI Assembly which doesn't accept corporate donations and the ONLY party in the Assembly which publishes all donations we do receive over £500. Democracy is a sham when you can't find out who is funding our political parties and who is pulling the strings.

4. Peace. Greens believe in promoting peace through measures such as respecting cultures, promoting freedom, eradicating poverty and understanding the context of conflict. We need this in NI.

He is also a bit inconsistent he can completely disappear in a game (i.e. Man city). I don't really think its his fault though, the centre of our midfield has been pretty poor. I still think we look better going forward than we did under AVB whose system was too rigid and relied to heavily on the two in the middle. If you look at Sherwood's teams he has been busy plugging holes, in the Christmas new years period we played the same team because everyone else was injured. And is battling a team that seems intent on shooting themselves in foot. Against Chelsea we had a very good game plan (walker playing in the midfield was bullying players off the ball, providing natural width and pace) then we self destructed.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"Ticket prices are extremely high. Essentially, the fans are being asked to bear (a large part of) the burden for the club's ambition. The reason those ticket prices are so high is because Tottenham are making an effort to compete with clubs that have more resources. We have the [10th largest stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013-14_Premier_League#Stadia_and_locations) in the Premier League, behind teams like Aston Villa, Newscastle, Everton, and Sunderland. Despite that, over most of the last decade we've managed to outperform all of those teams.

In the past few years, the board has been putting a lot of effort into making the club a bigger global name, with such moves as pre-season tours in Asia and the US (which have arguably hurt the performance of the team in the early season), buying Khumalo, Dempsey, and Friedel, as well as deals with [Supersport United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersport_United#History), [South China AA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_AA#Partnerships), and the [San Jose Earthquakes](http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/tottenham). The success of this global push is one reason so many Americans have become supporters in the last few years.

There's no question whatsoever that the local fans have repeatedly been treated poorly by the club, and I in no way condone that. I can only hope (and this may be a pipe dream unless there is massive protest) that if/when the long term plans to build a bigger stadium happen, there will be cheaper tickets available for fans.",0,1394831599,null,0,false,0,cg2r37e,t3_20eld9,t1_cg2r37e,t1_cg2j3ob,null,1432802876,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,schubart,null,null,"Thanks for your reply. You're right, it's all about the tires. Mudgards, rack, baby seat, etc. are secondary.

The bike originally came with 650x25c tires. Sounds harmless, but apparently that's an exotic and confusing size: Cycle Surgery sold me a completely wrong tire, even though I brought my bike to the shop and asked them to decode all the sizing info printed on the old tire. They gave me a refund but they had to send me on my way without a new tire. Likewise, when I tried to buy inner tubes at Evans, they said they'd have to order them.

The only place that had tires and tubes that fit the bike was tokyobike near Old Street. They recommended the Gatorskins, but they only have them in 650x23c. So in the hope of upgrading to more robust tires, I also moved to skinnier ones. Probably not a smart move...

OK, after browsing Sheldon Brown, Wikipedia, Wiggle and Amazon for an hour or so, I came to the conclusion that 650c tires are mostly used for tri bikes and smaller road bikes. There's not a lot of choice for tires in this size, especially not the kind of robust commuter tires we're talking about there. I don't think Schwalbe Marathon Plus or Michelin City come in this size (I'd be happy to hear that I'm wrong, though).

Which makes me think I should really get a different bike. It seems that that 700c wheels would give me lots of options for sturdy, wide tires like the ones you mentioned.",0,1394832421,null,0,false,0,cg2rgnh,t3_20cjk5,t1_cg2rgnh,t1_cg22v1h,null,1432803056,1,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"I can't be definitive, but teams like Fulham and Palace are aware that there are a lot of Liverpool fans considering buying tickets in the home end so they often will only sell to people who've been to previous matches. 

Hopefully you'll make some friends who support London clubs and they'll take you along. 

Fulham are actually a bit of a peculiarity, in that they have a neutral end. Tickets go on sale to FFC season tickets first, who snap them up and sell them on Viagogo. It's still as expensive as going through a tout, but because it's the official Fulham ticket reseller, you at least have peace of mind.

If I lived in London and I was desperate to go to an away at a reasonable price, this is what I'd do: keep checking RAWK for the ticket thread to go up and get a request in early. You'll probably be ignored, but being on the first page will help for step two. On the day of the match, edit your post to say you still want tickets and you'll be at the ground. Lots of people drop out on the day and their mates just want to get rid of their spare and get on with enjoying the build-up, so ""less hassle"" trumps 10k+ posts on RAWK. Also, if you're in a pub where loads of Liverpool fans are, just ask around. Some people might try it to fleece you but  a lot of fans are vehemently opposed to selling tickets above face value.

I'm not condoning what he did, but five and a half years seems ridiculously long for three Youtube videos. They might have been tasteless, and they were inciting violence, but there are plenty of other people on the internet who do the exact same thing and don't get arrested. Christ, I could probably trawl around news sites reporting this story and find people advocating violence against him. This reaction seems completely over the top.

&gt; He [Naeem Mian, who was mitigating for Barnes] said his client was vulnerable to coming under bad influences, having been taken into care at the age of eight and prevented from attending his mother's funeral after she died in custody.

It seems like there are also some mental health issues involved. Surely some sort of counselling would have been better, or sectioning if he was dangerous, instead of just shoving him in a normal prison. 

EDIT: I decided to trawl the Daily Mail for some comments to back up my point:

&gt; She should have been sentenced to the same as her partner....will she be forced to remove the veil in prison....she probably will in any case otherwise she may be picked on by inmates...but really hope that she is tormented by them...........hope she gets what she justly deserves....

&gt; Why was she allowed to keep her veil on in court. Rip the bloody thing off her head and let everyone see what this scum looks like. (+747, -20)

&gt; Stupid or what? Misguided, ignorant and naive, what idiotic, uneducated things they are. I would like to have a two minute 'chat' with both of these freaks. (+45, -0)

Wonder when the police will be knocking on their door, arresting them for inciting violence?
