I actually wrote a dissertation on this issue of the Quebec independence movement, comparing it to its Scottish counterpart. The 1995 referendum was a little bit out of the blue as it largely resulted from a failing Liberal government in Quebec and the collapse of the Lake Meech and Charlottestown Accords (which aimed to bring Quebec closer to Canada and return certain provincial powers won in the 70s to Ottawa, but were vetoed by Alberta and New Brunswick). 

Post-1995, the separatists (the Bloc Quebecois wing of the Parti Quebecois) controlled the province for a while and it ticked along, but as Montreal got more and more important and the province generally prospered, the pro-sovereignty movement kind of faded away. The financial crisis and Jean Charest's disasterous Premiership (if you remember the year-long student strikes, yeah, that was him) led to an upsurge in nationalist support, and PQ Leader Pauline Marois was elected in 2012.

Net change of ~£123k per week, or ~£6.3M per anum.

Added to which talks of new contracts for the likes of Sterling and Flanagan will drive it up a bit more.  

Done from the top of my head so may well have missed someone and obviously the pay amounts are complete fiction since they're not exactly released.

1. He'd never seen a full episode of Doctor Who before landing the role of the Doctor
What a confession! The crowd more or less gasped when Smith admitted, somewhat sheepishly, that he only started watching the show after being cast in the titular role. ""It's true, I'm afraid it's really true,"" he said, before adding that he subsequently watched the whole series and fell in love with it.

I don't believe he watched the whole series. I read somewhere he wanted to play the Doctor closer to the second Doctor and I thought he managed to pull it off for the first few episodes of his first season. The he just started playing it as Matt Smith as the Doctor. If you liked that, that's fine. You had a good , long (some would say too long) run with Smith as the Doctor. To each their own. Those of us who don't like all to convenient endings may be a little happier now.

I've yet to see anyone claim that the apparent problems in British Pakistani Muslim culture is due to their racial characteristics.  No-one has said ""It's time to face up to the problem of sexual abuse in the brown-skinned community"".  I haven't even seen anyone claim that these are problems with Asian people or brown-skinned people in general, despite the Guardian's insistence on using the 'Asian' euphemism to refer to these rape gangs.

Yes, some of the response to Rotherham really is motivated by racism.  But that doesn't mean that all of it is.  

But I understand.  The Guardian treats its readership with contempt.  It will keep on deflecting any reasonable criticism, much of it from its *own readers*, by attacking anyone who disagrees as racist.  

Edit:  Wouldn't the appropriate satirical switch be to write an article about *Christian* abuse?  Isn't it most instructive to compare the outcry over problems like the Catholic child abuse scandals?  

Edit II:  As some of the commenters point out there appears to have been a racial motivation to these crimes alright, but it was racism against *white* girls.  Are we allowed to discuss that?

So, perhaps a good analogy would be if white Christian gangs in multiple towns were raping thousands of Muslims.  If that were the case, then I think I'd be the first to ask if there was a problem with British-Christian culture and I suspect the Guardian would be running article after article about how British Christians are promoting a rape-culture.

The old cliche about if you don't move forward, you essentially go backwards is true.  We were never going to sign a really big name, but we did need to sign a wide forward/winger, and a backup for Eriksen/Lamela.  It feels like we were maybe pinning hopes on landing Welbeck, without realising he's easily choose a Champions League club over us.

I don't have a huge problem in letting Holtby go if we were going to replace him.  Not doing so seems damn shortsighted at this point in time... on par with lending Benny to QPR when we had only Rose at LB, selling Caulker and leaving us short at CB in an injury crisis, and letting Defoe go when Soldado was misfiring and Ade was the only other senior striker at the club.

Let's face it - we've had terrible judgement in the last couple of seasons in terms of squad depth, and so for once I was looking forward to having MORE players than we actually needed.  Now it feels like between Europa and the league, Eriksen and Lamela are going to have to shoulder a lot of the burden to create.  I was never Holtby's biggest fan, but considering we got him for cheaps and probably weren't paying him mammoth wages, I really don't see the harm in keeping him around.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"Actually the Doctor has both changed so much and so little over the years, that is the beauty of it. Here is a run down of my experience of the show quality in production and writing.

**First and Second Doctors** 

Production quality: On the whole not terrible but this is the sixties so any future stories will have a somewhat dated feel. The black and white standard however allows them to get a way with a lot more and they would have in color since they get to play with shadows more. Generally the focus is on the people rather than the sets. The production quality takes a bit of a step up in the Second Doctor's tenure and things look a bit more clear cut.

Show Theme and Writing: Generally meant to be an educational adventure show at first which is why there are quite a few historical based episodes like the Aztecs and Marco Polo. A lot of the plot focuses on the main TARDIS crew being thrust into random situation after random situation. There is a relatively large turn over rate for the First Doctor so expect lots of different people coming through changing the crew dynamic. The Second Doctor has one companion that sees him through his entire tenure so the crew dynamic only slightly changes with the female lead.

**Third, Fourth, and Fifth Doctors**

Production Quality: Varies depending on how high they aim. Some episodes will actually amaze you with what they were capable of while others might make you turn away and laugh. The early color can look a little weird but it does get better. If there are difficult episodes try just focusing on the events and not the sets/effects because some of the episodes are really worth it to stick around.

Show Theme and Writing: The show starts to become a lot more of an action adventure dropping many sci-fi elements for the Third but quickly bringing them back for the Fourth and Fifth. The Third introduces the Master who also features quite a bit for the Fifth Doctor as well. The Fourth Doctor sees the first season long arc with the Key to Time series and after Sarah Jane most of his companions are now aliens (even if they appear human).

**Sixth and Seventh Doctors**

Production Quality: This is actually where you might have the most difficulty. This was the mid eighties and computer effects were becoming all the rage. But computer effects were not always the best back them so some effects will appear pretty wonky. The budget was also pretty abysmal for some of the things that they wanted to do.

Show Theme and Writing: Some wanted to tone down the violence and make it more silly while others wanted a darker more mysterious Doctor again so this time period can be pretty tonally inconsistent. The second major season long arc is introduced: The Trial of a Time Lord. If you really cannot make it through this period please give the Big Finish Audios a chance. They really do these Doctors more justice and you will see that the two actors were really given the short end of the stick.

**Eighth Doctor**

So for this one the movie is not as terrible as people say but it didn't really bring in anything interesting or new (and it added some things that it shouldn't have). So definitely dive into the Big Finish Audios, the really good ones feel like they could be New Who quality in both content and quality.

**The Doctor's Character**

As for the characterization you really don't have to worry about him being too different without the Time War. For his first Two incarnations he is essentially a fugitive from his own people and in some ways fears them. He hopes that one day he can go back but for now that is not an option. He is pretty angry at the Time Lords in his Third and Fourth Incarnations after his Trial and their manipulations of him and although he softens a bit in his Fifth incarnation he essentially becomes a fugitive again. The Sixth Doctor is put on trial by his own people for discovering some of their evil deeds. It turns out in the Seventh Doctors tenure that leaving Gallifrey in the first place might not have really have been just out of curiosity or even his choice as he stole an ancient weapon for some reason. It is also hinted that he might be one of the Time Lords' oldest and most revered progenitors.

And if you think he loses his dark characterizations, think again. The First Doctor nearly brained a wounded cave man because he was slowing him and his companions down. The Second Doctor manipulates his best friend to save another companion (he makes said friend believe he is working with the Daleks). The Third Doctor is challenged (physically and morally) by the Master at nearly every turn in the eighth season. The Fourth Doctor doesn't always treat people well, even his companions. He made his own people believe he betrayed them to the Vardans. The Fifth Doctor experiences so much pain and loss, he will probably remind you a bit of Ten and he rarely gets to leave a companion on good terms. The Sixth Doctor chokes his companion in a fit of post-regeneration madness and meets an inner evil worse than the Dream Lord. If you think the Eleventh Doctor breaking Amy's faith in him is heart breaking wait until you see the Seventh Doctor break down his companion Ace (and when he reveals why he took her on in the first place). He also commits genocide although indirectly.

The essence of the actor is filled in with the Doctor. And it's this change in personality and acting style from person to person that drives the very core of the story of the character himself: He regenerates over time.

Because of the 'regeneration' storyline, which is directly written to allow for a change in actors, I feel like ""So-so As the Doctor"" is perfectly in line with the very role itself.

Personally, I like the difference in dynamics. I didn't think I'd like the Capaldi switch but so far I'm liking the writing a bit better and what Capaldi brings to the screen.

Their viewer numbers are very likely to go down over time without a Doctor/Companion romance. It's very possible they may not see it immediately as people may think Capaldi is just an ""intermission"" between Doctors they are attracted to; but the writers aren't idiots.

true,a-ko,smith,Smith,"Honestly, there are things about Davies and Moffat I don't like, but overall I have to say I rate Moffat's writing a bit higher.

I never really liked the weird, kooky episodes Davies wrote (the old man helping the Doctor out? really?); or the weird, kooky monsters and style he put into the show.

I feel like Moffat has slowed down the character a lot more for us to get a better sense of the Doctor. Perhaps over time I'll grow to hate it, but I re-watched Eccleston with a friend this weekend and I realized that there was a lot more I hated to Eccleston's Doctor than just him, and that was the fact that they moved so quickly. Episodes were fast, very few moments where you could get a true sense of the Doctor. And the moments they did have that, I feel like Eccleston just fell flat in demonstrating that emotion.

Tennant had a significantly better display of emotions than Eccleston did, a significantly better actor. If I were to range Tennant's ability to be cooky fun Doctor and serious sad Doctor, it's somewhere that ranged from 11 to 12. Smith never truly was able to go ""mad"" or display true anguish in the character. The best he got was his speech in the Rings of Akhaten, which he did a tremendous job; but still nowhere near as low and capable as Tennant's ability to show just how deep the Doctor's sadness can go.

So Capaldi is a fantastic dynamic to that. Though it remains to be seen if Capaldi can go in the opposite direction. But he's a good actor nonetheless, and I'm actually enjoying him so far.

Overall, Moffat has done more interesting things to the overall Doctor Universe. The Weeping Angels are a fantastic addition to the repertoire of Doctor villains.",0,1409624383,null,0,1409624876,0,ck6qxrs,t3_2f6avh,t1_ck6qxrs,t1_ck6n1cq,null,1427247473,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt;We are a good team, but I just can't see this roster competing with teams like Chelsea and City. I hope I'm wrong. 

No, you're not wrong and you won't be proven wrong during the season. If you want to compete with  City and Chelsea you need to spend an equivalent amount. Which means shelling out 50 M for players and offering them 100+ per week. Which we just simply can't do.

&gt; I also think not signing a striker will come back to haunt Spurs. Would've loved to see the club splurge on a forward like Welbeck or Bony. 

After thinking more about it it didn't seem like Welbeck was ever a serious option. He wanted to play CF and only CF, apparently, which he wouldn't do ahead of Ade or Soldado. Say what you want about Soldado but he was third top scored in La Liga behind Messi and Ronaldo for, what, three seasons? The guy has got a lot of goals in him and this will show as the season progresses and everyone becomes comfortable with the system.

Bony would have been a disaster, IMO. We'd have to sell Soldado, most likely (who is realistically going to buy Adebayor and will he leave to a place like Turkey?), and that would leave us with Kane, Ade, and Bony. Meaning we'd have two of our strikers out for AT LEAST one month in the hardest stretch of the season. We'd have to rely on Kane for all of our goals for January and hope that Togo and Ivory Coast get eliminated early, which will quite possibly not be the case. If either makes the final we could be two months with Harry Kane as our only striker...

I think this is the case too. Once everyone is working together we'll be doing much, much better. We definitely have the squad to play Pochettino's preferred pressing style and all that is left is for them to learn some real communication and teamwork. And belief. We saw in the first half of the Liverpool match that we can compete with the best, even if we weren't performing well. Once that penalty went in, though, it was like everyone folded. That will get better with time. I'm sure we'll see some depressing results vs Liverpool, Chelsea, and City away but let's be realistic here - we don't have the financial muscle to keep up with them at the moment. We also don't have the money needed to buy the players they do and we definitely can't pay competing wages. We're left with finding players like Stambouli that are very good at what they do even if they're not a household name. Which, in my opinion, is how to run a club.

I wanted to get caught up, so I ignored the RTD stuff and started with 11's first series. I had tried very hard to get into the show a few different times with Eccleston, but.. I didn't. I couldn't. I gave it several episodes and was just bored.

So I jumped ahead to Matt. And I fucking loved it. I get the points about having a lot of ideas and cramming too many of them in - I see that and only after watching the Tenant series, did I have an appreciation for what I couldn't put into words, which is self-control. I enjoyed quite a bit of 10's run - not all of it. Some of it was bad.

And frankly, some of it was completely batshit stupid. Sorry. I hated the ending of *Last of the Time Lords*. It was goddamned horrible. I have re-watched it probably 4-5 more times, and it's not the performances being given (which are good, though I never enjoyed Martha), it's the complete and utter *magic.* And that happens repeatedly in RTD episodes.

He's saved from laser blasts by *fucking hope.* He has been aged as if he could not regenerate, to the age of 900+ and it's solved *with a lot of faith?* I'm sorry, we're done now. You want to decry an episode as ""fan fiction"" and then call Moffat a shit writer? That end of an episode just lost the game - to say nothing of the fact that it was a **finale.** *End of Time* was very decent, but that's as far as I'll go.

I can at least give credit for the setup of *Last of the Time Lords*, which I thought was very nicely done. It was a good, multi-episode/foundation-creating tactic and deserves a great deal of praise, because unlike some of Moffat's work, once you saw it all, it made complete sense and it didn't seem like things got lopped off because they ran out of time.

I guess what all of this is to say is this - I liked the energy of RTD's handling. It was pretty fucking upbeat, even when it got down. The ending of *Waters of Mars* was outstanding and crushing. There could be soul searching and I didn't want to tear my own heart out. But the concepts were slapdash sometimes. Too often. And I think that a lot of people who saw RTD's series and then Moffat's overlook the serious inconsistencies, poor ideas and really awful writing that sometimes gripped that time.

I'll take the worst Moffat'll put out a hundred times before I'd want RTD to take another swing at it, because I'm afraid I'd hate it. I loved most of Moffat's stuff--and I come with no axe to grind, I'm a pretty new fan. I *got through* RTD's stuff. Some I loved. Some I hated.

&gt; We have a net spend of -10 M or somewhere thereabouts WITHOUT selling any of our important players

What do you care about net spend? Where is the extra money going? It sure as hell isn't going into wages or transfers so does this do the team any good? With as much as Tottenham isn't spending on transfer, they should have a metric fuck ton for a stadium... but I highly doubt that's where the saved money is going.  

&gt; We plugged our defensive holes and ensured our players can all play in their best position

Way too early to tell if any holes have been plugged. If anything, last weekend should tell us that there is still long way to go. Unless Fazio is far better than advertised, we may be spinning our wheels here. 

&gt; We bought very young, with our oldest purchases being 30 (GK) and 27 (CB) replacing a 43 year old GK and an almost 31-year old CB

I'd agree.. though still feel extremely underwhelmed with Fazio. Really hope he proves me wrong. 

&gt; We kept our most important players

Honestly think this is debateable. On the pitch, absolutely. However, Sandro and Holtby were two of the best morale guys on the team. I don't know the inner team dynamics, but as a leader I know that those guys are what keeps the wheel turning during the bad times. We lost two of the highest work rate guys on the team and I don't think that is debatable. 

&gt; We picked up some great players for amazing deals - Marseille, Sporting, Sevilla, and Swansea fans weren't the happiest after we took their players for amazing deals (though I suspect Swansea fans don't mind one bit at the moment)

Great? Um... Outside of Dyer, I'm not holding my breathe for anyone else. Fazio could be a starter but all the moves are for squad players. I'd be highly surprised if more than two actually start consistently from this batch. Way too premature to even know if everyone was a decent buy, much less a great player. 

&gt; We're going to be treated to players we would have never other wise have heard of before (hint hint: not all the top players come from Champion's League clubs)

This is because Tottenham is a mid table team right now. Like it or not, Tottenham has been punching above their weight. Mid table teams HAVE to spend top dollar for top talent, which Tottenham has been reluctant to do. In the meantime, we are forced to find the best of what's available and pray that someone steps up like Dier... which means we will be gambling every year. 

&gt; All the while we:
&gt; Sold an injured DM who hasn't shown half the quality he had before his injury, even though he had plenty of time to recover - FOR 10 M
&gt; Got rid of a couple players who would never make it to our first team (Obika and Falque, the latter which basically covered the Dier transfer)
&gt; We sold Dawson, who despite being a great figure and a role model at the club wasn't much on the pitch against top-half opposition
&gt; Loaned out Holtby ensuring he'll get consistent first team playing time for the time being when he'd only ever feature in rare opportunities in cups for us

I'm OK with what we sold, and knew it had to be done. Just really wish we could have sold Lennon instead of Holtby, and Dembele/Paulinho instead of Sandro. It takes about 2 years to recover from a broken leg so no wonder why Sandro didn't look as good last year. 

&gt; The only negatives for me are the fact that we are counting on Lennon and Townsend as our attacking back up. But seeing as that's the only complaint I can come up with for this window I'd say it was quite the success.

Only complaint? We offered 24 million AND Andros for JRod! It's my opinion but JRod is overrated and for that type of offer, we could have easily snagged Griezman who was one of the best LW available. We waited until the ass end of Southampton's buyout before even making our moves, so of course SH wasn't going to sell. We wait till the end of the window before selling players which means we have now limited the amount of time to even do business because we all know that there is no way Levy is going to spend any money that does not come directly from the sales of current players. Lots more to be unhappy about. 


&gt; It seems like there's a few people in here (I won't call out any names but everyone knows who they are by this point) are trying to stir up some shit because we didn't bring in Alexis Sanchez as wing cover for Ronaldo or Falcao to lead the line. Some people just can't be pleased with some great business and will always look for more and more and more. Perhaps it's the Holtby love brigade downvoting half the posts in here, or maybe it's the Beast circlejerk. I don't know. I do know I've had a downvote bot hitting almost all of my posts the last couple days. It's getting ridiculous and this negativity just for the sake of negativity is really childish.
&gt; We've done great &amp; shrewd business and should be excited for the season ahead of us. It's going to be a hell of a ride, and we're going to see some exciting football. Let's use the international break to get ourselves and our expectations grounded again and enjoy the spectacle we're bound to see! COYS!

It is actually possible to think that this window wasn't a very good one and not be trying to stir the pot and childish. This sub is plagued by fans on both ends of the spectrum and it's posts like these that work to only divide the community instead of bringing it together. 

Depending on the plan, I would give this window either a D or a C (Not including getting Poch). It was very far from great but some dead weight and quality players were sold. We didn't make any waves when every single one of our leading competitors did. We all knew that this year was going to be a rebuilding year but the problem is we are going to start losing our quality players unless we make the CL. Vertongen isn't going to give us another year and why would he? Why should Lloris stay on a mid table team? If the rumors were at all true that some of our better players have a foot out the door but are giving it another year, then we as fans need to realize that it's going to take much longer before our ""ambitions"" are realized. 

I will say, the one thing that the one reason this offseason is overall a success is because we brought in Poch. He is going to be the X-Factor in deciding if we can buy another year for out top players. I have full faith in him and his abilities, but not our current squad. If Poch can keep the guys, then I would happily say this offseason is an A.

true,kde01,king,,"I think you're approaching this with far too much cynicism and not enough realism. I'm going to break your comment down into pieces to address certain areas.

&gt; We lack quality.

In a couple areas like the left and center of our AM, yes. But our defense is looking the best it has in recent memory and our midfield looks quite solid. We got rid of Sandro who wasn't able to hang around after his injury and replaced him with Stambouli, one of the best CDMs in Ligue 1. We picked up three very young and talented defenders - two of which have already proven they've got the talent, the third of which has just proven he has potential (Yedlin). We let Dawson go somewhere he could play week-in, week-out and brought in Fazio - a CB with experience defending (and succeeding) against some of the best attacking players in the world.

&gt; So far it seems that Pochettino is have a bit of trouble implementing his system, QPR game was encouraging, but we looked pretty flat against Liverpool and very vulnerable on the counter. 

I think this is incredibly unfair. In preseason we were looking better every match we played, and that continued in to the league. We showed we could do what we couldn't last year - grind out a match against a very defensive opponent and put what should be an easy match to bed handily. Yes, we lost to Liverpool 0-3. But we're talking about a team that has a set style the players are all very familiar with and a system they all know. They're communication is down pat. Their positioning is perfect. And yet we did quite well against them in the first half. What was missing was the belief - when the second goal went in we just gave up, it seemed. We need to get to that point where even 5 goals down we're still attacking trying to bring one back. 

&gt; Bentaleb has enormous potential but there is no way in the world he is good enough to be starting for a Top 4 team.

I'm two ways on this. He's currently not good enough to start for a top 4 team, yes, but that's because he's never started for a top 4 team. We're not top 4 though, and we can do with playing him in matches against bottom half teams. I think he'll be fantastic sooner rather than later, he just needs experience. Which he's getting now. With experience he'll get better. I wouldn't throw him on against City or Chelsea to get experience but against clubs on the bottom half and in cups he should be the main pick in that role.

&gt;Schneiderlin would have been a big upgrade, but once again, we failed to support a new manager with their key target. 

Where is the evidence that we failed to support the manager with his key target? All evidence has pointed to us trying hard to get him and Southampton shutting up shop and refusing to deal. This wasn't Levy's or the Club's fault. This was Southampton refusing to do business. Which is fine, that's their right. But don't put the fault on anyone except Southampton. 

&gt; We are lacking a clinical striker at the moment. Adebayor can be quite sloppy, doesn't get a shot away quick enough and just doesn't do enough work off the ball. He has already missed a couple of really good chances this season and it seems we're not too keen to give Soldado a chance which is disappointing.
 
Soldado managed to go an injure himself, which is why he hasn't been playing. Adebayor has his days, definitely, but I'm confident that Soldado will be able to bring it together and get to scoring. He may not be a league leader but I can see him burying 10 from open play in the league this year. 
 
 
&gt; Overall, a very average transfer window. Added some quality depth signing where required, but our first team which wasn't good enough last season (albeit under various managerial issues) hasn't been improved as much as it could've been and we're now relying on improvement of existing players, which at this stage will be a big ask.

An average window is exactly what we needed, I think. Pochettino knew we needed to strengthen in defense and Baldini and Levy made that happen. Now it's time to buckle down and get the team working well together before addressing additional issues. You can't buy a whole squad in a summer, you need to do it slowly. I think we learned that lesson last summer. We'll fine tune spot by spot. In January maybe we'll make a swoop for Jay Rodriguez and another AM if Paulinho isn't doing as well as we'd hoped, and then we can pick up Schneiderlin and another CF in the summer. We don't know how things are going to pan out, but we do now we addressed last year's woeful defense, which is a big step forward.",0,1409627948,null,0,false,0,ck6sjt3,t3_2f7n8w,t1_ck6sjt3,t1_ck6s3q8,null,1427246721,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,ollieseven,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; I get that Rose could be annoying, but you're actually going to suggest that she is somehow more dependent on the Doctor than Amy ""The Girl Who Waited"" Pond?

Yes. I'm looking at where they were by the time they left the Doctor. 

When Rose and Ten got cut off in Doomsday, I couldn't see her living a normal (after the Doctor, anyway) life after being cutoff from him, and she didn't. She spent her time after that trying to get back to him. **The point of her life from then on was getting back to the Doctor.** She gets saddled with fake-Ten, and lives the rest of her life with someone who's as close as she can get to the Doctor. 

&gt; Amy spent her formative years waiting for the dude to come back. She was a total Raggedy Man fangirl her whole life. She abandoned her fiancee for the guy in a heartbeat and only picked him back up because the Doctor insisted. Her wedding was used as a resurrection machine for the guy. Her daughter was half-timelord because she was hanging out with him all the time. 

Right, even though all of that happened. By Power of Three, I saw Amy literally living her life without the Doctor. She was just fine without him, and when he did pop in, it was more like ""long time no see!"" than ""OMG MY LIFE SUCKED WITHOUT YOU!"" Even in that godawful Wardrobe Christmas special, Amy and Rory are doing fine when the Doctor comes to the door. They would always *like* him to be there, but aren't devastated when he's not. 

But anyway, after Amy and the Doctor are separated in Angels, they have kids, she writes a book, etc. Life went on after the Doctor, even if he made mess of things.",0,1409628045,null,0,false,0,ck6slah,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6slah,t1_ck6ozo2,null,1427246702,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,kde01,king,,"&gt; Usually I don't respond to these kinds of posts but it's not helpful to call your fellow fans childish if they don't like how this window was handed. Just because it is your opinion doesn't make it right, and I believe you missed the mark a few times here.
&gt; 
Did you even go into the other threads on this sub talking about lack of ambition, worst window in memory, etc etc? There are a few posters here posting a dozen times across a handful of threads complaining about lack of ambition, how we'll never be a top 4 club, and more. And I'm keeping it simple. 

It isn't just 'my opinion.' It's abject pessimism for the sake of pessimism and there's absolutely no need to snivel about the fact that we didn't sign up Falcao to show our 'intentions'...
 
&gt; 
&gt; What do you care about net spend? Where is the extra money going? It sure as hell isn't going into wages or transfers so does this do the team any good? With as much as Tottenham isn't spending on transfer, they should have a metric fuck ton for a stadium... but I highly doubt that's where the saved money is going.


So where do you think the money is going? To Levy's pockets so he can afford a long weekend in Bora Bora? No, this is going somewhere else. Maybe to the new stadium, maybe to wages, maybe to a pot we can dip into in January. You don't know just like I don't know, but I think we can both agree on the fact that we wouldn't be happy with another incoming amount like last years without a similar outgoing. The stadium is going to cost us over 400 M and we're likely to be skint during the time it's being built, so it's in our best interests to be careful how we spend our money. Net spend is only not an issue if you're Chelsea/City/Real/PSG. For the rest of us we need to pay attention or do a Leeds.
 
&gt; 
&gt; Way too early to tell if any holes have been plugged. If anything, last weekend should tell us that there is still long way to go. Unless Fazio is far better than advertised, we may be spinning our wheels here.
&gt; 

On paper we've plugged those holes. There's no question about that. You are right, though, in saying that the on-pitch performance shows we still have a ways to go. I maintain that it's just a case of fine tuning what we have now. We have the raw materials, we just need to mold them into a tight defense. 
 
&gt; 
&gt; Honestly think this is debateable. On the pitch, absolutely. However, Sandro and Holtby were two of the best morale guys on the team. I don't know the inner team dynamics, but as a leader I know that those guys are what keeps the wheel turning during the bad times. We lost two of the highest work rate guys on the team and I don't think that is debatable.
&gt; 

Workrate isn't worth anything if there's no end product. Sandro had fallen off post-injury, and we couldn't afford to keep him on any longer in the hopes that he'd return to his pre-injury self. We made a decision to sell him based on his recent performances and, in my humble opinion, we made the right decision there. 

Holtby is a harder case to swallow but if he (and we) really felt there was a serious need for constant first team play then we did the right thing by loaning him out. I don't think this is the final nail in the coffin of Holtby at Spurs, though. I think if he does well he may just return and become part of the team.
 
&gt; Great? Um... Outside of Dyer, I'm not holding my breathe for anyone else. Fazio could be a starter but all the moves are for squad players. I'd be highly surprised if more than two actually start consistently from this batch. Way too premature to even know if everyone was a decent buy, much less a great player.

I'm going to strongly disagree here. 4M for Dier is a great deal, even if he's most likely going to end up being a squad player when Walker comes back. That's just a great price for a 20 year old flexible CB with his potential. 3M for Yedlin was also good business - he showed some potential during the WC and I think we'll be able to get a good fee for him in a couple years. Fazio and Stambouli came for fairly cheap (isn't the total between these two around 12M?) for players that have consistent first team and leadership experience at clubs that have had success in the last few years. Sevilla won the EL, and Fazio played a part in that. Stambouli won Ligue 1 with Marseilles a couple years ago. These guys may not be able to slot right in at Chelsea or Real but these are the players we need to go for - unproven in the Prem with success abroad, for a solid price.

 &gt; 
&gt; I'm OK with what we sold, and knew it had to be done. Just really wish we could have sold Lennon instead of Holtby, and Dembele/Paulinho instead of Sandro. It takes about 2 years to recover from a broken leg so no wonder why Sandro didn't look as good last year.

I agree with the Lennon/Holtby comment, to a degree (see my Holtby comment above) but strongly disagree with Paulinho/Dembele vs Sandro. Sandro has shown in pre-season and last year that he's not the player he was before his injury. Sell him for 10M and bring in one of the best CDMs in Ligue 1 just seems like good business. This allows us to keep Paulinho and Dembele who play a different position to Sandro (more offensive). In the more offensive of the deep midfield 2 we have Bentaleb/Dembele/Paulinho and Capoue/Stambouli for CDM. Both Dembele and Paulinho may be able to do a job further forward if we needed them to, while Sandro is a one-trick-pony and not at the level that we need. 

&gt; 
&gt; Only complaint? We offered 24 million AND Andros for JRod! It's my opinion but JRod is overrated and for that type of offer, we could have easily snagged Griezman who was one of the best LW available. We waited until the ass end of Southampton's buyout before even making our moves, so of course SH wasn't going to sell. We wait till the end of the window before selling players which means we have now limited the amount of time to even do business because we all know that there is no way Levy is going to spend any money that does not come directly from the sales of current players. Lots more to be unhappy about.

No, we wouldn't have gotten Griezmann. Between us and Atletico there was never a contest. Atletico won La Liga and are positioning themselves well for the CL. Griezmann stated before he wanted to stay in Spain. We were never in the equation when Atletico stepped up.

The rumor was from 'Prosoccertalk,' which seems like it's part of US NBC. I didn't see anyone else reporting it, and I really don't believe this to be anything but bad information. If not, though, it doesn't seem like too terrible of a deal. 22 M USD was the reported bid and that works out to 13M GBP. Add Andros in there and it's not a terrible trade, if this (most likely BS) rumor is true.

We also tried to get Rodriguez and Schneiderlin over a month ago just after the WC ended, but Southampton were having absolutely none of it. We may have stepped back in on the last day just to see if there's something else we could offer and they stood firm. Absolutely nothing we could do here short of offer an obscene amount of money.

 
&gt; 
&gt; It is actually possible to think that this window wasn't a very good one and not be trying to stir the pot and childish. This sub is plagued by fans on both ends of the spectrum and it's posts like these that work to only divide the community instead of bringing it together.

And my comment wasn't directed at those people. It was the ones that were actually TRYING to stir the pot by complaining loudly and often that we have no ambition/we failed again/this was the worst transfer window ever/etc etc just because their favorite player got loaned out or we didn't sign some superstart.


&gt; Depending on the plan, I would give this window either a D or a C (Not including getting Poch).

D or C? That's a bit pessimistic, don't you think? I'd give it a B+, with an A being if we had gotten Schneiderlin and an A+ someone like Depay to go along with Schneiderlin (if Depay was ever willing to come to us in the first place).

 
&gt; I will say, the one thing that the one reason this offseason is overall a success is because we brought in Poch. He is going to be the X-Factor in deciding if we can buy another year for out top players. I have full faith in him and his abilities, but not our current squad. If Poch can keep the guys, then I would happily say this offseason is an A.

Your first sentence is something I totally agree with. Pochettino is the biggest buy of the window. Ferguson showed for the last few years in charge that it's not just about having the absolute best player in every position, but about making them play together. I think we have the right recipe here and I'm confident Pochettino can make the best of it. 

Yes, we may end up outside the top 4 again. In fact, I expect it. But if we make some good buys in the winter and strengthen again in key areas during the summer we can really poise ourselves for a top 4 spot. It's just not something that's going to happen overnight, especially when building a 400 M (in GBP, btw, around $660M) stadium.


&gt; Overall point of this post, just because it is your opinion doesn't make it right. Not anymore than my dumb ass opinion makes me right.

And that's not what I said. I didn't say it was right. I asked if anyone else thought this was a good window.


&gt; Don't call people who disagree with you childish. 

I didn't. It's not about who disagreed and who didn't, it's about those people on here that didn't get exactly what they wanted and felt the need to slag off the club, our ambitions, the owner, the chairman, etc. That really is just childish. Your post is one that disagrees with me without being childish, and I have no issue with it. I prefer to be able to talk things out like this as opposed to just the downvote and move on of those comments that are just wailing at the death of our club.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; ""Moffat [is] never so bad as Davies' worst moments.""

I'm forced to disagree. Davies certainly had some bad episodes in his run, but ""Curse of the Black Spot"", ""The Crimson Horror"", ""The Name of the Doctor"", and ""The Time of the Doctor"" are all much worse than Davies' worst episode (which I would classify as ""The Idiot Lantern"").

And there are several more episodes during Moffat's tenure that are in the same ballpark as ""The Idiot Lantern"": ""Victory of the Daleks"", ""The Vampires of Venice"", ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"", ""The Power of Three"", ""The Angels Take Manhattan"", ""The Snowmen"", and ""The Rings of Akhaten"".

&gt; Nearly every great episode from the Davies era was written by Moffat.

Not true. Moffat did produce absolutely fantastic material. But ""Rose"", ""Dalek"", ""Smith and Jones"", ""Human Nature / The Family of Blood"", ""Utopia"", ""Midnight"", and ""Turn Left"" would all rank on par with Moffat's contributions.

More importantly, however, how many great episodes of this quality has Moffat produced as showrunner? I would personally classify only ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""Amy's Choice"", ""Vincent and the Doctor"", ""The Pandorica Opens / The Big Bang"", ""The Doctor's Wife"", ""The Girl Who Waited"", and ""The Day of the Doctor"" on that list. This is a fraction of what Davies gave us as producer. Particularly notable is how little greatness has been produced since Season 5.

&gt; Frankly, Moffat is just more creative.

That certainly *used* to be true. But the major, glaring problem with Moffat's run is that it stopped being true awhile ago: He has been shamelessly recycling his material over and over and over again. 

(This was also a problem with Davies towards the end of his run: It became particularly noticeable with ""Voyage of the Damned"" as Davies tried to retell the entire story of Rose in a single episode. And then the 2008-2010 specials for the 10th Doctor were particularly blighted by it. It was one of the reasons why I felt it was time for Davies to leave the show: When you've told all the Doctor Who stories you've got to tell, it's time to stop telling Doctor Who stories.)

As just one example, consider his season finales: The Series 5 finale featured a misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor that resulted in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's prepped a loophole and can come back.

Then the Series 6 finale featured a misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor that resulted in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's prepped a loophole that allows him to come back. (Only this time the loophole is actually just a deus ex machina.)

Then the Series 7 finale featured (I can't even make this up) a misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor that resulted in the creation of an apocalyptic alternate reality and Clara is forced to sacrifice herself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out that there's a loophole that will allow the Doctor to save Clara by sacrificing himself... only he can come back because... well... actually, Moffat didn't even bother trying to provide an explanation.

The last one gets bonus points because the initial ""Doctor is doomed"" scenario is resolved by the deus ex machina of Clara jumping into his timestream at the cost of her own life. But then Clara is saved through the deus ex machina of the Doctor being able to walk into his own timestream to save her. The cost of that deus ex machina is established as ""he'll totally be dead if he does it"" and then he avoids being dead because... deus ex machina. Moffat managed to get a deus ex machina in his deus ex machina in his deus ex machina. A triple crown of shitty writing.

But you can also see this in other aspects of Moffat's writing: For example, this season we've seen him go back to the ""middle-aged psychopath who's in love with the Doctor"" well for the *third* time. And even the very last episode (""Into the Dalek"") takes a retread of ""Asylum of the Daleks"", mixes it with a retread of ""Dalek"", and then spices lightly with the ""miniaturized people inside a robot are attacked by robotic antibodies"" thing that we saw in ""Let's Kill Hitler"".

&gt; But Moffat’s writing of his companions (...) seem far less sexist than Davies’ writing of Rose Tyler...

I can't even begin to process this statement. It would be like someone claiming that the writing of Captain Jack was homophobic.

Of course, the author also claims that Moffat doesn't use deus ex machina. So it's possible they're watching a version of the show from some alternate dimension.",0,1409632573,null,0,false,0,ck6udrw,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6udrw,t3_2f63ki,null,1427245866,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; Who knows, maybe I'm still sore over the fact that Moffatt essentially retconned the whole damn Davis run in his first episode (It happened, but only he remembers now? Fuck that.)

In Season 5 it actually seemed as if Moffat was deliberately deconstructing some of Davies' excesses and over-used tropes:

* Using the cracks to reset the significant separation from the reality of contemporary London in Doctor Who and the real world.

* Deliberately introducing a young waif and having the Doctor categorically reject her advances.

* Having the Doctor stand up and give on of his big ""I'm the Doctor!"" speeches in ""The Pandorica Opens""... only to reveal that his hubris was actually being used against him to set a trap.

true,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,"My thoughts:

It is pretty tough to rate West Ham's summer. 

We got rid of 16 players, but only sold 4 of them outright. Of the four sold, only Diame went for any real money. 3/4 of the players we lost were released on free transfers or expiring loans, which means we made no money while trimming our fat.

On the other hand we added 9 players, and I feel significantly better about the depth of the squad for this season. We upgraded our strike force and our midfield. We also got a significant boost at LB.

We ignored a major need at CB and that I find worrying. We have only three on roster and one (Reid) is unsettled. I am worried about relying on the youngster Burke for Premier League depth.

Notable Additions: Alex Song (Loan), Mauro Zarate (Free), Chiekhou Kouyate (£7.5M), Enner Valencia (£12M), Aaron Cresswell (£4M)

Notable Losses: Mohamed Diame (£3.5M), Joe Cole (Free), Jack Collison (Free), Matt Taylor (Free), George McCartney (Free), Modibo Maiga (Loan)

Mancini's reactions to Mario's behavior seemed to serve as the primer for the media's coverage. Think back a few years to when Mario missed that spinning backheel goal in preseason and Mancini acted like he had just doomed civilization. I think Mancini hurt Mario's reputation more than Mario has because if you go back and read the stuff Mancini said it was out of line and always public. With 20/20 hindsight I think Friedel is spot on.

With a player like Mario, you have to have the attitude of ""lol he tried that backheel are you srs?"" rather than ""OMG HE TRIED THAT BACKHEEL WHAT A DISGRACE.""

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Let's take a moment to review the Silence: The Silence are established as having created a vast network of tunnels beneath the surface of the Earth and secretly ruling humanity for centuries. Okay. Later you reveal that the Silence are actually just genetically modified priests loyal to Kovarian and their only purpose on Earth was to raise Melody Pond. So Madame Kovarian decided the most efficient way to get control of an orphanage in Florida in the 1960s was to have the Silence secretly rule over mankind for hundreds of years? And then, when they needed a space suit, the only way Kovarian -- who, it should be noted, has also been established as controlling an entire fleet of papal soldiers with spaceships -- can think of to get a spacesuit is to literally create the U.S.-Russia space race?

The ""revelation"" that the Silence were always working for Kovarian was the lynchpin that turned the entire Silence arc-plot into utter nonsense.

(The arc-plot had already received a pretty hefty body blow in the form of Kovarian's assassination plan being revealed as total nonsense a season earlier: She goes through vast efforts to kidnap Melody. She employs huge machinations to raise her as a psychopathic killer. But then her assassination plan has nothing to do with her being Melody or River or a Time Lord. Instead, River is put into a spacesuit, teleported to a random location, and then forced to shoot the Doctor. None of that makes any sense even before we get to the fixed point that's a fixed point because it's a fixed point but it's not actually a fixed point nonsense and deus ex machina that Moffat used to ""resolve"" that plot.)",0,1409633544,null,0,false,0,ck6upvr,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6upvr,t1_ck6cqx1,null,1427245709,-1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-1

true,PeppermintGhost,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"I have seen all of the Fourth and Fifth Doctor episodes and the majority of the Sixth.

In regards to those episodes, the shows are cheesy and feature the occasional bad acting and almost always bad special effects. That's part of its charm though.

I think the writing on the modern series is better because they do a better job at establishing drama and character development. The original series didn't do much to flesh out the Doctor or his companions (regenerations are just kind of a thing that happens and not treated like the events that they are in the modern series... though they did try to give some emotion to Tom Baker's ending but I think they fell short). The Doctor &amp; companions simply traveled from one place to another, fixed whatever needed fixing, repeat. Also, the series/seasons were broken down into serials that ran anywhere between 2-6 30 minute episodes; most serials ran for 4 episodes. There are some lulls and dull spots in the show because of this.

If you're not into cheesy, creaky (literally, some of those sets are so flimsy) old movies and TV shows, I doubt the classic series will change your mind.

I think the classic series is fun. Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor was magnificent. It was Tom that officially made me a Whovian. He's the best Doctor of them all, IMO. It's just a shame that the writing couldn't always rise to his level of acting and the persona of the Fourth Doctor but he ran into some memorable aliens, companions and worlds during his run. Thehis run featured a lot of gothic horror. The producers at the time were very much inspired by the Universal horror films and Hammer horror films.

Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor was likable but kinda bland, as were the episodes themselves. Davison felt a bit too normal, not eccentric enough (other than having a sprig of celery). Always seemed perplexed and out of his element. The Master got a lot of story time during this era.

Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor is very enjoyable and seems to have brought back more of the weirdness from the Fourth Doctor run. Six feels like an amped up version of Fourth Doctor -- more arrogant, more prone to anger, sharp-tongue humor, less warmth. Like Tom Baker, Colin was wonderful at playing such an eccentric Doctor.

true,RuinAllTheThings,smith,Smith,"I agree that they can both be guilty of it. With RTD, it seemed blatant - and there is some blatant *magicness* to Moffat's endings, I don't disagree. Doctor is trapped on the other side of the cracks of the universe, Amelia Pond.. brings him back by being reminded he ever existed? It felt odd, yet not out of place, because of how generally screwy her past was, never explaining what had happened to her parents. I could go with the idea that the crack in her wall all her life had given her a capability to violate that sort of weird necessity.

But in general, I can go along with 11's second series without much of a problem, except in what has become a bit more common with Moffat, he does sort of drop things. The Silence disappears after *The Wedding of River Song* until the end of 11's run, and only then a backhanded explanation is given for Madame Kovarian that lasts an entire two sentences. That was a huge part of the previous series and deserved more, but it had all been left dangling for no particular reason. It wasn't like those two sentences wrapped up and gave a *good* explanation.

I can get the general critique of Moffat, and it's a critique I share, but I hardly feel he's *ruined* Doctor Who. What is there to ruin, based on some pretty rough patches with RTD? It's different, absolutely. My hope is that with Capaldi, Moffat just.. stops trying so damned hard to be clever. It doesn't have to be an enigma wrapped in a mystery, slathered in secret sauce and covered in riddlebits, but it is secretly a puzzle being piloted by the Teselcta who've been replaced by Dalek shells, but are also somehow members of UNIT.",0,1409635268,null,0,false,0,ck6vajw,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6vajw,t1_ck6uv21,null,1427245441,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"I actually don't object to ""The Pandorica Opens"" resolution: Moffat actually did a great job of establishing that remembering something can bring it back from beyond the Cracks throughout the season; re-established it in the finale; showed it actually happening; had the Doctor take explicit actions to set it up (which had also been foreshadowed through the entire season); and only then used it to save the Doctor.

It's actually a great example of how you can set up ""magical"" stuff while not having it be a deus ex machina.

But after Series 5, Moffat has embraced deus ex machina like some sort of long lost lover.

&gt; I hardly feel he's ruined Doctor Who. 

For me, personally, he's ruined the show enough that I am very unlikely to continue watching it after the next episode. (I would have quit after ""The Time of the Doctor"", but decided to give Capaldi a shot. Now I'm basically waiting for an episode that wasn't directred by Wheatley to pass final judgment on what has, so far, been another disappointing series.)

My assessment of RTD's run is pretty consistent: There's usually one mediocre episode per series and then I'm vaguely disappointed by the deus ex machina in the finale, but there are multiple great episodes strung together by good episodes. The 2008-2010 specials were terrible.

My assessment of Moffat's run looks like this:

**Series 5**: Moffat's episodes are generally excellent (although ""The Beast Below"" was mediocre), but there were a significant number of bad episodes (""Victory of the Daleks"", ""Vampires of Venice"", ""Cold Blood""). The finale was excellent.

**Series 6**: At the time, I thought Moffat's scripts in this season were pretty strong. In retrospect, however, they fall apart pretty badly (neither the Silence nor the assassination plot make a lick of sense). Even at the time, ""Let's Kill Hitler"" was a doubly-squandered opportunity (tossing away both the revelation that River is Mel and River's redemption). And ""The Wedding of River Song"" is absolutely dreadful. As we still have absolutely dreadful episodes like ""The Curse of the Black Spot"".

**Series 7**: This was dreadful. ""Asylum of the Daleks"" was the only episode that I would classify as good (and even that episode has *severe* problems). Moffat's writing continues to fall apart -- it's sloppy, repetitive, and relies heavily on deus ex machina. The episodes written by other people are no better, with ""The Crimson Horror"" distinguishing itself as the worst episode in the entirety of nuWho. ""The Name of the Doctor"" rounds things out by providing the worst season finale in all of nuWho: Incoherent, repetitive, and nonsensical.

""The Day of the Doctor"" was excellent with the exception of Moffat's horrendously simplistic interpretation of the Time War (which, thankfully, can be largely ignored). It actually got my hopes up, but then ""The Time of the Doctor"" squashed those hopes flat: Terrible television on an epic scale.

I discuss the failures ""Deep Breath"" [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2egyyf/deep_breath_reaction_challenge/ck02rb7). ""Into the Dalek"" is better than ""Deep Breath"" (a very low bar to clear), but is basically a retread of ""Asylum of the Daleks"" mixed with a retread of ""Dalek"" and then spiced lightly with the ""miniaturized people inside a robot get attacked by robotic antibodies"" thing we saw in ""Let's Kill Hitler"". The only notable thing in either of these episodes is that Moffat appears to have added ""let me repeat the thematic statement of the episode over and over and over again in a hamfisted fashion"" to his repertoire of crappy writing techniques.

I find all of this deeply depressing. Partly because it has ruined the show for me. But also because seeing an author who was once capable of producing master pieces like ""The Empty Child"" and ""Blink"" reduced to what Moffat is producing today is very, very sad.",0,1409636981,null,0,false,0,ck6vst3,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6vst3,t1_ck6vajw,null,1427245205,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,ashmaht,tardis,TARDIS,"None of that is really all that ridiculous (or at least no more ridiculous than DW usually is) if you look mainly at the motivations involved here. 

First and foremost, the church is not at all ""moral"" in any sense, as evidenced by entities like the Headless Monks. They're pretty much fascists, and kind of dickish ones at that. Someone who rose to power like Kovarian is therefore probably not a nice person.

Now, with that said, the Kovarian chapter breaks off in an effort to destroy the Doctor. Do you realize what a gargantuan task that would be? As has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, Moffat's Doctor is essentially a god. It takes the combined armies of all his greatest villains just to subdue him briefly.

So, how do you stop something like that? Careful observation and planning. The Doctor protects Earth. It's what he does. So you go to Earth and you take over. You alter the battlefield to your advantage. What next? Well you have to look for opportunities to take out the greatest weapon the Doctor has: his time machine. 

Somehow you need to get inside the time machine and blow it the hell up. Provided you've figured that out, now it's a matter of *actually killing The Doctor.*

How do you kill a god?

With something he won't see coming. But the god is clever, he sees everything. So it has to be something he won't fight. Like, let's say the child of the two people he seems to care about most in the world. If we're talking Eleventh Doctor (which we are), then that's the Ponds. But what if just being their daughter isn't enough? Well the Doctor is alone in the universe. Surely another Time Lord could stay his hand? So you make your assassin both the child of the Doctor's best friends, and half Time Lord.

Then there's the issue of how you get River Song to do what you want her to do. As a child, Melody has her strength and regeneration energy focused through a space suit, specifically engineered for her (the Kovarian chapter needed a self-sustaining assassin but, not being scientists, had to have humans design it indirectly). But the child is unpredictable and escapes.

Still, you're playing the long game. Your subliminal indoctrination and brainwashing go fairly well, and manifest their effects as the child grows. See, when we first meet River (chronologically), she attempts to kill the Doctor twice. First, as Melody, she shoots the TARDIS with a gun. Then she tries to poison the Doctor as River. He survives both attempts and River is swayed. 

Still, the Doctor shows a clear aversion to fighting River. That part of the plan holds up. So she is recaptured and put into the space suit, which will focus her power and control her physically.

You know from historical records that your initial attempts at killing the Doctor were misguided. He has a set death day and it has to be stuck to. It's a fixed point in time. However, unbeknownst to you, the records have been misinformed. All that happens that day by Lake Silencio is that River shoots at the Doctor and his body is burned.

Only it isn't his body at all. It's the teselecta. The fixed point remains, no paradox. And, no, that's not a deus ex machina as the plot point was introduced earlier in the season, not just cobbled together at the end.

It all makes sense, but we're not fed every single detail and much of it happens out of order because of River's timeline. 

I won't agree with the poster who said that Moffat doesn't write the occasional subpar episode (every writer does), but he's not a bad writer overall (in fact, his dialogue is superb, he has amazing ideas, and he isn't intent on spoon-feeding his audience every plot detail unless it's a question of whether or not Vastra and Jenny are married lesbians), and I don't think the Silence plot line is an example of poor writing at all.",0,1409638352,null,0,false,0,ck6w60y,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6w60y,t1_ck6upvr,null,1427245034,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Here's why: 

&gt;The term ""road tax"" is commonly used when referring to ""Vehicle Excise Duty"". despite its common usage though, this use is controversial, because many motorists wrongly believe that the proceeds from VED are used to fund the roads and even that the roads are funded solely from this tax; there is no such thing as road tax. Peter Walker, a journalist at the guardian: ""I've always felt the road tax argument supports a more general feeling of entitlement among too many drivers. Those who trot it out often seem to genuinely treat cyclists like we're interlopers who should be pushed aside"".


In an opinion piece on the BBC Magazine website, a journalist explored this argument in 2013, suggesting how the term ""road tax"" is used by some drivers as a badge of entitlement to hog the road and drive badly, even intentionally hitting cyclists to argue their point.


All tax payers, not just motorists, pay proportionately for the roads, and cyclists impose minimal wear and tear on them. The Cambridge Cycle Campaign suggested that ""Arguing that cyclists therefore have less right to use the roads is like arguing that smokers should take precedence for medical treatment, because non-smokers don't buy cigarettes and therefore 'don't pay hospital tax"".


A small straw poll of 20 people by the BBC's Roger Harrabin in 2013 showed the term ""road tax"" is still in wide usage by the public, with 15 people using it in his poll and believing the tax paid exclusively for road upkeep.


In a BBC report in May 2010 about a cyclist who was knocked off his bike by a car the presenter read out a series of emails from viewers expressing the view that 'cyclists should pay road tax' if they wish to use the roads. After receiving a 'huge number' of complaints from viewers following publicity created by iPayRoadTax, the BBC broadcast a second piece which clarified the fact that roads are paid for out of general taxation. The term ""road tax"" is often incorrectly used when referring to ""vehicle excise duty"" in the UK media.


When challenged by iPayRoadTax, the British consumer magazine *Which?*, defended its continued use of the term on the basis that ""road tax"" was more commonly used than Vehicle Excise Duty. A spokesman also said that while they would not stop using the terms 'car tax' and 'road tax' online that they would endeavour to also make appropriate reference to the full name of the tax.


One organisation that appears to be content with the current use of 'road tax' as the vernacular for VED is the advertising standards authority. Complaints that advertisements using the term are incorrect are rejected with what appears to be a templated letter stating ""although we acknowledge that the correct term is 'Vehicle Excise Duty', more commonly used phrases such as 'Road Tax' are often used by advertisers to convey a message in a way that will be understood by the widest audience""[.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Excise_Duty)

Our defence certainly looks better, but it still has some holes. Like I said, we looked very very vulnerable on the counter. Kaboul was terrible and it could've easily been 5 or 6. Our midfield is currently lacking. Paulinho is currently not good and we should not be pinning our chances on the hope that someone will regain some form. Currently we rely on Lamela and Eriksen for almost all our attacking spark. Eriksen hasn't quite been up to his usual standard the first couple of games, Lamela, I thought, was fouled out of the game and he was visibly frustrated by this. Chadli and Adebayor do not create much at all and we don't have a traditional deep lying play maker in Bentaleb or Capoue, they primarily link the defence and the midfield and anchor the team. Scheniderlin showed on the weekend that he's able to have a big impact in attack - something that would've been fantastic against Liverpool.

In regards to ""not supporting our manager"", I understand that we tried, what I mean is that we have failed too many times. We should've been in for him before they let all their other players go as to avoid this saga. We also failed on J-rod who they seemed more open to selling. Whilst I agree Levy has looked like he is 100% supportive of Poch, we need to see this support materialise, which we failed to do this transfer window.

Agree with your point re: Bentaleb. The fact is we are using him as a first choice midfielder though, not as a young player who needs experience. He started against Liverpool (when we should be playing our 100% strongest side) and if Bentaleb is the best option we currently have in that position, I feel like we are lacking there.

Maybe I'm being impatient, but considering we had a negative net spend this window, it seems there was a lot more room to move, why wait until winter to start moving?

That said I'm sure that consumer credit drives a lot.  I think back to 2006, my friends thought I was crazy to spend £250 on a mobile phone.  But it had a web browser, and I could program it in a nice language, not some fraken framework in C++ Nokia Series 60 which I had before.  

Thing is, I was newly rich, having graduated uni for the first time ever I had disposable income, woo!  So I splurged, stretching myself somewhat that month, to buy the phone.  Everyone thought I was nuts to spend so much on a phone, after all the feature phones at £100 would do all that it did and more.

The iPhone came out.  It worked out at a cost of £1800.  At the time I was working in a equity trading environment.  We were all joking about, *this is stupid, no one can afford that, no one will buy them, Apple need to focus on the iPod*.  We thought it would be a flop, it was slow, awful battery life and couldn't even play third party games on it.  What we handed taken into account is how many people would spend such a sum on credit.

The fact is people who couldn't have afforded an iPod could now buy an iPhone.

A few years later, people don't blink at the idea of buying a £500 phone.

*edit I've just worked out that if the duty on fuel is 61%, I'm also paying an additional £2781 in tax per year via fuel.

But I have a car that lives in a garage, it's lucky if it does 1000 miles a year, and I pay £280 ish to tax that, what's that all about?


So I just looked into public transport.

Home to work 17.5 miles, one way

3 min walk
13 min bus
4 min walk
27 min metro
5 min walk
14 min bus
13 min walk

1 hour 19 of travel, with waiting the total journey is 1 hour 51, each way!

Sadly, the earliest public transport could get me there is 7:41, which is almost an hour later than I need to be there.

In my car it takes around 30 mins each way, and depending on how I drive can cost £10-15 a day, for me it's a no brainer

true,JRugman,null,null,"Some points that might explain this decision:

1. The £47 billion cost and 7 year construction period estimated by the Thames Estuary airport backers does not include the delivery and operation of all the high speed rail lines and central London terminals that are neccessary to keep the airport running. That would add a minimum additional £10 billion to the project.

2. The developers proposed that the £45 billion value of the old Heathrow airport site be 'partially captured', but didn't suggest how this would be done.

3. No time frame was given for the redevelopment of the old Heathrow airport site, which was meant to provide housing for 300,000 people and 200,000 jobs. Consider that the airport currently provides 136,600 direct and indirect jobs in London, which would all be either lost or relocated at great expense. Consider also that previous estimates of the development potential of the Heathrow site have been much lower (80,000 homes / 43,500 jobs according to TfL).

4. Did they seriously expect 172 million passengers per year and a hundred thousand or so workers to all travel to the airport by rail? That would mean building a rail line with a capacity more than double the busiest line that currently operates - double decker high speed trains running every 5-10 mins. You're also talking about feeding almost all these passengers straight into Kings Cross, Crossrail, or HS1, all of which which would struggle to cope with the extra traffic. 

5. According to the National Air Traffic Services, an estuary airport would result in more planes flying at a lower altitude over central London, since they'd be heading west on take-off and would need to avoid the airspace of other London airports. It would also mean landing approaches being pushed eastwards into Dutch and Belgian airspace, who would probably want to reserve it for their own airports. Even if they were open to the idea, diverting the main flightpaths serving northwest europe would result in an increase in fuel use and emissions by airlines using them.

6. If the main goal is to reduce noise suffered by residents under the Heathrow flight path, then for £50 billion you could buy out and rehouse everyone inside the 57dB noise contour, unifying Windsor Great Park, Hounslow Heath, Osterley Park, Kew Gardens, Gunnersbury Park, Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common … if not further into London … as a nature reserve.

The main question that needs to be resolved is whether London even needs a single hub airport. Historically, we've benefitted from the access to US markets, for which London is much better placed than any other major EU city (Eire excepted), but for flights to growing BRICS economies other airports in europe are geographically better placed. The recent interim report from the Davies Commission made it clear that the need for a UK hub airport is not as urgent as the corporations behind Heathrow Airport or Boris Island would have us believe.

The main beneficiaries of an expanded hub airport serving London would be the owners of the airport (which may, like Heathrow, be as much a foreign-owned mechanism for tax avoidance as it is a place for people to fly to other countries) and the major airlines serving long-haul routes. The problem with trying to capture a share of a global market is that the companies involved are likely to be based outside the UK, so the economic benefit to the UK may end up being marginal.

How much faith do we have in the projections of massively increasing demand for air travel over the next 50-100 years? Given the constraints on fuel and space that may be faced, is it not better to add capacity incrementally (which is a clear possibility at Gatwick and Stansted), and focus our national infrastructure planning on projects that actually serve the people of the UK?",0,1409643405,null,0,false,0,ck6xbsj,t3_2f79e8,t1_ck6xbsj,t3_2f79e8,null,1427244492,53,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,53

* London's airport plans and the decisions to stick with adding extra runways at Heathrow or Gatwick (both of which have serious drawbacks) rather than future proofing with a new terminal. 

* [Rising rail fares](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28842633)

* (And in other news: my local monthly bus fare went up £7 in the last six months - the service is often late, crowded and sometimes buses disappear completely off the 'arrivals' board at the city centre departure). 

In other words I have little faith that public transport will be improving any time soon. It needs to. 

You have to make people *want* to move on from driving - pricing them out of it is not the proactive answer for the future. We want better transport, not 'the only one that doesn't leave me bankrupt' transport...

Also just check out his pictures crying with Materazzi as he left Inter. When a manager like that has an attitude about Mario that's jovial and light-hearted rather than Mancini's which was sour then I think Brendan who has learned under Mourinho will feel the same.

I feel like the fact that Brendan worked under Mourinho is extremely underrated. In American football for example a lot of new head coaches come straight from working as an assistant under some other really highly respected coach (see Bill Belichek's coaching family tree). I like that Brendan was able to learn from a manager who I think is the best.

I also agree with OP (of this child thread) - that selling a car is a PITA. I recently sold an old laptop that was only worth £300 and the hassle, time and dodging scammers was seriously annoying.

Yes it does suck to lose both Holtby and Sandro on the last day. On their day they were both excellent players and probably two of the most liked players at the club. Spurs TV will be empty without them.  
  
But, Sandro just hasn't looked the same at all since he did his knee and has struggled to stay fit. With Poch wanting a leaner smaller squad and the high tempo never stop pressing game he likes to play, much as it pains me to say this, it makes sense to play him.   
  
Holtby for me is a tricky one. I (like most of us on here) love the guy, I thought he had a really good pre-season, and with his seemingly limitless energy supply I though he would fit Poch's system well. However, outside of Europa games he's never astounded me with his performances. He seems a safe option, not one who will change a game. I'd also make the point that this is now the third Spurs manager to not really fancy him as well as Fulham's manager, so maybe there's something we don't see...   
  
We've done what we needed to make the squad smaller. We've kept all of our best players and strengthened our back line. Particularly in terms of cover. I think if we're to do well what we need is consistency and to just have a settled club, we're going to need to trust in Poch if we are to achieve this, not kick up a shitstorm every time a player who's likeable gets sold. Yes it's sad but we should probably remember, likable doesn't win you anything.

The thing that isn't being discussed about the independence debate, and really it's the ONLY thing that matters, is that yes, obviously Scotland will have a smaller economy than it does now. It won't be turned into slumland Mumbai, but the economy will shrink at first. BUT it will be able to elect more left wing governments than it does now because Scotland ALWAYS votes left wing. And that's not just Labour forever, that's an immediate shift to what is now centre left, and then the eventual establishment of two parties which sit slightly to the side of the new ""centre"" which is more left than it is now. So Scotland could get a lot of more socialist policies in, more wealth equality, but the overall wealth would be down. In terms I understand, this means Scotland will start ordering a smaller Pizza, but the slices will be more fairly cut, so people with big slices now get smaller slices, but most people get bigger slices even though the total pizza is smaller.

How this works out with the UK below them offering bigger pizza slices to people who help order the pizza is the guess of people smarter than me who use non-pizza analogies. But this is really the only issue that makes sense to debate, but it hasn't been, not really. Does Scotland want to forgo economic strength, to achieve more equality?

All the available research shows that cyclists live *longer* than everyone else&amp;dagger;. So these terrible risk factors either a) aren't that terrible after all or b) are outweighed by the benefits of cycling.

In answer to your particular points: 1) The pollution levels inside cars are measured to be *worse* than the outside air, so cyclists are actually breathing higher quality air than car drivers. Don't be fooled by the big clouds of crap put out by dirty diesel engines - your lungs are pretty good at removing that stuff. It's the tiny particulates that are the real problem. 2) Yes, cycling carries risks. So does getting up in the morning, yet we manage to do that every day. The accident rate for experienced cyclists is very low - as with all things road related the inexperienced teenagers skew the accident rates enormously. If you're not already an experienced cyclist, then getting yourself on a proper cycling course (run by an organisation like the CTC) is the best way to become one in the shortest possible time.

Current cyclists tend to be better off than the UK median so you have to pick equivalent populations in order to get a fair comparison.",0,1409646261,null,0,1409646716,0,ck6xvw1,t3_2f6678,t1_ck6xvw1,t1_ck6csup,null,1427244220,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,citizenfaith,scottish,"Edinburgh raised, Glasgow residing","Difficult to say for sure, but it probably wouldn't affect you very much at all. I imagine there would be a certain degree of soul-searching by the politicians ""how did we let this happen"" etc, but the effect on the populous would be pretty minimal. I doubt it would have much effect on the way people vote in rUK, because although the Conservatives would have been the govt of the day, it's Labour who are leading the No campaign, so it probably balances out. In the longer term, it could have a big effect on the Labour party as they will no longer be able to rely on the block of consistent votes they receive from Scotland. This could result in a major shake-up and the party may try and reconnect with its left-wing roots to try and win back the working class, or they might just unimaginatively carry on down the same course and keep crowding the middle (as that middle drifts ever further to the right). In the event of the latter, you may see a new left wing movement emerge, but you might just see politics in rUK becoming more and more like politics in the USA with a choice between two right wing parties and no other real alternative. If (as I hope) an independent Scotland is (a) significantly to the left, and (b) successful, then that could change things politically in rUK as it would become a lot more difficult to pass off the right wing policies as ""the only possible option"" and it would hopefully bolster the argument on the left for a more progressive and equal society. Also, if there is a referendum on leaving the EU, without the Scottish votes there's a higher chance that rUK will vote to exit. I suppose you might see a stronger push for regional devolution within rUK as well, but I don't know enough about that to say either way.

In terms of economics, Scotland is a net contributor - the percentage of the total tax that comes from Scotland is higher than the percentage of the total spend that goes to Scotland - but the difference is pretty tiny, so I doubt there will be any significant effect on the rUK economy in terms of the size of the deficit. You could see a slight difference in the cost of govt borrowing as the loss of a portion of the overall economy (not to mention the oil reserves) might make rUK slightly riskier as an investment, and you might see an effect on interest rates or the value of the pound if there is no currency union as the balance of payments would change (Scotland does a surprisingly large amount of exporting), but again I think these changes are likely to be fairly small. Bear in mind that the population of Scotland is roughly equivalent to the population of Yorkshire, so the overall effect on the UK economy is not going to be massive and I would imagine London will be particularly isolated from whatever effects there are as London is practically a separate economy all on its own.

In short, I don't think it would affect you very much at all, but the difference it could make for the people of Scotland is huge.",0,1409646270,null,0,false,0,ck6xvy4,t3_2f8lm6,t1_ck6xvy4,t3_2f8lm6,null,1427244219,72,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,72

I do think that the argument is between the South-East and Scotland, with the rest of the UK watching nervously from the side lines.

Scotland matters to the rest of the UK, you are a part of our national identity. We have a great shared history that has allowed us to become the nations, and Country that we are today. 

Without Scotland, the rest of the Union will be weaker, and more focused on the South-East of England. The rest of the UK will suffer as a result of Scottish independence. It will be significant, but it will only be 20 years down the line that we know the full impacts.

true,iomex,eng-devon,Devon,"I knew it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. We see it all the time on the news - about how local councils bollocks things up and vulnerable children get abused.

But this is more than a bollocks-up - a Mayor knowingly vouched for a rapist. The Mayor should know the ins and outs of the licensing system and should know that a convicted rapist should never be badged in any licensing district. 

I would go so far as to say it was his title which swayed the council into making that decision.

Fortunately, the vast majority of councils are EXTREMELY strict on this sort of thing. Violence and deceit are two things they will not tolerate.

My own personal example is that 5 years before I applied - I had a small bump in the Sainsbury's car park - so small that I didn't even notice it. I ended up getting convicted of failing to stop/report an accident. Because of this, the council very, very nearly refused my application as that was a sign of deception. It was only when I showed them the exact nature of the circumstances they granted my application.

Procedures have recently changed at my council - I don't know about other councils, but they have protocols with insurers and the police. Anything that happens to your driving license or criminal record gets reported to the council - and they obtain your DBS by themselves - eliminating the risk of people 'hiding' convictions.

Unfortunately this case shows us what happens when a rapist scumbag uses a corrupt, morally deficient politician to lean on pushover licensing officers.

However, Scotland pays £10,000 per head in tax, compared with £9,200 for the rest of the UK, that's an £800 difference. so basically Scottish people cost the UK £1,300 more per year, but only pay £800 per year. that's a £500 per person difference. there are around 11 times as many people in the rest of the UK as in Scotland, so assuming getting rid of Scotland, everyone in the rest of the UK will be £45 per year better off, on average. which isn't really very much, however London has a population of 8.3 million people, and that £45 per head means London as a whole will be about £376 million better off, and the UK as a whole will be about £2.6 billion better off.

&gt;The researcher, who does not want to be named, told BBC Panorama the draft of her final report was sent to the Home Office and Rotherham Council on a Friday.
...
&gt;Panorama also spoke to Dr Angie Heal, who was employed by South Yorkshire Police to investigate drugs crime in 2003. She quickly identified links with sexual exploitation.

Well, this is an interesting development. I had assumed that the researcher and Dr Heal were one and the same - with Dr Heal subsequently being hired by South Yorkshire Police to continue her drug-related research as had been exposed in the initial period. It now seems that there are at least *two* different researchers, Dr Angie Heal and this mystery researcher (I think I might have a line on where to find out who that is) who for the moment we'll call Researcher A. 

So at this point, South Yorkshire Police are looking incredibly bad. Truly fucking awful, in fact. From paragraphs 10.19 &amp; 10.20, we know that Dr Heal made at least two reports between 2002 and 2006, along with six monthly updates that were circulated to everyone important in the area - Police District Commanders, Superintendents, CID, numerous community outreach programs. These things were being sent out like massive incandescent beams from a lighthouse, but nothing was done.

&gt;10.19 In 2002, South Yorkshire Police and their partners appointed Dr Angie Heal, a
strategic drugs analyst, to carry out research on drug use, drug dealing and related
problems in the county. She was based with South Yorkshire Police and did this
research in the period 2002-2006. She produced several 'stand alone’ reports,
including the two referred to here, as well as six-monthly updates. The two reports
had a similar format of looking at the overall position in South Yorkshire, as well as
examining each of the four policing areas separately i.e. Rotherham, Doncaster,
Barnsley and Sheffield.

&gt;10.20 **As a minimum, these reports went to each South Yorkshire Police District
Commander, Chief Superintendents and Superintendents in Specialist Crime
Services (CID) and Community Safety. They also went to Drug Action Coordinators,
NHS and voluntary sector drug agencies as well as organisations working with
children and adults involved in exploitation and prostitution. They also went to the
Central Government office for the North East. Latterly, they were also sent to the
Partnership Police Inspectors who were attached to each local authority Community
Safety Partnership, as well as the Principal Community Safety Officers in each of the
local authorities in the county.** It became clear to Dr Heal at an early stage that there
were important links between drugs, drug dealing and child sexual exploitation, which- 88 -
she continued to highlight to her funding partners in her reports and updates
throughout her employment as a researcher.

South Yorkshire Police are probably shredding hundreds of documents as we speak. We now know that not only did they ignore (and try to censure) Dr Heal, but they also ignored the home office report from this unknown Researcher A. 

**So thats at least three separate reports (ignoring the six monthly updates that Heal did) completely ignored, in the time period 2001-2006, all with heavy research behind them.**

&gt;That weekend, someone visited the offices of a youth organisation where she had been based, without permission.

&gt;She said there had not been a break-in, but: ""They'd gained access to the office and taken my data, so out of the number of filing cabinets there was one drawer emptied and it was emptied of my data.

[This fits with something the Telegraph had last week, where the offices of Risky Business were turned over soon after the report was made known.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11062758/Scandal-hit-Rotherham-deleted-abuse-files.html)

&gt;In 2002 high profile personnel at Rotherham Council ordered a raid on Risky Business, Rotherham council’s specialist youth service, which offered one-to-one help and support to vulnerable teenage girls, ahead of the findings of a draft report, according to the Times.
The raid was to remove case files and wipe computer records detailing the scale and severity of the town’s sex-grooming crisis, sources told The Times.

Also, the Rani's control center was lower than the Doctor's:

To go further: lets say we spend £50 million on someone for a 5 year contract, we would deduct £50 million in cash, and add £50million in intangible assets, which would be amortised at about £12 million per year.

So if we spent £88 million this summer all on 5 year contracts then really it will cost us about £18 million in additional expense this season.

Conversely when we sell a player we gain the transfer fee in cash assets, but deduct whatever the remaining asset value of that player is. So for example David Luiz, we signed for £25 million on a 5 year deal, probably had what, 2 years remaining? That means he would have been about £10 million on the books. We deduct that and gain £50 million in cold hard cash, that's a profit on our account of £40 million right there.

You wrote a lot of words, but you failed to explain *any* of the stupidities pointed out in the comment you were replying to. I guess we can just assume that you're conceding those are all really stupid things Moffat wrote, then?

&gt; You know from historical records that your initial attempts at killing the Doctor were misguided. He has a set death day and it has to be stuck to. It's a fixed point in time.

Which is another thing: You know it can't possibly be a fixed point in time where he dies because you've already met him at a point in his personal timeline *after* Lake Silencio.

You wanna change the past? More power to you. You wanna hinge your plan to change the past on a moment in time that you know you cannot possibly change? Wow. That's... impressive in its stupidity.

Just another example of Moffat's obsession with time travel running headlong into Moffat's inability to grasp how time travel works.

&gt; Only it isn't his body at all. It's the teselecta. The fixed point remains, no paradox. 

The tesselecta which, it should be noted, was *explicitly* established as not being able to subvert fixed points in its first appearance. Why is it suddenly able to subvert the fixed point at the end of the season? Because Steven Moffat waved his hands and shouted, ""Deus ex machina!"" at the top of his lungs. (It's the same ""magic"" spell he would invoke one season later when he needed to explain how the Doctor could walk back out of his personal timeline mere minutes after establishing that it was impossible.)

At the moment, the UK orders pizza. South East England is paying for a lot of it, and areas like the highlands, Wales and Cornwall are not chipping in that much but taking their slices.

In iScotland the more equal pizza slices would probably, over time, result in the monthly pizza orders only growing in size slowly, remaining the same size or possibly shrinking. 

Within 30 years you would expect there to be strong calls in some areas of iScotland to divide it less equally (particularly the more prosperous regions that are the ones who are actually buying the whole pizza but only eating part of it.)

This trend would be exacerbated if rUK is sitting to the South, enjoying bigger and bigger pizzas.

We've strengthened our depth and added quality, Looking at Javi Manquillo i'd have taken him over an older micah richards who hasn't played in got knows how long, Emre Can far younger than alex song, and why would we go and buy someone on his last legs when we could grow and mould our own players? The players we've brought in have a tonne of potential, even Lallana isn't that old, in the grand scheme of things.

Away to city is a fixture that it would be nice to win or get something out of, We Lost that fixture last season, and we also lost to southampton at home. We're technically 3 points up on last year given the same fixtures, if you want to be pedantic about dropping points.

And also, did you watch us on Sunday? Saying we got rammed by city is all well and good, but lots of teams get ""rammed"" against city, especially away and i think we were a little bit unlucky with the odd mistake, we had a fair amount of the game and set up very positively for the fixture.

Don't forget it was the second game of the season either.

And about us ""Doing a spurs"". It's a common trope that people blurt out when they want a soundbite. they went through two managers last year, the guy who brought in all the players, and subsequently an idiot. There is a system set up and in place specifically to develop younger player and you've seen it since rodgers came in. so signings like Markovic, Can, Moreno, Balotelli, Manquillo etc all make a lot of sense. 

The core of our squad is very much the same as it was, the most radical change has been at the back, with the center backs changing a little too much for comfort, but Sakho is in his second season, Skrtel is still there, Kolo is still there, the core is still strong.

The problem is that you can only go so far with a purely mathematical analysis.  My personal guess is that if the Conservatives were in power in 1974 we would have had a swing to the Left (what we had in voting terms **not** governmental terms when Blair was elected) earlier.  I think the Labour party winning in 1974 probably delayed this significantly since they were associated with (among other things) the winter of discontent.

Bit of a change recently. ""No"" got a boost after the first tv debate, but that's been falling away sharply, back to ""normal"" for the second tv debate (which most would agree Salmond won) and then the momentum all seems to be going to yes. Better Together have misjudged their final adverts, I would contend. They've tried to appeal to female voters since they're more risk averse and more likely to be No/Undecided, but they've come across as patronising. I think that's helping the momentum towards yes you see there. 

Just one (biased?) caveat on polling though. These organisations are built to predict elections - when it comes to referendum, they're much less accurate. In 1997 they were predicting the 2nd question to not have a majority, and yet it romped home with something like 68% of the vote - contrary even to the exit polling. 

Referenda aren't elections, and traditional methods can't automatically be applied, so take them with a pinch of salt. Today is the last day for registering to vote, and there is genuinely a queue out of the door for people wanting to make sure their voice is heard. Traditionally polling methods don't count these people.

I struggle to believe that a player who always behaved in such a friendly manner, hugging his teammates on the pitch for example, and had such a good rapport with the staff at the club that the official website made an article about his baby being born, could have been a genuine disruptive influence.

However, Warnock started blaming Luciano for Leeds' poor performances and results (I also think that he didn't like the way Becchio put little effort into training - Andy Lonergan said he was the worst trainer he'd ever seen - but when he scores that many goals it doesn't matter), and clearly wanted him out so that he could bring a worse player like Morison in.

I'd really recommend you look into it.

If I recall correctly, I think you may not be able to study English for free because you have already achieved a higher grade than a GCSE, but you should be able to get a fully funded maths qualification. Ask at your local college, they can be really helpful. And they're enrolling this week, so if you're really keen you could get started right away!

I also live in the north west and after a lengthy search (I have a degree, so education isn't always the magic key) I have managed to get a temp job through an agency, which I hope will lead to more work in future. Don't rely on universal jobmatch, it's pretty awful! Try Indeed.co.uk as a starting point and sign up to a load of agencies.

Just as a side note, don't dismiss your passion for photography as being an unreasonable career aspiration. I admit it's pricey to buy all the kit, but if you play it right you can make good money at weddings and events and by holding training courses for novices. If you make money from what may be seen as the more boring aspects of photography, you still have all the equpiment you need to have fun and create art in your free time!

Finally, someone in the comments rudely said not to overestimate yourself. I have to say the opposite, being bullied often causes people to underestimate their own worth.

Well the problem is that this is dependent on the individual doctor and to a large extent the NHS Trust.

If they decide X treatment is no good or expensive and so don't approve it but another hospital in another country believes that it is a viable treatment then the parents are left in the middle and unfortunately the law is against them at that stage.

I agree but there is a grey area in the middle where the parents should have more say. Obviously if you've got a dodgy appendix it needs to come out. But when it comes to long term cancer treatment it's more complicated.

Costa has started amazingly well, I suppose they might not need quite as much striking options given that they only ever play one up front, but they better hope he stays fit.

Arsenal have Sanchez, but with Giroud out for months, that only leaves ""Welbz"" and Sanogoals as backup. Welbeck is interesting: he's very quick and pretty skilfull, but he does seem to be fundamentally just not very good at scoring goals.

Certainly he's never been prolific, although Wenger likes a challenge.

For us, we have goal threat from Sterling, Sturridge, Balotelli, Lallana and Markovic (I hope). We should be fine

You're the one spreading the hate, not me.

&gt;I don't care about Torres' private life or relationships, all I care about is how he affected Chelsea Football Club and how he played and acted for us. I dislike him for no other reason.

Do you think people don't realize that Torres was a flop signing? You dislike him because we paid a bucket load of money for him, which was OUR decision, not his? I mean, do you possess any ounce of common sense at all? Shevchenko was another flop signing. Do you ""dislike"" him too? Your arguments are completely fallace and I am convinced more than ever that you weren't a supporter before 2010 at the very most. Hell, I'd even venture a guess that you started supporting this club the same time we signed Torres!

People like you were in here saying ""fuck Torres"" when the story of him convincing MVG to join Milan came out, even though that was exactly what the club wanted MVG to do. That's how ridiculous this anti-Torres brigade has become. And even after he's left you still feel the need to create a thread like this is? There is nothing wrong with appreciating a player who played a part in our success in winning the CL and Europa Cup. Sore winners are the worst, and says a lot about the type of person you are. For once, show some class for God sake.

true,DominoMotherfucker,devon,"Devon, but actually Bristol","I'm not really in favour of independence, however, as someone who has spent a lot of time working in retail there's one particular kind of customer I hate- the 'it's legal tender!' guy.

That smarmy asshole who hands over the Scottish bank note with a shiteating grin on his face. He sees it in your eyes, he knows that you don't want to take this alien bank note from him but no. Before you even start to reach for the cash he puffs himself up 'it's legal tender mate, you have to accept it!'

Of course, [it is legal tender,^^^see ^^^below](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2f8lm6/as_an_englishman_living_in_london_how_would/ck73io1) it makes no difference if Scottish or British notes are in the safe because the bank will honour them both. But the sense of shame when you get handed a strange note, with strange faces on it and you know you've lost another battle that you didn't know you were fighting...

Now, imagine a world with an independent Scotland. The man brings his shopping to the counter and you ring it through, he's sweating, trembling. He knows what lurks within his wallet. You look him in the eye defiantly and tell him the total- willing him, *daring him* to present the Scottish banknote. He opens his wallet, hands shaking in earnest now as he looks at you almost pleading and you begin to smile.

He hands over the banknote and you begin openly sneering with malevolent glee. ""Sorry Sir, that isn't legal tender we *can't possibly* accept that here."" 

The Scottish man starts to convulse, black smoke starts pouring from every orifice and he disintegrates like Josh Hartnett at the end of 30 Days of Night.

The thing is that they have other priorities, and I don't reasonably think they are going to provide someone for two or three whole days.

Regarding Article 8 part 2, I found this:

&gt; In Accordance with the/Prescribed by law

&gt;This means three things:

&gt;1. There must be a specific legal rule or regime which authorises the interference;
&gt;2. The citizen must have adequate access to the law in question (The Sunday Times v United Kingdom (1979) 2 EHRR 245);
&gt;3. The law must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to foresee the circumstances in which the law would or might be applied (Malone v United Kingdom (1984)7 EHRR 14).

I couldn't find anything in the bail act, or PACE, that specifically ""authorises the interference"" and is ""formulated with sufficient precision"". I know this is getting into the nitty gritty interpretation here, but is that worth anything?",0,1409658961,null,0,false,0,ck708ye,t3_2f8xh1,t1_ck708ye,t1_ck6zu6q,null,1427243055,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1

Given the way party whipping works it has only really been possible for this to happen to support Labour.  *(For the last two decades, at least.)*  The Conservatives only have one MP.

It might be nice to think that your local MP would vote in the best interests of the people who elected him (or her), but it tends to be that representing the electorate comes a distant third to personal interest and the interests of their party.  Not in cases, but in nearly all cases.
 
&gt;Although with that mind, the question ""when there was a change of government, was this measure not repealed?"" is an odd one - ask all the people who voted Liberal Democrat!

There was plainly no appetite for removing or reducing tuition fees among the Conservative party.

###Info 

Both of these shirts costa me a total of £8. I didn't have to buy the shirts separately and the printer had these generic white/black ones to print on.

I just gave a USB with the designs in the album in the link above and he told me to come back after 24 hours. I did and the shirts were done.

The white shirt has the design printed directly onto the shirt like hi-quality brand shirts are printed. If you move your fingers on top of it you can't feel it being different from the shirt. This will last much longer and can be tossed in the laundry like usual.

The black shirt has the design ironed on. It is exactly like the ""samsung"" , player names and letters are printed onto football jerseys. It requires the same level of care and usually hand washing and careful ironing is required. 

The guy I got these printed from had a very small shop and he told me in advance he didn't have the equipment to print the black one like the white one however I could see that it was the premiership ironing trick (like how they put your name on the back of the shirt in the megastore) and didn't find this to be a problem so ordered both. The white shirt is very silky and nice and the black shirt is a little bit heavier, I'm happy with both as I wear both types.

All and all very cheap. Just go to your local printer with a PNG and they will print these dirt cheap. Run a google search and you will be surprised how many there are in your area.",0,1409660930,null,0,1409661166,0,ck70qr9,t3_2f94c6,t1_ck70qr9,t3_2f94c6,null,1427242824,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"To get passed the back and forth caused by the other guy's snarkiness, I will explain what he's actually trying to say.

Tuition fees were originally introduced as a flat rate fee in 1998 under Blair's Labour government (at the recommendation of a report produced by Major's Conservative government).

In 2003/04, the Labour government decided to replace the flat rate to a system where universities could charge what they want up to £3000. Although due to whipping it should have been passed with a massive majority (since Labour had a massive majority of the seats), it only passed on a slight majority due to a Labour backbench rebellion (and the point originally made for the purposes of this thread is that it was pretty much the Scottish MPs that were the deciding vote).  Now the point to note is that the majority of Conservatives voted against this bill at the time.

In other words, the Conservatives were against the introduction of measures that allowed the universities to set their own fees. In fact, up until 2006, one of the Conservatives party's promises was to scrap all tuition fees. Sadly, in 2006 they announced a u-turn on this policy.

Now we move to 2010.  There were talks of possibly raising the fee cap even under Brown's Labour government with very vocal opposition from various unions.  This is what led to Nick Clegg's pledge (that still haunts him) to oppose all tuition fee increases. Then the coalition government were elected in 2010, and they raised the cap on fees.

So the other guy's point is, given both the Lib Dems and Conservatives have previous been on record as stating their opposition to tuition fees (or at the very least opposed to their increase) - so why, given tuition fee raises were incredibly unpopular to the public, did they raise the cap?

(That said, the point is meaningless since the Conservatives did make an official policy change and they have never been known to not do things just because the public don't like it...)",0,1409661197,null,0,false,0,ck70tec,t3_2f8lm6,t1_ck70tec,t1_ck6znhd,null,1427242790,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;If we had a Tory majority this government, then we would have left the EHCR already, we wouldn't have seen the income tax threshold increased to 10k, we would have seen the top tax rate abolished, and probably some more stuff.

I'm not convinced.

**Leaving the EU**:  I'm one of those people who thinks leaving the EU is probably financial suicide.  Staying in the EU is good for the Conservatives, because it gives them something to bitch about rather than either act, or to admit they're powerless to act.    
*I'm guessing you meant the EU in the broadest sense.  I looked up EHCR, since it was an initialism I didn't know and that's the Equality and Human Rights Commission,  We can't (so far as I understand it) do away with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) without leaving Europe.*

**£10,000 Income Tax threshold**:  Probably true.  Although I feel like we're pushing the working class in this country pretty close to boiling point and throwing a bone to workers makes some sense.

**Top rate of tax**:  Unlikely.  Firstly, they reduced the top rate from 50% to 45%.  Secondly, it would be political suicide.  Thirdly, due to tax avoidance it doesn't really raise all that much money.

**More stuff**:  I'd guess the obvious one here is the privatisation of the NHS.  The thing is, the NHS is sacrosanct to the majority of voters.  Outright selling off the NHS would be the move of someone who wanted to wipe out their party for two or three electoral cycles.  Better (in practical terms) to keep gnawing at the edges and that's what we're seeing happen anyway.  The other is to keep kicking the poor, the unemployed and the disabled.  But again, we're giving that as much of a go as you can without provoking riots.  There's only so far you can go with telling people, ""I'm kicking him because they're all lazy, feckless scum!  Haven't you seen Benefits Street?""

I think the Doctor has moved past blaming himself for deaths that came about as the result of other people's choices. He just helps where he can.

I think ""I don't have a plan at the moment"" is different from ""we're all doomed,"" and even that ""I'm sure I'll come up with something"" is possibly more hopeful and less dark than lying to spare someone from the fact that you have no idea what you're doing.",0,1409661677,null,0,false,0,ck70y8z,t3_2f6avh,t1_ck70y8z,t1_ck70oew,null,1427242728,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Look at the players in that category, they're all players who were bought cheap and have improved massively. Sterling, Ramsey, Courtois, Hart. They all had big potential, but weren't worth too much at the time. 

Whereas the other category, ""bargains"", is for players who were already top class, and were bought for a lot less than they were worth.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Re: Lamela. Thing is, against West Ham we went down to ten men early so it's not the best game to judge - same with Eriksen. Poch even mouthed ''4-4-1'', so both out of position of sorts. First game of the season too, and a derby (Wham) HATE us, so it's a different kind of game. I'm not gonna judge Erik on that, and it was his FIRST start in some ridiculous period of time. He still looked hungry though, a theme that I'm seeing in him now - he seems to really have HEART. Most ''cocky, confident'' type AML's aren't like that. He never gives up a lost ball, and in the first game I saw that alot.

QPR was the only game *we* did well, so naturally Erik did too. This was so one sided I can't even really judge him. My only critisim is he missed the easy option at times, but that comes with settling down (not trying to set the world on fire and prove a point every touch) - but he was good. 

Pool, everyone sucked. Same way everyone performed at QPR, Liverpool was the opposite. And again, the theme of him being hungry showed in the Pool game, even when it looked a lost cause out of everyone he looked the most determined. I think he'll pick up some goals.

Soldado is an engima. On paper, he's a fucking incredible player. His finishing is amazing, and he's a goal every 2 games player through his entire career. We just need to crack that code. I don't think it's some EPL is this drastically different league and he can't settle, he did it in Europa and hell - it's one professional vs another.

true,superhypernovae,null,null,"Hey buddy. 

I went to Liverpool school of art. Graduated 5 years ago. Being a designer at a large branding agency is just about the best thing I've experienced in my working life. Smaller boutique agencies can be great it the work is too notch, the people and the culture is good. Being freelance running your own projects for people is hard and takes it out of you. Working for one of these 100000s of web/graphic/print all in 1 that charge that have clients who don't understand the value of design... Well it'll make most people hate their job. 


I think if you want the best design education you should be looking at Preston some of the best designers I've worked with came from there. They have great connections with the industry and send you out for a year on internships ( which I think makes all the difference ) it's a good balance between the ideas and art of design. While keeping you very close to real design practices and ways of working. 

Liverpool school of art was great, on hindsight it felt a lot more like art and ideas ( which is very important ) but going into a design studio as an intern you can sometimes get lost when you don't quite understand their way of producing ideas and concepts. 

Presentation is important and it's a skill they don't push enough at LSoA. Being able to make ideas sell is something in still learning. Convincing your peers and clients is a damn important part. 

I think if you want to come out good at the end of uni, you need to ensure you aim for the top, compare yourself to the top top agencies. Never benchmark yourself with your fellow students or local design firms who make brochures and business cards. Don't get hung up on ascetics. Learn to present your ideas like your telling a story to someone who doesn't understand design.

My assumption would be that overall sex crimes statistics don't vary hugely between ethnic groups, but that specific types of sex crimes are more common in some groups than others. I'd guess whites make up a lot of the 'lone attackers', whereas Asians trend more towards the Rotherham type.

EDIT - found something: https://fullfact.org/factchecks/race_and_sex_offences-27153

It seems that the ethnic profile for white and asian male sex offenders is roughly proportionate to their % of the population, the outlier is black men, who make up about twice their proportion in the general population. However, when it comes to 'street grooming', asian men do make up a disproportionately high % of cases (around 1/4 of offenders (where 1/3 have ethnicity down as 'unknown' - so 1/3 to 1/2 of those where the ethnicity is known.)

true,kde01,king,,"&gt; I think the fact we got clear second choice targets can't help but dampen the mood. 

Clear second choice targets? How would you know that unless you're one of Pochettino/Levy/Baldini? 

&gt; Mainly Musacchio more than anything. We as fans more or less got a full look into the transfer and it was shambolic. Semantics and the need to overanalyse transfer sagas, it was pretty basic. We bid 17m for the player, Villareal wanted 17m for themselves so we needed to add the difference. Once we didn't do that, all ""we aren't supporting the manager"" felt justified cause we didn't in that instance.

We aren't supporting the manager because we refuse to spend far far over the odds for a CB? I don't even know if Musacchio was worth the 17M euro quoted, really. Fazio for 6M seems fantastic business. We don't even know if he was our main CB focus or if we were just inquiring about options and making a bid here and there. And we most definitely don't know if Pochettino explicitly said 'If you don't buy Musacchio you're not supporting me as the manager' so I'm not sure where you came to the conclusion that we're not supporting him....

&gt; 
&gt; Transfers aren't just about plugging holes. Transfers window are a way to give fans and players belief, which is what this team needs more than anything 

No, that's not what it is for. It's for getting players and support where it's needed. Buying players for fan confidence is silly - that just leads you to make the wrong choices. I'm incredibly glad this club doesn't listen to fans on who to buy. That's why Baldini exists, and he's much better at it than anyone here on this board (or any other I would bet). His job is to identify talent and price them out. He has a team behind him to help him and he has great connections across the business. While we're just assholes sitting here hammering away at keyboards.

&gt; We didn't do that at all, so I can't see how this window is a success. If the board doesn't really feel they need to have accountability, why should the player? 

...what? This is coming off as a bit drama queen-ish my friend. Sorry if I'm misinterpreting. The board has done absolutely nothing wrong. Their job is the long term success of the club and with the buys made this summer they've really showed us that they're serious about their focus. You don't show you're serious about long term growth by signing Di Maria for the GDP of several small countries and by getting Falcao on loan for one Rolls Royce per week. You show you're serious about long term grown by signing younger players who have a lot of potential to grow into a solid first team starter under the wing of a young manager who has proven he deserves a shot at the big time. 

&gt; You got us second choice players so we'll get you the second choice compettion. The players have no reason to feel the need to push themselves so I don't expect them too and I won't blame them if they don't. 

This is even more dramatic than the above. Second choice players? Again, how do you know they were second choice - are you Levy/Pochettino/Baldini?

How do you know the players have no reason to push themselves? They're getting paid every week and many of them really love the club. I'd say that's more than enough to play for. Watch United this year and see how much they feel big signing are worth paying for, LOL. 'Falcao and Di Maria are here - now I'm going to play better' - said no one, ever. Superstars help notoriety, sure, but a superstar isn't always the answer. Had United strengthened their defense more they'd be in a stronger position going into the season but at this point it seems like they're just trying to outscore their opponents, offense be damned. And that's what happens with your 'first choice signings' that we didn't make. You pay over the odds and can't plug other holes that need to be filled.

Truth be told, London needs the airports more than other cities do. Much as I'd like a Boris Bike scheme and better buses in my tiny town, I can't really get too angry about London buying a shiny new airport.

Considering the Boris Island idea though, it would make more sense to me to build one in an empty bit of land *north* of London rather than in the Thames, the far side of it from the rest of the country. I'm sure there's an empty space big enough somewhere, and if people are going to have to get a train to and from London anyway I don't see why it matters exactly where it goes, as long as it's the same sort of distance.

true,jpef,null,null,"For me it's all about this blind love Chelsea fans have always had for Torres. In many ways, I admit, it is a positive thing. We still gave full support to the man even through his darkest hours. Chants of ""Torres, Torres"" would consistently ring around the Bridge. This support we should be proud of.

However, whilst rightly giving him support, a large proportion of Chelsea fans have also built up this false image of Torres as this 'classy, loyal and positive' character in the club. Everyone seems to have forgotten the fact that the guy threatened to leave after the Champions League Final in Munich. The greatest day in our history and the [guy ""slams Chelsea"" for not starting him](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fernando-torres-slams-chelsea-and-hints-841821). 

Looking at the wider picture, no one is really acknowledging the extent of the disaster that was Fernando Torres. It all started in May 2006 when Chelsea were looking for a new striker. Mourinho wanted Fernando Torres, a young striker at Atletico Madrid who looked to be Europe's hottest new talent. Abramovich overruled him; instead going for Andry Shevchenko, who turned out to be pretty shit and opened the first crack in the relationship between manager and owner that would ultimately see Jose Mourinho, who had brought unprecedented success to the club, leave Chelsea in 2007. 

In 2011, Abramovich became fixated on capturing Torres, desperate to buy the man he had ridiculously missed out in favour of Shevchenko in 2006. This fixation/ obsession led to a £50million purchase on transfer deadline day. Chelsea were now stuck with a past-it striker, effectively ruined by his 2010 World Cup injury, with huge wages. From Jan 2011 to this summer, Chelsea have had no choice but to persist with Torres. The financial cost of bringing him in effectively made the decision irreversible. He had to improve, he had to score. 

As Chelsea persisted with him they missed out on top-class striker after top-class striker. In summer 2011, AVB was intent on buying Falcao from Porto. The money Chelsea had spent on Torres rendered this move impossible. Falcao then moved to Atletico and became arguably the best striker in world football. It was a similar situation with Cavani in summer 2013. The money we'd spent on Torres meant we had no choice but to stick with him.

Not only did Torres negatively effect who we bought but he also effected what we already had. Given the amount of cash we'd spent on him, he simply had to start. Sturridge never got a look in and was sold to Liverpool where he has since flourished. Lukaku was also a victim of the persistence with Torres. We'll have to wait to see how good he turns out. 

I want to stress that, apart from the second paragraph, none of this was personally the fault of Torres. It wasn't his fault we spent £50 million on him. Bless him, he certainly put in effort for the team, you can't question that. Nonetheless, buying Torres was the greatest 'footballing' mistake in the history of Chelsea. He should never have been a Chelsea player. 

So when I see fellow Chelsea fans milking this shitty, clearly fake 'letter' where he 'supposedly' describes himself as ""always a blue"" I just get so fucking infuriated.

&gt;__Betting arbitrage__, __miraclebets__, __surebets__, __sports arbitraging__ is a particular case of [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) arising on betting markets due to either [bookmakers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker) different opinions on event outcomes or plain errors. When conditions allow, by placing one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome. In the bettors' slang an arbitrage is often referred to as an __arb__; people who use arbitrage are called __arbers__. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

Lambert (4m)

Lallana (25m)

Markovic (20m)

Origi (10m)

Balotelli (16m)

As you can see, I'm going after a lot of value with Can and Lambert, with key buys in the defense with Lovren and Moreno.

I didn't include Manquillo because a loan deal is about wages, and we're not really discussing those.

I think Lallana and Markovic are good buys, but expensive without the Suarez money, and we can use our money more wisely elsewhere.

Balotelli and Origi are last because we don't need the striker depth. Origi above Balotelli only because it doesn't cause issues with strikers not getting enough game time (assuming his current loan deal is unchanged).

If I had a strict 60m, it would be Lovren, Can, Moreno, Markovic, and I'd be trying to convince the board that an extra 4m for Lambert is worth it.

Iago Falque - Decent fee, was never going to be a 1st team player. 

Gylfi Sigurdsson: Quality player but never looked like he would show his best on a regular basis, great fee for him. 

Michael Dawson: Loyal player but probably a bit off the pace now, ignoring sentiment, it was a good sale. 

Sandro: Tough one to take, I can only assume he has not fully recovered from his injury otherwise it's a really poor piece of business. 

Zeki Fryers: Was never a huge fan, happy for him to be on his way. 

Holtby (Loan): Looks like we'll never see Holtby in a spurs shirt which is a real shame, perfect AM back up, great eye for a through ball, tireless worker and always willing to put a foot in. Possibly my biggest disappointment, only one of him and Siggy had to go. 



Incomings:

Ben Davies: Seems like a good solid signing, good competition for Rose. Top 4 quality? Time will tell. 

Michel Vorm: Good quality back up keeper at a reasonable cost, good piece of business. 

Eric Dier: Looks to be a great signing so far and at a great price. 

Federico Fazio: Another CB was needed, will Fazio be the right man, no idea. Nice to have a bit more height in the team though.

DeAndre Yedlin: Looks like he has potential and good signing for commercial reasons. 

Benjamin Stambouli: Again, No idea whatsoever. 

Overall: Reasonably happy, the starting 11 hasn't really improved at all which is a little shame but we've kept our great depth and held on to all our key players. The depth in defence in particular looks very promising.

Could've done with getting rid of Ekotto and I would've been tempted to sell another midfielder instead rather than get rid of Holtby but I'm happy to Poch to build his team and see what happens.

This time of year is Tegenariae mating season so there are males everywhere.

Most, if not all of the UK spiders are also docile - they will not bite unless manhandled. The only risk of serious harm from UK spider bites is from secondary infection which is something that can happen to any bite, cut or graze.

So i was right then... oh.

&gt; The real meat has being the fights over the CAP and the UKs rebate 

The UK rebate is an exceptionally strong bargaining tool. Not only is it **always protected by a veto** (which is why the alleged French attack was overblown), it’s also the only permanent correction mechanism around. In case EU leaders can’t agree on a new long-term budget, the previous year’s is rolled over (plus 2 per cent to account for inflation). Britain keeps its rebate, whereas other net contributors may have to renegotiate theirs.

Second, the more cash that goes to the new member states, the less the UK rebate will be worth. It so happens that the new long-term EU budget deal will see proportionally more cash to central and eastern Europe (rightly in my view), meaning the rebate will drop. This means that though the EU budget is cut, the UK’s net contribution is likely to go up.

Third, the consequence of the above is that in a no deal, rollover scenario, the new distribution wouldn’t materialise.**Therefore, in net terms the UK would actually be a winner – again, meaning the UK was more relaxed about a “no deal” scenario in these talks than most other EU countries.**

&gt; most recently the opt out of the 'fiscal compact.

Which we got to opt out of, we didnt need an alliance for that.

&gt; We might have being 'closer to Europe' had we not being awkward over these issues but the EU at the highest level is essentially a giant horse-trading operation where you have to fight your corner or get fucked over by the two biggest members who are in permanent cahoots with each other.

Wait a minute, two countries with similar ideologies are working together, THOSE BASTARDS!

Yes because we are arguing about Hadith.

Sourced links in which you didn't provide for yourself. I wanted to understand you not the website. It looks like you just visit these websites to re-inforce your hatred.

&gt;Yes. And that's what I found.

Then give me the verses that you opened from the book and posted here theur numbers instead of going to these sites.

&gt;I got that impression from actually reading the Quran. 

Yeah sure, and that impression was re-inforced by reading Islamophobic websites. You seriously opened the Quran in an open-mind and unbiased filtered mind???????? Or you hated from the beginning and looking for excuses to hate on it  with the credibility of you reading the Quran.


&gt;OK, so what's the next line of criticism? That I may have read it, but I obviously didn't understand it and need to start going to lessons to learn how to read it properly? 

There is no line yet!!! Because you have shown no evidence of you reading the Quran in an open mind. If you really did you would open the book and highlights what you YOU as a person of rational mind tink is wrong with the Quran and debate freely using your own opinions. But instead you re-direct me to a website filled with hate.


&gt;Or is it going to be that I only read a translation in English. Maybe I should have spent five years learning ancient arabic first.

Poke fun at what you want it re-inforces my opinion about you.

Secondly the Quran is written in Classical Arabic not Ancient Arabic which has died out.

Specifically because the great intelligence entered his timeline and is thus must likely effecting him somehow. As opposed to an external affect i am expecting an internal affect.  This may be what is making him more careless with peoples lives. It is the great intelligence trying to destroy him internally or teach him something in terms of a neglected aspect of what he is.  This may be the reason for the attack eye brows, the message he is trying to tell himself, to be very cynical of the world and himself because it is not obvious what is real and what is implicated by the great intelligence.  This his message has to be encrypted internally.

I think there is a good bet that the great intelligence and Clara are still highly inter related in terms of plot since the trensalor episode seemed more like a beginning than an ending or explanation for Clara. What did i miss?

I suspect that Missy(is that what she is called?) heaven/promised land is somehow related to the great intelligence although its not clear how yet.

true,Doomslicer,eng-norfolk,Norwich,"&gt; If we shorten down the time frame to Malthus onwards they've been demonstrably wrong.


Malthusian catastrophe has not occurred due to a series of dramatic innovations that Malthus could not possibly have predicted. How could he have anticipated mechanised agriculture when he died just two years after the invention of Stephenson's Rocket? Or should an academic in economics and demography have predicted that we'd be using the Haber process (proposed in 1905) to create nitrogen fertilizers from hydrocarbons?


And the idea of the 'demographic transition' - birth rates falling in a population as access to healthcare, sanitation, contraception and education increases - didn't pop up until 1929. Britain's demographic transition is thought to have occurred from 1750 and 1975. Malthus having died in 1834, would only have seen the first 84 years of a 225 year process (about the first third, where birth rates rocket and death rates plummet).


So Malthus *is* wrong, because he didn't anticipate massive unforeseeable increases in our ability to produce food, or that industrialisation would so completely alter a facet of human behaviour. That does not mean overpopulation cannot happen, or that tech always outpaces population growth.


With the facts he had available and the conditions of society at the time, his theory was probably correct.


Although it is not a classic Malthusian problem, a very real concern for us is the overlap between an impending energy transition, climate change, and peak population.


Global population is expected to hit ~9.5 billion around 2050. The large scale transition, willing or no, from fossil fuels is likely to happen in the interim. Globally, many large agricultural producers are using water faster than it can be sourced, and increasing industry and rising standards of living of people lifted out of poverty increases demand further. We likely cannot elevate the current 7 billion to a western standard of living. We likely cannot even sustain the current global standard as it is.


The question is shifted from 'Will human population stop growing without famine?' To 'Can we support peak human population without catastrophe until it declines of its own accord?'


A billion people are malnourished, another billion are nutrient deficient. Two billion (probably the same two) don't have access to clean water. This is not a situation into which one wants to introduce another 2.5 billion people - but that's what's anticipated.


And, yes, we can hope that we get Malthus'd, and that huge yield-improving innovations are just around the corner. But the low hanging fruit (so to speak) has already been picked.",0,1409669788,null,0,false,0,ck73vg9,t3_2f8uqf,t1_ck73vg9,t1_ck6zxwl,null,1427241363,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,barejokez,null,null,"ok, theoretical stuff first: shares are a ""share"" in a company. google have 388 million shares out there, so each share is worth 0.0000000026% of google (or something, i didn't do the maths there).  if you buy one share in google, then you are entitled to that percentage of the company, and in theory that percentage of their profit, assets, etc (after debtholders and the taxman have been paid).  in reality, google will keep some of their profits as cash to invest in new projects, and pay the remainder to shareholders as dividends.  so once or twice a year, they send you a virtual cheque for a few pence.

you can buy or sell that share at any time, and depending on how keen the world is on google shares at the time, the price might be high or low.  so you make money by buying low, selling high, and collecting the dividend cheques. generally people look for companies that pay high dividends, or have a good business case that suggests earnings will grow.  Or they look at share price graphs and look for patterns (that might be unrelated to the actual performance of the business).  this is the ""homework"" bit - it isn't enough to say ""google are a good company"", you have to have an opinion about whether they will continue to get better, and know whether the share price is currently high or low vs your opinion of the company.

the main issue that people have with shares is that they come with a lot of specific risk. for example, if you invested in RBS heavily about 8 years ago, you'd have lost a lot of money as the share price dropped heavily.  if you invest a lot of your money in one company, you have this risk (even though you might be confident, it still exists, even for google and similars).  

the fund concept attempts to minimise this risk, while also doing the homework for you.  a person/group of people will be working full time to assess companies and pick stocks that they think are cheap. They gather up money from people like ourselves (and also pension funds/insurance companies/other entities with a lot of cash), and they invest it across a range of companies.  it means that even if RBS does crash, you are invested in 99 other companies and the effect is less than it would be if you only have time to analyse one company. they also charge a fee for beign the manager (c. 1-2% of the fund value per year), but as they are trying to earn you 10-15% per year, that isn't normally a huge issue for investors. 

the big issue with funds is you basically have to trust the manager completely (and accept the loss if they get it wrong). you still have to do a bit of homework (looking at track record, and seeing if their investment philosophy makes sense to you), but it is a much easier way to invest than doing it all yourself.

as a final note, you can also get ""passive"" funds, which will simply track a major index such as the FTSE100 (the 100 biggest companies listed in London).  they charge much less than the active managers, but do less work as they don't take a view on the companies, just invest according to the list.  they still give the the risk diversification benefit.

You're right, it's not exactly relevant to the day to day life of more than a fairly small set of people, but I think it's important that people at least have a rough understanding of how computers and the internet function. I can imagine it being very easy for a child born today to grow up their entire life using computers and tablets that are extremely user friendly, and basically never having to go into settings or anything. ""I just click internet and type what I want and google brings it to me."" I don't think knowing how to build a webpage in HTML is very important, but I think it's important to know how a webpage comes to be.

It's the same as teaching history. You wouldn't be disadvantaged by never knowing WWII happened but learning about it allows you to understand why Britain (and the world) is the way it is today.

Secondly, be patient. There's no rush to invest. Just keep it as cash until you're comfortable in knowing what to do. 
To answer the question of what to do with it, consider building up your knowledge on the following:

Diversity and co variance -- spread the risk over different asset classes.

Momentum and trend following -- what's going up now is more likely to continue going up than to fall

Management costs of funds -- put simply, you can be fleeced when investing in funds with high charges. 

With that research you'll get some key concepts that you'll either believe or not. Then buy some funds that reflect your beliefs. Stick to low cost funds and ETFs and start the journey of learning about investment. 

Will you be successful? Who knows. But at least you'll be in control. Good luck.

Ignore the clauses asking you not to have any other student accounts. They can't find out, and they couldn't do much if they did find out. Pay off your current debt using the new (interest free). This gives you a 1yr reprieve while you figure out how to earn some money. Some banks let you keep the student discount after graduation, but wind down the limit every year.

Good things:

* The TARDIS doesn't shake anymore. I miss this, but it works well with this Doctor's persona. If the shaking distracted him in any way, he would get rid of it. And he did. The camera (thank God) isn't shaky, but it moves around in a way that benefits the new feel of the show, and isn't distracting.

* Kinda disappointed that I saw the opening title sequence years ago on YouTube, but that's ok, because I love it.

* AMAZING filming of the Daleks' attack on the rebels. I've grown so weary of the classic static camera showing Daleks lazily moving into position, killing someone every 10 seconds. On a related note...

    * The humans finally killed a Dalek with a footsoldier's weapon (not a bazooka). I'm so glad the ""rebels"" weren't waging war on the Daleks with G-36s.
    * Dalek rapid-fire. About time.

    * Terrifying Daleks. Also about time.

* Making a plot twist about a Dalek that is actually very interesting and doesn't seem contrived for the sake of a Dalek episode.

* One of the most serious Shrink-Ray stories ever made. :P

* Great potential in Danny Pink. I judged him when they announced him, and I was proven wrong (so far).

* Clara (kiiiiinda) got rid of the bangs. Please. Get rid of them. For us. For science.

---

Bad things/Nitpicks:

* Clara's bangs are still kinda noticeable. \*shudder\*

* Weird British too-specific computer voice commenting on the situation continues to have a hold on Doctor Who. At least it wasn't as bad as Bad Wolf...

* I hurt my head hitting the ceiling when I freaked out that we saw Missy again.

    So glad that we aren't subjected to seeing an arcing plot's introduction in the first episode, doing several halfway-decent independent episodes with little to no hints, then cramming the plot in the Christmas special. \*ahem\*

---

Possibly good things I'm super excited about and some may be huge mega-spoilers so I'll tag them appropriately:

* [I think that Missy is] (#s ""the Master""). Apparently the internet agrees with me. Feels good.

    There's many good explanations why they would do this:

    * [It became canon in the S6 episode ""The Doctor's Wife"" that] (#s ""a Time Lord can regenerate into the opposite sex."")

    * [By disambiguation:] (#s ""Missy = Mistress = Female Master."")

    * Also seen in the first episode with Jenny &amp; Vastra, Doctor Who is caving to the radical feminist pressure of the 72% of its fanbase, Tumblr. [But if the end result is] (#s ""The Master""), then I don't mind at all.

    * Because I want it to be so.

* [""Am I a good man, Clara?""] (#s ""Is this a hint at Valeyard things? If 12 *is* the Valeyard, his conflicts/resolutions with Clara, Danny, his enemies, and/or the Master will be fascinating to say the least. And judging by the episodes so far, it will be very well done. ""No. You are a good Dalek."""")

* The possibility of Danny Pink being a very human, flawed character that isn't ruined by bad acting and plot. The hope that Sam Anderson continues to act the crap out of his character.

    Seeing him interact with the Doctor.

* Fair-weather Tennant/Smith fans will slowly like this season. I hope you feel ashamed of complaining. I still won't subscribe to your Tumblr.",0,1409671289,null,0,false,0,ck74jnr,t3_2f113q,t1_ck74jnr,t3_2f113q,null,1427241049,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I moved to another address recently and instead of just movind the line/number they've given me a new contract for 12 months. there were no phone line in the flat at all, so they wired it fo free since i was already a customer. My initial contract was still active and i had BT infinity connection in previous house which was around 70 Mbit/s, now they can offer only up to 6Mbit/s. 6Mbits in 21st century! that's uber fail. I decided to change the provider but forced to pay early termination fee - 170£. Is this even legal for them to ask for lost future profit from their customers? if no service provided why should we pay for that? nonsense... I decided to find out any options how to trick that screwed company. I have registered all the slow bandwith meters which were lower than stated in agreement ( &lt; 2,5Mbit/s) spend few hours arguing first with technical support as their argument is ""we are checking your speed now and it is good - 3Mbit/s"" it's funny because it's not, then i was moved to the next level of support who just stand on it's own and telling me to pay the fee if i don't like the service. I can't prove anything as their bandwithmeter web site is not accessible when speed drops below 2 Mbit/s, so i just can't prove anything. My arguing continues for 2 months already. I have a thread somewhere that the only way to terminate agreement without paying the fee is when they are raising the prices for service and you have 7 days after notification. Found out that next raise will be in december. I hope this will be an escape...

There is more to do each year and coming from Canada there is nowhere else that she'll get as much fun and Scottishness from. Seawest, go to the street party, there are bands all along the street, it is a huge party and extremely friendly. People are dancing singing and when the countdown comes there is a hundred thousand people who will countdown with you and then explode into a frenzy of kissing and hugging. 

It's famous for a reason and it's sourpusses like IndividualNo6 who give Scots a bad name. Honestly, to say to someone who is coming halfway round the world that one of the most famous New Year Parties is rubbish is just ridiculous. 

You'll see Scottish music and dancing, you'll meet lovely people and there is a good chnace if you are friendly that you'll be invited back to any one of dozens of parties (obviously be careful who you go with). 

Afterwards there are lots of pubs nearby you can get a drink in or you can book tickets for dozens of club nights and dance until dawn. It's a huge and amazing event - http://www.edinburghshogmanay.org/. 

many even consider getting tickets for the concert in the gardens which goes on at the same time, Lilly Allen will be great, if you don;t know her then go listen to some stuff. 

Good palces to eat, oh man, Edinburgh is crammed. From the strange, like [The Dogs](http://www.thedogsonline.co.uk/) to the posh like [Rhubard](http://www.prestonfield.com/Dining-RhubarbRestaurant.html). There are new places which are amazing, recently I went to Mark Greenaways [new restaurant](http://markgreenaway.com/) and by god it was great. 

There are lots of good little places too like [Oink](http://www.oinkhogroast.co.uk/) for a Hog Roll (amazing if you've never tried one). Search around there is something at all levels and budgets and you'll be able to eat amazingly if you do a little research beforehand. 

Edinburgh has more to do than basically anywhere its size, the Castle, museums, parliament, old town - the Royal Yacht Britannia was recently voted one of the best attractions in Europe and that's not even somewhere I've been to myself yet. 

Come, enjoy and I say do the party, have an amazing night and as you're watching the fireworks explode above the castle and roll down the hillside in a wall of flame and colour you'll know you made the right choice.

I think [this article](http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/is-steven-moffat-a-feminist-writer-61206.htm) addresses it effectively, and this section in particular:

&gt;Steven Moffat loves writing female characters. That doesn’t have to be feminist on its own, but I still find it striking that of all the returning characters Moffat has come up with so far, only two (Rory and Strax) are men, while seven (River, Amy, Vastra, Jenny, Clara, Kate Stewart and Madame Kovarian) are women. Additionally, there rarely goes an episode by without an interesting female one-off character. And since one thing feminists are always hoping for in television is representation, we can tick that box already. 

&gt;Is it good representation? And my whole-hearted answer is yes. Although there are of course exceptions (Tasha Lem springs to mind), almost all of Moffat’s female characters are fully-rounded interesting characters with strengths and flaws. To name just a few, there is the heroic and tragic teenage mother Nancy, the smart and authentic Sally Sparrow (who became a big fan favourite after just one story), the kind and determined Madge Arwell or the distrustful and responsible Clara Oswald. All of them showed a great range of emotion and character.

Let me share my story as a visitor to london
;
I went to a crystal palace vs AVFC football match, using the overground i travelled from highbury to crystal palace on my pre loaded oyster card. 
On my return the train station was packed, not only with police but also rival supporters, luckily the atmosphere was calm but we were still ushered onto the train by police, most likely using crowd control tactics. I was pushed through a side entrance along with my family and had no option in which way to board the train (this will become relevant).
Upon finishing my journey, i was approached by a ticket inspector, he checked my families tickets and all was fine, then he came and checked myn.
He scanned my card and it beeped, he then looked at me and started to ask where i boarded. I was slightly confused as to why, but i cooperated as i knew i had enough fare on the oyster. He then proceeds to tell me that my oyster is invalid and im getting a fine. 
I questioned him as to why, and stated that my oyster had enough money on it. He refused to tell me and continued his rant about what my name and address was. This then became a heated exchange, i tried to keep cool but this bloke was an idiot. 
I explained i wasn't from London, which was clear as i was in my Aston Villa shirt and have a broad Birmingham accent, but he continued to state, your getting a fine because you didn't scan your card. My family got involved and we were all trying to explain how that wasn't possible due to crowd control but this bloke wasn't interested. He then started a conversation with my dad, about me as if i wasnt there.
I noticed the train was now fortunately pulling into my platform and i just left the train, in which he followed me along with three other and grabbed my arm. This further caused a heated exchange in which HE threatened to phone the police on me for intimidation and assault. When i told him id do it for him, he quickly backed down. My dad managed to calm the situation as i walked away and sat on a bench to compose myself. 
They had a conversation, what was said im unsure, but the bloke came over to me and said 'next time you use the london trains scan your oyster card, if there is crowd control just let the officer know that questions you.' This made my blood boil, he explained he wasnt going to ticket me because my farther was a good man and that he explained the situation, even though i already had!! He even had the cheek to then inform me i would be charged maximum fare due to not scanning my card and would need to get this refunded by the ticket attendant, by just explaining why i didnt 'scan in'.

So to sum it up, the ticket inspector delayed a overground train by 15minutes to argue about how i should always scan in, and then proceeds to tell me i would of been charged double the fare had he not intervened, like he was doing me a favour! Ive never dealt with anything like it before, it was almost bipolar. I literally was so dumbfounded i didnt know how to take the situation after it had happened.

Attracting players was not our problem. Scheniderlin wanted the move and I assume J-rod was the same. Had we moved early in the window Schneiderlin would probably be a Spurs player and J-Rod was always available. Even then, there were other high profile players that went to similarly sized clubs (or weaker). Lukaku for example.

I don't expect us to pick up 7 new players and create a new squad. I do expect 1-2 though. Our strongest 11 at the moment does not include a single new player. Maybe Fazio, but we haven't even seen him play yet. It's not wrong to suggest we could've fit in a new signing and I doubt Schneiderlin or J-rod would have had much trouble adapting at all. 

I get that we're saving for a new stadium, but if the difference between us making the champions league and not is a 20million signing, that puts us in a worse position. There is absolutely no reason we shouldn't be aiming for a top 4 finish this year. If we don't make it, that's not failure, we're a club that's building, but any season where we do not throw everything towards a top 4 finish is a season we choose to sit around and bide time.

It's such a fundamental element of the international legal system, and the rights of the accused- stripping it on a whim, without due process, sets a horrible precedent. Moreover- we can deal with the issue in other ways- it's not a necessary step.

PC parts devalue drastically like a car, especially since warranties are none transferable. The only benefit from buying this would be that it's pre-built which is offset by the lack of warranty and higher cost.

Edit: For anyone interested in building a PC you are more than welcome to PM me for any advice or help but there are subs out there to help including

- /r/buildapc
- /r/buildmeapc/

[You can also use websites like to help you get a good idea of what you require for a PC](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com). 

Furthermore PC building isn't hard and even a novice can follow tutorials on youtube to build one up from scratch. I fully recommend anyone considering a new PC actually look at this option because the skills and experience will be invaluable in the future if you, a friend or family member has a problem! Simply knowing how to put a CD/Hard drive in and out can save you some money. Adding ram is one of the easiest 'upgrades' you can do with a PC and it's usually as simple as clipping it into the spare slot when you have purchased the relevant ram stick.

2 good seasons under his belt and he could be north of 40 million.

But remember Suarez and Bale went for huge money because of the year-on-year improvement.

Suarez scored 30 goals two season in a row (second season they were all league goals). 17 goals the year before.

You could see how good he was.

Bale scored 11, 12 and then 26 goals in the 3 seasons. Was PFA player of the year twice and voted into the UEFA Team of the Year and he was young enough to get better from there.

Sterling would need a vast improvement to get near those two. But he's showing signs of developing into a top quality player. He's not in that league yet. Potential and performance are completely different.

Plenty of players with potential who stop developing and stagnate.

Rodgers' job is to keep him moving forward and develop his game.",0,1409675574,null,0,false,0,ck76kf9,t3_2f9hq5,t1_ck76kf9,t3_2f9hq5,null,1427239762,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

diversification is about limiting losses, and to figure out where you are on that, the best thing is to create a proper financial plan for your retirement (if you haven't already).  if you want to retire at 65, and you want an income of £25k pa after retirement, you need to have about £500k (very approx.) by that age.  if you can commit to putting £10k per year into a pension, then you need to achieve average annual returns on your investments of x%. all made up numbers, but you can hopefully see that you can kind of work backwards to see how much you need to save and how much breathing space you have.

the point is, you are probably in a situation where losing £1k could be a real problem, so only investing in 10 companies comes with risks (that you may never encounter, fingers crossed). other people might be lucky/forward thinking enough that they could lose £100k and just feel annoyed, rather than genuinely affecting their lifestyle. it all depends on what you're trying to achieve.

the fund is basically as you describe. the other benefit is that you can invest relatively small amounts into funds (if they are aimed at individual investors like you and i).  You might be able to make a fund investment as small as £500, whereas you can't physically buy 1 share of each FTSE100 companies yourself with that amount. it allows you to own a fraction of lots of shares, which means you can be more flexible.

The reporter notes that ""the horrors in Rotherham fit into a pattern. In other northern towns such as Oldham and Rochdale, as well as in southern cities such as Oxford, gangs of Asian men have been convicted of grooming and abusing young, mostly white girls."" 

The article states that ""ethnic misogyny then ran up against the institutional misogyny of the police and the mostly white council.""

Political correctness taken to an extreme was also a factor as ""several local councillors suggested opening up the issue of race could “damage community cohesion”. Staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators in light of recent bitter fights between whites and Pakistanis in other northern towns.

These are the obvious facts of the case. Brushing them off as an 'over simplification' is refusing to admit the obvious and a sign that someone is pushing an agenda of their own. People should always be judged as individuals but when a pattern of abuse emerges there are clearly larger factors involved.

true,kde01,king,,"&gt; You say it like it doesn't matter whether we make the champions league this year or in 3 years. There's obviously a huge difference, not only financially, but like you said, it brings us on par.

From a totally neutral perspective it most definitely matters. From our perspective as a club, though, I think it will come if we really get to playing well. If we don't get it this year I won't mind as long as we see obvious progress at the club and on the pitch.
 
&gt; Attracting players was not our problem. Scheniderlin wanted the move and I assume J-rod was the same. Had we moved early in the window Schneiderlin would probably be a Spurs player and J-Rod was always available. Even then, there were other high profile players that went to similarly sized clubs (or weaker). Lukaku for example.

Pochettino had just come after Southampton already sold their second player, IIRC. I'm sure everyone knew he liked Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez but Pochettino himself wanted to get a good, thorough look at the squad before having money get spent. And getting Schneiderlin or Jay Rodriguez wouldn't really improve the defense, which was the priority.
 
&gt; I don't expect us to pick up 7 new players and create a new squad. I do expect 1-2 though. Our strongest 11 at the moment does not include a single new player. Maybe Fazio, but we haven't even seen him play yet. It's not wrong to suggest we could've fit in a new signing and I doubt Schneiderlin or J-rod would have had much trouble adapting at all.

Schneiderlin would have slotted right in, Jay Rodriguez is still coming back from injury. Fazio is most likely a starter and I think the longer the season goes on the more starts we'll see for Davies and Stambouli. Stambouli could be just what we need in the middle to keep the ball moving forward while offering a lot in defense. We haven't see him play in lilywhite yet and until we do we can't say where and how he'll really fit.

 
&gt; I get that we're saving for a new stadium, but if the difference between us making the champions league and not is a 20million signing, that puts us in a worse position. There is absolutely no reason we shouldn't be aiming for a top 4 finish this year. If we don't make it, that's not failure, we're a club that's building, but any season where we do not throw everything towards a top 4 finish is a season we choose to sit around and bide time. A non-productive transfer window has the potential to ruin our chances before the season starts.

Getting Champion's League for one season isn't going to ensure anything. If we get into the groups and then drop out there, we are in Europa again. Getting into the groups of the CL gives you ~7M and each win just under 1M (from last years figures it seems - i expect it to go up but not by much). Since we don't have the best coefficient we're likely to draw two teams stronger than us. Let's say we win three matches and fall out of the CL, we're sitting at 10M. Hardly anything superb. If you win the CL you make (from the competition alone) 30M (acc to 2012 figures). If we're signing multiple 20M players during a summer and don't win the CL then what? What if we don't get top 4 again the next year? Nothing is guaranteed. 

We need to make sure our revenue stream (the new stadium) is guaranteed and kit and sponsorship deals are always in our favor. That is how you ensure a clubs financial stability. Shooting for top 4 every single year by dropping money on 20M players isn't. 

We're not one 20M player away from a top four place by any means. If we want to GUARANTEE top 4 we probably need to not only spend 100M+ only on attacking players but another 50M on midfielders AND ensure that everyone gets playing together very quickly. Even if it happened we'd have to win the whole CL for several seasons just to pay for those players (more if we aren't counting ticket sales and CL tv revenue).

Instead we can focus on building a self-sustaining club that won't fall apart financially if we miss out on the CL for a couple years. Build a state-of-the-art stadium with ~56k seats (third largest in the Prem) to increase our matchday revenue by the cost of 20k additional seats. Let's assume that just half of those go to season ticket holders and we're already talking about 18M for just league matches...",0,1409677273,null,0,false,0,ck77e3s,t3_2f7n8w,t1_ck77e3s,t1_ck75j3v,null,1427238999,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Nobody truly understands eye colour genetics, because there's a whole bunch of genes that determine it. But to give you a basic model, you have one part of the code that determines whether your eyes are brown or not brown, and another part of the code that determines (if your eyes are not brown) whether they're blue or green. The green gene developed in Anatolia, and today Turkey is the most green-eyed nation in the world.

You need to be honest with yourself about whether you need help.

However, the good news is, your creditors may be more sympathetic to your situation if they know all this. You clearly admit that you owe the money, the question is when and how you'll pay it back. Assuming you are actually going to get yourself some help for your mental health issues, you need to tell them that.

I imagine politicians will have a vote just to leave the EU but not the EEA (unless they have really lost it), if that happens it will become harder for Brits to work abroad and it would fuck up many of my plans for the future as i like going on working holidays around Europe.

If Scotland does join the EU though i could see people in Scotland been annoyed that they have even less say in there government than they had in the UK, particularly if they have to join the euro and so lose control of there monitory policy.

Watching a lengthy debate on europe last night it was interesting to repeatedly hear a phrase that will be familiar from the referendum debate ""you can't have a monetary union without political union"" except no one involved in the debate was from the UK and they were talking about the euro.

true,miomike,null,null,"I've spent the day pondering (solid, unrelenting, pondering) how I feel about the transfer window. And I have come to the conclusion that I feel.... 

OK.  

Just OK.  

(Wall of text inc.)  

I'd long since come to terms with the player sales etc, we'd had the best part of 2 months to get used to them having gone. So yes, annoyed about that from the start etc, but hey, been and gone. However, in terms of the players we brought in to replace those, most seem to be reasonable, but I don't feel like our business was done anywhere near quick enough. We got Pelle and Tadic in nice and quick and everyone started thinking it might all be alright, then sold two more players and suddenly not a single signing for far too long. So really I'm not happy it seemed to take us so long to get business done with signings when all of our players had gone before half our players were back from holiday. Good or not to get the players we did eventually, it took too long and I was not impressed with that.  

As for the signings:  

Pelle - looks OK so far, and has started scoring etc now so hopefully that'll continue. He'll have to seriously learn to throw his weight around better and hopefully his link up play will prove to be as good as Lambert's. Time will tell how good a signing he is, but can at least see the potential for him getting into double figures.   

Tadic - looks great, my only criticism of him as a signing is that in our first 3 games we looked far too reliant on him! He looks very good, comfortable on the ball, good passes, the works. Hopefully as the team gets to know each other and players get on the same wavelength etc, he'll be even better, up his assist and also goal scoring tally, and we'll be singing his praises more than we are already.  

Forster - is a great keeper, could well be with us for a good few years, very happy with him as a signing. I don't think there are many other keepers that would come to us that are better, if any.  

Bertrand - looks a good enough replacement for Shaw. Shaw would always be difficult replace because when we saw him we saw the amazing player he will one day be, as well as the great LB he already is, especially for his age. If he proves good enough then hopefully we can buy him for a reasonable price. He's no home-grown future star, but as a replacement signing he's a good player.  

Long.... Shane Long.... I just don't know. I feel like this was a massive panic buy of us wanting a striker before season started. I don't know he's really the level of player we needed, especially for the price. Even ignoring the price then I'd have liked someone maybe a bit younger, a bit more promise, or just someone with a better record for his experience. If he proves me wrong I'll be ecstatic. Double figure goals and/or double figure assists and I'll be happy. But looking around at other striker signings (Abel Hernandez for £10m, Welbeck for £16m) I feel like Long will be the one that takes the flack for a few things.  

Gardos - Not a clue about yet obviously, not seen him, and he's from a league where few people know much about it. We needed defenders, we got defenders, lets see how it works out.

Same applies to Toby too, although he's more of a known quantity, played in a big league for a big team and also internationally, I don't know much about him personally. Just that he's regarded very, very highly, and is regarded as quite the coup for us. Although on loan it's still a good deal, and if the reported £6/8m buy-out clause is right then a) great work getting that deal and b) I seriously hope we buy him if he comes good (which I both hope and think it will).  

Sadio Mane - Exactly the type of player we've lacked since Puncheon left. Also a very promising player to get overall anyway. Pacey as hell, quick feet. If he adapts well to the physicality of the league and can still use his pace then he could be a real danger, and help us unlock those defenses that come to St Marys and play for the draw, which is an increasing number of teams despite our ""exodus"".  

Some positions are much better now, Boruc back up to Forster, Toby/Gardos/Fonte/Yoshida is a strong defensive 4 to be able to pick from, Yoshida has looked quite good again since getting games, so I'm happy with him there. LB is much the same as last season, just the one main player, though Targett has looked good when he's played and I think is ready to play as a decent back up to Bertrand. RB we've lost depth, though both Toby and Cork can play there so we should be OK, but it's a shame to lose such a promising player in Chambers.  

Midfield is obviously our strongest. Not too sure on the Ramirez loan, but he's too inconsistent so hopefully getting a lot of time at Hull will mean that when he comes back he'll be the player we've all thought he could be. However we've got Schneiderlin/Wanyama/Cork who can play the holding role still, Ward-Prowse/Schneiderlin/Cork and Davis who can play the central role. The attacking midfielder role is where I think Ramirez was good for depth, if we play it as a creative midfielder then Tadic *could* play, but I feel he'll be on the wing more till Rodriguez is back, and so that leaves us more with Long in a behind-the-striker role, or JWP in a role that he's not really showed the flair for. Or Davis who can play OK there, but just don't let him near the box because as soon as he's in the box he turns into a Sunday league player.  

Forwards are still an area I'm not sure about. With Rodriguez back it'll look a bit better, but assuming Tadic/Mane are our wing players, then Long can cover one or t'other, and eventually Rodriguez, we've also then got Long as our striker cover... and perhaps Rodriguez. A few players covering a few positions in those attacking roles, but we'll see.  

Obviously time will tell. Maybe look back at this thread come Christmas and say I was wrong about some, or I was right about others, but for now I just feel like all we've done is replace those we lost more than we've added a great amount of strength in depth, if only because of the number of players that have left. Our team is only stronger in depth compared to last in the sense that Osvaldo was basically non-existent as depth, and there was no cover for Shaw. GK and CB are the only positions I feel we've truly strengthened, and we're basically at where we are all over with other positions. We needed ""3/4"" players last season to add depth, but we've just replaced the ridiculous number we lost. Plus getting Forster.

He is virtually a god and it seems like he's starting to look more and more at the big picture instead of mourning individual lives. But there is a lack of compassion accompanied by his attitude this around, and I think that's what myself and others are picking up on.

If you don't want to invest this way, you might be paying for something you're not using.

If you want active or passive fund management (i.e. collective investment, using a fund manager to run the fund for you), you can get this via a Stakeholder pension or a Personal Pension Plan, and the provider charges will be much less.

Both sides agree to a fee up front and at the end of the season the purchasing team decides if they want to buy the player or not--the selling team can't refuse because they already signed off on a fee.  If that's not the case and Tottenham could simply refuse to sell or raise the price, then what is the point of agreeing to a fee up front in the first place?  

Holtby would still have to agree to contract terms with HSV, so Tottenham could try to convince him to refuse, but why would he if he's successful there?  Spurs have already told him twice that he's not good enough and he doesn't fit in, why come back and sit on the bench if he's in HSV's starting XI?  

The fact that Tottenham agreed to a fee up front means that the club doesn't want him, but HSV wanted a loan-to-by deal to mitigate their risk.

If I started listing stories we'd be here all day but they included stop searches for no reason as well as as a victim of crime and getting a shitty attitude from the guy I was reporting to. I don't doubt there are countless good cops out there, but there are just as many that are idiots &amp; the few bad apples just doesn't fly. 

There are stories like this one here that come out on a regular basis, and this is just harassment, look to the news &amp; there is often much bigger stories of concern from Rotherham recently, though granted we don't know the full details. Or how police have behaved undercover fathering children or harassing activists. From my own experiences as mentioned above to the experiences of friends arrested at protests (The copper that killed Ian Tomlinson at the 2009 G20 protests got off with it, despite there being clear evidence of him posing know threat and being attacked by the officer.  Or the coppers covering their epaulets that were clearly pictured in scraps with protesters … you don’t do that unless you’re looking for a ruck) there is clearly a systemic issue at play that allows or even encourages bad policing and by dismissing it as a couple of idiots isn't going to solve that problem. 

Look to Standford Prison Experiment, any kind of POW mistreatment particularly Abu Ghraib for instances of what I mean here by how the system is the problem rather than the odd person.

As for young officers rising through the ranks ... I know openly racist people who applied &amp; got accepted to the Met. I've come up against young guys clearly spoiling for a fight, and where I pulled my mate aside to prevent it getting worse, the other police there just stood &amp; watched this officer get more &amp; more pushy trying to start something. When it was over, thankfully it remained relatively calm but a sober cop goading a boozed up guys is looking for trouble, I pulled the guy that had been searching me aside &amp; said he should keep his colleagues in check, the way I did with my friend. He just looked at my and asked what was he supposed to do? How about tell him to calm down or remove him from the situation??

It's these sort of coppers that ordinary, innocent people come into contact with every day &amp; it paints a really bad picture yet nothing is ever done.  This dude OP posted about is being treated as guilty before being given a chance to defend himself, and because of that is being treated in a wholly unprofessional manor . That goes against everything out judicial system is based on. 

As I say I'm sure there are plenty of you doing a wonderful job (I've read Wasting Police Time &amp; know of the pressures you face too) but there is definitely some serious issues that need working out throughout the police as a whole.  And that is just the UK, look at the US where there is so clearly institutionalised racism throughout all their departments across the country, and the response in Fergerson recently … I’m just so thankful you guys don’t carry guys as standard here.

I too welcome body cameras. I believe it would be beneficial to both parties. So long as we can be guaranteed they'll never be switched off or ever mysteriously stop working.

I haven't read her speech, but in many cases I think we should.  

I think we should strive to minimize racism and to avoid unintentionally hurting others with careless speech, but I also think that there's a danger of becoming paralyzed with fear of criticizing anyone who's not a white middle-class male for fear of being called a bigot.

We've got to the point where people feel unable to point out problems in Muslim communities because they will be branded as Islamophobic.  Surely there's a problem when tens of thousands of British women have been subjected to FGM without any prosecutions until very recently?  Surely it's an issue when an official report concludes that  ['Fears of Islamophobia gave activists free rein in Birmingham schools'](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/18/trojan-horse-birmingham-scathing-report-islamophobia)?

I'm absolutely against people using racist or prejudicial speech to stir up hatred of minorities.  However, some forms of political correctness are now impeding quite reasonable people from speaking their minds on difficult subjects.

In Scotland you have two massive cultural cities in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Glasgow is cheaper to live in, but if you're willing to live slightly outside Edinburgh and travel in it can be just as cheap.

Well, I think we should take the report seriously and not disbelieve what it says simply because it clashes with our own personal politics.  As I pointed out, a report into the Birmingham schools takeover said much the same thing.  We also have corroborating testimony from interviews of people in the media over the last few days.

Are the police and local services filled with politically correct do-gooders?  Of course not!  But they don't have to be.  The point is that they were under pressure to be seen to not behave in a discriminatory fashion towards Muslim groups.

No, I really just wanted to consider what the trajectory of the club is over the medium to long term. How have we changed since the Radknapp days? Have we merely kept pace with the rest of the League (no small feat--see the number of former PL clubs that have found themselves in the Championship or lower)? What were we trying to do with AVB, and is the rationale behind hiring Pochetino the same?

I got to thinking about all this because I saw someone discussing the future of the club. He argued that once the new stadium was built, we'd be sold and ""hopefully be bought by someone like the owners of City or Chelsea."" When I think of how disgusting those clubs are in terms of the sources of their money, or how United spends money, it made me realize that I really don't want that.

That said, the road is long, and many amazing young attackers peak early and fall away, from as long back as George best to more recent examples of Owen and Rooney (touch wood). But fuck, it is such an amazing thought to imagine Raheem at 28, still playing for LFC having made 400+ appearances for the club and by some miracle still improving, scoring 30 goals a season and assisting 20!   

I digress. I am of the opinion that he will not leave for a very long time, given we perform to our potential and start winning silverware regularly for the next decade. If he is sold at age 29 to some appealing club, I am sure LFC fans will send him on his merry way with tears of joy. But as for leaving in the next 2 seasons, I am highly doubtful.

Just as a cautionary note, reddit has sitewide rules about submitting only your own content which has led to many prominent users being ""shadowbanned"" from the site.

The basstunedtored blogger recently got shadowbanned for doing a similar thing on this subreddit and as such we haven't really seen any of his content being posted here since then, so it can be a pretty big blow for driving traffic if the majority of your site traffic is coming from reddit.

WHOAAAAA

There are anti-Semitic cities like Łódź, but the anti-Semitism is not from nowhere, Jews after the war came back to the city (which was mostly Jewish before WW2) with claims ""this tenement belongs to me, it belonged to my grandfather 10 years before WW2, so it should be my now!"", there are even (unfunny) jokes about that how someone sold a tenement, left Poland with cash, went to US/Canada, came back after the war with his son, and had pretensions about ownership. But from my experiences it's limited to a few cities. 

And just to add some to the context, take a short read:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_Jews_by_Poles_during_the_Holocaust

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland

&gt;Since the fall of Communism there has been a Jewish revival in Poland, characterized by the annual Jewish Culture Festival, new study programmes at Polish high schools and universities, the work of synagogues such as the Nozyk, and the Museum of the History of Polish Jews.

How can this be anti-Semitic?

And yes, if cameras result in more confidence in the police doing their job, better evidence leading towards more convictions and better protection against violent citizens, why would they _not_ want to spend money on them? Police forces spend money on _all kinds_ of things that they hope will help them improve various metrics.

The Met appear to be in favour of them - or at least trying them to see if they help. Various other police forces around the country appear to have the same position. [Here is an article](http://www.wypf.polfed.org/2014/02/20/will-all-cops-end-up-with-cameras/) by the West Yorkshire Police Federation (with quotes from the Essex Police Federation) singing the praises of them because they cut paperwork. It also mentions they're funded out of grants, not police budgets.

&gt;Nigel Rabbitts, of Devon and Cornwall Police Federation, said there are ‘only plusses’ to the kit and that at his force, guilty pleas have gone “through the roof”. He added: “It is a really good tool.
Every officer on duty should be wearing one.”

Yes I was travelling without a ticket, (this was years ago, I make sure to always pay my way now) as I had a job interview in London while I was living in Southend at the time.

 Was unemployed and the job centre refused to help with the cost of travel as it was 'too short notice'.

When stopped by the revenue officer on the way home I told him I had no ticket and will suffer what ever consequences came with that. He proceeded to act really rude, called me a liar, and didn't believe the details I had given him were correct as he couldn't link my name to my address at the time on whatever system they use. I told him that's probably because I lived in a bed and breakfast and offered my past address.  

Not happy with writing me a penalty fare and sending me on my way, he made me get off the train, at which point he summoned 4 security guards, 1 of whom immediately physically restrained me, even though I was standing still willing to cooperate. So naturally I got pissed off and starting having a go at everyone. At which point I was deemed a danger to the station staff.

 The police were called and I was arrested for racially aggravated assault, when at most all I was guilty of was public disorder and travelling on the railway without a valid ticket. 

Got to court and I was told by my barrister that I might as well plead guilty as the CCTV wasn't working that night, and I had no witnesses to stand for me. 

The CCTV would have shown that I never assaulted anyone, and would of saved me 200 hours community service, a 2 year probation order, anger management classes and a 7 month sentence suspended for 18 months. 

The other incident, I was completely in the wrong and CCTV wouldn't have helped my case was just mentioning that the CCTV wasn't working.

true,ashmaht,tardis,TARDIS,"I'm gonna be honest, your last response was a bit rude. I'm not trying to get into an argument with you, I just think this an interesting discussion. 

Regarding the fixed point, the Doctor being at Trenzalore was not a fixed point. It was a moment in flux. The Doctor visiting his grave made it a fixed point, but I'm fairly sure he's the only one who knows about fixed points? That part has always been unclear.

Anyway, the Kovarian chapter seems to have *made* the fixed point at Lake Silencio. They were actively trying to change the future, which was addressed in Smith's last episode when he references The Destiny Trap. By trying to stop him, the Kovarian chapter had actually ensured that he'd make it to Trenzalore. 

However, they did arguably succeed in their goals (hence no longer hunting the Doctor) as he did not say his name and unleash a new Time War (yet). 

As for the Tesselecta, it cannot subvert fixed points, but what is fixed and what is in flux does seem to be up for debate. After all, they ""punish"" war criminals, which effectively means they're changing the past anyway. If they were always meant to be a part of the fixed point (or if the fixed point was the *appearance* that the Doctor had died) then there really isn't a paradox at all.

As for the Timeline issue in series 7, I'll absolutely admit that I'm not fully clear on what Moffat's intention was there. I have my own personal theory that works for me, but I don't know if it's accurate. Moffat may've written himself into a corner.

In my personal head canon for that scene, it just seems to make sense that the Doctor could effectively ""rescue"" Clara from his timeline because he's living it. I mean, how does the Doctor get ""trapped"" in his own timeline anyway? He's effectively *in* his timeline all the time, right? So that's fine by me. Clara enforced the fixed points that the GI was trying to subvert. He'll likely return down the road. Hell, Moffat could still wrap this up if Clara's ending is her ""remembering"" one of the GI's plans as its happening and then sacrificing herself to save the Doctor again.

Or they just never encounter it in a meaningful way. Lets say that in a force, there are 98 officers that do everything by the book, and 2 that will ""do corrupt shit"". The 2 make sure that whenever they do stuff (intentionally, at least), each other are the only ones that witness it. The 98 good officers might occasionally see procedure being skirted around, but other than that, the only thing they could notice is that these two officers end up on patrol a lot together.

true,lgf92,null,null,"The cost of living in London is somewhat hyperbolically exaggerated by people, but it is genuinely higher than the rest of the country. 

To take a simple example, you could get a three-course meal in a mid-range restaurant in Newcastle with a glass of wine for about £20, £15 if there's a special deal on. In London that might set you back more like £25-35. Prices in supermarkets will tend to be the same or at least similar, but you will pay more for almost everything else, and with accommodation taking up a hefty share of your outgoings, paying £700-800 minimum in the outskirts of London, plus your transport costs, means that living in a more affordable city will give you, proportionally, a much greater quality of life. The only thing that tends to be cheaper in London is public transport. 

For reference, a pint in a bar in central Newcastle might set you back £3.50 or £4+ in the swankier bars. Student pubs and those further away might do it for £2.60 or £2.90. However, £4 is your very base price in London. I have paid over £6 for a spirit and a mixer in bars in London.

The last three especially are kind of artsy bohemian ones, whereas the Theatre Royal is where all the big shows are. 

I couldn't speak about acting programmes, but Newcastle has two universities: Newcastle University and Northumbria University. Northumbria has a Drama department and Society, while Newcastle has a Theatre Society and offers drama classes. 

It's important to understand (as is often discussed on AskUK) that the concept of ""ghetto"" doesn't really translate from North America to the UK. There are slightly rougher areas (generally south of the river - Blaydon, Pelaw - or in the west and north - Elswick, Byker, Scotswood) but no area of the city is unsafe to live in or walk through at night. Even if you do live in one of these areas, the worst it will get is a few youths hanging round outside a shop as you go past, and they won't bother you if you don't bother them.

Crime in the city is generally low: [here are the Northumbria Police figures for July](http://www.northumbria.police.uk/include/images/2014-07_July.pdf#page=6). You can see that through July there were only 52 robberies and 188 burglaries in a city of over 500,000. The majority of ""violence against the person"" crimes are brought on by the city's incredibly active nightlife (voted 3rd best in Europe, behind London and Berlin) when people get a little tanked up and start lashing out. You can also see that crime is falling drastically, basically halving year-on-year as the city regenerates.

You can't just play musical chairs with dementia care. You can't really know when there'll be a vacancy (basically you are asking when someone is likely to die next to free a bed). Once you go out of hospital and are in a home you are ""in care"" if you are in hospital you are a ""bed blocker"" and so you take precedence over those in care. So even if you are on waiting lists people will get in over you due to being in hospital already, usually as a result of a dementia related accident or similar.

We're double fucked because there were no lasting power of attorney forms signed before she was declared unfit to make her own decisions which basically means the family are consulted about changes in care but we don't have a final say. We're working to get LPT forms but its' going to take a while. Again, you can't just ring up somewhere and ask for it.

I hear what you say, and I'm honestly not trying to stir/provoke.  But what you're describing is the kind of archetypal corruption that everyone would recognise as such - stealing drugs/money.

However, what constitutes _most_ corruption, and what many within the police don't seem to view as corruption (or at least haven't until recently, even at the top levels of the anti-corruption units) is 'noble cause' corruption (stacking or sweetening a case against a ""known villain""), and historical corruption where an officer has become a poacher turned gamekeeper and all previous sins are wiped clean.  Both of these are why the Met is riddled with corruption and has tied itself up in knots and blown not only its reputation but also a considerable number of important prosecutions and yet still has corrupt officers at the highest level.",0,1409690198,null,0,false,0,ck7dze2,t3_2f9crl,t1_ck7dze2,t1_ck7ba17,null,1427234251,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Torchwood was dark, especially so at times, and during that time it was stated quite clearly that the Doctor would never appear in person on Torchwood because of that. Doctor Who is, in part, a show designed to engage children of the ""young adults"" variety. That means there is a line in the sand when things would become *too* dark that they will never cross. 

As far as people dying, well... 10 and 11 really just made for an unusual reign where ""everybody lives."" Even the dead, by and large, were eventually rescued thanks to one paradox or another. 

Capaldi, so far, has been rather fantastic... He's different, and that's not a bad thing. The first episode was up and down a bit, but I believe the second was quite fun. Anybody who watched that going ""oh... Daleks again..."" missed quite a bit, in my opinion. (yeah, that's right other commenters, I'm talkin' t' you. what.)

Then there's the Chambers issue, he was our depth at RB and turns out is quite handy CB, we've got Alderweireld to cover that utility defender spot now.

So I think considering Boruc stayed Forster, Long and Mane make up the additions. A striker and an extra wide player were definitely on the shopping list. The only part of the team I think might have not been improved is defence, so yeah maybe in defence I'd agree with you.

I'll be interested to see what happens when Rodriguez gets fit again, assuming Mane comes good I think he'll be competing with Pelle to lead the line, or maybe Mane I guess. 

Either way for a long time it was all ""just hold on until J-Rod is fit again"" and me assuming he was going to walk back into the starting line-up. Now I think he's going to have to fight his way in which is a big positive I think.

The vote is on whether or not Scotland gets self-determination - self-determination will or will not happen *after* the referendum. Prior to the referendum there's no expectation of Scottish self-determination with which to assume a Scotland-only poll.

I'm not saying necessarily that anyone other than Scotland has a right to vote, just that you can't (yet) invoke self-determination - the referendum's not happened yet.

true,smokey815,num11,,"I usually use an absolute scale, but I'm admittedly generous.  

1 - I will likely never give a player a 1.  A 1 means they played as bad as I've ever seen someone play.  A 1 means I'm pretty sure I could have done a better job.  A professional footballer will never be that bad.  I hope.

2 - Very tough to be this bad too.  I don't think I'll ever give an attacker this, because it requires such an impressive contribution to the other team that I'm not entirely sure an attacker is capable of managing it barring giving up two penalties and getting red carded.

3 - My rating for Kaboul in this match.  Several key mistakes, incapable of handling the opposition, no real redeeming play.

4 - Dier's rating.  He made a few mistakes, but had moments of good play.  Penalty was harsh, he just struggled.

5 - I think this is what I gave Vert and ROse.  Not horrid, but overall disappointing and poor.  No real absurd mistakes, but just a general lack of contribution

6 - My default rating.  If you don't do anything spectacular in either direction, you get a 6.  This is usually where I start players.  Subs usually get a 6 unless they contribute a lot negatively or positively.

7 - Overall solid play, but nothing spectacular.  If a player is mostly anonymous but pops up with an assist or goal that was pretty run of the mill, I'll often give a 7.  And example would be Paulinho's assists.  He'd have gotten a 7 without the goal.  He was good overall, but not special.  Assist was opportunistic, but not particularly impressive.  You get the picture.

8/9 - Pretty blurry line here for me. Usually what I give someone who was one of the best on the pitch, did their job well, whether it was defensive or attacking.  

10 - This is the only thing that is remotely subjective.  If someone was a cut above other players who I felt played quite well, they'll get a 10.  I don't rate too many people 10s.  

That's my personal scale.  I'd like to try and work out a good one to try and get people to use to help normalize the ratings.  ",0,1409692552,null,0,false,0,ck7f74q,t3_2f316c,t1_ck7f74q,t1_ck7eukh,null,1427233433,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Then they should either leave her and end the relationship or accept violence as being part of the relationship (if they think she's worth it). 

The reason it's different to male-on-female domestic violence is because the man is almost always going to be far bigger and stronger than the woman so it's far more dangerous (let's be real Jason Statham's life was never at risk when Kelly Brook punched her). This also means it's by default more intimidating. Nowadays though I do think there's fewer reasons why a woman is forced to stay with a man who hits her compared to the 1970s say where women had fewer options so they should leave or accept violence as part of the relationship.

I don't count Guly or Osvaldo. I wasn't counting them last season when I wanted us to sign players for various positions so I'm not going to count them as outgoings either. They were both so unlikely to feature or contribute meaningfully for us I just always considered them not part of of the squad.

So yeah Long might be slotting in at the bottom of the striker pecking order but last season it felt like we only had Lambert, Rodriguez and Gallagher. Now we've got Pelle, Rodriguez Gallagher and Long. Long might just be making up the numbers in the end but I think he'll play ahead of Gallagher who hasn't really shown signs of being ready yet. 12M might be a lot for depth but if that's the issue Pelle was 8M, swap the prices and things are looking better already. Plus, Mayuka will be knocking around this season won't he? 

As for Ramirez, I always forget about him. He wasn't in the group of players I just stopped counting, but likewise it doesn't feel like we've lost an influential player. He definitely hasn't been essential to us, he was shaping up to be the midfield version of how you see Long. I think you said it best yourself, he'll either become the player we hope he can be with more playing time at Hull, or if he doesn't' we haven't lost anything of value.

This seems different to most, but I think Fazio and Chiriches are by far our strongest and most capable centre-backs just now, simply put Jan hasn't been himself in over 12 months now, and Chiriches does all he does with a much higher work rate (albeit a little raw)... 

Stambouli and Capoue would be an incredible pairing in Poch's system. Hard-working, strong, good in the tackle and willing and able to charge forward and make a smart pass. Ideal.

As for rose down the left wing, this is because the one thing we lack in our attack is width. Until that can be permanently sorted in January, Rose seems like a good option, and without the burden of tracking back I think his pace and direct running combined with good crossing could really open our attack up (plus just think how defensively solid our left side would be against the strength that chelsea, city and united now have down the right of their attacks).

You mention there being fewer reasons for a woman being forced to stay with a man, yet for men the opposite is true and so many male victims have so many reasons to stay with their abuser these days.

He is slightly better in the air, has the same great reflexes and 1 vs 1 abilities. But then he exceptional with his feet, and very quick off the line. He has won everything there is, was big in the Barca dressing room. He'd be a great asset and his experience would rub off on our younger players, notably the two Spaniards in defence.

Mignolet in my opinion is not even amongst the top 6 keepers in the league, whereas every other area in our squad is at least amongst the top 5. I'd take Cortouis, Cech, Hart, Lloris, De Gea and possibly Begovic/Caballero ahead of him. He's a good shot stopper, has good reflexes.... Name a decent keeper who hasn't got either of those qualities?

Of course Valdes will take time to recover, but personally I haven't seen any keepers regress that much after injuries but we will probably take him on trial to see what his fitness is like.

We were shit in defense last season. A combination of injuries/bad form left us too often in a situation where we had average CB's playing with average at best DM's in front of them.

We've brought in an experienced strong CB in Fazio, and an exciting young CB in Dier. Strengthened our LB position (which seems to have woken Danny Rose up) and then added another talented young DM in front of them in Stambouli.

Rather than having to trot our Kaboul and Dawson at CB with Bentaleb and Paulinho in front of them (both talented but not the strongest defensively) we can now run out with Vertonghen/Fazio with Capoue/Stambouli guarding them and breaking up play. 

I know defense isn't exciting, and a big attacking signing would have been great, but like it or not, you don't do very well in the league unless you're pretty solid at the back, and now I think we're more than solid.

We've already seen (granted it was only QPR but you can only play the team in front of you) that when we can pressure a team, turn the ball over and hit with pace on the counter attack the likes of Lamela, Eriksen etc will tear teams apart.

true,pinotage1972,null,null,"For the record, while Aguero scored more of his goals partnering with Negredo, that partnership was not the one when City were at their most prolific.   That came when Aguero was injured (December and January). 

Also - nearly all the Negredo/Aguero combo of goals came early in the season and heavily titled towards Premier League fixtures - 7 of 9 of Negredo's goals were with Aguero in PL play.   

For Negredo, he scored 12 goals while partnered with Aguero, and 11 goals while not (9 with Džeko and 2 when playing alone up front)

And it should be noted that a huge disproportion of Negredos goals with Aguero (almost half) came in just two fixtures against weaker opposition and one in a match that didn't have any real competitive meaning (vs West Ham, 2nd leg semi, COC, leading 6-0 on agg).    The other was the hat trick against CSKA Moscow.    

So, while good, I think the partnership success may be a little overblown by hype and not backed up by numbers.   

Negredo seemed to feast on bad opposition, with most of his goals with Džeko against weaker sides in the COC as well.  

He did score big goals too though, against Liverpool (partnered with Silva at that time), Bayern when we lost 3-1 at home, Arsenal in the 6-3 win.

true,bl4ckfriar,null,null,"It's a tricky one, because with amount you're receiving there isn't one defined answer. If it were 10k I would know what to do instantly!

I think the key here is that you're only looking for short to mid-term solutions, which would question the benefit of putting it into S&amp;S as they're typically recommended as long term investments.

Cash ISAs would give you a guaranteed return of just less than 3% - and that's only if you went for a 3/4 year fixed term. Not terrible, but a pain if you want to withdraw early.

Some current accounts at the moment offer better than ISA savings rates, but it may be too much of a hassle for you.

If it were me, I would do the following:

1) Read [this](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-loophole) and follow their guide. It's a great way to get 5% (pre-tax) on your savings up to a certain amount.  
2) Get a Club Lloyds account and stick 5k in there for 4% (pre-tax)  
3) Get a Santander 123 account and put 20k in there. It's 3% and gives you instant access.  
4) If you know you won't be needing it for 3 years get the highest rate cash ISA you can find and put 15k in there.  
5) Pay off your mortgage more quickly. It's a guaranteed 1.9% (I'm jealous it's so low). Maybe look at remortgaging - I don't know how long you have left on your current one.  

I know this doesn't cover the entire sum, but that's how I'd get started.

Obviously, if you don't need the entire sum after 3 years then I would put some of it towards balancing out your S&amp;S portfolio.

On a somewhat related note, is your student loan paid off pre-tax? Would it ever make sense to pay it off early?",0,1409694329,null,0,false,0,ck7g3r4,t3_2fao4x,t1_ck7g3r4,t3_2fao4x,null,1427232764,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

2 | Very Bad | Not nearly so bad as a 1 but still nothing you want to see from someone who plays for Spurs. Several key mistakes and probably a card to boot
3 | Quite Bad | A typical rating for a bad performance. Maybe they made a good play or two but it was clearly marred by their overall failure to play to the standards we hold so dearly at Spurs
4 | Below Average | The player made a few mistakes but none too costly. Overall, we expect better but probably won't raise pitchforks or #___Out them
5 | Average- | The player was largely unnoticable and played little impact on the game outside of their minimal duties.
6 | Average+ | The player had an average game, similar to a 5 but slightly better
7 | Good | Overall solid play, but nothing spectacular. The player was mostly anonymous but maybe popped up with an assist or goal that was pretty run of the mill
8 | Great | Well above the standard duties of their position but falls short of a 9. Could have been a 9 or 10 save for a few mistakes
9 | Fantastic | One of the best on the pitch. Contender for MOTM
10 | World Class Performance | MOTM; Player played a stand out performance and if consistently played this way would be a national starting 11 player- far above the standard duties of their position

I agree on a replacement for Toure. It could possibly be Wisdom? When BR took over he gave young players a chance. Sterling had played already but him and Suso became regulars under BR. Last season Flanagan did too. Coutinho has also been a regular under BR. Other youngsters have been banished on loan or moved on. Now BR had some money to spend he has massively upgraded the squad (which i'm all for) but this makes it even harder for younger players to break through.
