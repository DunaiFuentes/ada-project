Not to mention for some reason again it's not reflected in our cancer survival rate. Very odd indeed. It's the worst in Europe in fact.

This is inaccurate. You make a claim in your post about 'misleading' statistics and yet turn around and do it again in an attempt to make your bullshit point about how the NHS is the one of the worst healthcare systems in the world. Why don't you actually go and read up whats the difference between a survival rate and a mortality rate?

If you like to ride on paved surfaces, I second Undercliff Walk as a pleasant and easy ride. You can also get into the countryside very quickly. I prefer to go over Ditching Beacon (you might not want to go back that way since it's the biggest climb in Sussex, but it's still only a hill and you don't need super strong legs as long as you have low gears and patience). The other way is via Lewes. Getting to Lewes on a bike is nice but going back isn't so good and you might prefer to use the train (check Southern Railway cycle policy if you want to do that on a weekday).

The cycle layer on [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/50.8482/-0.1301&amp;layers=C) is good for bike rides and walks. In the country, yellow and white roads are usually nice for riding on. Official (Sustrans) cycle routes are highlighted but they vary a lot - the South Downs Way is one of them (route 89) but you don't really want to do that without a mountain bike. Route 20 towards London is safe but not enjoyable (or efficient once you get to Crawley).

Apart from roads, the red dotted lines are footpaths, blue and foot and bike paths, and green are bridlepaths (foot, bike and horse - some are good for bikes, some are very difficult).

So anyway - tips: the main factor involved in perfect wrapping is to cut the paper to the right size, because if it's way too much, you get lumps of bunched up paper when you fold the corners.

And it's useful to cut strips of sellotape to the right size and line them up on the edge of a biscuit tin or similar, so that you can hold the paper in place with one hand and grab a piece of sellotape with the other hand.",0,1403821460,null,0,false,0,cihzmfn,t3_296kpn,t1_cihzmfn,t3_296kpn,null,1434419922,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

I don't think that you can deny that most victims already don't speak up against rape and I think harsh sentencing can take away a lot of incentive to speak out as there is always a chance that someone could be punished for making a false accusations that actually turned out to be true, such as in this analogy:

“Ms A had reported to the police that she had been raped on three occasions by her husband, against a background of other domestic violence. As a result of her complaint, he was arrested and charged.
Some weeks later, Mrs A told the police that she no longer wished her husband to be prosecuted and that, whilst what she had said was true, they were now reconciled and she wanted to retract her allegations. 

Following careful consideration, the CPS Area decided that the prosecution should continue, because cases involving serious offences such as rape are not merely a private matter between the parties.
Upon being told that the case would continue, Mrs A said that she had lied in her statements and that her husband had never raped or otherwise assaulted her. This meant that there was no longer any evidence against him and therefore the case was stopped. The decision was made to charge Ms A herself with perverting the course of justice on the basis that she had made false allegations against her husband, who had as a result spent some time in custody awaiting trial.

However, after she was charged, Ms A then said that in fact the original allegations had been true. As a result she was further charged (in the alternative) with perverting the course of justice, on the basis that she had falsely withdrawn a true allegation. This situation is known as a ‘double retraction’.

Ms A pleaded guilty, but on the basis that her original allegations of rape were true and she had lied when she said that they were not. She was sentenced by the Crown Court to eight months’ imprisonment, which was reduced by the Court of Appeal to a community order. ”",0,1403821841,null,0,false,0,cihzsnf,t3_296cn3,t1_cihzsnf,t1_cihzn99,null,1435489119,-11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-11

Pretty sure this isn't the case. If you were banned from practising medicine in the UK I would expect in reality it would make it really hard to practice medicine in any country that had medical standards whatsoever - you'd have to work out the jurisdiction of most self-respecting medical bodies. To that extent, Suarez can always go play some other sport that isn't governed by FIFA.

&gt; Now if Fifa, the FA and UEFA are truly independent then this should be the case.

FIFA, UEFA and the FA explicitly *aren't* independent. FIFA is a union of Confederations and national associations, and UEFA is a union of European national associations.

Regarding scenario 1); Yes we miss our best player for the start of the season, however due to the incident he has less power in forcing a move, less potential suitors, and those who are still interested will not be willing to pay as much and therefore won't pay his buy-out clause. This is, from a cynical perspective, a *good thing* if you're only concern is Suarez staying. Missing games is unfortunate but if you offered me the choice before this happened between him missing the first 9 games and staying, or him leaving, I would have no hesitation in choosing the first, nor would any rational fan.

Regarding your second scenario, it's not fucking black and white! It's not a case of us wanting to sell or not wanting to sell.

* And last, and what I consider the most important point. He is a mediocre striker who never played in a major league *or* set any of his smaller leagues alight.  

He has only ever played in Turkey, Russia and South Africa and in none of those leagues has he ever been top goal scorer. 

His best ever season was in the Turkish **second** division where he scored 16 goals. Lukaku scored 17 for West Brom in the English Premier League as a 19 year old...

I would much much rather keep Demba Ba. There is nothing about Emenike that is impressive or makes him a better replacement for Ba.

A player using his elbow is quite commonplace when two players are jostling for a ball and looking to keep each other off it.  Players always use their elbows to try gain leverage over their opponent, and in some of those cases elbows can go astray.

Intentional elbows don't have a place of course but unless they are completely blatant, it's hard to tell if it's intentional or not.

Maybe I need to look at it again, but Sakho's elbow last night looks to me as if he's tying to shove the guy away using his elbow, which is perfectly fine to me, but accidentally catches  the guy in the face. Likewise with Neymar's on Modric, I don't think he meant to catch him in the face, even though he had a look first, I think he intended to use his elbow to keep Modric off him but misjudged it.

No, I think he bit someone in Uruguay for the same reason he bit Ivanovic, Bakkal, and sued Groningen.  He very specifically didn't do it in England as the FA would have banned him for a year or more.

The other alternatives are he's got mental issues, which is what you seem to think.  Fair enough and could be the case, but again, if so then he shouldn't be playing professional football until he can be properly evaluated, treated, then re-evaluated until it can be assured he doesn't represent a danger to other players.  I imagine that process will take the better part of a year or so and I hope he gets the help he needs.

Lastly, perhaps he's just a dick that likes to bite people when he gets angry at them.

I can honestly see both sides of the argument, you and /u/Vinpan2. On the one hand, he's such a brilliant player of course it would hurt to lose someone like that. There's **no way** I'd sell him for less than £55m **plus** Sanchez, or £80m cash to anyone else. Not a chance in hell I'd sell him for less, even now. Before the bite, I would've said £100m, but I can't see people paying that now he's out till Halloween.

That being said, I feel Suarez has lost a lot of people's trust in the past 24 hours. All that hard work the club did from last summer, supporting him, convincing him to stay, sticking by him through yet another controversy...I can't help but feel he's just kicked it all up in our face again. Of course, he didn't intentionally do it, but he's really screwed us over right now. I wouldn't be surprised if Rodgers, FSG and the rest of the team are also really annoyed at him right now, too.

Of course we can't replace him directly, that'll never happen. But we can go a long way to replacing him with the funds he'd give us (on top of what we have already). If we can have two 20-goal a season strikers (Sturridge and a new guy) and use the Suarez money to finally fix our fucking useless defence (I make no secret I'm not a fan of our back four at all), we'll win the league still. Teams can win the league by scoring 90 goals (21 less than we did last season). Teams do not win the league by conceding 50 though, like we did. No player is bigger than the club and if the club gets an acceptable offer and sells, so be it. We'll move on and sign the other players we need. Either way we'll be fine. I just really don't want us to be Saurez's owners if he should do this a 4th time. Because then we're fucked.

EDIT: Oh sorry, to answer your question. If there was no Liverpool ban, I'd be less inclined to sell him definitely, but I'd still be open to offers.

There are plenty of books on Cambrian life though- especially the lagerstatten such as the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang (Chinese equivalent of the BS).

Where's the outrage for that?

The point I'm making is that people are freaking out over the fact that someone bit someone, as if it's some heinous crime the likes of which has never been seen. But really, it's just another case of violent conduct. 

Incidents of violent conduct happen relatively often. Song's elbow, Neymar's Elbow, Assou-Ekotto's headbutt. 3 Incidents of violent conduct from this world cup alone. Suarez should be banned. But the ban they've given him is one game longer than the ban they gave for breaking someone's nose with an elbow. And on top of that, they've banned him from all football related activities for 4 months. How do you rationalise giving a harsher punishment for a bite (that did no significant or lasting harm) than you do for someone breaking a player's nose?

The decision has been made in response to a hysteria that's unwarranted. Lots of players have had reputations for violent conduct (or for being football's hard-men) and yet it's different for Suarez because his method of violence was biting?

 [**Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football%20hooliganism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;Beginning in at least the 1960s, the UK had a reputation worldwide for [football hooliganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism); the phenomenon was often dubbed the *English Disease*.     However, since the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government has led a widescale crackdown on football related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations rather than at the matches themselves.

true,bairy,null,null,"I don't really have experience with accomodation and I don't go to into the city much. I can offer some pointers but I'm afraid without doing a lot of research I can't recommend anywhere specific.

In general, B&amp;Bs offer free wireless and breakfast, hotels generally charge for both. B&amp;Bs are generally much smaller and not as sound proofed, but the staff are much more friendly.

Most areas around the city have plenty of shops. The north of the city has a bad rep but I don't know if that's founded.

The QE is just a few minutes from the train service which is every 10 minutes during the day. Obviously for that to be useful you'd want to stay near a station on the cross city line: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Birmingham_Cross-City_Line.png - looking on booking.com there aren't all that many of those, I realise. Do be aware that Birmingham is undergoing a TON of construction, centered around New Street Station. If you're okay with queues, crowds and some confusion on where to go then great. The downside is that New Street is the only city centre station that serves the cross city line.

By bus, all these busses serve the QE with varying degrees of frequency: http://nxbus.co.uk/west-midlands/links/hospitals/queen-elizabeth-hospital/ - If you click the numbers you can do a map view and cross check that with where accomodation is located. booking.com has heard of a few of the place names too. You can get bus passes for £16 a week, or £57 a month. Note that almost all our busses don't give change, nor can you get return tickets.

By taxi I would generally advise city centre for black cabs (that you can hail / just get in) or you're looking at phoning and waiting for either black cab or private hire.

The only major chain I have personal experience in is Radisson Blu, and that was in Cardiff. Got a gigantic very quiet room, free wireless but not free breakfast. Rooms are not the cheapest. It's a few minute walk from New Street, or it'd be two busses so not particularly convinient.",0,1403830729,null,0,false,0,cii3pwb,t3_296fk2,t1_cii3pwb,t1_cii2evu,null,1434421785,1,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,1

It works like this. The War Doctor didn't go by the name Doctor. He didn't pop in and say, ""Hello! I'm the Doctor."" He rejected the name entirely. So while he used a regeneration, he didn't use the title. Which basically was the whole point. To kick through the 12 regenerations limit and get it out of the way, while also preserving what everyone already calls the newer Doctors, namely Ecc is the 9th Doctor, Tennant is the 10th, Smith is the 11th, and Capaldi is the 12th. The writers at the BBC haven't changed how they reference the characters, see the 50th Anniversary script, so neither should we.

They don't call Capaldi the 13th Doctor in the Anniversary special. The line is, ""Great, now there's three of them,"" referencing Tennant, Smith, and Hurt. Another character responds, ""No, all 13!"" to account for the 13 actors who have played the role. But again, Hurt doesn't count as ""The Doctor"", so Capaldi is referred to as the 12th Doctor.",0,1403830793,null,0,false,0,cii3qvb,t3_29714o,t1_cii3qvb,t3_29714o,null,1434421798,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

That's where the bullshit tribal mentality that you enjoy comes from. Think about it.

I'm too old for all of that and tired of having the same conversation with each freshly sprouted mouth in every generation. I'm going to take a guess and say that you're young. You support United not because you're from Salford, but because they were winning for a while.

true,DrCrazyFishMan1,null,null,"okay, say that instead of biting, stamping, elbowing, punching or any form of violent conduct, what about if Suarez had thrown his own faeces at players instead? obviously having faces on you isn't as bad as being punched, of stamped, or having your leg broken by a terrible challenge, so does that make it not worthy of a lengthy ban? 

Why is throwing faeces worse than elbowing someone, or kicking someone, or headbutting someone, or stamping someone? I understand that psychologically and socially, throwing faeces is much more disturbing (i found it funnier than the normal acts of violence but w/e), but how does that make it that much worse to justify the extra punishment? It is NOT more malicious, it is NOT more dangerous, it is NOT more reckless, it is simply more uncomfortable for people to see, and I do not think that for that reason alone, it is deserving of greater punishment.

people are uncomfortable with many things. I myself feel uncomfortable when i see a morbidly obese person, or an extremely anorexic person, but i don't think its fair to judge these people more harshly because i feel uncomfortable. i found suarez's faeces throwing funny rather than uncomfortable, but even if i did find it uncomfortable, I would not think its fair to punish him more harshly just because his act of transgression made me feel more uncomfortable. (if he was extraordinarily dangerous or malicious, then that would be fair grounds for harsher punishment)

People suggest that 'throwing faeces' carries its own set of dangers such as infection or w/e. Are these dangers really more dangerous than elbows/kicks/punches/headbutts/stomps or are they just different?

To sum it up: throwing faeces is not the same as elbowing/punching another person, but is it worse? psychologically it is much more uncomfortable to see, but is that grounds for (extraordinary) harsher punishment? Suarez is a repeat offender but when did football mete out extra-punishment for repeat offenders (rooney, ramos, pepe comes to mind)?

do you see the parallels in your arguments here?

surely you are not suggesting that a player who habitually defecates in his own hand and throws it at opposition players would not warrant a very lengthy ban such as Suarez's 4 month ban - if anything if he was to do that it would warrant an even lengthier ban - but the reasons you are saying that Suarez's ban is too harsh can be used in EXACTLY the same way that I am using for throwing faeces

I think you have to have the faith in your players to some degree. I think we haven't been able to dominate the midfield with possession because our players just haven't been good at it. We have had athletic, direct players in the midfield for ages now, and as a result I'm hard pressed to think of a time in the last few years in which we truly outplayed a top class team (the city game you are referring to was the closest, but they were so injury stricken they were playing Demichelis in midfield so I have an asterisk on that one).

We play every big game like we are some sort of scrappy underdog, with Ramires and Luiz and whoever running around like mad, keeping play in the midfield choppy, and poaching goals. When we won games against quality opposition last year (and really for a few years before) it's always a dismal affair. We celebrated an uber-defensive, stolen win against *Liverpool* ffs. I want to be a team that people play against and they say ""we got so outplayed we barely touched the ball.""

I'm sorry I'm ranting so hard here, it's just that this team, with all the quality in it, seems like it could be so much more. No squad with Hazard, Oscar, Fabregas, Matic, Willian, and Schurrle should be playing rope-a-dope counterattack.

Most of the stuff you've put down for grades are similar to mine on entry (I got A*A*A*A at A level and a silver on the chemistry olympiad). Competition for places will be quite tough, but with those credentials, you'll almost certainly get an interview. Job and general engineering experience isn't essential, but it will look good on your application. The bike maintenance probably won't be taken much into account, but it'll probably be really useful, especially since you'll inevitably own a bike at Cambridge.

What you'll want to do in the meantime: make sure you *understand* your A level courses. From the Silver Chemistry Olympiad, I get the feeling you understand your subject rather than learning it by rote, which is good. The last thing interviewers want is somebody who got their fantastic exam grades just by memorising how to do exam questions. To help, make sure to try and read around different bits of your subject. To get in the engineering mindset, I can highly recommend Henry Petroski books.

She can't be extracted from CAL Because only her mind was preserved, everyone else was abducted mid-transport. Apparently, the way the Library's Transmat/teleporter works is living mass is converted into data and reassembled at the destination. What CAL did was prevent the transmat system from rematerializing, preserving Donna's and the library patrons' data patterns in the computer core.

If you remember, Miss Evangelista's body was completely destroyed,  eaten by the Vashta Nerada. However, her mind link preserved a copy of her brain, which CAL wirelessly captured and uploaded to the computer core. A similar thing happened to River - her body was destroyed by the high voltage. Knowing this, the future Doctor hid a mind link in her sonic screwdriver, knowing his past self would find it and upload the copy of her brain.

As for being trapped? We know that she she can somehow telepathically communicate to the outside, because she was able to have that psychic ""teleconference"" with Clara and the Paternoster gang in The Name of the Doctor. I'd bet that they're not the only ones she contacts in that manner.

Aside from that, River and her crew have the option to live in recreations of the worlds of every single book in the library. An infinite amount of time to explore billions and billions of worlds, I can't see her having a problem with that.

Half year before that he was even worse.  People that call Sturridge selfish really seem to have forgotten Suarez's first season and a half.

6).  Every time I turn around, he causes some sort of fucking controversy.

7).  Diving.  God I hated his diving.

8).  Constantly bitching at everyone for not giving him the ball or doing things he doesn't like.

9).  I won't even try to pick out his smaller issues- kicking Ivanovic and Parker, pulling Rafael's hair, raking various people's Achilles, and the many other more minor dirty things he has done in games and not gotten called on.

I could deal with most of those, but 1, 2, and 3 massively bother me.  If you don't want to play for Liverpool FC, then get the fuck out.",0,1403841233,null,0,false,0,cii8635,t3_296b7z,t1_cii8635,t1_cii6zsu,null,1434424430,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1

If you ask a footballer whether he'd rather be on the end of a bite, or the end of a reckless two-footed challenge I can guarantee they'll say the bite every time. But that's by the by.

We see players getting in scraps, or going toe-to-toe and just accept it as ""heat of the moment"" stuff, which to a degree is understandable, but they're still violent acts that are setting a bad example to kids which often go (seriously) unpunished.

Biting is something that we don't understand. It's the act of a nutcase, quite frankly, but IMO the punishment is that much harsher because we don't understand it. We see a player headbutt his own teammate and think, ""wow he must be really pissed off, it was just heat of the moment though"" and no-one kicks up a fuss. When Suarez loses it, he bites. Clearly this is unacceptable but to my mind it's no more unacceptable than headbutting your own teammate.

He played at Boro this season a little bit, and had a good run last season at The Hague with like 30 appearances. Ligue 1 is a little more competitive than the Dutch top division, and the Championship.

This is from Deuteronomy 13, which belongs to Deuteronomy 12-26, also know as the Deuteronomic code.  
This code is specifically and exclusively directed at Jews and reminds them how they are to conduct themselves in the Promised Land, which they were about to enter. It also regulates, among other things, that workers are to be payed correctly, the appointment of judges and the prohibition to bribe them, dietary laws, and it institutes a number of Jewish religious festivals.  
If Christians are inspired by it to acts of violence, then that is their individual interpretation and choice. But it is no more of an obligation than observing Jewish dietary restrictions. 
So, no, ""destroying entire cities is the answer to not being Christian"". It is the answer to how Jews should deal with polytheists in the promised land after the chosen people (aka Jews) had entered it.   
To summarise: It is a specific command, to a specific ethnic group, limited to a specific time and a specific geographical region.

Okore underwent surgery and missed the remainder of a campaign which saw Villa limp home in 15th place after another worrying battle for survival.

It’s left Lambert under pressure after a season which saw many of last summer’s recruits fail to shine and Okore is counting down the days until he can prove his worth.

“It’s about next season for me. That’s my focus. I am looking forward to that. I can’t wait. It can’t come quick enough,” he says.

“It will be the coming season when I get my big chance again to prove myself. I want to show what I can do.

Bloody white knights are running their mouths all over the media, saying that Suarez should never play football again, that he is a disgrace blah blah blah, the same people were praising him a few days ago for his passion and skill when he demolished England. A few teeth marks later he suddenly becomes the big villain of football again. 

I honestly don't get it. Biting is weird, uncivilised, animalistic, but the physical and mental effect this act has on its victim is surely not as severe as breaking somebody's leg? 

Also, why should this even be news? It's NEWS only if it's new. We all knew about Suarez's shortcomings, and we have seen him mature last season, but was it such a shocking possibility that he may have moments of relapse? I don't really get why this is making waves among people who already know football and know Suarez. Ban the guy, fine the guy, make him go for anger management/mental therapy sessions, move on.

And it stems from the Revolutionary War (The Americans fighting the British were known as Patriots). Here we take great pride in our country. I joke around a lot and say we are best at everything. Honestly were are just as normal as every other country. We just like to be patriotic and boast about our country being the best, because in most Americans minds, we (including myself) feel that America is the best country because we have never been outside of the United States. 

The reason most outsiders to the United States think we are so bad is because you only hear the bad things. For example, you are probably under the impression that there are more mass shootings here in the United States than ever before. It's actually opposite. There are fewer now than before, the media just picks up on them way more now because of advancements in technology (ex. Social Media, cameras literally a tap away). 

I may hate the people running the country, but I love the country itself. I could sit here and say America is perfect, but then I would be lying. When you actually get down to it, no country is perfect. You're just picking what country is best in your view. I feel that America fits me perfectly. I own several guns, but only shoot one or two of them. The rest are hobbies. I may take some to a friends house to shoot targets every now and then. 

I may not agree with the politicians in office, but I just have to wait a few years and vote. If my candidate loses, I don't care. The people decided and obviously they disagreed. People complain that corporations have bought out the government, but that's not true. You can give someone all the money you want, but that isn't going to make other people like the person you're giving money to.

“Currency [bank notes and coins] only accounts for a very small amount of the money held by people and firms in the economy. The rest consists of deposits with banks.

“97% of the money held by the public is in the form of deposits with banks, rather than currency.” (Bank of England - Money in the modern economy: an introduction)

If you're a post-grad, you follow PI's with your research interest more so than an institution's reputation. If you're doing a specialised course like Primary Education, Trent is very well regarded. It's also one of the best non ""red-brick"" institutions for science, which it has invested heavily in over the last few years.

If you're studying an art like English, or pursuing a career in law, your degree might not be held with as much regard in that field's job market. That being said, in most fields it won't come down to the institution once you reach interview level, and if it's not your first job, it probably won't factor into the selection process as much as you may think.

Nottingham is probably my favourite city in the UK. It has a nice mixture of a metropolitan and suburban feel. The city centre is well managed, connected, and has a variety of shops and restaurants. Transport is great, government ran. Much better than other nearby cities like Leicester. Busses to campuses run frequently, and there is a tram service that operates to several places.

The people are known historically for Robin Hood, and more recently for gun crime. Though, I always feel very safe in Nottingham, and have never had any issues. There is a commendable police presence in the city centre, particularly on Friday/Saturday nights.

true,apr400,null,null,"Harborne as others have said is a nice area, and will have the best choice of restaurants, shops and pubs close to the hospital, but short on hotels. It is walking distance to the hospital. If you are going to be here for a few weeks your best choice might be talking to one of the local rental agencies about a short apartment rental - they're all on the web. There is generally lots of availability at this time of the year. I think there are some service apartments too. 

The closest hotel to QE is probably the University of Birmingham conference centre. Whilst an unconventional choice I think it is bookable for non-conference stays, [see here](http://www.venuebirmingham.com/sleep). This would be about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the hospital. The University campus/hospital environs are a pleasant place for a walk, and have various things to do such as a rather good free art gallery, concerts, small shops etc. on campus. 

Selly Oak is the other area relatively close to the hospital. It is a longer walk and is primarily a student accommodation area, so somewhat less salubrious, and again not much in the way of hotels.    

As far as I can remember I can't remember seeing too many black cabs waiting at the hospital, but both [black cabs](http://www.toataxis.co.uk/) and mini-cabs ([one choice of many](http://www.castlecars.co.uk/)) are available by phone or web and will come within ten to twenty minutes. There will probably be a taxi phone in the hospital lobby. 

If you go for the option of staying in the city centre, I would suggest getting a hotel close to either New Street Station or Five Ways Station. The former will be better for quiet evenings (pubs, restaurants, walks) as the latter pretty close to the main nightlife/clubbing area, and the hotels there tend to be noisy - particularly Fri/Sat. 

The Macdonald Burlington is the closest to New Street Station but is somewhat run down by all accounts. There are a few others in the area - Malmaison, Radisson Blue, Smallbrook Queensway Holiday Inn are all walking distance to New Street Station.

true,starbuckluce,null,null,"I've just graduated from the University of Nottingham, which is considered the ""better"" University, but I am going to be starting a Masters at Trent in September. 

Nottingham Trent is one of the better Polys in the country, and it has fantastic links with many businesses and they have incredible facilities for Psychology/Criminology/Forensic students as well as science students. Their research divisions are also top-notch. I've also got many friends at Trent, and I have found it to be a lot more laid back than Uni of Nottingham. 

As someone mentioned before, it does depend on the type of degree you're doing. If you're going to be an undergrad then Trent is fantastic for vocational subjects. If you're pursuing the Arts or Sciences, I would say that Trent are good but UoN would be regarded as ""better"" because it's a redbrick Russell group Uni. Honestly though, I don't think it matters too much. If you study hard and get a good degree classification, I don't think going to a poly will swing it too much.

Also, don't be surprised to hear middle-class UoN students yelling: ""Your dad works for my Dad!"" if you go to Trent. As a working class student who went to University of Nottingham, I felt very different from everybody else. I mean, there were people at my Uni who wouldn't talk to people from Trent and vice versa. Those people are douches. Like I said before, many of my friends are from Trent so don't hesitate to make friends from both establishments!

I grew up in Nottingham, and then went to the University of Nottingham because I absolutely love the city. Student housing is pretty brilliant, and they're currently building a new complex for Trent students. Transport links are pretty fantastic too and because you're in the city you'll be close to the train station, the two bus depots and you're only a 45 minute bus ride away from East Midlands Airport. 

You won't feel like an old fart - I'm 21, but I lived with a 32 year old undergrad and he was probably the most sociable dude I knew! The Students' Union, if you're classed as a ""mature student"", run specific events in the first week of term for you, but obviously you can go to anything. He started off going to just mature student events so he could meet people his own age, but ended up just going to societies and meeting people. Age doesn't really matter, and you're still young!

I didn't like the student run night club scene, but fortunately there is so much in Nottingham that there is more than one alternative scene! The LGBT scene is fantastic in Nottingham - Propaganda and NG1 are the gems. The indie scene is also good - Bodega, Spanky van Dykes and Jam Cafe  (http://www.jamcafe.info) are great and the latter is good for a chill night out. There are swing nights, metal nights, jazz nights... Essentially, Nottingham has a great night scene and there will be somewhere you love.

During the day, there are a tonne of art galleries (the Contemporary is good and free!) two cinemas, several bowling allies, crazy-golf, laser tag, museums and a lot of local history. I doubt you will ever be bored!

The suggestion that the monarchy promotes tourism is untrue. There is not a single shred of evidence to back this up. Of the top 20 tourist attractions in the UK only one royal residence makes it: Windsor Castle at number 17 (beaten comfortably by Windsor Legoland, in at number 7). Royal residences account for less than 1% of total tourist revenue. Indeed, the success of the Tower of London (number 6 in the list) suggests that tourism would benefit if Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle were vacated by the Windsor family. 

&gt;Without the royal family they are just shiny objects and posh buildings. They mean something with the royal connection, something most Tourists will never have in their own country.

So why does the Tower of London get more visitors than Buckingham, considering it's just shiny objects in a posh building?

&gt;Certainly not as popular as they are over here. Look at American tourists, they hardly care about French castles, they are just old buildings. America has old buildings too (Not as old, but still quite old). They are just don't mean anything if they aren't lived in by royalty.

Can you provide any evidence or numbers to back up this claim? Versailles, a vacated palace, gets millions of tourists per year. Buckingham tourists are measured in the hundreds of thousands.

The union of the Crowns of England and Scotland was a very different thing to the union of the countries. The former happened in 1603, the latter in 1707. Between 1603 and 1707 there was no ""United Kingdom"", just England, Scotland and Ireland who happened to be ruled by the same monarch. The ""United Kingdom"" (of Great Britain) only came into existence with the Acts of Union with Scotland in 1707.

Ireland had shared a common monarch with England since 1542 but only joined the UK as a constituent country in 1801. Most of it then left in 1922 necessitating a name change for the country from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland but the British monarch actually remained ""King of Ireland"" until 1949 when Ireland officially became a republic. The specification of what the United Kingdom consisted of changed to NI only as that was what constituted the *country*, the fact the King was actually still King of all Ireland in a personal capacity was not relevant but as the UK was still the UK just with less territory there was no need to drop the ""UK"" bit. 

I mean Canada, Australia and the UK still have a common monarch, but are clearly independent countries. 

You would have an argument if Northern Ireland also left leaving just England and Wales as Wales was part of the Kingdom of England since at least 1542 but this was not known as the ""United Kingdom"", it was simply ""England"". As long as NI stays in though you have a ""United Kingdom"", if it goes you could make an argument for ""England and Wales"" or indeed just ""England"" as that term actually legally and historically includes Wales although I suspect the former would be more likely not to piss the Welsh off.

This dry read really digs in to the absolute unaccountability of FIFA, in this case acting as a court with far reaching financial impacts.

FIFA is a non for profit association registered in Switzerland. 

From TFA 
&gt;In short, FIFA lies almost entirely outside the reach of any form of supervisory accountability. Its members are typically
weak associations with little inﬂuence in domestic governments. In any case, domestic governments have no formal
mechanism to directly sanction FIFA for any cause. The only exception is the Swiss government under whose laws FIFA is
incorporated. Experience to date suggests that such a direct legal supervision necessarily focuses on very narrow issues of

I don't think we should stand behind Suarez because he is a great player. I think we should stand behind him because ALL OF US who have been watching and following him on the pitch and off it KNOW that he is genuinely NOT a bad person. He doesn't deserve to be castigated as some nasty, irredeemable cretin.

This doesn't mean we have to keep him at all costs. His actions DO hurt the club, and there is a reasonable argument to selling him off because of how his antics keep him from playing for us. But don't turn this into an issue where Suarez must be sold because he is an utterly evil, nasty person just because he lost his head and bit people three times.

So you have no evidence to support the baseless allegation that I'm a liar and/or a ""troll"" (the word you're actually looking for would be ""shill"").

To me, it looks a lot like you post just enough other links to hide your spammy nature. Hey, it's enough to keep you the right side of Reddit's banhammer, but it doesn't justify your actions and people calling you out on it is a good thing.

&gt;it is the fact that someone has been able to expose them for posing as ordinary individuals but when you read their opinions they are too sophisticated..

Again, please point out in my submission or comment history where I have posted financial opinions which are - as you suggest - sophisticated to a professional level. Nope, you can't.

And to imply that *everyone* in the UK or any subreddit has a low level of financial literacy because the *average* person isn't an expert is a fallacy of such laughable proportions that I'm beginning to think you're actually a troll (&lt;-- correct usage, look it up) and are just playing for 'teh lulz' as the kids say.

If someone who works in finance or has ""sophisticated"" knowledge of the field comments and dares to disagree with you, that doesn't make them a paid shill - another logical fallacy on your part.

You write poorly (seriously, hit 'enter' twice for a new paragraph) and you rely on fallacies to create specious, paranoid arguments. 

Take (edit: *out*) the issue of whether or not anyone is paid by other sites to suppress you and answer the direct question:  
Why should anyone put *any* trust in the advice you give? 

You keep saying that I'm a troll (when you mean shill) and am giving people financial advice or trying to direct people to websites, yet you have still not found even the slightest hint of evidence to support that ridiculous assertion. 

I have nothing to declare. I'm a professional musician with an interest in frugality and personal finance because my job has a variable income. I have worked in other areas however none of them have been in the financial field, and I don't go in for promoting websites...I leave that to *infra dig* little spam boys like your 'good' self.

You run a blog and have a vested interest in getting people to visit it. 

If you're so keen on transparency, perhaps you should declare your connection to the site in every post that you make.

&gt;The __Westboro Baptist Church__ (__WBC__) is an American unaffiliated [Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist) church known for its extreme ideologies, especially those [against gay people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia).   The church is widely described as a [hate group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group)  and is monitored as such by the [Anti-Defamation League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League) and [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center). It was headed by [Fred Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Phelps) (although shortly before his death in March 2014, church representatives said that the church had not had a defined leader in ""a very long time""),  and consists primarily of members of his extended family;  in 2011, the church stated that it had about 40 members.  The church is headquartered in a residential neighborhood on the west side of [Topeka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka) about three miles (5 km) west of the [Kansas State Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Capitol). Its first [public service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_service) was held on the afternoon of November 27, 1955.

No-one is going to be prosecuted for reporting a rape where there's insufficient evidence for a conviction. If Brooker's prosecution and sentence really will cause this sort of worry then it shows that this message hasn't got across and needs to be reinforced. 

You'd be better off focusing on a real problem. The Ministry of Justice is cutting funding for rape crisis centres. There's already a postcode lottery for rape convictions, which indicates that more resources are needed in this area, not less.

Suarez bit Ivanovic? Oh, lets give him a 10 game ban, the same ban that Pepe got when he kicked a player twice, stomped on him a few times and then punched two others. That wasn't his only incident, yet he head butts Muller of the ball and is back after just 1 game out.

Mirallas tried to break his fucking leg and gets nothing, Keane tried to end someones career and got 3 matches. To get this kind of ban you need to intentionally beat the fucking shit out of someone and send them to hospital. 

There is absolutely nothing to justify this severe a punishment, I mean disregarding the length which is probably twice as long as it should be, it also prevents him from playing for his club AND he can't even fucking train either.

This is an absolutely ridiculous punishment given his actions, I suggest that you look into other challenges that have resulted in suspension, and you will see the clear difference.

This has nothing to do with the fact that he bit a player, it has nothing to do with him being a repeat offender, this kind of punishment is heavily influenced by Italy and England wanting something out of this WC because they can't play for shit, this is heavily influenced by the Qatar and FIFA wanting to look like they are doing something, and its heavily influenced by the fact that its Suarez.

Furthermore, if the status quo cannot handle criticism then it has very serious problems. Free criticism of any and all knowledge is the only path to an enlightened society.

Young people challenge the basic assumptions of society, this is their role in the evolving complex system; and its a really important role, far more important than people realise.
If you're older, your belief structure leads you to challenge any assumptions less and less.
In effect, as you age you become more rational with respect to your set of assumptions, but far less rational in the respect that your assumptions refuse to be challenged.

&gt;Trainee barrister jailed for false rape claims

&gt;Brooker's former partner Paul Fensome, a railway signalman, was held behind bars for 37 days after she accused him of a string of rapes and assaults. While in custody, Fensome was held in a secure wing after rumours went around that he was a paedophile.

However, it was all lies

&gt;Alibis, evidence from Fensome's phone and his work shift patterns undermined Brooker's accounts. Injuries were judged to have been self-inflicted

&gt;Brooker initially told police she had made false accusations. But when she was charged with perverting the course of justice she retracted her confession.

&gt;the judge Julian Lambert said she had acted in an ""utterly wicked"" way

But... I'm sure she had good reason for such false claims? Perhaps he had previously beaten her? Boiled her kittens alive? Threatened to murder her and her family? Oh wait.

&gt;she had lied to cover up for poor performance in her barrister training

And what do the feminists have to say in response to this crime against an innocent person?

&gt; There were cries of ""Shame"" and ""Miscarriage of justice"" as Brooker's sentence was handed down.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the modern face of feminism.

true,bubbbu,null,null,"&gt;For their system to even store the password in a reversible format is completely inexcusable

It actually annoys me how widespread this belief is, there are a number of very good reasons to use plain text passwords.

1: You can use them on phone systems, very important for public bodies who need to make their systems accessible as possible. Easier to read out to a phone operator that the password is ""Chunky Monkey"" who can compare it to the password then to spend 15 minutes trying to spell out to the phone operator that it's ""ChUnky_m0Nkey""

2: plain text gives users protection against phishing and malware. You're far far more likely to have your banking details stolen because you've a keylogger or are the victim of a MITM attack than for a bank to be hacked (and if your bank account is hacked, frankly the password is the least of your worries). You cannot do ""third sixth and 8th letters of your password"" checks with a hashed password.

Hashing is a last resort level of protection, with a large enough database of users, it's well worth a hacker's time to build up a rainbow table, even for one with a good salting algorithm. Hashing is not universally the best or safest way of ensuring passwords aren't compromised.

Also, use a different password for each site/service. If you can't be bothered to use a password service/app, just do something basic like adding the first 2-3 letters of the website you're on to the start or end of your normal password. Easy to remember, makes your password far far more difficult to crack and if it is compromised, it's only compromised for one site.",0,1403871058,null,0,1403871248,0,ciif7p1,t3_2965oc,t1_ciif7p1,t3_2965oc,null,1434427657,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I think you underestimate technological progress, this is just a sample of the stories relating to battery development from 2014.

And regarding electric passenger planes,  we will certainly see Airliners that don't require any fossil fuels in our life time.  I'm assuming you have heard of Solar Impulse (http://www.solarimpulse.com/).  That can already fly.  There was only an 11 year gap between the Wright Brothers first flight and what is generally considered the first true Airliner (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner) and 65 years for the first Boeing 747.  And that was when technological progress was happening at a slower pace.

Now people are living longer and longer and tech progress is getting faster and faster.

How about you prove that I am lying? As the one who makes the claim, the burden of proof lies with you. Which is amusing because you categorically *are* a liar - as you lie by omission every time you don't announce your direct involvement with your site.

Whether other companies announce their involvement or not is irrelevant and a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that you *don't* do so. We're talking about you. Hold yourself to a higher standard.

As you've answered none of my questions, then your comment about ""could not reply back to my arguments"" is yet another example of your foolishness.

I don't believe I 'know all' or that 'others are idiots', as demonstrated by my comments further up this increasingly tedious thread. I fear you may be projecting again.

Your posts might also benefit from a little more proof-reading before posting - but you stick to your rant-y, nonsensical guns if you like. You're jolly amusing.

Not because of anything to do with the club, as he'll definitely feel the support of Liverpool through their lawyers, etc. during the ongoing discussions. But this will prove to him beyond doubt that the British Media is back to fucking with him. Partially because of him being the antithesis of everything British - against their higher moral stands and pointless politeness. 

&gt; *The striker's role is made for a hero, the defenders are supposed to be villains! Don't you know that's how they intended the game be played when they invented it! 
&gt; Thank God for Suarez! We finally get to use exclamation marks and mean it! Glory be to the gentlemen will cool names like Wayne!* 

Fucking hell. They directly voiced support for that 24 game - 2 year complete ban. God, thousands of upvotes on comment boards saying he should be put in Jail. Even in a decent paper like Guardian, [half think his ban was lienient](http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/poll/2014/jun/26/luis-suarez-bite-world-cup-2014-giorgio-chiellini). Why spend precious words making another column rationalising Chiellini, Fred and every other footballer's support for him when Brits Andy Murray and Stan ""I only beat her once"" Collymore have spoken?

Let's just conveniently forget it was originally a barbarian's game without any real rules - a real battleground. And it matters to him like it is one, like the [excellent article by Wright Thompson](http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10984370/portrait-serial-winner-luis-suarez-soccer-most-beautiful-player) shows would be obvious for a kid growing up as a street sweeper, The article is not actually about Uruguay spoiling him by indulgence [as Daniel Taylor suggests](http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/25/luis-suarez-giorgio-chiellini-violence-deceit). That's the problem with presenting opinion like a black and white fact.

 I will always love him on the field. Someone carrying the expectations of millions - club or country - SHOULD treat it like he's wants it as much as they all do combined. Even without that, for tens of thousands of pounds a week you're supposed to want to fight to death for the win - I know every serious moneytripper does.

You will encounter people like him regularly if you try and explain why circumcision is morally reprehensible and why there is a double standard.

For what it's worth (not much I would imagine), I agree with you. Circumcision is a consent issue, for a non-essential medical procedure that removes part of the genitals. Adults can decide whether or not to do it, but it should not be performed on children. The best argument for it is that it 'reduces' the chance of getting STIs, but to be honest if your concern as a parent is that your week old baby boy is going to catch an STI, there are bigger problems for you to deal with first. It's just not a good case.

On the specific subject of FGM, there are similarities and there are differences to male circumcision. I am guilty of trying to bring circumcision into any discussion on FGM, in the past. But the point I've always made is that the issue is the wishes of the victim are not being taken into account, rather than the result of the procedure or the procedure itself. 

If an adult wants to cut up their penis, or their vagina, go ahead. But as long as it's what *they* want to do, and not what *someone else* wants them to do. That is the crux of the issue, whether or not it's FGM or circumcision. Which is a point that I think is lost on a lot of people.

That's without considering the tens (hundreds?) of other overt and covert military operations, security services actions, etc. which have been used to support the status quo or indulge realpolitik (including some hideously brutal dictators and regimes) around the world.  Just to quote a couple - Anglo-American support put Suharto in place in Indonesia who proceeded to kill more than a million of his countrymen and women; Western involvement in Indochina killed several million, and destabilised the region to such an extent that it brought the brutal KR to power who killed several million more.  Not content with that, the West continued to support and succour the KR politically, materially and militarily - even _after_ they knew the atrocities they had committed - in a disgustingly brazen act of vengeance - keeping them in power and extending the horrors they were able to carry out far beyond what otherwise would have been the case.  So that's at least a third of what Stalin did in three individual incidents, and, as I say, there are many many others...

It seems the things he revealed, things he had direct knowledge of at mi5, were relatively mundane, but has continued along some general conspiracy theorist track revealing only things which are common speculations in that community?

I expected more, from what you said. I agree with you that less than discreet surveillance can be exerted on a person as a weapon, and he directly betrayed a contract with the secret services, i'd expect that to happen to him, i'm surprised he didn't go abroad after his sentence. I agree its a desirable outcome for mi5 he went mad, but remains *convenient*, not some ""*magic~*"" they weaved.

&gt; But there's no more effective way to derail a speculative line of enquiry which, perhaps even accidentally, stumbles on to a dangerous track, than to introduce some initially plausible, but ultimately embarrassing investigators, theories or 'facts'.

Whose line of enquiry? The greater conspiracy theorist communities? Or a specific one? Specifically the 9/11 truthers? I dont see how engineering this guy Shayler (how?) to join in a discussion and then lose his mind would impact such a *big* movement, at all.

true,grogleberry,null,null,"&gt;This is modern football not the old days where people threw bananas on to the pitch or broke each others legs.

How far back would you like to go? How about Wednesday? Like when Sakho violently swung an elbow at an Ecuadorian player? Or Giroud? Is it ok because they only did it once?

If that's the case, then where's Pepe's extended international ban for repeated getting sent off for violent offences?

The only thing different about Suarez is that there's more novelty in biting people than elbowing them, choking them, punching them or breaking their legs and he's higher profile.

&gt;You're just an apologist and shows what's wrong with a lot of football fans in this day and age.

I explicitly stated that he should've had a ban. I don't even have a problem with the severity, per se.

What I have a problem with is the insane over the top reaction like yours by people who've lost all sense of perspective.

You're condemning him based on the delusion that Liverpool are morally superiour to other clubs that you hold so you can feel better than other fans.

We're not and Suarez sins aren't even the worst of those currently at the club, never mind looking back through our history.

&gt;I love Liverpool and always want to see them do well but not at the expense of what's right.

I have no problem with your love of Liverpool or your hatred of Suarez.

I have a problem with the hysteria, the hypocrisy and the complete loss of perspective.

You seem to be looking for morality in a sport that gains a good proportion of it's revenue by leeching money from the working class to put a bunch of young lads who kick a bag of air around in Ferraris.

You're supporting a club that bought up property around Anfield and allowed the area to decay to force people living there to leave so they could build a new stadium.

You're supporting a club who's shirt sponsor was convicted of laundering billions of dollars of Iranian money in contravention of international law.

And you're worried that *Suarez* is sullying our good name?

&gt;When you get paid as they do you should have the expectation of professionalism, if I turned up for my job, racially abused people and bit people i'd get fired... why is it not the same for footballers... what makes them so special that they should be treated so differently?

The racial abuse was, of course, proven in a court of law. Oh no, hang on, the FA just decided it was the case.

And if you believe the FA verdict then that should've been all you needed to make your mind up anyway.

You'd also get fired for slide tackling them, spitting on the floor or always wearing a football kit into work. Football isn't just another job.

&gt;People who make excuses for others bad behaviour are just as bad as the people carrying out the action.

What excuses? I want him banned.

I just want the hypocrites to take a long hard look at themselves as well.

That goes for muppets like Alan Shearer who was prone to frequent violent outbursts worse than what Suarez has done, opposition fans who've all had dirty players and our own fans, who seem to be so concerned about what everybody thinks about them that they're making up fairy stories about the club's morality to pretend Suarez is beneath us.",0,1403874254,null,0,false,0,ciig2ur,t3_295dp7,t1_ciig2ur,t1_ciif52h,null,1434428157,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Everyone - and I mean everyone, apart from you it seems - knows that when a publicly-funded organisation like the Beeb says ""we try to ensure subtitling is as accurate as possible"" the ghost-addendum is ""within our budget"".

The reason the don't hire a whole team of people like they used to is because:

* There is less money sloshing around. than in the magical time of Used To. Recession, belt-tightening, constant criticism about the BBC and threats of scrapping the license fee. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out why they aren't going to hire a whole team of people

* There is more BBC content than there used to be. Far, far more. You can't expect them to be able to subtitle all of it without a significant hike in their budget. Feel free to campaign for more BBC funding but given your cringe-worthy moaning about how you can't criticise the BBC (such iconoclast, so wow!) I can't imagine that's high on your list of priorities.

Finally if you think that the BBC occasionally having dodgy subtitles counts as ""mistreating the disabled"" then I don't know what to tell you.

Prime is credit rating. So the high street banks typically have their prime mortgage branches. C&amp;G, Halifax, Nationwide. That stuff is mostly prime. Sub-prime is when you fucked shit up and now have to suffer shitty interest rates (Platform, Mortgages PLC, (these company names are a decade old though so no idea if they're still around)). Sometimes they don't even have high-street store-fronts and are only available via intermediaries. Sometimes prime lenders do offer sub-prime-ish deals though.  
Sub prime is why we ask: Have you had any arrears, defaults, county court judgements or bankruptcies in the past? If you say ""yes"" then you're likely sub-prime.

LTV can be an indicator of prime as most sub-prime mortgages cap more like 80% or 75% LTV where Prime mortgages are more willing to lend at higher LTVs. Still, I would not have advised to go for such an LTV as you get stitched up by higher interest rates and deals.

* Why, if the monarch's influence on government is negligible, we can't divorce the office from government - if she does nothing then what's the big fuss? If she has a lot of influence then that's even more reason to scrap the monarchy.

Understandable. I'm sorry, I was a small cog in the machine that fucked the housing market through self-certification (people proving their own incomes: LOL). Now if you want more than a shed you have to mortgage to the hilt.

I wish you luck in paying it off ASAP. Also if your work enables you to gain big blocks of money (contracting, bonus, mad overtime) then check out the mortgages that allow you to overpay without tripping the ""exit penalty"" (redemption penalty). That can save a lot at the start of a mortgage.

That's a weak argument though.

Even the most extreme claims of deaths under revolution/communism (which I predictably dispute, both in terms of the raw numbers and the extent to which they were done in the name of ideals as opposed to the reaction against those ideals) are far lower than those which could be attributed to the various stages of reaction/capitalism in between.

Wales has a lot of amazing castles if you're interested in that sort of thing. Personally, I'd recommend **Manorbier castle**, near Tenby, Pembrokeshire, which is in a spectacular location and still has the castle pretty much intact. You can visit the castle, but the beach nearby is stunningly beautiful and also somewhat popular with surfers. Overall, Pembrokeshire is a lovely part of Wales and there's lots to see and do there. Plus, **the fish &amp; chips at Fecci's in Tenby are delicious**, and the Bay Tree and the Plantagenet are both decent restaurants there.

I second the Pen Y Fan recommendation of /u/stvb95. Around that area are a lot of opportunities to do things like caving, rock climbing, white water rafting, gorge scrambling etc too if that's your thing.

**Tintern Abbey** is a beautiful ruined abbey in the spectacular Wye Valley, just over the Severn Bridge from Bristol. If it's a nice day, the drive approaching there is stunning, the place itself is stunning, and you're also close to **Chepstow**, the castle of which is worth a visit.

So: If you're thinking of heading into Wales from Bristol, I'd recommend Tintern Abbey on the first day, traveling up to stay in Brecon that night, doing the brecon beacons then heading west to Pembrokeshire. Stay overnight there, you can enjoy fish &amp; chips in Tenby and go to the beach,, then visit Manorbier.

Outside of Wales, **Avebury Stone Circle** (near Marlborough in Wiltshire) is a great piece of ancient British history which I'd recommend visiting. Silbury Hill and the Long Barrow are also nearby -- they're all of real historical interest and are great to just walk around and relax too.

I genuinely recommend **the Eden Project** in Cornwall, though it's not really a hidden gem. **Tintagel**, relatively close to the Eden Project on the north Cornwall coast, has some unbelievable views and a fun historical connection to the Arthurian legend.

**Iron Bridge** and the surrounds in Shropshire are great, its sort of a living museum of the Industrial Revolution, but less lame than that sounds.

In Kent, I'd recommend **Canterbury Cathedral**, again not a hidden gem but you can spend hours visiting there, it also contains the shrine to Thomas Beckett if you fancy making a pilgrimage! Sweeps festival in Rochester is great, glad you're familiar with that.

If I think of any more, I'll come and edit. ",0,1403876533,null,0,false,1,ciigv56,t3_298get,t1_ciigv56,t3_298get,null,1435488340,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Some say he is too old for the amount of money we are spending on him. However,  looking over the next couple of years, SG will be playing less and less. 

We need some leadership to help ease that and a leader of Lallana's type in the midfield ( at his prime ) may be invaluable to the squad.

He is also used to playing a very similar style to ours and has excelled in the league.  Which, fingers crossed, means that a good pre-season and he should be able to hit the ground running for the start of the season.

Plus, even if he does not play regularly, he has an amazing off-the-pitch attitude and influence.  This is a player who has led us to the CL quarter finals.  He knows what a cohesive team looks like, and he always is trying to build it.  His concentration and hard-work are great examples for the youth.  If you watch any goal that we ever conceded with Dawson on the pitch, you'll notice that Dawson never gives up until the ball is in the back of the net, whereas Kaboul/Vert will *always* go limp and get that ""fuck it"" look on their face after the goal seems inevitable.  
  
Caulker put it very well when he said that, in retrospect, he (Caulker) should have fought for a place in the team the way Dawson did rather than start looking around for other clubs.

I still don't understand how that was ever allowed to happen.

I'm allowed to pay off 10% of the mortgage each year in overpayments with no fee. I'll never hit 10% a year, so that's fine by me.

It's a decent reference guide. I just looked at it about 20 minutes ago to check the exact % I'm getting. 

I managed 4.49%. Originally it was going to be 3.79% but we went through all the application, fees, etc and then they came back and said 'Sorry. Don't offer mortgages on ex-council houses.'

Me neither. I personally think its the strongest single reason for the spike in property over a decade ago. Such foolishness.

&gt; I'm allowed to pay off 10% of the mortgage each year in overpayments with no fee.

Ye, this is a reasonably recent development (past decade) and I really like that now a lot of mortgages come with this built in.

&gt; I managed 4.49%. Originally it was going to be 3.79% but we went through all the application, fees, etc and then they came back and said 'Sorry. Don't offer mortgages on ex-council houses.'

Yeah this is kinda why the remortgaging system sucks. Its the fees that end up being the killer in my own personal opinion (for reasons of 'entrapment' due to Application Fees as well as people just mindlessly adding them to the mortgage) and all the silly exceptions that you never see in the small print (ex-council houses are killer for this sort of shit). Was the adviser a proper independent? I think that's either a B or C as opposed to A (a lender's mortgage adviser) in one of the first few parts of the KFI.  
I bet he tried to sell his own insurance as well, although to be fair the insurances the lenders generally offer suck.

&gt; It's a decent reference guide. 

Glad to hear that. It was one of the big changes that I helped mortgage companies integrate back in 2004 when I worked in the industry.

I'm not sure to be honest. Then again, it's just about impossible to say.

IMO, had they not sold Bale, they wouldn't have bought all those players they did, especially not in that position. That means no Eriksen and Lamela, for starters. Other than Eriksen, all their other signings were crap anyway. I think without selling Bale they might've got players like Chadli and Capoue and still been where they ended up ultimately.

My best mate is a Spurs fan and admitted last year something I'd been telling him for 2 years...that Bale papered over **massive** cracks for them. I don't think Spurs were good enough for a CL spot with or without Bale, but then again, it's all conjecture like I said.

With regards to headbutts, yeah its violent conduct and should be treated harshly, but thats just the governing bodies inconsistency with handing out punishments for violent conduct.  If Pepe did that in a league game then he'd probably get a 3 match ban, which is what I thought he should have gotten here. 

But you cant just whack together all violent incidents into the same bracket. If you slap someone across the head, you'd expect that they are going to get a smaller length of ban than headbutting someone, but suspensions will probably stay the same, or increase by a couple games (and fines) for repeat offences over their career.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"No. We shouldn't adapt our formation and playing style because of one player's absence. We should sign new players.

We needed new attacking players anyway.

Last season, we copes with Suarez's suspension, because Sturridge was awesome. However, although we mostly managed to cope when Studge was out, over Xmas and in the run-in, you could argue that he was missing for the games where we lost the league. 

Even so, we were **lucky** that they were never both out at the same time. To start a new season without Suarez and just hope that Studge stays fit would just be reckless.

To be fair, though, we knew we needed more players:

* as said, we were lucky with injuries and suspensions last year, although some might argue that they still cost us the title.
* we will have more games to play this year. Our current squad can't handle 2 games a week.
* it was obvious at times that Brendan didn't have a game changing option from the bench. Another player of the quality of Suarez, Sturridge or Sterling (a Konoplyanka, Willian, Christiensen or Mkhyrtn (sp?) for example) would have turned some draws into wins, but we had Aspas and Moses.
* if you're not trying to improve your squad, you're stagnating and you can bet your competitors won't be so complacent.

So we needed 2–3 attacking players of the same sort of quality as Suarez, Sturridge or Sterling *anyway*.

What's changed is that we need them in before the start of the season, and we need at least a couple of them to be proven in a Rodgers-like system and/or in the Premier League.

I think those of us who cooled on Lallana should be taking another look now:

* knows the Premier League.
* knows the pressing-with-emphasis-on-transitions style.
* knows Rickie Lambert really well,
* knows Gerradrd, Hendo, Studge and Sterling at least somewhat well

but having said that, he mustn't be our marquee signing of the year. Lallana will increase the depth of the squad whilst *maintaining* the high quality. He won't really improve the squad in the sense of bringing quality that wasn't previously there. We need more.

In terms of the formation, I think we're looking at the same decision re: 1 up vs 2 up that Rodgers was making before. If he was going to use 2 strikers, it's going to be Studge + Lambert / A.N.Other. If he was going to ask Suarez to play in a little behind, say against a back 3 or if an extra man is needed in midfield, we're looking at a new signing in that role. And I think more often than not, we're looking at the former situation.",0,1403878111,null,0,false,0,ciihgo0,t3_298hqz,t1_ciihgo0,t3_298hqz,null,1434428565,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

There is no way around that. Unless of course you are going to say that the left do NOT want to increase immigration, which is outright false. Or that we can somehow allow hundreds of thousands of immigrants to come here every year and NEVER have to build any more houses.

true,offord94,lfc99,,"Possibly, but I still think the positive impact Suarez has outweighs the benefits all those players coming in would have. The new signings would have to gel and take time to adapt before they reached their full promise. Obviously, they would still be more effective than a player sitting out fo 13 or so games but at least when Suarez returned we would know we could rely on his quality. With the exception of Sanchez we really don't know if these players are quality. I think I'd rather rely on Sterling, Coutniho, Sturridge, Lambert and maybe one addition with the knowledge that Suarez will be back than all of these new unproven players. 

Additionally, remember Suarez has been captain for the club before and you can see how he has helped mentor the younger players (paticularly Sterling). He is an incredibly important part of the infrastructure of the team.

I understand your point about him ageing and showing signs of fatigue, but that's partly because he hasn't had a full Summer off since 2009. In the following Summers he has had; 2010 World Cup, 2011 Cope America, 2012 Olympics, 2013 Confederations Cup and then the World Cup this year. That's bound to take a toll as he doesn't get as much rest as a lot of other players (on top of all the travelling). You could aruge that last year his ban extending 6 games into the season affected him, but it's not like he wasn't training. If he can't train with us anyway, and won't be available until late October, he could take an extended break and then begin training on his own (in contact with the club if that's allowed) around late August/ September so he can get up to match fitness but finally gets some rest and possibly comes back the freshest he's been for years in November.

I do think that signing Morena, Sanchez, Shaqiri and Can (and Lallana as well it looks like) would still make us a good team, but Tottenham's unravellnig after they sold Bale last year and re-made their team has me concerned. Even if things went well, I can't help but feel I would spend the majority of the season enjoying the team aand new signings, but still wondering about Suarez, and knowing he is better than any player we have on the team.",0,1403879203,null,0,false,0,ciihwiq,t3_298l90,t1_ciihwiq,t1_ciihega,null,1434428772,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

To me throwing an arm back is something anyone could do by lashing out in the heat of the moment, without much if any thought behind it.

Anyone doing the kind of investigative journalism that very rarely gets done by the corporate media any more.

&gt;The greater conspiracy theorist communities? Or a specific one? Specifically the 9/11 truthers?

Why are we suddenly talking about 9/11?  Just because it's a conspiracy theory, or because Shayler has spoken on it, or because there are some particularly wacky ones, or what?  As it goes, I'd put odds on the chance of some of those last being put out there by the authorities to discredit more mainstream criticism of the event itself, the governmental response, the investigation, cover ups, etc., but I've no hard evidence for that.

&gt;I dont see how engineering this guy Shayler (how?) to join in a discussion and then lose his mind would impact such a big movement, at all.

Well, the fact that you view his initial revelations as pedestrian could suggest that it was a set up from the outset, but I'm not convinced of that - I don't know anyone who knows him, but it'd be a fairly demanding act to live as mentally ill as a full time job, although I also don't know the extent to which he's subsequently made a recovery, or continues to manifest positive symptoms of psychosis, nor how regularly.  Having said that, people have done it for extended periods for academic research, (method) acting roles and possibly as undercover operatives.

As you say, it may well be that it was just a bit of convenient serendipity for the security services.  Those undoubtedly happen, and more often than people imagine ([people are generally really bad about the probability of coincidence](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4542341)).  Then again, it's just as bad to be a pig-headed coincidence theorist as to be a pig-headed conspiracy theorist.  Conspiracies happen all the time, and they can become very large without being exposed, even though they often leak like sieves, because of all sorts of complicity and collaboration by media, and a certain amount of willful blindness and belief in comforting fairy tales on the part of their readerships.

First, apparently I need to remind you that Suarez bit three players while in uniform and on the field for his club or country.  John Terry is not banging Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend at the edge of the penalty area.

Second, to be perfectly frank, I don't follow the personal lives of soccer players and I don't read tabloids but I don't think any of the alleged affairs have been substantiated.  If you want to talk gossip then you can do that at the nail salon.

Third, and related to the second, I don't care about players' personal lives provided they play honest soccer.  If Suarez wants to bite people in his spare time sure that's not really a concern of mine, but keep it off the field.

Fourth, with regards to Terry being a racist - he was cleared of criminal charges in that matter but charged by the FA which has a much lower burden of proof and a far greater incentive to issue punishment to JT.  Of course I am not saying that it is impossible he made racists remarks (and in that instance it would be shameful) but it was again never proven.  While we are at it, wasn't Suarez also charged and found guilty of making racist remarks?

So what does that leave us with?  ""Drogba has done countless things""?  Please name *one* that is even remotely akin to biting someone because I am positive that you cannot.

A lot of previously flippant and unpolitical american ""kids"" became rapidly politicized by the Vietnam war and in particular to their almost unified opposition to conscription. In the elections that followed they really proved decisive in tipping the balance of US foreign and domestic policy, because policymakers realized there was more political capital to be had in embracing them than it trying to silence them... being ""anti-war"" won votes, and infact even today it still does in the US.

I think he's a good player don't get me wrong but he is not and will never be anything near a world beater which is a mistake IMO because in our position we should be buying players who could reach that level ie. Can.

Pros to buying Lallana;

He's a captain

He's been successful in the league with a team with a similar-ish style to ourselves

He's obviously talented and will likely play better in a better team

He can score and assist a fair amount of goals which we need

He can dribble

He covers a shitloads of ground (similar to hendo)

Cons

He's 26

He's expensive which puts more pressure on a player

He's only had one stand out year in the premier league

His ceiling has probably been reached or close to it and that ceiling 
isn't jaw dropping

He's not very fast

I personally think he's overrated (sorry Adam I'll love you soon)

Having said all this when if he puts on that jersey he's one of us and I will give him all the support in the world and the full benefit of the doubt until he proves otherwise.

Rodgers has the tendency of getting the very best out of players (Hendo, Sterling, Sturridge). Lallana is versatile and was a gem in a decent Southampton side. Imagine him with players surrounding him that he can provide and assist.

Too many people poo-pooing him. Considering Southampton wanted £30mil and now £25mil, I'm still excited asf.

For all we know, Suarez could be going to Barca and we've got more money to spend than the fans know. I'm still expecting Sanchez to show up and crossing my fingers for Shaqiri to.

What a fucking team we'd have with Sanchez/Lallana/Shaqiri/Sturridge/Hendo/Sterling/Coutinho/Gerrard all as depth. This allows us to rest Gerrard more, as Hendo and Lallana can cover more ground.

Now from what I can find looking quickly online the 8th had around 350,000 operational aircrew, new stuff said 26,000 KIA so we'll use that, means that the 8th had a death rate of around 7.5%. So from percentages USAF was safer than bomber command. 

The other factors you're talking about are not needed when drawing up a comparison of KIA airmen. Bomber command didn't just utilise Lancaster's that's just the most famous, same for the B 17 (B 52 is the big ass cold war plane that's still in service.) For the record a B 17 crew compliment is 10, a Lancaster is 7. 

If we look at the percentages I am still right. Bomber commands casualty rate was insane, 8,500 wounded, 9,800 captured. Lets add everything together, all casualties/losses of bomber command comes to around 73,300. That is a casualty rate of around 59%, which is insane, the sacrifice of Bomber command is one of the most underplayed thing of the war. If you want to work out the US casualty rate if they'd been fighting for as long as we were please try it would be interesting to see.

Because according to wikipedia, it was a big contribution, or a big interest of his. I see google make more recent reference to typical conspiracy fare implying CIA agitation created the Ukraine uprising. General stuff. I didnt dig into him, so thats why im not talking about anything else.

&gt; because Shayler has spoken on it

Exactly that. If you wish to elaborate on what his major contribution to the conspiracy community was, and his lines of inquiry dangerous enough to the establishment that the security services would weave their *magic~* and drive him insane (how?) then please do, otherwise bringing him up falls apart in its relevance.

I see a lot of ""because *this happened* then all *this* is happening"" and it doesn't follow. So when i ask for clarification, please dont evade it.

&gt; Well, the fact that you view his initial revelations as pedestrian

I do indeed, Lockerbie means MI6 would be invested in taking out Qaddafi. That there was a blunder in preventing a terrorist attack is also pretty mundane.

&gt; it'd be a fairly demanding act to live as mentally ill as a full time job

LOL. We're so far off track here its absurd. We've gone from ""what exactly was he discrediting to make it worth attacking him"" to pantomime psychosis as a mi5 tactic. Enjoy yourself with that.

Back to the point, you said some conspiracy theories are probably planted to discredit the conspiracy theorist community as a whole, you brought up speculation about Shayler to support that.

I think that community is doing fine by itself being crackpot, so such intervention is unlikely. Now attacking an entity such as Anonymous, you can see how introducing noise:signal with tinfoil material and supporting the crackpots and most aggressive types, while discrediting moderates and ""shills"" to destabilise the entity would be the use of deploying conspiracy theories as a component tactic in a greater strategy.

But it doesn't follow that the conspiracy theory community would be a credible and threatening target worthy of (a necessarily vast amount of) attention from the security services. Not only is that a delusion of grandeur on its part to speculate so, it would be comparatively expensive compared to attacking it, or specifically any threatening lines of inquiry, from the outside, with contradictory media and smears.

&gt; Conspiracies happen all the time, and they can become very large without being exposed

And covert conspiracies dont show evidence. I'm not disputing the premise of the conspiracy theory, just the idea you put forward that the security services are attacking the greater conspiracy theory community with bogus and ridiculous theories.

Their work is more likely to be lifted copy and paste as a weapon for disruption within specific circles they want to attack.

true,ChunkyCodLoins,null,null,"I went to Trent (though bear in mind this was a while back as I graduated in '98). As others have mentioned, how the uni is viewed (or if you even care about that) depends on what you're planning on studying and the kind of people you're wanting to work for afterwards. I've never been aware of anyone giving a rat's arse which uni I went to, but then I work in a technical discipline and don't tend to come across snobby people (if you're an employer who cares about where people were educated and not what they can do, then you're a snob). Trent has two main campuses; one in the city centre, and one a bit out of town in an area called Clifton. Where you'd be based would be dependent on what you're studying.

My time at Trent was ace, but then it's the only uni I've been to so have little else to compare it to as an institution. However, since doing my degree I've lived in Manchester (twice), London, Leeds, and I can tell you Nottingham, to my mind, is the best city by a stretch. That's why I'm still living here now, more than 20 years since I first moved here, have bought a house and have no plans of leaving. Here are my main reasons why. 

1. It's not too big - I have to disagree with /u/fz6greg when he says it's a sprawling city. Compared to Birmingham, London, Manchester etc it's not sprawling at all, and has a nice critical mass. Nowhere in the city is more than a 25 minute bus journey from the city centre. I live in the north of the city and it's less than 4 miles to visit my mates who live on the south side of the River Trent or go to the football (soccer). This leads me onto ....

2. There's lots of 'stuff' here - as the article linked to by /u/awesome_5000 shows, we have a vibrant arts and music scene and by God we are well served for good pubs. We have several theatres showing a whole range of things from international shows, ballets, operas, orchestras to amateur dramatics. We have a stadium where international artists play (I went to see Elton John earlier this week), as well as little funky places that play jazz, open mic stuff, indie, SKA, hip-hop. We have Rock City, and pretty much everyone's played there. There are also a few music festivals, as well as outside theatrical and operatic performances in the summer. We have two football teams, a decent rugby team, an excellent ice hockey team and a very good roller-derby team. There's an international tennis tournament every year (and a wheelchair tennis tournament), A national cycling race, the national water-sports centre is here as well. That's a lot of 'stuff' in a city this size with a population of around a third of a million.

3. Mix of people - You asked about this, so I'll address it specifically. I've never lived anywhere with a closer level of community consisting of such a vast array of colours, creeds, religions, outlooks and lifestyles. We are rightly proud of our diversity, and local government make a big deal of the events put on for specific communities and sharing those events with everyone. Differing communities are encourages to interact and use the city as one, and that's what we do. As has been mentioned several times, the city has two (permanent) universities. On top of this there is an Open University campus (for remote learning) and a number of large colleges. Therefore there's no shortage of interesting people around with time and imagination on their side. Pretty much whatever you're into, I think you'll find like-minded people here.

Like any city in the world there are bits that aren't as nice, and there's a certain level of crime. That's to be expected, but I've never had a problem and by no means do I live in a posh bit of town. Like most places, if you're not an idiot and don't go looking for trouble then you won't find it.

I hope this has given you a feel for what the place is like. Sorry if I've banged on a bit. If you have any more questions we'll be happy to answer.",0,1403883560,null,0,false,0,ciiju7a,t3_297ypc,t1_ciiju7a,t3_297ypc,null,1434429690,2,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,2

I mean, at least he could have headbutted someone, jumped into a tackle studs up, or kicked them in the head. Those would have been SO much better. When Pepe ""lost his mind"" in 2009 and repeated kicked, kneed, pushed Casquero's face into the ground, then continued to stomp on him, he got a 10 match ban.

This is a fantastic example of the assumption bias I talk about above. You're making a generalisation and you will ignore any evidence about young people that doesn't fit this view. I've met stoner activists, people that know something is wrong but don't know anything about it 

&gt; At that point they might learn something about economics and put effort into affecting policy in a realistic and actual way.

You seem to think that older people are more rational and young people are less rational. Really, everybody is irrational. Older people have had more time to develop a logically consistent set of ideas, but this is based on confirming a set of assumptions that necessarily incomplete. Young people seem less rational because the underlying assumptions have had less time to form, yet this is a massive and brilliant advantage because they have the capability of challenging the status quo.
Society improves not by gradual change, but through a series of revolutionary shifts in technology and perception of the world.

The reactionary mentality is to fight the change, to insult those that propose the change and to think yourself better for accepting a set of assumptions.

I hated having to sign on before filling out the forms but being berated every week was painful, no one is proud to claim, some don't care that they have to claim but none is actively proud that they have to claim off the government. Why treat the poor and needy like turds? Just pay up, stop griping and accept some people are unfortunate, focus on finding them work. If someone is late once do not punish them but explain what will happen in future. 

They really don't care why you're poor and in need of help they just want to see evidence of job searches and to make sure your punctual, if they really cared about finding you work they would help you get on courses immediately not wait for you to be claiming for a solid 6 months.

I don't think you understand why the media outcry is so big. Regardless of what Pepe did, countless other players have done throughout their time in football. I could point to Totti's two disastrous stamps as an example (Ramelow and Balotelli) clearly much more dangerous than a bite - a bite is seen as a complete anomaly. 

I've been stamped on and head butted playing football before. Of course I'm not happy about it but it's generally some part of the game. If someone tried to bite me in a game Idk how i would react. 

Pepe's a dirty defender yes, but we've seen TONS of dirty defenders, I'm not saying it makes it right at all but cheap shots are a part of every sport. We see it all the time, it's not like Pepe is the first person to ever make a tough tackle, stamp on a player or start a fight on the field. 

Also where did I try to defend ALL of pepe's actions either? I said his headbutt against muller was stupid and not dangerous - I didnt say everything he has ever done is excusable - don't put words into my month. 

But Onswer me this then, why is there more of an outcry for Suarez biting people three times and not Totti stamping and blatantly kicking people (much more dangerous)? Do you think it's some kind of vendetta against Suarez? Or Is it legitimately insane that he keeps going around biting players on the pitch which is completely unprecedented in world football.

It's not about the severity of the act - its much more about the depravity and sheer insanity of it. Not to mention it's his third time doing the exact same thing after being punished severely for it. I know you are harping on the fact that players do ""different acts"" and aren't punished as harshly because of the variance. But let's be realistic, we are humans, seeing someone do the same thing over and over again while being punished over and over again has a different effect.

If pepe went and kicked someone like Casquero again at the WORLD CUP mind you, obviously he would be banned for a long time. There's a huge difference between him kicking out as Casquero and the ""light"" headbutt vs Muller - don't you think? Or are they all the same to you?

Suarez apparently doesn't learn and/or needs help, it's shocking really after the Ivanovic one.

My point being that he is a repeat offender of far more dangerous acts. One of the main points of this whole debacle is that he bit someone 3 times. I think that is false logic. What if he punched someone, then kicked someone, then elbowed someone and broke their skulls. Id bet a lot he wouldnt be punished this severely. 

I agree, Pepe isn't the only player to do these things. My anger stems from my belief that Suarez's ban is SO out of proportion to his actions that it doesn't stand to reason. What logic is there to reacting worse to strange or bizarre incidents instead of dangerous ones? Depravity? Really. Depravity is kicking a man multiple times while he is on the ground. Biting shoulders is not ""depravity"" or ""insanity"". 

And yes, I completely understand that the public can generate much more outrage by repeated incidents. But the punishment screams to me that FIFA has penalized based on public opinion. Mob rule is not something to placate. If the US legal system worked on that basis, Obama would have been deported in 2008 for being an illegal Kenyan immigrant. 

I'll concede that the light headbutt didnt warrant a harsh punishment, but it is a repeated issue with him. So much of the wrath against Suarez is that ""he isn't learning"", yet other far more violent acts ( I wont include Pepe-Muller) committed by many players are brushed aside as part of the game. I think this sends the wrong message. FIFA does not care about player safety or the spirit of the game. They care about appearing to weird a legitimacy they have long ago lost. 

Suarez does need help and he seriously needs to reevaluate his mental status in games. But a 4 month global ban is absurd. I think the fact that they have not mandated counseling shows just how little they care about the actual act, or the player, and how they only cared about acting tough and making a statement.I would say a 10 match international ban, and 1-2 months months global ban. NOT excluding him from training with his teammates. What the hell is that even about? They are just trying to ruin his life, not make him serve the consequences for biting. Even Chiellini has said it was excessive.

On top of all of this though, the vilification of Suarez is just a continuation of what he faces every week in the English media. Maybe you dont follow the EPL much, but Suarez is one of the most targeted and sensationalized players in England. You would think he was trying to end careers by the global hate he has received.

I don't think that means what you think it means. The Crown Estate was granted to the state in return for a stipend for the royal family in perpetuity. If that contract were to be broken said property would not belong to the state but would revert to the royal family. 

&gt; The most-visited country in the world is France. The most-visited palaces in the world are Versailles and the Louvre, because the French did something that would actually increase tourism – they turned them into museums.

Buckingham Palace is open to the public. Do you think it would get as many visitors as Versailles if the Queen relocated elsewhere and it was turned into a museum? It's open to the public now as a functioning home of the Head of State and it doesn't.

Nor am I, I'm talking about how we got to where we are now and the influence the royals have had on getting us to this point.

British democracy has been a model to the world for a very long time stemming from Magna Carta and including the break from Rome. We know have a unique and fascinating system that not only works effectively in the modern world but is an example across the Commonwealth and beyond. 

&gt; Why, then, has the momentum been away from monarchy and towards republican democracy around the world, for the past century?

I seriously think a degree from the OU is just as good on paper however there are a fair few advantages to going to university properly.

1) It's a fucking awesome life changing experience that will make you a better person not just more knowledgable but also more social and open to new ideas.

2) You will be finished a lot quicker. Seriously 6 years? You could lost interest before that happens.

3) It will be easier. Seriously I have to study after work still to achieve a job promotion and it's beyond a pain. University was far easier because when your job is to study. You will study. Especially as you are used to going to work everyday anyway.

4) You are generally at uni from the middle of September to early June. That's at least 3 months of the year you an go back to working full time. I never had a problem finding temporary admin work throughout this time.

My advice would be to do an access course in the evening to allow you to get into university. Then just go! Either that or have a look if any universities offer a foundation course in what you are after. They usually take a year too and will allow you into the full degree.

true,archon88,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"&gt;If that contract were to be broken said property would not belong to the state but would revert to the royal family. 

As it stands, it's public property. A real democratic system would at least require an open consultation on its future under a republican system; transferring the ownership of public land to a single family would be regressive in the extreme, and it would merely perpetuate the anti-egalitarian nature of the British state as it stands, which is getting better and better at transferring wealth upwards. Such privatisation should never occur without public consensus; that's the sort of thing that gave Thatcher a bad name. The family already owns extensive private property, such as the Balmoral estate, which would in any case remain theirs.

&gt; Do you think it would get as many visitors as Versailles ... if it was turned into a museum?

Well, why not? Who avoids visiting Versailles because the Bourbons no longer live there?

&gt; Nor am I, I'm talking about how we got to where we are now and the influence the royals have had on getting us to this point.

My point was, you're talking about the past. One of the big problems with our culture is that we're stuck in a timewarp; there is no clear distinction between things that belong to the future and things that belong to the past.

&gt;We know have a unique and fascinating system that not only works effectively in the modern world but is an example across the Commonwealth and beyond.

We have the disintegrating vestiges of an Empire, a rather sordid history in its own right, and countries like Australia and New Zealand, which in the words of the previous Governor General of the former and the current Prime Minister of the latter, will inevitably become republics. Australia as it stands is a republic in all but name, and it has a written constitution, which for no obvious reason, we lack. We don't have a system so much as a hodgepodge of various traditions that came along and stuck during various points of our history, and there is little desire in British culture to examine these things critically. Most BBC coverage of the monarchy is the sort of one-sided propaganda you would expect to see in North Korea. Lest you imagine that things are better at home, one of the four nations (Ireland) has already left the Union (well, most of it has), and there is deep discontent with the Union in another of its members, Scotland. So maybe the ""effectiveness"" of the British system is more open to question than you make out.

You also didn't answer the question. Why is a republic less democractic than a monarchy, given that all else being equal, the former has an additional degree of democractic accountability?

&gt; Ignorance and misrepresentation of the benefits

That's absurd. Do you think Germany got rid of the Kaisers because they were ""ignorant"" of the ""benefits"" of German imperialism, or Italy got rid of Vittorio Emanuele because they were ignorant of the benefits to their country of a deeply incompetent monarch who cuddled up to Mussolini? The French Republics provided far better governance than the monarchs, Bourbon or Bonaparte, who ruled before.

&gt;There is some of that misrepresentation I was talking about. 

It is not in any sense a misrepresentation to point out that a lack of public accountability is incompatible with democracy. That's almost a matter of definition.

1. As far as I'm aware, Bristol seems like a pretty tolerant place - of course there will be the odd person with a problem but in general I'd say it's an open-minded city.
2. Definitely depends where you shop, Clifton and Whiteladies road can be very expensive for going out and shopping, but look around and you will find more reasonable places. 
3. Redland and Cotham as said before are fairly residential with some student houses so there is a bit of noise, I have always felt safe here and it is an easy walk to the centre.
4. Generally a deposit will consist of a month's rent plus an agency fee if you go through an agency. I think if you can pay the rent through any bank account then that should be fine. I currently pay £350 a month which is around average for this area, though there are cheaper areas.
5. No help here, sorry.
6. Get to know the place by walking around :-) there are lots of cool bars and cafes dotted about the place. As someone mentioned there is a huge variety of festivals and things going on within the city. The harbourside is lovely so I would recommend having a walk round there. Bristol is horrible to drive around so if you can avoid driving then do so. ",0,1403890137,null,0,false,0,ciin3ej,t3_28teha,t1_ciin3ej,t3_28teha,null,1434431364,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1

The EU parliament has 800 or so MEPs NONE of whom can propose legislation. It is up to the 28 commissioners to propose legislation that affects 500 million people.

The EU is too centralized. The argument that ""well democracy is by definition imposition"" does not mean that we should therefore celebrate more and more centralization of power.

true,Ghoul12,null,null,"&gt; The reactionary mentality is to fight the change, to insult those that propose the change

Except they're not proposing change. ""Down with government!"" has no content to it. If Russell Brand and his like came up with an actual document that detailed EXACTLY how we can do all the things he wants, then I would say that he is on the right track. But he doesn't. He doesn't actually care about any of the issues, as we can tell by his refusal to think seriously about any of them or ponder any actual solutions, he just wants to play the revolutionary. That's why his protestations remain as shrill and vapid as they have always been. All noise, no substance.

I'm sorry but you are saying that young people challenge the ""status quo"", and some of them do, but most don't. They just regurgitate whatever left-wing slosh they've been indoctrinated with at uni or sixth form. I can count on one hand the amount of young people I have met that had thought through any of the world's problems to any sort of depth.

I'm sorry but complaining about things and offering no solutions does not equate to ""challenging the status quo"". The ""status quo"" OF young people is one of blind rebellion and idealism and has been for some time. By parroting Russell Brand and Karl Marx they aren't challenging anything, they're just bleating empty nothings into the wind.

&gt;your assumptions are bound to be wrong and your rationality is simply something you cling to stop the fear that your actually living in a bureaucratic shit hole in which you're alienated from everyone through your belief that conforming to social norms will make everything better.

Who said anything about conforming to social norms? I simply stated that revolutionary Occupy types are extremely heavy on NOISE-MAKING, and offer no actual solutions or methods of change.

I have met some who do, but most don't. I find that those who actually have the knowledge to propose realistic changes are people who have a deep knowledge of history, economics, society, etc. I don't say that most older people have this either. In fact, the mentality of a ""everything is completely fine as it is"" Tory/Labourite and a ""Smash the state!"" Russell Brand type is very similar.

These are people who have no real understanding of anything, have no opinions of their own (because they don't have a deep enough understanding to even form an opinion), but simply parrot things they have picked up from left wing books and their college professors.

I am actually for radical social change and reform but don't believe that wearing a Che Geuvara t shirt and watching Bill Hicks all the while complaining about the government is going to change anything.

Nope. Unowned property reverts to the Crown.

And the current arrangement (the Estate being put into trust, with the revenue going to the Treasury and the Royals getting the Civil List) was preceded by full ownership of the land by the Royal Family. It would stand to reason, therefore, that if the Monarchy was abolished (along with this agreement) that the property would revert back to its former owner: The Royal Family.

Not by any legal right. In your opinion, sure, but your opinion doesn't mean squat. Neither does mine. What *does* mean anything, is the legal standing. The legal standing doesn't agree with you, and changing it so that it does would be a dangerous path to walk down.

&gt; How many South American nations have invaded each other in the last fifty years?

This a bit of a false equivalency in regards to the discussion at hand. Even so the answer is still more wars between them than has happened between EU members. Ecuador and Peru went to war about 20 years ago. Its also important to consider civil wars (Colombia) in the region which are largely caused by corruption the lack of proper legal structures to protect the people ala the ECHR so I wouldn't exactly say South America is a conflict free zone although large scale immigration after WW2 also probably helped to a degree there people didn't flee from war torn land just to start another, with the lack of ethnic nationalism and lack of centuries old cultural differences helping to prevent war.

&gt; How many African nations?

You've really done some mental gymnastics here trying to compare peacetime Western Europe to Africa. I take it you haven't heard of the Second Congo War with losses of around [3 million](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8471147.stm). Whilst I suppose you may have a point about direct invasions (of one sovereign state to another) being less common remember that Africa and Europe are not really comparable in this way given that the borders of Africa were largely drawn by foreigners playing divide and conquer without concern for those who actually lived there. This has caused many civil wars that have wreaked havoc on the continent. The lack of democratic and legal structures to protect the people have also played a large part in this. In the EU you aren't allowed to have dictators and you must be a signatory of the ECHR (and these things aren't optional or just for show) which has somewhat helped stabilty in EU states, that said I don't think civil war is very likely within EU states nowadays anyway but even so I guess this acts as a little extra protection against it.

On to Asia, again plenty of conflicts many along the lines of Africa a mixtures of the inevitable hangover from colonialism, numerous civil wars and a lack of democratic and legal structures to protect citizens add to that the economic interests of neighbouring states are not entwined to anywhere near the degree they are in the EU. 

&gt; Are all these continents in a pact as all-encompassing as what is present in Europe?

No and as a result so are blighted by war and conflict far more than the EU funnily enough. This whole peace in the EU isn't a coincidence you know. They were actually going for this peace thing in the first place. I would point you towards the Schumann declaration this part referring to the creation of the ECSC(forerunner to the EU) being the most telling 

""The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.""

&gt; If you find the answer to these questions, you'll find out why I am so sceptical of your claims.

You know google could have told you there have no been wars within the EU's borders compared with more than zero for the others, many in Asia and Africa. As for your xkcd it seems pretty irrelevant in the course of this discussion given I have listed a number of reasons to backup why the EU has prevented has prevented war within itself, granted they are indirect in nature but it is still pretty obvious that they have helped to some extent.

Turns out though when it came to providing evidence for their claims, they couldn't because this was just a hypothesis, and not only that....evidence carried out by actual scientists (one guy was Sacha Baron Cohen's brother) showed male and females actually naturally gravitated towards things through instinct led by hormones and their hypothesis was false. 

Anyway the whole documentary series showed feminism for the sham it is and the government was forced under pressure from the public to stop funding various feminist groups for talking bollocks because they were making shit up and presenting it as fact and the state was basing policies on it.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"The petition to review the legislation around noise complaints posted by the OP was [inspired](http://kerrymccarthy.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/the-savethefleece-campaign-goes-national/) by the efforts to save the Fleece in Bristol. My MP Kerry McCarthy (Labour, Bristol East) has become the patron of the Music Venue Trust because she's been instrumental in supporting the cause locally. 

The Fleece has been running for over thirty years as a dedicated music venue and as well as regularly booking big name acts they also provide loads of opportunities for new and upcoming ones to get their foot through the door. 

However, despite the fact that it has been an integral part of Bristol's music scene for decades developers have plans to convert former offices nearby to luxury residential flats, which would give tenants the right to make noise complaints which could very easily lead to the enforced shutting down of the venue. Other venues have been forced to close in similar circumstances after a few complaints. It's not just the venue that would suffer, but also the nearby pubs and shops which depend upon its audience. 

There is no local objection to the former offices being used for other purposes, they could become artist studios, or they could be rented out piecemeal to start up businesses or charities etc. but the area is not suitable for residential use.

There's a petition below to block the development and to retain St Thomas St. (where the Fleece is based) as a commercial property street. Please sign it, as well as the petition posted by the OP if you feel saving these established independent venues is important!

true,archon88,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"&gt;The Crown is not the State.

It's a part of the state. Property of the Crown, such as the Crown Jewels or Buckingham Palace, is not property of the monarch or their family, and it cannot be disposed of by them. The monarchy is an institution of state, not a magical entitlement of a certain family to huge amounts of public money.

&gt;The Monarch has no real power.

If anything that's just as much an argument for getting rid of the institution. It's redundant.

&gt;By your logic, we should knock down all our old buildings because it's ""the 21st century, not the Tudor times"".

That's a total non sequitur. A better analogy would be bringing back the practice of blood sports and the legal concept of weregild in order to honour our heritage, or some such. Acknowledging that we have a past doesn't have to take the form of dragging the past into the present.

&gt;What possible difference (besides appeasing some butt-hurt Republicans) would it make?

Other than emphasising that the principles of equality before the law and democratic accountability are central to our society? Or saying that, in a society that is still not very equal, in principle anyone can be the head of state? To my mind that's a much better symbol than saying that power is the privilege of the few.

I've no problem admitting he's looked great in charge so far and where some people yesterday saw boring soccer against Germany, I saw good use of planning and strategy by a manager that knows football and is obviously familiar with his opposition. What keeps me distant from the squad and angry as a Texan are the way we're represented by the likes of Dempsey and brek Shea. I'm willing to admit I took special offense at their unprofessional behavior as I genuinely wanted these two shots to show the world that Texans CAN know football and produce talent to work out. Obviously these lofty dreams didn't pan out. Tim Howard, ok, you're right. He's been a professional and good example. I said that not all fans are bad. And I definitely have the humility to realize there was football before I started watching and often ask questions myself when there is an incident/player/whatever referenced that I'm not familiar with. It could be bad luck, it could be Dallas Texas, but either way that is not the typical fan I encounter. What I get is going to the pub and being surrounded by people yelling buzzwords like freedom, liberty, terrorists, I believe, merica(really I've never understood the obsession with making ourselves seem as if we can't correctly spell the word America?), and others. I get surrounded by people yelling shoot, shoot! Everytime a USMT player touches the ball no matter where on or off the pitch. I love a nice long ranger as well as the next guy. But calm down, celebrate when the goalie actually DOES score. The arrogance and entitlement are talking about people becoming instant experts every four years and spewing about how they can't believe player x who is having a good match but is far from great in his club career doesn't play for Manchester United or Real Madrid. Also everyone saying advancing or winning the cup will be good because people will ""finally start getting interested in soccer."" That's demeaning to the sport, disrespectful to the cup, and offensive to people all over the world who rarely if ever even see their country qualify for a World Cup but turn on the tv and watch every match proudly anyway. Support can't be dependent upon results. I realize that will sound crazy as my primary club team wins plenty of trophies. But I also wear our gear when we lose, get knocked out of tournaments, sack managers, or other less than glorious occasions. I can't say well, Rafa is in charge and the Europa league sucks so I don't care. FUCK NO! It's Chelsea motherfucking football club! You turn on the match and watch us play second tier tournaments the same as CL finals.  I just can't relate to people who act like they are doing the great sport a favor by ""guessing you'll get more into it"" if USMT wins more. NOSIR! The great sport is doing you a favor by existing. 

Again, I realize this was obscenely long, and my observations are far from accurate of all usmt fans. But this is what I've seen most frequently and why myself and many other Americans feel more connection when watching Mexico with our Mexican friends or a team of players I support on club level.

Now not everything is due to that, blue for boys and pink for girls is an example of a cultural gender role, but the main idea of boys preferring manipulatable objects and girls preferring dolls is something that is backed up by solid science.

This is sort of used to justify why the Thals and Kaleds look so much like Time Lords and Humans.

Personally, I'm blaming Clara.  Thanks to Mr. Moffat, we now have Claras at any point in space and time where the Doctor has been.  She's there to save him, which won't alwasy result in her immediate death, so there's a large number of Claras out there who now have a life to get back to.

true,spacetimebear,null,null,"Personally I think that a degree in an arts field of any kind and any grade is pretty worthless by itself. Sure its nice to have a degree if you want to get a job working in an office, wearing a suit and pretending you like it, but you don't. What I assume you will learn while studying your degree is skills that will be needed in a practical field, for instance, yes you might be pretty good at fancy illustrations but can you apply it practically? I'm gonna use Video Games as an example; Lets say you wanted to be an environment, character or concept artist, though you might be able to draw nicely you might be lacking key skills in these areas, knowledge of 3D modelling, texturing, materials i.e things that might be related to the field you want to work in - things which are often picked up through specific university modules. However, that's not to say that you can't learn practical skill sets outside of uni, the internet makes learning ridiculously accessible.

It's already illegal. I'm not sure there's much the Equalities Minister can do about that

&gt;Withdrawing passports from those at risk.

So, this would be not only difficult to do (How do we decide who is sufficiently at risk?), but also has worrying implications for civil liberties. Routinely confiscating citizens' passports because they may be at risk of a crime would be a controversial decision. Especially if the criteria for passport confiscation involves the citizen being a member of one or more minority groups.

&gt;Awareness raising with public servants who are likely to encounter those at risk (e.g. teachers, doctors, social workers, etc.)

Do you think that these public servants are not already aware of these issues in the communities that they serve?

Not at all. You're arguing to uproot our entire legal and Parliamentary system when you also acknowledge that it will actually bring no real benefit at the end of the day. Why bother? For a ""feel-good"" factor for a minority of Republicans?

It wouldn't be a better analogy. Those would be active parts of life, whereas the Royals are ceremonial.

How many prosecutions for it have there been since the law was passed? How many children has it happened to since the law was passed? It is the responsibility of the equalities minister to address this.

&gt; So, this would be not only difficult to do (How do we decide who is sufficiently at risk?), but also has worrying implications for civil liberties. Routinely confiscating citizens' passports because they may be at risk of a crime would be a controversial decision. Especially if the criteria for passport confiscation involves the citizen being a member of one or more minority groups.

This isn't preventing someone from travelling abroad for thought crime, this is preventing someone from being trafficked to be a deliberate victim of crime. Yes there are sensitivities about the fact that this affects certain groups and not others but again it's the job of the equalities minister to overcome these sensitivities in a fair and respectful way.

&gt; Do you think that these public servants are not already aware of these issues in the communities that they serve?

You'd be surprised at the difference a bit of risk awareness training can make. Many public servants don't know what to look for in at risk communities, know what to do if they feel there is a risk or feel confident of taking action even if they do see a risk.

As the article states, he implies he's from a far off planet in the distant future. He may believe he is alien, but what if he's actually just an evolved human?

Say, perhaps, The human race evolves so far we master the dimension of space time. Hell, we are already on that speeding train right now. So, who's to say we master the 4th dimension, and how to manipulate it. becoming masters of time, or **Time lords**.

After polluting earth beyond recognition we left to find a new home, with the best one being the great red planet of Gallifrey. As time progresses, the titles ""human"" and ""mortal"" are replaced with ""time lord"" and ""regeneration"" as the humans evolve so much to survive on this new problem, even to the point of a medically implanted second heart becoming a predominate feature as it gave it's user better survival ability.

Eventually the time lords forget they were ever human, and as such the doctor doesn't know he's just an evolved human.

The one problem with this is the fact that the doctor has traveled so much, you'd think he would've hit a point where the timelords were transitioning humans, but if he was that means he'd either be on Gallifrey (which he doesn't like doing) or he'd be on earth/the ship to Gallifrey. Which it's possible he just saw the humans as really advanced humans, not soon-to-be timelords.

I acknowledged no such thing.

&gt;So, a feel-good factor then.

That's cynical and unfair. Equality and accountability are not ""feel-good"" factors; they are central to fair and open societies. I think that choosing symbols matters, and symbols of openness, fairness and accountability are better than symbols of hereditary privilege.

&gt;So, a feel-good factor then, since that head of state would have no actual power?

Depends how a British Republic would be structured. In parliamentary republics such as Ireland, Presidents such as Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese have often been quite influential and widely-respected, rising above party politics and ""setting the tone"" for the nation.

&gt;Remember how we covered the whole ""they have no real power"" part?

Remember the importance of symbols. They also have a lot of soft power, including privileged access to politicians. Given that our current Prime Minister is a distant relative of the Royals (he's descended from William IV) it seems that the old network of privilege is alive and well.

&gt;Who cares what other countries do with their systems? That's their prerogative.

&gt;

&gt;__Frobisher__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) who appeared in the *[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine)* comic strip based on the long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* in the 1980s. He was a [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) of the [Sixth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Doctor) and [Seventh Doctors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor).

&gt;Frobisher is a __Whifferdill__, one of a [shape-changing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting) [extraterrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life) race. What is assumed to be his natural form, as seen in his first comic strip appearance, is [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid), pale yellow in color, three to four feet in height, with a round, featureless head, and wearing spectacles. However, he preferred to spend his free time in the form of a [penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin).

&gt;When he first appeared in *The Shape Shifter* (DWM #88-#89), written by [Steve Parkhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Parkhouse) with art by [John Ridgway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridgway_(comic_artist\)), Frobisher was a [private investigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator) calling himself ""Avan Tarklu"" (a play on the phrase ""Haven't a clue""). He came across [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) when an enemy of the Time Lord, Josiah Dogbolter, had placed a bounty on the Doctor in an effort to acquire his secrets and his TARDIS. After infiltrating the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), instead of turning the Doctor in for the money, Tarklu decided that he liked the [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) and helped him against Dogbolter; both split the advance bounty Tarklu had been given from Dogbolter. He then joined the Doctor on his journeys. He assumed the name of Frobisher because he felt that it sounded British and thought that the Doctor would like that.

true,DrCrazyFishMan1,null,null,"I have done a lot. in the past few days I have posted my opinion many times. People here are just making excuses because the situation sucks for Liverpool. At the end of the day, Luis Suarez has psychological issues, and whilst these things are tragic for him, He needs to be punished for his actions. Even as a Chelsea fan I feel sorry for him in the same way I feel sorry for anybody with a mental illness, but he needs a lengthy ban. maybe ""Liverpool don't deserve to be punished"", but this is the risk that you face when the club decided to keep him after his second biting incident. If he does it again, god knows what his punishment will be, and keeping him in the team is a risk the club must assess. 

I'm not going to say that Suarez is a bad person, anybody can lose it sometimes, but he committed a ""footballing crime"", so must face his punishment whatever it might me. 

People defend him saying that ""he is just so desperate to win, and will do anything to do it"", but that is bullshit! him biting a player off the ball whilst totally unprovoked is not about him being desperate for him to win, it is about having a psychotic episode - and that isn't acceptable in the worlds second biggest sporting competition. 

The article talks about Suarez ""cracking under pressure"", and I think that I bull to be honest. Every player on that pitch was under immense pressure. Every player in that competition was under immense pressure. Every player Suarez has ever played with and against will have faced immense pressure during their careers, yet NONE of them have reacted in a similar way to Suarez. Look at the two most under pressure players in the entire competition, Neymar and Messi - none of them have ever bitten another player! Lots of players came from terrible backgrounds, and football will have literally saved their lives - but none of them react like Suarez has done in the past. 

The whole article is an excuse for a brilliantly flawed player losing his mind on the pitch. lines like ""When it happened Suarez reverted helplessly to childhood"" and ""I think Luis Suarez is just another crazy mixed up kid"" make Suarez seem like a victim here. ""he's just a child who cannot control what he does"". well BULLSHIT! he is a grown man! a grown man who has to face up to his actions. 

the penultimate paragraph shows what I am saying perfectly.

""On Tuesday a fragile man just broke in the industry we all support as fans. He cracked in the pressure cooker we all built. We have created all this for our own entertainment. It’s our fun but it’s Luis Suarez’s existence. He clings onto the life he escaped to, in a wild and primal way. He cracked in the moment against Italy. Can we judge him till we have walked in his shoes? Can we deny that for the past year he has worked hard on himself. He fell back on impulse and hurt himself and his team and his family. He needs support and care, not stone throwers and lame jokes""

The person being talked about here is not a child whom has suffered terrible abuse. we are talking about a grown man! a grown man who has disgraced himself, his club, his country, and his profession.

Of course it makes more sense to punish people for actually trying to hurt someone. But i was just showing an (admittedly extreme) example of how something that isn't harmful would still end up getting a huge ban because it's so outside the nature of the game. 

Perhaps that's a flaw, but it's reality. I think with Suarez it come across as ""this guy doesn't care at all"" so the bans keep getting bigger. Also there is literally no precedent for someone biting players on the pitch, it's not like they can compare it to other acts. But you're right we can agree to disagree.

I've watched almost every game he has played in the past two years (Arsenal fan) and the only incident I can recall is that he received a red card two years ago for making a bad sliding tackle (and received a 3 match ban...), but he was going for the ball during the regular course of play. I don't think Suarez can say he was going for the ball, nor was it an incident that occurred during the regular course of play.

A more reasonable comparison is Emir Spahic receiving a 5 match ban for elbowing a player in the face, followed by a 7 match ban that same seaosn for elbowing another player in the face. The punishments became stronger and more pronounced because of his history of past behavior. In addition those elbows were much more dangerous if you watch the replays, in the sense that he directed his elbow at full force in the direction of the opponent's head, whereas Giroud's was more of a side-swipe ""get off of me"" gesture.

Finally, to address the argument that a bite is less dangerous than an elbow - that's true, but there is a reason why spitting can be considered assault and/or battery in many Western countries even though it is almost never hazardous to your health (""almost never"" meaning, like, if you spit a mouthful of peanuts at someone with a peanut allergy I guess theoretically that could be dangerous). There is a societal taboo towards contacting another person with bodily fluids and I think that is what FIFA is responding to. In addition it's easier to defend a bad tackle or even an elbow (if you are just setting up your body to fight for a header / you could argue you didn't see the opponent) by saying it was accidental, it was during the course of play and the player juts got carried away.

No it doesn't, they are decided by the leaders of Nation States. Hence why it was just declared in a vote, by the leaders of Nation States.

Gay pride which will be on the 2nd August.

Other things. Devils dyke is a really good place to trek around and the pub is really good too.
The music hall is really chilled and a nice place to hang out at the weekend on the sea front. Live music. Slightly pricey drink wise though.
Check out a Komedia krater comedy night. It is pretty cheap on sunday evenings.
