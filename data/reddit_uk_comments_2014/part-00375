false,SleepingFish,null,null,"A mediocre midtable club that can also afford to spend over 100m in one window, look at the rest of the clubs you would consider midtable and compare their spending. Newcastle, Stoke, Hull City, Swansea for example. In the most recent transfer window these teams have spent the following.

* Newcastle: £38m
* Stoke: £3.4m
* Hull: £37.5m
* Swansea: £15m

You may well say that these teams aren't in Europe - bar Swansea - and therefore didn't need to spend as much on increasing squad depth.

So I looked at the likes of Tottenham and Everton too. In the previous window they spent the following&lt;/br&gt;


* Tottenham: £32m
* Everton:: £38m


And I know what you're going to say next, ""But Tottenham spent over £100m last season building depth."" Ok, fair enough. They spent the majority on players touching their prime. Soldado - albeit he hasn't quite worked out. Paulinho - Glimpses of quality. Eriksen - Shown true quality, the stand out signing. Meanwhile Capoue, Chadli and Chiriches all slot into their first team on occasion, with Lamela beginning to show promise now.


Regardless of Tottenham's £100m binge, from the previous transfer window of these 6 teams, only one of them was cost over £15m. That was Romelu Lukaku (£28). A monster with both huge ability, huge potential, proven Premier League quality and leading the line for his country - World Cup dark horse favourites, Belgium. Meanwhile we spent over £15m on the risky Balotelli (£16m), the unproven Markovic (£20m), the one season wonder Lovren (£20m) and Adam Lallana  (£25m).

I'm going off topic, so I'll reel it in, ""so liverpool should be a mediocre midtable club that gets knocked out by swiss and bulgarian champions right after nearly winning the premier league?"" The answer is No, no, we should not. Not after our spending this year, or the last few windows.

He has always had injury troubles in his time at Liverpool but as he was growing older he just couldn't be trusted for a long run of games anymore. This season we have played two games a week more times than we have not, having a player as injury prone as Dan lead the defense would never have been a good idea.

At Brondby he can now play for his boyhood club at a pace that doesn't strain his back as much as the Premier League and Champions League would, while also being given the chance to recover properly between games.

He's a fantastic player and a great man and is greatly missed, I just think that in the long run this was the best decision for both Dan and the club.

false,Alaskan_Thunder,null,null,"To ~~quote~~ ~~read off~~ copy a certain online encyclopedia""Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is located on the mainland of the United States. The official name of the state, State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, derives from the merger of two settlements. Rhode Island colony was founded near present-day Newport, on what is now commonly called Aquidneck Island, the largest of several islands in Narragansett Bay. Providence Plantations was the name of the colony founded by Roger Williams in the area now known as the city of Providence.[9]
It is unclear how Aquidneck Island came to be known as Rhode Island, although there are two popular theories.
The explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, in 1524 noted the presence of an island near the mouth of Narragansett Bay, which he likened to the Ottoman island of Rhodes (part of modern Greece). Subsequent European explorers were unable to precisely identify the island that Verrazzano had named. The Pilgrims who later colonized the area assumed that Verrazzano's ""Rhodes"" was Aquidneck.
Giovanni da Verrazzano named a place on Rhode Island Puntum Iovianum in honor of his friend Paolo Giovio (Jovium in Latin) (1483 - 1542) humanist and historian. Giovio owned the Codex Cellere of Giovanni da Verrazzano containing the text of his first trip.
A second theory concerns the fact that Adriaen Block, during his expeditions in the 1610s, passed by Aquidneck, described in a 1625 account of his travels as ""an island of reddish appearance"" (in 17th-century Dutch, ""een rodlich Eylande"").[10] Historians have theorized that this ""reddish appearance"" resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.[11][12][12]

Verrazzano Monument, Providence, Rhode Island.
The earliest documented use of the name ""Rhode Island"" for Aquidneck was in 1637, by Roger Williams. The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words: ""Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Isle of Rodes or Rhode-Island."" The name ""Isle of Rodes"" is found used in a legal document as late as 1646.[13][14] Dutch maps as late as 1659 call the island ""Red Island"" (Roodt Eylant).
Williams was a theologian forced out of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Seeking religious and political tolerance, he and others founded ""Providence Plantations"" as a free proprietary colony. ""Providence"" referred to the divine providence and ""plantations"" referred to an English term for a colony.
""State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations"" is the longest official name of any state in the Union. On June 25, 2009, the General Assembly voted to allow the people to decide whether to keep the name or drop ""and Providence Plantations"" due to the misperception that the name related to slavery.[15] The referendum election was held on this subject during the November 2, 2010 elections, and the people overwhelmingly (78% to 22%) voted to keep the original name.[16]""",0,1418364101,null,0,false,0,cmsltx8,t3_2p0jag,t1_cmsltx8,t1_cmsjqkd,null,1425473108,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Supply and demand exactly. The cost of living goes up because the cost is passed on to the consumer and there's an increase in disposable income.


&gt;The counter point is ""if nobody wants to do them why are they done by desperate unskilled foreigners?"" a) they're desperate so it is wrong b) ""we're lazy"" which is in itself racist so you can't apply an argument that isn't acceptable to one group but is acceptable to others.

Well no. Foreigners do it because to them the wages are good but also it's a stepping stone to a better life for their children. Raise them in the UK. Better education system, legal system and economy. Their children have a better future and the chance to be successful. And to me, those are ""quality""  immigrants.

false,joethepro36,null,null,"I was expecting a clash of opinions and got it within the first half of the show. The second half was more subdued than the first.

**Camilla Cavendish (Columnist for the Sunday Times):**
She made a lot of good points throughout the show, she was the most thorough of the panellists in her answers. The best point she made was about a lack of detail in politics. Many politicians don't ever go into the detail of politics and in fact later in the episode she decries politicians who don't read bills. 

**Russell Brand (Comedian, Campaigner):**
Far more lively in the first half of the show, he was essentially asked the question ""Why don't you stand?"". Indeed, why doesn't he stand? Bloody hypocrite. His heart is in the right place certainly, but if he is to command any sense of respect in the political world he needs to stand for MP himself. He cannot sit at the sidelines and continue to be critical if he wants to be respected in politics. It matters not if he wins or not, it's the trying that needs to be achieved. Farage said what many of us were thinking at the time that at least they're ""trying"".

His best raised issue was highlighting how anyone concerned about immigration should look to reform the current government and its corruption. ""Would the country be better after that?"" is the gist of his question to those opposed to mass migration. He grew very quiet in the second half after being confronted with standing though.

**Mary Creagh (MP):**
Definitely the most left wing on the panel, to be expected given her position as Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. She argued against the expansion of grammar schools across the country and for increased spending or in her terms, investment.

She jumped on Brand for being an example of ""men talking over women"". He quickly apologises.

**Penny Mordaunt (MP):**
Had a little egg on her face when asked about how she said ""cock"" multiple times in a speech in parliament on a dare.

Raises an excellent point about immigration, saying that what people in Britain want is a sense of control over their borders. She says this, supporting a female member of the audience who effectively says ""It's not the numbers that matter, but vetting the people coming in"".

**Nigel Farage (MEP):**
One of his first points was about career politicians. After working for 20 years in the city can he be compared with Milliband who's not worked in industry or enterprise?

He comes out fully in favour of the expansion of grammar schools and sees the weakening of grammar schools to have been detrimental to many tens of thousands of bright children.

And Thursday nights just mean your games are on Sundays. It's like a Wednesday CL game and then your league game is on Saturday at times. 

It's still a European competition with a chance, something you haven't even been in for years now. 

Yes the league is still possible of course, but again, it involves consistency over 20 over games instead of 2 leg games where you can specifically prepare for them and try. 

The purpose of a bigger squad is to compete in more competitions as well and to have options. 

Using Swansea and Everton as examples only serve to show how the smaller clubs can't really manage and lump yourself into that category. If you want to be a big club or treated like one, you try and compete in all competitions you're in, especially having not been in Europe for sometime now. 

Financial differences aside, it is a European trophy taken seriously by many clubs too. Also, more games give you a semblance of consistency as well too if properly planned and worked on. 

It just seems very odd to not care about a European competition with a chance to win it when you haven't played in Europe for years and then decide to give up on the second tier when you weren't anywhere close to having a real shot in the first tier and it's unknown still how the season can go. You might still qualify next year or you might not and if the latter happens, this was a big chance at Europe still and the biggest for the past few years.

I'm a biased american so I really dislike when I see a crappy player suggested to go to MLS because he would get paid and tear it up, but I just don't think it's fair to assume Torres would do well in MLS. Torres' issues go well beyond football, his mind isn't right, plain and simple.

I don't think it would be smart to go to MLS because if he were to struggle in the transition, that would take his confidence from the 1-2(out of 10) that it's at right now, and drive it straight into a -100. I'm not saying he would struggle because MLS is all that great, because it isn't, I'm saying him transitioning to America, flying coach, not having ridiculously amazing training staff/facilities, and support would not be beneficial to his confidence and mental state. He needs to go back to Spain and play where he is most comfortable if he ever wants to get back to being even serviceable.

Also, we're not stupid. Pretty much all of us know he's shit. The DP signings that teams over here make, lately, are much more mid-level talent from other leagues or aging stars. Torres is not high enough to be considered mid level, that old, or a star to be honest.

Mortgage family want double glazing cost £2500+, council tenant will get it for £0 however they will wait longer for it. Mortgage family want to decorate their house they have to pay for the paint or pay for a decorator, council tenant will either have decorators come in and paint the house free of charge or the council will give vouchers to buy paint to do it themselves.

I don't see what this law had to do with refusing to help people. It's about not being forced to promote or participate in a cause you disagree with. It's entirely possible to disagree with someone's cause, refuse to promote that cause, and still 'help' them, whatever it is you might mean by that.

Respect isn't about whether people are willing to support and promote your cause. Respect is about the attitude you take towards people you disagree with. The issue could very well be turned around to ask how it is respectful to ask someone to promote something they disagree with? How is it respectful to ask someone to endorse a cause that their God disappeoves of? Would it be respectful to ask a Jew to make you a bacon sandwich? Would it be disrespectful for them to politely decline?

I actually don't think it should be legal to do many of the things you mention. For many of them, the activity in question isn't closely related to a particular cause. Renting a room for a night doesn't mean that people will engage in sexual activities you disagree with, so I don't think that you are facilitating or ensorsing anything in the way that producing a message would be. Same goes for eating a meal in a restaurant. In fact I think the DUP strategy is a bit misguided and they'd be better off clarifying what is and isn't discrimination rather than creating exemptions which aren't necessarily well thought out.

As for talking openly, you have the exact same right. You could distribute leaflets, yell through a loud hailer or talk openly about your worldview, even if it offends someone. That's the point of freedom of speech - that what you say doesn't have to be pre-approved. Why shouldn't religious people enjoy those freedoms when everyone else does? There's no privilege there.

£200 a month looks manageable, doesn't it? £50 a week looks even more manageable. But over how many months and how many weeks is something people tend not to think about.  
Pay £200 for 60 months and you've paid £12k - enough for half the price of an A3 with the other half as a balloon payment at the end.

Huddersfield is a fairly diverse town with a fairly large (for UK) non-native (whatever that means) population, that is well established. There's a large student population, with lots of international and mature students.

The town centre is quite compact, with a mix of independent shops, bars, cafés, and chain stores. Once outside of the centre the urban density quickly declines, and you can find yourself on open [moorland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorland) in most directions within 5-10 miles.

It's in a good location, almost half-way between Leeds and Manchester. Either can be reached by train in around 20, and 35 minutes respectively.

But, as it sits on the east side of the [Pennines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennines), and well, this is England, Huddersfield is quite rainy. Manchester suffers similar (some say worse) weather systems being on the other side of the Pennines. Also, due to this location, everything in Huddersfield is on a hill.

This is a fundimental issue with a capital system which does not rely on ratio's but on actual figures.

I've been sort of having a thought floating around my head for a week or so now that the way we 'visualize' profit in our mental systems is probably partly the cause of this.

We view profit as separate from income.  But ultimately it should be viewed as such:

Your company has a gross turn over of $100b.  Its costs are $80b that $20b in profit is going to either be invested in research (good) invested in other projects as capital (good) or used as paying share dividends (most likely) - this is basically the income of the shareholders.  Which is nice, except its taxed lower than income (due to the inherent risk of investment) so those profits are in effect income for the super wealthy if they are not re-invested in the business.

Instead of these profits going up top, they could be reinvested into the business to pay better salaries to the other members of staff.  Or if you want to heavily invest your staff into your business, by buying company shares and giving them to staff.

These things would reduce these problems and reduce inequality but they wont be done.

Short of it; its because they think that's what you do.              
                     
It used to be the people with real money did go out and buy expensive cars, expensive clothes and spend like they didn't care.             
This was mostly old money; money from family businesses, inheritance, etc.                
This all stopped about many years ago, the old money started spending more then they could support.           
A enter a lot of new people starting businesses and gaining a lot of money.                     
This new money started with nothing so most don't see the point in spending to prove they have money.                 
Between then and now old money has continued dying out and new money has kept increasing.                        
                  
A lot of people, particularly people who haven't been around money or people with money, still see the old money stereotype to be true and how money affects people.                   
So when one of these wants to give the illusion of money they do as the old money did/do; buy expensive cars, clothes and meals.                
When in truth most of the old money continuing this way are now the all fur coat and no knickers, they don't really have the money to maintain and are in debt because of it.

Yes there is a legal requirement to profit return for shareholders (Which I think is fucking retarded if you stop and think about the concept of perpetual growth) there is also a legal requirement to pay the minimum wage - these two things are mutually exclusive eventually.  You just need to play the system out with enough iterations to realize you end up with a very big problem.  Especially big if you do not close tax loop holes.


Or perhaps, we could spread out the capital across more people - so no single person is at of much risk if the business fails, so it can take more risks and potentially create more benefit and wealth?

Concentrating ever increasing wealth into fewer hands will only reduce innovation (save for a few notable examples: Elon Musk etc) the majority of financial institution want safe bets -  for good reasons, our pensions rely on those bets!

But those pensions are being inflated at the cost of the current lower end of the work force basically being paid not enough to live with dignity.

I suppose in all the build up there was a lot of ""Brand vs Farage"" which would have fed his already inflated ego and possibly made him feel like he had to make constant snipes towards him.

I think a lot of the points he makes are issues that need to be addressed but he did not put them across well. The woman in the audience put it far better than him when simply saying immigration wouldn't matter were it not for the masses of under paid taxes by huge corporations.

false,TOSH2345,null,null,"I've noticed this, I'm in London and was working for a company where the London office was basically a hot desking office where the majority of people came in from all over the UK. And I noticed how obsessed everyone was with having flashy cars, they were all on modest incomes but drove beemers, mercedes, etc. 

In London I've noticed that what type of car you drive really isn't a big deal, having a car is unique in itself and its more of just a run around than something you spend a lot of money or care on. In London people are far more focused on where they live and buying a house rather than renting. The only people I know who drive flashy cars are petrol heads, or who do have the money to spend outright on a flashy motor, or who can afford to finance something they use maybe once a week. So people talking about what car they had, and what they wanted to get really stuck out to me after 10 years of living in London, where most people just talk about housing.

So I put it down to a couple of things, housing being cheaper outside London so most of the people I worked with were already homeowners, or they lived at home still, so they had the disposal income to spend on a car. They also used their cars way more, some spending hours a day in it. So it makes sense to drive something state of the art and comfortable.

I also realised that its partly a status symbol, buying a flashy big house was out of reach, but paying £300-£500 on a month on a flashy car was possible. As they drove everywhere so their car is the most visual status symbol they had. Its like someone having a big flashy watch.",0,1418380300,null,0,1418383856,0,cmsprnf,t3_2p22hp,t1_cmsprnf,t3_2p22hp,null,1425471200,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,"&gt; Consider that he's on Question Time and is therefore constantly under time pressure. He was also, visibly, restraining himself from his usual hyper-verbosity shtick. He did come up with some stats on voting number though.

&gt; I'm quite sure you probably won't do this, but it's worth a try. He talks about this stuff a lot on his Trews thing on YouTube. He always has studies and sources to back things up there because he has time to prepare. If you think the stuff he says is untrue, then by all means check the videos and the sources.


It isn't limited to Question Time. He does it on Newsnight and other Interviews as well. Essentially whenever he is in a format where his statements are questioned. When he is doing his YouTube videos or speaking to a like-minded audience at a rally he says what he wants to say and jumps from issue to issue in a superficial but verbose way. He'll make a statement and maybe given a moralistic motive to the statement but he never goes into more depth than that or puts forward a realistic alternative. He'll make a contentious statement and it's fine because there is no one were to pull him up on it. 

You can look at the [Newsnight interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqsFp0J22Hc) with Evan Davis for an example. Davis was using statements from Brand's own book so it's not as if these issues were sprung on him. He should be expected to have a sufficient knowledge of the issues to give an answer. He said capitalism doesn't work and Davis pointed out that whilst it may have serious problems it has, overall, brought more wealth to people and illustrated this with a graphic of average wealth showing a decline over the last 20/30 years about a dramatic increase over the last 100 years. Brand mocked him for the graph. Davis challenged him about giving General Motors back 'to the people' by pointing out it's already owned by Unions etc. Brand first tried to talk over him and then made a straw man of his argument. Davis asked him about 9/11 and Brand said he didn't want to talk about silly conspiracies despite the fact he seemed willing to write about it. He has a constant tactic of talking in vague statements, changing the topic when he is challenged, and talking over people. 

The fact you suggest we engage with this arguments only in a environment where he cannot be challenged and where he speaks to a like minded audience is telling. He can only be effective as long as no questions his statements, his sources, or the premises he sneaks into questions. Whenever he or his ideas face even the mildest security he withers away and will either 1) change the topic 2) make a joke 3) question the personal motivation or integrity of the person who challenges him.

True; but the management are obligated to provide maximum return for shareholders.  So will priorities their interests (generally) over a minimum wage worker.

&gt;But wealth is not finite and they are not taking up resources that would otherwise have gone to someone else but providing the stability for economic growth to occur so that everyone gets a slice for a slightly larger pie.

The problem arises that if the cost of living is going up by 5% a year.  and this increased pie is only sharing 1% of it to the bottom 10% that is a lot of people who are now falling further behind the cost of living.

Yes the pie can always get bigger, but unless that growth is at least equal to the cost of living increase at the bottom you are in negative growth.

TL:DR - Need more data. Paulinho has only played 105 PL Mins and 292 EL Mins. Anyone making *any* judgment now is being silly.

Deep Dive: Poch has a little more experimentation to do. Some emerging trends:

(1) Stambouli is the best specialist DM (particularly good tackler)

(2) Capoue is the best distributing DM (particularly good passer)

(3) Bentaleb/Mason/Paulinho are all rounders with the former being better defenders and the latter being better attackers.

(4) Dembele is the enigma - best all round stats but my eyes are telling me that all of this talent is not translating on to the pitch.

What do I think? I dunno anymore. I desperately need to see how Stambouli does in a PL game to see whether he's the real deal or not. I think Mason and Bentaleb is too lightweight for any *big* game (Exhibit a = Chelsea). In an ideal world I would model the partnerships to assess for ""team effects"". In a 4-2-3-1 system, looking at the numbers you would think that Paulinho and Dembele belong in the ""3"" unit rather than the ""2"" unit. But while Demeble passes/dribbles well enough (albeit slowly) he doesn't shoot anywhere near enough, and while Paulinho shoots enough (2013/14 data rather than this season) I'm not sure whether he is creative in other ways passing wise. To be fair, the system is new to all of them so my own view is that Poch shuffles the pack all season and makes a proper assessment by June 2015.

Agreed.

&gt; it suppresses wage rates. 

But it shouldn't - that's simply because the companies employing the immigrants at lower pay are profiteering. 

&gt; Per capita GDP is stalling, wages eroded by inflation,

That wasn't caused by immigrants.

&gt;the slack in the labour market is funded by state benefits while the businesses register abroad and write off their taxes. 

Agreed.

&gt;It is a cunning plan and it is supported by everyday people terrified of being accused of being racist. 

I don't think that's true - it's supported by successive governments who are unwilling to force those companies to pay taxes. Besides, I think we're a long way past the point where we can say ""immigration is never talked about because people don't want to be accused of racism"". It's talked about more than anything else. More, say, than the issue of the richest few percent of this country amassing vast wealth while the poorest are made to live in worse and worse conditions. Again, immigration did not cause that.

&gt;People generally refuse to accept that there is any upper limit to the number of people a country can accommodate, which I find absurd. I don't care what colour people are, I just wish there were fewer people generally.

By accommodate, do you mean physical space or infrastructure? Because there ought to be *plenty* of money for increasing that infrastructure in line with the population growth we've seen.

&gt;Immigration keeps gene pools healthy 

Erm... Sure, I guess.

&gt;but excessive immigration can lower quality of life, 

It *can*, yes, but it *shouldn't* if the people benefiting most from that immigration paid the fair share of the profits it makes them back in tax.

I don't believe that is true, but it's a bit blurry too. We *do* control non-EU immigration, for example.

Have you ever lived together before? If not, do not buy a house together. At least live in a shared house (just you two!) for a year or two.

You need a watertight plan for other expenses, too. It's not just the deposit. Who pays for surveys, solicitors, maintenance and repairs to the house, bills, taxes, other fees? What happens when one of you meets someone and wants to move them in - or wants to move out? What happens when one of you changes jobs? Do incoming partners pay rent to both of you, or contribute to one person's share of the mortgage? Does this mean they then legally own part of the house? 

Selling the house if things go wrong is not quick and easy. I've known couples who own together break up and have to live with each other - bringing new partners home - while the house goes on the market. Can you continue to live with this person if the two of you fall out?

Who decides how to decorate or amend the house? Who looks after the garden?

Do you need to buy a £300k house? You'll have to pay more for bills and council tax and it'll take a lot more looking after than a £115k house.

To be honest I'd avoid this like the plague. Save, save, save; rent; buy with someone you want to stick with for life, or alone.",0,1418381517,null,0,false,0,cmspzpe,t3_2p2gp8,t1_cmspzpe,t3_2p2gp8,null,1425471096,18,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,18

A lot of places you could get a place for this - a one or two bedroom flat, or even a decent house.

If you can possibly do that, I advise you to do so. You can always rent a room to a lodger for some extra cash, but that way you have some control. Even if you buy somewhere a bit dingy and spend a few years painting the walls, room by room, as you can afford the time.

If it is the right decision to do so then this is exactly what they *should* do. A business's job is not to provide jobs to whoever needs them but to make money for shareholders. However, they don't fire people willy-nilly and if the worker is providing value (not necessarily making money) then they'd be wrong to fire them. 

&gt; The problem arises that if the cost of living is going up by 5% a year. and this increased pie is only sharing 1% of it to the bottom 10% that is a lot of people who are now falling further behind the cost of living.

I see what you are saying (although a more accurate analogy would be to say that although the pie gets bigger the poorest each get a smaller slice which is about inequality rather than living standards). The simple fact is that when the government spends unsustainably there will inevitably come a time when cuts need to be made. 

&gt; Yes the pie can always get bigger, but unless that growth is at least equal to the cost of living increase at the bottom you are in negative growth... This is a very bad thing surely?

It's never nice to cut living standards for anyone, let alone those at the bottom of the pile, but when they have been living beyond their means as a result of government largess and the government can no longer afford to subsidise that lifestyle the borrowed money needs to be paid back.

I don't think that's true - his YouTube stuff is very directed, single issue per episode. Yes, he waffles, that's his shtick.

&gt; never goes into more depth than that or puts forward a realistic alternative

He often goes into more depth, but he is a comedian who is *highlighting* a great injustice in our society. He isn't claiming to be anything other than that. He says ""You're all being constantly screwed over the by the wealthy and influential, why do you put up with it?"". I happen to agree with him, regardless of who he is. There are plenty of studies, stats and examples that show that to be true but I'm not going to sit here and give you a list of my sources for that any more than I would to show you that man-made climate change is real. It simply is true and it's time we stopped getting bogged down in the semantics of who said it and how they said it and do something about it. Brand is talking at a very high level about these issues and he clearly doesn't want to be bogged down in the minutiae. That's fine - if that's what he wants to do then more power to him. I'd rather he did that than nothing at all.

By the way, he often talks about his solution. It is for people to come together and organise themselves at a local level - like the New Era Estate thing. Form unions and cooperatives. That's something else I agree with. I don't think he should become a politician, christ no, but I *would* like to see him kick that off in a some public way. Organise a few events, get some people to explain exactly how that would work.

&gt; Davis asked him about 9/11 and Brand said he didn't want to talk about silly conspiracies despite the fact he seemed willing to write about it.

2) Love the idea of a cute, adorable puppy but not a huge slobbering hound? No problem, the Holo-dog 3000 can age to suit your needs, meaning it can stay a puppy forever or age in line with you, it's owner.

3) Does your landlord say no pets? No problem! The holo-dog 3000 isn't a pet, it's a consumer electronics device, so you can have man's best friend wherever you live.

4) How many times have people said they want a dog but they don't have the time or inclination to walk, feed, and clean up after their dogs? Well you can rest easy knowing the holo-dog 3000 requires none of these things.

5) Vets bill are expensive right? Well the holo-dog 3000 comes with a 12 month warranty, so any break downs in the first 12 months are totally free of charge. We offer repair services at competitive prices outside of the 12 months and we also offer an insurance scheme.

6) Because the holo-dog 3000 is beamed from our data centre on mars, he is stored in the cloud so no matter what happens you can transfer your dog and it's personality should you need to replace your hardware in your home.

He waffles because his points are simplistic so he dresses it up in verbose prose so they seem more substantial than they are. 

&gt; He often goes into more depth, but he is a comedian who is highlighting a great injustice in our society. He isn't claiming to be anything other than that. He says ""You're all being constantly screwed over the by the wealthy and influential, why do you put up with it?"". I happen to agree with him, regardless of who he is. There are plenty of studies, stats and examples that show that to be true but I'm not going to sit here and give you a list of my sources for that any more than I would to show you that man-made climate change is real. It simply is true and it's time we stopped getting bogged down in the semantics of who said it and how they said it and do something about it. Brand is talking at a very high level about these issues and he clearly doesn't want to be bogged down in the minutiae. That's fine - if that's what he wants to do then more power to him. I'd rather he did that than nothing at all.

I don't want sources. I know, and most people know, that there is inequality in society. 

How many times however can Brand milk this fact with his populist rhetoric? The fact he is right about inequality doesn't give him a free pass when discussing the complicated arguments that arise from that argument. Why does it exist? What can be done about? Who is to blame? 

He constantly fails to do this and as you say something needs to be done about these issues and so what value is there in Brand being invited back onto to these programs and given  these platforms when he fails to evolve his activism or his arguments? There is only so many times you can shout 'bankers' before people find out the Emperor has no clothes. 

&gt; Of course he did. Please. It was blindingly obvious that Davis was simply trying to discredit him by inferring he was a conspiracy nut. Brand put him back in his box about that and rightly so.

Davis was quoting from *Brand's own book*. If Brand didn't want to discuss conspiracies then don't right about them.

Now days new builds will have a gas central heating systems and gas boilers to control both heat and water as it saves space for the developer as all you have to worry about is placing the flue for the boiler and where to bung the cylinder and fob it off as an airing cupboard to whoever buys is. Some hot water cylinders will have an electric immersion in them so if gas fails, hot water can still be created to reduce health issues.

&gt;

&gt;The __Gay__ class were a class of twelve [fast patrol boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrol_boat) that served with the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) from the early 1950s. All were named after types of soldiers or military or related figures, prefixed with 'Gay'. The class could be fitted as either [motor gun boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_gun_boat) or [motor torpedo boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_torpedo_boat), depending on the type of armament they carried.

Get one with low depreciation and you have a longer term tradable asset. People, especially the upstarters fresh from a raise or promotion, are infatuated with the prospect of having a 'new' car and can't accept the fact that it's a poor financial decision, which I've found from my experience is usually based upon status anxiety rather than simple practicality reasons. People are easily drawn into these attractive financing deals for a shiny new car but completely fail to see/accept the long term ramifications and risks involved. It's just getting yourself into greater debt.

Yes, if you're earning a mint and are absolutely financially comfortable then this point won't apply, but to those on an average salary with average debt circumstances such as those defined in OPs original query, then I feel they should be thinking more about long term savings and pragmatism rather than splashing a significant amount of money every month on something which boils down to a status symbol.

I think the thing that gets in most people's way is believing that they can't do something - for example many people just state that they _cannot_ do maths.

Pensions are due to an aging demographic and the 'greying of Europe' as been on the cards for decades and no-one really knows what to do as it's a difficult problem.

Housing benefit is expensive because of the housing crisis which is due to [ridiculous planning regulations preventing building](http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/08/housebuilding-britain) and the lack of land value taxation ([supported by pretty much all economists](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/11/economist-explains-0)). With a proper strategy we could massively reduce Housing Benefit costs and create sufficient housing for our citizens.

The decline in real wages since the 70's is probably due to globalisation more than anything else - and the cost of living has also plummeted since the 1970's if you look at the price of food etc. and our lives are dominated by cheap technology that didn't even exist then.

The Dutch and the French are definitely on our side here, and Germany recently won it's case to restrict benefits to people who have never worked in the country before (which also allows us to do the same). It will be much easier to fix this problem (and it is a problem) if we work with other EU states. Some progress has been made, income based job seekers and child benefit is prohibited for 3 months, housing benefit is no longer given to EEA migrants, more needs to be done to link welfare to contributions though.

As for the worker issues, we were one of the nations pushing for expansion of the EU into eastern Europe (the PM is still pushing for Turkey to join ffs), so the glut of unskilled labor is something of an issue for ourselves to be blamed for. But a far bigger problem is that our education system really isn't that good, and is too focused on a narrow set of academic approached. So rather than ensuring that people can learn trades, or technical jobs, and that academically capable students of all backgrounds are able to get into grammar schools we focused on this idea of everyone getting the same schooling and everyone going to university.

Basically, I think we use the EU as something to blame for all our problems when many of them are problems we caused our self.",0,1418385934,null,0,false,0,cmsqusz,t3_2p19q3,t1_cmsqusz,t1_cmsqknr,null,1425470693,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Moreover, I find it highly unlikely that the country as a whole is overcrowded. London? Possibly. Yorkshire? No. As with ""the bankers the bonuses"", so is ""immigration and benefits"" a diversionary tactic to apportion blame for a complex series of problems on one convenient and emotive soundbite.

This is such a tough issue. I remember what it was like to habitually cut myself, and I either rejected the help or felt like it didn't *actually* help. I don't know what if anything could have helped me to stop outright, but I think things could have been done to reduce how harmful it was while I worked my way through it. 

**More understanding** would have probably helped. I don't think people realise how they use shaming and guilting language when talking about cutting, and the effect that that has. People also don't understand that minimising kids' struggles is super-unhelpful. 

As adults we *know* that falling out with your friends or being dumped by someone you ""went out with"" for a couple of weeks isn't really that important, but it's so important to remember that the kids do not see it that way. Also don't forget that if you minimise the small things, the kids are less likely to tell you that they have been sexually assaulted or are being beaten at home or something. I was legitimately depressed, but it was constantly brushed aside as ""teenage angst"". Remember that just because teenagers seem to have an easy life, that doesn't mean that there isn't a storm going on under the surface that they do not understand and that scares them.

**I have some tips that I'd like to give to anyone who is dealing with a kid who is self harming**. All under the assumption that you aren't the reason they're struggling in the first place, of course... 

Truly listening to them so important. **Don't make it about you and how awful it makes you feel**, because adding guilt on top of everything else is really not going to help. You might think it might help to show them how much you care by showing them how much it hurts you, but odds are they do love you and already feel horrible for how upset they know you must be. Make sure the focus is on how much you care about their health and happiness. It's tough, but you have to try and take a step back from how awful you almost certainly feel about it. Remember that they're almost certainly not trying to do it to punish you.

**Don't make them feel ashamed.** I went shopping with my Mum one summer and was wearing a short-sleeved top. She said ""can't you wear a hoodie or something? I hate to think what people think of you and of me when they see your arms."" That was over a decade ago, and it sticks with me to this day as one of the most hurtful things she ever said to me. That comment and others like it made sure that I never opened up to anyone who had the power to help me. 

**Don't patronise them.** Don't assume any time they're in the bathroom or in their rooms that they're cutting, and come and knock on the doors and ban them from locking the bathroom door. Don't try to confiscate literally anything they could hurt themselves with (I know this can be a fine balance, because obviously a proper knife or a razor blade really should be taken away, as the potential for accidental suicide is too high). When my parents took away my shitty little nail scissors I just felt... I don't know. Bad. It didn't help. I never even thought of using them. I felt like I'd been put in the nuthouse - no sharp edges allowed. I was sure my shoelaces would be taken next. I've also heard of people making their kids stand in their underwear so that they could be inspected for cuts. Humiliating. People think this is a good idea?

NOTE: This is mostly informed by my experiences, and I would really appreciate anyone else who differs chiming in. This issue is incredibly complex, but conversation and education are the keys to improving things. 

---

One final word: **don't assume that just because the cuts or bruises have stopped that the self-harm has stopped.** Eventually I stuffed my self-harm beneath the surface. I stopped cutting habitually around 18 (I started at 13), but the urge is still there even now (I'm 25). Very, very occasionally in times of high stress or pain I still do it because it's the only coping mechanism I know. But generally it just manifests itself in other ways. All that the people around me did was push the cuts under the surface. Out of sight, out of mind. Well, their minds at least.

**Help the kids develop coping mechanisms now**, before they end up a mess of an adult who has no idea what the hell to do about the lingering urges.

edit: I realised that even now I'm still strongly feeling the effects of the shaming. It's not ""very, very occasionally"" that I cut. It's not a lot by any means, but I tried to minimise it. I also didn't mention that I hit myself and make other non-lasting marks. The shame and the ""don't make people feel uncomfortable by admitting you're ill"" is still very much in the forefront of my mind. I'm not better, and I should take my own advice and be okay with admitting that.

Your point about servicing hassle is legitimate. Of course some financing deals include extra costs and promise  peace of mind, which is what make them attractive. But that's why I said to obtain a reliable second hand car, perhaps after doing a degree of research and due diligence on historical faults, cost of repair and daily running costs. It is a major purchase so it should be a decision taken seriously, after weighing up many factors. Plus getting a popular model that will have an abundance of spare parts all around. Older Hondas or Toyotas for example are cheap as anything to run and insure, simple to repair and last years. I wouldn't classify them as old bangers either. Learning some basic maintenance too is not difficult and can offset some notable expenses rather than taking it in every time something goes wrong. And being more self sufficient is never a bad thing in any circumstance!

Your point comparing a car to a train ticket is a little unfounded. Yes the costs are the same per month but the train is a completely different medium of transport and allows greater and faster access to places vastly less accessible by car, like central London. Plus you would only get a train to work when you are working, which makes it by default a sound financial decision as there is no alternative (maybe cycling, actually). If the worst happens and get made redundant (which is not an outlandish scenario) then with a financed car you are still responsible for interest repayments.

Better education and support will undoubtedly help people do better but it won't allow everyone to be able to do everything. 

There are problems regarding how it is more difficult to learn things as you get older, a problem of resources, not just for the education and support of people needing to retrain but how those people support themselves while they retrain in this age of slashing state budgets and also the aforementioned problem of the providers of training not being able to keep up with what skills people are going to need to be trained on in the future.

* Loss of control – 17%
* Failure to judge other person’s path or speed – 15%
* Poor turning or manoeuvring – 11%
* Cyclist wearing dark clothes at night – 10%
* Not displaying lights at night or in poor visibility – 5%

No, so he's got to make astute signings like Torres that are short term answers.

Nobody's saying Torres is going to be the answer to our problems, but he can't really do worse than Borini and Lambert, and if we sell Borini and get Torres we can free up some cash to buy a keeper. 

In my view Torres would be a better striker than half of the strikers we currently have. If we got him on a free for £60k p/w or less I wouldn't be complaining.

false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You're yet to give me an example for how the niqab infringes your rights personally other than 'I don't like it'.

You're suggesting that people generally don't mind talking to a mask? That there's no precedent? Even in countries right next to ours? Good luck with that.

&gt;you can't sell me the 'it's offensive to men' argument, it's just ludicrous.

I don't need to sell it to you - your not agreeing/ understanding/ acknowledging it doesn't change anything, it's already present. Wearing the thing *in the first place* is ludicrous - but if you think finding it insulting is that silly, what's the basis for wearing one again? Do you really think there's no opposite of the assumption of a woman wearing a bikini must be up for it because she's doing so?

&gt;What is remotely sexist about a woman not wanting to let men see their own body/face?

When was it decided that there's no difference between the two?

&gt;You seem to think that most people agree with you on this, and the fact is that they don't.

You're basing that on...?

&gt;Most people either think people should wear what they want or just don't care. 

That's right - but that's not really the discussion, is it? Wanting to see someone's face doesn't automatically translate into dictating every item of clothing that people can wear, so stop associating the two.

&gt;What is more repressive to a woman's agency - forcing them to cover their face in public, or forcing them to not cover their face in public

Allowing someone to wear something that is seen across the world as a symbol of something women are forced to do. You *don't* get to dictate the association just because you want to pretend that it's everyone else's problem and not yours. I could give hundreds of examples from the naked rambler upwards of what people aren't allowed to wear either by society or law, and claim they were all examples of repression. Is it more repressive to stop someone wearing a yellow star or not? At what point does one stop asserting that society will have to revolve around oneself instead of making a few small concessions that won't really affect one in any way at all?

&gt;The answer to men restricting women's rights is to stop the men doing it, not restrict women's rights even further.

Who said it would be a decision by men? And where did 'even further' come from?

&amp;nbsp;

Nigel Farage MEP, said ""If you have a country, in which the population goes up, as a direct result of immigration"" then proceeded to say there are not enough school places and that we have fewer GP's per head than any other country in Europe today.""

&amp;nbsp;

So I did some research and it turns out that this was published in a EU health report this year. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since 2000, the number of physicians per capita has increased in all European countries, except in France where it has remained stable.

&amp;nbsp;

On average across EU member states, physician density increased from 2.9 doctors per 1 000 population in 2000 to 3.4 in 2012. The rise in the number of doctors per capita was particularly rapid in Greece, but most of the growth occurred before the economic crisis started in 2008.

&amp;nbsp;

The growth rate has also been very strong in the United Kingdom, which started from the second lowest level in 2000, thereby narrowing the gap with other EU countries.

&amp;nbsp;

In the United Kingdom, there were over 10% more employed doctors in 2012 compared with 2008. Looking at the entire period from 2000 to 2012, there were 50% more doctors in the United Kingdom in 2012 compared with 2000.

&amp;nbsp;

The fact is that yes the UK has a low number of doctors, but we are not the lowest in Europe, and there are more doctors in the UK now than there ever has been.

&amp;nbsp;

In 2012, the United Kingdom had 2.8 practising physicians per 1000 population, up from 2.0 in 2000
We have more doctors per head than the USA, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.

&amp;nbsp;

I think the figures speak for themselves, practising physicians per 1000 population has nothing to do with immigration or over crowding as we have more doctors per head now, than we have ever had.

You don't get rich by giving your money to other people. 

You get rich by taking more for yourself than it cost you to make, and then sitting on it. 

Then you get to the point where most people don't have enough money to pay you any more, and your income dries up. 

This is such a fundamental problem that we had to invent interest as a concept in order to give people money again (both for starting businesses and private consumption). The trouble with that is it means you're taking more money back than you first gave, so in the long run you're actually draining the public supply even further. 

A neat way around this is to agree that the things people bought with the money you lent them are worth more now, so they can pay you back in full and still be liquid (or at least, have a net gain). You can even lend them more now as they have more value to guarantee your money against, and so on.

Unfortunately, that agreement is quite fragile; if in the process of repayment they run out of money and try to liquidise their ""assets"", there's a risk that the assumed value is not the actual value, and then they can't pay you back and the assets they have aren't worth it to you either. If this happens to a lot of people, then the agreed value is clearly exposed as false and suddenly everyone realises why they didn't buy this stuff to begin with - because they didn't have the money for it - so no one can buy anything again and values as a whole plummet, but now everyone is worse off than before because you've also got this interest concept which means you've agreed they owe you more money than you put in to begin with. Even worse, some of that money you gave them was derived from the assumption that because everyone owed you more money than you gave out you had more money to lend out again. So now you don't have any money either! Where has it gone? 

Oh, shit, and here we are in 2014.

&gt;

&gt;The __ARA__ ___General Belgrano___ was an [Argentine Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Navy) [light cruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser_(warship\)) in service from 1951 until 1982. Previously named [USS *Phoenix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Phoenix_(CL-46\)), she saw action in the [Pacific theatre of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War) before being sold to Argentina. The vessel was the second to have been named after the Argentine [founding father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_fathers) [Manuel Belgrano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Belgrano) (1770–1820). The first vessel was a 7,069-ton [armoured cruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_cruiser) completed in 1899.

&gt;After almost 31 years of service, she was sunk during the [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War) ([Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language): *Guerra de Malvinas or Guerra del Atlántico Sur*) by the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) submarine [*Conqueror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Conqueror_(S48\)) with the loss of 323 lives. Losses from *General Belgrano* totalled just over half of Argentine deaths in the war.

&gt;She is the only ship ever to have been sunk during military operations by a nuclear-powered submarine  and the second sunk in action by any type of submarine since World War II, the first being the Indian frigate [INS *Khukri*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Khukri_(1958\)) by the Pakistani *[Hangor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNS_Hangor_(S131\))* during the [1971 Indo-Pakistani War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Indo-Pakistani_War). The sinking of *General Belgrano* was highly controversial in both the United Kingdom and Argentina at the time and remains so to this day.

I don't know where people live but unless it's in the Outer Hebrides, you cannot say that this country isn't crowded. Myself along with millions of others sit in traffic everyday often for hours on end. 30 years ago when I left school I commuted to London from Morden at the end of the Northern Line and got a seat every day. Now I often have to watch several trains go before I steal myself to squeeze on. There's lots more trains but there are so many more people. The underground stations are a joke, people literally packed in yet with trains every couple of minutes. I'm quite sure that there's no more room in the system to cope with it because those in control would be milking it. Fact is capacity was reached a decade ago. They widen the roads, we get bigger jams.

I have to wait often 3 days to get a doctors appointment. My local doctors expanded 3 fold into a much bigger building with all the new systems but it's total gridlock in there. Doctors get literally minutes with each person. Same at the dentist, same in my kids school. 90 kids in the infants this year, in 1990 there were 16. Same at the local shopping mall; I queue up to get in, queue up for every shop I go into to pay, queue up to eat, queue up to get out. Going shopping is an ordeal that I never had to deal with 15 years ago. So much time wasted just waiting about, how anyone makes any money in a business that relies on the infrastructure of this country I don't know.

I had some friends come from Spain to stay and they were simply gobsmacked at how rammed we are. You can invest shit loads more but it just fills up again within a few years. It's unsustainable, it's detrimental to our quality of life, it destroys communities. A plan needs to be put in place that takes into consideration all of those things not just how much more money immigrants will bring. If they are also eroding so many other aspects of life then it needs to be properly controlled. This is without even addressing the problem with culture and religion that further dilutes our experience as British people. I don't want to have to be concerned or have regard for all the different people who come here, I just want to live my life like I'm sure we all do without having stuff rammed down my throat or have to make special exceptions for those who choose to come here because they like wearing funny hats or don't like our food.

There are 10 million more people here now than when I was born and most of those are where I live and work in and around London and the home counties. Net migration is also over double the birth and death rate. Projections are for 10 million by 2025, that's only 10 years away and in case no one had noticed it's already completely fucked!

&gt;and thinking that these poor women don't know any better and need to be compelled to remove it because they don't know what's best for them is not a good enough reason to ban it.

Again, your words not mine. See?

&gt;And by christ, 'because I don't want to talk to someone covering their face' is an even worse reason to make something illegal.

Actually, it's *people* that don't like having to deal with someone who covers their face. This isn't something that's gone on for centuries in the UK and we've suddenly decided we don't like it. I worked in Whitechapel for ten years (up until about 2000) which already had a huge Blangladeshi/ Pakistani population, and even then you might see one person wearing this kind of thing *per day*. Instead of ignoring the background, why not explain the reasoning for wearing one in the first place, as I asked before?

&gt;What's stopping you just asking them to remove it if you want to talk?

What's stopping them from taking it off permanently? Again, why does the whole of society have to alter instead? It doesn't work like that.

I would advise against it, houses are not liquid might be hard to sell when you need to and you forgo flexibility of selling it when the time is right. Also neither of you will be able to buy the other one out.

Consequentially we need less GPs. That's the only reason for the discrepancy, since GPs here actually get paid very well compared to European counterparts. 

I haven't watched the video but if Farage is making the claim that our healthcare is worse than one provided by other European countries purely because we have less GPs per head then it's an incredibly disingenuous argument, and it's quite blatantly nit-picking  a ""shocking"" sounding statistic when the reality is much more complicated.

You have to read what they say literally. The key fragment is ""no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition"".

&gt;___Deus ex machina___ (Latin: [ˈdeus eks ˈmaː.kʰi.naː]: /ˈdeɪ.əs ɛks ˈmɑːkiːnə/ or /ˈdiːəs ɛks ˈmækɨnə/;  plural: *dei ex machina*) is a [plot device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device) whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object. Depending on how it is done, it can be intended to move the story forward when the writer has ""painted himself into a corner"" and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [happy ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_ending), or as a comedic device.

BR will get nothing from FSG apart from player sales I'd assume, and by selling Borini we could possibly get Begovic. 

Selling Borini would mean we have no money for transfers and only three strikers (two without Sturridge). We definitely need four strikers and Torres simply represents the best transfer for the funds we could possibly use. 

Torres is also a former fan favourite and although he's been dire the last few years he'd be fine for cover and a better first choice than Lambert simply due to the fact that we can't play with Lambert starting. He offers simply nothing in our build up - he's a target man.

Can you clarify a little on the final ownership?  If you put in 50k to start and he puts in 10k you won't end up with an equal split afterwards even if you share the mortgage payments.  So how will you account for interest and overpayments?

Maybe an example would help:

A 250k place will cost £1000 a month mortgage (or there abouts, numbers for ease, not accuracy...).

So on month one, you pay £1000 total, £500 each.  Does that mean you each own half of whatever is left afterwards?  Also, about half the payment will be interest, so do you now own 50500 ""shares"" of the house (since you paid £500 and 50k deposit) OR do you own 50250 shares as the first 250 you paid was all interest?

Also, you need to consider:  The expenses of buying a selling:  Do you split them 50:50 or are they taken from the proceeds of the sale?  Right now, if you do the former, your both effectively starting with a negative amount of shares since you need about £3k in cash to pay for buying but if you do it the second way, you are paying a higher share of the fees than your friend (like 5:1 dropping to about 3:1 as time passes)

The other thing to consider is how will you split expenses as you go?

&gt; To the degree that it is a purely scientific debate, the evidence of black superiority in athletics is persuasive and decisively confirmed on the playing field. Elite athletes who trace most or all of their ancestry to Africa are by and large better than the competition. The performance gap is widest when little expensive equipment or facilities are required, such as running, the only true intentional sport, and in widely played team sports such as basketball and football. Blacks not only outnumber their nonwhite competitors but, by and large, are the superstars. 

This [other article at Popular Social Science](http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2013/01/21/why-blacks-are-good-at-sports/) suggests some of the reasons;
&gt; The facts show that East Africans own every distance running record. In most of the sports people of African descendant dominate. Why have black people dominated sports? Are they somehow physically better? Research shows that it is not just being black that matters. Where in Africa your ancestors come from makes the huge difference.

&gt; Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. White people dominate sports that require expensive equipment, such as golf, sailing, hockey, etc. And, just as “white men can’t jump”, it is also the case that “black men can’t swim.”  One of the reasons for the latter fact is that black people have denser skeletons and lower levels of body fat, a physical trait inherited from the tropical areas of Africa.

&gt; In the U.S., sports are dominated by men and women of West African descent. The same reason, namely the low body fat, provides blacks of West-African origin with an advantage in sprinting, as well as in football and basketball. When it comes to long distance running, East-Africans excel due to their lack of a fully developed Gastrocnemius, also known as the lower calf muscle.

the mind whilst sleeping generally is a playground for subconscious thoughts to gather and take shape. during the time that you are describing you were grieving and vulnerable, and thus sought some sort of friendship and companionship.

""Science of the mind is in it's infancy but some evidence such as the success of remote viewing and the persistence of events such as my own cant be ignored by science.""

it has not been ignored. there are perfectly reasonable explanations. Homo-sapiens are emotional and social beings and thus we crave companionship. I will however admit that i do not know enough about remote viewing to comment.

you could ask r/science as i thing this has been covered before

It doesn't make him a bad footballer - he's proven in the last month or so that he's still a very solid and reliable centre-back.

What really is the big deal? Seriously now. We've already ascertained that the whole 'symbol of oppression' schtick is not the main point, as you said yourself you wouldn't ban the turban or the hijab. This means that the face-covering-in-public aspect is your main problem.  I don't see people getting up in arms about balaclavas, morph suits, football mascots, or walking down the street in a motorcycle helmet. 

&gt;What's stopping them from taking it off permanently? Again, why does the whole of society have to alter instead? It doesn't work like that.

Why should they be forced to take it off permanently? Who does it harm? Who's rights does it infringe? What is so devastating to one's ability to live peacefully about somebody wearing a veil in public that simply asking them to remove it if they can't understand them talk is not enough, and instead requires a nationwide prohibition with fines and jail sentences to those who flout it?

If society does indeed have that big a problem with it, then it absolutely has to alter. It's not the niqab-wearer's problem that you personally (and 'people') just can't deal with someone committing the offence of standing on the pavement with their face covered while doing absolutely nothing.

This was posted by someone else.

I think I can answer this one as a med student. GPs in many countries around Europe have a somewhat different role than ones in this country. In general, our GPs tend to be far less important and in almost all cases, subsequent healthcare will be provided by specialists. Whereas in other countries the GP will remain an active care-giver. Consequentially we need less GPs. That's the only reason for the discrepancy, since GPs here actually get paid very well compared to European counterparts.

I haven't watched the video but if Farage is making the claim that our healthcare is worse than one provided by other European countries purely because we have less GPs per head then it's an incredibly disingenuous argument, and it's quite blatantly nit-picking a ""shocking"" sounding statistic when the reality is much more complicated.


Also I think you are missing the point.

The point is that Farage has said we have the lowest due to immigration, while the figures suggest we actually have more since the borders opened. The point of where we rank compared to Europe, arguably has nothing to do with immigration.",0,1418398426,null,0,false,0,cmsv27r,t3_2p2owb,t1_cmsv27r,t1_cmsuyu1,null,1425468732,-8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-8
false,vcbnxn,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk,"This article does not mention any impact on dashcams or ""filming the pigeons"". The issue is **sustained monitoring** with an intent to process data. A key phrase quoted from the European regulations is:

&gt; ...by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity

This is to be expected. I work in computer vision, surveillance is a popular topic, I'm not sure about wider laws since it's not my area, but I know if someone want to setup a surveillance experiment it's standard to seek ethics approval.

This is because CCTV is expected to have certain limitations on retention and is covered by data protection laws.

It's unclear from the article but this:

&gt; The court decided Ryneš was not liable for a fine because he had acted to help prosecute a criminal. However, the judgment suggested that if a crime had not been committed he would have breached European data regulations. The directive has an exception in the case of data processing carried out “by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity”, but the court found that the exception would not always apply if a camera is recording images of a public space such as a footpath.

Makes me think that the argument may have been the fact that he kept this personal data (the video) beyond a reasonable timeframe, but the ruling was made in his favour because the data remained pertinent due to being evidence.

I think there needs to be clearer legislation on residential use. I'm all for home CCTV systems, but I would not want people actively monitoring public areas, or other residences in a neighbourhood - which could quickly become an issue.

I'm not saying people wouldn't let them swim or somehow suggest they wouldn't be good at it, but that poorer and richer schools offer different sporting activities to their students, as do inner-city schools versus small towns or suburbs, and schools in different regions. While the racial ancestry of students within these schools isn't relevant to what they pursue, I think it's fair to say that the ratio of black students to white students is much higher in poor inner-city schools in the south of the UK than it is in rich suburban, rurual, or private schools in the north.

It's not that there's some kind of segregation, just that sports can be split up along socio-economic/income grounds just as well as race, and to ignore how that might affect young people's sporting prospects in this country is probably a mistake.

To simplify: compare London schools with those in Newcastle. I suspect the sports offered and the support for those sports is different in each place. For instance, hypothetically, basketball is available to students in London but not rugby, and vice versa in Newcastle. That means that more students in London will do basketball, and some will do very well. In Newcastle, more will play rugy, and some will do very well.

Now, there is also proportionally much more diversity in racial ancestry amongst students in London than there is in Newcastle. When these students finish school and possibly pursue sporting careers, there will be a lot more white people playing rugby than basketball.

However, while most of us saw the UCL exit coming, the thing is we all believe that we never should've been in a position for it to happen in the first place.  It is not just that one result, it's the 3 wins in our last **twelve** games and general lack of impetus to make any kind of change or experiment with a formula that is very obviously not working to try and improve results.  The demeanor of the manager and of most of the players has been poor, and it's embarrassing to see.  The quality of football as been absolutely awful, it's dull, boring, and uninventive.  If we were losing hard fought games with encouraging displays no one would be nearly as upset as they are right now.

The summer window was a disaster and didn't properly cover us in the problems with the squad, nor did it accomplish the most important possible goal of finding an attacker to allow us to continue to play our way post-Suarez.

No it doesn't, and remember the NSA already track most of us through Google, MS, Apple and Facebook services.

On the paper our strongest midfield feels like Capoue and Dembele, but between Capoue's form and Dembele's laziness I just don't see that happening. Mason and Bentaleb have both been good because they seem to give a shit no matter what, but neither of them quite have the defensive aspect that Capoue offered at the beginning of the season.

I wouldn't mind having another go at Schneiderlin in the summer, and we have an abundance of quality CMs. We should be looking at shipping some of them out, but Mason has been more than satisfactory for a large part of the season and we have an unpolished diamond in Bentaleb. Bentaleb should be playing as much as he can, because that's the best way to really develop him, in my opinion.

Dembele hasn't convinced me this season.

If you look at government figures for benefit fraud (you know, official verifiable sources of information instead of the Daily Star) for that year that the UKIP policy document was published, the figure for fraud for incapacity benefit was 0.3%! For Disability Living Allowance it was 0.5%! Does that sound like the sort of amounts you would think reflected the pages and pages of anecdotes and sensationalism stirring up a frenzy and suspicion towards people with disabilities? (Incapacity benefit here is included because it is often the first port of call for someone who becomes disabled before able to claim DLA which is a longer process).

While sigurdsson can adjust his game later in his career, building more muscle mass and laying further back. Or maybe as a striker like he was early in his career.

They can appeal using human rights reasons for allowing the visa.

Additionally, you can't claim benefits anyway, they grant the visa with  restrictions stating both the visa holder and their family are not entitled to any state benefits, or government support, so saying it's to ensure that they don't use government resources is a bit of a cop out.

You have one that you can slip into the conversation and you've been pounding it like all your other brethren on this forum and, no doubt, others. 

A)[ FGM isn't a Muslim phenomena](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/muslim-youth-summit-fgm-islam-gambia). It's virtually unheard of in South Asia and the majority of Muslims in the UK are South Asian - which you handily pointed out yourselves.  [The women leading the fight against it in Somali communities are, in the majority, hijab wearing muslims](http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2014/feb/24/fgm-malala-yousafzai-supports-guardian-campaign-video)

B) The prevalence of unemployment in communities is usually a sign of unemployment in the local area. People in Bradford or Rotherham aren't unemployed because they're Muslim or  Mirpuri. They're unemployed because there's no opportunity in the local area.  Why is this .. because YOUR boo boys on the right encouraged the dismantling of local industry and the destruction of local services. Your pal Eric Pickles was  responsible for nuking Bradford's services in the 80s condemning the whole area to collapse. Leeds didn't do that. Leeds recovered much better. 

C) the consanguineous marriage thing is all about racism Considering the Queen married her cousin, and you're no doubt a royalist - but when brown people are involved - ohh bad. It's go nothing to do with science. For example in Small, Neil. (""Infant mortality and migrant health in babies of Pakistani origin born in Bradford, UK."" Journal of Intercultural Studies 33.5 (2012): 549-564. ) - prevalence of certain recessive genes is lower than other populations, and is higher in Sheridan, Eamonn, et al. (""Risk factors for congenital anomaly in a multiethnic birth cohort: an analysis of the Born in Bradford study."" The Lancet 382.9901 (2013): 1350-1359.)

There's another way of identifying that you're not really interested in Science, you're trying to push an easy narrative - why aren't you that upset about Tay-Sachs (Levene, Sara. ""4 Communicating with Clients from the Jewish Community."" Getting the Message Across: Communication with Diverse Populations in Clinical Genetics (2013): 4.)

If you're SO bothered about the welfare of children - why aren't you campaigning for Hasidic Jews and their marriages. We all know why.. you know you can't get away with anti-semitism, but you can target South Asians as Muslims. 

As for the grooming figures - when you don't have the prospect of a potential [11 million victims](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/08/child-sex-abuse-national-health-epidemic-11-million-victims) abused by the British establishment  then you can talk.. otherwise .. sod off to /r/pol with your ""analysis""

[From here:](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Time_of_the_Doctor_%28TV_story%29)

**As the Daleks begin their attack, however, a new, much larger crack appears in the night sky, apparently unnoticed by all but the Doctor. Golden energy emanates out of the crack and enters the Doctor's mouth. The Doctor's eyes widen in surprise as he realises what the Time Lords have just done, and his mood completely turns over when he sees his hands glowing with the all-too familiar force that has saved him from death twelve times before: the Doctor has been granted a new cycle of regenerations.**

In ""Kill the moon"" There's a point where the doctor is threatened by the Captain of the human mission, his response to her threat is to say that if she kills her he'll keep regenerating, and that even he doesn't know how many times that might happen, it could be forever, as he might not be limited to a run of 12 this time.

Wanted a cool car, mission accomplished until the bloody thing burst into flames a year later. It was also expensive to keep on the road, naturally.

Wouldn't bother these days, it seems like a waste. I found a 16-year old MGF for about £650 and that thing is the most fun car I've ever owned. It's a bonkers little machine, I can't imagine why I'd want to drop tons of money on another car. Cheap to buy, cheap to run, cheap to insure, surprisingly good MPG, fast, the engine note under acceleration is glorious (in part thanks to a previous owner installing an induction kit) but nice and quiet pootling around town.

I still want him back though, because I'm a huge Torres fan and I really don't think he can make things worse.

No, that's not even what I said. 

I said change is incremental, and to work towards a better world we must take baby steps and try not to disadvantage anyone too much with each step. 

I have something called perspective. 

I realise that regardless of our societies problems we still live in one of the best countries in the world. Top 20 easily, top 10 most likely. 

That's pretty good going given there's about 180 odd countries in the world. We're not doing to bad in the grand scheme of things. 

We can do better, but I don't think we should risk that top 10 place for the possibility of a top 5 place. Especially not when there's a very real chance it could end with us only getting a top 50 place. 

Radical change isn't the answer. Incremental steps to a better future for all is, and unfortunately if you attempt big political change in a country that is at the top of its game globally you're going to come up against strong resistance from all those people like me with perspective.

Sturridge - Definitely not. 

Balo - depends on which Balo decides to turn up on the day, at his best he is better than Torres at his worst I'd much rather have Torres, at least you'll know what to expect with Torres. 

Any other striker we have is worse than Torres.

In my current house we have deliberately kept everything really close, therefore the shower is hot within seconds.  Ironically the kitchen tap is close to the boiler but the pipe run goes up, across, down, then round so it takes longer to get water.

At our last house one bathroom was at the opposite end of the house to the boiler and it wasted two gallons of water before getting hot.  This couls also happen with an immersion heater in the airing cupboard though.

My current showers have a 10"" shower heads, unlimited hot water, and are without doubt the best I've ever had.

Tax evasion is easy. EVERYBODY is against tax evasion, even the Tories. Curtailing the power of the rich though? How? he never elaborates what this power is or gives case examples of how it affects us.

To be honest, I feel bad hating on Brand, because he's obviously a thoroughly good person (if extremely arrogant). But he just has no credibility, and he is damaging the left.

I'm very blue labour. Think Tony Blair without the evil (if you can). I've seen my political wing become infested with champagne socialist theorists and political fashionistas. I hate that.

The fact that people like Ed Milliband (un-democratically elected, dreadful statesman), or Diane Abbot (Horrendous racist, genuinely most ignorant politician I know of) are key figures in this party gets my goat.

Milliband's career has been coddled and supported at every step. Farage's political career was forged in the fires of political protest, and he has managed to temper his support base into permanent and stable platform. His supporters are all highly disaffected by the previous labour gov'ts choices, and the coalitions failure to mitigate their effects. This means Farage cannot afford to pull punches, and thats just good politics.

That makes millions of people in poverty, people who live paycheck to paycheck if they get a check at all. People who, by the standards of the median, live on the line of barely surviving.

If you're truly advocating reducing everyone's standard of living, then you're doing that to 10 million plus people who are already in poverty.

If what you're advocating is more income equality, I'm right behind you. But everyone taking a hit makes the worst off now much worse off, and the richest still... Pretty damn rich.

Considering that the ONS has shown repeatedly that immigrants make up a much larger chunk of those in poverty than the rest of the population, they're not exactly taking from anyone. In fact they'd be one of the groups you might end up protecting from destitution.

Reading comprehension comes into play for the next part. 

The article is about how the tribunal have decided that the husband (the British citizen's spouse in this article) will be deported under the updated laws/rules require the British citizen to meet a specific annual income. 

As it stands there is a ruling, that has survived at least one appeal, that the wife's salary is not sufficient under these new rules. 

&gt; The couple now have 14 days to seek permission to appeal against the ruling.

After the 14 days have passed and the ruling is not overturned, the husband (a spouse of a British citizen) will be required to leave the country. 

Now it doesn't state he is now being deported and here are the photos of him handcuffed and being escorted to the plane. 

But that's why I said it takes reading comprehension to understand that the husband (spouse of a British citizen) faces deportation. As stated in the BBC article. 

I do hope they're successful on appeal after this has received public attention. Or maybe the family gets some pro-Bono help from a good immigration lawyer wanting free publicity.

I've unfortunately come to the conclusion it doesn't really matter who we put on the pitch as they're all about equivalent of each other.  In my opinion we don't have a clear starting 11 because we have about 18-20 players who are all good, but really none of them are really that much better than any of the others so which of the 11 you put out is a bit irrelevant.

Doesn't matter, they're all about the same level.  Sakho, Skrtel, Toure, or Lovren?  Doesn't really make much difference.

Journal of Intercultural Studies 33.5 (2012): 549-564. ) - prevalence of certain recessive genes is lower than other populations, and in Sheridan, Eamonn, et al. (""Risk factors for congenital anomaly in a multiethnic birth cohort: an analysis of the Born in Bradford study."" The Lancet 382.9901 (2013): 1350-1359.)

Did you read that Lancet study?

&gt;Rates of infant death are highest in children of Pakistani origin, and congenital anomalies are the most common cause of death in children younger than 12 in this ethnic group.

&gt;Consanguinity is a major risk factor for congenital anomaly. The risk remains even after adjustment for deprivation, and accounts for almost a third of anomalies in babies of Pakistani origin.

false,Blubbey,null,null,"&gt;In 2012-13, Villas-Boas’s lone full season as Spurs boss, the team gave up the fewest shots in the Premier League and conceded the third-fewest expected goals

And yet the only thing that matters at the end of the day is goals conceded, more than likely going to be 6th-8th. 

&gt;Of course, that defense was tied to an uninventive attack that relied on Gareth Bale’s magic to produce goals. Once the Welshman departed, Villas-Boas couldn’t adjust, six months later he was out the door as well, and Spurs became a muddled rudderless ship subject to the tactical whims of interim-in-all-but-name manager Tim Sherwood.

Huh, he says that and of course he likes his stats (expected goals,  bit open ended) so why doesn't he give Sherwood credit for what he did?

27 points in 16 games for AVB (1.6875/game), 15 scored (0.94) 21 (1.31) conceded.

42 points in 22 games for Sherwood (1.909/game), 40 goals for (1.81), 30 (1.36) conceded.

Compared to AVB's previous season with Bale:

72 points in 38 (1.89), 66/46 (1.74/1.21)

For a team ""subject to Sherwood's tactical whims"" they sure didn't do badly.

&gt;And yet at Spurs, with a roster that was, in theory, assembled to play his preferred style

I don't know where that comes from/what he's using to support that. I don't particularly remember any pressing, maybe Lennon but other than that?

&gt;Additionally, Sandro the Fragile Monster is gone. When healthy enough to get on the field, Sandro was one of the best defensive midfielders in the game. 

Hate to break it to you, but compare the scores and lineups against City and Liverpool for Sherwood and AVB. Notice the difference of no Sandro for Sherwood ([5-1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25838298), [4-0](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26703761)) v AVB's inclusion of Sandro and losing [6-0](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24976958) and [5-0](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25287554). Sandro isn't a ""stick him in there you'll guarantee fewer goals conceded"" option.

&gt;In the attacking third under Villas-Boas, Spurs would often field a more defensive-minded midfielder like Paulinho, Dembélé, or the now-sold Lewis Holtby 

wat. He's by far the most attack minded central midfielder we've had for a while. He wants to surge into the box, he wants to make the extra man. Remember [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24098608) [goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biM7vjZeBA)? How often has Dembele done that? I can't remember a central midfielder that's scored that much in a season for this club for a while now. That's about what Modric would score in 2 seasons and Dembele has only scored half of what Paulinho has (4 goals in 2 seasons).

&gt;Villas-Boas sidelined Érik Lamela almost immediately after he arrived

Injuries wasn't it?

&gt;The good news for Spurs is that they have a whole bunch of young, talented players and a young, talented coach. The bad news is that those pieces don’t necessarily fit together, and there’s no apparent, easy path toward fixing that

I'd much rather see this.  Yes Sterling and Markovic are not out and out strikers. But do we have anyone who has shown as much intent as them? 

To be honest I'd rather have Lallana in Stevies position and Stevie in Can's position. But, seeing as Lallana has 2 broken ribs I'd keep him out. I believe Stevie can provide Raheem and Lazar with the right type of service in that role behind the 2 attackers. Some may argue he doesn't have the legs to do this for 90 minutes and I would probably agree. Maybe Rodgers might need to use a sub for once.

It certainly looks from the ratings that anyone speaking against the homophobic religious zealot in this thread gets down-rated.

The ""down-raters"" (is that a thing?) demonstrably don't have a rational intelligent argument that would win the debate (if they had one, they'd post it and clearly win the debate hands down) instead they act like petulant children sulking, and being spiteful/petty at every chance.

ITT:The spiteful homophobia rooted in Catholicism *is* the dominant feature.

Well, that's how it looks to me ...

People try to associate their causes with him if they can and he is a regular fixture at left-wing marches in London. I don't think it's fashionable to be cynical of him. 

I think the statements he makes are simplistic and superficial. Yes there is inequality in the UK and it needs to be addressed but beyond that he offers little substantive argument on the causes of the problems, it's not always bankers, or the solutions. Every time he is challenged he makes a joke, changes the issue or goes after the person who challenged him. Look at last night where he kept trying to direct the question into an attack on Farage. Brand is a lightweight and he is awful at debating and awful if he is challenged. His only effective medium is broadcasting not engaging. If he can speak without anyone challenging his views then he is happy otherwise he is out of his depth. It's because his ideas don't hold up to it. 

&gt;  People really enjoy sneering at 'both sides' as if they are sat above it all, the only sensible moderate.

This isn't a game. You don't have to choose a side. Moderation is a underrated quality. I don't think it's sneering at both sides. It's being able to criticise someone irrespective of what side they are on. The problem with Farage and Brand is they're disingenuous populists that exploit wider cynicism and disaffection with the political system to promote themselves and their flawed ideas (such as they are).

Brand looks bad in parts because he isn't an expert in capitalist economics. Neither, however, is anyone on that panel. The thing I wish people would realise about this kind of show and those kind of panellists is that they are trained from a very young age to speak to middle income people that engage in politics. That doesn't mean they know anything it means they *look good*. Brand doesn't have that training, he has the ability to make people laugh. Dropping a normally educated person in that situation is exactly the same as dropping a comprehensive school kid in a class at Eton. It doesn't matter how smart the kid is, they won't know how to behave around the other kids.

On to the actual, loaded question that was answered by nobody except with the format of window dressing.
Is Britain over crowded? My answer - who the fuck cares?  Now I know you might think ""I care, immigration is killing us"" but I bet you're not a racist so you don't really care specifically about migrants or anyone else - you care about your wage packet and the quality of your public services.

Immigration doesn't matter to people (except in the case of genuine wages), what matters is that wage growth has stagnated and public services are being put under pressure.
Immigrant labour is one of many mechanisms used to do this, but cutting the level of immigration will do nothing to solve the underlying issues facing ordinary people (including immigrants) today.

The objective of businesses is make as much profit as possible - this is their function, if they don't do this they will disappear. The consequence is that they will look for mechanisms to reduce their labour bill whilst still producing the same amount of goods or services. A small list of ways that they can do this is as follows, this is far from comprehensive but it should give you an idea:

* Export jobs over seas where labour is dirt cheap.
* Remove the collective bargaining power of workers - if workers can't fight for a 2% pay rise then you don't have to give it to them.
* Start schemes that increase the number of potential workers in a given field (e.g. interpret ""we need more engineers in this country"" as ""*on average, engineers are paid significantly more than the average worker, hurting our profits*"")
* Automation - everyone loves to talk about this one because its bleeding obvious. What people don't talk about is how firms will only invest in automation if it is cheaper than the cost of labour, otherwise they'll just add more labourers (why would tesco buy an automated checkout if they could employ workers at £1 an hour?).
* Move labourers to this country to increase competition in the jobs market.

You see, if we remove or reduce immigration we might increase wages ever so slightly, but there are a huge number of other issues that would still make it shit to be working.

People might say ""ahh but when companies make more money they grow and then create jobs, that will make pay go up but its stopped because of immigrants over flooding the job market"" but it really doesn't matter whether its immigrants, moving work overseas or robots becoming cheaper - its that because people aren't earning as much money, so they aren't spending as much. For about 30 years this issue was avoided, pushed down, with the advent of cheap credit.
This went kaput and caused lots of people to loose their jobs (and worse, rich people to loose fortunes!) so nobody is keen on this any more.
Reducing migrants won't increase our pay though - not a chance, businesses don't want to hurt profits to help the whole system, that would be madness to them.
So we're stuck - unless we have a collective movement or a political force that demands that businesses increase wages we're not going to see pay going up regardless of the number of migrant workers.

The thing is, when you start questioning these things you start questioning the underlying economic system and maybe start to construct something a bit different, that is the last thing the cheerleaders for capitalism (UKIP, Labour, Conservatives) want.",0,1418412516,null,0,false,0,cmt2lvf,t3_2p19q3,t1_cmt2lvf,t3_2p19q3,null,1425465141,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I'm not sure he does represent anything different to the greens..


But thinking about it I'm really *not* really sure what the green's manifesto is TBH, they chirp up on environmental issues like windfarms etc, but I have no idea what their policy would be relating to the relationship between Govt and corporations, what level of taxation we should have, what sort of safety net should society give to the weak and vulnerable, what about the privatisation of the NHS (that seems to be progressing by stealth at the moment), how do they plan to fill the big black hole in state pensions etc etc etc???

RB's presentation is (for me at least) easier to follow, and he certainly has a lot less connotation of duffle-coats and eating lentils etc than the green party do.

Maybe the greens should get him on board (If his ideas are compatible of course) even if it's just as a spokesperson? He'd certainly get people's attention more than the greens do at the moment.

IMO the problem with British politics in recent years (decades?) is mass apathy (that I believe has been actively encouraged by politicians as it lets them do as they will) on the part of the public.

Brand irrefutably has the ability to engage people in what is ultimately the way they are going to be living their lives in years to come (albeit in a very ""Marmite"" way, but engagement is good the more people involved in improving society and life the better, isn't it?). 

In recent history the faces, and the colour of the ties is the only thing that has changed in politics in the UK, *all* the main parties clearly have corporate interests far above the voters' in priority.

Proof of this is the fact that Osborn took £80 billion in Austerity taxes/cuts and gave it to the bankers who then spent £81 billion in bonuses.

Every penny taken off the public went into the bankers bonuses, not to fix any black hole in the economy.

Those schools that didn't get built/improved, those people laid off, the services taken away from the elderly and vulnerable oh, and not lets forget the demonisation of the disabled and the unemployed like it's *their* fault the market collapsed (it's certainly no surprise that a Ponzi scheme ultimately goes broke is it?)...

They must be laughing their fucking arses off.

**None** of the parties/politicians are kicking up about this (the party whip probably forbids it) and none of them want to find their snout has been shoved out of the trough for tackling what is at the end of all the prevarication, and distraction we are fed week after week, month after month, year after year, by these avaricious sycophants of the corporations; the corporations whose bribes (in the form of the guarantee of a well paid seat on the board after retirement from politics) buy them their influence in Govt, national and foreign policy, and they thereby gain the freedom to do exactly as they please.

If that's *not* rampant corruption, what is?

And if anyone thinks voting for people already on that treadmill of graft and corruption is going to change anything (other than the colour of the party badge and tie of the guy dictating how the UK public live their lives) they are kidding themselves

United Kingdon

population 61.13 million

Ecological foot print in global hectares per capita. 4.89

Biocapacity in global hectares per capita 1.34

Ecological remainder in global hectares per capita. -3.55

making the UK the top20 of the least sustainable countries in the world
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint
What does it mean?

The UK is currently using about 3 times as much of resources than it has.
For a sustainable economy on the current standard of living the UK would have to

A) add some land and resources to its shores increasing it's size and resources threefold.

OR

B) decrease population by 73%

OR

C) decrease the standard of living by 73% (so getting to the living standard of Sri Lanka)

OR

D) constantly rob other countries of their resources. Take 3 pounds worth of goods and giving them back only 1

what we are currently seeing is not A. We see the opposite of B (increasing population) we see C for the average bloke and D. But even so that's not enough so what is actually happening is that the current population is living off the resources of the future generation it's basically robbing their children and grandchildren of a good life.",0,1418416157,null,0,false,0,cmt4lq1,t3_2p2eqn,t1_cmt4lq1,t3_2p2eqn,null,1425464198,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Noone smiles to each other on the street and if you start a conversation with a stranger they act like you're some kind of pervert.

This is so not true. I've met some lovely people on the streets and in the tube. Everyone's always up for a good laugh. Sure there will be some pessimists walking around who think all social interaction is a sin, but the large majority are always willing to have a chat.

I didn't know that, but I'm not really into raves and stuff anyways. As a rock and football enthusiast, London is great because of all the big concerts and matches.

But beyond that, its not just about entertainment. From a professional perspective, the connectivity that we have here with the business, legal, and political sectors can be a huge advantage.

I do like life in small towns, when I visited Oxford it was very pleasant. However, I would honestly get sooo bored after a few months. In my opinion you can always move to a small and quiet place later on in life, but a big city like London is best enjoyed when you're young and energetic.

Definitely agree with the gender difference too.

My understanding is that courier drivers don't necessarily *have* to return to the depot at the end of the day. If they are owner drivers they can drive to the depot (or their own drop box) fill up their van, do their deliveries, and go straight home. So, unfortunately, this means they are incentivised (if the parcel doesn't require a signature of course) to just 'dump and run' in the hope that they'll be able to empty their van. The system is undoubtably broken, but, well, here we are.


I realise this info is probably no comfort at all and you're understandably raging at the inconvenience of it all - but seriously, look into Collect+ in future, it takes all the anxiety out of ordering stuff online.

I genuinely wonder if the fact people have to pay is placing more people at risk of complications through asthma thanks to a reluctance to get it treated.

false,GnikN17,null,null,"I think 4-3-3 suits us better too, with proper wingers high up the pitch and Eriksen sat a bit deeper I think we'd be more effective. If we sell Dembele and Paulinho, that would leave us with Bentaleb, Capoue, Stambouli and Mason for the deeper central midfield positions and I'd like Holtby and Carroll to join if they want to come back. 

The problem with this is we only have Eriksen as a proper creative midfielder with no cover. Holtby and Carroll coming into the mix could solve this problem, or maybe an academy player can step up (I'm thinking Winks, Ceballos or Pritchar. Anyone know how good they are?).

I know taking Eriksen further from goal means he'll probably score less but he plays well in a deeper position and would have more space to operate in if our traditional wingers stretching the game. Townsend on the left and Lennon on the right wouldn't maximise the amount of talent we have on the pitch but it would be a more effective game plan overall. 

Adding to this, I actually prefer Lamela on the left because from what I remember he looked decent there and didn't dribble into the centre and lose the ball constantly. He could be a good left winger despite the fact he isn't very fast. I think Chaldli should be given a chance on the right too as he's got a good cross and makes intelligent runs out wide which can be just as effective as shear pace. 

We need to see the wingers putting in more crosses and forcing the other sides defence wide, it's painful to see us attacking down the middle all the time and then giving the ball away after creating nothing. I don't get why Poch is so determined to play his way when he doesn't have the players for it at the moment. The best managers play with what they have until they get the right players, just like Mourinho last season before he had Costa &amp; Fabrgas. Poch doesn't have all the right players yet and so should change the way we play to suit that and that doesn't mean we have to ditch the aggressive pressing mentality for good.

That's slightly backwards, actually. The vast majority of prescriptions are given for free, but the vast majority of people do not get free prescriptions.

You're right that old people get a lot of drugs, but charging the majority of people a small amount for medication does help reduce stresses on the NHS, amongst other things.

If you want a couple of paracetamol, you'll nip to the shop and spend 20p, whereas someone in Wales might choose to go to their doctor and get a prescription for free. It's really not ideal for GPs to spend their time writing out prescriptions for people with ""a bit of a headache,"" and one of the easiest ways around this is to charge people a nominal fee, say £8.05, for any drugs they do receive. Of course, we can't have people going without medication if they can't afford it, so some sectors of society should have it for free. Also, people who are chronically ill shouldn't be unfairly penalised for that, so we'll let them pay a reduced amount yearly, sort of a season ticket for hypochondriacs.

Charging for a prescription makes bugger all difference to the government in terms of income from it, but it does mean a lot of people who don't need to go to the doctor, don't go to the doctor.

&gt;The __Rhode Island Red__ is an American [breed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed) of [chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken) *(Gallus gallus domesticus)*. It is a utility [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird), raised for meat and [eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food\)), and also as a show bird. It is a popular choice for backyard flocks because of its egg laying abilities and hardiness. Non-industrial strains of the Rhode Island Red are listed as ""recovering"" by [The Livestock Conservancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Livestock_Conservancy). 

&gt;The Rhode Island Red is the [state bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_birds) of [Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island).

If you are interested at starting from the beginning and working your way through all the episodes, then brave heart uchiha2.  It's going to be a slog.  Personally I'd start with something along the lines of the fourth Doctor stories, Robot or Ark in Space.  The Pirate Planet is another good one, written by Douglas Adams, coincidentally.  These are all multi-episode stories, so plan accordingly.

As for new Who, I would recommend starting at any of The Doctors Run.  Watch them in order.  They build upon each other in some respects and you can watch his growth through the seasons.  These are all lovely one hour(ish) episodes that will suck you in, with the exceptions of a couple of stinkers.

As for Blink, I agree that it is a great one to start with sometimes.  I think it has all the elements to suck you into the world, even though the regulars aren't in it that much.  My other one episode go to is Vincent and The Doctor.  Have tissues near by.

And his amazing record thereafter - runners-up 2 years later, then semi-finalist (I still think we could have won the whole thing in Moscow, but for that Riise own goal in the last minute at Anfield v Chelsea) and quarters - really shows his mettle.

My teacher (who was from the UK and presumably knew something about universities) told me to go to London and nothing else. Unsurprisingly, I ended up at a shit uni because I didn't know any better than to follow advice from someone I thought would know better. 

[Here](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=politics) is the ranking table for Politics (closest I could find to International Relations). Look at where the unis you were given rank on that, look at their employment prospects. I would generally say if it's below 70% you should be aware of that and ready to question why. 

Also, look at the grade requirements yourself for each uni. The UWE will have vastly lower grade boundaries than Bristol or Edinburgh, say. It's not uncommon for unis like that to want 340 UCAS points, which is very high. 

As far as the unis you're currently interested in go, Edinburgh and Bristol have excellent reputations as prestigious insitutions. The cities are also very beautiful and good places to live. However, expect high entry standards and lots of competition for places. [Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2015/politics-international-relations/bsc-politics-international-relations/) lists Politics and International Relations as needing 320 UCAS points minimum - check that this is viable for you before applying. You don't want to waste your 5 slots on unis too difficult to get into *or* unis too easy to get into. Generally speaking, I'd say aim high for 2, pick 2 that you're 95% certain you'll get those grades, just, and pick 1 that you are absolutely certain you couldn't not get into. That way when you have your offers you can make an informed choice on which to pick rather than being limited by low entry standards or rejections because they don't think you'll make the grades. 

The other unis are pretty decent, but you absolutely need to research them individually. That league table I linked you puts Oxford Brookes at a 63% employment rate. That means that after 6 months for Politics, 37% of their graduates are neither in further study or a graduate-style job. Examine their courses, examine their employment rates, examine what other people say about the universities. Don't just go somewhere because your teacher said it's nice and the city looks okay; that might mean you throw away plenty of time and money into a degree you hate with poor prospects at the end. I thought that the city mattered more than anything else and I had to drop out and re apply. It was a massive pain in the ass and I would highly recommend not following me on that one!

I know researching universities yourself, particularly foreign ones, can seem daunting and I'm not saying you shouldn't ask for help. I am saying to do your research, though, because making a mistake would be costly. 

For emphasis: Do not just pick whatever city you think would be coolest. Seriously, there are nice cities and not-so nice cities, but you can always visit other cities you want to see. Take it from someone who was told to base their decision on the city and not worry about 'snobby useless rankings' - rankings are there for a reason.

It'll get up. It won't be fast or fun, but it'll do it. Some of the hills I've taken my girlfriends 17 year old 1.1 up in North Wales have very high gradients, yet it did them all with minimal fuss. 

It has to deal with a 25% incline just so she can visit me when we're visiting our parents back there, and in my head that's not even a proper hill!

Personally though, I think you are trying to fit far too much in. Especially if you are doing this in winter.

It'll take you 3 hours to drive from London to Brecon-ish at least. 

Then it'll take at the very least 3 hours to drive from Brecon-ish to Llanberis.
The drive, while beautiful, is very tiring. I don't know the Brecon Beacons very well but talking from experience driving through Snowdonia is especially tiring to drive through at points. I can imagine it's even less inviting during winter having already driven some 5 hours. 

Climbing Snowdon will take longer than you expect. I think Visit Snowdonia recommend at least 5 hours. The weather will probably be shit, so it'll take significantly longer. And if you aren't used to walking you'll finish the day more tired then you'd imagine, even in summer. From my experience of living in North Wales, winter in Snowdonia consists of stupidly strong winds, driving rains and snow cover isn't unusual.  Mountain Safe are already recommending crampons and an ice axe, with snow cover up to the knee in some places at the minute. 



[I don't want to bang on about it but(spoiler so I don't bore you!)](/s ""do not underestimate what you need to climb even relatively small and comparatively safe mountains, especially in winter. When I lived up that way it was an almost monthly occurrence to hear of a major rescue of experienced climbers in Snowdonia by the RAF and Mountain Rescue, and it wasn't uncommon to hear of people losing their lives either. I don't for a minute think you'd be one of the idiots that goes up their in trainers while it's covered in in snow, but even well equipped and experienced climbers are caught out."")

I won't go into the rest of the trip! It sounds wonderful and I'm sure it's doable but it won't be comfy and dare I say you'll be rushing about so it won't be fun?

He is an entertainer and a campaigner.

I don't buy this at all.

&gt; but there was a time when I wanted Hodgson out, and I don't appreciate you telling me I'm not really a Liverpool fan because of it!

I'm not. Thats a misunderstanding of what I said. FIrst of all: the specific, Hodgson:

The era of Hicks and Gillette were an anomoly. The very antithesis of what LFC were and (hopefully) are about. They effectively (long story, I'm sure you know this as well as I) stole money out of the club, and undermined the manager. And then sacked him and put in a feeble foot-in-mouth yes-man.

Ridding them and their yes man was akin to washing the stables out. Refreshing.

If anything, it showed how quickly everything can become toxic when we DO abandon the Liverpool way. And that applies to the owners as well.

And now to the general.

Thinking a manager is just not up to the task is not treason. Its an opinion. May be right, may be wrong (its a shame we have to spell it out like this, this should be obvious).

Whats wrong is how we act upon it. Screaming publically for his head, midway through a season, at every bad result - thats not the way.

When Souness was leading the team into the bottom half of the table, we still supported the team and manager through thick and thin (the Sun interview and the raw emotions it stirred is what really did for Souey and his relations with the support).

And ok, this is just a reddit, and its not going to affect anything in the real world. But it does get tedious seeing the same old nonsense. I know a few match-going Reds who DO spout crap online, but go to the game and cheer the team AND manager on regardless. Sometimes the raison d'etre of these supporter online forums IS to let off steam with little blowback.

Liverpool - very little  
West Brom - virtually none  
Newcastle - not a lot  
Villa - not a lot again  
Hull - very little, especially before the red  
Everton - we played fairly well but we didn't have loads of chances

QPR   
Sunderland  
Man city

Neither Henderson nor Gerrard plays back and so they leave Lucas hanging out to dry, while Allen isn't good enough to start over Hendo or Steve. If Johnson and Hendo/Stevie push up to attack, that leaves a giant hole between midfield and Skrtel with Lucas covering just one side. If Lucas is back there himself he can cover the width of the field and we get more balance going forward as well. I also don't think we have the quality to play 3 attacking midfielders right now

Don't forget that there are a lot of costs associated with owning rather than renting a property. The classic example is that at some point you're going to have to replace the boiler.

More importantly, it'll cost you a few k to buy and you really need to have some money for initial purchases *and* a decent emergency fund for the ""boiler scenario"" or similar. Plus you'll need at least 10% as a deposit, so you've got a few months before being in a reasonable position to buy.

Unless you're somewhere ridiculous, don't look at it as an investment, look for a home. 

Generally the plan looks decent. A fair salary, the mortgage doesn't sound impossible, and you're currently saving.

Crap transfers: I know a number of them have been a disappointment but Rodgers is not solely responsible for transfers, its actually starting to look like he has much less of a say than we were initially led to believe

lack of planning: I have no idea where you are getting this from you will have to give me some sort of example

inability to show even a glimmer of tactical nous: absolute nonsense, Rodgers has changed formation and tactics all over the show and is regarded as one of the most modern and flexible coaches by his former players and staff (see Garry Monk for quotes). 
The worst part of this is that its perpetuated by Sam Allardyce, a guy who puts his team out to play by numbers (i.e. only shoot when within x yards of goal).

binning of players to the point they want to leave: Who? Sahin? Rodgers might have played him out of position and he wasn't happy about it, hardly the first manager to do that. Agger? The guy was constantly injured and was allowed to leave to join a club of his choosing.
I am going to flip this one back at you, Rodgers didn't want Henderson, Hendo has changed his mind and is now one of the first names in the starting lineup. It's not a one off either look at Lucas this season, Rodgers has shown he is prepared to give players a chance contrary to this strange belief that he forces players out.

Ridiculous foot-in-mouth statements: No argument here, he speaks like someone who spent a lot of time around Jose Mourinho in press conferences. Jose sounds like a prat too 98% of the time. But because of the results on pitch it is just accepted as part of his ""charm"".

In my opinion Rodgers is the right guy for the job this season, the only way that changes is if we end up in a relegation battle.

At the end of the season you can evaluate all these things and see if they were just bumps in the road or symptoms of a much bigger problem.
