&gt;

&gt;The **Karaiskakis Stadium disaster** was an incident that occurred on 8 February 1981,  in the [Karaiskakis Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium) in Neo [Faliro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faliro), [Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), [Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece), after the conclusion of a football match between [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) and [AEK Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC). It is the biggest football [tragedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_(event\)) in Greece's history,  and among the worst in sports history.

&gt;A total number of 21 people, 20 supporters of [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos) and 1 supporter of [AEK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_F.C.), lost their lives while rushing out of the stadium to celebrate the victory of [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) against [AEK Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC) (6–0). The accident occurred in the historic [Gate 7](/w/index.php?title=Gate_7_(Olympiacos\)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) (Θύρα 7).  The stadium has since been rebuilt as a modern soccer football field (not a stadium).

&gt;There are still debates regarding the causes that led to the disaster. The main cause for the accident, according to the official police report, seems to have been a partially closed door. While exiting, some fans lost their balance and fell on the last steps. Dozens fell onto each other and were stepped over by a horde of unsuspecting fans who kept coming, making it for most of them extremely difficult to stand up or even defend themselves somehow. 19 supporters lost their lives within the stadium, while another two died of their wounds in hospital. At least 55 more were injured, many of them with major injuries. Most of the dead and wounded were teenagers and young adults.

&gt;what is remarkable about his theory is that it harnessed the rapaciousness of man and put it towards achieving something

Same again. 18th century you said?  Feudalism was around for longer than that, and proved eventually to be a bad system. I'm sure that people can come up with a better solution to living than this one. You mentioned China and India previously, the vast majority of their populations live in atrocious conditions, capitalism has done nothing to help them. 

&gt;I do indeed have a vested interest in maintaining a system that has proved time and again to raise people out of poverty and raise living standards.

I'm not arguing that communism is better for humanity, the theory is nice, the practise unfortunately not. I'm all for raising living conditions for everyone, but with capitalism we're still stuck with winners and losers. [As for the USSR, again, they practised state capitalism for the majority of their existence, I doubt that they were able to completely isolate themselves from outside influence. I can't believe the USA would leave them entirely alone. But I digress, I'm not arguing in favour of communism.]

&gt;Supply and demand is arguably the fundamental driver of markets

I know, that was my comment, everyone knows, there's no need to bring it up again! :)

&gt;A society with less medicine is a more moral one?

I give you the pharmaceutical companies that are suing various African nations to prevent them using generic AIDs medications. The desire to learn is a fundamental driver for humanity, just because people wouldn't be getting paid for something wouldn't stop them from learning. AS I argued earlier, maybe we'd have more people studying advancements if they didn't have to make a paycheck.

&gt;And perhaps I am a man of incredible mental fortitude, but I have never been forced to consume anything by advertising.

I don't want to sound offensive here, but you are deluded if you believe that, that person doesn't exist. 

The question is, we have a means of supply and demand, feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, educating the ignorant.

Unfortunately it looks like they're all sold out for the remainder of the season but they sometimes release a few tickets for sale in the week (usually Wednesday) leading up to the games which are only sold to members. 

In addition to guarantee tickets there's usually 2 sales during the season where members get access to (light + full) the tickets however for main games you need to have accumulated away visits or attended a certain number of home games. Therefore season ticket holders are usually given the opportunity to buy the tickets first. So if you only want to go twice a year then get the light membership and book them in advance during the members sale or you can try and get the general sale ones (much harder to get).

true,Edzhou2008,null,null,"Tim Sherwood is reverting back to Avbs old tactics -4/3/3 which I feel we are not suited for. As you have seen in the last two games we have played (vs. Dnipro and Norwich) Tim has slowly changing his adventurous and free-scoring 4/4/2 into a very bland and weak 4/3/3. 

Tottenham doesn't have the specific players to play in 433. We just don't have any brilliant midfielders that allow us to create chances from the possession that we usually  dominate.  Someone that is able to slice through a well organised defence with a perfectly weighted pass: like for example Luka Modric. Eriksen and holtby will become very creative players with experience and more matches but at the moment Tim is preventing such progress. 

We normally dominate possession against the smaller teams but we lack the great midfielders needed to dominate possession against the better teams like arsenal. Frankly this is my opinion, but capoue, sigs, bentaleb and paulinho ( to name a few) aren't up to scratch. 
Capoue: good position ally but poor in distribution and his awful surging runs.
Sigs: very good for a MID TABLE CLUB that played him regularly but lacks an eye for a pass in order to flourish at this club.
Bentaleb: Timmy's lovechild looked to be quite a player in his first few matches but now he is turning out to be the new jeans with all his sideways passes. However, with loan experience, could soon begin to dictate the tempo like carrick.
Paulinho: I have nothing against his skill or work rate but I feel that he is played in such a role that limits his full ability. I just don't think that he is a box to box midfielder yet don't really know where he will excel.

Our defence is tragic. Dawson is constantly befuddled by strikers and wingers when playing in a high line. Kaboul is too prone to injuries to be played regularly but is our best defender when fully fit. Chiriches is not played enough. Vertonghen should be paired with chi in a high line. 

Onto our full backs; walker is a very good attacking full back but is prone to mistakes defensively. Rose is not yet at the standard that is required to play in a top 4 club but will develop into a evra-esque player. Naughton is a good backup - but only a back up. Fryers and Fredericks have shown good potential but need some experience on loan first. We NEED full backs desperately; as shown when vertonghen had to play left back when rose was injured. My recommendations would be to get evra in order to help rose progress fast.

Goalkeeper department is good but I dread to find out what happens when lloris leaves for PSG. 

Our wingers have potential and can be deadly on their day but are constantly faced with consistency issues. The decision to buy inverted wingers ( chadli, lamela) is completely daft when someone like babas would have stretched the pitch and given more opportunities for soldado to score. 

Finally, onto the strikers; soldado is going through a dry patch that is in now way a fault of his own. He is often played with inverted wingers that prefer to shot rather than supply balls into the penalty box, which he will tuck away. As you have seen in the last few matches, crosses make soldado deadlier. Now it is just a matter of restoring his confidence. 
God knows how desperate we are, if we are relying on Ade to help us reach top 4. The highly INCONSISTENT striker is playing like in his early days at aresnal but I don't want to know what happens when he loses motivation. 

Rants over, got everything off my chest and hope spurs will achieve top 4 ( although unlikely).

It strikes me that as opposed to the other wingers listed who are expected to make plays now and then that has obviously never been what has been asked of Lennon.  

His role seems to be (and really always has been) to disrupt an opposing team's defense, to be a menace and thorn in the side of the defenders. If they ignore him despite is lack of technical skills he can hit a cross or make a quick pass and on a VERY RARE occasion notch a goal.  Basically Lennon is out there so the other team has to pay attention to the right flank.

In the past it has been fine to have this on the pitch because we were obviously stronger on the left and seemingly more stable and productive in the center.

This season....well we have never had any stability anywhere in the lineup and haven't had any major contribution from the left side (except when Eriksen was lined up on that side and he drifted inside most of the time) and struggled up the middle (again, it seemed unless we had Eriksen in the middle with the exception of NUFC match and Small Paul at Stoke)....we have been wildly unbalanced all season at times both positive and negative.

Past couple seasons we seemed to look more fluid with Lennon in the lineup but with the struggle to achieve any sort of consistency this season we really need a more rounded player on the pitch as the disruptive quality to Lennon is wasted when we are unbalanced.

Free kicks, shooting, and crossing are not the only technical skills.  Seb Larrsson isn't the perfect footballer.. he's hardly more than a youtube video.  Under AVB, Lennon  was really flourishing... and that wasn't that long ago.  I'll say it again, I think Townsend and Lamela are the future (I love Lamela), but Lennon definitely has a role while Townsy is still learning and Lamela is getting patched up.  Your critique of Lennon seems biased, and largely unfounded.  His skill set is not based on crossing/shooting at all, it is based on pace, work rate, spacial awareness (especially during and after AVB).

true,Cheimon,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt; Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by a government, media outlet or other controlling body.

It is *not* about the truth.  It is about getting rid of whatever a controlling body wants to be suppressed.  It is an exceptionally broad term, and not one that should be narrowed down unnecessarily for fear of changing the meaning of it and the power the word has.  

In any case, I'm not certain you realise how close the phrase ""preventing non-truth is just about keeping to the truth in the forefront"" is to a classic dictatorial justification of censorship. 

Of course, I'm assuming you think censorship is a Bad Thing, and that's why you're trying to make sure it only fits when it describes Bad Things.  Perhaps it has its place, and you'd rather not suggest that?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  But dribbling is a technical skill, and he is very good at it

Some types of dribbling involves technical ability. Lennons type involves kiccking the ball forward and running after it. And his dribbling isnt particularly good regardless - he averages 1.2 dribbles per game - and those stats are juiced up by the fact that he has only mde one sub appearence. There are 46 players in the PL who average more dribbles per game than him (Via whoscored)

&gt; his passing has been fairly good lately.

His passing was good vs Norwich - that is one game, as a whole it has been awful. Watch the Swansea game for example - the amount of simple passes he missed were incredible, i couldnt count the amount of times that Eriksen was in space and lennon missed the pass to him. His pass success rate vs Everton was the lowest on the field IIRC - It was something pathetic like 50% at half-time....

&gt; Under AVB, Lennon was really flourishing...

He played well last season. THis season? Not so much... While I think it is unfair to talk about goals and assists under AVB given our finishing under him and the system etc... He still only got 0 goals and 0 assists.

&gt; Your critique of Lennon seems biased, and largely unfounded

Name one thing as I said which was unfounded - as I named a lot above including the relevant stats.

&gt;  His skill set is not based on crossing/shooting at all, it is based on pace, work rate, spacial awareness 

Ok so I really hate having to deal with this argument but ill go ahead.... Sure he has good pace and work rate but in the end of the day what exactly comes of it?? Ok defensively he is productive but in the end of the day going forward he produces little. He was never productive in terms of goals and assists but at least he used to pull players out of position and bring us up the field - much like Andros does now (And Andros certainly has the ability to be very productive in term of goals and assists also - and has being produvtive for England where he has been more of a team player and less selfish) however he doesnt do any of that now. He doesnt beat his man very much, in fact he rarely beats his man looking at the dribbling stats.

&gt; He can definitely go missing from games, but that isn't always down to just him...

It kind of is though. Hes often poor when he is closely marked and vs Hull and Everton for example he seemed to be actively shying away from the ball.

&gt; It seems like you're just falling victim to confirmation bias 

I can guarentee that that is certainly not something that I have fallen victim to.

The thing with olympiakos in Greece is that they represent what united represents (or used to represent) in England. 

The richest team in the country,  winners of many consecutive championships, they have established a very strong relationship with the Greek football association and the referees, they buy literally every young greek talent and they have destroyed competition in the league. 

It's true that both Karaiskakis stadium and Hillsborough disasters have things in common and it is nice to see support for the fight for the 96.

You can't just say 'Themuns got an inquiry, we want one'. You need some subject that would be usefully inquired into. What question, specifically, do you want asked about the killings of civilians by the IRA? Unlike Bloody Sunday, ""Were the people killed unlawfully?"" is trivially answered with a resounding 'yes' in almost every case. 

And ""Did specific person Y kill person X?"" is generally better suited for a police investigation, since it's their job to prosecute the people involved. (The Troubles did have a much lower rate of solving homicides than the mainland UK - 50% compard to about 90% - this is partly because of the difficulty of policing communities where sections of the population - and in some cases the police - may sympathise with the killers, and partly because the number of killings was so high that investigations were relatively brief. Northern Ireland didn't have an Anti Terrorist Squad along the Metropolitan Police lines because there were so many terrorist incidents that singling out one or two for in-depth specialist investigation would be wasteful and silly.)

It's general questions of a contentious nature that seem to be the proper subjects of inquiries, such as 'Were the people killed at Bloody Sunday killed unlawfully?"" or ""Were British forces somehow responsible for the killing of Pat Finucane?"". 

On the other hand, there have been inquiries into IRA killings in cases where the governments consider there might be some questions worth answering. Last year saw the conclusion of the Smithwick Tribunal into the extent of Garda collusion with the killings of RUC officers Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan, and Martin McGuinness was called up in front of the Bloody Sunday tribunal you refer to, because of suggestions he may have been carrying weapons on that day.

English law basically didn;t codify privacy at all, as can be seen in stories such as [this]( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/17/lords.prisonsandprobation).

It was the Sarah Cox case in 2003 which started to change that, but even then Cox v The People was settled out of court, so there still wasn't any case law.

Maybe some of it is rational. Maybe some of its anger. Maybe some of it's jealously. Maybe some of it is in absolutely hope that we actually do fuck up so they can say ""I told you so."" Maybe some of it is in hope of absolute relief when it does happen. What I do know is that all we can do is take it one match at a time and grind out these fucking three points when we can. At the end of the day, I could give a rat's ass if we win 11-10 as long as we win. Yes, it's very Keegan-esque letting in 10 goals and scoring one more wouldn't be that great to stomach, but in terms of this season we've come way too fucking far to be self critical in the manner we get those points. The fact is that we are where we are because we've earned. Full stop. People will make excuses on how Liverpool is in this position but go fuck yourself. We're here. 

Before there was no way we could get Europa League. Then there was no way we'd get 4th. Now there's no way we can actually win. Now it may or may not happen, but the fact is the position we're in right now makes a lot of fucking people way too uncomfortable. Just the way we like it everyone, just the way we like it.

&gt;

&gt;The **Karaiskakis Stadium disaster** was an incident that occurred on 8 February 1981,  in the [Karaiskakis Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium) in Neo [Faliro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faliro), [Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), [Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece), after the conclusion of a football match between [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) and [AEK Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC). It is the biggest football [tragedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_(event\)) in Greece's history,  and among the worst in sports history.

&gt;A total number of 21 people, 20 supporters of [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos) and 1 supporter of [AEK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_F.C.), lost their lives while rushing out of the stadium to celebrate the victory of [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) against [AEK Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC) (6–0). The accident occurred in the historic [Gate 7](/w/index.php?title=Gate_7_(Olympiacos\)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) (Θύρα 7).  The stadium has since been rebuilt as a modern soccer football field (not a stadium).

&gt;There are still debates regarding the causes that led to the disaster. The main cause for the accident, according to the official police report, seems to have been a partially closed door. While exiting, some fans lost their balance and fell on the last steps. Dozens fell onto each other and were stepped over by a horde of unsuspecting fans who kept coming, making it for most of them extremely difficult to stand up or even defend themselves somehow. 19 supporters lost their lives within the stadium, while another two died of their wounds in hospital. At least 55 more were injured, many of them with major injuries. Most of the dead and wounded were teenagers and young adults.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; Poverty is the result of poor or non-existant planning. Were you born into poverty? I agree that both homelessness and central heating etc. is [possibly] a result of capitalism. My question is, now we are in the 21st century, can't we do better than this?

Poverty is a lack of wealth. You can certainly attempt to spread existing wealth more evenly, or you can attempt to encourage more wealth to be created. Either way there will be poor people, but the latter system has a better track record.

&gt; You mentioned China and India previously, the vast majority of their populations live in atrocious conditions, **capitalism has done nothing to help them.**

That just simply isn't true.

&gt; I give you the pharmaceutical companies that are suing various African nations to prevent them using generic AIDs medications. The desire to learn is a fundamental driver for humanity, just because people wouldn't be getting paid for something wouldn't stop them from learning. AS I argued earlier, maybe we'd have more people studying advancements if they didn't have to make a paycheck.

You would have people studying medicine in either system but it seems pretty obvious that the incentive is greater when there is money on the table. Of course at any given time you see people with medicine not willing to lower their prices or give away their product. The question is whether that injustice is outweighed by the cost of medicine declining over time as production techniques improve, and never and better medicines being created.

&gt; I don't want to sound offensive here, but you are deluded if you believe that, that person doesn't exist.

I don't much care if you want to offend me or not. Nobody has ever been forced into buying a product because of advertisers. Encouraged, yes. Coerced? No.

&gt; The question is, we have a means of supply and demand, feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, educating the ignorant. Just because it's the one we use right now, does that mean it has to be the one we use forever more, or can we come up with a better idea? Can YOU come up with a better idea?

No, I can't come up with a better idea, and a great deal of damage has been done by people who thought their ideas were superior. Free market capitalism isn't perfect, but it has fought off all the alternatives for the time being, with relatively minor concessions towards welfare. Any economic system we have will fail some people. And indeed freedom must include the freedom to make bad decisions.

Yeah, but there's plenty of evidence that they do.  Classical music used to have a massive gender gap, partly down to overt sexism (some orchestras were male-only until relatively recently) but there was also research showing that women were consistently far more likely to be successful in blind auditions than in normal ones, so there was clearly some subconscious bias going on.  Nowadays blind auditions are apparently the norm, as it turns out to be the only way to ensure decisions are made based purely on how good the musician's playing sounds as opposed to their gender, appearance, personality, etc.

There's loads of research looking at gender bias in evaluations of job performance, much of which finds significant bias once all other factors are controlled for.  Basically, if men are sterotyped as being good at something, then people will rate men as being better at it, even if they are in fact just as good as women (and vice versa).

We all have biases and it's hard enough to switch them off when you are judging something abstract like musical skills, let alone more wooly things that are closely tied to your personality, like organisation, people skills, and initiative (or indeed humour).",0,1393367702,null,0,false,0,cfonwsq,t3_1yvqxc,t1_cfonwsq,t1_cfof8cd,null,1432558848,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Soldado would be my next choice to keep, falling only slightly behind Lamela, because of his age. I love his professionalism, but he's probably already peaked statistically.

I find myself thinking that sometimes, but then I start thinking about all the male comedians I don't like who keep being invited on panel shows.  Somehow with men, my reaction is always ""why do other people find him funny"", not ""they must have had some ulterior motive to invite him on"".

I think there's also an issue that a lot of comedy programmes seem to be aimed specifically at men (at least judging by the gender ratio of their audiences).  If you had more female comedians on the panels, then maybe men would find it harder to relate to them and would be less likely to watch, but you might find that more women would watch.

Just think Azplicueta could do with a rest, he hasn't missed a game in months and Cole is an exceptionally able deputy. Ramires has a knock so perhaps Mikel could play instead, but I don't like the negativity he brings to the play. Oscar clearly needs a rest, he's been poor in the last few games and Schurrle probably deserves a run in the team, whilst I went for Torres to keep Eto'o fresh for the league run-in.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hold your horses buddy. Bamford has been doing well but when Lukaku hasn't been injured he has been doing pretty amazing for whatever club he played at in the PL. Now that he is injured and cant score goals to get people to shutup he seems to be an easy target.

You can't compare a 19 year old getting a hattrick against Manchester United and one who has yet to score a hatrick in league 1. And their goal records for their last recent seasons are not too different. 

In 32	apps for MK Dons, Bamford scored 17 goals. In 35 apps for West Brom last season, Lukaku scored 17 goals. The difference? One is in League 1 the other in the Barclays Premier League.

People on this subreddit like to build up youth players *way* to much. I think Bamford is doing well and is showing promise, but thats about it right now. You cant be making ridiculous predictions about him or compare him with other players like this when he has only had 8 appearances for Derby so far.

Edit: Also, even though Lukaku was in a little slump before his injury, he still has 9 goals in 20 appearances for Everton.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; We have more than enough wealth to feed the world. I'm sure I don't need to dig up the studies that show virtually all the wealth of the world is concentrated into very small areas, usually families. There doesn't have to be any poor. If the wealth was freed up, it would then just be a matter of logistics. Our ability to provide for ourselves as a species is getting better, soon we will have virtually unlimited resources. What happens then, does it get spread out or hoarded by those families again?

When you say ""freed up"" what you actually mean is ""taken from the people who made it and given to the people who didn't"". Theft, in common parlance. 

It's difficult to know where to begin with an idea this bad. Economies that attack profiteering inevitably reduce incentive for investment, and ultimately limit wealth creation. Even if we divided the wealth up, not all societies are equally capable of retaining wealth. The West is lucky enough to have strong institutions and better social mores for retaining wealth, but this is not true of all countries and is not a problem that is solved by throwing money at it. In economics nothing is unlimited, and there is no sign we are headed towards a lack of scarcity. ""Virtually unlimited"" is a roundabout way of saying ""limited"".

&gt; If someone is continually starving, with no shelter, no access to medical support, then what has the economic system done to help them? nothing.

This is true of very few people, and without capitalism even fewer would have access to these things.

&gt; Look at all the research students who are fighting for grants to study whatever they want. They can't get them so it's McDonalds and a 60 hour working week. Seems pretty obvious that if you have more research, then you have more results.

There are an unlimited number of things to be researched and only a limited number of people to research them. A certain proportion of chosen research projects will be useful through design or accident, but that proportion is guaranteed to be lower than when research is incentivised through market forces.

&gt; The question is whether that injustice is outweighed by the cost of medicine declining over time as production techniques improve, and never and better medicines being created.

I meant: The question is whether that injustice is outweighed by the cost of medicine declining over time as production techniques improve, which in turn leads to better medicines being created.

&gt; When advertisers started targeting children, then that argument stopped holding water.

We obviously have different definitions of ""forced"". 

&gt; I suspect that is exactly what it has done, fought them off. Not been a better system, but a much more aggressive corrosive one. Especially nowadays when the free market is anything but free.

Lack of freedom in the market in the West is largely a result of people believing central planning can do the job better. 

&gt; To me, the argument is ""the world is constantly changing, new and better ways of doing things crop up all the time. With all the extra resources we have nowadays, can we make more of them?"" The current system that encourages hoarding or resources is not one fit for the future.

Free market capitalism does not reward hoarders in the long term.",0,1393373604,null,0,false,0,cfoqqg2,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cfoqqg2,t1_cfoo9hq,null,1432560178,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm pretty sure that everyone with more than a fraction of a single brain cell had already worked out it was going to be neatly resolved with a paradox that has no lasting consequences at all.

Season 5: The pandorica was a bill&amp;ted paradox  
Season 6: Hey, a paradox and a lie resolved everything  
Season 7: What, Clara was a paradox - only becoming a companion because of events that happened because she was a companion? You don't say!  
Day of the Doctor: Rewriting time? Oh, we're going way beyond the usual paradoxes we create  
Time of the Doctor: Oh, I wonder how this will be resolved? Surely with something creative and unexpected. It'll be really hard to predict, right?  

Seriously, did you not see the whole ""look, everything is a paradox"" solution coming?

(And that's ignoring RTD's run with the ""bad wolf"" and ""saxon"" related paradoxes, not to mention a few of the easter/christmas specials. But Moffat is in charge. At one point, I was happy that RTD's crap was at an end.)

&gt; However, they save the day and change the future. [...] That entire story arc is over.

And, as a result, he doesn't meet the girl in the Dalek Asylum or the Victorian nanny, so he has no reason to go looking for his ""impossible girl"" who is never with him at Trenzalore, and doesn't go have an exciting adventure with three of his regenerations. Whoops.

Considering that all of time exploded because of River killing and not killing the Doctor, the whole ""oh, the timelords are around, they made everything ok"" just feels incredibly lazy. I have to say I could cope with a few less ""it was all a paradox, moving on now"" endings.

&gt; I wouldn't get my hopes up for any more answers regarding the Silence 

Well, the church is so large that one break-away bunch of heretics managed to populate half the universe, not to mention create human civilization because that was easier than filling in the paperwork to requisition a space suit from storage, while the main body of the church just hung out around one planet and did very little to help anyone.

I'm hoping we don't get any more efforts to ""explain"" this bullshit, and somehow Moffat gets a fucking grip, and tones down the ""all time and space is at risk"" and ""it's a paradox"" crap. We had enough of that from RTD, I expected better from Moffat.

true,Karma9999,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt;When you say ""freed up"" what you actually mean is ""taken from the people who made it

Actually I meant 2 things, but to address your concern about taking from people who make it, the vast majority of .01%ers inherit their money, so the only thing they have done to earn it is to be born into the right family. The other part of what I meant was that we are becoming more efficient at producing wealth by your definition, the question is who should benefit from it? Oh yes, ""Virtually unlimited""  is my way of saying effectively unlimited, just trying to avoid scaring you with the concept. Read up on current and projected concepts for asteroid mining and solar energy farming. 

&gt; A certain proportion of chosen research projects will be useful through design or accident, but that proportion is guaranteed to be lower than when research is incentivised through market forces.

Did you mis-speak here? I assume you intended to say the proportion will be higher if incentivised, or that they would be useless. As a general rule of thumb, there is no such thing as useless research, just research we haven't yet found a use for. This counts double and more for research with any relevance into space travel etc. Ignoring any possible concerns over tinfoil-hattery, the sheer increase in work being done would outweigh any concerns about lack of direct specificity. 

&gt;..which in turn leads to better medicines being created.

The major problem with medicines currently is the patent roll-over, where pharmaceutical companies change the formulation of a viable medicine that is coming out of patent, in order to claim a new patent or prevention of duplication. This 'patently' [sorry for the pun] goes against the concept of the free market, yet is allowed by virtually all developed countries. This problem is duplicated in most major industries in one manner or another. I think I mentioned earlier that we don't actually have a free market economy anyway. 

&gt;We obviously have different definitions of ""forced"".

Probably. I go with kids screaming at parents day in day out for the latest in some form of brand-name goods to be coercion.

&gt;Lack of freedom in the market in the West is largely a result of people believing central planning can do the job better.

Again, probably true. Though it's interesting to note that one of the major bones of contention in this scenario, health care, is made vastly more affordable when collective bargaining is carried out by governments on behalf of customers. The NHS in the UK, France and Canada are obvious examples. It's only now that the UK government is attempting to screw with the system to enforce privatisation that we start having more and more cracks in the care for patients. 

&gt;Free market capitalism does not reward hoarders in the long term.

It might not, I wouldn't know. We haven't had a free market in a long time, if ever. What I do know is that under the current legal system hoarders flourish, as do bankers, politicians and other associated law-makers. One hand washes the other, the system is inherently corrupt. Who can fix it? No one in a position to fix these problems  have any interest at all in solving them. I'll spare you my comments on political class. 

I'm sorry but it's getting late so I'm going to call it for the evening. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the future and how things could work out under changing circumstances [eg as above], if you would like to carry this on?

Yeah, but souffle girl and victorian nanny girl were apparently real people, too. Why couldn't Susan be his granddaughter, regenerate, get her parents to move to Earth, suffer explosive amnesia, and have them merely change the location for the story of their meeting? Maybe the Doctor wasn't paying attention to how his kid hooked up with another time lord and had a baby, so didn't recognize the story.

And time can be rewritten, so maybe she didn't used to be Susan but now she is, and that's how she was born to save the Doctor.

&gt; and frankly that's an awful theory

True, but between ""bad wolf"" and ""doctordonna"" and ""impossible girl, mk 1"" and ""impossible girl, mk 2"" (yeah, like Clara is the first ""impossible girl"" in the series since 2005 - Moffat really loves that phrase) I frankly consider ""Clara is actually a time lord with an amazingly good disguise and explosive amnesia"" to be one of the less offensive theories, even including ones that made it into the actual show.

But yes, Olympiakos was the team against whom Gerrard scored probably his most famous goal ever to take us through to the knock-out stage of the CL in 04/05. 

Going into the final games of the group there were 3 teams still in the frame; Olympiakos 10 points, Monaco 9, Liverpool 7. Monaco were the previous years losing finalists and were playing Deportivo, who were already out by this stage, so we could expect them to get 3 points and go through (they followed the script and won 5-0). Olympiakos beat us 1-0 on their patch earlier in the group, so winning would have the two teams equal on both points and the first tie breaker - head to head. So before the game even kicked off we had to look at the next tie breakers; goal difference between the two teams (**not** overall group goal difference) and then away goals, essentially turning the game into a knock out game.

26 minutes in Rivaldo scores. 2-0 down on aggregate and they have an away goal. We need to score 3 goals unanswered.

Pongolle comes on at half time and scores almost straight away, but after a good start to the half a couple of missed chances and a ruled out goal take the wind out of our sails. Until Neil Mellor pops onto the pitch with ~10 minutes left. Two minutes later he stabs the ball in from a couple of yards out. A couple of super subs have dragged us back into it.

Personnel was wrong at Anfield this season too, Sakho and Toure as full backs (necessarily so, due to injuries) prevented overlapping runs and stagnated our attack.

So while we have lost our last two, I don't think they're quite a bogey team for us, and with Johnson back and Flanagan playing well we shouldn't have the same issues we had at Anfield this season.  We will, however, need to be wary of their pressing, I wonder if a midfield three (Gerrard, Cout, Hendo) with Sturridge, Suarez, and Sterling given license to roam up top would be appropriate...Coutinho would have to put in a defensive workload though, but he's shown more ability to do so of late.

Should be a good game in any case, I think it will really depend on that midfield battle - if we can get our passing on song, and settle down a bit, we should be good.",0,1393378361,null,0,false,0,cfoswiw,t3_1ywhsf,t1_cfoswiw,t1_cfodlst,null,1432561252,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"This is an example of a negative feedback loop.  There are probably a large number of women out there who could potentially be outstanding comedians, however they see how the industry is dominated by males (and how the few female comedians who have some prestige are largely not favoured by elements of the public) and think that they don't have a chance. So they don't go into comedy. Meaning the industry remains male-dominated.  And since no female who could be a good comedian goes into comedy, the public continues the bizarre perception that having female genitalia somehow makes a person less capable of being a comedian, reinforcing the male-dominance.

I've always had mixed feelings about positive discrimination for exactly the reasons Dara points out (and positive discrimination is still discrimination).  However I do think it serves a good purpose - the negative feedback loop was set up when we actively discriminated against minorities.  Although we live in brighter days now, the feedback loop is self-reinforcing and therefore it requires brute forcing to break the loop.  

In an ideal world, yes we hire women based solely on their merit and nothing else but that's not possible as long as women feel they don't have enough merit to compete with men.  The purpose of minority quotas is to say ""Look don't think that your sexuality/gender/race is a handicap preventing you from pursuing this career path, we need you"".

At first, of course people WILL just see it as fulfilling token positions.  However as more minorities go into comedy, those who felt they were unlikely to be able to pursue a career in comedy because they are a minority will begin to feel more confident that they can just pursue the career they want.  Eventually the pool of good minority comedians will be so large that we won't NEED to use quotas to ensure an equal panel, it will just occur naturally on merit.

tl;dr Positive discrimination isn't THE golden solution to diversity in the workplace, it is just a means to jump start the process until the old discriminatory ways are purged from society.",0,1393378456,null,0,false,0,cfosy3k,t3_1yvqxc,t1_cfosy3k,t1_cfo8ikg,null,1432561273,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Women are strong.  The fact that they feel intimidated is bad, but it's infantilizing women to think that they're so weak that the odd sexist comment is enough to deter them.

It's absolutely true that sexism exists, but I don't believe in these endless claims that there's an oppressive patriarchy who are holding all women back, and which explains gender disparities from fields as diverse as stand-up comedy to engineering.

We're living in the age of the internet and youtube.  If there really is an untapped goldmine of female comedy, then there's nothing to stop women from making their own comedy videos free of *any* interference from sexism.  

A similar argument can be made for computer science - there's absolutely *nothing* to stop women from writing their own code.  You could, if you so chose start writing code tonight without any input or even contact from men.  You could release that code without anyone even knowing your gender.

All evidence I've seen about women in computing points to the fact that there are fewer women for the simple reason that fewer women *want* to go into that field - and that could well be because of innate differences in preferences between the genders. 

Yes, there's sexism, but I don't think it's anywhere near enough to account for the male-female gaps we see in subjects like engineering.  It also doesn't account for the fact that women are outperforming men in schools and in many other academic subjects excepting the 'nerdy' ones.

Edit:  [Here's a good article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-nature-nurture-nietzsche-blog/201402/the-sticking-point-why-men-still-outnumber-women-in-sc) just out on the psychology today website which goes over this debate in much more detail.  I strongly encourage you and others who are interested in this topic to read it.

&gt;**Jiggs dinner** is a traditional meal commonly prepared and eaten on Sundays in many regions around the province of [Newfoundland and Labrador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador), [Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada). [Corned beef and cabbage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corned_beef_and_cabbage) was the favorite meal of Jiggs, the central character in the popular, long-running comic strip, Bringing Up Father, by [George McManus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McManus) and [Zeke Zekley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeke_Zekley) after whom the dish is likely named. The name of the dish is also occasionally rendered as **Jigs dinner** or **Jigg's dinner**. In the rendering ""Jigg's dinner"", the apostrophe is incorrectly placed if in reference to the McManus character. The term ""Jiggs dinner"" is the most common of all renderings. This meal may also be called **boiled dinner** or **cooked dinner** by some Newfoundlanders.

true,shabouwcaw,lfc99,,"as far as I know, the reason it's taking so long is because the redevelopment is not just of Anfield, it's of the entire surrounding area. There will be hotels, commercial areas and hospitality stuff in the environs of the stadium, both to rejuvenate the area and also due to a rule in British urban planning that residential areas must have access to sunlight, which means that the stadium could never be made big enough, since it would overshadow people's back gardens etc. With a large enough area of commercial property around the stadium, it can be substantially taller and steeper than it currently is. 

However, the actual expansion of the stadium cannot go ahead until the surroundings have been rezoned and the council has their house in order to start their part of the redevelopment. I'm sure if it were left purely to LFC things would be moving much more quickly, but I'm sure local government have to avoid paying over the odds for property and must make sure it goes through proper planning and tendering processes.

There's a lot of red tape involved in massive urban development schemes like this, it is natural it would take a while.

as for the shared stadium in Stanley Park, I'm pretty sure that is now not happening and that the planned redevelopment of Anfield will be the plan, starting hopefully in 2015. As far as I'm aware the plan is to build a new Main Stand behind the current stand, leaving the Main Stand in operation throughout the 2015 season and then demolishing and completing the new larger stand over the summer break. This should increase the capacity of the stand by 9,000, approximately the capacity of the Anfield Road end, leaving the capacity the same while the Anfield Road end is closed for construction. They're gonna repeat that process of expanding capacity then closing a different stand for each of the 4 sides, finishing with the most recently renovated Centenary Stand. 

I don't have sources on all this, it's just off the top of my head from things I've read all over the place, but as far as I'm aware, that's the current state of play with regards to the stadium and they're in an advanced state of planning regarding the renovation.

Given played his final match on loan at Middlesbrough on Saturday, keeping his 10th clean sheet in 16 games for the Teessiders, but knows that won't lead to another chance under Paul Lambert at Villa Park.

The 37-year-old has been forced to return to Villa, where he knows his is not wanted, although he hopes that another ambitious Championship club come in for him this season. 

""It looks like I will be going back and I won't be playing much football. That's the situation I am in. Hopefully something will happen in the summer somewhere,"" said Given. ""It has been really frustrating not playing before I came here. That's obvious for everyone to see and the window doesn't open until the summer, so maybe there is a Championship club out there who might want me. 

""I might go back out again somewhere before the end of March. Aston Villa want me out of the door, so something might happen. ""It was a bit emotional at the end of the game because all the fans gave me a standing ovation. ""I would like to thank them genuinely. It's a wrench to leave, I would have liked to have stayed until the end of the season."" 

Given, who still has two years left on his Villa contract, earns £60,000 a week but has not played a first team game since January 2013.

Aston Villa teenager Jack Grealish has excelled on loan at Notts County to such an extent that senior boss Martin O’Neill admitted he considered promoting the tyro for the friendly against Serbia on the same day.

King reckons it’s only a matter of time before Grealish displays his considerable talent on a higher stage.

“For his sake, I hope to lose him soon,” admitted King. “He’s a very exciting player and reminds me a bit of Robbie Brady when he started with our U21s and was running the show.

“He made his debut for us in August at only 17. Now, after getting plenty of international and club games under his belt, he’s even stronger.

“I thought he’d struggle a little bit physically in League One for Notts County but it’s been quite the opposite as he’s more than holding his own.

“Without putting too much pressure on him to develop year on year, by the time he is 21, you could have a very good talent.”

King shares O’Neill’s sentiments from last week that Ireland’s emerging talents are finding it more difficult to make an impact in the Premier League. “From the last U21 group, we had great hopes for Conor Henderson, Adam Barton, Greg Cunningham and Conor Clifford because they’re excellent players,” he outlined before adding ominously, “but sometimes things don’t work out at their clubs and they have to start again lower down.” ",0,1393387680,null,0,false,0,cfox5gk,t3_1yyket,t1_cfox5gk,t3_1yyket,null,1432563255,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

The rapist simply thought that at that point they had a right to sex and forced it, ignoring pleas to stop, pain, and the other person completely freezing up. A lot of them were very defensive about it and had a lot of others reassuring them and telling them not to feel bad.

When going blank and freezing is a very common fear response, it's terrible for people to say that it's fine to ignore that because it's not a verbal no. You KNOW if your partner is not responding because they've gone elsewhere in their heads. You *surely* have to know.

Stating that this is ""the bottom line"" ignores just about every difference the new system has beyond the baseline amount to be repaid. 

The whole point of the new system's adjustments are to reduce the amount that people have to repay every year. Just about everybody's set to repay significantly less per year than under the old system- to an enormous extent, compared with the old £15,000 repayment threshold. 

That's the difference that matters. Graduates on lower salaries will barely have to pay back a thing. You only pay back what you can afford.

It goes beyond not ""directly"" shutting anyone out- it doesn't shut anyone out at all. The only reason someone would have to not take up a university education under the present system's an incomplete understanding of how the system works. It's an entirely reasonable setup. 

I'd prefer it if things were completely free, of course- but we could do far, far worse than this.

true,2FishInATank,null,null,"Most research suggests that the human brain only reaches something approaching a 'steady state' in the mid-20s (late 20s in some research). Naturally, life experience feeds into this in a progressive manner, but the rate of change flattens after that point. So the fact is that you have yet to reach this stage in your life. This isn't a pejorative observation, just one where it's impossible to convey just how much a human's thought processes will change in the transition from teenager to adult.

And yes, I know that in coming years I will have a view on life which is further expanded from where it is now.

However, you can't know what and how much you're going to learn in the next (say) 20 years, therefore you can't presume that you'll hold the same opinions on this subject. 

Nor can you presume to understand why people - many of whom are parents - object to the DM's use of 'all grown up' as shorthand for 'very young woman looking sexy'. 

Seriously, go and search [that phrase](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?sel=site&amp;searchPhrase=all+grown+up) on the DM site - there's the thick end of *1000 pages* of articles on there at 20 per page!

Granted, there will be some articles which are inconsequential, but the overwhelming number which operate on a 'nod and a wink' is ridiculous.

For the record, no - the article you linked to wasn't the sort to which I was referring, and I suspect you're well aware of that. You've created a strawman and have successfully knocked it down. 

But as you've brought up Elle Fanning, how about when [the Daily Mail basically stole a picture of her at 14 years old off Instagram](http://dmreporter.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/allgrownup/) and posted it to their ""sidebar of shame""?  
The tagline was ""Teenager Elle Fanning shows off her womanly curves"".  
Just a reminder - she was ***FOURTEEN.*** **YEARS. OLD.**

If you think that's acceptable, I can only suggest you seek therapy.

They've also run stories with less-than-savoury comments about numerous other underage girls such as Charlotte Church and Emily Watson when they were teenagers.

So here we have a publication that regularly violates the privacy of teenagers through paparazzi culture and directly contributes to the culture of child sexualisation. The fact that they've been heavily involved in pressurising the government to implement 'porn blocks' would be laughably hypocritical, if it weren't all so stomach-churningly grim.

STEM students go mad from overwork. Arts students seem to just lose drive altogether after a certain point- it feels like we're just trudging through a degree mill at times. Two seminars a week filled with other equally crushed, disinterested students and tutors so ground-down that they might as well be teaching from bullet points per module scarcely constitutes active engagement with students. Students are just left to twist in the wind- there's no proactive engagement if someone's clearly having difficulty with anything, and what care services exist tend to come with a three week waiting list before anything can be done (which, I'll admit, is vastly better than the horror show available outside, on the NHS proper).

The story was by Sam Fell, [Peter Lord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lord), [Dick Clement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Clement), and [Ian La Frenais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_La_Frenais), and the screenplay was written by Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, [Christopher Lloyd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lloyd_(screenwriter\)), Joe Keenan, and [William Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Davies_(screenwriter\)).

&gt;The film was released in US on 3 November 2006, and in UK on 1 December 2006, and was distributed by [Paramount Pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures), except for Switzerland, Spain, and the Netherlands, which were handled by [Universal Pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios).

I don't believe this was sentenced as an entirely unprovoked assault. Per the daily mail article, part of the mitigating factors presented by the defence was that the victim had initiated the argument, and had made a racial slur against Gill.

Not getting into the justice of this (I personally believe that minor ""provocation"" is given far to much credit in English justice for violent offences), just that I believe some provocation was taken into account in the sentencing. Entirely unprovoked random assaults (eg going and hitting a totally unknown person out of the blue) attract higher sentences.

I believe Bath has a very high ranking in business and I found the teaching good though not overly challenging compared to most of the comp sci units I was taking.

School of business is quite large as well and the people I knew from living in halls (dorms) who did business all seemed to have quite a few friends on the course. My guess is this is down to the nature course which frequently has team/group based assignments which makes it easy to meet people.

The campus is quite compact and there are quite a few social areas available where people hang out. Most are pretty friendly in my experience especially at the start of the year when no one knows anybody and everyone's looking to make new friends.

There are also a lot of [clubs](http://www.bathstudent.com/sport/clubs/) and [societies](http://www.bathstudent.com/socs/). to get involved in which is a good way to meet people who like the same sort of stuff as you. 

As far as venturing around to travel, I guess that's down to your friendship group. We would often go to stay at friends parents' houses which tended to be spread around the country. I had friends in Oxford, Hereford, London, Cambridge, Bournemouth, Bristol and Cardiff so we would take day trips or weekend trips there and crash at their place.

true,Herringgull,cnty-scotland,Tea-powered,"Absolutely. A bag of salad is going on for a quid, I can get 4 packets of noodles that will feed me 4 days of lunch for the same price.....

I've noticed carbs really seem to be the cheapest option; I live on rice, noodles and tatties, and the only greens I can afford are leeks, broccoli and spring onions. Also frozen peas because they keep.

Things like peppers are too expensive- at 85p each, or I could buy a 3-pack which is financially more economical but then I have to think of at least 3 meals involving peppers, and maybe I only want to eat 1 meal with them. 
Better to choose a tin of Lidl sweetcorn which I can get for 35p and make last for 3 meals. Again, it's not as healthy an option, but it is better than nothing.

Cheap meat is generally not great, corned beef seems to be an exception but it's full of salt so not something you want to eat too many days a week. 
Mince is cheap, I get 500g for £2.89 in Lidl and can make that go 2-3 meals for 2 people. Chicken however is far too expensive, unless I get a whole bird and butcher it myself.(which I think more of us should so, as just buying breast is wasteful) Fish is absolutely beyond what I can afford.

You learn where all the cheap food is; right now Farmfoods do the cheapest Branston beans at £1 for 3 tins, Home Bargains, B&amp;M and Lidl. 
When you compare their prices to the likes of Tesco (who charge £4 for the same mince I get in Lidl for £2.89) it's mad- actually it's a huge task to learn the cheapest prices, and then walk everywhere to get the cheapest things.
Planning your meals only works to a point- if the cheap thing you were going to eat is sold out, then tough it might just be the mac and cheese in a box for tea. You're tired and skint and can't think beyond the churling in your stomach. Or if an unexpected bill pops up and wipes out most of your money.

You learn, you adapt but you can't always plan ahead. You need a degree of financial stability for that. And that's not an option.

Then in my current job I was put under undue stress and broke down I was then referred to a  occupational health psychiatrist whom within five mins said 'I have good reason to you are biploar' and was disgusted by the way GPs had treated me. (Also prior an NHS psychiatrist just said I was a paranoid person and said there was nothing they could do).

Now that I know my condition I am able to work properly and understand my behaviors and urges and how to control them.

If you feel you gp is not listening and you are working ask to be reffered to occupational health psychiatrist.

Your gp should refer you to a psychiatrist anyways, and offer  counseling or CBT therapy.

I hope it goes well with your gp, if it doesn't just ring your local mental health NHS clinic and explain your situation. They will see you asap.

I agree that 4 years is a long time, half a year in prison would be hell in my eyes. But 4 years in a case like this is not enough.

The man might not have intended to kill. But he made a conscious decision to assault him, assaulting him from a position where he was in no harm at all.
You don't punch a man in the face like that if you don't want to cause him serious harm.
If you decide to punch a man in the face with that sort of force, you will always be running the risk of killing them. 

If this was a self defence situation, I'd agree with you. If you punch someone who is trying to punch you and accidental kill them, then I believe you shouldn't be punished as heavily. 

But it wasn't. He could have walked away like his bicycling buddy (who, for what it's worth should get off the fecking pavement.) gone about their day. But he decided to hit a man and that took his life.

Like you, I'd like to see people contribute to wider society where possible instead of sitting in prison. But this guy was also sentenced to 6months for other offences, 6 months isn't an insignificant amount of time. Dare I say someone who has already committed a crime worthy of 6 months (and actually being locked up for it. Big difference between the possible punishment and the actually punishment. Look at drug possession for example.) and then punches another man in the face isn't going to contribute anything at all to society?

Not everything is a mental health issue. You can be a completely sane, mentally lucid person that simply enjoys watching other people suffer. 

In fact, a [lot of studies \(this one Canadian\)](http://www.torontosun.com/2012/08/28/psychopaths-not-mentally-ill-say-canadian-researchers) point out that psychopaths are not mentally ill. 

Everytime something evil happens people on this sub say ""mental health"". Mentally ill refers (under criminal law) to the fact the person committing the act is ""incapable of distinguishing right from wrong"". 

Whilst more people recognising mental illness is a thing (as it's been ignored for decades and still is taboo to a degree) it is not right to assume every bad thing happens because someone is mentally ill. Serial killers and rapists are not mentally ill. They know right from wrong. 

There's as much chance that this person just lusts for power and rape is one of the most powerful/dominating things you can do to another person. 

&gt;Meanwhile, the psychopaths among us are difficult to detect because they don't show any of the signs doctors expect to see in mentally disordered people, such as neurological or developmental problems, lower intelligence and difficulty interacting with others.

I do actually think there should be a tougher sentence because this person initiated violence and I think that is enough without trying to imply that a greater level of malevolent intent existed.

Make sure you know your NI number, and be prepared to be put onto ""emergency tax"" code when you start paid employment, as you're unlikely to be able to provide a P45 -- you will get the overpaid tax back after a few months, though.

Combined sight and hearing loss can have a major effect on your confidence, having been here now for a little over a year, it's apparent that the work done here has positive effects on that side. 

This being said, we are bigger that your average bear when it comes to charities (in terms of turn over). Where we differ from the big shots is that we keep a seemingly small charity mentality, focusing on helping our members out for today, rather that investing masses of time in lobbying for change for tomorrow.

No, only the Doctor furthest along in the timeline remembers the meeting. They're the main timeline, so to speak, the others simply anchor on when they arrive and off when they leave. Or in other words, these events take place in the older Doctor's timeline, not in the younger one's. 

So, first of all he doesn't remember.

Secondly, he's a Timelord so he can live indefinitely. The Curator could be so far away writers never have to worry about it.

Also, time can be rewritten so even if he remembered, it wouldn't make a difference.

Last but not least, only TV/Movie is canon. Sometimes novels and comics are referred to, incorporated or otherwise reproduced, but yet all the same.

Another great thing about the Chinese wholesalers is that you can get herbs very cheap, in lieu of many ingredients you can make simple things taste much better!

Lidls chicken thighs are great! Meat on the bone has such a great flavour and texture, and you can do meals like jerk, or sweet mustard glaze, or blackened Cajun rub. 
Their fresh meat is just the same as what you find in the big supermarkets but just at a more reasonable price. 


A whole chicken you can either take it apart before cooking, then you've got 2 breasts, 2 goujons, 2 wings and 2 thighs, plus you can keep the carcass to make a stock and strips the remaining meat off the bird to make a soup.

Or roast the bird whole on day 1. Take 1 breast between 2 people (shred with a fork it comfortably feeds 2) pad that out with tatties, leeks and some peas and have a chicken dinner.

Day 2, strip the cooked meat from the bird, get a sachet of white sauce, boil rice and mix the sauce and rice, add some peas and you've got chicken supreme.

I keep all the stripped meat in a bowl in the fridge, you can add a little to the noodles to make them more rich, or mix in some mayo and have as sandwiches.

The carcass, leeks and again some rice makes a cock-a-leekie, just add some cheap chicken stock cubes to make the flavour a bit richer.

""borrowing"" a trolley is theft. At the point you have to say you have the break the law to shop economically you've lost the argument.

This is essentially the poverty trap, in order to be economical with your shopping you need to spend money. Not just on bags, but herbs, spices, storage containers to freeze portions.  Which you don't have, as you're living hand to mouth week to week.  

Perhaps food banks should start offering rucksacks and tupperware and spices. Or should buy these bulk foods and resell them in smaller portions at cost.  Enable people to help themselves rather than just give handouts.

I'll be sharing a flat with two others, so i'll be able to have them help me out with this and anything related to it.

How does that compare to your university? Bear in mind that Edinburgh is a fairly small city even by British standards so the university has quite a big impact on Edinburgh as a whole - spends something like £700m a year.

You'll encounter loads of accents here due to the large number of EU and international students, and regional variation within the UK. I'd like to think that actual Edinburgh accents are fairly easy to understand as are a lot English ones (and there are a large number of North Americans studying here as well) but you may hear the occasional broad Scottish accent which, even though I've lived her all my life, I still struggle with sometimes. You'll get used to them all soon enough, though.

As has already been said you're going to notice a big change temperature wise. If it ever got as high as 43 in Scotland we'd probably all melt away, c.25 in the height of summer is about it. Edinburgh generally doesn't get much lower than -5 in winter but you will have a lot of rain and wind to put up with, so invest in a warm waterproof jacket (umbrellas are next to useless at times). Humidity is slightly different as even in winter it can approach 100% humidity and it's not unusual to get that for days on end in the summer.

In the midst of the free-agency frenzy, I've revisited [the work I did last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1hvjh7/what_if_salary_was_based_on_actual_performances_a/) to update it with this year's data. 

It will be presented in **two parts**: 

- **Part 1:** *You're reading it now*, it's the team-by-team presentation, the principles and methodogy behind the work as well as Top 20 and Bottom 20 for a lot of variables

- **Part 2:** *Tomorrow*, Analysis of all the data (which you would be able to download) presented today, on the angle of the effects of the current CBA. 

*Please use [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) for optimal reading*


---

**Principle**

---

The basic idea is to look at **how salaries within each NBA team would look like if players were paid based on their performances for the season** (through Win Shares), and from that make observations of the effects of the current CBA and add to the discussion about what


[Win Shares](http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html) is an advanced stat that measures a player's contribution to it's team results. 
Since the **sum of each player's Win Shares within a team is roughly the same to the actual wins of the team**. According to its creator *""since the 1962-63 season, the average absolute error is 2.74 wins""*, on the data this year is [at 3.23 wins](http://i.imgur.com/OCS1oRD.png) compared to [last year's 2.53](http://i.imgur.com/IFQEt1I.png) wins.

It's a good way to measure each player's value to the team, and to compare it to each player's salary, since they are **both distributed across a roster which makes it easy and relevant to take a look at those two variables.** 

It's important to understand that the adjusted salaries ***do not*** correspond to what a player is worth in the open market, but what he is worth ***to his team***. 

---

**Methodology**

---

A few more points of the methodology used to attribute salaries and Win Shares:

- Every player counting against the cap for more than $100,000 is listed, even those out for the season with injuries. 

- Regarding traded players, the Win Shares of a traded player on his old team follow him just like his salary.  For example Spencer Hawes had 2.6 WS with the Sixers and 1.9 with the Cavs. His line reads 4.5 WS on Cleveland's roster. 

- Players waived during the season and then signed to a new contract were counted twice: once with the waiving team (with the corresponding salary, in blue in the charts) and another with the new team (with the smaller salary)

- Players who had negative Win Shares were given a $0 adjusted salary since it doesn't make sense to give negative salaries. This means that the salary for the rest of the roster was calculated on the positive Win Shares total. (e.g. 97.5% instead of 100%)


- All the data is from [Basketball-Reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com/). As such the age used is the one at the start of the season. 

---
**Things to have in mind**

---

Some additional informations to have in mind while looking at the results :

- For that last category as for the all the other numbers, salaries **are based on performances within their own team**, *not* what each player would worth in free agency

- Win Shares is a good metric but **like every other one out there it's fairly limited when it comes to evaluating defense**.  Defensive Win Shares are part of the Win Share formula, but they tend to reward more often than not bad defenders on good defensive teams (like Boozer) over good defenders on bad defensive teams (like Anthony Davis)

- They were a lot of comments last year about injuried and waived players skewing the results. The philosophy here is the following: **if you're not playing, you're not performing.** Every dollar spent on a waived player or a guy out for the season is a dollar the guy playing 82 games on a minimum contract deserves but will not see. 

- This year I've added Top/Worst 20 lists **without rookie deals** and **with veterans (players over 30) only**. The veteran one is straightforward but for the rookie deals I did with the best of my knowledge, so there's surely a few that should be left out.

**League-Wide Best/Worst**

**Labels used**

---

- **WS/48:** Win Share per 48 minutes, like per 36 minutes indicative of the level of a players based on by minute production Usuful for taking in perspective bench and injuried players' Win Shares. 

- **WS:** Win Shares. Already explained earlier

- **WS% :** Part of the total Win Shares gained by the player

- **Salary:** 2013-2014 salary with the last team the player has been. 

- **Sal. % :** Part of the total salary salary earned by the player

- **Adj.Salary:** Adjusted Salary, what each player would earn if its salary was based on Win Shares 

- **Difference:** Difference between Adjusted and actual salary

- **Var:** Variation between Adjusted and actual salary

- **Cap salary:** Player's actual salary if every roster had to comply with the cap ($58,044M)

- **Adj Cap Salary:** Adjusted Cap Salary. Since each team has a different total salary, the adjusted salary only tell you this much. A 10 million salary on the Sixers is vastly different from 10 million on the Nets. 

- **Difference:** Difference between Adjusted Cap Salary and Cap Salary



---

**Random Observations**

---


- The plateau for Win Shares comes sooner that the one for salaries, making it very hard for well paid players to look good in the calculations: **only 6 players in the Top 50 salary list would make more money if their salary was based on Win Shares** : *Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kevin Love, James Harden and Joakim Noah*

- Paul Millsap, often called the best contract in the league, was surprisingly one the most appropriately paid players this season. 

- Andris Biedrins is 27 years old.


- Derek Fisher should have earned more money this past season according to Win Shares. 


- That Philly roster...My god. They are also the reason I put a $100,000 minimum. Otherwise they would be closer to 30.

Because women weren't allowed to fight in wars. The theory of patriarchy doesn't posit that being male is awesome and being female is terrible, but that society has traditionally reinforced gender roles that give men positions of power. In a patriarchy, men are empowered while women are protected and coddled.

Exactly.  That's why I have an issue with this whole ""educate"" approach to reducing sexual assault rates.

*Rapists know it's wrong to rape*. They simply don't care, or they are too drunk or drugged up or whatever.  The idea that you can ""educate"" men (or women I suppose) not to rape is absurd and frankly dangerous.

All we can do is protect ourselves as best we can (which is course now considered ""victim shaming"") and hope that most of these people will be extracted from society and put into treatment programmes after more minor assaults than progressing to the full rape/torture/murder.  

You have to wonder if this 14-year-old had showed signs of disturbing behaviour before, even perpetrated other assaults. It seems unlikely he was perfectly normal and inoffensive and suddenly all-out-rape. Most/many offenders tend to progress and increase in their criminality.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; It's also a giant pile of horseshit since last time I checked the majority of programming wasn't spent on exclusive subsections of license fee payers, but was intended for the general audience. If Scotland genuinely are getting £175m of custom content on top of full access to the entire range of BBC programming, then they're already getting a fucking amazing deal that they would never be able to match themselves anyway.

The £175m is £100m spent on 'Scotland only' content and £75m spent on national productions produced in Scotland.  The BBC pays £60m a year for premier league highlights.

&gt; The more I hear about the whole stupid idea, the stupider it sounds. But hey if a few racists want separation because ""fuck da tories!!"", good luck to them, and sorry that the more sensible residents of Scotland will have to suffer alongside them.

This is a very English point of view and not one that is shared in Scotland.  They don't want to 'fuck da tories', they want a greater control over their future by allowing them to vote in their own government.  Unfortunately the view down south of the border of the 'racists' is one of the main reason that Scotland wants to decide its own future and not have to follow the Little Englander attitude of the South East draining resources into London.",0,1393420668,null,0,false,0,cfp4qjc,t3_1yzel3,t1_cfp4qjc,t1_cfp45ed,null,1432566957,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

There have been numerous tragedies, including the Gate 7 tragedy which is perhaps the most famous. Supporters of their rival team are not allowed to come because it always ends in riots and fights. Often times, toilet paper, flares rocks, and even seats are thrown on the pitch. In the last paragraph Tony Cottee said 

""I'd have to say it probably is. You hear a lot about various places and the atmosphere there but when you go you realise it's not all that... But this place is the real deal.""

&gt; His age is showing; he's inconsistent

No he isnt. You made this up.
Since bentaleb started playing for us on the 22nd of December he has had three poor games - vs City, Dinipro and Norwich. In that time frame:
 Dawson has had poor games vs City, Dinipro, Hull, Norwich (4)
Eriksen has had poor games vs City, Everton and Arsenal (3)
Adebayor has had poor games vs Arsenal, Norwich and city (3)
Lennon has had poor games vs Palace, Swansea, Hull, Everton, City, Arsenal and more. (6+)
Vertonghen has had poor games vs Dinipro and Hull (2)
Sigurdsson has had poor games vs City, Southampton and West Brom (3)
Chiriches has had poor games vs Arsenal, West Brom and Palace (3)

and I could go on....

That is 7 players who have had as much or more poor game than Bentaleb since Bentaleb started playing for us. Most of these players have played less games than Bentaleb also. All of these players are therefore statistically more inconsistent than Bentaleb.

You have therefore made up this point to suit your agenda.

&gt; and teams are starting to focus on attacking him when he's in possession;

You made this up. You blatantly made this up to suit your agenda. Bentaleb has one of the best pass completion of anyone on our team. He also showed vs Southampton how good he is at by-passing opposition who put him under pressure - hes arguably on of the best at our team at doing it, here is a little reminder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_--50HxqA5I

And by the way Bentaleb had the second highest pass accuracy on the pitch with 92%. 

You are completely factually innacurate once again.

&gt; It's Sherwood's fault, for putting a 19 year old kid out there to try and match up with seasoned veterans

Bentaleb has been was named man of the match vs Everton by NBC and MOTM by just about everyone vs Newcastle. That is two of his last three PL matches - yet you have stated that it is Sherwoods fault?? Its to his credit that he has played Bentaleb.

&gt; he's going to get caught out and abused. And that's starting to happen very, very regularly.

No it inst you have made this up once again. For the last three goals we have conceded: Vs Hull - It was Dawsons fault for rushing out and Vertonghens for losing long
Vs Dinipro - Capoues fault for being caught upfield, Dawsons for losing his man and Vetonghen for making a rash tackle
Vs Norwich - Bentalebs for losing the ball, Dawsons for not holding the line and Rose's for losing his man. 

Are these players all out of their depth and getting abused very, very regularly? Because by your logic they are.

And btw, Im quite curious.. Bentaleb has been named motm in two of his last three PL matches - yet you have stated that he is starting to get abused very, very regularly.. 

You are factually acccurate yet again.

This is some of the biggest load of agenda driven tripe ive heard on here in along time. You have provided no justificaton for anything that you said.

Of course. Individual human beings really aren't very important unless the values they hold are worthwhile. There've been approximately 107 billion human beings so far. 107,000,000,000. I don't place inherent value in the life of a human, I place it in their worth as I judge it, a large component of which is based on the value of their cultural and philosophical beliefs. In the grand scheme of things, from a non-personal perspective, human life is eminently replaceable.

&gt;You are punishing children and the voiceless for the actions of people they cannot effect.

Oh nonsense. *Acts and Omissions* has my back on this one. I'm not punishing anyone. I'm just saying I don't want to help prop up a country which has a culture which largely hates gay people for being gay because that's a shitty culture and I don't want it to exist and so I see no reason to support the existence of people who hold it. If they survive then good for them, maybe they'll stop being shitty human beings at some point, but I see no reason that my money should be spent in the hope that they might choose to stop being shitty at some distant point in the future when it gives me no benefits but brings about a disadvantage to me (that is, I have to share a planet with these people).

Paulinho dominates one game and then will be invisible the next. Danny Rose looks like the best player on the team some weeks and others he can't mark, cross, and turns it over a ton.

Seriously how many players on spurs this year would you say have truly been consistent?

While some of the complaints regarding Bentaleb are accurate, most of them seem to be made without looking at his performance in regards to the rest of the team. Yes Bentaleb played badly in the Norwich, Dnipro, City and Arsenal games. BUT SO DID EVERYONE ELSE! We didn't lose those games because bentaleb played inconsistently, we lost cause the whole team sucked it up.

As for the part about Bentaleb getting ""caught out and abused"" I have seen our entire back line caught out and abused all season long and some of them are very seasoned veterans so I don't think age really matters there.

WPP is the biggest ad-buyer in the world. They have been buying up their competition for some time. Worryingly, they are now responsible for something like 40% of Channel 4's ad sales. There was a big tizzy a while back when WPP refused to renew their contracts with CH4. Why? Because WPP has now moved into funding and sponsoring their *own* content, and was strong-arming CH4 into commissioning it. What does this mean? Essentially an hour-long commercial.

Watching our squad, the player on the ball often stands still (or Mousa tried to move the ball up the pitch himself), while the other 4-5 players in the vicinity simply watch and wait for a pass to come to them.  We don't try runs behind defenses like other squads.  We don't look for an occasional pass over the top of the defense and try to catch them out.  We just push the ball up into their box, then attempt to cross it in poorly, or just go to the end line and hope to pass back to someone who has an opportunity to shoot.

No, it's not. The principle behind it is that if everyone pays, everyone gets it for less, and everyone subsequently gets far more VFM.

No - but that's because you've been given special provision for (what I assume is) a green car. A closer example would be 'do you pay Council Tax? Why? You haven't needed the Fire Service, NHS, Dustmen this month; why are you paying for stuff you don't use?

&gt;The difference with the NHS is that you are legally obliged to pay, if you don't you're a tax evader and will go to prison.

That's the difference in penalty, not principle.

More importantly, Scotland has HMNB Clyde, which includes the home of our nuclear deterrent submarines, Faslane, and the Coulport ""depot"" which is basically an armoured storage and loading base for Trident nuclear warheads and other explosives.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; Actually I meant 2 things, but to address your concern about taking from people who make it, the vast majority of .01%ers inherit their money, so the only thing they have done to earn it is to be born into the right family. The other part of what I meant was that we are becoming more efficient at producing wealth by your definition, the question is who should benefit from it? Oh yes, ""Virtually unlimited"" is my way of saying effectively unlimited, just trying to avoid scaring you with the concept. Read up on current and projected concepts for asteroid mining and solar energy farming.

Well I believe that when people earn money they are allowed to give it to who they like, and much of the time it will be their children. It might be unfair that some are born wealthier than others, but it's no more unfair than some being born with better genetics than others, and I've yet to hear calls for an egalitarian eugenics programme. Retention of wealth in free markets ultimately relies on providing it for others, and punitive taxes against the rich tends to be counterproductive in raising living standards in the long term.

""Very cheap"" is not the same as unlimited. A resource can be tremendously plentiful and still be scarce in the absolute sense, which is where economics comes in.

&gt; As a general rule of thumb, there is no such thing as useless research, just research we haven't yet found a use for. This counts double and more for research with any relevance into space travel etc. Ignoring any possible concerns over tinfoil-hattery, the sheer increase in work being done would outweigh any concerns about lack of direct specificity.

There is definitely such a thing as useless research, and the number of things one could potentially research will always be exponentially larger than there are people with the time and competence to research them. This is an essential economic fact of science and education.

&gt; The major problem with medicines currently is the patent roll-over, where pharmaceutical companies change the formulation of a viable medicine that is coming out of patent, in order to claim a new patent or prevention of duplication. This 'patently' [sorry for the pun] goes against the concept of the free market, yet is allowed by virtually all developed countries. This problem is duplicated in most major industries in one manner or another. I think I mentioned earlier that we don't actually have a free market economy anyway.

We've a mixed market economy, but some sections are fairly free of regulation. I'm not familiar with the patent system or nationalised health care in general so I'll refrain from commenting.

&gt; Probably. I go with kids screaming at parents day in day out for the latest in some form of brand-name goods to be coercion.

coercion
kəʊˈəːʃ(ə)n/Submit
noun
1.
the action or practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.

Seems your definition is somewhat unorthodox. No force or threat is used in encouraging children to buy products. Is there a great deal of peer pressure? Sure. But it's still not coercion. Nobody forces you to buy anything.

&gt; It might not, I wouldn't know. We haven't had a free market in a long time, if ever. What I do know is that under the current legal system hoarders flourish, as do bankers, politicians and other associated law-makers. One hand washes the other, the system is inherently corrupt. Who can fix it? No one in a position to fix these problems have any interest at all in solving them. I'll spare you my comments on political class.

Where's your evidence that hoarders are flourishing? Hoarding money tends to devalue it in the long term, so the financial industry has every incentive to invest, if only in low risk ventures. Your comment reads like a generalised ""fuck the man"" statement, but bankers flourishing is not necessarily bad for the economy as a whole, and can often be good for it. Politicians are incentivised to win elections, and often achieve it through superficial or short-term initiatives, but that's an inherent flaw with democracy. There is no such thing as an inherently uncorrupt system, either, merely different degrees of corruption. 

Much of our disagreement comes from basal economic facts (particularly regarding scarcity) and toleration for flaws in a given system. I don't believe we are moving towards a post-scarcity society in any sense, and I remain unconvinced by other methods of responding to the scarcity. I certainly agree our political systems are flawed, but I don't regard them as improvable right now (though I would support a move to proportional voting and increased local powers).

I disagree completely and wholeheartedly.

You can take any 1930s Daily Mail article and swap ""Jew"" for ""Muslim"" and it matches their present output. The reverse process also works just as well.

Here's [an example from 1938](http://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/0/75/13/81/201310/ob_9ef5e6_german-jews-pouring-into-this-country.jpg), changes are in italics:

&gt; &gt; “The way stateless *Muslims* from *the middle east* are pouring in from every port of this country is becoming an outrage...the number of aliens entering the country through back door, a problem to which the Daily Mail has repeatedly pointed” 

If you check the image I linked for the original you can compare it with [this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2451567/Bank-managers-check-customers-illegal-immigrants.html) recent story where they make similar demands.

Which usually means they're not valid. It made me laugh when Sky introduced the idea of having even more adverts *for your own channel* either side of the existing adverts; this decision appears to have been based on the assumption that we were used to adverts and wouldn't mind more.

&gt;It's not astonishingly good, it's not even decent. It's very bad.

Which you could say about the NHS. I don't use A&amp;E. I don't use perscriptions. I don't use my GP, really. Why am I paying for all these services I never use? If only there was a private alternative (Etc.)

&gt;This is plainly laid out by TV Licencing.

That's the legal requirement. It didn't work for all those people that rioted because they didn't think they should start paying for council services (when it was only homeowners that did via rates), not sure why you think it's still valid now.

&gt;but what I do not understand is the vehemence behind thinking that everyone should.

Because the excuses rolled out to not do so are usually self-centred and crap. And after reading this thread, they still are.

&gt;By 'costs nothing', I mean 'costs nothing for the user', perhaps that should have been clearer.

They cost nothing for the user based on the assumption that we're all paying the license fee. Being able to then utilise that service and at the same time pretend that you're perfectly in the right to do so reduces the money they have to provide new shows, etc., and drive us towards the likes of Sky, who of course provide vastly superior content (/s)

ninja edit
&gt;As a mark of gratitude for the respect shown, Olympiacos fans created their own banner that read ‘JUSTICE FOR THE 96’ and hung it on the Gate 7 section of their ground. It’s a banner that can be seen at every game – not just for the match against Manchester United.

&gt;Another large banner, not shown on TV, but bearing both club crests, reads: ‘Brothers, you show us the way - 21+96 - You’ll Never Walk Alone’.

Find some smaller online publications willing to pay for articles and send them some samples.

This is a great way to build up a portfolio of written work so that you can start applying to major publications. 

Learn a bit of photoshop and print design so you can improve your articles with visuals, photo compositions, and even basic infographic elements. This will add so much to your articles and really make them stand out, and can be a huge plus when it comes to applying for the big boys.

As for paper magazines, I would be wary. They are a dying medium, and don't pay much more than a good online 'zine. As with all things, prove you can do the work and get a name for yourself.

2. Would be lovely, but I don't think its going to happen.

3. I have mixed feelings about this one. I like the concept of Valdes here at LFC due to his experience at Barca but that would mean Mignolet wouldn't be starting as much. My personal opinion is that Mignolet is still young and he can learn quite a bit from Valdes or even Reina, for that matter in terms of ball distribution if not shot stopping. So, if Reina is still here next year, I don't see Valdes coming.

4. I rate Milner and he would be a good addition to the squad, if it happens. We need a bigger squad for next year, anyway.

Ok two things here.

A) This does apply to Parker. However this wasnt your point in your original comment. You were trying to claim that Bentaleb is this massive liability who teams are constantly trying to get at him and exploit, however considering he gives the ball away less than pretty much anyone else on our team and is arguably the best player we have at receiving the ball under pressure (The southampton match being the most obvious example, and this gif being another example!) this quite clearly is a both a woeful tactic and a tactic  which simply has not being used - you have being fictitious in claiming so IMO.

B) Here is analysis of Bentalebs passing vs Hull and Palace: http://soccertofootball.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/bentaleb-and-soldado-not-all-doom-and-gloom/
Look at his performance vs Newcastle - he was very effective there at transitioning from defense to attack and of course got two assists.

&gt; you clearly don't think the kid can do anything wrong

This is not true. I stated on here that he should not start vs Norwich due to his performance vs Dinipro and due to the fact that he would likely be tired after that match. (Factually incorrect again)

&gt; But you can't deny he was caught out for the Norwich goal

Yes he was caught out, as was Dawson and Rose.. As were capoue, Dawson and Vertonghen vs Dinipro, as were Dawson and Vert vs Hull...
PLayers make mistakes. This isnt a pattern with Bentaleb - Norwich was the exception. 

&gt; I don't care who NBC thinks the man of the match was; Dempsey got man of the match last year in a number of games in which he was utterly irrelevant because gasp NBC's man of the match is a FACEBOOK POLL

Dempsey was voted motm by NBC because most of the voters are American and are therefore bias towards him. Why would these voters feel biased towards a French-Algerian?? How am I grasping at facts??

And btw Im quite sure that it was the commentator on NBC who named him motm but im not bothered checking that....

Considering my original comment had 2934 characters and this comment has 2412 characters I am quite clearly interested in having a discussion. Such a cop-out...

true,Karma9999,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt;punitive taxes against the rich tends to be counterproductive 

Usually as this currently leads to lawyers and accountants finding a way to avoid or mitigate those taxes. The same problem occurs on inheritance, capital gains, etc. The wealth is not being kept legitimately, in effect it's being stolen from the state. I can't recall the exact numbers but the amount of tax avoided/evaded would be enough to pay off the national debt within a couple of years. When that debt is causing austerity measures that harm the poor and vulnerable, justifying leniency and relief for the old-money rich becomes difficult. 

&gt;There is definitely such a thing as useless research

The research carried out for NASA's space program was thought to be useless on Earth, but it turned out to have massive real-world applications. Granted some really obscure research may have no visible benefits, but the vast majority of it will reap rewards in one form or another. 

&gt;the number of things one could potentially research will always be exponentially larger than there are people with the time and competence to research them.

Agreed, so you are in favour of increasing research? We've digressed a little here, but my belief is that the more we research nowadays, the sooner the benefits of that will be felt in society. One of the biggest crimes against humanity [excuse the hyperbole] was the USA cutting the federal grants to research stem cell technology during the Bush presidency. We are now 6 years on from there, and the findings from said stem cell research are coming out thick and fast, with findings promoting  longer life, treatments for cancer, dementia and various genetic illnesses expected to be available in the next twenty years. We could have been eight years closer to that. 

Regarding coercion, the advertising convincing children to effectively bully their parents into purchasing something was deemed coercive, requiring EU-wide legislation to reduce this in 2009. 

&gt;Where's your evidence that hoarders are flourishing? 

It's difficult to get billionaires to fill in online forms asking about their finances :p It's blatantly obvious in the current economic system that it takes money to make money, and that there are several cliques who enjoy a very close relationship with each other, sitting on each other's boards, investing in each other's companies etc. Sure they aren't tucking the cash under their mattresses, they are using it as discussed earlier, to maintain their own status, rather than to benefit society. A happy exception to this is Bill Gates, who's putting huge amounts of his self-made fortune into social projects. It's a pity there aren't more like him. 

I agree that there are different degrees of corruption, but I contend that the level of systemic corruption is far greater than people want to acknowledge. It could be described as the Old-Boys network, relating to private schooling [Eton etc] but I think that's a distraction, where kids go to school doesn't create the connections between very rich families, the connection is already there beforehand. As for ""fuck the man"", sure there's a level of that in me, though not as much as it used to be. seeing the system continue on through bad to worse does that. Answer me a question, which of the huge national sell-offs/privatisations since the Thatcher years actually came with any risk to the investors in that sell-off? The idea behind investment is that reward should compensate for risk taken, isn't it? If that's the case, where was the risk to the buyer in selling incredibly valuable national assets at dirt-cheap prices over to private corporations?

&gt;Much of our disagreement comes from basal economic facts 

Probably, I'm not an economist, I'm a nurse :p  To be fair though, I have been reading around this for along time. I'll happily tolerate flaws in systems, nothing is ever perfect, but when a flaw is found it should be fixed, not left to continue to haemorrhage wealth out of public use. And deliberately causing damage to public utilities in order to maximise personal wealth is not treated anywhere near as harshly as it should be. 
I suppose I remain optimistic about the future, despite having an awareness of how badly it could go. This leads me back to the question I asked earlier, let me rephrase it. 

How do you see the future of our global society going for the next.. 25 years or so?  What changes in our systems could be made to improve the general well-being of humanity? Are there any changes you see coming that will cause problems for the world in that time frame or longer?   I think given the tech curve is heading upwards quite nicely that we are heading towards a post-scarcity situation, t's just a question of how long. I'd say 50-100 years at the outside, but an awful lot depends on the way the very wealthy respond to it.  [/tinfoilhattery]

Our politics are flawed, obviously and always will be. The major improvement we could see in the very short-term is an increase in transparency for funding of political parties, and for politicians personal finances. Yes, that latter is intrusive, you could call it a price of doing business in politics. Proportional representation is an obvious evolutionary step in our political system, shame that a stepping stone towards it got so firmly screwed up in this government. Good grief, an essay. Have fun :)

Primarily a Rugby League charity (but links up with many sports/universities/communities. They've been at UCLAN today with boxer Adam Little speaking about mental pressure in your sport) set up to help men talk about and overcome depression and anxiety. 

Being from the North I'm sure you're familiar with the 'man up and get on with it' mentality that is normally passed down to us. State of mind is trying to get men to open up, talk about their problems and help them take steps towards a healthy state of mind again.

If it were a team of the season so far I'd stick Baker rather than Okore in there as Okore has missed most of the season but with a fultl fit squad he'd get in. I'm a big fan of Weimann so it was a hard choice to leave Albrighton out, I think he can play a big part coming off the bench however.

&gt;The concept of a **technocracy** remains mostly hypothetical, though some nations have been considered as such in the sense of being governed primarily by technical experts in various fields of governmental decision making. A technocrat has come to mean either 'a member of a powerful technical elite', or 'someone who advocates the supremacy of technical experts'.    [Scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist), [engineers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer), and [technologists](http://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/technologist) examples include these [technologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologist) who have knowledge, expertise, or skills, would compose the governing body, instead of [politicians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician), [businesspeople](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businesspeople), and [economists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist).  In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field.

Funnily enough I do actually agree with you that the BBC should, if they want to maintain seriously the license fee as credible lock down their iPlayer content for license fee payers although I don't have scorn and contempt for people who watch the iPlayer for free as you do. They don't view the BBC in the same way that you do and literally view it as just another TV channel. 

Apart from that they should offer people the chance to 'subscribe' to shows so people can watch what they want on the iPlayer. You want to just watch Doctor Who? You can buy into it only.

&gt;When it comes to the BBC they should sell programs. Funnily enough I do actually agree with you that the BBC should, if they want to maintain seriously the license fee as credible lock down their iPlayer content for license fee payers. I find it strange that they have chosen to not do so. Apart from that they should offer people the chance to 'subscribe' to shows so people can watch what they want on the iPlayer. You want to just watch Doctor Who? You can buy into it only. I also do not think that owning a television in the UK should require a license. A license should only be required for BBC services. It should function akin to say, purchasing Sky.

This is a sound idea.

Major results: Loss to United, draw with Chelsea, win over City and Spurs which is 7/12 from difficult top teams.

Others: Draw Sunderland (H), Westham (A).
  
We are bound to lose, and I get the feeling it will be United. Even when we play bad we used to beat them at Anfield, I think they will show up big time. Westham is due to their home form and defense also ensuring they avoid relegation, returning players from injury etc. Sunderland due to their desperation and big striker, long shooters etc. should be able to take a point. 
  
Also we are extremely good at coming back from bad results, so I consciously avoided putting together run of bad form. Other than the Chelsea result, we have a good record, which I'm half expecting based on the teams ambition. I have a feeling Suarez and Gerrard won't rest until it's mathematically impossible. 80 points probably won't be enough to win the league (Chelsea would have to take 20/33, unlikely even if we contribute to 3 of those point losses). but hopefully it is enough to get us top 3. If we continue our season average one of those draws needs to be loss so we get 23 points and hit our seasonal average.

true,WhatTheHabs,wardr,Hurt,"OK.  So here is what we know of Weeping Angels.

* 1.  two forms, stone and true (Blink)
* 2.  change from true form to stone when observed (Blink)

What we can gather from the first two points is that their stone form is not their true form, and that they only become rock when we observe them.  I'm sure we all knew that, but it's important to get the basics out of the way, in order to focus on the science of their true form.

* 3.  require energy to thrive (Flesh and Stone)
* 4.  start life as infants, and grow (Angels take Manhattan)
* 5.  have mobile appendages in ""other"" form (Time of Angels)

Alright, now from points 3 through 5, we see that their true form is probably physically unique.  I came to this conclusion through the fact that they consume energy, and those who don't are weakened, meaning they are capable of being superior to one another.  That leads us to the fact that they are not all identical clones in their true form, as compared to their stone form.  The fourth point refutes the belief some commenters made, that they may be beings pure energy and light.  If Weeping Angels can grow and mature, they probably aren't plasma-based beings because that is not a characteristic typically associated with that life-form in works of science fiction (AFAIK).  And just to really anchor that down as a fact, the fifth point tells us that their appendages are capable of moving and grabbing, as the Weeping Angels in ""Time of Angels"" killed Angel Bob and co. by snapping their necks.  Plasma-beings in scifi are known for ranged energy attacks.  Snapping a neck is a physical endeavor that requires higher-brain function and limbs (more than one) capable of moving individually and grabbing items.

OK.  So far, we have that Weeping Angels have a true form, and a stone form.  Their stone form is only revealed when we observe them, and is separate from their true form.  Their true form is probably not plasma-based, as Angels can grow and mature; become stronger through consuming energy; and have mobile, physical appendages.  Meaning their true form is indeed physical and tangible, and capable of reacting and changing.  This all points to, yes, we can attack their true form, and it must damage them in some way, as attacks damage all other creatures.   How much damage though?

* 6.  damage from bullets, in an amount that is lethal to human and other Earth lifeforms, does not actually harm them (Flesh and Stone)

Not much.  We see from point 6 that they will not die under a barrage of gunfire from what is essential a shooting squad, as none fell during the attack scene.  Meaning their physical form is stronger than other creatures of flesh, and it's probably not in your best interest to attack blindly verses running or keeping a good look out.  Which may also prove futile if you're alone, as their physical forms are extremely fast.

As for bleeding; no, Weeping Angels do not bleed.

* 7.  injured Angels do not bleed (Angels take Manhattan)

Point 7 comes from the scene in ""Angels take Manhattan"", where there is an injured Angel chained down to prevent it from escaping.  In stone form, the injury manifests as a crack in the statue.  In its true form, we see that it does not bleed, because when we cut back to stone form there is no blood on the floor.  So whatever their *very much physical* and *very much tangible* true form is, Weeping Angels probably do not have blood.  They probably have some sort of bodily liquid, as that's necessary to survive (by human standards), but not enough to leak from an injury.  What does that mean for their form?  I assume their make up is similar to a tree.  Not wood-based, but similar to Ents from Lord of the Rings.  Ents are physical life forms, they move, have mobile appendages, but also do not bleed.  Because trees don't have blood; they have body fluids, but not enough to leak from battle injuries.

SO, hope that's good enough for everyone.",0,1393434737,null,0,1393443543,0,cfpa3m0,t3_1yw9tz,t1_cfpa3m0,t3_1yw9tz,null,1432569485,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

In 1991, when Robert Runcie retired as Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican hierarchy was desperate for John Habgood, the deeply intellectual Archbishop of York, to succeed him. Aware that Mrs Thatcher would not be keen on another lefty in Lambeth Palace, they hatched a cunning plan to ensure his election. As the other candidate presented to the PM, they plumped for the one cleric in Christendom too plain thick for even Mrs T to choose. She would be less likely to select the evangelist bishop of Bath and Wells, they calculated, than the baby-eating usurer who held that post in Blackadder. They calculated wrong.

&gt; The abolition of private roads massively increased efficiency and quality while reducing costs.

I'm sorry, but I'm going to need several citations. As far as I'm aware, Wales was mired in poverty at the time of the Rebecca Riots because of GOVERNMENT ENFORCED tarriffs, particularly the corn laws. This is what incited the riots, not 'expensive toll roads'. The 'expensive toll roads' were simply one of a number a costs that the Welsh farmers were burdened with, many of which were GOVERNMENT MANDATED taxes (tithes and poor rates both increased along with the toll rates). The fact that the Welsh farmers took out their desperation on the toll roads was simply because they were the easist target. 

I mean, this is what governments do; they break your leg and give you a crutch to lean on. They caused much the of the extreme poverty, and then alleviated *some* of it. Brilliant.

&gt;

&gt;The **2000 UEFA Cup Final Riots**, also known as the **Battle of Copenhagen**,  were a series of [riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot) in [City Hall Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hall_Square,_Copenhagen) in [Copenhagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen), Denmark, between fans of English football team [Arsenal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) and [Turkish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) side [Galatasaray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football_team\)) around the [2000 UEFA Cup Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_UEFA_Cup_Final) on 17 May 2000. The scuffles, in which four people were stabbed, also involved fans from other clubs and were viewed by the media as part of a retaliation for the killing of two [Leeds United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.) fans by Galatasaray supporters the month before.

&gt;The events of the day started early in the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans occupied City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, the police were unable to control the riot until they fired [tear gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas) at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey in the aftermath of the riots.

&gt;The riots were condemned by football authorities with threats of expulsion of national football teams from European competition being given out if similar events happened again. The Danish police also were criticized for their handling of the riots.

true,BadHaders,,Year 11,"Sorry to necro this, but I just got the iGCSE presentation mark back and thought I should share some advice with people who are yet to take it :)  
All of my friends did controversial and advanced issues, like sexualisation of women in mass media, ethical issues of assisted suicide, and objectification of women and rape culture. These things WILL get you much better grades.  
My most important piece of advice is to do yours on something that you're knowledgeable about. If you're a horse person, for god's sake don't do it on your sunday horse riding, pick something intellectual, like moral issues with show horses and horse racing captivity.  
Also make sure that you present it as an argument, your ability to weigh up the issue will get you more marks. For mine I did this:  
Introduction - Outline argument  
Facts/Statistics - Explain your point, back up with quotes  
One side of argument  
Other side of argument  
Contrast the two sides and pick the stronger argument  
Conclusion  
My presentation was about ethical and moral issues of expecting user's data and breaching user's privacy within social media ToS.  
I researched and understood the argument, and even with 4 people and the teacher trying to rip holes in my points, I managed to keep a solid argument.  
I ended up getting 40/40, and was the only person who achieved this.  
Structure a solid argument about a controversial subject and you'll land an A/A* easily.  
Lastly, remember to consider possible questions! Your teacher and peers  will likely attempt to find flaws in your argument, be prepared for this!",0,1393435800,null,0,false,0,cfpalao,t3_1w82fv,t1_cfpalao,t3_1w82fv,null,1432569716,1,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,1

Go for it, embarrass yourself if you can get a better chance of winning. Chelsea and Liverpool won when they were shit at their league or had little shot at winning it. Push for it as if you have nothing to lose. (we probably can't as we aren't guaranteed CL, so my hope for next season would be getting out of group stages).

true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"Football supporters these days, are extremely reactionary. 

I think it’s easy to shoot off the hip out of frustration without rhyme or reason and with the Premiership exploding exponentially every year especially in the United States, there are more and more supporters who want to be part of the football narrative without looking green or naive. So it’s easy to follow the popular train of thought that's going on with the talking heads or social circles. That way, no one disagrees with you and you don't have to defend yourself if you disagree which would eventually out you. Comments like, ""What the fuck is Rodgers doing with the formation”"" or ""Why the fuck is Allen coming on for Sturridge?"" or ""Why is that shithouse Henderson playing so fucking deep when he should be up trying to score goals?"" You kind of want to ask, ""what formation are actually playing and why is it not working against Team X's formation and tactics?"" or ""Don't you notice we're getting run through the midfield putting our forwards on an island and Allen is coming on to slow play and hold possession to kill the Team X's tempo and momentum?"" or ""Do you see Johnson's getting torched by Player X so Rodgers has him shifted further out to give him more protection and to break up play?"" Very simple stuff, but yelling 'so-and-so' and so sucks is easier and it supposedly shows the pseudo passion of a supporter along with a few high-fives. 

As for Liverpool players, I don't think we'll ever learn our lesson. Fairly recent players like, Henchoz, Luis Garcia, Lucas, Henderson, etc. have been absolutely slaughtered by the so-called fans mercilessly to now have the same fuckers how slag them worship the very ground they walk on and say ""I've always backed him"" without batting an eye. Even players like San Jose and Insua have had brilliant careers after their time and Liverpool ended and they were ushered out the door to jeers. Now not every player will make it at Liverpool. Sucks, but that's life. I just don't see how booing or moaning when any Liverpool player comes on the pitch is productive in any way what so ever. If they're having a bad run of form or a bad match, it’s okay to be critical, but be fair and not site superfluous drivel to back anything up. That being said, I do enjoy watching certain people eat crow.

Liverpool supporters are the most knowledgeable supporters in the world and you meet them anywhere you go in the world without resorting to some of the discussions on /r/soccer. Shit. We have own beauts in this subreddit as well. Like a few said before, it was whinging that “we don’t have a chance in hell for top 4th” to “we’re going to win the league and if you don’t think so you’re not a true supporter” type thing. The mercurial joyride is a bit too much to take at times. But you can tell the difference between a sensible discussion and just the utter shit. The Anfield Wrap, The Tomkins Times, ROATL, etc. are some quality football forums to check out. Now you may not agree with them which is perfectly fine, but shows the sort of vernacular and standard that helps you delve into football further, not kick you out. 

Yeah, yeah. I’ll probably get downvoted to oblivion for this, but that’s reddit. Whatever. I just feel like it needs to be said. For fucks sake, we’re much better than this.

The last line in Al Pacino goes with a lot of things, not just football.

I've often thought if people just used totalitarianism instead of facisim it would clear up things, wikipedia actually defines it as a kind of subset of facisim after all.

But my point is again, people are very happy to separate out the broad terms of ideology when it suits them.  This isn't about oh communisim is evil.  Frankly I don't know why you even mentioned India.

Labour party members hate her because she threw Gordon Brown, a life-long friend, under the bus when she had a whiff of being PM, as well as jacking in any kind of left-wing politics if it stands in the way of her career advancement whilst veering back to the left when it suits. Her ability to absolve herself of blame was best exhibited during Ed Miliband's speech following winning the Labour leadership, when she raucously cheered his refutation of Iraq and David Miliband leant in and said ""why are you applauding, YOU voted for it.""

I also have a friend who was a Labour member until her attempts to change the equality act so that it was legal to discriminate on race and gender, which he saw as against the party's core principles.

My assertion is thus:  Just because something gets more mentioning, doesn't indicate prejudice.

There was something the other day about bias on the BBC where someone did something similarly awful, I think it was that by giving companies airtime in news programs, it showed a right wing lean.  So ripping on the director of some company for something is right wing lean now.

4 HD television channels (2 of which are 24 hour when 20 years ago they usually shut down for 3-4 hours depending on the night).

a 24hr news channel and a dedicated politics channel

A Gaelic language channel

A childrens TV channel

I did a crash course with car captain in 2012. 
At the time I was 32, came from mainland Europe, just moved to central London and really wanted to finally get my license. I was quite worried about driving on the other side of the road and going the wrong way into a roundabout potentially killing myself and others. 

I went for a [5 day intensive course](http://www.carcaptain.com/5Day_Intensive_Crash_Driving_Course.html), Monday to Friday, 3 hours each day and took the test on Saturday and passed without a problem. 

You have to apply for your learners permit beforehand though and do your theory. For the theory you just book an appointment and prepare by reading the book or, as in my case get the DVD from WHS. Don't stress yourself about the theory too much. Most of it is common sense, 10% at most, are things you need to really learn, i.e. speed limits, weight limits and such things. 

I highly advice you to to do your driving outside central London though, it is crazy here and I was really worried about it. Did my hours and test in Uxbridge, which in my opinion was a good decision, although the commute every morning to Northolt was a bit of a pain. 

Although tempting to go for an automatic, you really want to do your test on a manual, otherwise your license  will be ""automatic only"" which could be problematic if you ever want to hire a car or use a friend's car, as you are legally not allowed to drive manuals on automatic licenses. 

I think all in all I spend something around £600. 


**Below the review I wrote back then, hope I could help.**

After failing my practical test in the Netherlands shortly before my move to the UK, I was determined to get my drivers license in the UK as quickly as possible.

Being used to driving on the right side of the street, I was initially a bit worried how I would adapt to driving on the left. It´s not only the other side of the street, I also had to get used to shifting with my left instead of my right hand, getting used to sitting on the right side, which affected my clearance to other cars parked on the street since my perception of the with of the car was completely messed up and a constant fear of driving into a roundabout the wrong way.

Kaye is a brilliant instructor, effectively teaching me how to drive safe and confident on UK roads. After the first three hours I had a good feeling that I would be able to pass my test after completion of the 18 hours without much of a problem. Not only is she a very calm and thoughtful teacher, she also adapts her teaching style according to ones need. After the first two hours or so, she switched from a maternal to a rather paternal approach, which worked quite well with the way I think and learn.

Kaye is very passionate about her job and she really puts her heart into it, genuinely caring for her pupils.

I really enjoyed the time I spent with Kaye in the car. I am absolutely thrilled to have my license now, driving through the dense London traffic, knowing that Kaye thoroughly prepared me for all situations. I am a bit sad actually, since I really enjoyed ""working"" with Kaye. After 3 hours of driving for 5 days, you really establish a bond with her.

Kaye, thank you for all your hard work, the skills you taught me, the lovely conversations we had, the countless roundabouts you sent me through and thank you taking my hissy fits after those much hated reverse left turns with a smile and always a kind word.

If you want to get your license, drive with Kaye, she will whip you into shape and I mean this in the nicest way possible.

It's been a wet and windy couple of months - so check out the National History Museum (free - but there's a mammoth exhibit you'll need to pay for entry to). When you leave pop into Greyfriar's Bobby for a drink and a nosy at the famous statue.

There's castle of course, and Camera Obscura near there. The parliament building is pretty and there's Dynamic Earth there too.

Then head toward Prince's Street for a tour of the portrait gallery (free) and lots of overpriced bars and shopping. 

Haggis - don't be tempted to buy it from a bar or anywhere in the vicinity of the Royal Mile. Haggis is genuinely lovely if it's a good haggis. Be prepared to spend a bit of money (~£15) in a nice restaurant for a good haggis in Edinburgh.

Oh and take the train to Glasgow for a day if you want to go shopping :)

And in the evening go down the Cowgate and visit Sneaky Pete's or Opium for free entry, cheap booze, friendly people",0,1393441209,null,0,false,0,cfpd7cu,t3_1z09di,t1_cfpd7cu,t3_1z09di,null,1432571019,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3
