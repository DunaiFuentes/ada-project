The only thing i think he may have missed on was saying how Levy was content to be the top of the ""also-rans""....i legitimately think Levy wants to get CL simply because it is a massive stream of revenue to the club.

We just signed a shirt sponsorship with AIA that is rumoured to be somewhere between £80m - £100m over 5 years...that is an astronomical sum of cash for a team that has no titles and 1 CL appearance in the past 10 years. The only teams that roll up that type of sponsorship are teams that perennially compete for titles and appear in the CL...with the exception of Spurs.  Levy knows that if he can somehow get us into the CL with the current system in place he and Lewis will reap the rewards in terms of more merchandise, more sponsorships and additional revenue from CL TV rights. It is in his best interest for Spurs to make CL.

Our manager situation as you said isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be but it is still infuriating. We jump between continental and English mindsets and fill the team each time with personnel that fit either one or the other, but not both. We need to pick a path and stick on it even if we don't stick with the manager.

One of the things that makes me love the idea of LvG as our potential manager is the fact that he can help the team set a philosophy that we can stick with when he would leaves. We aren't ever going to be a big spending team, but if we could buy into a system at least we could be smarter about the moves we make.

As you said, we have done fairly well for a team that 10 years ago was in the relegation conversation.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt; One of the things that makes me love the idea of LvG as our potential manager is the fact that he can help the team set a philosophy that we can stick with when he would leaves. 

Not only that, but I think LvG is special in his own right. I think what Everton is doing with their youth set up, and what Barcelona's been doing that churned out world class players, will soon come to us if Van Gaal comes after the WC. The idea is that every level, from U-11s to the senior squad, play the same ideology (In Martinez's case, it's possession-based, I'd hope it'd be a mixture of that and a more threatening attack from us). I can see Van Gaal leaving out a much, much bigger mark than our rogues gallery if he's given time. 

&gt;i admit to being greedy and wanting us to be just a little bit higher

Absolutely. It wouldn't be Spurs if we weren't self loathing despite punching above our weight. Maybe it's a stable fourth in a few years, after that, we'll likely aim higher and higher. I think that's the Tottenham ethos in a nutshell.

&gt;Levy knows that if he can somehow get us into the CL with the current system in place he and Lewis will reap the rewards in terms of more merchandise, more sponsorships and additional revenue from CL TV rights. It is in his best interest for Spurs to make CL

Financially speaking, I think you're spot on with this. The cash benefits of even staying in CL qualifying rounds is bigger than winning the Europa League. It's incredible that Levy has actually managed to close that gap, sponsorships and all. 

&gt;We jump between continental and English mindsets and fill the team each time with personnel that fit either one or the other, but not both.

This effect is probably magnified at its worst when the manager's sacked in the middle of the season. Under AVB, gone were inverted wingers and a tight defensive unit. We saw a lot of this change when Sherwood came in. 

In terms of the backroom, I do have to disagree. Franco Baldini looks like he understands the Italian transfer market (We don't even know if Erik is worth the 30 million.), and we're moving generally into a more Continental style, with a head coach, technical director, etc. Frankly, I think that's the future. Someone like Moyes or Wenger is going to be a dinosaur in the current climate five years from now.

This proves my point. The team is more important that the individual. 

Barca would have won the same amount of trophies with Suarez as with Messi.

true,xgloryfades,null,null,"It's 5am here so don't expect too many replies for at least another few hours. I can't sleep so I'll sum up my (few) experiences so far. 


One good thing we have is the NHS direct phone line for non-emergency advice. I have TMJ (a problem with the joint in my jaw caused by grinding my teeth at night) and when it first developed it was awful. I couldn't close my mouth because it was painful and the joint just wouldn't budge, I also couldn't chew without ending up in tears and ate porridge, rice pudding and soup for a week. Anyway, you get the point: the situation was miserable. So I phone up this number, go through the standard assessment questions they have to ask and then explain the situation. They explain to me that it's a dental issue and give me a list of dentists in my area currently accepting new NHS patients. I phone one up and manage to get an emergency appointment for the next day. The dentist tells me what the problem is and does a mold for a gum shield there and then. I pick the gum shield up the next week, wear it to bed and the problem improves. The best thing was I was under 18 at the time and the whole thing was free (adults pay for dental but it is subsidised)

Another experience: last summer I got this freaky bite while walking through grass in bare feet. My whole left foot swells up and blisters to the point where I can't move my toes or wear shoes without pain. So after a few days of it not clearing up with antihistamines off to the walk in centre I go. I remember there were two other people in the waiting room. I go up to the desk and explain the issue. I'm seen within half an hour and a nurse examines the foot, lances the blisters and gives me aftercare advice. He tells me to come back if it doesn't improve and sends me home. 

I used to be very overweight and wanted to lose it safely. I didn't have much of an idea of how to go about it and mentioned it offhand to the doctor when I was there for something else. Turns out I could get monthly dietician appointments on the NHS. My dietician was lovely and enthusiastic, she gave me the advice I needed and we had weigh ins to monitor my progress and I gradually lost the weight. It was like weight watchers but free and less humiliating. 

Final story: (this took place in a university health service practice so it might be slightly  different but still NHS run). I was there for something unrelated when the doctor mentions one of my MMR jabs is missing, she gives me my prescription (free since I'm under 19 and on full time education!) and tells me to check my records next time I'm home. Next appointment I confirm the jab is missing from my vaccination book and she tells me to ask the receptionist for an appointment with the nurse on my way out. To my surprise I get my jab sorted just half an hour later. Free and easy. 

A lot here are very proud of it and it's truly a ""cradle to the grave"" type thing. I saw someone mention in an askreddit thread that people in America will break bones and beg not to have an ambulance called because of the cost. That just blows my mind. 

I know you hear all the ""it's not free because taxes"" arguments but when I graduate and(hopefully) find a job I'm okay with that because they've looked after me well so far. 

 You do hear stories of inefficiency, long wait times and bad care etc but I've been very fortunate so far and I think it may be to do with the area you live in. The walk in centre story was from the suburbs, inner city and I'm sure I'd have been waiting longer.

One point the article is making is that these people are so fucking rich that it's ridiculous that we still subsidise their income. In short, I think its in the public interest that these people lose their constitutional position - then they can fund their lavish lifestyles the same way other celebrities do. The royal family can still exist as a celebrity spectacle to entertain our American friends, we could still hire them to do ceremonial bullshit they same way we can hire former actors from Gladiators to open supermarkets. We're not going to get Colonel Gaddafi as president if we become a republic. Ireland has a perfectly functioning presidential system and a president who genuinely unites the nation. That works for me.

In 2005 S2's *The Christmas Invasion*, Tennant says this when his hand is cut off:

""Because quite by chance I'm still within the first fifteen hours of my *regeneration cycle*, which means I've got just enough residual cellular energy to do this. ""


And in 2005 S6's *The Impossible Astronaut*, River says the following after the Doctor is ""killed"":

""Whatever that was, it killed him in the middle of his *regeneration cycle*. His body was already dead. He didn't make it to the next one.""


Both of these imply that ""regeneration cycle"" *could* mean just the one, but in all likelihood it will mean a new set of 12 so that the show-runners don't have to deal with the lack of regenerations again for some time.

true,satanspanties,null,null,"It kind of depends what your problem is. For emergency and urgent medicine, they're great; you call an ambulance if it's an emergency and they'll sort you right out, and for everything else, you phone your GP in the morning and get an appointment the same day (although some GPs have different rules). If it's urgent (like a potential infection say) and all the GP appointments are full, you can go to a walk in centre and they'll check you put there. The advantage of this is that a lot of things can be seen and treated while they're still a little niggle, or you can just have your mind put at rest that it doesn't need treatment, there's no getting sicker while hoping it'll go away.

For other stuff, it can be a bit more hit and miss. If you get referred to a specialist department at the hospital, cancer patients, as you might expect, take priority over everybody else. Unfortunately for people with something else, that sometimes means waiting longer for appointments and treatment than is really ideal. Some choose to go private for this reason (make no mistake, private doctors are mostly exactly the same as NHS, I don't mean the same qualifications and experience, I mean physically the same person); there are fewer private patients and therefore shorter queues. While waiting for appointments, some patients may have blood tests etc done to monitor their condition, and be brought in urgently if something goes awry. This doesn't apply to things like serious complications of diabetes that need to be looked at by a doctor every couple of weeks, clinics might overrun by up to a couple of hours, but you'll be seen.

If you have a wound from an operation or a long term catheter or something like that, dressings and so on can be changed by the District Nurse, a nurse who comes to your house and does it for you there. Some individual nurses are better than others, but the service can be great for people who find travel difficult.

The biggest reason most people will always defend the NHS, however, is the cost. The NHS is not obviously not free (and I can't help but laugh at people who point that out like it's a revelation) it's free at the point of delivery, and everybody pays according to what they have. The US system, where you pay according to what you need preys on people's fears, and screws them over when they're most vulnerable; stressing over how you're going to pay for your care can only make you sicker.

When one of my friends stepped on broken glass on a Friday night. It was a busy night, and her injury wasn't immediately dangerous, but the staff were working efficiently enough to get to her in a quarter of an hour. 

I've heard about waiting times of a few hours but never closer than third-hand. The triage system works the same way that it does in the USA, but there are fewer people in the UK who use the ER as their sole source of medical care. This means that fewer people waste resources by going in trying to get things that should be provided by a GP, and fewer people end up in the ER from untreated injuries or illnesses that were originally minor.

Waiting times for non-emergency specialist appointments or surgery can be a few months long, as there are a limited number of specialists, operating theatres, and hours in the day. I expect the waiting lists to be longer in the UK, because the NHS covers those who would be uninsured or underinsured in the USA, but I have not checked whether this is the case.

Mental health care is underfunded on the NHS. There are too few beds available, especially for children and people with conditions like eating disorders who should not be in a general psych ward if possible. It is still covered.

GP surgeries are free to visit. You just call the receptionist and book an appointment. They will usually try to keep their rolls sized so that they have a couple of emergency appointments free per day.

Dental care is free for some groups of people, and subsidized for others. Orthodontic care is free for children, though there is a waiting list of several months. Dentists can predict when a child should begin orthodontic treatment, and put them on the waiting list so that they'll reach the top of the list at that time - this practice makes it difficult to compare this waiting list an others. I didn't actually wait a day, but officially I was on a waiting list for six months.

If a private hospital offers a necessary treatment or surgery that the NHS does not, the NHS will pay the private hospital to perform it on their patients. Private hospitals are usually used mainly to get non-emergency treatment more quickly, or to get nicer accommodation during a hospital stay. 

Everyone in the UK has decent access to comprehensive healthcare, from the Prime Minister to the homeless man on begging at the railway station. The level of care that is standard here is higher than many in the US can hope to get due to the outright cost or to high co-payments, and the NHS doesn't drive people to bankruptcy. Private healthcare here is an expensive way to get a hospital room with better décor and a shorter wait for rhinoplasty.

I can't answer everything but council tax is incredibly expensive, I'm paying a grand this year, and I never remember its coming up so always a nasty surprise at this time of year. 

Arranging it is easy, phone the council immediately and tell them where you have moved too. arrange a direct debit. Pay it monthly just after payday and its manageable and won't be a financial disaster. Nothing worse than when you realize your haven't paid any for six months and they want a LOT of money off you. 

Do this for all your bills and you will find you stay on top of your out goings. Leaving stuff for later or trying to be a smart arse and dodging paying will always come back to bite you. 

Rent could be as low as 250/M for a room in a shared House, up to as high a figure as you can think of for A whole house, you want to share to begin with anyway. Assume you will be paying out about 600/month for everything, put that aside so you stay on top of your finances. 

Make a second bank account or even better, an isa, and pay fifty quid a month into it automatically. You will appreciate having a slush fund many times in your life. 

When you move in keep a folder with all your correspondence in. Letters from the council and utilities, you will thank yourself later. 

Keep another one for important documents (passport paper drivers license etc)

Learn to cook a delicious vegetarian meal because it can be incredibly cheap. Get a good cook book (Nigel Slater fast food) and challenge yourself to cook one thing out of it a week. Girls love a fella that can rustle up something delicious. Doesn't have to be fancy, I got laid once because I make an excellent poached egg. 

Pot noodles are fine, keep one in the cupboard for when you are hungry and have forgotten to shop,  but don't rely on them. Same for take aways and kebabs. 

Find a way to make friends, this can be tricky as an adult and takes effort and a bit of a personal emotional risk on your part. You need to put the effort in and when you have found someone who you like you need to arrange stuff to do to move the friendship on. 

Join a club, play a sport, get a part time job in a bar. Sometimes you can just hijack someone else's friend group, but that doesn't always work.

As far as where to live? At your age you must know someone at uni? Move there and borrow their friends? 

I live in Norwich and did just that and it was a great way to get established. Everyone has left uni and moved on but I'm still here with a great group of friends etc. Of course only you can decide where to go.  A big city will have more stuff to do but can be more difficult to deal with. Would always say to give it a go though it you can. 

Its amazing and some of the best times of my life were just around your age when I moved out. Don't take everything too seriously, you've got plenty of time to head about and have fun. Boring shit like mortgages and stable monogamous relationships will happen naturally, enjoy your time before it all occurs.

Personal anecdote: a friend of mine was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer in our last year of school when he was 17. He received the best possible care with specialists from around the country coming to learn from (his rare condition) and treat him. He was provided with counselling (both for him and his family), he was connected to various charities, he was able to stay overnight in hospital in London whenever he was having treatment and all the staff made him feel very safe, secure and cared for. Fortunately, and because of the efforts of many people in university hospital London, he has been in remission for nearly 4 years now. He goes in for check ups every six months or so. All of this was covered by the NHS and the only things his parents had to pay for was petrol/train tickets to get to the hospital (and the teenage cancer trust helped them out with those anyway). 

Second anecdote: my grandfather was on his deathbed in 2011. Very ill from just being very old. The staff at Epsom hospital were phenomenal, they worked round the clock to ensure he was comfortable and that his family were able to see him and communicate with him before he died. Palliative care at its best. Ironically my mum works in palliative care and the staff at Epsom were even mentioned in the eulogy at the funeral. 

The NHS is an amazing institution and one of the greatest things this country has produced. It pains me to see its current privatisation because to me it seems like they're going about fixing all the bureaucracy in the wrong way.

2. Rodgers has had time to fully implement his ideas - our pressing is more consistent, more team-wide, and more organised this season. Moving Gerrard deeper has also helped us press, since now the front 5 are players with the legs to play the pressing game. We've also become deadly on the counter, a feature of Rodgers' Swansea side as well. Credit to Rodgers, he's also modified his ideas a bit, reducing the emphasis on death-by-possession when he realised that an element of directness suited our attacking players

It seems like the SW is way behind with 6%. But that's pretty much because they've lumped everything North of Nottingham together. 
If you actually look at the data in the report  take some population figure from wiki (and do some maths) and you'll see that if the SW is only getting 6% the north east is getting about 3.5%. And arguably HS2 will do as much for the NE as it will for the SW.

In all I'm not sure what this article is saying. The report is pretty much laying out HS2 is necessary, but will only work alongside other necessary works.  It seems that someone has cherry picked one bad graph used it to say the SW is neglected, and used to get get people to spit their dummy out.

My concern is that HS2 is being touted as the solution for the north, but does so little for so much of the north. In the report he does address this but almost exclusively in the M62 corridor, which is a good step but missed the point that that's pretty much the beginning of the North. 

The southwest probably suffers the same thing. We need to look beyond HS2. HS2 is necessary but isn't going to do much on it's own.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"The NHS is on the whole, pretty wonderful. (the stuff it gives out can be wonderful on the hole but that's a different story ;-))

When I was very young I had a lazy eye (still do, slightly), and dyspraxia. I got a free operation when I was three years old (or thereabouts) and regular appointments before and after to have the eye corrected, and regular appointments in the home and in school to have my dyspraxia worked on. All for free.

I now have a problem with my knees leading to it being easy for me to dislocate my kneecaps. The fist time this happened, in rural Herefordshire, a paramedic car turned up within 10 minutes with an ambulance 5 minutes later. They shot me full of morphine and gave me entonox, got me into a chair and through my parent's hard to get out of house, up a steep garden path and into the ambulance with little fuss. They made sure I was comfortable in the ambulance and when I got to A&amp;E a doctor relocated my kneecap whilst they were still wheeling me into a bay.

They got me into x-ray within half an hour and plastered me up within another 10 minutes, with an appointment to have the plaster removed and replaced with a removable cast 2 days later, where I also got physiotherapy appointments with the local ""cottage hospital"" - the small hospital in my home town that dealt with outpatient stuff, small procedures and local GPs etc. 

The next time it happened, a year later, this time in the showers of the gym where I was working out to strengthen the knee muscles (ironic, right? It gets better) the same crews turned up, did the same thing, I got seen quickly again and this time I was released pretty much straight away as it was a recurring issue they couldn't do much about.

Third time it happened was in Portsmouth, in January, when I paid a visit to the hospital for a routine appointment about what could be done in the long-term about the knee. I left the appointment, got 50 yards from the hospital, slipped on a patch of ice, and broke the knee again. This time it went back in whilst the ambulance crew were lifting me onto the stretcher, so I got put in minors for a few hours so I could rest in the warm before I called a taxi to take me home.

So, in short, the NHS have helped me become who I am today, I.E. someone who can walk without tripping over and dislocating bones (walking cured by dyspraxia treatment, bones not cured but patched up), and who can see properly.

How much did I or my parents pay directly? Nothing. Although our combined national insurance payments and other tax has assuredly paid for my care (plus extra by now!)

true,avro,null,null,"The UK's National Health Service (NHS) came into operation at midnight on the fourth of July 1948. It was the **first time anywhere in the world** that completely free healthcare was made available on the basis of citizenship rather than the payment of fees or insurance premiums. The service has cared for the nation for half a century and I suggest most Britons consider the NHS to have been an outstanding success.

Lets not forget that it additionally paved the way, inspired and pioneered the introduction of state healthcare systems **worldwide.**

It is difficult to overstate the domestic impact of the introduction of the National Health Service (NHS) on mortality. In the periods prior to introduction thousands died of infectious diseases like pneumonia, meningitis, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and polio. Although medical science was still at a basic stage, the NHS for the first time provided decent healthcare for all - and, at a stroke, transformed the lives of millions. **Whether banker or baker the service was for all.**

In purely medical terms the argument for success seems **overwhelming**. Men and women are living about 10-12 years longer on average than they did in 1948 - men to 76 and women to 81. 

The project is not without downsides. When the NHS was introduced in 1948, it sparked a huge surge of demand for medical care from people who had previously been denied access to free treatment. This demand has not abated and compounds the hospital 'waiting list' problem. On a typical day, approximately 700,000 people visit their GP, but family doctors often complain significant amounts of time is taken up by paperwork, and they do not have the resources to devote proper time to their patients.

Running costs, too, have soared in real terms. Each successive government administration has promised to solve the cash shortages that have plagued the NHS, but no politician has been able satisfactorily to match resources to demand and there have had to be cutbacks made in some areas.

Perhaps the final say should rest with patients themselves. Whatever the financial problems associated with the NHS, complaints about waiting times and the impact of privatization, polls regularly rate NHS preservation as the public's top political priority. According to YouGov polls nearly **three-quarters** (73%) consider the NHS to be one of the UK’s greatest achievements. 

IMHO I'm in the 73%.

**TLDR; The NHS is one of civilization's greatest achievements. Its faults and problems are far outweighed by its benefits.**

The most serious problem with the NHS is the funding of it, as a political hot potato this goes in swings and roundabouts. As such the levels of care vary, if you start taking doctors and nurses out of the system, it's going to struggle to fill the gaps. If they were able to find a way to remove political influence from the funding of the NHS then the problems would mostly resolve, this boom and bust makes it difficult to ideally target funding. 

The system can get crowded, quite often for good reason, people need treatment. A planned orthopaedic operation will often be re-scheduled because of a pile up on a nearby motorway. Understandable but frustrating to the patient waiting for a hip replacement. You can get real problems when this sort of thing happens, and the staffing levels have been cut through austerity measures. 

As a concept it is civilised, and very efficient due to it's huge bargaining power. Treatments of all kinds are cheaper. [Ridiculously enough, the government is devolving purchasing from a central system to local GP control, something GP's do not want as it takes time away from patients and it's not something they are trained or desire to do. Worse, it removes the purchasing power, putting individual GP's at risk of exploitation from drug cartels etc. and making the whole system vastly more expensive.] It isn't perfect, nothing is, but it works really well, and without the encroachment of government and private health ~~leeches~~ companies it is as good as you can get.

##Bills
 
* Great point about car insurance. I was much better off in terms of cashflow vs. capital when I started the policy (having just moved into London) but will look to pay yearly in full from now on.
* I spend £25 on fuel for personal use, but if I'm travelling for work then may easily drive 1000 miles in a week (but for this I can expense the mileage which is profitable). It's worth me having a car for all the out of town driving I do, even though this is intermittent. Plus, building up no claims bonus is valuable to me.
* Home insurance - agreed. Thanks again for that.
* My phone contract is up for renewal in six months or so. I will consider just keeping my current phone and going SIM only. Thanks.
* Food - I'm bad at this. I buy lunch out every day which can easily be £10. This will one of the areas I'll have to work on the hardest. A lot of the time when I'm working abroad I can expense my food which means that the £350 will be more like £100 for the month. Not always the case though.
* Credit card is with Amazon. I quite like having the vouchers as it means that a lot of my discretionary spending on ""things"" can be covered by this. Particularly if I'm abroad and expensing £4-6k through my card in a month!
 
##Savings
 
* The First Direct account sounds great, I'll look into that. 6% sounds very generous and I hear good things about their customer service.
* My emergency fund is in an instant-access ISA at the moment earning &lt;1% interest. Sounds like I may be able to get a better deal elsewhere.
* My pension is a SIPP which I am enrolled in by my company. Our employer contribution comes into effect in May. It's with HL and currently all just in their default fund. Not sure about costs but will look into it. I've only had the pension for two months so haven't got anything significant in there yet.
* Bitcoin I invested in a few years ago back at uni for 80p per BTC. Sold most at around £10 but held on to one coin. It's now worth roughly 400x that so I feel it's been worth it. I'd like to move that into something else now though as I feel the same way. I also had Premium Bonds but plan to move this into an investment account somewhere (possibly HL) once I understand my options.
 
##Goals
 
* You're the first person who's told me not to worry about a pension just yet. This has been stressing me, so it's good to hear a different opinion. I am just in the 40% tax band so moving that excess into my pension sounds like a wise move, depending on how employer matching will work once that starts.
* I shall be checking out your recommended reading.
 
Thanks again for all your advice, that's much appreciated. I’ve got a lot of work to do!

The NHS is the single biggest thing I'm proud of my country for (closely followed by the BBC).  There's a reason it was so heavily featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.      
    
It's one of the most efficient systems of healthcare in the world, it's cost-effective and has great outcomes (generally).  There will always be problems, after all 50% of staff and hospitals will always be ""below average"".    
    
I've had nothing but good experiences with my own healthcare and my family's; from a broken bone in my 1 year old to end of life care for grand-parents.  The very worst has been either personal interactions with some staff (some people will be intransigent jobsworths whether they're in public or private jobs); or more recently an 18 month wait to see a psychologist (it wasn't anything serious or urgent though so I'm not actually that fussed by this).    
    
The main issue is the politics of it.  The current government pledged in their manifesto and this was restated by our current PM that there would be ""no more top down reorganistions of the NHS"" - hitting a nerve as most problems in the NHS come from politicians thinking they're improving it, whereas constant tinkering just hacks everyone off and stops them getting on with looking after patients.  Pretty much the first NHS thing done was to instigate a new ""top-down reorganisation"" - exactly contradicting his pledge.  (Frankly this should disbar him from office on its own, let alone the other crap he's thrown at us.)    
    
My worry is that the NHS will fall to bits because that's what the politicians want.  Then they'll say ""look this system is not working, we're wasting money on it therefore we'll sell it to someone who can run it better"".  That someone will be the people that lobbied hardest and subsidised the Health Secretary (yes private health people gave money directly to the office of the Health Sec).  And, like the trains, we'll subsidize it and end up paying more for a worse service that pays the bosses huge bonuses.

I recently paid mine off (I'm much older than you!).  After lots of around the houses phone calls a couple of years ago, someone there actually told me what (or at least did) happens.

The process is that HMRC take the monthly payments off you (through your company's PAYE and other tax payments) and then keep them until they do their end of year (Apr - Mar) accounts.  Their end of year accounts happen between June and September and they will then pay the SLC the money that they owe them to pay off the loan.

That means that the SLC know very little about how much you've paid until they get it some several months after you've paid it.  When you've started paying, when you finish paying, etc.  If you think that you are going to finish paying off the loan, then you have to ring them up and prove it by sending them your pay slips with the amount you've paid on it.  They will then contact HMRC and ask them to stop taking it from your pay (by changing your tax code).

Mine was screwed because my last payment was due in April or May and so they wouldn't have known I'd paid it off until the following August and would have continued taking it out of my pay packet.  As it was it took so long that I did overpay and I finally got a rebate for what I'd overpaid some 18 months later (partly due to my incompetence of moving house and not telling them the new address).",0,1395137598,null,0,false,0,cg5ibr9,t3_20phfo,t1_cg5ibr9,t3_20phfo,null,1432957830,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

The care is usually great and the doctors and nurses are mostly brilliant. There have been many occasions I've been thankful for the NHS, and will continue to be.


However, it depends on what area of the NHS. The hospital care is mostly brilliant (unless you live in certain parts of the country where the hospital trusts are under investigation), but the GP practices around here suck. You have to wait at minimum two weeks for an appointment, and if it's something that needs to be seen that day the you need to wait to see the emergency Dr... but at the *non-medically trained* receptionist's discretion. 

I went to the emergency Dr on the advice of a neuro-consultant to get my MRI results. I was told by the receptionist that it wasn't important so I had to wait about 9 days for an appointment. At this point I'd had crippling headaches for 2 weeks and I was obviously worried something was severely wrong. I had to have her call my consultant so she would let me see a Dr. That was largely pointless as he read my results in medical terms and asked how I wanted him to help me. If I knew how to treat the fucking headaches, I wouldn't be seeing the Dr.

That very same Dr also told my Nana, when she had developed a serious infection in her lungs, that she was too old and he couldn't/wouldn't treat her. That infection became pneumonia and she died a month ago. That bastard then had the gall to send us a letter saying he was sorry to hear about her death and if we needed any help coping, to call him. Like we'd do that.

The private sector is very good at eliminating waste, at driving down marginal costs and operating on smaller margins than the public sector has. Unfortunately the private sector is not as good at strategic planning orcontingent capability. The 'what if' UK energy supply falls and demand increases? 'What if' energy prices globally increase?

Because of this, the private sector does not really invest at the same pace as the public sector. This meant we had a *constricted* supply - we would only supply where it was profitable, rather than where it was needed - or even just as insurance. There is no strategic vision. 

Whilst a single public NHS with vision may well fund inoculations and vaccinations free for all children because they know it will save money (and health) in the future, a privately run hospital would never do so. I guess that's a tragedy of the commons issue?

Then again, the whole flipside of my argument is that if the public sector sells all its assets and stops investing, its a big saving for the treasury. What they do with that windfall I don't know.

He has various other health problems and complications that sometimes arise due to this - in America I'm pretty sure it would be nigh-on impossible to get insurance that would wholly pay for any and all complications that could arise from this, since it would likely get classed as a ""pre-existing condition"".

Over here, no such problems. He has (I believe) 6-monthly eye tests, various other blood tests and such regularly, all of his insulin and slood sugar monitors paid for on the NHS and he's able to live a normal, *worry free* life.

I could have an opportunity to work in the US on a much more regular basis soon and quite frankly one of the two main issues that would stop me from doing so is the way healthcare ""works"" out there.

I've heard a saying that the US has the best healthcare in the world... the problem is that only about half the population actually has access to it and can afford it.

Thankfully nothing was wrong, and I came through the process costing me merely the petrol to get to hospital, and the time it takes me to jizz into a sterile container.

You have to remember that when everything goes perfect, it's rarely shouted from the rooftops. It's not on newspapers and TV when something is done well. It only gets talked about when fuck ups happen, and this might seem frequent, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not that many.

Some parts are inefficient, some parts are overworked and understaffed. But for the vast majority, it is fantastic. Pay per use for certain public services is a terrible idea, and I'm surprised there are democratic countries out there that stand for it when there are better options available.

The NHS provides an excellent service and if you occasionally have to wait a bit, you don't actually have to wait that long and it's not worth my while to pay a large sum of money to get it a little bit faster. When I was tested and fitted with my hearing aid, I could have gone private, but it would only have saved about a month. I've already been coping for several years with deteriorating hearing, so what's another month? It's certainly not worth the thousand quid a private appointment and aid would have been.

But it's also not worth it for health reasons. If you're having surgery, then you want to have it in an NHS hospital, because if anything goes wrong in a private hospital and you need care that they don't provide (most private hospitals can't cope with serious infections, or intensive care, for example) then you'll just get put in an ambulance to an NHS hospital anyway, so you're better off having started there in the first place.

Finally, lots of employers, including my current one, offer medical insurance as a perk. This isn't like US medical insurance, it's just meant as a top-up on top of the NHS. It's treated as a benefit-in-kind and taxable. The tax hit is of the order of a few tens of pounds. And despite it being so incredibly cheap, I've decided that it ain't worth it.

1. We weren't ""mediocre"" last season, more ""inconsistent"" - last season was our worst start in decades, but even then there were signs of what Rodgers was trying to do. There were a LOT of defensive/midfield mistakes that resulted from players struggling to adjust to a new system, but when it clicked, we scored a lot of goals. 

2. Related to that, I'd say that while there have been improvements in our performances, our biggest gains have been mental/psychological. I think this is a combination of the confidence Rodgers instils in his players, improved results, and greater confidence in the tactical system. Players this season seem to know exactly what is expected of them, but also of what everyone else will be doing, and where they will be. In terms of personnel, our team looks very similar to last season, but it's our mental fortitude that has been one of our most impressive features this time around.

3. Rodgers has learned from his mistakes, and adjusted accordingly.

In theory competitiveness in a market means that companies will vie to price in a way that will get more customers and will thus innovate in ways that the public sector won't be able to.

In practice a huge percentage of the cost of energy is from wholesale and most companies pay the same price.  And they can't innovate in service, because the service they offer is the same - they provide energy.

What would have been better is if they had privatised in a sensible way:  The price you pay for energy is the same no matter which provider you have and you pay to a nationalised service who can get economies of scale (which they do anyway in the current model).

The only bad thing is that GP coverage right now isn't good enough, and so a lot of things that GPs could take care of end up in the Accident &amp; Emergency departments after 5pm, so if you're unlucky enough to end up with something that just needs stitching up then you're in for a wait.  I put a pretty deep cut into my forearm at work, a few years back, and it took three-and-a-half hours to get seen.  On the other hand, three weeks ago my mate busted his head on a bowling ball (arsing around at the alley) and he was seen, stitched, and discharged in about an hour.

I think this issue is going to be resolved soon.  It stems from the BMA (British Medical Association), which is the doctor's trade union, managing to negotiate one hell of a deal with the last government, which resulted in GPs being paid three times as much as GPs in Europe but for a lot less work: they open 9-5 and don't have to do housecalls.  This means that they often can't take appointments in advance or they'd be booked up for weeks.  In a lot of cases this means that if you want to see a doctor and it's, say, Monday, you can't make an appointment for Friday - you have to ring up Monday morning at 0830 and see if they can see you the same day.  If not, you ring up Tuesday morning at 0830 and see if they can see you the same day.  And so on and so forth until you get an appointment.

The fact that I can break both my legs and get it sorted without having to worry about being able to afford it is brilliant.

""... I opened my copy of the Spectator only to read a blistering attack by Times journalist Michael Gove on the 2001 intake of Tory MPs. According to this otherwise unimpeachable Conservative-inclined commentator, my fellow new MPs and I are ""complacent"" with our lot, ""in retreat from the modern world"", and deluded by ""the easy charm of home counties cocktail parties"" and ""the clubbish camaraderie of the house"".

Most infuriating of all, he claimed we only speak about ""hunting, Gibraltar and spin,"" subjects that ""find a warm response among those who are still listening in South Barsetshire.""

Nevermind the brass neck of all this coming from a comfortably upholstered commentator, who has the luxury of a weekly column putting the world to rights without having to worry about voters, surgeries, elections, whips, parliamentary procedure and all the rest of it: I'll come on to that later. The fact is that he is plain wrong.

I admit that the class of 2001 has made reference to some standard Tory topics like defence, the rights of people in Gibraltar and hunting. What's wrong with that? If it hadn't been for new MPs, like Pat Mercer (Newark), Hugo Swire (East Devon) and Hugh Robertson (Mid Kent), who actually served in the armed forces, the debates about Afghanistan and Iraq would have been a lot less well informed.

As for Gibraltar, Andrew Rosindell (Romford) should be applauded rather than criticised for making sure that the government had to debate their planned betrayal of loyal British subjects on the floor of the Commons. Hunting may be a minority pursuit, but the presence of 400,000 people on the streets of London for the countryside march demonstrated that it has a resonance far beyond South Barsetshire.

But if Michael Gove spent some time in the Commons - or better still made his newspaper report some of its proceedings - he would have noticed that the new intake has devoted much more time to the staple subjects of transport, local government, housing, education and health.

Whether it is Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight) talking about his hands-on experience in education or Andrew Selous (South West Bedfordshire) talking about his work with the homeless, the tone has been positive and predominantly focused on the public services.

For my own part, I have spoken on health, transport, social services, civil liberties and helped author a radical select committee report on drugs. And, as well as saying and writing these things, we have to defend them in front of often sceptical constituency parties.

Are we complacent? Hell no. None of us is content with our lot. Opposition is frustrating, even after a few months. Of course there is a buzz about arriving in the ""mother of parliaments"" and discovering the comfort of the smoking room and the gossip of the tea room. But these things soon wear off.

In any event, it is not as if having the magic initials MP after your name is seen by others as being a badge of honour. I happen to think that it is an incredibly worthwhile job, but all of us know that in the era of the Clark, Currie and Archer diaries, Tory MPs are suspected by some of being cads, sex maniacs or crooks - or a combination of all three.

But, Michael, if you are still unhappy with our performance you can do something that I have been pressing on you for years. Give up the journalist's expense account and cast aside ambitions of editing the Thunderer. Gird up your loins and prepare for late nights sitting on uncomfortable green benches.

Instead of dashing off 700 words at your PC that will flow effortlessly into the op-ed page of the Times, you may have to wait seven hours to make a 10-minute speech that few newspapers will ever report.

More simply, he never rotated the squad, meaning that for the last third of the season they were visibly exhausted, and the overlooked squad players were rusty as hell. Redknapp knew playing his best players constantly would have made him look good by then and he could deflect blame onto the players (remember the interview about ""dunno what all this is about exhaustion, I never had a player come and tell me he's too tired to play"", making it seem like it's the players' fault?). The fact is that top-level football wears out even the most athletic player over the course of a season.

That said, he wasn't the useless hack he's sometimes made out to be. Unlike AVB and, seemingly, Sherwood, he realised Spurs' squad suited a deep defence (Dawson, Gallas, BAE) and quick counterattacks (Lennon, Bale, Defoe) and had the tactical nous to play Modric deep rather than behind the striker, so he could launch those attacks quickly.

It'll take a man who knows how to manage a big club with a lot of pressure on his shoulders, who has the force of personality to deal with bad apples and push everyone to their limits (and I don't mean just calling out the players in the press... I mean someone who is equal parts tactful, cunning and fearsome), and someone who is tactically sophisticated.  You can see why LVG's been viewed as a good candidate... he's not a coach with ""potential"" like the names you mentioned.  He's actually someone who's won stuff at huge clubs.

I do agree that he's not some magic silver bullet to solve all our problems.  That will take time, planning and expenditure most likely beyond what we've already invested.  But what I like about him as a candidate is that he's bullish enough to stand up to Levy and Baldini if necessary, he knows how big clubs with good academies are run, and he's not shy of the hot seat.  He is also not afraid to use youth, and has a good eye for talent.

It would be terrific to unearth someone in the mould of Martinez or Rodgers - progressive, young managers who could begin a small dynasty with us.

The good thing about this is your insurance will protect you from bigger losses if they have say breached the terms of their insurance.

Redknapp was far from perfect but the football was scintillating and he got the best out of his players. Crucially he insisted on signing his own players so he could mould a team.

Levy nearly got us relegated after putting Comolli in charge of transfers and Ramos in charge of the team. After Redknapp rescued things he was dumped and we have a return to the disastrous strategy of a director of football signing players (this time Baldini) and a coach trying a failing to create a team. AVB, like Ramos, took the blame when things inevitably went wrong, but the problem is Levy. He wants to be the most powerful person at the club so he splits the duties of coaching and signing players, even though it's painfully obvious that it doesn't work.

It's worth remembering that Redknapp was the last person Levy wanted at the club. He was brought in out of desperation with Spurs rock bottom of the league and facing relegation to the Championship. Redknapp was only given the green light to build his own exciting, attacking team because he wouldn't take the job otherwise.

Its usually easier to do it through the insurance company and certainly if you have legal cover you can probably try and sue them for breach of contract or something but it all depends on the terms of the insurance etc.

As for it putting up your renewal, they can do that even though it was not your fault in anyway. but they cant mark it down as your fault and justify it that way as it wasnt and they know that.

I think that Vlaar, Clark, and Baker are all way better than they were last year and Clark and Baker are going to keep improving and will be better even by next year.  Those two have a lot of potential and Okore has even more, so I'm  comfortable with what we have for center backs.  We do, however, need a LB.  I do like Luna and Bennet however neither one is ready to be our starting LB.  We need someone like Bertrand to calm our defense down.  When Bertrand plays it is obvious how much better our young CBs and Delph are able to play.   They can concentrate on their own areas more and it takes away a gaping hole.  We need to either buy Bertrand or find someone similar.

I also feel like the CM you are talking about is Westwood. You described him to a t.   It wouldn't hurt to have someone with a little muscle in the midfield.  Someone like we all were hoping Sylla would be. However I think the priority should be a playmaking central midfielder.   Someone who can work with Delph to open up other teams.  That should be our priority and where we spend the majority of our money.  Someone like Holtby would be perfect in my opinion.

I also think it would help to have a real left midfielder.  I think if we had an Albrighton like player on the left then Lambert would have been able to play a 4-4-2 with Albrighton on the right a lot more often this season.  Someone like Grealish would be perfect but I doubt he'll be ready for that.

A huge focus needs to be on retaining players.  Re-signing Albrighton and Gardner.  Holding on to players like Benteke and Delph.  I also hope that Lambert has backup plans in case we lose some of those players (he better have an amazing striker in his sights just in case!). 

TL;DR: We need a solid LB (Bertrand like), a playmaking midfielder (Holtby like), and a solid left midfielder for when we want to change tactics to a 4-4-2.

Problem being, Moyes isn't  fantastic coach (honestly, not that he is bad, he's just an average manager) and United's squad has some major issues that SAF was able to essentially cover up with his ability. Now United are in a spot where they have to make a really hard choice.

As an employer, I'd agree with you, it totally is, it's what I'd hope anyone who works for me would do.  Hell if they where really needed those days, I'm sure we could find a solution.

However, the problem is you've not suffered a loss.  Our legal system is based on compensation for losses.

&gt; The third party has accepted liability. So why don't I have a lower premium and then IF they fail to pay, they then charge me more?

Because that would cost more money.  They are effectively covering you until that happens.  What your in effect asking for is a free loan for the liability that something might go wrong.

&gt; If their insurance is invalidated, 

I know :( I am just trying to explain some of these problems, and why they are there.  The world is not a perfect place, these procedures and systems are not fun.  One of the reasons they do this is that invalidated insurance is legally a different thing to un-insured, IANAL but I think it's civil rather than criminal (can someone who knows more clarify?).

&gt; But it was a crime.

Your hurt, I get that, I was knocked off my bicycle once by some cunt who didn't even stop, I hit the curve hard enough to break my helmet and a light on my bike.  I would have happily in that moment killed the guy.  Luckily they don't let victims decide these things.

The issue is that in getting some compensation from the other party is a long and complex process, it's a civil matter and frankly the cost to the tax payer would be immense.  In your case it sounds like there is little beyond the value of your car that you would be awarded.  So letting your insurance company do that is the best bet for you.  If those days you missed were billed at say £1k each, you probably wouldn't make any profit on going to court for it, as it could be argued that you should have simply taken a taxi or hired a car etc.

Instead I choose to donate a large portion of it to charity, and do volunteer work in my spare time. Why? Because although it's nice to have lots of money it's not a *necessity*, there are people who need it far more than I do, and the system is geared towards keeping money in the hands of people who have lots of it, and giving as little as possible to people who really need it.

Just think of the good work that you could do for people who need help with the amount of money it would take to buy a luxury yacht. They're invariably the same people who made it possible to own your big luxury yacht.

Nobody *deserves* to have a luxury yacht. If you like to play with boats that's fine, get a boat, but you don't need a luxury yacht. If you have worked hard in life congratulations, hopefully you've put enough by to have a comfortable retirement. You still don't need a luxury yacht.

I am a fan of what Levy has done with the club. I remember when Christian Gross was in charge and we were facing relegation, so I have to accept the progress we've made. For me, the one weakness with Daniel Levy is that he's very bad at choosing managers. (Either that or he's good at choosing managers but very bad at backing them when the team isn't playing well). I really wish that Levy and Redknapp had stuck together because I think they made a good team. If you leave Levy to his own devices he will buy young players based mostly on their resale value, and if you leave Redknapp to his own devices he'll buy a load of 35-year-olds on massive wages because he's managed them before and they can walk straight into the first team.

The whole ""waiting line"" thing is the biggest complaint. Reality is, that if you're in serious need of urgent care, you skip the queue and so you should. If you have a minor problem or something that can wait, then aren't you lucky.

You actually find if anything that most people don't visit the doctor that often. My friends in the US actually seem to go to the doctor more for stuff my docs would tell me to go home and rest for, and in my opinion it's because you guys have grown up in a culture where medicine is a product that is being sold. If doctors are going to make more money from prescribing you something you don't absolutely need, they will. In the UK, it's the opposite, and you don't get a prescription unless it's really necessary.

For example, I have a fungal nail infection and my doc basically told me to learn to manage it, because the treatment to rid it completely is long and expensive and has side effects. I guarantee in the US I'd have been put on that course of treatment.

And my American friends go to the docs with a sore throat and get prescribed meds - my doc would never do that. I'd be told to go home and drink honey and lemon. And as such, we're a nation of people who don't bother going to the docs unless we're dying.

If the US switched to a system like ours, it would take years for this cultural shift to happen and it would be a costly and problematic system for a while, BECAUSE of the different mentalities.

People in the UK are quite skeptical of the dentist because of the NHS. We have to pay for dental treatment (subsidised) so anything they suggest is immediately given a skeptical eye of ""are they trying to get money from me"". I hadn't been for 10 years, when I finally go they clean my teeth and since then my teeth ache.

true,Deepfried_Goods,num11,,"This is absolutely incorrect. If you look at the season in which AZ won, just by looking at the league table it is evident that a great deal of the club's success that season was due to the poor performances of their rivals with literally every other team around them underperforming with AZ being the only team to go beyond 70 points that season. What player from AZ now plays for us? Do you mean Chadli? he played for Twente and didnt even arrive for another 2 seasons. Actually AZ had El Hamdaoui who outscored Suarez that season. Sounds like a star player in that team.

Admittedly that is an obvious flaw in my praise of Yakin that Basel are the best team in the Swiss league. But I am looking beyond league performances, which remain impressive, especially in his first season where after taking the reigns turned around an 11 point deficit to win the league. But judging by his team's European performances. The results in addition to performances would suggest that he is doing extremely well with the resources at his disposal. The fact that Basel could get to the Europa league semi final last season after overcoming teams like Dnipro, Zenit and us not to mention outplaying us at The Lane is hugely impressive. In addition to besting Chelsea twice and only being undone by poor officiating in this season's CL would suggest that Yakin does have that special something

Edit: re-reading and it seems I came off a bit more confrontational than I had intended to. Also as pointed out it was Moussa at AZ.

&gt; 
&gt; Playing in a dangerous manner is defined as any action that, while
&gt; trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player himself). It is committed with an opponent nearby and prevents the opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.
&gt; 
&gt; A scissors or bicycle kick is permissible provided that, in the opinion of the referee, it is not dangerous to an opponent.
&gt; 
&gt; Playing in a dangerous manner involves no physical contact between the players. If there is physical contact, the action becomes an offence punishable with a direct free kick or penalty kick. In the case of physical contact, the referee should carefully consider the high probability that misconduct has also
&gt; been committed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Disciplinary sanctions**
&gt; 
&gt; • If a player plays in a dangerous manner in a “normal” challenge, the
&gt; referee should not take any disciplinary action. If the action is made with obvious risk of injury, the referee should caution the player
&gt; 
&gt; • If a player denies an obvious goalscoring opportunity by playing in a
&gt; dangerous manner, the referee should send off the player

Meh, I don't really feel that strongly about this. If the ref deemed that elbow in front to be dangerous, it's a caution. The only issue is whether or not he saw it.

I was hit by an uninsured driver, being chased by the police, through a red light. I was stationary at the time. Unfortunately my little banger Nova was only covered 3rd party, F&amp;T. Had to wait months for the crown prosecutions to go through first, then my legal cover went in and sued him. Got awarded enough to pay for the repairs (that I'd paid out of pocket)... but the guy moved with no forwarding address, so the bailiffs gave it up as unrecoverable. Seems a bit wank that he can just move and never pay me. He was a known bad boy to the police, and maybe he's gone clean, but i wonder if he's been brought in again, and if so why the police can't say hold on this guy has an outstanding civil fine. And of course even though it's a no fault to me, it's still an accident so up go my premiums.

My brothers parked car get hit one night by a drunk driver. Eyewitness pointed out his house. Called police took him in he confessed to drunk driving (good job he did apparently as if he didn't the police said they might not be able to nail him for it as it took them time to get there). He had two cars, one nice, insured, the other a banger uninsured. Banger was teh one that hit him. Had matching damage marks. He tried all sorts of flim flam, ""it was the other car"" ""it was my tenant"" ""I don't live here"" (he apparently had two addresses). I think eventually it was sorted but because the cunt wouldn't co-operate it took well over a year. In the mean time while it was going on the insurance company would basically freeze my brothers no claims, but only if he renewed with them.

Sure, once in a while you will be driving along an empty motorway and there will be some arsehole doing 65 in the middle lane with no other vehicles in sight. Mildly annoying, but it doesn't really matter.

But usually on a busy motorway, the slow lane is full of lorries, and the middle lane is full of normal drivers getting annoyed because the car in front is going slightly slower than they would ideally like to. The fast lane is full of aggressive speeders.

For those in the middle lane, there is no point pulling over into the slow lane because they would need to pull back out again 3 seconds later. There is no point trying to overtake the car in front because they would have someone driving up 6 inches behind them flashing their lights - and all they would gain is to get one car ahead, still doing the same speed. So everyone sits there.

Sometimes you even get a situation where the slow lane is full of lorries, the fast lane is full of cars, and the middle lane is virtually empty. But who do you blame for that? Which particular driver gets a fine and points? Everyone is doing the same thing.

I think typically motorway congestion is down to too much traffic. I don't think there is some small, identifiable group of lane hogs who are causing all the problems.",0,1395145491,null,0,false,0,cg5jrnm,t3_20pgzn,t1_cg5jrnm,t1_cg5ita1,null,1432958576,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

In long, by all reports Rodgers is an incredible man-manager. Players like Suarez, Sturridge, Sterling, Henderson, Skrtel all started the season with questions over their talent or personalities. Rodgers has galvanised his squad and led by professional example every time he opens his mouth whether it be press conference or interview. 
Another great trait of Rodgers is his ability to review his own work and learn from mistakes. Games against Arsenal, Southampton and Utd are good examples. 


Credit has to be given to the owners Fenway Sports Group who learnt very early with big money on Carroll, Henderson and Downing but have backed BR with a very clear brief and hand picked Rodgers as well which is also important.

&gt;

&gt;___The Bards of Wales___ ([Hungarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language): *A walesi bárdok*) is a [ballad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad) by [Hungarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians) poet [János Arany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Arany), written in 1857. Alongside the [Toldi trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toldi_trilogy) it is one of his most important works.

&gt;Arany was asked to write a poem of praise for the visit of [Franz Joseph I of Austria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria), as were other Hungarian poets. Arany instead wrote about the tale of the 500 [Welsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) [bards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard) sent to the stake by [Edward I of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England) for failing to sing his praises at a banquet in [Montgomery Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Castle). The poem was intended as a metaphor to criticise the [Habsburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg) rule over [Hungary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary) after the [Hungarian Revolution of 1848](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848). It was a method of [passive resistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_Resistance_(Hungary\)) to the repressive politics of [Alexander von Bach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Alexander_von_Bach) in Hungary, and the planned visit of the monarch.  

&gt;The poem was written ""for the desk drawer"" and was first published 6 years later in 1863, disguised as a translation of an [Old English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English) ballad, order to evade censorship.

Bristol is indeed a vibrant city, probably one of the most happening cities in the UK at present. The girl and I have seriously considered moving there ourselves lately. I have music business in Bristol and she has friends there and now hates what London has become. You've got tons of kids who ride skateboards and scooters and the place is buzzing with activity in the summer, there's a real vibe about it. Great music scene too. One of the reasons I'd like to live there and something I feel is being kicked out of London as it's become gentrified by money.  

It's not antisocial and nuisance behaviour, it's just kids having fun. And as for kicking a ball about in a park and people socially gathering in a park around a disposable BBQ on a summers day. I mean. Really?

But oh no, let's put an end to it and suck the life out of the city.

---

&gt;Alonso was born into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, [Periko Alonso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_%C3%81ngel_Alonso), won [La Liga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga) twice in successive seasons with [Real Sociedad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Sociedad) and a third time after he moved to [FC Barcelona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona). He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career.  Xabi Alonso was born in the small town of [Tolosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolosa,_Spain), [Gipuzkoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gipuzkoa), [Basque Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community\)). Alonso lived in [Barcelona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona) for the first six years of his life and moved to [Donostia (San Sebastián)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n,_Puerto_Rico) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at *Playa de la Concha* (Shell Beach).  On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, [Mikel Arteta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta), and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability.  He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, [Mikel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Alonso), to [CE Sabadell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_Sabadell_FC)'s training ground to practise together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal.  At an early age, he decided to play as a [defensive midfielder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_midfielder), a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well. This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.

From wiki's page on [British Nationality Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law):

""Under the law in effect from 1 January 1983, a child born in the UK to a parent who is a British citizen or 'settled' in the UK is automatically a British citizen by birth.""

If you're born in the United Kingdom to parents settled within the UK, you're a British citizen under UK law. Which means you're British. It's got nothing to do with ""British Isles"" or ""Great Britain"" or anything. To go more extreme you can also been born in Gibraltar or the Falklands and still be considered British as they're British Overseas Territories, even though they're clearly not within Great Britain or the British Isles. The term ""British"" essentially means ""UK citizen"" not ""person native to the island of Great Britain"". Which is confusing, but how things are. 

Under UK law anyone born in Northern Ireland automatically has British citizenship - pretty much the only exception is if they're born to a set of Irish parents (or other non-British parents) who haven't lived there long enough to be considered ""settled"" in NI. They're also typically entitled to Irish citizenship too under the Good Friday agreement, unless the reverse set of criteria is true (both parents are British). Which passport they choose to have is kind of irrelevant as they'll hold dual citizenship either way and can still be considered to have British citizenship. The only exception is if you pay the admin fee to explicitly revoke your citizenship as a British national.

Probably using the road in the same way the other three lanes are being used at the same moment - when the weight of traffic is that great, it's a bit silly to start complaining about one of the lanes being 'for overtaking only' - that advice is from a bygone age when there were 20% of the cars on the road that there are today, and we didn't have an M25.

You have an open total lose claim. You need to renew during the period you have an open claim.

You do not loose no claims if not your fault. Even if a total lose as its your first claim you will not lose all your NCD. You will lose 2 or 3 years max first time round.

You simply need to shop around for a policy and declare you have a no fault total lose. You will pay a touch more as even though not your fault you are now a higher probability of risk and must accept the premium. After all you are the one that left the car in that place. If it was in another spot you would not be here today.

Edit - Now the other person has accepted the responsibility / You provide crime ref to insurance comp you should be getting payment soon. Soon as the cash comes your insurance comp will update the no claims info and claim payout info then should reflect the correct situation.  Its not instant but pretty quick nowadays. I got a total lose payout in 6 days from date of crash.

I was on my 3rd year, so I have lost my 2 years 10 months basically, I would have been on 3 years at the time of renewal, but now I'm on 0.

I am renewing during the dispute yes, but I *have* lost all my no claims because while in dispute it is classed as *my* fault, not a *no* fault.

I can't shop around putting a ""no fault total loss"" because during the dispute it is a ""my fault total loss"". I can't legally say its ""no fault"" because Hastings has put it on my record as *my* fault.

So my insurance has gone up dramatically during the dispute and all I have is vague assurances that I will get a refund when its resolved, but no guarantee on how much.

The argument of ""after all you left it in that place"" is meaningless when regardless of what address I put in, adding a claim increases it the same. The claim has no address associated with it. If I moved house, same situation. If i parked it in a different location, same situation. (Lets ignore the fact I pay them insurance to park it there). Someone else living on my street, unaffected. If it was the address, the street should have the claim on it too.

You honestly don't see **anything** wrong here? If I told you right now, this second, a drunk driver could write off your car and you have to pay more for 5 years, you're ok with that? If I told you whatever you paid this year for insurance, you now need to pay nearly double to renew, you're ok with that?

EDIT - And further, its on *my* record as *my* fault even though Hastings has confirmed over the phone that the third party has accepted full liabilty.

For instance a government ""creating"" money for social programs would devalue the currency and increase inflation under either system. 

*Edit because I've now read the BoE paper he links, he has seriously misunderstood the scope of the paper and cherry picked quotes to come to conclusions which it does not. In fact its main point is,

normal times, these reserves cannot be multiplied into more
loans and deposits and how these reserves do not represent
‘free money’ for banks.

The 2 articles together are actually very good explanations of how everything works and don't require any real economic knowledge, well worth a read.

Somebody crashed into my Father in law's car whilst it was parked, at around 8pm at night. They weren't drunk, but they were doing ~50mph in a residential area, writing off our car and rolled their van onto it's side.

Now we thought the insurance would be fairly clear cut; the car was parked. But no, the victim denied liability for crashing into our parked car. It was a nightmare that went on for months as the insurance company dragged their feet for so long. At which point we just rang the company who owned the van and threatened to sue. They admitted liability soon after that and then the insurance was able to properly process the claim (But only after we intervened).

The insurance company did jack shit for the money we pay them. The premiums are not just for paying out, it's also for taking up the hassle of processing our claims, which they flat out did not do.

* Pay off my mortgage (£30,000 or so).
* Buy a new house, happily I've got a few local ones bookmarked, so I know where I'd pick already.
* Stick most of the remaining money in index-funds to give me an income.
* Buy £1 million pounds worth of flats, here in Edinburgh, and setup a property-management company to manage them.

Having no mortgage my expenses would be restricted to bills and travel / fun-money.  So the income from rental would easily cover that.  If things got tight or I started to get greedy I could pull 2-4% from the index funds if required.

That is my rough plan for £2-5 million, I guess with an order of magnitude more I'd just buy more rental properties, or try something truely ambitious such as building a couple of blocks of ""perfect"" student flats.  Easy to clean, identical, and price them nice and cheap with the caveat that you had to get good grades to qualify, or similar.  I remember the pain of student rentals so doing something like that which would earn a return, but also be ""nice"" might be a plan.

Yes. The relevant law, RIPA, does not prohibit individuals from recording their own communications provided that the recording is for their own use. Recording or monitoring are only prohibited where some of the contents of the communication - which can be a phone conversation or an e-mail - are made available to a third party, ie someone who was neither the caller or sender nor the intended recipient of the original communication. For further information see the Home Office website where RIPA is posted

No, provided you are not intending to make the contents of the communication available to a third party. If you are you will need the consent of the person you are recording.

I've seen most of his stuff which is readily available to someone in the US, and every character he plays is *completely and utterly different*.

In *The Hour*, he is a reserved and somewhat enigmatic news editor with barely-controlled OCD, haunted by the loss of a daughter he had never known.

In *The Thick of It*, he is a foul-mouthed, manipulative bastard who also happens the be the smartest guy in the room at any given moment.

In *Hotel!*, he is a slimy, utterly unlikeable hotel manager (notably playing opposite Paul McGann, would you believe!).

In *Torchwood: Children of Earth*, he is a nice man who made an expedient but terribly immoral decision decades earlier, the repercussions of which gradually pull him into a downward spiral toward the most horrible situation imaginable.

In *Doctor Who*, he is a regular bloke (albeit one in ancient Pompeii), slightly bumbling and comedic, but eminently likable.

In *The Musketeers* he is the ruthless power behind the throne, who thinks nothing of having a mistress executed when she becomes unreliable, but is unable to resist a goodbye wave and a twinkling smile at the King's young nephew as he leaves after a visit.

And so forth.

As the Doctor, he has the potential to be funny, fierce, vulnerable, crotchety, young, ancient, sad, angry, and a million other things. I think it is that endless potential that excites those of us who have seen Capaldi in other things.

I agree that the club needs stability but to expect stability from management in today's football is unfortunately not something that happens all that often. Wenger and SAF are complete outliers in this regard, look how often even the biggest teams change management. If you can get 2-3 good seasons out of a manager it is actually pretty average.

The thing with LvG is that whether you think he has been helped by the talent at the clubs or not the man preaches a true philosophy and strives to have it implemented from top to bottom. This more than anything else is what we need, if we could get LvG to come in and lay the philosophical groundwork for the future (as well as manage the team on the pitch) it would allow us to narrow our search for a new manager when LvG leaves (and obviously he will leave after say 3 seasons) quickly and identify the type of player who would fit the club and the style we play rather than selecting players as if we were playing football manager.

I like Tim but i don't think the timing is right for him to be our manager there just isn't anything about him that makes me think he could be anything other than average young manager learning his craft.

I pointed out in other posts on here that for our success in the past 5 years we are actually just as close to Everton's performance as we are any of the top 4 teams.

Consider this since the 00/01 season our average finishing position has been 8th, Everton's has been 9th. In that time period both of us have been the CL 1 time.  In the past 5 seasons we have actually been on an uptrend with an average finishing position of 5th, Everton has as well with an average finishing position of 7th..the average difference in points between us in the past 5 seasons....5 points. Not exactly a gulf of difference from a ""CL contender"" to a ""mid-table contender"". 

Keep in mind that during the same time period from 00/01 LFC was averaging a finishing position of 5th with a CL title, a CL runner up and an appearance in the CL semis.  In the past 4 season LFC had an average finishing position of 7th, prior to that they had averaged 4th and had 2 2nd place finishes in the league and 2 FA Cup wins.

We have done very well and we have been in many ways unfortunate that City have come in and blown everyone away by building a monster of a team, but we also have been fortunate in the past few seasons that LFC were in a down period and this season that United are down.

Limiting unskilled European immigration cuts the need for housing, domestic energy consumption, petrol consumption (nearly everything is transported via lorries)... Meaning the prices of all these fall, which helps the working class.

That's a strange point to start with. Can you post a link showing that unskilled European immigration is an issue? You sound like those idiots that warned of a Romanian invasion that never turned up.

Leaving the EU saves us 50million a day, which can then be spent on the working class/wherever the fuck we like. They'll still want to sell things here so trade won't suffer. If the Spanish also don't want our pensioners who have life savings to spend and are in effect 'cash cows' that wont be competing on the job market, all the better for us!

Could you be a bit more naive? You have no comprehension of how trade works. Increased tariffs (by not being part of the FREE trade zone) would cause trade to suffer greatly.

UKip want grammar schools to be reinstated. This will help children progress in education on the merit of ability, not money behind them. Creating greater equality in education.

I'm not going to get into a debate about grammer schools, there is not enough evidence either way.

UKip think government should keep its nose out where its not wanted. No more pictures of dead babies on ciggy packets, and let pubs decide if ppl can smoke in them. Also, let people vape if they want. 

The sad thing is you probably think that's true. The UKIP can say anything they like as they will never be in power. But regardless of that fact, allowing me to vape doesn't make them pro working class. It makes them pro-vape. Also pics of dead babies on fag packs? 1) Do you seriously give a fuck?  2) Again how the fuck is this pro working class? Large numbers of working class people being smokers is not a answer.

If it was a Poe then well done for parroting exactly the sort of inane bullshit I was referring to.

My boss is a part time A &amp; E doctor and says every day, it is abused by people with coughs, colds, headache, small bumps and bruises *simply* because they couldn't get a doctors appointment.

My own experiences of the NHS have been mixed. I've come across doctors who couldn't care, shocking nurses at my local hospital, but then lovely HCA's and some down-right amazing consultants.

The system is like the others. You have good and bad points, but this is not indicative of the NHS, it is not a fault of the NHS. You'll have this issue in the US - you might have a headache and go to the doctor and they might simply not care one bit.",0,1395160447,null,0,false,0,cg5pdsk,t3_20oz92,t1_cg5pdsk,t3_20oz92,null,1432961222,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

I just feel that it's a really poor exposure to the world of 'serious' finance. The student loan is probably the second most significant debt that I'll have in my lifetime - other than a mortgage at some point in the future - and it's handled so ineptly.

It could be argued that thhis government's major platform has been fiscal responsibility, and yet one of the key individual/government debt interactions is overwhelmingly shit. I know it's a legacy solution, but still.

My grasp of it is that you opt for the extended hire term option. You shouldn't see any monthly deductions after the first year, but you enjoy the much reduced 'transfer of ownership' deduction at the end of the longer term, due to the depreciation of the bike.

You can speak directly with Cyclescheme about it to gain a bit more clarity, before then speaking with your HR department or whomever is administering the scheme on behalf of your employer. Usually speaking with HR is best, as they are in control of the actual button-pushing involved in making the salary deduction happen.

Whichever way you do it, it's still a bloody good scheme.

One caveat though: Since you do not own the bike, it's not directly insurable (you have no 'insurable interest' in the property) via e.g. your household policy.

There *are* some insurer's out there that deal very specifically with bikes purchased using the scheme, but most insurers haven't actually caught on to this issue and I have anecdotal evidence of them paying out on a claim despite that they strictly speaking didn't have to. Ignorance is bliss.

1. Call their complaints department.

2. State your case outright.

3. Advise them that you are looking to push this to the Ombudsman because you're really now happy with them.

Claims and customer service likely don't interact that much with each other, and probably have two different sets of info/details. It's likely the renewal lot call the claims dept to get more details if necessary.

By telling them you want to go to the Ombudsman, they'll likely speed up their complaints process, because who wants a customer hanging around waiting to get their resolution for 8 weeks only to use it at the FOS.

If you do want to take it further, you can also get your details from them, including claims history and notes, and transcripts of/audio files of any call recordings they have. They'll probably charge an admin fee.

Read their [complaints process](http://www.hastingsdirect.com/customer-complaints.html), and look up the [Ombudsman's advice](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm).

correct and as it should be - you don't surplant existing plans for technology not ready yet - that would be totally amateur. plus it doesn't really solve the same problems either (capacity and speed between city centres). don't you get it - even if cars are autonomous you still have to park them somewhere in central manchester, birmingham, london - what we are trying to do is build *additional* capacity not optimise existing journeys. 

&gt; If Google achieve there date of 2017

This is the date when google say the technology will be ready - perhaps they are right. that isn't the same as the date that it will be ready to roll out for general use. thats the date when you can start piloting it (assuming there is the political will) which will take years and then you need to roll it out across the country that will take even more years. comparing that to the completion date for HS2 phase one is totally irrelevant. 

&gt; If all cars in the UK were manufactured as autonomous from 2021 onward based on current trends 50% of cars would be autonomous on UK roads by the time HS2 opens to the public.

""If"" - do you suppose that manufacturers are just going to immediately switch their entire out put to autonomous in a few years? that the public are going to just happily immediately &amp; without question swap to these cars? that's deluded. but its beside the point because:

true,BrambleBees,null,null,"I lived in Bala from the age of eight years old to about twenty.  I'm English, and living there was the worst period of my life.  I left as soon as possible.  Since your partner is an adult, he may get on a little better, since he's hopefully more able to deal with racism and being somewhat socially ostracised.  I think my experience was particularly bad because my school year happened to contain a lot of farmer's children, who are very nationalistic and anti-English.  My brother was only a couple of years behind me and he had a totally different experience.  As long as you're reasonably outgoing and sociable, you will find *some* friends.

As you might expect, there is very little to do.  The lake is nice in the summer, but throughout winter you're basically limited to the local pubs or staying in.

The schools here are not good.  I only have a little experience with the primary schools, but the high school in town is really very bad.  If you do move to Bala I would recommend sending your kids to high school elsewhere.  Dinas Bran in Llangollen is particularly good (I tutor mathematics and the students there are always among the best).  Your kids will definitely want to be able to speak Welsh in order to survive those schools.  In theory the schools are all bilingual, but in practise most of the teachers were born and raised in or around Bala and are not particularly sympathetic.

And rough, I don't know if I'd really say that.  The pubs will suffer a few fights on a Saturday night, but you don't have anything to worry about more generally.  You're not likely to be assaulted while just going about your own business, for example.  There is a lot of unemployment, so there are plenty of people hanging about who *look* rough (very judgemental, but you know the kind I mean), but they don't make too much trouble.

If you need some friends for when you move in, my sister and her fiancé still live there and they have primary-aged children.  She gets on OK despite her nationality, I imagine because she is a little older and was more able to deal with the racism, and her fiancé is a Welshman through and through :).  I suppose having an English partner softened his nationalism a bit, but he is still a proud patriot (ahem, 'CYMRU' tattooed across his should blades :\\).

Also be careful, because *sometimes* direct debit agreements cost you more than a one-off payment (like insurance products, for the most part) so that wouldn't be worth it.

The bank account you have: does that come with any kind of credit? Like a planned overdraft? You don't have to use it (in fact I recommend not unless you need to), but even having it available may help. 

Once you've got the basics as above then you can go next step up: phone contract or credit card. You probably don't want to apply for too much credit too quickly.

maybe - maybe - in 50 years - not anytime remotely soon. actually knowing someone who owns a shared fleet business - i can tell you that the public are extremely unwilling to give up owning their own car, and it only works for people who live in a city centre - he estimates you could get 5% of people to use a car like that in the medium term (10 years). funnily enough that strategy - sharing cars - is predicated on having extremely comprehensive mass transport solutions in place - specifically people only want to rely on them for occasional journeys where public transport does not reach or they have to move a lot of stuff - absolutely not for city to city or inner city journeys. if they find they don't have access to serious public transport they want to own a car so they have it to hand 100% of the time. additionally their research demonstrates that once people get older (over 30) they want the car as a status symbol - note the extreme popularity of premium brand cars when a much cheaper one is often as functional and reliable if not more so.

I think that is a good point, but Villa's performance against the lower teams does need to improve and I'm not sure that is just necessarily a matter that can be solved by diving into the transfer market (at least not by the quality of players we would be looking to buy).

What I feel we need, as a whole team, is to be able to keep going when things do not go our way in games. Maybe its the due the young age of our squad, but you do see a lot of players perform dreadfully when their head drops. We are clearly a side that is easily affected by our confidence, it means we can really take the game to top teams when we are brave and *maybe* feel like we have nothing to lose (see our game at Anfield or the last game against Chelsea), but some of the players can't string a pass together in other games (see dreadful period during winter).

We do currently have players that can help gee the team up. Currently this role is played by Gabby or Vlaar. However both these players have been out for reasonable spells due to injury, and with neither getting any younger I think we just need a change in dynamic.

How this is done, I have no idea. Sport psychologist? Lambert's managing technique? Buying in more ""leader"" types? Or just blooding the young players until they gain their own confidence?

She said that what they've done (bar the pushing you about from department to department, lack of internal communications, and general incompetence) is pretty much standard in the industry. 

Apparently: 

• The legal cover is there to cover you in case you killed or paralysed someone, or something. It's not really there to benefit you if you're the victim. 

• It would go down as a fault claim until they've closed it off by getting the money back. 

• You will therefore have to pay the higher premium and wait for a refund. 

• They won't tell you how much the refund might be as it's commercially sensitive information. 

• Because the driver was drunk he technically wasn't insured and so Hastings might *never* see the money. 

• If Hasting don't recover the money, it will *remain* as a fault claim on your file. 

• You will therefore lose your no-claims, and won't be entitled to a refund. 

• Even if the claim does go through as a no-fault, your premium will *still* go up because statistically you're more likely to suffer an accident after suffering an accident. (So you'll be better off switching).

[That's simple - because cats don't care](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-013-0620-4). [(Here's a more approachable summary)](http://www.pawnation.com/2013/12/04/cats-understand-us-ignore-us-on-purpose/?icid=maing-grid7%7Chtmlws-main-bb%7Cdl22%7Csec1_lnk3%26pLid%3D414608)

Even if one doesn't keep a dog for security reasons [they actively respond to human voices](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982214001237). They're also pack animals and like companionship. They can be trained to look after us in various ways and are a useful addition to our society. I'm not sure what cats are for except devastating the wildlife of the areas they're introduced into. That isn't just a glib comment, they were a serious menace when I was doing conservation work.

So I don't like cats because I consider them cold, useless, and problematic. I can't say I like those idiotic handbag dogs either but they're still a step above cats in my book.

That's why I say I'm a dog person, even if I don't own one. I can at least see why one would dislike dogs.

A Secular marriage is a contract, recognised and regulated by the government, concerning finances, property, children etc. I mean yes, you could write a contract yourself covering the same topics, but...

Every time something involving your homebrew marriage comes up, it has to be checked. No 'I'm his wife so it's fine.' Is it? Did you account for it in the writing of the contract? This makes... Well everything much more complex. Hospital visits, welfare, taxation, the lot.

&gt; First: No contact, similar to Sturridges dive.

Hey, good call.  You got one.  I agree.

&gt; Second: One guy chasing him, other sticks out foot, jumps over the foot.

Nope, clear contact on that one while he's running full speed.  Next!

&gt; Three: Proper hit, shouldn't be in video (still a bit slow reacting, so looks like he tries to make it worse than it is.. Acting).

Still not a dive which is what we're talking about... Next!

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysfW9TGm94E
&gt; Leg is out, jumps into out (the defender this properly shielding the ball).

The defender didn't shield the ball at all.  Messi played the ball around him and the defender moves into his way and obstructs him.  It's a clear penalty.  Com'on man.

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEZd7JMaaY
&gt; Jumps before the stamp is on his foot.

Exact same play as the first one.  So now we're repeating.

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcM9utcCEUk#t=1m52s
&gt; Famous hand ball (the rest of the vid is terrible).

Hand ball isn't diving.  Not sure what you're even trying to prove with that.

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH_63k6SYyQ
&gt; No contact.

Yes, Marcelo hits his leg from behind.  Honestly, you didn't really watch any of these games did you?  It's a grainy clip from one angle which purposefully doesn't show Marcelo clipping his foot.

&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF7VLke-KNY
&gt; Dodges the tackle, then jumps. Ref gives the corner.

Again, clear contact at the end by the defender onto his ankles at the end of the slide.


So in what I'm assuming took you a while you were able to find a single dive.  This of the most watched player in the world who is under an extreme microscope every game.

That will change.

I've had my fair share of involvement with the NHS and most of it has been good, but some of it has been extremely negative.

I'm glad it's there, but I sometimes feel that I don't quite get value for money and there are lots of inefficiencies and frankly poor staff that need to be addressed never mind the crumbling buildings.

To give just one example of poor staffing; I was in hospital recently and witnessed one member of staff who was repeatedly subjected to homophobic abuse by an elderly patient and said patient was mollycoddled by the senior staff and treated with kid gloves.

I'm sorry but that shit is just not acceptable and I don't care if the patient is 18 or 80. That nurse went to work that day to do a job and to care for his patients to the best of his ability; not to suffer homophobic abuse on a repeated basis.

That sort of treatment isn't just wrong, it's outright illegal.

One explanation might be that simply not enough firms went bust during the recession.  Banks with massive holes in their balance sheets were perhaps unwilling to write off bad debts, and instead propped up weak firms who would have gone to the wall had the banks been more healthy.

So the least performing companies, the ones that should have been driven out of business in hard times and replaced by their more efficient competitors, are still there.

I've had some similar problems today, someone was reversing out of a supermarket car park, and another driver slammed into the side of the car. The reversing car is always to blame officially. What's more, they were a named driver on their spouse's policy! The partner lost their no claims bonus, while the person reversing keeps theirs, and the driver who hit the car gets off scott free. It can be a bit ridiculous sometimes.

I won't put in a shameless plug or spam you, pm me if you want my number or want me to call and see if my underwriter can do anything in the meantime.

It might also be worth looking into temporary insurance cover for a couple of weeks. It'll still cost more overall, but should be less if your premium does drop once the claim is resolved because you can take out another year later with a competitive premium.

What happens is that they take out a credit agreement to cover repair cost and hire car, and an insurance policy to cover the risk that the other person's insurance company refuses to cover the cost. The only thing that you have to agree to is that you may have to go to court if there is a dispute. You have to make sure that you don't run up unnecessary costs such as keeping the hire car longer than necessary. 

The company makes money by charging interest on the loan for the hire car which puts pressure on the insurers to pay up. In a way I think that the claims management industry only exists because insurance companies are such bastards when they are dealing with private individuals.

Harry brought JD back (part of it was tied to Pompey still owing us cash), Kaboul (again Pompey owed us cash), Kranky (Pompey/Cash), Crouchie, Gallas, Friedel, Parker, Ade.

He also had some misses in Palacios (£12m), Chimbonda, Bassong, Pienaar, The Ginger Pele Jamie O'Hara and he tried to buy Charlie Adam, Stuart Downing and Andy Carroll.

Broomfield (who to be fair Harry brought in) was the one responsible for driving us to purchase the likes of Sandro and Vertonghen.

So all parties had some misses as well as wins. Comolli however did miss big when he missed, very, very big.

Harry did convert Bale from a LB to a LM which was huge (and of course led to Taxi for Maicon which was the first step to Bale being worth £86m), and he did try him at a CAM/SS role though it only really worked the first time he tried it (may have been against Norwich, can't remember) and then it sorta of crashed and burned because he never figured out how to get the rest of the squad to function with Bale in that role. AVB (for all his flaws) was the one who figured out how to get Bale and the squad to function with Bale as the free roaming menace in the middle of the pitch (Bale's natural development also played a part).

Harry did a great deal of good for us and obviously had a great deal of success.  But he was also the same guy who fucked off for 3 months and cost us CL when he was on trial for his dog's taxes and waiting for the England job. He barely rotated the squad (insisted on starting Crouch at striker over damn near anyone else) and wore our team into the ground and would routinely get out coached by the top managers in the league.

Harry did great things for us, but he wasn't ever going to be the answer to our management situation.

Unfortunately we are often victims of the insane undercutting practices that goes on and several companies will look for any number of loop-holes to avoid paying out on their policies. This is not helped by the sheer number of people fraudulently using the system to claim money to which they are not entitled. I would say on average, I deal with about 8 to 10 fraud cases a week. For motor-insurance cases you could probably triple or quadruple that number. 

If someone comes to me and says how can I get a cheaper premium for my car insurance, I tell them plainly, 'don't have a crash' because the underwriters will fuck you in the arse for the rest of your living days. You need to find yourself a very committed and sound broker to deal with that, and unfortunately with this market being squeezed from all angles - these types of people are few and far between. 

I was really shocked when I started out working for a number of insurance companies just how very little emphasis was placed on knowing the market but more on selling very bad policies to the customers. Its all about sales and numbers rather than providing the best service and ultimately the best policy available.

Car-crashes are the worst because they can get very complex and often farcical. You basically have two companies in such a case - and neither will pay out. It requires a lot of communication from both sides and if you have poorly trained and unmotivated staff you get cases such as yours. They will employ all manner of tactics to draw out the claim to avoid paying out.

Utterly, utterly false. In the years leading up to privatisation we had more spare capacity than we knew what to do with. One of the early things many companies did was to close many stations to save a lot of cash and strip out bureaucracy. In fact a few of them were even fined because it was found they were only closing down stations to push up the wholesale price of electricity. And now here we are in 2014, and power companies are threatening power shortages. This is a direct result of their abysmal underinvestment in the two decades they have held the reins. You keep banging on about comparing our bills to those in Europe, but a better metric and one that actually answers the question would be to compare the bills to __what we actually paid before__.

Time and again this leads to huge fuck-ups on a very costly scale because the ITT-runners selected the cheapest bid, even though it either did not fulfill the requirements stipulated in the ITT or - worse - selected the cheapest bid which *claimed* to fulfill the ITT requirements but actually could not.

Both these choices lead to the NHS and other government agencies having to then put out another ITT to fix the problems caused by their poor selection first time around, while hemorrhaging public money in taking the first selected bidder to court to recoup losses for failing to provide the services contracted for... The latter rarely proves cost-efficient, and nowadays most government departments don't even bother fighting it in court because it's a waste of time and money.

Then of course there's the problem of maintaining facilities which were built in post-war Britain - often not even purpose-built, but adapting even older buildings which are now Grade I or II Listed and therefore *cannot* be modernised...",0,1395171881,null,0,false,0,cg5uvb8,t3_20oz92,t1_cg5uvb8,t1_cg5i8aw,null,1432963874,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Extract 1 - *""Morris, who has a child of her own, would have regular intercourse with the boy, now 14, and was only found out after he was overheard bragging about it at school.""*

Sorry, that isn't rape if the kid is bragging in school. However, there is a reasoning behind the sentence, if you bothered to read the article without just sensationalizing the title;

Extract 2 - *""The judge in the case told Morris that he would be lenient with the sentence - which will see her released from jail after one year - because she 'realised it was wrong' and stopped having sex with the boy.""*

/u/fat-jonesy
&gt; A small tip, you can remove the mounts (permanently) by just heating them up with a hairdryer. They basically peel off. No, I haven't lost any cameras during the summer months!

&gt;You can then use 3M sticky tape to cover the bottom of the plastic bit and re-use it. I ended up using outdoor, high end 3M stuff they use to stick bits of cars.

That's very helpful! I was worried I would have to splash out on these holders since I'm terrible at putting things on the way I want, especially screen protectors, heh. 

/u/notmentat
&gt;Hehe, I just bought a Ghost S too, and was wondering the same thing.

&gt;I have a Bluetooth set on the bottom left of my helmet, so I'm thinking of putting this on bottom right. But I also want to get some sort of mount for the bike, be it tank or handlebar mount too.

It's been a struggle to find some advice from Google, the Drift Ghosts are not as popular as the GoPro's, or at least not as much people asking questions related to this product.

I'd like to have cameras all over my bike, see the view from every angle, heh, but would be such a pain to setup the cameras, plus all that money.

I suppose though with you having your Bluetooth on the left, you could use your Drift as a counter weight? Though I'm sure the Bluetooth device would be a lot lighter.

/u/G_A
&gt; Lots of recommendations for the side so far. I'm going to suggest the top.

&gt;I've tried both extensively, and I'll happily suffer looking like a Pikmin for the sake of the camera's field of view.

&gt;Instantly you've not a portion of the video with helmet in the way, you're also able to pull it further back and still retain a forward facing angle.

That's been the opposing debate for me, with the helmet on top not only can you have a larger field of view, without your helmet taking up half the video, but not having that weight on the side of your helmet pulling so slightly, and possible more aerodynamic? 

The thing about putting it on top of my helmet is that it will be quite high up, I'd like to see my motorcycle in the video, like the handle bars, from watching Baron Von Grumble, you can usually only see his bike when he looks down. But, I truly won't know until I test it out for myself.

And Suarez was indeed progressing, but he was firing shots everywhere but in the net. He had something like 10% strike rate and was constantly diving, bickering with the officials and being a cunt in general. Brendan has sorted him out and made him a contributor to the team. Everyone knew the potential was there, it just had to be unlocked. And now Gerrard has urged the owners to get BR a new contract and that he's the best manager he's worked with. Speaks volumes! Remains to be seen if we ever achieve anything or if we end up like Arsenal these last ten years. 

I find it really odd that Tottenham spent so much money on Lamela. Soldado and Paulinho were solid I think, at least the thought behind them. Soldado has been prolific for a long time and Paulinho was solid in Brazil. Lamela on the other hand seemed like he was such a great fit in Italy, and it's safe to say that a player being successful in Italy is no good indicator as to how good he'll be in the prem.

Secondly by doing this your effecting the traffic behind and on long roads could cause massive tailbacks.

Then they proceeded to call us up once a week following the incident to ask ""how we're doing"" and if we've had any leads tracking *our* stolen laptops or Kindles etc. Literally all of the ideas there were to track the thieves came from us - and I don't think they ever did contact Amazon to get them to release the tracking info for us. 

Then they feel that they're somehow giving a good service by sending a patrol car around the area maybe twice a week at around 4pm - and doing door-to-door stops where they tell you ""did you know, you should close your windows and lock up when you leave the house?"".

true,chickenburgerr,null,null,"I'm honestly not looking forward to it.  I thought killing off moriarty was a good move, because not only would it prevent the character being overused but also allow the series to use new villains and new material but now it looks like he's being brought back because he's a fan favourite.  I can't help but expect he's going to become a flanderised caricature and bringing him back makes him and his ending lose all their gravity.  So it turns out neither of them died so the S2 finale may as well not happened.

I blame Moffat.  After a period of time his shows start to resemble fan fiction, the main heros become smug untouchable geniuses who can easily escape any scenario with lazy writing.  Case in point the immensely unsatisfying ending to the S3 finale where Sherlock's amazing solution to defeating the main antagonist was to just shoot him.  Which seems like a heroic act of self-sacrifice because it means prison, but then they decide they're going to let him go because Moriarty might be alive again.  But that's okay, because I imagine the next episode will end up with Sherlock just shooting Moriarty in the face, shrugging whilst the rest of the cast go ""Oh Sherlock"", circle to black over Benedict Cumberbatch's Easter Island trollface.

I don't know what shit they are going to pull out of their ass to explain how Moriarty fake blew his brains out and no one including Sherlock or the Police realised he was still alive.  The only two reasonable explanations are that either they're going to rip off the Saw franchise or that Moriarty is actually a time lord and he regenerated into a less believable version of himself.

It was right to sack him (short term) as apparently he fell out with everyone at the club and results obviously weren't in his favour. 

AVB needs time to install his ideas and tactics to his players. If you know how he got Porto playing, it was very high pressure/line ensuring that when they rewon possession that they could turn that into an attack quickly. All of that requires a lot of work from all the players, defenders ensuring they're all level, the typical Midfield trio conducting the retaining/passing/playmaking and the front three cutting (Hulk) for shooting opportunities. Its very attacking but requires a lot of time and certain players with high work rate to do all that. He simply wasn't given the time to develop the players into his mould, Chelsea he wasn't given time and with us, we sold his Hulk (Bale) and didn't buy another deep lying playmaker (Moutinho) instead he got Dembele who is nothing like that.

Above all, his beard and hair is fucking magnificent.

Right, here's what I would say. The formatting is great, and it has exactly the right type of information in it.

I would recommend getting rid of your date of birth, it tends to be a little bit of an iffy one to have on a CV; while I can't speak for someone your age I can say that as someone in my 20's it does more harm than good.

The only major change I would recommend is to perhaps restructure your profile at the top, it's a little bit fragmented in places and reads more like a series of bullet points than a profile.


&gt; I am currently studying for my A-Levels at “School in Location”; my subjects are English Language, ICT and Media Studies and I was the Deputy Head Boy from March 2013 to early March 2014.
&gt; 
&gt; Last summer, I took part in the National Citizenship Service (NCS). A programme culminating in organising a social 
&gt; 
&gt; community project to help boost the self esteem of children and adults with learning disabilities. 
&gt; 
&gt; At “School” I also help mentor younger students in English and Spanish classes. Previously, I was elected Tutor Representative and attended school meetings and workshop days; and from time to time I help at the local End Polio Now charity. Also, I help run an after school film club.

&gt; My main hobby/interest is Film and Cinema and I have taken part in various Raindance courses to develop my film-making skills. I hope to be studying Film Production at university and then to follow a career in the film industry; I am particularly interested in screen writing and directing. 
&gt; 
&gt; In my free time I also enjoy trampolining and have previously taken various belts in Jujitsu. 
&gt; 
&gt; I enjoy being with people from different backgrounds and being part of a team; and feel that I could fit easily into a team and make a valuable contribution.

Well apart from Tavish Scott, the MSP for Shetland, who mooted this a few months ago. But given his complete and utter disinterest in more autonomy for Shetland right up until the independence referendum campaign (I don't recall him saying anything like this when he wanted re-election), it might just be argued that he's not entirely sincere, and this is just yet another scare-story from persons aligned with the No campaign.

Considering where we were I think that Levy has done wonders to get the club as competitive as it is now, especially considering the rise of limitless-budget clubs like Man City and Chelsea. When you considering that we can't compete with them financially, it seems like Levy does some incredible business. At the end of the day he *is* a businessman, but one that has done well for Tottenham Hotspur. Are there any chairmen of clubs that *aren't* businessmen? I would take Levy any day over Vincent Tan or someone that would wallow in mid-table stability just to turn a profit.

I haven't noticed the camera catching on the wind at speed, it's already a nice profile similar to Contour vs a GoPro, I do know that the one inconvenience I have found is that without detaching the camera I can only fit one helmet into my Givi box, which is the largest they offer, instead of the two I could without the camera.

I've infact gone one step further and have a 20 amp battery pack that sits in the topbox, which I pull out and keep in a chest pocket with a wire leading to the camera keeping it charged if I'm on a multiple hour ride out. Imagine mulitplying the battery capacity of the 2 amp battery that comes with your camera tenfold.

* Hazard is amazing, like usual

* Ramires couldn't make a good pass to save his life
* Terry is amazing
* Cahill is amazing
* Azplicueta is a god
* Ivanovic is always solid defensively but terrible going forward..
* Kalas gets his time, although I would have preferred him to come on with atleast a few min to run around and get a touch or two
* Torres is still useless
* Schurrle makes some great runs still

My only negative thing I took away from this performance is that we got into the box too many times to only score 2 goals. Too many plays broke up once we got into their box, we need to shoot more, especially Hazard. For someone with such a nice shot he is only a bit too generous with the ball sometimes.

It wasn't until two weeks ago that I was able to get ahold of someone selling tickets at a fair price in one of the small supporters groups I'm a part of. We were elated. I decided to to wait to book the train into London until the tickets arrived... they never came. Even the really local, small groups that are usually reliable were infiltrated with scammers this time around. We haven't seen Chelsea play in over a year and we really could only make one game this year. We settled on Drogba's return. Alas.

During the time waiting on the tickets I found out I didn't get a big grant I had applied for, so I was all the more looking forward to us making the match. 

We both came down with fevers today. Our internet stopped working right at the start of the match, and we had to go to our local where we didn't make the match until 30 minutes into the first half.

But once I saw the way we played, the way Hazard was taking on defenders and will be for years to come, the way Mourinho had the tactics just right against Mancini, the impenetrable wall of England's best centre back pairing,  Dave, Ramires, and Willian looking tireless, Lampard continuing on to be a bastion of calm control, Kalas getting an appearance and representing our youth, and Drogba and Cech embracing at the end, it was all alright and worthwhile. 

I remember having to celebrate the 2010 season end with the eight - nil over Wigan at the only place  that was showing the match where I was, a small Kebab shop. It was early in the morning, with no commentary on a dusty, faded television, and I dropped down and kissed the badge with a bunch of people clueless around me.

We probably will not get to make it to a match now at the Bridge this year, even if we are able to get our money back through the bank for the tickets we missed out on. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you live in the UK or abroad,  have never seen the team play live or go to every match, have season tickets or no tickets, what matters is the loyalty and legacy.

There seems to be a common opinion here that LVG is in the Guardiola, Mourinho and Ancelotti bracket of manager who is a solution to all our ailments. The fact of the matter he isn't. That's what I am getting at in reference to his success in terms of silverware. He has persistently had fallings out with both playing staff and the board as was the case in his term as technical director at Ajax and his fallings out with Rivaldo and Luca Toni. Additionally he had frankly a Ramos esque second spell at Barca leaving them three points off the relegation zone. Most of his success came at Ajax with their dream team in the 90s he really hasnt set the world alight apart from that. In regards to the slapping down of my opinion about Sherwood over Van Gaal. Sherwood has done pretty fucking well for his first ever job as a top manager while inheriting a team in utter disarray back in January most of us were hailing him as the second coming of Jesus a poor spell and he is ""nowhere near good enough"" and ""tactically inept"" the team was absolutely decimated by injuries, do you think the Dortmund fans were crucifying Klopp when they have suffered bad defeats due to some of their team being out through injury? Every game Sherwood will improve we have no idea as to the ceiling for him. For LVG to get us firing on all cylinders it will take us a season if we're lucky, do you think if we are utter gash that season and finish 8th Hugo, Vertonghen and Eriksen are going to stick around while Van Gaal is chucking his sack in their face? I don't think so.

&gt; If your saying that the road is more dangerous because people don't all observe the speed limit and also drive aggressively then your experience actually supports the findings of the linked document.

I'm saying the road is safer when everyone obeys the speed limits and the way to get most people to do this is to *set appropriate speed limits*. Your document appears to ignore this possibility and instead mistakenly assumes that all speed limits are already appropriate when this is patently not the case.

&gt; I agree with you if your saying that all people should observe speed limits, while not driving dangerously and driving in an appropriate manner for the conditions.

Many of the episodes he was in would have been successful without him but his personality added to the dynamic of the group. Maybe with an older Doctor, Jack would maybe suit the role again. I'm not sure he'd have worked very well as his energy was very similar to 11's but Jack never fails to add a bit more excitement to a more withdrawn Doctor's performance. His story might be up but unlike River, he could be very well used in the odd one-off rather than involving him in a story ark.

BT is being investigated by the UK's data authority after a whistleblower claimed the company ""exposed user credentials en masse"".

http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/121613-report-accuses-bt-of-supplying-276975.html

 A paper released earlier this month by a group of security researchers has outlined the technical details behind a potential Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) program likely used by the U.K. Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and their American counterpart, the NSA.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/16/bruce_schneier_leaves_bt/

Exclusive Noted security guru Bruce Schneier, who has spent a great deal of energy publicly analysing the Edward Snowden leaks into the activities of the NSA and allied spy agencies, is to leave UK telco BT.

A spokesman for BT said: “We can confirm that Bruce Schneier, BT’s security futurologist, is leaving BT at the end of December 2013.”

Rob Partridge , a manager with telecommunications company BT who helped spearhead the competition, said: ""Some of this is a little bit tongue-in-cheek."" Still, ""it's the kind of stuff that might happen.""
In a private area in the back of the Churchill War Rooms, a complex of underground offices originally built to protect top officials from Nazi bombs, 42 contestants were clustered around seven tables amid the crimson glow of red diodes. Staff from BT, British signals intelligence agency GCHQ and other companies paced the floor as the youngsters parsed code and tracked packets of data across an imaginary network.

true,umuttu,null,null,"&gt; At the time, it was thought churches and religious organisations would have to marry same-sex couples or face being sued by the ECHR.

Apart from the fact that the ECHR doesn't sue people (it's a court), the only people who ""thought"" this were people who were strongly against same-sex marriage in principle.  If the ECHR would object to churches refusing to marry same-sex couples, wouldn't you think they would also object to churches refusing to marry couples of a different religion, or trans people, or divorced people, for example?  There are already numerous countries that are parties to the ECHR and have legalised same-sex marriage, but none of them have seen court cases like this.

&gt; http://www.trendingcentral.com/gay-couple-to-sue-church-over-gay-marriage-opt-out/

This is kind of different, since it's the Church of England - that is, it's effectively part of the government and will generally marry anyone who asks them - and since the couple's vicar wants to marry them but is not allowed to by the C of E's governing body.  Given that the ECHR has recently ruled that governments don't have to allow same-sex marriage at all, it's pretty hard to imagine the couple winning their case, though.

&gt; But I don't see why the government should have a place in homosexual or heterosexual marriages or civil partnerships, no matter if they are secular or religious.

There are lots of legal consequences of marriage/civil partnership.  It changes your position with respect to tax, pensions, immigration and inheritance, among other things.  You can argue that those legal consequences should be done away with (this would be unpopular and you would probably have to phase it in over a long period of time so that people wouldn't suddenly lose their income or right to live in the UK*), but while we have them, the government has to recognise and regulate marriage.
