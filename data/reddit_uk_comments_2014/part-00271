true,whistling_unicorn,null,null,"I'm not going to search for anything, because there might not be anything directly but that's irrelevant, it not about what anyone's said, its about actions let me explain. 'Westminster' is our parliament it may not be perfect but we all control it, its like if you work for a company and you don't agree with a lot of the big picture stuff they do but you have lots of friends who work there and you have a great life there and generally things are pretty good, you get paid well you have a nice house you get promotions, its fun and a nice place to work, you really can't complain. 

Then a load of your friends at the company start telling you that it's a corrupt company that its being unfair to a lot of its workers, that they're not being represented, that they're being under paid, that they're being forced into doing something they hate. Well you have the exact same job as these repressed underpaid under represented people and actually you think it's pretty good, you like it. Your friends are saying that they're going to try to take down the company, they're going to do a mass walk out and it's going to seriously fuck up the future of the company, they'll be OK, they're going to set up a new company, but you really liked your job it was great, and despite being in the same position as them you don't really have a problem with the company as a whole. You'd change some things, but you don't want to tear it apart. The new company will be small but I'll be able to grow and when it does it'll provide jobs similar to the one you've had your whole life and that'll be great for those guys but probably not a whole lot better than the current one, I mean things are pretty good now!, But the company you work for is going to face a bit of trouble for a few years, and your job won't be quite as good as it was before.

That is, as at as I can explain how most English people feel now. 

So it doesn't matter what the yes campaign says, its what its doing.

Now I should add this isn't completely how I feel I have more than a few issues with the management of the company, but I think fundamentally I like working for them, and while I want to change a few things, I don't want to burn it to the ground.

This is interesting...

true,MMSTINGRAY,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"&gt;said that while there would be risks in the event of a Yes vote, the risks of Scotland remaining in the union and UK leaving the EU would be ‚Äúsignificantly greater‚Äù.

For this point to be valid as ""Scotland is better off independent"" you need to assume it is very likely for Britain to leave the EU.

&gt;‚ÄúScotland can make investments in tidal energy, or in its young people; it can strive to increase female labour force participation and provide for early childhood education-both essential for creating a fairer society.

This can be true of the UK. Whether we maintain the status quo, see an independent Scotland *or* great power given to Scotland while remaining part of the union. We need to deal in realities and facts, insofar as we can and this is just conjecture.

He also doesn't address *why* Scotland can be guarenteed a place in the EU. It doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong, it is just an opinion and not an argument if he doesn't explain why.

Also he is an advisor to the Scottish government. So you feel he is less biad than completely independent analysists? 

Even going so far as saying things like

&gt;The Scottish vision and values are different from those that have become dominant south of the border. 

Also

&gt;It can make these investments, knowing that the country will recapture more of the benefits from them through taxation. 

Can you please show me the working?

&gt;‚ÄúThe difficult question that Scotland has to face is thus not about arcane issues about monetary arrangements or economies of scope, about the minutiae of the short run gains and losses, but whether Scotland‚Äôs future ‚Äì its shared vision and values, a shared vision and values that has increasingly departed from those dominant south of the border ‚Äì will be better achieved through independence.

Nice rhetoric. Proves nothing, demonstrates nothing and doesn't explain why Scotland needs to be independent and why it would be good for them.


Also if you are going to lecture me about news sources, I don't just look at the BBC and nor are newspapers the only place I read about this sort of thing, then maybe you shoudl go a bit further afield than Channel 4 and The Scotland Herald. 

As for the North Sea stuff you should probably do some research on the estimates of their value. A few of the leading people in BP and Shell say Salmond has ""hugely exaggerated"" their value.

That documentary contains interviews with several reporters from various outlets, including the BBC. They confess that they allowed themselves to be manipulated by the US' media management, including the access they got through being ""embedded"" reporters.

So: 1. There's nothing special about the BBC in this regard, and 2. That's not ""BBC bias"", that's the US' (and UK's) military manipulating the media.

I would hope that the BBC and others have learned their lesson, and that they will be more resistant to being manipulated in the future.

The fact is that regardless of your own political opinions, you live in a globalised capitalist world, one that is unlikely to transition into full Marxism any time soon.  The backbone of that world is the financial institutions that fund it, ie. the banks.   If Scotland wants inward investment, it'll be through the banks.  If Scotland wants to explore new oil reserves, that upstream development will be funded by the banks.  If Scotland wants to facilitate trade with the rest of the world, it will be via the banks.   New countries require capital inflow to expand, and that capital inflow will be facilitated by financial institutions. 

In order to maintain even a semblance of its current prosperity, Scotland needs to import the goods and services it needs, and export the goods and services it makes, to the rest of the capitalist world.  If you want to continue trading with America, you don't nationalise American companies.  If you want to continue trading with the UK (without which Scotland would collapse), you don't nationalise British companies (whether BP or the banks or whatever).   What the article points out is that Scotland will have to lower taxes to attract investment, making Salmond's grand socialist plans impossible, destroying the entire argument of the Yes campaign.  

If Scotland cannot effectively compete in the globalised capitalist system then it is, provided it cannot achieve total self sufficiency, effectively a failed state before it has even begun.

true,whole_scottish_milk,null,null,"&gt; For this point to be valid as ""Scotland is better off independent"" you need to assume it is very likely for Britain to leave the EU.

Do you think he meant that for Scotland to be successful, the UK must be out of the EU? Because that would be rather silly.

&gt;This can be true of the UK. Whether we maintain the status quo, see an independent Scotland or great power given to Scotland while remaining part of the union. We need to deal in realities and facts, insofar as we can and this is just conjecture.

Could be. Isn't.

&gt;He also doesn't address why Scotland can be guarenteed a place in the EU. It doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong, it is just an opinion and not an argument if he doesn't explain why.

The question isn't why, the question is why not? Why would Europe try to expel 5 million people in nation teeming with resources? 

They wouldn't, and they won't. 

Not to mention, Norway isn't even in the EU yet they seem to be doing just fine, so its not like it would be the end of the world anyway.

&gt;Also he is an advisor to the Scottish government. So you feel he is less biad than completely independent analysists?

Where are the UK government getting their ""independent"" analysis?

What about Shell and Aberdeen Asset Managemnt? Are they basing their investments on Salmond's lies and speculation?

Here's an Irish economist, I think this qualifies as independent analysis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF9amPncOus

&gt;Nice rhetoric. Proves nothing, demonstrates nothing and doesn't explain why Scotland needs to be independent and why it would be good for them.

Yes it does. It quite clearly implies that we would no longer be under the influence of Westminster, who have squandered all our wealth for decades.

&gt;Also if you are going to lecture me about news sources, I don't just look at the BBC and nor are newspapers the only place I read about this sort of thing, then maybe you shoudl go a bit further afield than Channel 4 and The Scotland Herald.

But your only sources are British media outlets. All quite obviously pro-union. 

&gt;As for the North Sea stuff you should probably do some research on the estimates of their value. A few of the leading people in BP and Shell say Salmond has ""hugely exaggerated"" their value. Of something like 2 billion pounds. Still not sure if Salmond is a sociopath or an idiot.

He's actually an economist who has spent much of his life involved in North Sea oil. If you knew much about oil, you would know that nobody can give you an accurate figure on oil. You just picked the one that fits your argument and are using it as fact.

Okay, let me correct that, a business that can't use its substantial political ties would not be bailed out. Even so, its irrelevant, as you can probably guess I also wouldn't support this. 

&gt; So what do you want? They did let Lehman Brothers collapse exactly for the reasons you mentioned and it was a complete disaster. And Lehman was actually small within the big banks. Also the whole system completely changed since the crisis. There is more regulation than ever (and the financial industry has been the most regulated industry even before the crisis).

Just because I do not support the solution that was implemented doesn't mean that I propose that there shouldn't have been any solution. 

Your response is essentially the same, as replying to ""I do not support the death penalty"" with ""So you would just have murderers roam freely?"" Clearly, this is not what was said, or even hinted at.

The failed banks could have been taken over by the central bank. The bad assets could have been split off into a vehicle that could have been then left to fail. As the central bank has taken over viable assets, it could then spin these off and sell them on the market, whilst it services any withdrawals in the meantime. Because the central bank can print money, the tax payer would also not have had to provide for this, and the state would not have had to take on further debt. 

Still I don't think I need to provide a better solution, to validate the fact that the implemented solution was bad.

In the event of a Scottish vote for independence, the UK government will act in the interests of its remaining citizens. It will have no duty to the citizens of Scotland. I am greatly concerned that you do not seem to have grasped this fundamental reality of what it means to vote for independence from the UK. 

&gt; The No campaign have even said as much.

One immediately disavowed comment from an unnamed government minister is scant evidence that the UK's position on a currency union is a bluff. What's more likely? That all three UK parties have decided to deliberately lie to the UK electorate on such an important topic as currency union, and will subsequently make themselves unelectable in rUK just to be nice to voters in another country? Or that the single suggestion that a currency union was on the table was the result of a minister who didn't know what the fuck he or she was talking about showing off for reporters?

I don't really support that either but in reality most big companies/industries are defacto too big to fail. At some point corporate lobbyists and the unions will both support a bail out and it's very unattractive for political leaders to simply not do anything and let thousands of people loss their jobs.

&gt; The failed banks could have been taken over by the central bank. The bad assets could have been split off into a vehicle that could have been then left to fail. As the central bank has taken over viable assets, it could then spin these off and sell them on the market, whilst it services any withdrawals in the meantime. Because the central bank can print money, the tax payer would also not have had to provide for this, and the state would not have had to take on further debt. 

Switzerland did this, the CB bought the bad assets from UBS. It was quite successful. But interestingly this has been criticized by left wingers because they wanted the government to have an equity share to be able to influence the bank.

Given Ludogorets level I'm wondering if it's better to rest Hendo now or play with as many players as possible from last season. Would probably go with a midfield diamond of Gerrard, Hendo, Coutinho with Lallana in front and forward line of Sterling and Balo. Sterling was so excellent before due to sticking close to Suarez/Sturridge, lately he has been forced to drop deeper and deeper and it's common to see him collecting ball from CB. I want to see him forced a bit further up and work between Lallana and Balo. Should also allow Lallana to get a bit of taste of the system in competitive match. His understand with Sterling and Balo will be vital when he eventually becomes part of midfield 3 when Sturridge returns.

""The Yes campaign also promises that post-divorce negotiations will take place in an atmosphere of complete calm and rationality ‚Äì and that rump Britain will give it what it wants. But that glosses over the fact that the other side has demands, too. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said recently that, if Britain didn‚Äôt let an independent Scotland continue to use the pound, Scotland might refuse to assume its share of the national debt.

Mr. Salmond has the greatest interest in maintaining the fiction that normalcy will reign and reason will rule in the event of a Yes victory ‚Äì and yet the mere mention of a hypothetical negotiation has even him testily making threats. How well do you think it will go if things move beyond the hypothetical? Having looked over the edge of the precipice that you are marching up to, and having dipped our toe into the volcano more than once, we can tell you: It will not go well at all.""

However, in Scotland this ignorance is probably fueling the ""No"" vote more than the ""Yes"" vote: ""I dont understand so I'll just vote 'No'"".

Despite grandstanding from English political leaders, its overwhelmingly likely that a currency union will be struck. It is in neither country's interests to set up trade barriers, the English do not want to be foisted with all UK debt, and Scotland would like to retain a voice in the fine tuning of cash creation.

The real issue is ""how easy would it be for Scotland to form its own central bank?"" The answer is that it would probably not be quite as difficult as it might seem. Scotland has legal autonomy, and a well established banking system with the capability to mint and distribute currency. It has a history of Economic philosophy, and a large, educated financial workforce to draw on.

The article outlines scenarios which are unlikely- chiefly the appropriation of North Sea oil by rUK (unfeasable due to maritime boundaries and the Scottish monoploy on knowhow and materiel), and it also ignores the sheer strength of Scottish output (http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26614122).

Whatever their reasons are the beheading of an innocent man is evil. It isn't an act of war or an attempt at revenge, it's just trying to scare people into doing what you want.

But NOT for me. I want to know every detail in advance.

Did you know that we used to know details about stories and who the next Doctors would be a year or more in advance before we ever saw the stories. Colin Baker was already the Doctor before we ever saw any Davision stories. Sylvester McCoy was doing fund raising spots on PBS fund drives long before we ever saw any of his stories.

And we like it like that. This idea that you can't know anything in advance is fine for those who feel that way but what this community needs to accept is that not everyone feels that way and to stop downvoting us because we have a different view.

The moderators have a very reasonable 48 hour period in which information about an aired episode is considered a spoiler and I support that policy. 

But what I don't like is being told that I shouldn't be here because I haven't seen an episode when that is the very fact I am here, trying to learn the details before I watch.

Really, no. Just no.

At the peak of the construction boom in 2007, around 20% of the entire male population of Ireland was employed in building/real estate/property. Renewable energy accounts for 7.2% of current Irish energy needs. Ireland has [limited if any offshore oil and gas reserves](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/crude-alert-the-facts-behind-irish-oil-and-gas-exploration-210841.html). Irish national debt ran at 127% of GDP. In higher education, seven institutions in Ireland make it into the top 500 worldwide. And Irish shipyards built precisely no aircraft carriers over the past few years.

In contrast: Scotland actually had less of a housing bubble than England, never mind Ireland. Scotland is currently at 50% renewables for energy, with a target of 100% by 2020 and becoming a net energy exporter (from renewables) thereafter. Assuming Scotland's national debt is par for UK as a whole, it's around 87% of GDP. University-wise, Scotland has five institutions in the top 200 worldwide (one in the top 50 -- quite an achievement for a country with 0.07% of the world population). Scotland has the largest oil reserves in western Europe; and as for the aircraft carriers ...

I said this in another thread the other day, but, in my uninformed opinion, it would be better to split the country up into regions, and have people vote for both candidates to represent them in that region, and candidates to represent that region in a full UK parliament. These regions would be fairly autonomous, not necessarily choosing how much to tax or minimum wage (it would only cause an extension of this 'race to the bottom' effect we see on an international scale), but choosing what projects to fund and stuff. 

This would mean regions would have greater local influence, and many of the politicians making decisions in those regions would live locally and (hopefully) understand local issues better, but people would also have influence over decisions that effect the entire UK. It would also (hopefully) make politicians more accountable, as, for example, the head of the Midlands regional parliament would have more power, and therefore take more blame, than my local MP, who can realistically do nothing major in Dudley South.

Indeed one country charges fees for courses in English, but not in its native language. Hence as a product of proximity, shared language and high rates of English fees, English students will uniquely be able to take advantage of Scottish further education if it is free, and more likely drive the cost of fees in Scotland above 0, and likely higher than Irish fees currently are due to the proximity of Scotland to England.

It wasn't specifically stated, but it is heavily implied that she is his great grandmother.

I had a lot of close calls even then and nearly went of the road because of lack of cornering practice.

The supposed fluid attacking front line only works if every player communicates well about their fluidity with every other player.  If Lamela isn't doing that, and in so failing hurts Eriksen's ability to contribute to the attack, then they're not playing well together and one or both of them need to change their attitude toward their designated positions.

&gt;You can't argue that the Doctor's fear-creature was real and neither can you argue that the creature in Pink's room wasn't real.

Certainly you can. What we (the audience) saw may not have been what was actually *there*. It could have simply been what Clara was imagining. They had their backs turned, told not to look at it, not even the reflection in the glass. That's enough to make anyone's imagination run wild.

Before that, it could have been a kid under the blanket, like the Doctor said. People saying it vanished to moved super-fast need to watch it again. There's a long pause when the camera is on the Doctor's face before the door slams. A kid could have left in that time‚Ä¶ and that's assuming the kid ever approached them at the window in the first place. Fear+imagination, remember? The kid under the blanket may have gotten down from the bed and moved towards the door immediately, only slamming it shut later, afraid of what the Doctor was saying.

While I would argue it is more of a hypocritical sort of centre-left, I agree it would have been best to say grand 'social democratic' plans I suppose.   The SNP supporters saying that benefits will go up, that thousands of new homes will be built, that the rich will be 'made to pay', that land taxes will fund massive civic works, that the SNHS will be much better than it is, that social services will have massive increases in funding, that wages will increase massively, and so on are speaking total bollocks.   The economic argument that the people of Scotland will go to sleep in the UK with a median salary of $45k and wake up in Norway with a median salary of $90k is ridiculous, but it's what many members of the SNP have been hinting at, or even outright suggesting.  

Markets require, or at the very least strongly favour, stability.  That's why everyone goes and buys gold or US government bonds when the economy goes to shit.

&gt;apostates are still being killed for leaving the religion

Here's an example, from the same Wikipedia page I linked to above:

&gt;Somalia:  

&gt;Apostasy is a crime in Somalia.[166] Articles 3(1) and 4(1) of Somalia's constitution declare that religious law of Sharia is the nation's highest law. The punishment for apostasy prescribed is death penalty.[177][178]

&gt;There have been numerous reports of execution of people for apostasy, particularly of Muslims who have converted to Christianity. However, the reported executions have been by extra-state Islamist groups and local mobs, rather than after the accused has been tried under a Somali court of law.

Sudan:

&gt;Some notable cases of apostasy in Sudan include: Mahmoud Mohammed Taha, a Sudanese religious thinker, leader, and trained engineer, who was executed for apostasy in 1985 at the age of 76 by the regime of Gaafar Nimeiry.[181][182] Meriam Ibrahim, a 27-year-old Christian Sudanese woman was sentenced to death for apostasy in May 2014, but allowed to leave the country in July after an international outcry.[183]

When anyone has talked of ""more powers"", either at the start of the referendum campaign or last week, they don't mean anything beyond this legislation.

The only agreement beyond that is that someone (probably Gordon Brown) will host some kind of constitutional convention after the referendum.

You can say that, but what you've posted here indicates otherwise. Of course I doubt you actually believe that, I also doubt you've ever really experienced any real terrorism in your life. 

You just think you're being edgy. Unfortunately it comes off pathetic. You say i'm incapable of reason yet you're so caught up in your view that everything happening in the middle east is ""our"" fault you can't accept that just maybe what's happening there is actually vile, and evil regardless of the reasons behind it.

&gt; I think it's pathetic you cannot acknowledge the violence and death committed on our behalf with our money by our forces, that is why journalists and aid workers were there in the first place

I've said this several times actually. I can acknowledge that ""we"" caused a lot of the problems there, I have never tried to deny that. Unlike you I can see that what's happening there goes beyond that. What's happening there is vile people seizing power now that they have the opportunity. That's not to say they have no reason, or right, to do so. Just that the way they are going about it is evil.

&gt; presumably you believe our actions are noble, justified and good, and that only acts against us can be evil.

As I've already said, I grew up in Belfast, i've seen what our army does when it's occupying other countries. I have not once tried to deny ""we"" have done wrong. I just refuse to accept that the appropriate response is terrorism. Something I believe to be evil.

&gt; that's why I refuse to join the mob in venting all my anger at The Evil Jihadi John, but if it helps you sleep better, then snooze away.

I think the people hear aren't venting anger at the middle east situation on this prick, I think most people here are actually just disgusted by the whole thing. In fact most of the comments calling this evil, or disgusting or unforgivable talk about his family and how awful this must have been for them. I also don't think acknowledging the horror and evil capable of other people is going to help anyone sleep better. If anything if someone wanted to sleep better; denying it is an evil act act and pretending it's justified would work a damn sight better.

It makes no sense at all for rUK to let a new country play games with its own economy. rUK can't stop Scotland from using the pound, but it would be stupid to agree to a currency union. Especially one that effects 60million other people without their consent. It makes absolutely no economic sense to allow a currency union.

&gt; We will get our oil because it's our oil. It's in Scottish waters, there's no vagueness on that. 

Scottish waters extend 12 miles from the Scottish coast. If you think that all of the oil is within that range, you're mistaken. And that is where Westminster will spit and snarl to get a share.

""Wings Over Scotland ... advocates Scottish independence, but is not affiliated or connected in any way to the SNP, and neither gives to or receives money from the party, or indeed any other party. ""

&gt; Do you think comments like that made by the party that is the driving force behind independence go unnoticed?

How could I argue that such a comment would go unnoticed, when its all over the press? Again, the comment was made by a rather discredited individual, not by the SNP. The real question is however, what relevance comments like these have.

English culture, or the aspect of it that dominates in the media, internationally, economically and demographically (the south east), seems to have an absolute deference to authority. That means you're much more likely to believe economists and financiers. Others are more likely to be highly sceptical and critical since it's just 6 years since they crashed the global economy with impunity.

They also look at that crash and see two things:

1. The poorest were hit the hardest, and none of the 'British' parties challenged it. Labour, who should've taken that role as a nominally left wing party and main opposition, haven't just quietly acquiesced, they've stated they'll continue the coalition's austerity program as is. Finding and implementing an alternative isn't possible in the UK.

2. That being in the UK is no guarantee of financial stability either. It might be recovering quickly now, but who is benefiting from it? Not the average person. That'd be bad enough, but when taken along with the fact that the poorest are the ones who suffered the most, it's particularly egregious and looks like a massive con, a transfer of wealth upwards. Then we look back over the last 35 years and see it's a continuing theme in the UK. Who wants to be a part of that? Not a people who value what is done with the money and who benefits from it more than a simple check of how much of it there is.

English people have convinced themselves there is no alternative, partly because there isn't for them, they aren't being offered one because all of those problems are caused by the culture of the south east. England doesn't have the option to break away from the UK and all its faults, corruptions and problems because you'd just take them with you. English and British are the same thing, due to suppression in the past and due to sheer population numbers now.

Scotland has two things: the lack of a culture that would sustain/tolerate and defer to a corrupt elite transferring wealth upwards, meaning they don't share as much responsibility for the state of the UK as England. They aren't really Scotland's problems, and they have an opportunity to break from the UK.

Why couldn't Scotland do something like this? In fact, this looks like something the SNP would go for. Not that this is at all relevant.

Whilst there are certainly people saying this, these are not opinions held by the majority of the Yes campaign. Even so, if you do think they are speaking actual bollocks, then you have just somewhat admitted that your doomsday message about the post-independence state of the Scottish economy is also somewhat bollocks. 

Markets love stability, but there is absolutely no basis for assuming that there won't be any political stability going beyond the short-term. The reason why the SNP wants to stick to the pound is simply that most people in the UK get all teary-eyed when thinking of Sterling. Anyhow, a currency union would not pose any problems in the short-term. The similarities drawn to the Euro are not even reasonable. In the Euro there are many countries, none of which have absolute control. With the pound, England would be in total control of monetary policy, even if Scotland had some say in a currency union. What ever Scotland does, England can therefore enact monetary policy in its own favour, without a consideration for Scottish concerns. Game theory tells us, that this alone sets enough of a disincentive for the Scottish government to enact policies to the detriment of itself, fiscal vis-a-vis monetary policy.

If you ace all the controls and manuvers then you may feel better about jumping straight into the DAS.

If you feel like you'd like to get more practice in then get a 125.

The place I trained at had cbt+DAS package or just DAS which was minus the cost of the cbt.

Keep in mind the instructor may try and push for you to do your DAS following the cbt, they have a living to make.

But if you don't feel safe enough after the cbt then just get a 125 and get some miles in.

The problem is going to be that the best interests of the UK are different to what the public think the best interests of the UK are.

When the credit crunch happened we basically offered to bail out Ireland with a ""whatever it costs"" deal. This was used by them to negotiate from a stronger position with the Troika and it is why they've come out better than everyone else who collapsed. The reason for this is simple. Most of Ireland's trade is with the UK. It would hurt us badly if they crashed like Greece did.

Most of Scotland's trade will be with the UK. In the immediate aftermath of independence the UK will have only one policy with regards to Scotland. That is that Scotland must remain solvent and stable no matter what. If it collapses, we will hurt far more than the comparatively minor costs of stopping them from collapsing.

So the real political mess will be the public calling out for punitive action in the ""best interests of the UK"" and politicians actually trying to act in the best interests of the UK. We really aren't going to push Scotland into the nether over some petty dispute over oil or debt and Salmond knows it.

It's hard to buy such a string of improbable coincidences that the 'no monster' interpretation requires - for a start if it was a kid under the blanket (which it clearly wasn't given the height of the creature) then why didn't it act like any normal kid either when Clara emerged from under the bed or when the Doctor turned on the light switch? the kid would have jumped or atleast said something, not just wandered over to them and then run away at lightning speed.

So let's say we go down the federated path.  Pretend we have London as one.  How quickly will it vote to help other areas less?

What happens if Scotland gets to be separate from Glasgow?

As is, many people feel that places such as London unfairly get central government spending, but what would happen if they had more independence?  Think Londoners will say no, we don't want cross rail 2, we want to send money to this other federate, hah!

The [Annual Population Survey](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Labour-Market/Publications) runs up to the end of March, approximately six months ago.

&gt; One explanation is that the population figures are wrong, but another is that hundreds on the young voters‚Äô register are not entitled to vote.

Another explanation would be that some of those people have moved to the area the preceding six months, most likely school leavers who have entered the workforce. As the article itself says: ""the age group is sometimes transient"".

&gt; The Labour Party has made a formal complaint to the returning officer after No campaign canvassers in East Ayrshire found at least four children aged between three and 11 who were on the register and had received polling cards to vote. The child voters only came to light because their parents, who did not register them, alerted the No campaign.

And that is the correct response. The local returning officer is responsible for investigating if this is a simple clerical error or something more sinister (they are also responsible for [maintaining the register itself](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/160697/Scottish-Independence-referendum-franchise-guidance.pdf)).

I would lean towards this being a clerical error, as presumably all four children are from the same family. The article doesn't say either way, oddly, but it would be unusual for four unrelated families to all notify the No campaign simultaneously.

&gt; Across Scotland, there are 109,533 people on the secret young voters‚Äô register, according to figures issued on Friday.

The Electoral Commission [are quite clear](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/160697/Scottish-Independence-referendum-franchise-guidance.pdf) about why the young voter register is ""secret"":

&gt;As the information contained in the register of young voters is strictly controlled as set out above, it must be held securely by the ERO.

The Tories may now only have one parliamentary seat, but they won 16.7% of the vote in the 2010 general election, which was just 3% behind the SNP and only 2% behind the Liberal Democrats. The true difference between Scotland and England is in *electoral voting* patterns, it isn't ideological.  
  
The left in Scotland seem to be working on the assumption that the political landscape is going to magically unite and the highly prevalent conservative nationalist block is just going to go away. Which is delusional.  
  
Currently the widespread hatred of the tories is suppressing the conservative vote. What I think the the left hasn't considered, and what is going to come as a big shock is that; once the threat of the tories has been expunged there's going to be a massive resurgence in the popularity and strength of the conservative vote.

1) Our defence, minus the goal (which in fairness was just a very good cross), was absolutely brilliant. Hobbs and Mancienne are the best centre-back partnership I've seen for us for as long as I can remember. Lichaj has turned into a very solid left-wing. Jack Hunt is, in my opinion, a must buy should he continue in the same vain. Today he was absolutely non-stop running up and down that wing, but also intelligently cutting inside to offer much needed penetration. 

2) Losing Cohen early on was such a blow as he's a leader, but Tesche was a more than apt replacement. To be thrown into a game such as this one and to play that well, showed me that the German is a excellent acquisition

3) Interestingly enough, I actually feel that the break for the pitch invaders helped the game. It gave the fans a breather, and then got them fired up for the final 25 minutes

4) How Ryan Shotton has walked away from that match without a yellow card is beyond me

5) I just feel that it may be worth trying out Paterson for a run of games now over Burke. Burke didn't have a bad game today, but Paterson excites the crowd and is capable of taking on the full back. Burke does offer more defensively however so it's a toss up

6) I want to change my surname to Assombalonga

Hell, if Scotland minted their own currency, it would likely be good for the UK, as it would make Scottish products relatively cheap (due to the currency inevitably devaluing following a float).

The idea that a currency union is in the UK's economic interest is a complete fiction. If the UK government had to choose between currency union and Scotland not paying the debt... they'll probably choose to just let Scotland avoid the debt. Debt is for 30 years maximum. Currency union would mean partial control of the pound forever.

Not that this will happen. The UK has plenty of assets to negotiate with to get Scotland to take the debt. E.g. the USA owes Britain around $150 billion, and that's just one country.

And if your contention is that the involvement of these and other Scots in creating the UK's problems is that despite their Scottishness they represent ""English culture"", then that is literally committing the ""No true scotsman"" fallacy.

There are cultural forces at play here, of course, but they're nowhere near as simple as you make out. And just because people believe the stories they tell about themselves, it doesn't make them right.

The entire effort to blame non-Scots for everything that is less than perfect and simultaneously absolve Scots of all responsibility for anything negative may well be effective in winning support for independence, but it is a discredit to Scotland and does nothing to prepare people for the realities of life post-independence.

Personally I earn a moderate amount and I like to live in a reasonable sized house, so I just have to accept that I can't live in London. There are too many other people who are prepared to make sacrifices that I am not.

How would regulating prices help? You could pass a law saying that nice 4 bed apartments in central London have to be priced at ¬£300K. Suddenly I can afford one, so can a million other people.

&gt;The __heat death of the universe__ is a historically suggested [ultimate fate of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe) in which the universe has diminished to a state of no [thermodynamic free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_free_energy) and therefore can no longer sustain processes that consume energy (including [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) and [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life)). Heat death does not imply any particular [absolute temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature#Internal_energy_at_absolute_zero); it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics\)). In the language of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), this is when the universe reaches [thermodynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium) (maximum [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy)). The hypothesis of heat death stems from the ideas of [William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin), who in the 1850s took the [theory of heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_heat) as [mechanical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy) loss in [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature) (as embodied in the first two [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics)) and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale.

He was hugely influential, both in his own lifetime and after his death. He was a strong supporter of both the American and French revolutions, and his writings influenced individuals as diverse as Immanuel Kant, Thomas Malthus and Karl Marx. He's generally been forgotten these days, though Huw Edwards did manage to bring him up in his TV series on Welsh history, which I was pleased to see.

But, the referendum is not about making Scottish citizens better of the day after the vote - as if money would suddenly appear in their back pocket?? - it's about creating the environment to implement the changes for a better Scotland in the future. What I feel like we are seeing is a departure, in Scotland, from the political short-termism that our politicians are so use to, and moreover, returning to a government that invests in it's citizens and supports the infrastructure that allows society to work. 

As I see it, no one is happy with the way things are being run. The UK - and the whole world - has changed more quickly and more dramatically in recent years (decades and longer) than ever before and we're playing catch up. I think it's time to take a step aside and decide our future in a clear and open way - with proper research, economic analysis and clear mission statements for the whole political spectrum - otherwise we're going to continue to sellotape (scotch tape?) over the cracks. Personally, I don't think the referendum achieves this in the best way, but, given the apathy of our politicians, it might be the only way. 

As an Englishman, I hope Scotland does vote for independence and succeeds - to show that there is more than one way to run an country, and blow some fresh thinking south to Westminster.

1. The jobcentre is not there to help you. They are there to get you signed off, therefore do not expect any help. Jump through the hoops, apply for everything you can and never expect them to be there to help. They are parole officers to your unemployment, slip up and they will shove you back in the can with no money. 

2. It isn't you fault you can't get a job. They classic positions for the working class have been shipped out or made redundant through technology and have never been replaced. The 'job surplus' is for underpaid, overworked and unfairly treated jobs that you need to be completely retrained for.

There is no way, short of war, the rUK could successfully claim Scotland's oil. No way.  UK Government ministers have time and again admitted and conceded that the oil in Scotland's maritime area is Scotland's.

The debt, however, is inextricably tied to Sterling, and its usage in a currency union. No currency union, no debt.
The FT are trying to do a quick argument here and skip over the complexities in the hope those poor dumb Scots don't notice.  Too late.  We noticed.

In the long run, I'd imagine Scotland will float it's own currency, as despite the negotiations to the contrary in the run-up, I can't see Scotland's input to the Bank of Sterling getting heeded very much - eventually UK Govt will try to sideline and ignore Scotland in that sense, and so when the economies begin to diverge, Scotland will need more fundamental control over fiscal policy.
But for the first 5-10 years, a Sterling-zone currency union suits both states well.
And no UK Chancellor will go to the polls next year, with a threat to ""stick it to those lazy Scotch"", by offering to pay our share of the debt interest because they chopped off their nose to spite their face...

Let us know if you need any help with the application process for Bristol, I know that application season starts soon. There's one thing I can help you out with, though.

Here's a rough guide to vintage shopping in Birmingham:

[Cow](http://www.wearecow.com/) in Digbeth is probably the biggest vintage shop in Brum. It's pretty expensive for what you get, and it's a bit more trend focused than others, but they also have probably the widest selection.

Near Cow in the Custard Factory is [Flamingo](https://www.facebook.com/flamingovintagebirmingham) vintage. It has just opened, I haven't been personally but it looks pretty good. 

There are three vintage stalls in the Rag Market outside the Bullring. Fly vintage is small but really well curated, they always have a lot of good stuff for very reasonable prices. There's two other nameless stalls. One of them is right in the centre of the market. It's a big messy collection of piles of clothes with no prices on them. It's run by a pretty weird guy who you can haggle with. There's another nameless stall near Fly vintage that is mostly menswear but has a lot of really well priced vintage women's Burberry trenches, Barbour quilted jackets, etc.

In town you've got [Harper and Lewis](http://www.harperandlewisvintage.co.uk/), who have two branches. One is in the Bullring near the bull, the other one is in the Oasis market. Harper and Lewis used to be really great but in my opinion is less good since they expanded. The Oasis market location is on the top floor, it's hard to miss, it's the shop with wooden walls. There's another vintage store, solely womenswear, just below it on the middle level inside the Oasis market. There's another vintage stall that has quite a lot of knitwear in the Oasis. It's just in front of you if you enter through the entrance in the Square shopping complex.

I'm sure I've missed a couple. It's also worth checking out Kings Heath and Moseley markets. They're on about once a month. There's not always clothes there but there's always something interesting for sale. ",0,1410728019,null,0,false,0,ckia8mj,t3_2gdkm7,t1_ckia8mj,t3_2gdkm7,null,1427012943,1,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,1

If someone is ""bigoted"", sure, they often... ""commit"" (?) bigotry, but being ""bigoted"" can just mean that you are irrationally attached to your beliefs, whereas bigotry itself is usually the negative acts towards those who disagree with your beliefs.

So it is an extremely tenuous distinction, but it does hold up. Your definition of ""intolerance"" doesn't really matter here in that it can still refer to being intolerant of a person, not just being intolerant of a belief. Your own definition of bigotry was the actual intolerance towards a person, whereas of ""bigoted"" was being intolerant to someone's beliefs. There's not a great distinction, especially considering the words are so similar (but function differently, with one being a noun and the other an adjective), but they are usually used in slightly different contexts with one implying the other.

Someone could have bigoted views, but they may not actually commit bigotry itself. If they commit bigotry itself, they almost definitely do have bigoted views.

I'm also not sure if the downvotes are ironic... I mean, they're not really contrary to what would be expected, as they're usually used for things that don't add to the discussion, and in this case arguing that having a mindset against certain views isn't committing bigotry... though it may be somewhat bigoted.",0,1410728144,null,0,false,0,ckiaazm,t3_2gda8a,t1_ckiaazm,t1_cki35vv,null,1427012912,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

They seem to have a massive hard on because the Govt actually allowed the vote.

All in all, I think it would be sad to see the Union die, but I do love volatility and things need to shake up here regardless of the outcome. In theory I quite like the idea of both Scotland and Catalunia being independent. Both countries have huge potential, and with the right policies, can be massive successes.

Their movement seems to be on a much higher level of preparation, organisation and deep down desire however, while over hear it feels a bit last minute and winged. Like a Blue Peter referendum... ""An for an economic policy, here's one we made earlier (in the 70s)""

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"Please stop comparing it to Israel/Gaza, that's a 40 year old conflict with bitter and well organized people on both sides. Complaints to the BBC and other media outlets are always brigaded by some parent organization. 

Plus it's also nonsense, any formal academic study of the issue will show that there is a clear pro-Israel bias on the BBC. Any action they take is always placed in context e.g. ""Israel bombed Gaza in response to militant rockets"" while the would rarely say something like ""Hamas militants attacked IDF forces following an Israeli incursion breaking a 5-month ceasefire"". 

Read [this](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/23/bbc-israeli-conflict-coverage) and the book it refers to if you have any doubt. When it comes to foreign matters the BBC always sides with the UK foreign office. Right now they are pro-Israel so the BBC is pro-Israel. Trying to judge media bias by numbers of complaints is as useful as asking a football crowd if a play was a foul or not. 

It's worth understanding how media bias works before even beginning to complain about it. Often bias revolves around simply not reporting something at all, this is one of the BBC's favoured tactics. For example, how often do they mention that just a year ago we were funding ISIS and assisting them in obtaining arms from our regional allies? We hosted the propaganda wing, SoHR (funded by MI6), for years and everything they said, no matter how insane and unbelievable, was printed with full authority. All of this has been ""forgotten"" as they build consensus for our impending action in the region. These are largely same militants we helped in Libya, again another detail ""omitted"" from our reports. 

I could write page after page about BBC bias but one thing is new is such overt bias within UK domestic politics. This is unprecedented and it's led to vast numbers of people losing all confidence in them. The trick to propaganda is to avoid subjects that your target population already knows about. They fucked up.

Yup, when you control your own monetary policy, there is political freedom to do as you wish. 

When you do not control your own monetary policy, you do not control the force that underpins your economy.

If the Bank of England feels that it's appropriate to raise rates for the UK (ex Scotland), and it forces a wave of mortgage defaults across Scotland, and Scottish financial institutions can't access liquidity from the Bank of England, then you have the credit crunch and Eurozone crisis rolled into one. What then? The IMF? 

The fact that it's a completely plausible situation is the most terrifying thing of all. Bookies are even taking odds on a bailout timeline.

When people lose their homes, or see their business go down because banks won't lend, how much patience do you think they will have for politicians who made such a crappy economic deal, but lowered the age of consent?

When an economy crashes and monetary policy is dictated from elsewhere, cuts and reforms can be forced upon a country as seen across Europe in recent years.

If the right reforms don't follow, an unsympathetic beaurocracy can apply economic pressure on a political class to install their own candidate (Italy) until they get what they want.

If the crash is very bad, social break down can lead to extremists manipulating the situation for power and influence (Golden Dawn/Greece).

At this point, all the lovely fluffy laws are out the window. 

What you propose is all fantastic, and in a country which controls it's own monetary affairs you are correct, politics can be a separate driver of a nation from the economy.

*If* Scotland manages to agree a currency union there will be major concessions made to achieve it. Any union that is agreed upon will likely have a recurring review process, where every 5-10 years or so a decision is made on whether it is still in both countries interests.

What I personally believe will happen is that a 5-year union will be agreed with the concession being that Faslane &amp; Coolport remain open throughout that period. The MoD have already hinted that [they would back this plan](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/pro-union-campaign-in-crisis-after-minister-admits-currency-union-ban-was-a-bluff.23823233):

&gt; ""Saying no to a currency union is obviously a vital part of the no campaign. But everything would change in the negotiations if there were a yes vote.""

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; Scotland can promise that the pound will remain the currency of Scotland. It cannot promise a currency union, however. That takes two parties. Even if the government of the remaining UK is prepared to countenance such a union, there should be a referendum. The only satisfactory terms for the residual UK will be ones that impose very tight limits on the fiscal deficits Scotland can run. It must also insist that financial regulation will be run by the Bank of England, which would nonetheless remain accountable to the UK state alone.

The above section from OP's article indicates that a currency union, if it ever came to pass, would not really represent anything like independence for Scotland. 

But in any case, the argument that you link to that rUK would accept a currency union to counter financial turmoil caused by a breakup is just wrong-headed. Not because the UK wouldn't suffer such effects, but because it is bizarre to expect that rUK would react to them by getting into bed with the very people who had unleashed them in the first place by breaking up the union.

The Yes campaign is never tired of saying that the Scots can endure hard economic times for the sake of their independence; yet their belief in being granted a currency union rests on the belief that rUK wouldn't do the same. 

If the pound came under pressure because of Scottish independence, I'd expect rUK to tough it out and let Scotland enjoy their new found freedom without the benefit of a currency union.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;Your definition of ""intolerance"" doesn't really matter here in that it can still refer to being intolerant of a person, not just being intolerant of a belief.   

It does matter. The definition of ""bigotry"" that /u/alex1609 used is supported by the two definitions together. What is truly irrelevant is that ""bigotry"" can also mean other things, since I don't suppose that he was trying to use it in all senses at once - only one valid sense.

To go through Oxford's two definitions in stages:

- If ""intolerance"" can mean ""unwillingness to to accept views, beliefs, or behaviour that differ from one‚Äôs own"", then one of the valid meanings of intolerance is ""unwillingness to accept views that differ from one's own"".
- If ""bigotry"" can mean ""intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself"" then, following on from the above, one valid definition of ""bigotry"" is ""unwillingness to accept views that differ from one's own from someone who holds different opinions from oneself"".

That is the sense that he used the word in, and it's perfectly fine.

Also, sorry, but the distinction you've made between the nuances of ""bigotry"" and ""bigoted"" just doesn't exist. Referring to another very reputable dictionary, Merriam-Webster, they're simply [the characteristic acts, beliefs, or state of mind of a bigot](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigotry) and [the adjective that describes a bigot](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot) respectively. In other words, bigotry is bigoted by definition, and a bigoted act, bigoted belief, or bigoted state of mind is accurately described as bigotry.

&gt;in this case arguing that having a mindset against certain views isn't committing bigotry... though it may be somewhat bigoted.

So what UKIP are claiming is that the Labour party as a whole was responsible because of our ""love affair with immigration, political correctness and multi-culturalism"" has resulted in complaints being swept under the carpet.

Trying to make some sense this, political correctness is seen by the right as a left-wing thing, and to be fair the left tend to be a bit more politically correct than the right as a whole. It is also true the report into this incident said that a culture of political correctness within the police was partly to blame. However how does this make the Left responsible for the failings of the police? The police put in place their procedures after they were found institutionally racist for their handling of the Stephen Laurence incident and if they have gone too far the other way it‚Äôs not the Labour Party's fault.

As for his blaming immigration and multiculturalism, you find paedophilia from all groups in society and even if Muslims have a slightly more likely to be paedophiles, it‚Äôs still only a very small proportion and it seems an idiotic reason to be against immigration and multiculturalism.

Even though Costa hasn't missed any games for us through injury he clearly has had some sort of issues so I think we will play it safe and keep him fit for City. I can see Willian starting out right against City for his work rate and pace on the counter so Schurrle will get the go ahead mid-week, like-wise with Oscar. I expect both Matic and Ramires to start against City but both have the energy to play both games, Cesc on the other hand I'm not so sure about and imagine we will keep him fully fit for City. I think we will need at least one of Hazard, Cesc and Costa on the pitch which is why I included him in the team.

I think Zouma will get some games in the groups and Schalke would be the one team In our group I would normally want a strong defence for but with our defence looking shakey and Schalke being in poor form I wouldn't put it past Jose to start him but I expect Terry will start.

See, I went to the O2 shop for an upgrade in November. The phone I wanted as an upgrade was ¬£150 upfront and ¬£27 a month for a 24 month contract. I walked across the street to Phones4U and the same phone, same network, with the same contract lengths, minutes, texts and data, was ¬£22 a month with a ¬£50 upfront fee (Which the manager waived when I said I was going to shop around and think about it). For the same deal, that's a difference in overall cost of ¬£5 x 24 months + ¬£150 = ¬£270.

I'm not surprised the networks are pulling out of Phones4U, because Phones4U are happy to sacrifice their margins and undercut the networks to attract customers, which is what competition is all about. The networks don't like this, they want their own store to be the only place to get their deals so they can charge extortionate prices. If all the networks do this they can collectively keep prices high, because competition between them doesn't seem to have impacted their prices in the past.

I'm almost certain that nuance does exist. Maybe not, or maybe it's just in the usages I've seen, but if someone ""commits bigotry"" (or if the act of bigotry itself is spoken of), I usually take it to mean that they are irrationally clinging to their own beliefs and attacking someone else (their character, for example) because that person holds different views. It may be an implied attack (e.g. ""I don't think homosexuals should be allowed to get married"" would be bigoted *and* bigotry in my mind, as you're (again, in my mind) attacking the validity of their emotions and relationships), but it normally implies an attack on someone.

If something's just bigoted, it could just be an outdated view which most people consider to be... ""politically incorrect"" or simply racist, homophobic, or something else like that. The usages I've seen of ""bigotry"" normally imply a further attack on a specific person than simply talking of a person's bigoted views - bigoted views *may* also have an attack on people, but bigotry itself strongly suggests an attack (at least to me). I'm not sure if this is some random nuance I've created in my head (as I agree, Merriam-Webster is a reputable dictionary, and you'd expect the words to be used like that) but my view of the words definitely seem to line up with the definitions provided on Google. However, I'm not sure if they're sourced from a reputable dictionary, and I'm not sure if you'd consider Google to be a reputable source itself.

Here are the definitions provided by Google nonetheless:    
bigotry: ""intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself.""    
bigoted: ""having or revealing an obstinate belief in the superiority of one's own opinions and a prejudiced intolerance of the opinions of others.""

From reading these definitions, they seem to indicate a very similar thing (again, with one being a noun and the other an adjective), but it seems that bigotry is more specifically an intolerance towards a person (and here, the key part is the ""towards"", as it's not just an unwillingness to accept the views of others, but it's an unwillingness to accept foreign views, and this unwillingness is (aimed?) *towards* somebody - I think that makes a difference). Being bigoted is just the obstinate belief that your beliefs are better and others' are not.

People who do not care about the decisions they are making make bad decisions.

That's nice in sentiment, and I understand the whole idea of pooling risk and resources - but Scotland, wealthier than the UK as a whole per head, had poverty increase by 110,000 people whilst poverty in the UK as a whole went down. A further 100,000 people are set to go into poverty in Scotland in the next year under the current austerity agenda that will be imposed until at least 2018 by either a labour or tory government.

So I ask you - how on earth can we be pooling our resources fairly if the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer in the UK? Inequality has never been on a scale as large as this. Westminster is focussed on investing in london to improve the economy - and don't get me wrong, it does improve the economy - but when lots of money is invested in london, other areas of the UK miss out. Areas of the UK that have been neglected by every government since Thatcher. The governing body that decides MP's pay just approved a 9% pay rise for them - how on earth is this just and fair when more and more people in Scotland are going into poverty and being forced to rely on foodbanks? You seek to maintain the establishment despite all it does to the poor. A yes vote is the ultimate protest vote, that will harbour real change.

Pretty much, yes.

Around [90% of prescriptions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21629363) in England are dispensed for free, as most are prescribed to those who need them but can't pay for them (the very young or the very old).

England's population is around 53 million so you have around 5.3 million people making a payment, whereas Scotland has around 5 million people so there'd only be about 500K people paying.

For a smaller population you're probably better off simply making them free for everyone. The money generated is unlikely to cover the cost of means testing, or the impact on the economy from people trying to tough it out through simple illnesses that could be addressed by prescription.

true,NFB42,smith,Smith,"One thing that I remember from behind the scenes bits of earlier seasons:

In a new Doctor's first season, the guest writers don't really get much to go on when writing for the new Doctor. From the second season onwards the writers will have been able to see the new Doctor in action for a season. But as it's the first one, a lot of the scripts will have originally been written for Matt Smith and reworked, or else written for a generic 'Doctor' so Capaldi could fill in the blanks.

Obviously this can't explain everything, like why you also dislike Moffat's scripts. But imo if you think Listen was boring I don't really know what you're on about any ways :P. I could understand people having their dislikes of the episodes so far, but I don't see how anyone could ever consider the current series worse than series 7. Not that I think series 7 was that bad, but rather that I don't see how the last few episodes have somehow been a radical shift in writing quality from the standard we've been getting since Moffat took the helm.

(And personally I feel if you compare the current first four to Smith's first four, the average quality is higher now. *The 11th Hour* was a masterpiece, but imo *Into the Dalek* &gt; *Victory of the Daleks*, *Robots of Sherwood* &gt; *The Beast Below* and *Listen* &gt; *The Time of Angels*.

There are loads of issues the uk needs to work on, but going independent wont solve any, it will bread and magnify them, the country will already start out divided. And as the reality sinks in, you will very much be feeling alone.

I'm okay with any age group, however I'm not single myself so it can get a tad awkward, particularly as people sometimes assume you are. I'm female and my favourite groups happen to be pretty much all women anyway, so I generally don't come across people who are just going along to events to pick up.

If you're looking to join a group of people who are highly skilled at a particular activity, then yes, there are much better options. It sounds like you're definitely more into the activity itself than increasing your social circle. Maybe OP would be ok with more the 'more cake &amp; less activity' type events.

A no vote is not a vote for devo max, or federalism. The powers promised are vague promises of income tax powers - but only the power to raise them. Or at least those are labour's promises - the three parties can't agree on anything between them, so this weird offer of devo-lite is not all that appealing. It might even make things worse, with the possibility of the Barnett formula being scrapped, causing a ¬£4 billion cut to the Scottish government's budget - since they wouldn't get the revenues from corporation tax, nor the oil revenues.

With a no vote, at the current rate of devolution, we might end up with devo max in 10-20 years time, and for federalism to happen there needs to be a demand for it in England - of which there is none. So that probably won't happen for another 50+ years time, if ever.

Scotland needs these powers *now*. Not in 10 years time, certainly not 50 years time. 110,000 people were thrown into poverty in Scotland in the last year, whilst poverty in the UK as a whole went down. 100,000 more are due to move below the poverty line in the next year under the current tory government's austerity agenda due to continue until *at least* 2018, and which labour have promised to continue if they get elected.

So yes, devo max or federalism would be preferable. But they are not on the table, nor will they be for a long time, no matter how much the Westminster parties want to make it seem they are.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Now it's either conservative or labour to save us from UKIP and they're both going to screw us just as badly.

I'd suggest that as a young person you should vote UKIP and not necessarily because you agree with any of their policies.

In the next election the Liberal Democrats are going to lose a significant percentage of their seats.  This is good.  They misrepresented themselves to garner votes and that has to be punished.  *(This is about the point where a Lib Dem apologist comes in and starts with, ""Tuition fees were never a priority issue!""  Well, true.  But you only got a load of votes by pretending it was.)*  After this well deserved kick in the pants the Lib Dems can decide how to go about reforming themselves and their credibility.

Two things are needed:  First, a high enough turnout among young voters that that demographic is relevant to politicians.  Second, a direct reminder to the Conservatives and to Labour that they aren't entitled to people's votes by default. 

So, why UKIP?  Why not the Green party of a local independent?  Which ever way you vote UKIP aren't going to form a government.  However *(and this is where they distinguish themselves from the Green party or an independent)* UKIP are scary to both the Conservative party and to Labour.  They're gnawing at the edges of the support base for both parties.  *(Euroskepticism has been the remit of the Conservatives for a long time and issue of neglecting the concerns of the working class sucks support from Labour.)*

As such, UKIP, unlike the Green party or an independent are a viable mechanism for influencing the major parties.

It's a fair criticism to point out that UKIP don't better represent the working classes and that they don't have viable policies, but it doesn't matter since they won't be forming a government.

To be fair, there is an issue you should give consideration to in respect of how vote splitting can lead to your least favoured party winning.  This is where you have, say, potential Conservative voters voting UKIP in large enough numbers that Labour wins.  This is an issue to consider and make your own mind up over.",0,1410734688,null,0,false,0,ckidnot,t3_2gdr4x,t1_ckidnot,t1_cki5qt9,null,1427011348,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Sterlingisation (Scotland using the pound without a currency union) is actually not a problem for the rUK, any more than it was when Ireland pegged the Irish pound to sterling.

Now, we get some scenes about Clara and Danny, but it only seeks to do very little. We've already had some of the set-up in *Into the Dalek*, and we'll get more of the pay-off later.

&gt; England's population is around 53 million so you have around 5.3 million people making a payment, whereas Scotland has around 5 million people so there'd only be about 50K people paying.
&gt; For a smaller population you're probably better off simply making them free for everyone. The money generated is unlikely to cover the cost of means testing, or the impact on the economy from people trying to tough it out through simple illnesses that could be addressed by prescription.

This is what /u/mojojo42 wrote above. Sorry to burst your irrelevant London bashing bubble. 

Of course I'm going to pretend you're aware that prescription payments are capped to only about ¬£8 in England with further caps (at 4 items and 12 items) to prevent multiple prescriptions adding up and are totally free for the young, the old, those on JSA, those on Employment and Support Allowance, those on Income Support, those on universal credit, NHS inpatients, those with war pensions, the pregnant, the recently pregnant, the disabled, those with a specific medical exemptions and all cancer patients.

What I will say is that it is also perfectly acceptable to treat ""bigoted"" and ""bigotry"" as two plain and generic derivatives of the word ""bigot"". Evidently enough people do that for it to have appeared in Merriam-Webster.

I think focusing on ""towards"" is a bit of a red herring. That appears after ""intolerance"" because it's appropriate in that construction, whereas it doesn't make grammatical sense to transpose it directly after ""unwillingness"". If you like, you can read it as ""directed towards"" or ""with respect to"", giving you:

&gt;bigotry: unwillingness to accept views that differ from one's own, directed towards someone who holds different opinions from oneself  

There's a bit of redundancy there but you get the idea.

For what it's worth, I don't think that the meaning of ""accept"" here is supposed to be ""agree with"" or ""endorse"", or ""bigotry"" would come to mean ""disagreement"", which it obviously doesn't. However, if you read ""accept"" as meaning ""entertain"" or ""tolerate the existence of"", then the definition makes much more sense and still fits /u/alex1609's usage.

The irony thing was a bit flippant, but I was really just saying that they were displaying an intolerance of differing viewpoints by failing to observe reddiquette.

There is nothing at all I liked about Deep Breath.

Into the Dalek had a good concept, it just didn't thrill me.  And 8 seasons in, I think the Daleks are seriously overused at this point.

Robots of Sherwood I enjoyed.  I think it's probably the best of this season for me.

You can site GDP calculations based on current UK backed security of a union, and claim come independence this remains unchanged.

Once independence occurs The scottish GDP goes tumbling, since it no longer achieves preferential treatment for contracts and must compete like all other nations. Also major industries will move south looking for security.

Likewise it will have huge costs to set up its own independent infrastructure and ministries etc.

But even ignoring all that, if a lottery winner declares himself independent in his house he becomes ""the richest nation"" , it means nothing,  its just a factor of your minuscule population, not your amazing success.

Mr lottery winner might be ""the richest nation on earth"" (if he was independent) but his buying power, and economic and political muscle are nothing, On the world stage.

It means nothing ""richest country"" in this context is like ""fastest growing"" its just used to imply success when in actual fact its just a reflection of a small population.

I like the idea of preventative medicine.    I can still choose a deluxe insurance policy if I wish.  US companies could still come and compete with UK and EU insurers.  The NHS would just be protected in putting the patient first, not the shareholder.  The private providers, as is the case now, would just have to provide that much better level of service and keep the cost justifiable over the NHS's free at the point of use.

...and the NHS isn't about *just* being cost effective.  It's about the level of care too where cost, whilst important, is secondary to principle.  At some point it says this is the bar, and no lower.  It's not cost effective to put a new hip in an octogenarian, for example.   It's not cost effective to give someone in labour an epidural just because they're in pain.  The NHS has already gone down this route to some extent.  It wasn't cost effective to have fully trained nurses responsible for cleaning wards.  Far more cost-effective to bring contractors in.  It was damn important for the wards however and standards began to slip - and then when contracts had been awarded lo and behold detergents started coming from the lowest bidder.  Standards sometimes trump cost-effectiveness assessments.

Fortunately we don't have to go down the rabbit hole of conjecture because a couple of EU countries have kindly decided to jump down before us to test the landing.  Both Denmark and Germany have opened up their healthcare models to increase market liberalisation.  Denmark's a mess and Germany is seeing not only the price of medicine going through the roof but also the lengths of recuperation stays shortened as the cost of pharmaceuticals is passed on from the insurer, who then put pressure on shorter and shorter stays.

The NHS isn't a freemarket model.      
Having the NHS does however make elected private healthcare cheaper.
 
So it's a very good idea, whether you like your private healthcare or love the NHS, to actually ring fence the NHS from outside competition.  It sets the bar.",0,1410737208,null,0,1410737548,0,ckiexe9,t3_2gec8a,t1_ckiexe9,t1_ckidvbr,null,1427010756,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

It sounds like you think something might change how much money the UK is obliged to pay to existing Gilts holders. Is that what you are saying. If so, can you explain.

Alternatively, perhaps you are saying that you think new borrowing will be more expensive for the UK. Again, can you explain the mechanism you have in mind.

When the actual bill of all these things is placed on your shoulders you will see exactly why extrapolating how things are now into an independent scotland is invalid.

There is no question independence means less security, less security means less investment, its a fools errand to think otherwise. 

Even things like huge multimillion pound ship contracts from the uk government wont be given preferential treatment, makes more sense to spend it within the union than outside.

true,mathcampbell,cnty-scotland,SNP Cllr for Inverclyde North,"We have two models here - the 'Soviet' model, or the 'Czech' model - 
Based on the Soviet model, Russia was the only successor state - assumed all responsibilities for debt etc. but kept all non-geographic assets - although in some cases embassy premises were granted (e.g Russia kept the main embassy, but other ex-soviet nations might have been given some consular adjoining properties - in many countries the former Soviet Chief of Mission house is the new Ukraine embassy etc.).  Also assumes all responsibilities under Successor state theory - it is the principal successor, takes the UN seat, new treaties are required for the new states etc.
This is roughly cognate with what Westminster is proposing - it doesn't want to share the Pound (i.e. a currency Union, the Bank of Sterling, or Bank of England as it's known), therefore we won't be sharing the debt, it will keep UK overseas assets like embassies etc. we won't receive a partial share unless negotiated etc., it wants to keep the Security Council seat, it wants to be considered the Successor state for the EU (although of course it's own EU membership will need renegotiated since it can't keep the same rebate, MEP allowance etc.).

We'd much prefer the more modern European model whereby we share things alike, as in Czechoslovakia.  Everything was shared according to proportional share - currency, debt, overseas assets, embassies etc.  Treaties entered into are re-negotiated for both new States, with such amendments as to make both liable etc.

What's clear though to anyone not in the thrall of Westminster and their media minions is that you cannot expect both.  London cannot expect (and if it does will be sorely mistaken) Scotland to assume a share of the debt, but London gives up nothing, keep all rights under Successor state, not share currency, not share non-georgraphic assets like overseas locations, commonly held territories etc.

One or either.  London can't have it both ways - we won't accept it, and if they want favourable terms for things like Trident, they need to play a fair game.  We're not being ornery, and we're not asking for unfair terms - just a rightful share of commonly held assets, and we'll honour our responsibilities....",0,1410738744,null,0,false,0,ckifo7e,t3_2gda8a,t1_ckifo7e,t1_ckib5rq,null,1427010397,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It is in iScotland's interests to pay a share of the debt because a successful rUK is in the interests of iScotland - just as a successful Scotland is in the interests of rUK. rUK is Scotland's biggest export market, and Scotland is rUK's second biggest export market after the US.

What I learned about law of contracts is what makes a contract.  It is a bit of a rabbit hole to be honest and is best looked into in an individual basis.  Otherwise, just getting the info third hand from me wont instill the confidence required to act righteously about how you enter into contract with them.  

Meeting of minds, equal consideration, two party signatures, some other stuff.  Government assume you have contracted.  That's how they justify shafting you.  Even though there is no bilateral contract between two men.  It's a man begging a corporation.  A dead entity.  They assume you have implicitly contracted because you have signed one small form with reams of legislation and small print attached to it on the statute rolls.

How I changed the agreement was it came to a six week or twelve week review of the agreement or something and they took it out, scribbled on it and started a new one.  I just calmly said what I was reasonably willing to do to find work.  This meant taking off a lot of the crap they wrote on it the first time.  Stupid shit like reading 5 papers a week, visiting anywhere under obligation, applying for jobs in a different city, whatever.  Flying carrier pigeons with your C.V. attached in morse code.

You make an assumption with no evidence to back it up and lots of evidence to deny it.

See ^^ for that point.

We would be nowhere near as ""fucked"" as Scotland would be, trade with Scotland makes up 10% of the UK's trade, we trade more with the USA and EU than we do with Scotland, by far. Whereas Scotland's trade with the UK makes up 50-70% of Scotland's non oil trade.

In all honesty, you're at least three months late in asking. But keep in mind that there's one Matt Smith (or fill in the celebrity here) and thousands and thousands of fans with requests, so these things generally don't happen.

But, if you want to give it a shot, find out who his agent or personal manager is and give them a call. It can't hurt to ask, although it will help to use the ""she had tickets but he cancelled"" angle.

Good luck.

Most of the staff could still remember the days back before they had computers and everyone used to smoke at their desks. As such, they were really obsessed with getting every benefit claim right down to the last penny. No exceptions. 

I remember spending six hours calculating the correct payment on a really complicated case once. I left it on my supervisor's desk and went home. Glad to see the back of it. The next day I com in and the case is back on my desk with a little  note. ""2p out. Do it again."" 

A few years later the Labour government closed down all the local offices and started to shunt us off to huge benefit processing centers that were little more than call centers. That is when I saw the big culture change. 

People were hired 'off the street' and given a tiny fraction of the training we had. Mistakes were abundant. I transferred over about a year after it had opened and was amazed at how many over or underpayments I came across. But nobody seemed to care. I used to get shouted at for being a few pennies over or under but here I saw many cases that were out by thousands. 

I worked on one case that was difficult and I thought my calculations might have been a  bit out so I went and found my old supervisor to ask for advice, the one that had left that note all those years back. He looked at me and said ""Just pay it. Pay them a little extra if you think you are out so they don't complain. Nobody cares here any more. They only care about how many cases you process. It's all about the stats.  They can't let this place be seen to fail. It's all political."" 

And that was that. 

In such a short time I saw the culture going from one where accuracy was the main priority to one where stats and volume were the main concern. 

In the old system we would look at benefit claims and respond to letters in the order they came in. Nobody skipped the queue unless it was an emergency. 

But in the new system we quickly learned to keep all the easy claims and letters to one side until the end of the month so we could pull them out and quickly process them to buff up our numbers. I had a new supervisor who encouraged this. Unlike my old supervisor she had transferred from some Internet call center and didn't have a clue how to do my job, she was just there to hand out memos, collect stats and arrange holiday leave. 

I stuck it out for maybe another six months after six years on the job. I had stopped taking any pride in my work and could see the same attitude in all the older people. 

So one day I walked in Monday morning and just quit. I jumped on a plane flew to another country and didn't go back. 

Best thing I ever did.

true,SnoopyLupus,null,null,"&gt; We have two models here - the 'Soviet' model, or the 'Czech' model 

Neither of which have any relevance to a country leaving the UK, which has no modern precedent. No country has left the UK in the last few decades, so it's uncharted waters. Russian legality is a totally separate issue. UK law is all that matters here.

&gt;  it doesn't want to share the Pound (i.e. a currency Union, the Bank of Sterling, or Bank of England as it's known), therefore we won't be sharing the debt

This is where you're not understanding the issue. You are leaving the UK, so leaving influence on its currency. That's your choice. This has nothing to do with the debt. You will still owe the debt that paid for all the infrastructure and services you've enjoyed.

&gt; One or either. London can't have it both ways - we won't accept it

I accept that Salmond is willing to start Scotland off with basically an extortion racket, a country whose economy is built on defaulting on debt, but the rest of us don't have to accept that. What the Scots (assuming they think like you) wish to steal is irrelevant. They won't be allowed to, and there's no reason to allow them to steal from the rest of us. And defaulting on a debt is stealing.

It honestly doesn't matter one jot what you will accept. Your acceptable level of thievery and extortion won't override our need to be fair to both sides, and the UK is in control. Scotland is just lucky  that we're willing to play fair.

&gt;just a rightful share of commonly held assets

You will be getting that. The roads, schools, housing, everything. And the debt that paid for them. The currency is a totally separate issue, and isn't something that caused the debt, and holding it for ransom obviously isn't going to be acceptable. We can wait for a government that has an adult view of the situation. Salmond is saying he won't be that, but I suspect he will back down in order to be still in power when the switchover happens. Otherwise it's going to be many years before independence actually happens, and it will happen without him.

Assuming a yes vote, of course, which I suspect is going to happen.

If I was Scottish, I'd actually probably be a yes voter. I'm not a fan of centralisation, and do believe Scotland splitting off is a better way to achieve governmental fairness for both sides. But I would not have my head in the sand about the fact that we would assume our share of debt and will lose any say in the Bank of England. That is definitely going to happen. And that's not necessarily such a bad thing. Other countries manage without their own currency, and it'd only be until you either adopt the Euro, or get your own currency. Scots should be thinking long term. Short term, it'll be hard for them. The next ten or twenty years won't be fun, economically. But in 50 years, 100 years? Probably a successful small country.

true,Aitrus233,mcgann,McGann,"Sort of. I also got the sense that in writing the Eleventh Doctor more for children than Eccleston and Tennant were, the kind of hero he would be also changed. With Eccleston and Tennant the flaws of not being able to save everyone or do everything is done as an interesting character trait, because those Doctors were aimed at the late teens and onward. They were the ""boyfriend"" Doctors. The edgier ones for lack of a better term, meant to feel more relatable in their personal struggles as well as their interests (Tennant loved Earth pop-culture). They're like Marvel Comics, heroes to relate to.

Eleven was meant to go back to being the hero of kids, like the show started out as. So that inability to change fixed events and save everyone even when impossible (i.e. Gallifrey and Trenzalore) gets addressed, because this Doctor is the Doctor that does the impossible. Like a fairy tale character who protects the children, who always wins and will save the day. He's DC Comics, a hero to look up to. And of course that's how Amy Pond saw him. An imaginary friend. Although in the eyes of his greatest enemies, he's a different kind of imaginary being: a monster, a bogeyman, a demon. Like the book I Am Legend to a degree.

And the darker side of the Doctor and his shortcomings are not ignored in Eleven's run, but they don't come to define him as much. He is instead defined as the Doctor who can save almost anyone. Who can do the impossible. He's not being a warrior or a hero, he's being a Doctor, to paraphrase the 50th.

So I see it less as ""I'm having fun"", but more ""No more. I'm tired of the rules stopping me from saving people.""

""Sorry? What did you say? Did you mention the rules? Now, listen, bit of advice. Tell me the truth if you know it. Lay down the law if you're feeling brave. But Daleks never, ever tell me the rules!""

EDIT: Tangentially related, but I also noticed how Ten and Eleven's regenerations are somewhat the opposite of each other. Ten desperately ran from the prophecy that ""he will knock four times"", and in the end it caught up with him, and he didn't want to go. And his companion Wilf is partly responsible for his demise, albeit unintentionally.

Eleven didn't willingly want to die on Trenzalore to begin with, but when he saw what was at stake (Gallifrey and the lives of everyone in the town) he decided to stay. He stayed for 900 years and accepted that he will probably die, because he already saw his grave. And then his companion Clara found a way to save him, by appealing to the Time Lords.

One ran from death and died in fear. The other made peace with death, and death was conquered. One sacrificed his life for his companion, the other was saved by his companion. (And Clara almost sacrificed her life by throwing herself into the Doctor's time stream.) And that's his reward for a lifetime of saving people. Someone finally saves him.",0,1410740525,null,0,1410754206,0,ckiggp8,t3_2gd1m7,t1_ckiggp8,t1_ckievun,null,1427010028,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Her university has made her feel like she has to get a masters (at least) to be able to find work in the industry so she's looking into that, but she'd much rather go into a job/grad scheme if anyone accepts people prior to Masters.

Her University has a focus on agricultural biotech but she's done a 3 month internship in immunology and various work experience giving her experience with varied molecular biology tools and labs and has a keen interest in genetics.

In **[2010 the Green party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales_election_results#2010_General_Election_results.5B1.5D)** ran over 301 candidates and got one MP out of it.  They lost their deposits in all but six cases.  Their total voter share was a little over 265k, which was a touch under 1%.

If we had proportional representation that would have earned the Green party three, maybe four MPs.  More, in fact, because if we had proportional representation people wouldn't regard a vote for a non main party as a wasted vote.

In the **[same election UKIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party#2010_general_election)** ran 572 candidates, though they didn't get any MPs.  They won 920k votes, which is 3.1% of the total vote.  

The same issues stand with the lack of proportional representation which would have turned out nine, maybe ten MPs.

Give or take loose change this is twice as many MPs for three times as many votes.  Averaged out each Green candidate scored 855 votes - Each UKIP candidate scored 1,607.

Since 2010 we've had the EU elections where UKIP wiped the floor with all the other parties.  But, specifically concerning UKIP:Green, UKIP pulled in 26.6% of the votes while the Greens got 7.63%.  *(And to get that 7.63% you have to pool English, Scottish and Irish Green party votes.)*

My political views are pro-EU and somewhere to the left of Labour.  If you're feeling particularly bored feel free to rummage through my post history to confirm this.  I commented specifically in the first post that there was a reason I suggested UKIP rather than the Green party or an independent.  I'm pretty sure that UKIP are in a better position to influence the behaviour of the main parties.

Just like how the royal mail can deliver a letter from southampton to scotland for the same fee as southampton to bournemouth under a union, because the less expensive (cost) deliveries of population dense areas subsidises the more remote expensive deliveries.

 Im sure you will sleep soundly knowing that by leaving the union the real cost of goods and services in scotland will be met by the scottish people only. Meaning that food and utilities will all rise in scotland and decrease in the UK, since all subsidise will end and consumers will no longer be supporting a union flat price structure, that spreads the cost of doing business over the union, not only that but the extra administration of a border will increase prices anyway.

Must be nice to know you are doing your bit to ensure poor scottish families will see prices rise at the same time as falling income, sleep well.

Sorry, I should have been clearer. When I say ""remove the white of the Saltire"" I don't mean remove *all* of the white from the Union Jack. At the moment, the red of St. Patrick's Saltire only extends half way across the diagonals on the Union Jack, [as you can see here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/1280px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png). I propose removing the white band that forms the other half of the diagonals, thereby centering the cross, but leaving a white border around it so as to complement the cross of St. George (Patrick's Saltire is a red cross on a white background too so it also works from that point of view). Here's a quick mock-up of what I mean:

Watch it again, Sigurddosn is guarding Costa, Costa initiates it first with a shove to get Sigurddson away, which is aggressive but fine as far as the rules go. Sigurddson tries to bleakly push back but hardly does anything to Costa and then half a second later Costa comes out of nowhere with his hands at Siggurdson's neck level and throwing him to the floor, *that* action is what leads to a card. You can never do that, whether you are Chelsea player, Swansea player, anyone. If players where legally allowed to use both their hands and shove people down like that than we would be seeing more rugby style plays in matches.

true,crm14250,null,null,"Sounds pretty interesting, and it looks like you put a lot of thought into it!  I have to say, the UNIT idea seems a lot cooler than the DW one.  For your DW story idea, it sounds like it's basically the show, but fanfiction. No offense, but if I want straight forward DW, I'd just watch the show. As long as it's well written, I might enjoy it, but my advice would be for you to make it as different as possible from what we've been watching.

The UNIT idea seems far cooler, and I think you could use it as a good excuse to build some lore, and fill in a lot of the gaps that the show leaves behind.  Still, it might be hard to draw people in if you're only using original characters. Using Kate, Osgood, and the other guy from the 50th whose name I forget were all in it, that'd probably help.  

With both of these, I'd say to try and make it as unlike a TV show as possible.  Take advantage of the fact that you can do literally anything you want without fear of budget, copyright, time constraints, etc. When I read fanfiction, I want something I know I'll never see on screen.  Take risks, don't be afraid to make it weird, and don't think you necessarily need to keep to an episodic structure. It's fanfiction! It can be however long you want it to be. Small one-shots are cool once in a while, and if a story needs more space, just keep writing, don't worry about length.

Also, I wouldn't expect this story to do amazingly as far as readership is concerned. It's not that I doubt you'll do a good job, but the overwhelming preference in fanfiction seems to be romance, particularly of the Doctor/Rose variety in the DW fandom. Even then, I think most people like reading about characters they know more than focusing on original ones. Even if you do this really well, I doubt you'll pull as many people as the angsty-teenage-love type stories, but the people who do end up reading it will probably really enjoy it. Basically, don't be overly concerned with view count as long as your readers are enjoying the story.  

Anyway, that's my rambling input. If you end up posting either of these, I'd definitely check it out. It really sounds like you could be onto something, so if you could give me a heads up, that'd be much appreciated!

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"The main thing, the most important thing, is to get younger people engaged in the electoral process.  They're neglected, ignored and generally treated like shit by politicians because they're not a part of the electorate.  Problem is, it's hard to be actively engaged with a process where most of us are voting for the least worst option.

Even voting BNP would be better than not voting at all.  The neglect of young voters will end only when political analysts see that they can't afford to neglect them.

*(I'm not a part of that demographic group, but I'm not much of a fan of, ""Well, I'm ok, screw you!"")*

&gt;As someone who would identify as center-left (I figure that's what you mean by left of labour?) why wouldn't you be advocating in your first post for a Green/Indie vote? Sure they have more political torque, but I advocate voting for what you believe in.

My political position is fairly close to pre-Blair Labour.  

I believe that essential services *(trains, the NHS, that sort of stuff )* should be operated by the state and that in many core industries *(banking, gas, electricity, etc)* there should be at least one state company.  *(The second part would act as a buffer against the sort of cartel behaviour you see in banking and utilities.)*  I believe that the human rights of millions shouldn't be torn up because a tiny number of cases spit out unpalatable results and that as a society we should take care of the people who most need it.  I also believe that the state has a responsibility to support near full employment.

I appreciate that most of these arguments have been lost in the public eye.

Taking my particular views as an example:  My closest political match by a pretty wide margin is Labour.  But the position of Labour has become that they're essentially entitled to my vote.  Or at the absolute least I won't vote Conservative.    After all, I'm hardly going to vote for the Bedroom Tax party, am I?  So they can neglect to attend to my interests.

If my views were diametrically opposed to this I'd potentially have the same issue.  As of 1997 the only political game was to appease the centre 

&gt;This tactical voting crap hurts my head and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But I guess it must be done though in our crappy, medieval democratic system.

If we had proportional representation I would absolutely support the idea that people should vote for what suits their views best.  I wouldn't agree with most of them, but at least the result would match the views of the electorate.

In the nineteen eighties Anatol Rappoport proposed an algorithm for playing games of the **[Prisoner's Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma)** called Tit for Tat.  It was essentially to cooperate unless the other player screws you over.  You then retaliate until they resume cooperation.  Cooperation resumes until they they stop cooperation.

I think this is a good model for dealing with the behaviour of political parties.  It's why I was pleased to see the Liberal Democrats crushed at the EU elections and expect to see the same at the next general election.  This isn't because I want to see them wiped off the political map.  Quite the contrary - I want to see them learn to properly represent the people who elect them.  

The flaw in this is that we only get to elect a government every five years.  I still think that it would be better to throw an election and force your party to learn to better represent its electors than to allow them to neglect their core voters.

This is largely why I think that UKIP are a good form of leverage.  They're hitting both of the main parties.  If there was a Workers' Party in the vein of what Labour was set up to be they would only pull votes from Labour.  This wouldn't provoke change in the Conservatives.  

If there was both an Old Labour and an Old Conservative party both main parties would be influenced.  UKIP acts *(after a fashion in a purely numerical sense)* like both.  Because it pulls from both ends the amount of influence it has is twice what either of my hypothetical parties would.

UKIP have exactly what you describe as more political torque.",0,1410748523,null,0,false,0,ckik49d,t3_2gdr4x,t1_ckik49d,t1_ckii9vj,null,1427008323,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

And you failed.

Just viewed in the context of itself, the episode is miserable: You've got Clara demonstrating Sculley-like irrational pseudo-skepticism (""it doesn't matter how much evidence I see, I will refuse to believe it's real""). And apparently we're supposed to join in that pseudo-skepticism at the end of the episode despite seeing the alien under the blanket; despite hearing the knocking on the door; despite seeing the chalk stolen and the message written; despite the cloister bells sounding and something trying to penetrate the TARDIS doors.

Viewed in the larger context of his work, however, ""Listen"" only confirms that Moffat has completely run out of ideas as a writer of Doctor Who: We get a plethora of variations on the ""don't blink"" speech. We get an inferior, rehashed version of the Silence (a.k.a. the Perfect Hider). We get a rehash of young River in the orphanage. We get a rehash of the Impossible Girl Visits the Doctor. We get a rehash of the time traveler from ""Hide"". We get a rehash of ""Midnight"". Rehash. Rehash. Rehash. Oh! And a mysterious figure in a space suit! Good lord, Moffat. I never would have expected to see such a thing from you!

And then we look at his most immediate goal: ""I'm going to do a chamber piece."" He completely failed to realize his primary goal. This wasn't a chamber piece by any definition of the word.

No way Schurrle starts after his weekend performance. I hope Remy starts but i think Costa will. Hoping Luis gets his shot along with the youngster, Cech. Really want a clean sheet and to know that we can win games without Costa starting. 

Hazard will shine with either 2 assists or 2 goals or one each. I'm excited, fucking love the CL.",0,1410752076,null,0,1410752414,0,ckilq7s,t3_2gefct,t1_ckilq7s,t3_2gefct,null,1427007572,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"This more than anything. 

The attack's starting to settle, but the weaknesses from last season-we still leak goals, we have a lot of center mids but sometimes they don't compliment each other or they have the same skillsets (Dembele-Paulinho, Stambouli-Capoue maybe, etc) are still there. On top of that, our attack isn't fully fit either yet. Ade's still making a comeback from malaria from the look of it on Saturday and Soldado's injured. 

Give it at least ten games. I think that's a good gauge of where we are and where we'll be going this season. 

On the topic of the question, they really are attacking mids and there's no amount of mental gymnastics to convince me that Lamela's a ""true winger"" in the vain of Townsend or Lennon. It's good that we've got Chadli, and in January, probably J-Rod on the cheap, to offset that. We'll basically be playing with two attacking mids and an inside forward as part of our front three, so Lamela and Eriksen will always have plenty of service to provide.

true,teamyoshi,null,null,"As far as I am aware, the line where the North ends is where people stop compressing ""the"" into "" t' "". In the West of England this border would in my estimation be on a broadly east-west line probably somewhere between Stoke and Stafford (certainly no further south than Stafford). It gets more complicated as you go further east, as the line could arguably need to dip slightly to the south in order to incorporate Derby into the North. I have limited experience regarding Nottingham, so would tentatively pencil the border in North of them putting them in the Midlands pending further research.

East of Nottingham it gets complicated, as I would consider Grantham and Lincoln to be neither North or Midlands, so the Northern border would need to turn north, incorparating Mansfield, Worksop and Scunthorpe before hitting the East coast somewhere south of Grimsby. Again this could potentially be adjusted slightly to the South if necessary, as my expertise in this area is limited.

As for the borders between the Midlands, East Anglia and the South, while I am less of an expert in these areas I would argue that the border between the South and the Midlands starts in the West somewhere in the hills between Shrewsbury and Ludlow, snaking just south of Kidderminster, Redditch, Coventry and Rugby. Somewhere between Rugby and Kettering (or possibly even slightly to the East) it turns North encompassing Leicester and Loughborough. The border between East Anglia and the South is probably somewhere just South of Ipswich on the East Coast and would I suspect inititially run slightly to the north, just to the South of Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and Huntingdon, meeting the Midlands in the Area around Kettering.

Salmolnd would clearly prefer a currency Union, but there is no way in hell that he would give away the North sea to get it.

The only scenario in which Scotland might turn off the pipes is if (as seems to be suggested above) Cameron were to unilaterally claim the EEA's that are currently considered Scottish (a line that was incidentally drawn by Westminster). I would argue that if Cameron were to be stupid enough to try this he could expect somewhere in the region of no support from either the EU or NATO at large, and that it could be easily portrayed by Salmond as brazen attempted by a larger nation to rob/rape a small defenceless nation (and fellow EU and NATO member) of it's resources with no conceivable geographic justification, ultimately little better than Saddam's invasion of Kuwait. Because that is what it would be. 

If, and only if, the universal international condemnation wouldn't be enough to change Cameron's mind, then the mere threat of turning the taps off and tanking the UK economy would probably suffice. I suspect that this would be the latest point at which the US would intervene (as per the Suez crisis) to pull the rug from under rUK. It is only in the unbelievably, ludicrously unlikely event that that failed that the taps might conceivably be messed with.

&gt;

&gt;__Theo James Walcott__ (born 16 March 1989) is an English [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays as a [forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)) for [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) and the [England national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team). Walcott won the [BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Young_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year_Award) in 2006.

&gt;Walcott is a product of the [Southampton Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C._Academy) and started his career with [Southampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C) before joining [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) for ¬£5 million in 2006. His speedy pace and ball crossing led his manager [Ars√®ne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger) to deploy him on the [wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)#Winger) for most of his career. In the 2012-13 season, a contract dispute led him to being played as a [striker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)), before returning in the 2013-14 season playing on the wing once again. 

&gt;On 30 May 2006, Walcott became England's youngest ever senior football player aged 17 years and 75 days.  On 6 September 2008, he made his first competitive start in a [World Cup qualifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA\)) against [Andorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra_national_football_team), and in the following match against [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team) on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a [hat-trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick) for England. He has represented [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team) at the [2006 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup) and [Euro 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro) and has 36 [caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport\)), scoring five goals.

You can't renege on something that you never agreed to.

if you want to continue this, I suggest you get a map of the boundaries between England and Scotland, and explain to me how Cameron (or anybody) could possibly justify on any conceivable geographic or moral grounds the unilateral expropriation of the areas currently considered to be Scottish by the Westminster government *who drew the border in question themselves in as generous a manner to England as could possibly be justified*, and have as of now, less than 100 hours before the polls open in a crucial referendum given *no indication whatsoever* that they have any problem with a border that (I repeat for emphasis) *they drew themselves*.

Perhaps you also know of some international precedent which could serve as guide in these matters? Did I miss out the UK keeping the natural resources of any of its colonies?

I used the example of Kuwait very deliberately because it was a case of theft of the resources of a small defenceless country by a larger more powerful neighbour. The vast majority of the Oil and gas is clearly off Scotland's coast. It is in the clearest possible moral sense Scotland's oil, and given that, unless you can find a justification beyond simple force majeure for an English claim, then it is perfectly reasonable to view the persuance of such a claim as attempted theft, and any successful attempt to enforce such a claim *as actual theft*.

[Here](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Img/218570/0063998.jpg) is the map of the current boundaries as decided by Westminster based on the most generous possible interpretation of International Law that they could muster. I eagerly await your attempt to justify the area between the red and black lines as belonging to either England, Wales or Northern Ireland...

I.e. we've got some issues to work out with them but we have every confidence that a deal will be done that both sides are happy with. 

Essentially currency union in return for Faslane probably with some sort of transitional period on both sides. It'll cost us some cash but it's only a few percent of the budget and we'll do it because we believe that if they want to leave the UK they have that option. Also we have good relations with the Republic of Ireland and we intend to have good relations with an independent Scotland.

The precedent for this is the Republic of Ireland's separation. The UK legislated to say that even though Ireland left the Commonwealth Irish citizens were not considered foreign from the perspective of the UK. So all the Irish people working in the UK didn't have to leave or get a work permit.

It really shows how fragile the industry is for CPW &amp; P4U if you run a business that relies on, essentially your competitors even if you do have an agreement in place to sell their services. 

I find it interesting that P4Us management is insisting that Vodafone were happily going along to only change their mind at the last minute.

An example of the opposite is Russia, where they have allowed the law to be shaped by religious belief and gay bashing is accepted and not challenged.

Now not all Muslims want to kill gay people of course, but polls show they overwhelmingly see it as morally wrong. The problem is then that once you allow a religious text to overrule a countries laws, then the crazies take center stage.

Some people will warn you about ""missing"" episodes, but don't let that discourage you. Every single episode that was lost has been reconstructed (some more effectively than others) and you can follow the storyline if you pay attention and try not to miss anything. A lot of these reconstructions are just a series of still-shots going like a slide show, and then they use audio which was often recorded on hand-held tape recorders by fans at home. There are a few serials where the show is still trying to hit it's stride and the writing falls a bit short, and it gets compounded by also being reconstructed. These will be the hardest to get through, but they stop at the Third Doctor. However, a lot of the really good episodes are fully intact and can be viewed normally without being reconstructed, and those will help you get through.

That balance of trade stuff is very misleading, first of all they remove all net contribution for oil and gas industry from the whole of the UK (which includes stuff which is refined in England as well stuff from imports, and crucially the money made in London from oil trading). It also conveniently doesn't remove any of the current account deficit caused by Scotland's trade with the rest of the world which wouldn't count against rUK any more. 

I think the main problem with all these arguments are they you can show whatever you want since there is a significant amount of interpretation going on, and it's extremely hard to prove anything one way or another. 

However going back to whether there may be cuts to Scotland's spending, the main problem is that there is now a perception (whether right or wrong) that Scotland is taking more than it contributes.

&gt;A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player (...) trips or attempts to trip an opponent

I think that we all can agree that this is is the case, and that a free kick is the very least we can expect. 

&gt; A player is cautioned and shown the yellow card if he commits (...) unsporting behavior.

I would definitely say that this incident is a matter of unsporting behavior, because the only purpose of the offense was to provoke and frustrate Balotelli. It wasn't as part of the game, due to the ball being far away from the incident.

But I don't think it's a red card, and here is why:

&gt; A player, substitute or substituted player is sent off if he commits any of the following seven offences:

* serious foul play
* violent conduct
* spitting at an opponent or any other person
* denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball (this does not apply to a goalkeeper within his own penalty area)
* denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity to an opponent moving towards the player's goal by an offence punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick
* using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or gestures
* receiving a second caution in the same match

I don't think that the incident qualifies under any of the offences. You could argue that it's violent conduct, but that really is pushing it in my opinion. 

tl;dr: From what I can read from the official football laws I don't think this is a red card incident.

Also starting Hill is a bit of a piss-take. If this was honestly part of their gameplan as a plan b to the wingbacks, ie putting out a fullback with some bite, they should have put focus on bringing in someone new.

If you look at Germany, they don't have any *one* city which is most important. Berlin is the political capital of Germany, but Frankfurt is the financial capital. Frankfurt has all the banks but Hamburg has the 2nd busiest port in Europe, and has a huge bulk of German media. Hamburg might export all the stuff but Munich manufactures it, with companies like BMW, Siemens, and other major German manufacturing companies. All the while you've got little old Cologne insuring everyone everywhere, and making a bucketload of cash from doing that, as well as plenty of media stuff there too. I could go on....

There are all *big* cities with real clout. You don't get that sort of balance in the UK and personally I feel that regionalism with regional capitals might actually allow for focus on local cities more. The larger west midlands region would have its capital of Birmingham, and the focus would be on how do you improve that city, not just at a city level (not enough money) but at a regional level of 5 million people (much more money). I think the UK would benefit immensely from federalising, and focussing on bringing English 2nd tier cities up in importance a great deal. Not just Birmingham, but Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield. I listed 5 German powerhouses and now I just listed 5 English cities, but I bet no-one thinks of Sheffield on equal footing with London, or even just with Manchester.

I believe federalisation would be key to changing this, and revitalising much of the UK.

&gt;but I could almost guarantee you'd see every local district/county councillor suddenly in the political seats around here, and most of them are absolute cunts.

Yeah man, it takes more effort on behalf of the citizens for it not to be shit. Civic engagement in most of the countries I listed above is way higher than in the UK, where most people just vote every 4 years (or not, if they're young) and that's it.

That said, it would be a solution whereby people in blocks of about 5 million could have the policies they wanted for their region, vary taxation and spending, and really control their own lives to a higher degree without resentment that some other region was running things without considering them (which is basically what everyone feels about the ""london bubble"" right now).

I've been in support of federalisation for the UK for years, since it solves the westminister bubble and imo devolved parliaments in three of the four nations but not the fourth are untenable in the long term.

There has to be a solution, the three I can think of are break up the union (traitorous), get rid of the devolved parliaments (a step backwards) or federalise.",0,1410769583,null,0,1410770143,0,ckiqozu,t3_2gdeud,t1_ckiqozu,t1_ckiqleq,null,1427005244,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Robin Hood he was wrong about, that's true. The fact that he continued to deny it was a pretty big mistake, although I took that more as disbelief that he could've been wrong in the first place.

The hiding creatures, though, he was never actually proven wrong. As far as we know he never found them but that doesn't mean he was wrong. We still don't know for sure what was under the blanket.

true,the_oncoming_storm,CommonWeal,,"I think that there have been a few instances of, what I'd like to term ""poor judgement"". For example, the misrepresentation of Lucinda Creighton's comments (or rather, not deeming it necessary to report that she claimed to have been misrepresented by the BBC, or that the BBC were later censured by the BBC Trust over the issue). 

Perhaps, also, the day long exposure given to No ""grassroots"" campaign Vote No Borders, the day after it appears to have sprung into existence from an office in London. 

However (and I'm not normally one for waiting a tinfoil hat), there seem to have been a few additional instances recently. For example, describing the march in Edinburgh on  Saturday as a ""pro-union rally, joined by thousands"", rather than explicitly reporting that it was an ""Orange March"". Or, when the banking story developed last week, the radio news bulletins that I heard continued to report throughout the day that the banks were moving without also clarifying that jobs and operations were not to be affected.

A lot of the time I think BBC bias claims come from instances of ""omission"", rather than deliberately twisting the story the other way. For example, I've heard the occasional reference to Yes and No campaigns ""holding meetings across the country"", which I feel would perhaps be better represented by including the fact that the Yes events outnumber the No events at a ratio of 100:1, or that Better Together keep cancelling joint debates at the last minute. A similar issue could be raised surrounding the (lack of) reporting of the large Yes supporter gathering in Glasgow last Saturday. There was a lot of focus on the Orange March in Edinburgh, but the Yes story focused on Alex Salmond canvassing.



In addition to what you identify, I have four main problems with the BBC coverage.

Firstly, there's been too much reporting and not enough journalism. Merely stating what BT or Yes spokesmen have said, rather than trying to ascertain the truth value of any propositions through analysis or investigative journalism. 

Secondly, the structure and quality of debates and other programmes has been terrible, and has had a near singular focus on the process, not the ""why"". Alternative visions of independence beyond the SNP have barely had an airing.

Thirdly, I have an issue with the screen time given to each campaign. It seems the BBC has reported this mostly along ""main"" party political lines: Here's what the SNP say, here's what the Tories say, here's what Labour say...  but given it's not a party political issue, it's the wrong way to go about it. Last week I witnessed full press conferences by Cameron, Miliband and Brown on BBC News 24, while Alex Salmond's conference was cut away from to report on the Pistorius trial. Patrick Harvie's screen time has been almost non existent outside of debates.  

Finally, there has been a clear regression in the quality of reporting as the referendum draws near, caused by dispatching the London media  to Scotland to report on the referendum, instead of having knowledgeable Scottish journalists present and filter the debate to the rest of the UK. As a result, we're retreading issues from months ago rather than breaking any new ground (the statements from Bob Dudley and Standard Life, for example). 

For the most part, I'd follow the maxim: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity (or incompetence, or inadequate staffing).

In general I'm not worried about the long term prospects either way, although I do think we would be marginally worse as two countries. The main problem is in the short to medium-term, there will be huge uncertainty, there will be less investment (in Scotland and to a lesser extent rUK) since companies will want to wait and see the outcomes from the negotiations, as well as what type of government Scotland will have. I think Sterling will take a beating, which normally would help exporters but I fear the uncertainty will balance out any benefits. There will be huge capital flight from Scotland as I don't think there will be a currency union. In the end I imagine Scotland would have a difficult first 10 years as an independent country and conversely to what the general desire seems to be, there will have to be spending cuts (due to the government having to pay higher interest as well as building a buffer, I think the oil and gas hopes are too optimistic) and there will be higher inflation (due to the higher cost of running a business in Scotland, mainly due to geography) . 

I think you are being very optimistic if you think things will be sorted out in 18 months, I think the negotiations will be difficult as there are a lot of contentious issues, and I generally don't think politicians are that competent.

- never charge to cross a light as it's changing where traffic is waiting to filter across
- be very wary of cars waiting to pull out onto the road your riding down, I typically move more centrally when I see them so that they see me quicker
- if there's no room to be safely overtaken, take the lane so you can't be squeezed

I've never experienced this personally but after my crashes I definitely experienced some uneasiness (possibly even fear). Some suggestions you could try that might help:

Take the bike round the block or to the shops. Just get used to being back on it. Ride slowly and carefully.

Practise your route on a weekend early in the morning when it's quiet. Try to enjoy the ride and remember how pleasant cycling is when the roads aren't full of motor vehicles.

Leave earlier for your commute - the earlier you're out the quieter the roads are. Tell yourself it's not a race - your job is to get to work safe, not to get to work fast.

By some new safety gear - reflective clothing, new lights, reflective accessories (arm/leg bands, spoke reflectors), or a new helmet. Hopefully these will make you feel more safe. Hell, go for a dorky mirror if it'll help - you can always take it off later and who cares what you look like?

Tune up your bike - put some fresh brake pads on, get the cables nice and tight and clean and oil the chain. Your bike will feel better and you will feel more in control when it's running optimally. If you haven't had a service for a while you could even take it to a shop for new cables to get that 'new bike' feel.",0,1410771473,null,0,false,0,ckir0bv,t3_2gftfm,t1_ckir0bv,t3_2gftfm,null,1427005098,6,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,6

When the same thing was done in the States in order to assess sexual assault issues on university campuses, what occurred was a slanted representation of people who had experienced this kind of behaviour themselves - those unaffected were less inclined to answer. The statistic that often gets thrown around in the US (which is wildly inaccurate by any intelligible estimations) is that 1 in 5 female college students will be the victims of sexual assault. The reality is that 1 in 5 female college students *who bothered to respond to the survey* were victims of sexual assault. It had such a high non-response rate that if you suppose that most of the non-responders were not affected, suddenly the number is greatly diluted. Factor in the fact that this particular survey applied the term sexual-assault hideously liberally, and the real number was likely vastly different (albeit that the UK one in this particular article is likely far less skewed in that regard than the American counterpart, I still feel that the article could be trying to miss-sell verbal abuse as sexual assault).

I'm about to go into my 4th year as a student, and I've not observed much of this ""lad"" culture really. There's a bit of it, sure, but it only constitutes a small minority of students. If it does transpire that 37% of female students really have been subjected to this, it will still be important to maintain the distinction between 37% of female students being victims and 37% of male students being perpetrators. If a student has groped one person inappropriately, chances are they've groped plenty. My fear about movements in this direction is that we'll end up going the way of American Universities where all male students are patronisingly assumed to be perpetrators, despite the fact that very, very few of them are actually that way inclined.",0,1410772091,null,0,false,0,ckir3vj,t3_2gfyw2,t1_ckir3vj,t3_2gfyw2,null,1427005051,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

The majority of the oil off the west coast is likely to require a higher oil price than $100 to be profitable.

There is clearly absolutely no logical argument for us to have a say in whether or not Scotland should have independence, as to do so would entirely defeat the purpose. And yet the outcome does very much affect us.

I think the argument that we should have a say in it is really just a way of saying that we don't think anyone should have a say in it. That this is something that shouldn't even be happening. 

There is, of course, a certain amount of envy involved. For those of us living outside the South East of England, the notion of under-representation is all too familiar and yet we do not have the option of doing anything about it in the way that the Scots do. There is a sense that if Scotland goes, it will take with it any chance of reform in the rest of the UK as the people with the loudest voice and strongest argument against the status quo are planning just to quit the game altogether and leave the rest of us to it. 

But then, of course, why shouldn't they? They are under no obligation to stay and, again, there is no logical argument for them to think about how independence would affect the rest of the UK, only how it will affect Scotland. But for many it is not about logic. It is hard not to have an emotional response when, as many of us have, you essentially realise that a large group of  people at worst don't like you and at best don't care about you. 

Most of us are not the Government. We are powerless to do anything and, for the most part, saddened by the fact that the separation of our nations is even being considered. But the biggest kick is that deep down we all know that it doesn't matter in the slightest what we think about it and some, like Paxman, will react by trying to pretend that it does.

&gt; At the point of independence, this Government proposes an inclusive model of citizenship for people whether or not they define themselves as primarily or exclusively Scottish or wish to become a Scottish passport holder. People in Scotland are accustomed to multiple identities, be they national, regional, ethnic, linguistic or religious, and a commitment to a multi-cultural Scotland will be a cornerstone of the nation on independence.

&gt;We plan that British citizens habitually resident[296] in Scotland on independence will be considered Scottish citizens. This will include British citizens who hold dual citizenship with another country. Scottish born British citizens currently living outside of Scotland will also be considered Scottish citizens.

&gt;Following independence, other people will be able to apply for Scottish citizenship. For example, citizenship by descent will be available to those who have a parent or grandparent who qualifies for Scottish citizenship. Those who have a demonstrable connection to Scotland and have spent at least ten years living here at some stage, whether as a child or an adult, will also have the opportunity to apply for citizenship. Migrants on qualifying visas will also have the option of applying for naturalisation as a Scottish citizen.

&gt;The UK allows dual or multiple citizenship for British citizens. If a British citizen acquires citizenship and a passport of another country, this does not affect their British citizenship, right to hold a British passport or right to live in the UK. The Scottish Government will also allow dual citizenship. It will be for the rest of the UK to decide whether it allows dual UK/Scottish citizenship, but we expect the normal rules to extend to Scottish citizen.

People aren't being denied citizenship of anywhere if they want it and no one is being denied it right now.

As far as injuries, their squad doesn't look like it's too bad but then 4 strikers being able to rotate was one of their key determiners last season IMO. All of them got a decent amount of goals and most of them were injured for a bit. Their CM is reinforced but I think their attack might suffer if there's injuries. And I'm sure they're probably worried about that. So yeah there's not that much of a problem unless at least 2 strikers get injured. But their team wasn't particularly solid before and they need those goals. They went large periods of last season when some of their best players were either injured or not bothered. It really showed. 

If they had all been fit constantly they would have won last season easily but they didn't, and only just won it despite their squad depth. At least the full season gives them the chance to use those players but in a two leg tie against a top european side missing silva might ruin them. Missing Aguero and Jovetic might make them too predictable. Honestly those scenarios seem quite likely to me, even before the knockout stage when they need to get important points.

Dont believe me ? See what happens to the price of stamps and deliveries come independence, likewise the cost of food or goods in stores, currently the uk offsets the true cost by pooling the overall cost, so a letter delivered down the road that costs almost nothing to deliver is charged the same as delivering to scotland which costs a lot more to deliver and makes a ""loss"".

&gt; 37% of women and 12% of men who responded said they had faced **unwelcome sexual advances**. Under UK law ""inappropriate touching and groping"" **constitutes sexual assault**, though the survey does not use the term.

See where the article makes the leap? One moment it's discussing and providing a statistic for sexual *advances*, the next it's discussing the legality of sexual *assault*. This is my point. It would seem to me that the intention here is to mislead the reader into seeing that 37% of women were sexually *assaulted*, which clearly was not the finding of the survey. If this was not the intention, then this portion of the article was poorly thought through.

I don't think you'll find that I was attempting to pass off cat-calling as being inconsequential, simply not of the caliber of sexual assault, and I'm sure you'll agree. Sexual assault is a large banner. A male rape victim under current law is likely to get a charge against his attacker (if one is achieved at all) under the banner of sexual assault rather than rape. Considering that people who have been subjected to this are considered victims of sexual assault, comparing sexual assault to cat-calling is entering very shaky ground.

Also please, lose the concept of gender role in a sexual assault/rape scenario. Men are not always the perpetrators. It's not just women who have lived these experiences, and the risk that such an attitude takes is that scenarios like [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/male-statutory-rape-victim-nick-olivas-must-pay-child-support-2014-9) can occur, which is precisely why I fear our country moving towards the more black and white approach to these situations adopted by the US.

Maybe we should be listening to both sides of the argument. There's no dialogue involved in ""maybe we should let women decide."" Maybe we should listen to what everybody has to say and reach a mutually agreeable stance. You sound awfully like you've been exposed to too much radical feminist thought when you can pass off a persons input because they belong to a *""bunch of men""*. The experiences of all students on a campus are important when assessing something like this, *including* those with no experience of sexual assault. If a campaign to ban tinned spaghetti because it is was a choking hazard considered solely the experiences of people who had eaten tinned spaghetti and choked on it, then of course they would deem it to be a more severe issue than it actually was. This does little to diminish the plight of the people who *had* choked on tinned spaghetti, but it *does* impact the nature of a sensible approach to dealing with the issue.",0,1410775738,null,0,false,0,ckirog8,t3_2gfyw2,t1_ckirog8,t1_ckirekk,null,1427004784,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Still, people should be equally free not to vote and not voting is a choice that should be as respected as voting and there is nothing inherently better about a greater percentage of people casting a ballot and indeed the lack of support for all parties and the small percentages of the population that actually vote for them indicate they do not have a mandate of support and exemplify a healthy contempt for politicians that is worthy in and of itself.",0,1410775788,null,0,false,0,ckiroqs,t3_2gfqv1,t1_ckiroqs,t1_ckir121,null,1427004782,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Wholesale political reform.

AV was a stepping stone that was wasted but true proportional representation is what really needs to happen, I personally don't care if our government is in England, UK or EU (or even UN) so long as it is democratic and not nationalism/fear/flag-waving driven. We need real reform so there are not wasted votes and a massive cull on political offices.

Might not be popular but I would get rid of the Parliament in Scotland and Welsh assembly in a heartbeat, the lords, the PCC's (with their laughable &lt;20% turnouts) and half the EU lot, not to mention every district council in the UK. Every single one of these debates just stirs up trouble, the only people who benefit are politicians as they always get more money and more posts out of these activities.

I think Scottish frustration with Westminster is justified but independence is the childish response to the problem, a ‚Äúcan't solve the world so we will just play by ourselves‚Äù approach.

If anything it was handed to you on a plate. The Labour government stopped the roll out of devolution referendums in England because there was such a lack of interest. In contrast it has been a struggle for Scotland to gain meaningful devolution and this referendum would not be here if the SNP hadn't gained a majority in a parliament designed to never have a majority because the other parties, even pathetically the AV Referendum proposing Lib Dems banded together to block it due to ""lack of support"".


And I don't want this to sound mean, I just find it odd that Scotland goes through such long processes and has longstanding popular political campaigns on the issue of devolution / independence, while nothing but the tiny English Democrats seems to exist south of the border and there is absolutely no interest when referendums are handed to them anyway, yet apparently Scotland gets given all of this to spite England?",0,1410777096,null,0,false,0,ckirwt4,t3_2gd4hm,t1_ckirwt4,t1_ckirj57,null,1427004676,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

day, details of all classes of relevant securities issued by the company, 
together with the numbers of such securities in issue.

An offeror or

details relating to its relevant securities by 9.00 am on the business 
day following any announcement identifying it as an offeror or potential 
offeror, unless it has stated that its offer is likely to be solely in cash.
Any such announcement should include, where relevant, the International

If the newspapers aren't interested, it is likely that no-one else will be, as to have any sort of opinion would mean seeking one out for yourself. 

Scottish Independence has a narrative and emotional aspect that it is very easy for the media to talk about, in a way that the purely functional debates about voting systems and regional administration do not. At the moment these issues are being discussed in relation to the Independence referendum, but I suspect will disappear if and when it all dies down. 

I don't mean to suggest that Scotland is voting on independence *to spite* England (although no doubt a few individuals will see it that way).  Instead they are doing so *in spite of* England. While it would be unreasonable to suggest that the effect on the rest of the UK should be taken into consideration, it doesn't mean that we can't hope they do.

This is the most moronic thing i have read in a while, the data simply doesn't exist, you cant extrapolate current performance to future performance assuming no change .

All that needs to happen is major businesses move south (which is very likely), government contracts are no longer awarded preferentially (as they wont be) and you have a high drain on start up capital to fund all these new departments and expenses that are currently funded by the uk.

In simple terms, all essential services in the uk are divided between more people so the efficiency is greater, that isn't the same in scotland so the maximum potential efficiency is less.

E.g a hotel that has 10 times the rooms as a smaller hotel has more efficiency and potential since the asset costs are more efficiently utilised, i.e the cost of a vacuum cleaner is the same but the usage is greater in the big hotel than the small hotel, meaning the cost of the service in a like per like basis (vacuuming a room) is less for the big hotel.

If we maintain this correlation, and use their statistics for a moment, we'd ascertain that around 25% of these sexual assaults are inflicted upon men. A term I see frequently jugged by feminists is ""rape culture"". Do you want to see an example of real rape culture? Read [this article](http://www.businessinsider.com/male-statutory-rape-victim-nick-olivas-must-pay-child-support-2014-9). Not only have you got an example of the law failing to protect a victim; not only have you got an example of a victim being made to feel responsible for what happened to them; here you have a victim of being held *legally accountable* for what happened to them. When you recklessly, without consideration for alternative perspectives, promote the idea that sexual assault is something that happens **to** women, **by** men, this is what you get - political and legal leverage. In the US a female college student need only to cry rape to have a male peer put behind bars. The current state of affairs in some US states with regards to governing sex crimes on university campuses is a complete circus, and I genuinely believe that biased feminist media and the slanted misinterpreted statistics they cite are directly responsible for that situation.

I would hate to see our country turn the same way when it comes to managing this issue, which is why I'm very quick to criticise and attempt to get to the bottom of articles such as this. Endorsing lapse and haphazard methods of gathering data could very quickly spell the beginning of the end. As my post explains, there are many issues present with both the method of gathering data and the conclusions drawn by this article. The method and the statistics are not sufficient enough to make some of these claims. Before long, somebody cites this on Wikipedia, it gets blurred along the way, is cited in an academic journal, some XKCD-style citogenesis occurs and before long politicians are citing the ""fact"" that 1-in-3 female students in the UK are sexually assaulted, which is blatantly horseshit and represents a major potential problem for both male students *and* real victims of sexual assault. It might sound ludicrous when written down like this, but the president of the USA has been known to cite the 1-in-5 fact with regards to female college students in the US, yet that ""fact"" has been proved to worthless time and time again.

I'd be less fearful of them thinking ""all men grope"" if feminists the other side of the pond hadn't relentlessly proven an inability to properly understand and employ statistics (or at least a disregard for them), and the public their gullibility to eat these ""facts"" up. As for ""extreme feminist ideology."" If you can't see how dismissing 50% of the worlds population on any issue because of their gender as extreme then I don't know what else to say.

Regardless, you cite the anecdotal nature of the final paragraph of my first post as being somehow telling as to the nature of the rest of my post.

The Currency and Bank Notes Act 1954 defined Bank of England notes of less than ¬£5 in value as legal tender in Scotland.[24] Since the English ¬£1 note was removed from circulation in 1988, this leaves a legal curiosity in Scots law whereby there is no paper legal tender in Scotland. The UK Treasury has proposed extending legal tender status to Scottish banknotes.[citation needed] The proposal has been opposed by Scottish nationalists who claim it would reduce the independence of the Scottish banking sector.[25]

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Rising oil prices are a symptom of a very, very worrying underlying trend, namely the declining [EROEI](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/1661) of fossil fuel reserves and global energy resources generally.  We're getting declining returns on the energy we put into our energy harvesting systems, which is triggering a number of feedback loops.

For example, the oil industry probably needs oil at $100+ to generate new production at the margins (all the $40 oil has been found and drilled), however $100+ oil appears to suppress demand as developed economies currently can't afford it (developing nations seemingly can, for now).  As such demand decreases, oil prices go down, future production goes down, which creates a shortage, which drives the price back up, potentially above what economies can bear, triggering recession.  This pattern goes some way to explaining the woes of the global economy of the last few years.  Energy prices are too high.  Given that oil output and global economic growth are highly correlated, this is worrying in the extreme, and it's not a trend which can continue for very much longer.  Oil companies are also doing rather poorly at the moment.  Something seems likely to give soon, be it large parts of the oil industry which are heavily in debt, or another financial crisis caused by instability due to lack of economic growth.  In his excellent book Drilling Down, (which can be found in naughty pdf format on the internet), Joseph Tainter identified this situation as an energy-complexity spiral.  The implications of this situation are not pretty, and do not allow for a gleaming techno-future where we all have a robot butler.

We're not going to take large steps to fix our energy infrastructure, because we don't have the money or excess energy to do so any more.  This should be evident given the appalling state of the UK's energy infrastructure, and the high likelihood of there being severe power shortages by the end of the decade.

The whole campaign could be seen an insult to a Scot, not 'we are stronger as one nation' so much as 'you're too inept to survive alone, best stay close to momy'.

The No campaign seems to have focussed too much on the negative aspects (which nontheless exist) and threats and currency/financial ultimatums.
The focus should have been on the previous success of the union and showing how the UK has flourished, punching well above its weight on the international stage and become a respected power in Europe.
In an alternate universe, the UK is a weak fringe economy on the edge of europe. Instead, the UK has maintained its competitive edge and become a business hub for all the world.

The idea that Scotland can simply choose to renege on it's fair share of the national debt is a dangerous fantasy. The pre-independence negotiations would never be successfully concluded unless Scotland agrees to take on the debt. Without an agreement, the *status quo* would endure indefinitely.

The credit squeeze is likely to happen as a natural part of your journey to independence. Just read the article to see why.

You need to stop that ASAP, because if you go down that path, then you will start to generate ill-feeling in rUK towards you.

It was planned that each area would vote in a referendum whether they wanted an assembly or not.  

The North East referendum took place on 4th November 2004 (although it was actually 100% postal voting, so saying it took place on a particular date is rather misleading).  The assembly was overwhelmingly rejected (78% no).  As a result plans for votes in the North West and Yorkshire were almost immediately put on hold and eventually abandoned entirely.

Why the North East rejected the idea so comprehensively is to some extent a matter for speculation but I think a major factor was that the powers offered to the proposed assemblies were rather small.  They wouldn't have had any where near the authority of the Welsh or Northern Irish Assemblies, let alone the Scottish Parliament.

true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Sure, but in each of those cases the Commission didn't just resubmit the original proposal, they took out some of the more offensive bits, first. This is just the normal process of negotiation between executive and legislature in places with a properly functioning parliament. We don't see anything like this is in Westminster, it is completely dominated by the front bench who essentially get their way on everything.

The object of exercise here is not to stop TTIP entirely, which isn't going to happen, it is to take out the most offensive parts before it gets passed. Specifically, the investor-state-dispute-settlement system, which MEPs on the economic and finance committee have already said are a problem:

https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/eu-commission-urged-drop-backroom-ttip-deal
&gt; The most contested aspects of TTIP are the regulatory cooperation council and investor-state-dispute-settlement (ISDS). They may deter policymakers from law making in the public interest. Multinational corporations may use ISDS to sue sovereign states if laws negatively affect their profit expectations. However, ISDS is not subject to national jurisdiction but to clandestine international arbitration courts with no right of appeal. ISDS has been introduced to prevent the discrimination of foreign investors in states with shaky rule of law. Does the commission really suggest that the US and the EU compare to failed states? Rather, EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht could not provide any evidence of the economic benefits of ISDS, such as increased foreign direct investment, upon my request

Also that for the last 40 years they have known about all this oil and that they have kept it hidden to prevent Scottish independence but that for some reason just prior to the referendum they gave a licence to go and explore to a company.

I've seen estimates that a hunter gatherer collecting roots gains about 30 times the energy he expends whilst he's out foraging.

A subsistence agriculturalist working a sparse farm generates something like 3 times the energy that he expends.  Agriculture is *much* harder work than hunter-gathering.

Modern, automated, industrial agriculture requires about ten calories of energy in for every calorie of food energy that comes out.  It's extremely inefficient, and in energetic terms is *hugely* subsidised by cheap, abundant fossil fuel energy.  It is a net energy sink, which is only viable because of oil.  When that cheap, abundant fossil fuel energy becomes expensive, scarce fossil fuel energy  (as it currently is in the process of doing), this type of energy sink becomes rapidly unviable.  All automation is the same, it uses much more energy much less efficiently, but is viable due to cheap energy.

Here you are arguing, even if you don't mean to, that Scotland doesn't have to worry about being an EU member because ""look at Norway, they are doing fine"". 

/u/Jai1 is saying that Norway isn't comparable to Scotland economically unless Scotland nationalises their industry (espec. oil). His argument is that nationalisation is key so that policy, yes, *must* be emulated. Even then there is a whole other debate to have but as we seem to be struggling here let's leave it there for now.

You are then making all these silly claims about ""that is for the scottish people to decide"" and stuff, which is nothing to do with the point being argued. I don't think anyone disagrees with that. They might say they are making the wrong deceision, not that it isn't their choice to make.

/u/Jai1 might be wrong but you need to argue against him using facts and figures. Not ""in an ideal world we will do this"" or ""this is a scottish issue, for scottish people"", they simply don't disprove /u/Jai1's point. He might be completely wrong, but you are completely failing to demonstrate it and will continue to do so as long as you rely on appeals to emotion and optimism.

Flying in would certainly be the most convenient option as Birmingham International is a very short journey from the city centre and has good links with Europe, often at a cheaper cost than ground travel. Booking in advance is usually the cheapest - with a quick search I found a FlyBe flight from Paris to Birmingham for ¬£52.

Getting to the UK without flying basically leaves you with two options - le shuttle or a ferry. Using the tunnel requires you to have a motor vehicle so if you're on foot or a bike then it's not an option (which I assume if flying was a possibility then a vehicle isn't involved).

To be honest, once you add in the train/coach fares to the ferry costs they will probably end up costing more than a cheap flight, though I'd recommend having a search yourself. You can book trains via rail operators like [Cross Country Trains](http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/) without paying a booking fee, and collect your ticket from a machine at the station you'll be travelling from using your payment card and a code that is emailed to you. You can book a coach ticket though a coach operator like [National Express](http://www.nationalexpress.com/) - pre-booked coach tickets are usually either print at home e-tickets or an emailed reservation code you give when you board the coach.

&gt; While it's a good sign that I'll find an accommodation, isn't that a bad sign?

There's the rub - I'd assume that to be fair, any referendum would have to be for *the Scottish*, not just the people that live in Scotland.

&gt;they could be outvoted several times over by people who feel they have varying degrees of Scottish-ness and thus should have a say.

If you were born in Scotland and can prove as much, you're Scottish. I don't believe in the legitimacy of relabelling people simply because they've moved elsewhere, certainly not when a referendum like this is involved.

&gt;For an issue of self-determination I think the only fair policy is for the vote to lie with those most directly affected by the decision.

I'm not Scottish, but have Scottish family - an Aunt and Uncle who moved into a care home in Guildford a number of years ago for the climate (they're in their 90's, but frighteningly alert). I don't really see how, after paying taxes in Scotland for a number of decades, they're not allowed a say in something this big. Their offspring who mostly still live there (and therefore they) will be directly affected - so why are they not allowed to choose compared with someone that may have only been in Scotland for five years?

Negotiations will start with both sides a million miles apart. Possible compromises will be floated. Those compromises involve major transfers of cash or assets from rUK to Scotland, or major transfers of risks in the other direction. Pretty much everyone in the rUK writes to their MPs in outrage. An rUK referendum is promised to approve whatever negotiated agreement might be reached. That ties the rUK negotiators' hands, and the compromises evaporate.

Once the silence stops looking, the angel forgets the encounter and keeps minding its own business. However, if the silence is still in the room with its back turned against the angel, the angel is free to attack it.

Therefore, as long as the silence doesn't turn its back on the angel, it can easily escape the room and the angel won't follow him anymore.

The only question here is what happens from the angel's perspective. If it sees a silence from behind, then the silence looks at it, and then the silence turns its back against the angel, does the angel remember seeing the silence's back before, or does it forget while being stone? It wouldn't really matter since it would still attack it, but my guess is same as yours: since the angel's eyes turn to stone, it is blind, so it stops seeing the silence and therefore forgets him. Doctor Who physics are lax enough to accept stone can see, but if you think of how eyes work, light can't get through stone so we can only assume they are blind while petrified.

Loose veg tends to be cheaper then bagged veg - you have said that you only use 2/3 of a bag of spuds - if the bag is 1kg, buy 600g of loose spuds, it'll be cheaper, and less waste.

Also on the veg front - buy the basic veg, not the fancy veg in posh bags. Its the same stuff, it comes from the same farm, in the same soil, the only difference is that your paying for 'nicer' looking, straighter veg. The cheaper stuff tastes the same, but is more gnarled, but that hardly matters when its going to be chopped.

With tinned produced (tomatoes for example) buy the cheaper brands. They are very similar, and in my experience you get more tomato and less tomato water for your money.

Look at what you normally buy, and get the next brand down. 

You may find you save yourself a tenner a week with very little effort.

Also try another shop, I would put Ocardo in the Booths/Waitrose class of shop (expensive posh ones).

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt;  one of thousands that are being ignored (dvla is another)

Ignored by whom? Just because many here are new to this debate that doesn't mean others haven't been going over it in depth for many years.

The passport office and military HQs are the other big ones. But to be honest most of Scotland's institutions are already fully devolved e.g. healthcare, education, transport. Most of the UK wide things like HMRC have offices here which would simply transition over. There is a lot of legal precedent in new nations carrying forward existing laws &amp; procedures until they are re-legislated, it really isn't a big deal.

&gt; collectively all these new departments and administrations will bankrupt scotland

That is completely nonsensical. 

&gt;  See what happens to the price of stamps and deliveries come independence

The privatisation of the Royal Mail is going to have a far greater impact in that! They'll be lobbying for an end to the ""single cost"" ideal within a few years. 

&gt; likewise the cost of food or goods in stores, currently the uk offsets the true cost by pooling the overall cost, so a letter delivered down the road that costs almost nothing to deliver is charged the same as delivering to scotland which costs a lot more to deliver and makes a ""loss"".

Em, a hugely disproportionate level of UK agriculture is in Scotland, if anything this means higher prices for rUK!

&gt;  you no longer get a service subsidy from a much denser infrastructure rich demographic

That's quite an assumption, I take it you've researched the issue and know for certain that Scotland has a more spread out population? 70% of Scotland lives within the central belt. Raw ""population density"" is not the same as actual population distribution. If 70% of all deliveries are to a small region then it complicates matters greatly, large parts of the country are simply empty so including them in such concerns is invalid.",0,1410783067,null,0,false,0,ckit4u9,t3_2getfz,t1_ckit4u9,t1_ckirma2,null,1427004105,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Roy Keane and the promoted Scott Marshall have clearly had a big influence following the toxic, terrible training methods of Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa.

As for the royal mail example, lol you dont seem to understand that all businesses that sell commercial goods to the public (e.g supermarkets) have all stated the prices will rise because the cost of doing business in scotland is higher than the uk, and thats if scotland is as identical in independence as it is in the uk today, just with a border, in the same way your local convenient small tesco charges different to large tesco, the price of doing business is different, Due to infrastructure and geography.

My point stands though. Only an idiot thinks intelligence means you never make a mistake, no matter how stupid or silly.

I'm not trying to minimise damage, I'm quite happy admitting I made a spelling mistake because I was tired. Infact I'm glad you are proving to be such a prick because you are obviously either an idiot or really thinks a spelling mistake in a title means that the points someone makes in an argument are invalid, or you are a troll, either way I won't be wasting any more time talking to you unless you have something constructive to say.

And if you must know I have mild dyslexia, as do many extremely intelligent people so I am in good company. I'm confident and comfortable enough that I can laugh at cretins like you who try to claim problems with spelling, etc are indicative of intelligence.

I have complained, moaned and they seem to do little about getting a larger bus or make it more frequent. Also it still takes an hour for what used to be a 25 minute car journey.

If I work a different shift, there is little point getting the bus at all, walking into the centre is quicker than some of the buses once you factor in waiting for it, traffic and squeezing yourself aboard at rush hour.  

The way home can be utter shite from about 4 until 7 or so. 

I don't know where First Bus get their drivers from but pretty much all of them are incredibly rude and miserable. Wessex or Abus - it is the opposite, usually friendly and happy. 

I don't know what the solution is because Bristol is very congested, but it is the seemingly random nature which gets me, some days you wait 30 minutes for a bus then 3 full ones turn up and the driver demands you pay ¬£2.50 for what the day before was a ¬£1.50 journey. You then complain and a month later a letter comes through with an apology. I would cycle but medical reasons suggest I shouldn't (hence not driving). Give it some time and I will forget that I reckon, this is doing far worse to my health.

&gt; One of the big arguments from the yes campaign is the economic benefit for Scotland if they get independence.

Which makes perfect sense, if we control our own finances it can be put to use inwardly investing on things which are desperately needed, like infrastructure &amp; jobs etc.

&gt; This is largely derived from oil resources in the North Sea.

That's not the case at all, currently it would stand at around maybe 10-15% of our overall GDP, which is certainly a decent chunk of our economy, but to say it's ""largely derived from oil"" is simply wrong. So it follows that if oil would currently make up 15% of an independent Scottish economy, then that figure as a percentage of the UK's overall economy is fairly small &amp; insignificant. So I don't see how that would drastically affect services for rUK.

&gt; Do I get a say in this? No.

Of course you don't, neither do Scottish people who live abroad, the referendum is voted on by the people who live here, no matter their nationality, creed or colour. Anyway, if you read a lot of people's opinions on the subject, we are a country full of subsidy junkies who rely on hand-outs from our masters in Westminster and if it was put to a vote in rUK, then again judging by the general consensus, you'd be well shot of us and better off without us.

&gt; Do I believe that living on one side of Hadrian's Wall makes me any more entitled to the benefits of exploiting this resource? No.

Does that mean that if we do vote for independence that we should have a percentage of rUK's profits from shale gas or it's financial sector? Of course we shouldn't!

As for my glib, throwaway comment ""You jumped, you weren't pushed."" (it had been a long day and I was getting my shit together to head out, so I apologise for that) /u/joinville_x more or less hit the nail on the head with his comment ""you have to take responsibility for your politics and politicians."" Politics in Scotland has been drifting away from Westminster politics for longer than I care to remember, a large number of us **do not like** being governed from Westminster, I'm fairly certain that a reasonable percentage of rUK don't particularly like Westminster either, but we have a one off chance to change this forever come Thursday.

However, I also understand people who feel that we are ""leaving them behind"" (which seems to be your viewpoint, unless I'm mistaken), this was one of the things which was discussed at length over the weekend, it's not an easy choice and, yes, I certainly have a sense of guilt toward people in rUK, especially those in areas of the country who are also largely overlooked and ignored by central government.

So, the way I see it is that **we are not** pushing you or anyone else under the bus, it's just that you seem to have been edging out into the road over the last however many years and have only just now noticed that there is a bus heading your way.

&gt; The IRA and Sinn Fein does not and has never represented all ""republicans"" and therefore cannot be attributed to all of these killings.

This gives a much more extensive breakdown of deaths in the troubles, the IRA are regularly attributed with anywhere from 45-60% of deaths in the troubles, in this case it gives the more accurate number of 49%. so whilst they can't be attributed of all sectarian killings they are responsible for the overwhelming majority as the Nationalist paramilitaries were never as divided as the Unionists.

You're very unlikely to find somewhere that specialises in doom or stoner metal, but there are several venues which you might get some in, along with a variety of the other genres of metal.

For pubs/bars, there's Subside, Scruffy Murphys or the Flapper, with Subside being cheap but a bit dingy and the other two being a bit nicer but more expensive, with the first two definitely likely to play music you'd enjoy, and the Flapper possibly (it seems to go between metal and indie nights, and I haven't figured out the pattern yet, usually too drunk by the time I leave whoops)

As far as clubs go it's gonna be Eddies, you're definitely not gonna get either of those at the other alternative club in Birmingham, Uprawr. Might have to request it though at Eddies, they usually play more of the crowd pleasers although are definitely open to requests!

true,Messisfoot,null,null,"Ah, finally. My time to shine. Sorry for the wall of writing.

First thing to notice, shares/stocks are viewed as object that can either store wealth or grow wealth, depending on how they view the A. the market is going up/down (bull/bear). and B. how they view the share/stock in question itself will behave (bullish/bearish).

Now, between 04 - 06, the World Economy was the at tip bubble of the housing crisis market. Money was everywhere and anyone could get a loan.

So people perceived the market to be continuing its bull run.

Now, if you look at our performance from 03 - 05-06 seasons, you see that during or, at the very least, by the end of the 05-06 season, people were feeling bullish about investing in Tottenham. After having seen our team as a bottom table team after years of glory, it was encouraging and possible to believe in the club and aspire for glory. It's only recent that Top 4 seems to be the yard stick at WHL, and talks of title challenges would have been laughed at at the beginning of the millennium. If you have the money, why not invest some too? 

This period of encouraged investors in an high risk (investment can be risk) encouraging market (the economy), lasted until the transition of 07-08 season. Here you see the slope take on a negative relationship between time and price (basically, the line went up and down).

Something to consider is, unless you have an economics/finances background, this period of growth might be deceiving. Sometimes, initial investments and heightened animal spirits (fancy econ. word for how people feel about the market) about the market the stock, can lead others to buy in as well, who normally wouldn't. Now that the prices is showing to increase, the risk-reward variable encourages you to make the purchase. This can continue, and in fact, its how we got the dot.com and Housing Crisis bubbles. As people see other people buying and the price rising, they want to get on the escalator to money.  

This must mean that suddenly, some share holders start to feel bearish about Tottenham shares/stocks. Mind you also, that this was about the time that the sub-prime mortgage crisis hit the U.S. and spiraled everyone else out of control. Now you have investors who are bearish about TTNN shares, but they are also bearish about the market (economy) itself. 

Investors, at least if you don't listen to Fox, tend to move their assets to cash to ride out the economicfuckstorm that has been unleashed. Hence why you see the sudden drop between 07/08 transition all the way to now. In fact, [you witness it in every market across the globe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis#mediaviewer/File:U.S._Fixed_Investment_as_Pct_GDP.png)

I can only guess as to why it continue to fall. My guess is that given that, technically, we're still in a recovery, people don't see TTNN stocks as a wise investment. Also, it might be worth watching the performance of the stock after CAIN HOY's buyout will affect the price. I'll make a post after research.

Part of which is Scottish.

&gt;If the UK wants Scotland to take on some of that debt, it has to expect to give Scotland something in return.

Exactly. Scotland gets to keep the assets bought with that debt. It's not an excuse to demand other things. In your analogy, the friend who's been renting your house, would be demanding to own the house while refusing to pay the mortgage unless you also handed over some control of your other finances. That would simply be wrong, unfair, he would have no legal leg to stand on to force you to do this, and you wouldn't stand for it.

Your analogy is perfect to show the immorality of his position. The ""friend"" is demanding the house from you without the debt. That's not a negotiation it's just nonsense. You would not give him the house under those circumstances, you'd simply wait until he could negotiate like an adult. If Salmond sticks to his wish to take all the assets from the UK (ie all the results of government spending), without the debt, then negotiations will fall down until the Scots appoint an adult to replace him.

&gt;What is the UK going to do, roll the roads up and take them home?

No. The UK will not hand over control of the reins until real negotiations happen. As you wouldn't hand over your house if your friend demanded it with threats to leave you with the mortgage. There's no magically set timeline for this handover. It'll happen when negotiations are complete.

What if the vote comes out like this?

* Yes: 39%
* Devo-max: 32%
* No: 28%

At first glance Yes have won by a clear majority... yet actually on closer inspection 60% of people voted to stay in the UK. The trouble is the SNP can be so incredibly manipulative with public opinion that they could probably twist the above outcome to appear to support independence and then drag it through the courts, even though that isn't necessarily what people voted for. Even if Scots voted to stay in the UK, does Westminster then push ahead with Devo-max even though less than a third of voters actually stated it as their preference? Although we all know it's true that most of the 39% who voted yes would be happy to have devo-max, that can't just be assumed... and there is no information from the ballot to suggest that is their preference.

That large bump is ENIC grabbing Sugar's stake at a premium price.

true,wanson,lfc68,,"Thank God it's not too bad. Joe Allen integral to our 3-man midfield, whether it's a diamond or 4-3-3. He's going to be a very important player for us this season. His positioning and break-up-play are excellent and he is great at keeping possession.

Coutinho and Lallana can both play in the central midfield role but they aren't the same type of player and as we saw against Villa, we struggle in the middle of the park with just Henderson and Gerrard as holding midfielders.

Gerrard needs Allen next to him to break up play and give him the space to spray balls around the park. It's really unlucky that Can was injured too because I think he is Allen's backup in the squad. Lucas is the closest player (in terms of style) we have to these two but he's not as mobile and tends to get dribbled past more meaning he's often chasing back and giving away cheap fouls. 

The main problem with our midfield at the moment is how to compliment Gerrard. Because Gerrard absolutely has to play but he's not as quick enough to play an advanced role in BR's system. BR is accommodating Gerrard into his system by playing him at DM. However, the only way this works is having two of Allen and Henderson or Can with him in midfield. 

I think that going forward BR wants to use a 4-2-3-1 system. We definitely bought the players capable of this system during the summer. Lallana, Markovic and Balotelli can play wide or through the center as the no. 10 (Balotelli is more suited to the wide left). These compliment the other attacking players already at the club - Coutinho, Sterling, Suso, Ibe are all ideal players for a 4-2-3-1 system with Allen/Can as the holding CMs and Henderson as a box-to-box midfielder. 

I think this is what BR has in mind for the future when Gerrard finally hangs up his boots and we've already seen us trying to play this system with Gerrard as the holding CM against Southampton (it didn't work).

Our top priority in the next transfer window should be a CM to play this system. My top choice right now would have to be Morgan Schneiderlin (sorry Southampton).

I live in Manchester, and I'm a Tory, for the record.

&gt; Just in case there's confusion, this is the clip the daily show used.[1]   - he wanted all the oil revenues devolved to Scotland now. 

So is he talking about historic revenues or future revenues? His question isn't clear, but it's not necessarily stupid. If he wants historic revenues back, then yes, that's stupid; but if he simply meant that Scots want the revenue from the oil found off their shores retreived by their countrymen, then that's not really a stupid question at all, it's entirely reasonable. 

For example: I'm sure at least 68% of English people would like the revenues from fishing activities off the shores of England to stay in England and not be sent to Scotland, **should Scotland become a different country.** Were the revenues to go to Scotland, even only in part, it would be entirely unreasonable for Salmond (or whoever ends up in charge up there) to laugh at an English person and say he was being stupid if he were to ask why those revenues weren't going to England. Just as Cameron's being unreasonable here.

&gt; e: anyway, France pays into the EU. How would stopping those payments be a sensible idea?

Had several offs in the winter, chalked them up to shit weather. Rode my 1st 125 36 miles home from the dealers, in the dark and it was pissing it down, thought if I could do that then I‚Äôm fine. Had my eyes opened when weather got better, thought I was ready to press on, and went to instructor to get A2 going. He had me doing circles in the yard, after 2 laps he explained how I was doing things incorrectly, and would have been in the wall had I been on anything bigger (at slow speed I was riding clutch, but giving just enough throttle to not stall engine, coasting around turns). I wish I had the eye opener sooner ‚Äì since learning the proper way gave me so much more confidence.

Just take this knock as a lesson. In a big way, you‚Äôre lucky that there‚Äôs seemingly no damage to your bike and the driver was really nice to you and probably could relate. From your other posts it seems you are aware of the fact that a CBT is inadequate for teaching safe riding, only covers bare basics. This has happened at an opportune time really, and sounds like only knock was to your pride/confidence ‚Äì which tuly needs a good knock for any knew rider who‚Äôs just done a CBT haha. Get yourself to an empty car park and practice all the slow-speed off road stuff you did on the CBT. See how small/tight you can get the u-turns and figure of 8s. Watch vids on clutch control etc as well, the less you assume you know now, the more you can potentially learn the easy way and fun way.

The banks that just left in point 3. 

Point being, the outcome can't be *all* things because they are all tradeoffs around the same issue.

If there's a currency union we lose inflationary control *but* you only need inflationary control to bring trade deficits under control. Scotland doesn't have a trade deficit.  Switching to our own weaker currency might result in higher business flight and introduce a trade deficit but that doesn't matter because we'd have inflation control in that scenario. Independence itself might cause business flight, but independence comes with full tax control to encourage return.

So sure, if you say that there will be business flight, no inflation control, a trade deficit, low growth, no currency union *and* a weakening of the pound then yes.. that would end pretty badly. The trouble is it's difficult for all those to happen at once because they have contradictory relationships with each other.

The fact is that Scotland is a resource wealthy, educated, well connected industrial country with an established export economy.

It did, however, happen in Spain. Alfonso XIII was not yet born when his father, King Alfonso XII, died. His pregnant mother, Maria Christina of Austria, served as Regent, and Alfonso XIII became King on his birth, with his mother remaining as the Regent until he turned 16.

You wouldn't like them so much if it was them that had to raise more money through unpopular taxes like raising VAT, the bedroom tax, unemployment benefit cuts etc. I have some sympathy for David Cameron on this - Westminster ultimately has to balance the books, so he is the one responsible for raising money, yet Alex gets to take credit for how it's spent north of the border. That's actually why I think Westminster are genuinely sincere in their efforts to pass through much greater devolution - because putting people like Salmond in charge of raising capital would make them more accountable (which is what Scottish people want from their politicians) and it would also take some pressure of Westminster to make lots of miniscule yet unpopular domestic decisions when in reality what they want to be doing is making bigger global decisions.

I can't really fault Chelsea for how they addressed the situation at all, at least in this window. He was primed and ready to be our first striker off the bench, but he wasn't willing to grow within the great players surrounding him. Chelsea have shown with Courtois that young players *will* get their opportunities to shine, if the talent level is there. However, Lukaku shied away from the competition. 

I posted last year that I had no problem with Lukaku wanting to go on loan. There was a World Cup roster spot at stake,  and there was no guarantee of an opportunity for consistent playing time with us last year. However, with the World Cup done, and with Lukaku failing to set the world on fire, I was slightly disappointed with how he came back with the exact same mentality. Mourinho doesn't *give* PT to *anyone*; everyone has to earn it. But Lukaku came back thinking he already had earned it, simply by the guys ahead of him failing to impress. Chelsea is not a team where they'll play the best of an unimpressive crop for long (as evidenced by the fact that none of our strikers returned this year).

Lukaku wants to be in the spotlight now as a finished product and not as a complementary piece on a big team, and for better or worse, he got his wish. While his goal this weekend was fortuitous in unfurrowing many brows within the media, every dry spell he has going forward will now garner a lot more critique, as his market value has been set, and the value is of a starting-caliber CF in the PL.

Think he'll save Willian for Man City, as he's more defensive on the right than other options, save Ramires.  Costa will be rested to prevent any further injuries (remember while he's supposedly been injured he's slotted 2 past everton, 3 past swansea and played for spain)  Could see Hazard being rested and Salah starting instead but think he will start Hazard.  Zouma should make his first start for the club with Luis at LB. And Dave moving over to RB. I'd also expect the youngsters (Ake, Christensen &amp; Baker) to claim a few spots on the bench)

&gt;__Media Lens__ is a [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media) analysis [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) established in 2001 by [David Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cromwell) and [David Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edwards_(journalist\)). The site is financed by donations from its supporters. The aim of the website is to scrutinize and question the coverage of the [mainstream media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media) of prominent issues and events to draw attention to what they regard as ""the systemic failure of the [corporate media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_media) to report the world honestly and accurately"".  

&gt;Cromwell and Edwards, who remain the sites editors, write regular 'Media Alerts' concentrating on those [mainstream media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media) outlets legally obliged to be impartial (the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) and *[Channel 4 News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4_News)*) or usually considered [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism)  like *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian)*  and *[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent)*. Media Lens frequently disputes the impartiality of the BBC and draws attention to what it sees as the limits within which the liberal press operates.

&gt;The editors invite their readers to challenge journalists, editors and programme producers directly via email, specifically discouraging abusive contact.

If the story is badly researched, poorly written or just plain false they will find it. They've done excellent exposes of the ongoing Iraq turmoil, the UKIP surge and the Scottish referendum in recent weeks. Their posts are fairly irregular but pretty good all things considered.

Scotland is *much* more intwined in the UK banks than Ireland is and Scotland obviously provides more to the UK economy. 

Remember we paid ¬£65bn bailout just to get here, to this shitty position. We're in ¬£1.4*trillion* debt and as I said above, we borrow more ever year because we don't export enough to legitimately keep the value of the pound where it is. We *should* devalue but we don't because the banks need a strong pound and we need the banks to not get any worse. We're that guy who lives the high life by jumping from credit card to credit card. Sure, maybe one day we'll figure out a way to pay of the debt but right now we need to keep jumping or someone takes the car away.

The papers like to say that all the wobbles in currency lately are because people think Scotland might go independent then go down the tubes. That's not really the case. The money left because the UK can't withstand a full split without losing billions. 

The money then went back in when RBS announced they'd re-register in England. That's being spread like *""See! The banks are safe in England, not safe in iScotland""*. That's not the case thought. The banks aren't safe in England with an independent Scotland. The money went back because the market though by making the announcement they'll make a NO vote more likely.

I was under the idea that, though they are derivatives of the word ""bigot"", they actually did have slightly different uses, or at least they seem to. Maybe focusing on ""towards"" is a red herring, but usually an intolerance *towards* somebody does not just mean an unwillingness to accept their opinions, but it can also be an unwillingness to accept their actions, behaviour or choices as valid. Perhaps that makes a difference here? Maybe not.

I do agree with the ""entertain"" / ""tolerate the existence of"" part though, but I don't really think that it fits his usage here... I mean, it seems that he just disagrees with them in the linked bit, and is telling people to ignore them - not stating that the ideas don't exist, or ""*how dare they*"", but more like ""they're being ridiculous.""

Not to turn it into an ""us and them"" type situation, but a lot of issues in this country, such as low employment prospects, job centre sanctions, university fees, housing and general cost of living, disproportionately affect the younger population. Personally I am increasingly of the opinion that policies are there to enable those who have wealth to keep it, and part of that is preventing anyone else from sharing in it, Older people have more wealth. Just how much money are they saving from JSA sanctions? It would be interesting to see whether they would save more by means testing the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences.

I don't think we're shallow at the back at all either, my guess is the goal leak is just the new team settling into new tactics and formations. 

I think the first half of the Swansea game was Jose's fault, which he addressed by putting Ramires on at half time.

If you look down the thread at other posters' comments, there just seem to be a lot of people trying to hide dictionary definitions that they don't like, for whatever reason.

I think the point that Alex was making was that that comment was not engaging with the substance of the article, but sweepingly categorising it as ""scaremongering"" and therefore not worthy of consideration. It's factionalising opinions, essentially - either you're in favour of Scottish independence, or you're ""scaremongering"". Not only does that not provide a counterargument, but it focuses on the motives and personal qualities of the other faction, hence I think ""bigotry"" in the sense that we've been talking about is appropriate.

I guess the problem is that a lot of people now equate ""bigotry"" exclusively with racism, xenophobia, sexism, and homophobia, and might not be aware of the older meaning that the dictionaries still list. There may have been less ambiguous words to use in that context, in all fairness, but it wasn't wrong to use it and it's quite aggravating to see people clinging to their ignorance even when it's pointed out to them. Again, that isn't directed at you, but at the large numbers of posters that have been steadfastly downvoting comments explaining that, actually, that usage of the word does exist and it probably wasn't intended to mean what they took it to mean.
