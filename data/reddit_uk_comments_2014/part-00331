Our culture is better for modern countries based on rule of law, secularim and democracy.

Cultures such as say, certain Black South African subcultures, are much more superstitious and have less of a problem with rape. Which leads to things like this.

Alongside one another, they are far too immobile to sit in front of the defence as they can't support the attack and they can't track back fast enough. You could play Gerrard further up (his old CM/AM position with Torres) but he won't last 90 min and if he does, he won't play every week (this is a tough choice BR refuses to make sadly). 

In any case, Gerrard has learned (somewhat) to recycle the way Lucas does so the latter is dispensable in BR's eyes.

My issue with immigration is that it's been terribly managed. We opened the door wide open to the EU when every other country had caps and quota's which lead to a huge influx of people giving us no time to adjust. The asylum system is a piss take with hundreds of thousands unaccounted for.

Building for the future has a few major flaws:

1) We already have talented youngsters who can't get a game (Ibe, Suso, Teixeira, Wisdom) so why waste money on players to replace the talent we already have rather than giving them a shot?

2) Potential is great but wins nothing now.  CL qualification with a lot of money and helps attract talent and we absolutely have to be consistently in it going forward.

3) All of that potential will be snapped up by other clubs if they show the degree of progress expected/desired.  Look at Sterling who's already being courted by Real, as an example.  Basically it turns us into a selling club/the world's largest youth academy which is not where I think we want to be.

The point of Remembrance Day is that we reflect on all those who died in the two greatest catastrophes of the last hundred years, all those who died in armed conflict since then, and possibly before then as well. The point of the Unknown Soldier was that he could have been *anyone*, from any background, religion, line of work, etc.

While the RBL and the media have a duty to remind us all what it should be about (something that they themselves have forgotten) it is equally important that *we* all try to keep this in mind as well. This particular article does the appeal no favours at all. It does not do for sections of the media to say that wearing a poppy means I support military action. Nor does it do for the other side to say if I don't wear a poppy I don't care about the dead.

It's a shame that this article was written ""to provide balance"" as I think the author would claim, because I just see it as polarizing the argument further.

If people don't want to wear a poppy then that's up to them. It's not obligatory. They should certainly not be demonized for making that choice. And some sections of society and the media would do well to remember the enormous range of ethnicities and religious groups that fought and died on **all** sides in the wars. The poppy is not an Islamophobic symbol, many thousands of Muslims died, as did Christians, Hindus, Jews, etc. That's why they were called *World* wars.

* RM draw Basel, LFC draw Ludogorets: A win against Basel likely puts us through (2-1 or better and we're through, otherwise we just go through the list of tie-breakers), all other results eliminate us on points

* RM lose to Basel, LFC draw Ludogorets: LFC eliminated

* RM defeat Basel, LFC lose to Ludogorets: A win against Basel likely puts us through (2-1 or better and we're through, otherwise we just go through the list of tie-breakers), all other results eliminate us on points, but this one has the added extra scenario of all of it depending on Ludogorets not getting a result against RM.

* RM draw Basel, LFC lose to Ludogorets: LFC eliminated

* RM lose to Basel, LFC lose to Ludogorets: LFC eliminated

--------------------------------

The CL tiebreakers go like this for the group stage:

* This assumes that we have the same result against Ludogorets that Basel have against RM.  If we have a worse result we are eliminated, if we have a better result we are through with a win against Basel.  If LFC and Basel both draw their matchday 5 matches then tiebreakers 6+ all go to Basel, however if they both lose and Basel loses much worse, or they both win and LFC wins by a lot more goals, they could go in Liverpool's favor.

1. higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question; (**This will go to Basel unless we defeat them**)
2. superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question; (**If we defeat Basel we are guaranteed to be at least equal in this one with them**)
3. higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question; (**If we defeat Basel by a single goal for any scoreline other than 1-0 this goes to us**)
4. higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question; ( **this tie-breaker is guaranteed to be a draw because the only way we can get here is if we beat Basel 1-0**)
5. **[tiebreaker 5 only applies to ties of more than 3 clubs]**
6. superior goal difference from all group matches played; (**They have a match coming up against RM, we have a match against Ludogorets, the possiblity of making up 4 goals is quite realistic on that matchday [I mention 4 goals because if we are at -1 when we play them and win, the worst case is that this one is also even, and the only way this comes in to play is if they defeat RM, which would give them at least +1 on goal difference and +1 goal**)
7. higher number of goals scored from all group matches played; (**We need to score at least 6 goals in our last 2 matches to win this tie-breaker if it comes in to play along with a clean sheet against Basel**)
8. higher number of coefficient points accumulated by the club in question, as well as its association, over the previous five seasons. (**I believe this would actually go to us since it also considers coefficient points accumulated by nation**)

I'd take these polls with a massive pinch of salt.

I agree we have messed up rules on spouses (a school friend married an American, she's only just been allowed in) and it needs fixing soon.

Yes it would have been better in the UK, Sweden and Ireland had harmonised their immigration policy with the rest of the EU, it would have taken some of the venom out of the debate today.

I believe though that the government knew far more people would come than they said publicly, at the time they wanted 50% of people to go to university so an easy way to do that is reduce the demand for low skilled work. Nobody can doupt having a high skilled workforce is a good thing, just they were misguided on how many people would want to stay in education. The reality where I was growing up in East Anglia was that the new migrants just took agricultural jobs that had previously been done by Portuguese workers, who intern headed home to benefit from Portugal's building boom.

Asylum is a different issue. Asylum seekers need somewhere to live, if you put them in houses the government gets accused of prioritising them over the local population, if you put them in guest houses you can end up with towns like Great Yarmouth (obviously has a lot of B&amp;Bs) taking a disproportionate amount. This I believe is something that could be done on a European level with people dispersed more evenly amongst member states.

You see, my main problem with Daleks back them was that they were too hesitant to kill. In the 1st season, they weren't. They just let someone live when they were using them. The Doctor survived because of that weird shield that he used.

From that point on, every time the Doctor found Daleks face-to-face, he... talked to them to avoid death.

What kind of mercyless aliens are these? Victory of the Daleks's ones at least didn't let the Doctor trick them till death.

But no, I don't think that Moffat made better use of the Daleks. They are still dumb in comparison with the 1st season.

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; Frankly I don't understand how anyone could argue that Balotelli would have been a better choice than any of the above and probably at least a dozen others.

Money aside I don't think Balotelli is a better choice. But for £16m I think he's a decent buy. Either he comes good and we got a solid striker on the cheap in the same way we did for Sturridge, or he doesn't and we'll be able to sell him for minimal loss. We probably could have bought better, but we'd have paid two or three times as much to do that, and it would completely limit our ability to spend in January and this summer if other and potentially better opportunities come along.

&gt; We already have talented youngsters who can't get a game (Ibe, Suso, Teixeira, Wisdom) so why waste money on players to replace the talent we already have rather than giving them a shot?

Dunno - I have no idea why the coaching staff don't think they're up to scratch just yet. At the very least I'd have kept Ibe to bring on from the bench. Either way we still need more players in the squad - those guys alone don't give us the 16-20 quality players we need for a top level squad with depth.

&gt; Potential is great but wins nothing now. CL qualification with a lot of money and helps attract talent and we absolutely have to be consistently in it going forward.

Fair point, but I guess BR thinks that the squad we have right now is still capable of finishing in the top four. With Arsenal and Man Utd still stumbling in the same way that we are, I don't think it's really out of the question yet either. And winning things now doesn't guarantee winning things later if we've just gambled for a couple of seasons - look how far Utd have fallen after spending years under-investing in youth to stick with established but ageing talent who have all gone on to retire and leave them with a very weak squad.

&gt; Basically it turns us into a selling club/the world's largest youth academy which is not where I think we want to be.

It's not where we want to be long-term, if you eventually get to the status of being a top club then it's a massive benefit. Barcelona have done pretty well recently out of having a huge focus on youth academy, even if it took a bit of time for it to really start paying dividends. 

&gt; I'd say a balanced approach is needed- some young prospects are okay and expected, although it should not be at the sake of your own (e.g. Manquillo over Wisdom/Kelly makes 0 sense to me), but you need a blend of proven in there as well.

I agree with this, and I'd say that our current over-investment in youth rather than experience is part of the reason we're not having the best start to the season (similar to what OP said). But I'd rather we stayed on the side we're on, rather than spend £150m on players who are only good for three or four more years and then be utterly screwed and financially ruined as a club if that doesn't bring an explosion of success and further money. 

I feel like the strategy BR is going for is closer to the Man Utd Class of 92 squad - a sizeable group of players who have been at the club for years plus some top-quality bought talent like Ronaldo and Van Nistelrooy. Barca's approach would be a similar example. The type of squad that goes on to dominate for years, rather than the Chelsea/Man City approach which tends to keep you up there and win a title or two here and there but never breeds long stints of consistent success (or it goes wrong and you pull a Leeds). Aside from the fact that the Chelsea/Man City approach isn't even possible any more now that FFP is a thing.

As a fan I could not really get upset about anything this year, there's a waiting period after you win a title especially one that was so out of left field like last year's would have been. 

Really it was all so deflating. I was at Anfield for the 4-0 against Spurs and the fans were singing ""We're gonna win the league"" and everyone was just full of jubilation and excitement and then when it didn't happen and Suarez left it was like well we have to start over now. We were always gonna have to start over when Suarez left but without the title it's just been tough to watch now. I think fans would have had a much easier time realizing we bought all the players like Can and Markovic, etc for 2-3 years down the road if we'd had that title too.

So yeah, all in all it sucks. Really wish we'd won it and I think it would have helped some with the attitude to start the season but I still think we would have struggled so far given Sturridge being out and all the new players adjusting and old players adjusting to different roles without Suarez.

#*creeaaaaated using PowToon*

Criminalising drugs because of what *might* happen is a pretty poor excuse. Knifes shouldn't be illegal because someone might stab someone, cars shouldn't be illegal because they could crash into people, yet an arbitrary group of drugs should be illegal because someone might assault on them? Anything can be used irresponsibly, like in my example bricks, that doesn't mean people should be sent to prison over having these things.

I have a very similar story to you except I'm a few years behind. I was born in Southampton and still live here. I got my first season ticket at 7 years old and I've had one every year since, I'm going to uni next year so this year will probably be my last for a while. I can't remember my first game but my first game as a season ticket holder was Liverpool at home where we won 2-0. Obviously it went somewhat downhill after that. We were relegated to the championship the same year. For the majority of my time supporting Southampton we were in the Championship or in League One in financial disarray which is why getting promoted back to the premier league is one of my happiest memories, to see the team I watched play against Stockport back in the premier league was an amazing moment.Saints has very much been a part of my childhood, every year I go down to the store when the kits released and buy it. I painted my room red and White and bought any Southampton I could. Many of my friends supported 'bigger' teams just because they won, I got stick from Chelsea, United, Arsenal fans etc but I didn't care, I was proud to be a Saint even when there was little in terms of quality to be proud of",0,1415205973,null,0,1415206233,0,cltrppj,t3_2lcodt,t1_cltrppj,t3_2lcodt,null,1426178606,5,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,5

One thing to bear in mind as well is that Liverpool is not an attractive place to live. If Liverpool go into a transfer battle for proven foreign talent against a London club like Spurs or another team at a similar level, they will always be more inclined to go for the London club. I love Liverpool as a city but if a foreign player has a choice between Liverpool and an equal London club, for equal money, they're going to London.

We'd gone on vacation to visit family in Winchester and although they weren't big footy fans when I came back I figured I needed a team to support close to my roots. I was in my early teens and although my grandpa had grown up in Portsmouth I couldn't convince myself to support such an awful club. So I found Southampton at a time when Le Tiss was having his swan song, and got to watch the odd match here and there as we battled against relegation with Beattie, Niemi and Claus.

When we finally dropped it went from being difficult to catch a match on tv to extremely hard to follow. I remember bits and pieces, listening to the playoff match our first trip in the Championship, checking in online while travelling in South America to find out we'd lost Theo, but we'd never get a match on tv and people did honestly laugh when I wore my kit to kick the ball around. I remember one pickup game where I knew pretty much nobody and earned the nickname 'Southampton'.

When we were almost wound up it was heartbreaking, but the rebound when Markus scooped us up has been great to watch. When we made it back to the Championship I was able to catch a couple of matches on the football channel we get here, including the derbies (we need a bit of payback...) and Coventry, which was just absolutely amazing. Ah and picking up Le Tiss' signed autobiography in an antique market always cracks me up. I know there's one other Saints supporter here in Edmonton...

Since we've been all the way back up its rare I'll miss a match. I've gone from getting a chuckle when I tell people I support Southampton to being accused of being a glory hunter. And I'll be taking in my first match (or two if we make it to the continent...) during my honeymoon next year.

So Southampton has been a bit of a way to connect with my roots and reject the big boys mentality that so many football fans in North America have.

Group B, on average over the period in question, has been found to yield a significant net fiscal negative to the economy largely due to there being a budget deficit running over the same period.

Group C, on average over the period in question, has been found to yield a larger net fiscal negative to the economy largely due to there being a budget deficit running over the same period.


And the question is: should we change immigration laws to restrict access of Group A in to this country when considering the potential strain additional numbers have on public services.

How do people then draw the conclusion ""Yes we should restrict access to Group A"" when the conclusion should fucking be ""Why are is this net fiscal gain not being spent on improving and expanding public services?""

&gt;

&gt;The __Oxford ""-er""__, or often __""-ers""__, is a colloquial and sometimes facetious [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix) prevalent at [Oxford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University) from about 1875, which is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of [Rugby School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_School). The term was defined by the lexicographer [Eric Partridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Partridge) in his *[Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_Slang_and_Unconventional_English)* (several editions 1937–61).

This is massive hyperbole. As much as our defence is shit, our 13 goals conceded so far this season actually puts us joint 7th best in the league defensively. And I think calling Kolo Toure our ""best defender"" is a bit much when 24 hours ago hardly anyone here would have said so. He had a great game last night, that doesn't instantly make him our best centre-back.

&gt; The money this club has spunked on players is absolutely ridiculous. People wonder why ticket prices are so high and they just need to look at our past few signings for an answer.

You actually been a fan of this club for longer than your Reddit account exists? Do you have no memory of Benitez (who I love, for the record) paying £7m for Dossena, £8m for Reira, £17m for Aquilani, £12m for Babel. Or going back further, £6m for a past-it Morientes, and swapping Owen for only £8m plus Nunez? Or how about Houllier matching our record transfer fee with £11m for Diouf, or £6m (a good chunk of money back in 2000) for Biscan, £3m for Diomede - a goalkeeper who basically never played for us. I could go further but it kind of gets hard to express how much sums of money like £3.4m for Phil Babb (British record fee for a defender) were worth back in 1994. 

I'll ignore the fact that Mignolet, Moreno and Sakho are all very early on in their careers, that Lovren hasn't even been at the club 6 months yet, and that it's still really too early to say the jury is out on any of them. Even without that, pretty much every single manager that has ever had money to spend at a club has made signings that were shit, and not allowing Rodgers the benefit of the doubt when some of his calls don't come off is really harsh.

I love Skrtel, but Toure is a better defender in my view. He is more vocal and handles pressure better, is slightly better with the ball, and is more versatile. Importantly, for BR's style, he can split out to RB when we have the ball better than Skrtel does, who is and will always be a traditional stay-in-the-middle CB - nothing wrong with that, but not what we need at the start of a game when are trying to pass and press.

Apple are /worse/

I was setting up an iPhone that's been passed around a number of people in the business. Apple have put on some arbitary limit on how many Apple ID's a phone can be linked to, and then it just flat out refuses to ever add an Apple ID again (even after wiping it)

Spent hours on the phone, went through their UK and US call centres, got elevated to second line.

They told me to take it to the store, made me an appointment with a ""genius"" they told me to bring ID. Gave them my passport, they wouldn't do it because it was registered to the company (How do you ID a company). They had to get a store manage to auth it.

Had to sit around the store for an hour, did some work on my laptop (non Apple :D)

They come back ""you can now reactivate it"" and started giving me a lecture on how they ""don't usually do this""

In the year 1814, 75% of jobs in the UK were in agriculture. By 1914, only 30% of Jobs in the UK were in agriculture. In 2014 only 3% of jobs are in agriculture. Yet mass unemployment is not a problem, for each job that is lost a new one is invented.

 It reminds me of that quote from Hamlet *There is more in heaven and earth, dear Horatio, than your philosophies can dream of.*

We find it difficult to imagine all the new jobs that shall be invented in the future because they literally exceed what our philosophies can dream of.

All that said, they may well be successful in gaining asylum. We don't know what they've said or if it's true. Nor do we *know* they've been opportunistic. Hypothetical scenario: 

&gt; All 300 are to be repatriated. They're told this by the MOD / Home Office. Other soldiers in Libya email in the UK saying something along the lines of ""Colonel so-and-so is furious at the way the unit behaved in the UK. All 300 are going to be put in military detention by X militia, and beaten as an example to others."" Twenty soldiers, representing the fifteen per cent who *didn't* go round sexually assaulting half of Cambridge, tell the authorities in the UK about the threat. They ask not be sent back. In those circumstances, the authorities will interpret the request as a claim for asylum whether it is so phrased or not. They'll compare it with what they know about prison in Libya.

Such a claim would not be bound to fail, and wouldn't automatically succeed, according to the Home Office's [own guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/351357/CIG_-_Libya_-_Prison_Conditions_-_v1.pdf). It would need anxious scrutiny of whether the threat was real, what conditions would be like in military detention, the nature of the punishment, etc. 

So I don't think it's right to call them opportunistic dickwads *yet*, though they may turn out to be so. They may however be some of the non-naughty soldiers who will nonetheless be beaten shitless on their return to Libya.

Treat your Credit Card like its a debit card / cash. If you have £200 in your debit account, thats the max you should spend on your credit.

I would also reccomend setting up a direct debit account to pay the full amount when the statement is due. 

As someone (18 years old) and no sort of credit history, I managed to get accepted for the Capital One Classic card last week (£200 limit). I intend to use roughly £20-£40 a month on the card and have direct debit set up so i don't have to worry about paying it off. I would be using that £20-£40 regardless if i didn't have a credit card so by having one it will help increase my credit score.

You're looking at a ton of long-term investments that are still years away from maturity and claiming the return on them is rubbish - that makes no sense.

And please name a manager who has spent similar amounts of money and never fucked up in the transfer market. Ferguson spent £45m on Hargreaves and Veron - and only got £15m of that back. He also bought Berbatov for over £30m who was sold on for less than £5m. And he bought Zaha for £15m to then almost never play him and he's been on loan the last two or three seasons. Would you say that Fergie is a terrible manager who never knew what he was doing in the transfer market?

All transfers are a gamble unless you're massively over-paying for someone like Ronaldo or Bale.

We'll have to agree to disagree on this one. No, they didn't just kill everyone but the Daleks in this episode was a little different than usual, the Doctor even says so.

false,iheke,null,null,"I had no intention of going in, on this post but against my better judgment.

1. First, this story begins with why did we buy Paulinho? Basically, this is about AVB and his system (and tangentially Porto). In the all conquering Porto team he had Fernando (Man City), Guarin (Inter) and Moutinho (Monaco) and the ""innovation"" with the way he used this midfield 3 was that Fernando and Guarin weren't your typical DM's that sat but they were ""carriers"" who received the ball deep and carried it forward to feed the inverted wingers (Hulk/Varela) and the CF (Falcao). When AVB arrived at Spurs we had Parker, Huddlestone, Livermore and Sandro (i.e. not one player that could ""carry"" the ball and only have a player that could play the Moutinho passing position at the base - i.e. hudd). So he rolled the dice and bought Dembele in who's unique skill - you guessed it - was carrying the ball. People with long memories will know we were linked with Guarin since forever AVB came through the door that's because to make the system work you needed a second ""scoring carrier"". This was why Paulinho was bought - to carry the ball and to arrive late and score. The last problem to be fixed was the ball playing midfielder at the base, this was supposed to be Moutinho but he was too expensive, so he went to Monaco and we went 2nd choice with Capoue. I still hold to this day that our midfield 3 for 2013-14 was supposed to be Capoue, Dembele and Paulinho - it got a successful run out at Swansea (1 - 0  win, Paulinho goal) then Capoue gets injured at Arsenal and AVB was scrambling to find a balance thereafter until he got sacked.

2. History lesson over, what's going on now? - Simply put, I think that Poch favours ""runners"" over ""carriers"" which explains why Mason is current flavour of the month. I think this may mean have consequences for Dembele. I think that Poch genuinely appreciates the fact that Paulinho has a special skill (i.e. arriving in the box) and that he shoots a lot and scores some - so I have every confidence he'll get a shot.

3. Is he worth £17m? I dunno, I think football transfers work in a strange way, but a couple of data points. In 2012/13 he scored 6 PL goals in 20 games. Eriksen scored 7 in 25, Soldado scored 6 in 29 and Siggi scored 5 in 24. For a 1st season in the PL with his other all round numbers I would say he's good for 10 lge goals from midfield. For context we're a team that scores around 50 goals a season so ask yourself how much should you pay for 1/5 of your production. (ps. in 2013 Confed cup he was the bronze ball - i.e. 3rd best player at the competition behind - Neymar and Iniesta).

4. Quick point on Fatigue. Basically, the guy has been struggling for form at the tail end of Sherwood and then took a pounding in Brazil for their weak midfield (and beasting by Germany). As Poch says he was the last back and he's trying to get him up to speed. Most important is getting back that good form. I find it funny when sensible people are so unforgiving, guy moved to a new club and is on is 3rd manager in a year and you're really wondering why he's struggling to find himself - I think its self evident myself.",0,1415213882,null,0,false,0,cltwcqh,t3_2lcxu4,t1_cltwcqh,t3_2lcxu4,null,1426176374,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

First of all, the vast majority of you were absolutely fine when Siggy left. He was obviously a good player but was never going to be the key player in our side which is what he needs to be. We opted for Eriksen instead and I'm happy with that.

As for Sherwood, don't give me this oh he's English and passionate bollocks. You wouldn't give the job to some random season ticket holder. The bloke was so under-qualified and frequently said inappropriate things in the media. We praise him for playing Benteleb but his main reason for doing this was because he didn't know who Capoue was, hardly an inspired decision when you look at it that way. He dropped Eriksen for no apparent reason and Eriksen clearly thought he was a bit shit. Don't also forget that we had some dire, dire performances eg. Hull away, Liverpool away and West Ham away. Of course, this happens with all managers at some point but for somebody so inexperienced it would've be foolish to keep him on longer.

false,wehaveawinner,null,null,"The article from the site:

Jose Mourinho is no stranger to bold statements but this was a break from the norm. Back in July, in between glowing comments about Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and the rest of a Chelsea squad primed to take the Premier League by storm, he took the time to set out his vision for the future.

Not his own future, mind. Mourinho, judging by everything he has said since returning to Stamford Bridge, is no longer the career-driven gun-for-hire who cut a glorious swathe through European football for the best part of a decade. He is now in the dynasty business, looking to build an all-conquering side around a core of home-grown players moulded by his own footballing principles. And he already knows who they are.“My conscience is simple,” he told Chelsea’s official website. “If, in a few years, [Lewis] Baker, [Isaiah] Brown and [Dominic] Solanke are not [England] national team players, I should blame myself.

“For the first time I have been at Chelsea there is a clear group of four or five players between 17 and 20 clearly identified that we know — unless something happens inside their heads — that have to be Chelsea players.”

Solanke, the youngest of the bunch, made headlines when Mourinho afforded him a second-half cameo against Maribor at Stamford Bridge last month. Nathan Ake, the oldest, made his senior debut two years ago and is now an established fringe member of the first-team squad. Andreas Christensen, a tall, elegant Danish defender, played 90 minutes against Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup, while Baker, Brown and Jeremie Boga are all shuttling between senior training and their respective youth sides.

All have so far been held back from following 26 other Chelsea players out on loan in favour of development league football and more hands-on tutelage with Mourinho and his coaching staff. But those hoping for another glimpse of the future on Wednesday night in Slovenia - even in the form of 20-year-old Kurt Zouma, regarded at Stamford Bridge as ripe for first-team football - could well be disappointed.

Were it not for Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s clinical equaliser at Stamford Bridge in September, Chelsea’s position as Group G winners would already be virtually assured. As things stand, another win in Maribor is required to solidify their supremacy. ""It's always better to play [the youngsters] when the situation is good,” Mourinho told reporters after routing the Slovenians at Stamford Bridge. To his pragmatic eye, it is perhaps not good enough just yet.

Yet there can be no escaping the commitment in Mourinho’s words. While Solanke, Brown, Boga and Christensen are still too young to command significant senior minutes, Zouma, Ake and Baker – scorer of the goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford that clinched the Under-21 Premier League title for Chelsea last season – are very much ready. The Frenchman has been sparingly used, the Dutchman has not been trusted in the Premier League this term and the England Under-20 captain has not featured in any competition.

Cynics will dismiss Mourinho’s worthy public pronouncements as hollow and point to an over-arching reliance on experience in the recipe for instant success that has served him so phenomenally well. The Portuguese would likely point to Davide Santon, Mario Balotelli and Raphael Varane, three teenagers who made their Champions League debuts under his watch, or Carlos Alberto, the 19-year-old Brazilian who started for his Porto side and scored in the final of the 2004 competition against Monaco.

Chelsea’s poor track record in the field of youth development also invites scepticism. The inevitable tension with short-term trophy targets has undoubtedly stunted the growth of several big talents in recent years – most notably Gael Kakuta and Josh McEachran – and necessitated the mass loan system that has proved so financially lucrative and controversial.

Evidence is mounting, however, to suggest that lessons have been learned and the current crop are the real deal. Chelsea have won the FA Youth Cup three times in the last five years, with Baker and Ake key figures in the 2012 triumph and Solanke, Boga, Brown, Christensen and fellow prospect Ruben Loftus-Cheek the spine of the 2014 team. In addition to a NextGen Series final in 2013 and last season’s under-21 Premier League victory, both Brown and Solanke played crucial roles in England’s Under-17 European Championship win last summer.

A talented group is growing together within the collegiate confines of Cobham. Ake and Baker regularly watch their friends in Chelsea’s Uefa Youth League squad along with a small army of club coaches and academy scholars of all ages, while John Terry and Ashley Cole were both seen at Stamford Bridge enthusiastically lending their support during last season’s FA Youth Cup run.

Chelsea is a different club to the one Mourinho left amid bitter acrimony in September 2007. Selling loan prospects has helped meet the initial requirements of Financial Fair Play, but long-term sustainability at Europe’s top table requires the graduation of more than one Ryan Bertrand every 10 years. Fortunately, the raw materials are present to exceed even the most optimistic targets. The responsibility for refining them falls primarily on Mourinho.

“Finally we are having stability, because for quite a long time a manager was not at Chelsea for more than a year and they are leaving by the time they know the name of the kids,” he remarked in August. “Stability helps to get the trophies, not the other way round.”

These are certainly the words of a company man who understands that he will be judged on more than the number of Premier League and Champions League titles he can bring to Stamford Bridge.

But Chelsea’s long-term prosperity rests on his actions following, against Maribor and beyond.",0,1415215697,null,0,false,0,cltxex8,t3_2le1kh,t1_cltxex8,t3_2le1kh,null,1426175881,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Should we lower minimum wage to allow businesses to survive? I mean, your cinema example obviously wouldn't have to lay off half its employees if it only paid half the minimum wage, and that way they can stay open and they'll pay more taxes! You'll also have the employees living off credit and payday loans because its fiscally not possible for them to survive, but oh well, TAXES!

Some people have high wages. Often these are executives and highly-skilled workers, but the point is meaningless, we're talking about the Living Wage, not the average in the nation.

You're not wrong about automation, automation cuts jobs, its true. Has done since the first factory machines began to exist, and will in to the future. This is why people suggest heavier, and more stringently enforced taxes on businesses, to equalise the cost and to allow, for example, for basic income, where everyone would receive the money they needed to live full, happy lives without resorting to credit. We're still a ways off from that point, obviously, automation hasn't managed to replace a burger flipper in a McDonalds yet.

Shaqiri: Would be a huge coup, but he's probably going to a bigger club than ours. (That said I'd love it)

Gayle: Don't know much about him, interesting? I'll research.

Draxler: Schalke is a similar stature to us, and he's one of the most promising players in Europe, but then again we did pull off Lamela from a similar situation (though at a huge cost - one we surely won't be paying over the winter without Bale money)

School uniforms irritate the heck out of me.

For one thing, I don't buy the argument that they hide disparity in income. The rich kids are still going to have the best togs, and the poor ones are going to have hand-me-downs. And most school uniforms require at least one or more hideously expensive items that have to be bought from a specific retailer, such as a blazer or tie.

For another, the argument that it makes them look smart is bollocks. Most workplaces don't have a uniform - instead they have a dress code. If schools want kids to dress smartly, then they can impose a dress code similar to that in most offices. They have absolutely no business specifying school colours or specific items. I'm currently in a job where I can wear jeans, t-shirts and trainers all the time, but in previous jobs I wore black trousers, smart shoes and a shirt or polo shirt. If that's good enough for most workplaces, why isn't it good enough for schools? And the teachers are supposed to be dressed smartly too, but they don't wear the school uniform.

If the pickings become too slim I just won't bid for them, I'd go for private contracts instead.

Whoever does tender for them, they'll be running things on a bare minimum budget to keep costs down. In my experience, whenever that happens, service standards take a dive. It might sound dramatic but that's when people end up dying. We've seen the people dying in hospitals to dehydration because of budget cuts, it doesn't take much for things to turn to shit.

I think the minimum wage is possibly a little low and should be related to the average wages in a given area. I just think it's dangerous in some cases to raise it too quickly. Not everyone in a low paid job sells popcorn. It can have knock on effects in more than one way.

You have to remember, full time employees get 5 weeks paid holiday on top of their wages, the employee pays for that out of its profits. So if you add that onto their wages it increases quite a lot.

Band 1 = the worst
Band 5 = the top marks.

In order to hit Band 5, you must:  
* Fit the criteria for Band 1  
* Fit the criteria for Band 2  
* Fit the criteria for Band 3  
.. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. 

You **will not** get a Band 5 just by simply hitting the criteria for Band 5, because there will be different criteria in Band 4, that won't be mentioned in Band 5.. If that makes sense? 

The great thing about AQA is that you're able to retake the controlled assessments time and time again, given that they're done in proper conditions, and they're sent in time for the deadline for them to be marked. So don't worry about getting 11 - 17, because honestly, you'll have a chance throughout the rest of the year to do better. Practice makes perfect. Eventually you'll get sick and tired of controlled assessment practice and mock exams, but they're honestly **the** best way of improving. Trust me.

One of the good guys (although I bet there are others who will tell you the exact opposite) are American Express.  With me they're less likely to block me generally, they're more willing to take on the risk (which as a credit provider they are doing), and the one time they did they did it in such a smart way I didn't even notice.

I got a letter telling me they'd put a stop on the card, and asking me to get in contact.  The first thing I said was ""err, I used that card twice today, and many more times since that letter was sent.""

They said, ""that's right, we've only stopped transactions above £100 that aren't backed by PIN, so anything you've bought by Chip-&amp;-PIN in person was approved.  There was no need to stop you using your card if you could authenticate yourself with a PIN.""  I thought this was amazingly straightforward that they'd take a different approach to different types of transactions.  But most don't.

I used to have a Barclaycard, mostly trouble free.  But one time I made a slightly above-average internet transaction, the retailer just displayed an unformatted ""500 - Internal Server Error"" screen, it was a Sunday morning, I thought the site had gone down, I gave up and decided to try another day.

The following day, I tried to use the same card in person to buy lunch, ""declined!"" said the cashier with a gleeful look and I ended up paying in cash (I chose the mankiest banknote in my wallet, just for revenge on the cashier being so happy and useless).  Later that afternoon, an automated robe-call I could barely understand asking me to confirm the two transactions.

Now this was a trap.  I had to confirm I had made them, because I had attempted the transactions, it would have been fraud if I had said no.  But by saying yet...

""Thank you, the transactions are now approved."" - what?  I paid in cash for that sandwich!

I got into an argument about it, but they were having none of it.  Telling me I should take it up with the sandwich shop.  Who knows, maybe the sandwich shop handled the transaction wrong, but I still hold Barclaycard responsible for such a colossal balls up even having the potential to happen.

Nothing. But I'd rather take that risk than risk it on a big money signing for players we KNOW won't be good for at least a few years, if that happens at all.

Are you serious? The kid is 21. He's very raw, but he has a lot of potential. Let's look at it in terms of characteristics.

Schurrle is very direct. Great at getting into scoring positions. Good shot on him. Sometimes selfish.
In a match like this, we really don't need a direct attacking player like Schurrle. We need to hold position and slowly carve out chances. Schurrle is liable to screw this up, with his tendency to take egregious long shots and refusal to look for the pass.

false,jbungels132,null,null,"When we attack, the formation would be a 3-4-3, with Capoue dropping between the CB's and the two fullbacks pushing up on either side of Eriksen and Mason. In front of them are Chadli, Kane, and Lamela. Kane, acting as a false 9, is in the middle of and slightly behind the other two, allowing him more space in front of the D. Eriksen and Mason have the ability and creativity to push the ball ahead quickly and with intent. Rose and Walker provide width up the whole length of the field, because Chadli and Lamela are 1) far enough forward to leave plenty of space behind them 2) more likely to play a little closer to the middle, it's just in their nature. However, they'll need to be reminded to leave enough space for Kane. 
On defense the fullbacks would return to their position, Capoue would movore forward, but still in the center of the field between Eriksen and Mason. The two pairings of Eriksen-Chadli and Mason-Lamela on the outside are made because I think the sums of their defensive abilities are the most equivalent. 

Hopefully though, as is the intent, our offensive 3-4-3 would negate the need for this 4-3-3 because we would use our power in numbers to win the ball back high up the pitch. 

I think, with the right nurturing, Kane could be moulded into a wonderful false 9, and one day be a centerpiece of our team. He's got good feet, a very good shot, but most importantly instinct, as the article about him being one of England's top prospects discussed. Chadli and Lamela would play up front, just inside the wide edges of the box. Kane would then play in between them, nestled about ten yards back. This gives him the space for his instinct to make him a serious threat, but at least for a bit nobody would realize it. Once everyone catches on, however, and he gets extra attention from defenses, this will create vulnerabilities for Chadli and Lamela to attack.

A. There are limits on the number of ISA accounts you can subscribe to each tax year. You can only put money into one cash ISA and one stocks and shares ISA.

My understanding is that you can only pay into more than 1 cash ISA per tax year if you do a proper transfer from the old one to the new, and the new one is then, for the purposes of your 1 subscription per year and annual allowance, is the same as your old.

Accused of murdering the three-year-old daughter of a policeman known for his cruelty to prisoners

&gt; Smith was captured in Arkansas and returned as a prisoner by train to Paris. His captors, accompanied by a mob of an estimated 10,000 residents took him from his captors and placed him on a prepared carnival float. They transported him through town and out to the Paris Fairgrounds on the prairie. There organizers had built a lynching scaffold, painted with the word ""Justice"".

&gt; Smith was tied up and tortured for 50 minutes by male members of the girl's family, who thrust hot iron brands into his flesh, from his feet and legs to his head. They included Myrtle's father, uncles, and twelve-year-old brother. A February 2, 1893 article in the New York Sun reported, ""Every groan from the fiend, every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed crowd."" Eventually, the family stuck the irons into his eyes and down his throat.

&gt; Finding he was still breathing, the crowd poured oil on Smith and set him on fire. According to some newspaper accounts, Smith remained alive during the burning.

Of course we will have a larger population, which is good for GDP. Whether the increase in GDP from having more people in the country is so good for quality of life of each person is another question.

Recently I went to Prague and Paris: they seemed unrecognisably empty compared to super-crowded and super-expensive London.  

Is it really in the rest of Europe's interest to have such an asymmetric movement of the young and productive population to the capital city with the common language of English?

I think most of us now see that he is utterly rotten and I don't think I'm the only one amazed that he hasn't been binned out the Celtic first team.

Sacrificing a slot in the national squad for a player who *might* become a regular feature seems a bit daft to me but if you are going to do it, at least pick players who are performing at a higher level.

If MacLeod was producing these kind of performances for Hibs, there's not a chance he'd be in with a whiff of a squad place.

If I was in charge of the national team, I'd actually make it a condition that players will only be considered for the squad if they are playing in the top league of their country. Even though the English Championship is a high standard, it might make players think twice before leaving the Scottish Premiership to go down there which might strengthen our own league setup.

No worries, I am by nature very bloody-minded! I'll also freely admit I was burned somewhat by this issue when I changed schools in year 11 due to a move and had to get a whole new uniform that I wore for a mere six months (not to mention that this was at a time when my father was unemployed). 

To further explain my position, I fully appreciate the arguments that schoolkids should be smartly dressed, but I just don't buy the argument that being smartly dressed requires a uniform. My ideal solution would be for schools to be able to specify a dress code, but not specific school colours or items, so a dress code might be something like:

* Trousers (not jeans, chinos, combats) or tailored shorts
* A shirt or polo shirt (not t-shirts) without any kind of branding or logos visible
* Smart shoes

I really don't see that anything much more than that is in any way reasonable. Most school uniforms are wildly impractical, and I really, *really* don't like ties - it's all too easy to accidentally set one on fire with a bunsen burner. Not to mention the requirements that specific items be bought from certain retailers, who are usually hideously expensive.

Also, IIRC most school uniforms are set pretty much arbitrarily by governors, and often cater to their personal prejudices - look at how many schools have in the past forbidden girls from wearing trousers, for instance.

To me, it's really a point of principle. As I mentioned, the overwhelming majority of secondary schools in the UK do have a uniform, so sending them to one that doesn't have a uniform probably isn't an option (and private schools are probably less likely to not have a uniform). 

I certainly wouldn't want to take that step, but as you said earlier in the thread, if the parents refuse point-blank to cooperate with the school over this one issue but are clearly not just letting the child wear whatever they want and are still ensuring they are smartly dressed, then the school may have little choice but to back down. Deliberate civil disobedience (which is to some extent being deliberately difficult) has proven to be an effective form of protest over laws people consider unjust, and while civil disobedience probably isn't the correct term in this context, I think the same basic idea should apply here in that if one considers a rule to be unjust, one should deliberately and purposefully flout it - if I had a daughter who was sent home from school for wearing trousers I would do exactly the same thing.",0,1415221575,null,0,false,0,clu0yee,t3_2ld0yg,t1_clu0yee,t1_cltz2io,null,1426174204,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Southampton, with their owners and direction now, haven't had a chance to really prove themselves in the market yet.  They've had 2 summer markets in the EPL, and one of those was immediately following promotion.  They didn't exactly have the greatest of player pools to pick from in terms of who they could attract to the club then.

This past summer they were exceptional. Pelle was a good purchase, he's dynamic and powerful, good for the EPL.  Tadic has been a monster in the Eredivisie for some time now and it's actually kind of strange to me that he wasn't scooped up by a bigger club with the sort of numbers he'd been putting up.  Based on this season so far in a much more difficult league his time in Netherlands wasn't really a flash in the pan either, he's incredibly talented.  Alderweireld is another outstanding signing too, I think he was always better than Lovren and that's not just based on how bad Lovren has been for us.  They're getting really good performances out of Bertrand too, Koeman seems to know how to use him to maximize his strengths.  They've made very astute purchases to shore up their problem areas after what they lost this summer.  I don't think they'll sustain their top 4 push, but I wouldn't be surprised at all to see them end in the top 8  or better this season.  You can argue that Koeman just brought in his boys to do the job, and to an extent that's right, but I doubt they'd have gone after these players if they weren't reasonably sure they'd transition and be successful in the EPL.

They don't have a real transfer market history just yet because they haven't been in the EPL in their current state for long enough to establish one.

That means that 8 fought in the War, or that there was a regeneration in between that fought in the War. Fighting in the War, especially to the point of the regret that 9 shows about what happened, would be very out of character for 8, making that scenario less likely overall.

We went for 1 player, Alexis Sanchez (2 if you count Remy, which I guess we should), who is anywhere near similar in charictaristics to Suarez and then just threw our hand sin the air and panicked when he said no.  After that we masturbated a bit and eventually arrived at Balotelli, a player who is the exact opposite of Suarez when it comes to forwards.  There was no way Balotelli would ever fit in with how we played last season, the kind of fast, direct, incisive counterattacking play we were so successful with last season.  It meant we were going to make a huge change to our playing philosophy to accommodate him (or maybe we were going to make it anyway and thought he fit the new style well... but there's an asinine amount of examples out there of how bad Balotelli is as a lone striker so that seems really fucking weird/poorly done if it's the case).

We could have looked at, and gone hard for players like Lacazette, Volland, Son, Icardi, etc.  Players who like to play on their front foot, facing the opposing goal, and with a high tempo.  Those are the types of players that seem to fit in best with what we already have.  We didn't go near any of them after Sanchez/Remy.  They would've been more expensive than Balotelli, but I really don't think the price would've been a stumbling block if it was kept under 30mil (and I think a few of those guys would've been available for under 30mil pretty easily).

You can aruge that Balotelli was meant to play with Sturridge, but that makes the transfer even more baffling to me.  Sturridge has a huge injury history and hasn't shown any kind of signs that he's moving past the kind of frailty he's shown us.  He's going to miss like 1/4 or more of every season.  You have to plan very heavily for the times he's absent and Balotelli is not a good option as a lone striker (and neither is Lambert or Borini for that matter).

Everything is right but the final finish which in a lot of cases was quiet easy. I think we will improve in taking our opportunities over time, but we are laying the groundwork for a great attacking team. It pleases me to see us play this way.

Hazard's penalty was missed and you know if he scored a penalty which you usually expect people to score then we would have won. I can't help but notice that every time he looks a certain way before shooting he goes the opposite way. That's his trick for all his penalties and it will get predictable sooner or later, I think their goalie knew what he would do today. We need to go through different penalty takers or hazard needs to start firing the way he looks at so goalkeepers do not predict what he's done from all his other penalties.

1. Four year pay freeze on a salary which is decent enough for a grad but laughable for anyone who's been in work for more than a couple of years
2. Tight-fisted annual leave and pension provision, more in line with entry-level private sector jobs than grad schemes.
3. It's now run centrally so often FSers are working alongside people who are generally on far better pay and conditions than they are
4. Job changes - including moving around the country - every six months with no control over where you move. It mimics a corporate scheme in theory, but in practice means you never get your feet under the table anywhere. Pick up learning about the agricultural sector and deliver a project in six months, then on to something random like defence. 
6. Lack of departmental embedding - you're only there six months so there's no impetus for them to invest in you as an employee
7. Throughout, be told that you're lucky to be on the scheme, when the one that existed only a couple of years before was much, much better.

And I'm pretty sure Hazard isn't looking in the direction that he's shooting, he's looking directly at the goalkeeper. Thats what commentators have been jizzing about in all his penalties, he doesnt look at the ball he just looks at the keeper and waits for him to make the first move before deciding which direction to put it. Of course this won't always work as we just saw.

The central theme is that incremental change is mostly the refactoring of established theories. However, the important *paradigm shifts* (his term) is that the changes in science are a result of new data not fitting an established theory. The change that occurs when this happens practically destroys the previous established mode of thought.

However, it also appears people's experiences are highly reliant on the quality of advisor they get, the area they live and how they are perceived. Too many people have completely irrelevant job placements foisted on them,  then have their benefits sanctioned if they complain. It's not the same as paid work. JSA is meagre and not liveable on. If they were at least employed in their placement instead of slave labour,  it would be worthwhile if only as a stopgap between career relevant jobs.

I still believe you should be getting at least minimum wage for the work you are doing, as should anyone on an apprenticeship or internship. Our society is built on the notion an individual is paid for the work they do, with very few exceptions.  Replacing actual paying jobs in favour of unpaid placements is such an awful thing and perpetuates the problem.

Mate, if it was this easy then keepers would have picked up on it much earlier.

You really need to deter them from even attempting to steal the bike.

Visible alarm disc locks are great, Xena do a few good ones. Should get a second for both wheels though (thieves seem to be very strong when motivated by cash).

Fitting an alarm/immobilizer is important but I like to look at it as a last resort tool when they have your bike.

The security of the house is important, Millennium burglaries are too common. You can secure your bike with as many locks as you want, but if they have the keys it's gone. It's really important that you make sure doors and windows are locked (a rough estimate of 76% of burglaries are opportunists going through open doors and windows.)

House alarm systems and motion sensitive lights/cameras are great deterrents (make sure you have the lights and if poss cameras on the front and back of your property).

The great thing is the landlord should be more then willing to secure the property with at least the basic kit.

There are far more ways to deter potential thieves, but in the end if they want it bad enough they'll get it. It is not unheard of for gangs to wait outside your house before you go to work and jump you as you get on the bike then ride off with it!

false,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"I highly suggest you read the seminal work by Thomas Kuhn *the structure of scientific revolutions* because it will probably change your opinion completely. Its practically the first text you'd read in a philosophy of science class. It really is a great read and will probably change your perspective on scientific development. Your example of the car is rather limited because its an example of something that hasn't really changed in terms of theory, engineers use mostly the same science as before but there have been larger shifts in other areas like materials science. Scientific revolutions would refer to something like quantum mechanics which just *can't* be explained by Classical mechanics because it literally exists because of gaps in the theory. This is a more than an incremental change, its revolution in thinking, a completely new way of looking at the universe.

Essentially Kuhn's argument is that scientific study will incrementally update an establish theory, but the major paradigm shifts occur when said theory does not fit new data. This is a revolution because it completely changes the way people view some aspect of the universe. The old theories are, essentially thrown away. True scientific change is not the majority of science - it is a very quick explosion in activity that really is something completely different to went before.

This applies very broadly in social constructs too. Before the romantic movement many scholars believe there was very little in terms of projection of ambitions or desires; something we take for granted today.

A more clear cut example is perspective in art - it literally added a new dimension to the way people described the world. This was a revolution. By definition this sort of thing is unpredictable because your current way of looking at the world says, quite clearly what is and isn't possible. This kind of thing would be like a physicist discovering time travel - the old way of thinking would be thrown out the window.

In terms of economic shifts, there is no better example of revolution than the industrial revolution. Literally everything about society changed in an extremely short period of time. You cant put this down to incremental change because it implies some sort of linear passage between events. Looking back this sort of thing seems inevitable, like water turning into ice.

Just hop on the District line (green one) and go to Fulham Broadway - lots of pubs around the exit of the station, you shouldn't have a problem.
It also depends what you're going for, if you want food Bodeans is across the road (and is delicious) but you'll have to wait about 2 hours for a table or book well in advance on a match day.


If you don't want to pay through the nose for a pint but don't mind not actually seeing the game on TV (if there is one) there's a Wetherspoons inside the station/shopping centre bit - just go up the escalator to the second floor. Other than that pretty much every pub in the area has Sky Sports/BT Sport/football channels basically and I'd recommend a pre-kick off drinks/food deal in spoons before heading to a more upmarket place to actually watch the game.

I don't really see my flat as an investment but as a more comfortable and cost effective (as long as interest rates don't sky rocket) way to live. As long as I get my money back when/if I sell it I'll be happy.

Cash holding contains a 4 year ISA earning 4.25% interest which matures early next year.

S&amp;S ISA is with Charles Stanley Direct and mostly invested in Vanguard Lifestrategy 80% fund.

Pension is a company one with Aegon and invested solely in a 40%/60% equity fund.

My other investments are split roughly 50% in Funding Circle (expected return around 6.4%) and 50% in renewable energy co-ops (which get 30% tax relief and are anticipated to earn 4% to 5% interest over 20 years - more of a social investment but hopefully they'll make me some return at the same time).",0,1415226677,null,0,false,0,clu40fw,t3_2l8w5z,t1_clu40fw,t3_2l8w5z,null,1426172778,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

false,xu85,null,null,"Jesus Christ is anyone watching this report on BBC News at 10 by Robert Peston? Classic BBC propaganda. 

Segment starts off with a Polish supermarket asking ""What to make of this new study. What's their fiscal impact""?

*subtext: look at this hard-working entrepreneurial white people starting up VAT-registered businesses. Let's highlight Polish people who have a very good reputation in the UK as opposed to Romanian/Bulgarians, who we also effectively share a border with.*

Next clip is a German explaining how ""Since 2000, immigration from EU has been a net benefit. This is as true for the 2004 A8 countries as it is for the newer EU countries

*subtext: Everybody pay attention to this bespectacled German fellow. Germans are clever, industrious and hard working. Ignore the fact that newer EU immigrants may not be making as great a contribution as the 2004 countries, because technically they are both producing a ""net benefit""

Next clip and we're off to Essex (said with a sneer). Are ""Essex man and woman"" now convinced they're making a contribution? Are they going to remain bigoted xenophobes even in the face of these statistics?

Essex men and woman 1 vote ""no"", those backwards little Englanders. Essex man two in favour of migration, but that's because he works for THE NHS and IT WOULD COLLAPSE if it weren't for migrants. Top lad. Next, 70 year old Brit adamantly against unfettered migration.

Next segment, Narrator Peston on screen saying ""When Jews settle in the East End like my grandparents, there was great controversy over whether they'd be good or bad for Britain. Today nobody doubts the cultural and economic contribution of those immigrants""

*subtext: I'm from immigrant stock, and you all assumed I was a Brit during this piece just like you. Give it 100 years and all immigrants will be indistinguishable from native Britons. 

The man of course is rewriting history to pursue his pro-EU narrative. There were a few tens of thousands of Jews in the East End, the overwhelming majority of residents where ethnic Britons. The only period of ""controversy"" was in the 1930s in the run up to WWII, so 10 years of controversy in 150 ish years of stability and peace. He's assuming because a few thousand jews managed to integrate fairly successfully into British life, a few hundred thousand a year will achieve the same result, even though there's less imperative to integrate if one is surrounded by a large community of people from one's place of origin. Anyway, i'm rambling.. Next!

Tech company in East London. ""How important is it for you to recruit from the rest of the European Union"". Answer from Tech company ""It's incredibly useful to be able to be able to recruit from the EU. Not enough for us to be able to recruit from the UK"". 

Well no surprise their, businesses in favour of EU migration. They can pay 1/2 the wages for a software developer from Latvia so why bother employing Britons? This feeds the perception which filters down throughout society that Brits are plain not worth employing. I mean .. what are the odds a Brit will be best qualified for a job when there is a talent pool of 500M to chose from? Oh wait, it's a two way street, i'm told. OK so Latvians are recruiting from Britain, they have a thriving tech sector in their capital city? They'd feel comfortable employing someone from a country with a higher standard of living? We all learnt Latvian at school, making it a natural destination for finding work? Oh. And it'll only get worse .. this has been happening to the working classes for 30 years and it's starting to hit the middle classes too. That degree you got from a decent uni? There are 100 others with an identical degree from the EU and more of a perceived drive and hunger to succeed. Plus they'll be extremely happy to earn comparatively higher wages. Win/win. Unless you're well connected, happy jon hunting. 

Then with ""But what's good for business isn't *necessarily* good for all of us. Cue 75 year old English man with a RP accent speaking negatively about the rate of migration and whether we can accommodate them all. Old fuddy duddy compared to the young, good looking Tech company girl we just saw .. weird old racist. Also, not **necessarily** good implies it's good for a decent number of people. Well he's right, but says nothing about percentages. If it was good for 5% of UK residents that statement still stands.

At the very end .. ""Prosperity is part of the immigration debate, and maybe some of that has been settled today, but there are much wider questions too about the kind of Britain we want to live in"". What questions? Where's the balance mate .. why no talk of housing problems, tax avoidance, school and hospital shortages. Pro-EU propaganda.

My concern is that if Pearce either gets the sack or leaves, none of this ends well for anyone. A club legend being kicked out of, or choosing to walk away from the club that made him and that he holds incredibly close to his heart, spells disaster regardless. Pearce HAS to get this squad performing again or I think everything will go down the shitter so fast even the rats won't catch a glimpse on the way down. A legend tarnished, an owner who will go down as the man who promised everything and only ended up taking away one of the names we hold dear, a name we proudly pinned up there alongside Cloughie, McGovern, Shilton et al. And if that happens, what will win the fans back over? What will make them turn up on Saturdays and cheer again? What manager will touch us with a barge pole given our track record?

We know Cohen and Andy are incredibly important, Cohen is an absolute machine when he's fit and Reidy has a range and vision of passing rivalled by few in the league - but we have on paper players who can replace them, Vaughan is cool and collected on the ball - we know he can be at least - Lansbury has at points in the past two years picked this sorry mess of a club up and dragged it up the table almost on his own, Paterson, Lascelles and Darlow are, or at least were, some of the brightest young talents in the league and the likes of Antonio and Assombalonga were by far the most terrifying attacking players for all of August and September. Mancienne showed how resolute he can be, a man with Bundesliga experience and energy. We have a handful of fresh from the development squad players itching to have a go. Fryatt, a man we know can bag for fun on his day and who has wanted to join us, and we wanted to sign him, for bloody years. Even fucking Tesche showed he had something to offer when he first had his chance. And yet we see nothing inspiring, no fight, no desire even from those who had little else but desire to give at points, no change in tactics, and the only change I have seen in results is one that also came at the end of Thelma &amp; Louise.

Forest usually start well and then struggle to a finish, but this year the rot has set in deep, and early. We haven't even lasted long enough for the bits to start falling off at the end of January like it usually does. And what's worse is that it's clear we can't ""just hold on"" until the transfer window to regroup and fix key areas, because it's glaringly apparent that the Assombalonga / Lascelles / Darlow transfer shows we're running desperately close to FFP limits and no money can be spent without first shedding something - and we have nothing left to sell that isn't either something we cannot afford to lose, or something nobody will actually pay for.

And this week Mackie and Cox bagged three between them for fucking Reading. Fuck. Me.

I play Seasons for a while every year...it's like a phase...and every time I consecutively get promoted to about Division 2 and then the volume of people who play like complete twats exponentially increases and I lose interest. I'm not a great online player, but I'm by no means terrible.  

I'm not interested in skilling or mindlessly running at people. I'm not interested in playing against people who use players out of position or use wrong formations and shit. I like midfield play, patience, trying to be as realistic as possible, etc. It's hard enough to do that offline in this game, and it's even more obnoxious to do online. The fact that FIFA 15 is even more about dribbling than previous games makes it even harder for me to enjoy. Football is about space and angles and passing and decision making. FIFA is a basketball game with a bigger net.

I've always been the guy who actually punts on 4th down in Madden. Maybe I'm just boring, but it legitimately offends me to see the way people play these games.

The requirements probably are flexible depending on the age and position of the player.

false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Gallifrey itself is not Time Locked. The Time War is Time Locked. Gallifrey is, as of the end of the Time War, in a pocket universe.  

This point in Gallifrey's history was evidently before the time at which it was placed in the pocket universe.  

It must also have been in a ""pre-Time War"" version of the universe, since the adult Doctor would be involved in the early events of that war, and the Doctor always seems to keep time with Gallifrey (see below). As a result this timeline would be ""on the other side"" of the Time War, and with one exception (see below) we have not seen the post-Time War Doctor interact with anyone in the pre-Time War version of the universe, so I think that he would still need to get through the Time Lock to reach this point - and, indeed, get out the other side of it!  

So:  

**How did they get through the timelock?**
The short answer, I think, is that this was a fixed point in time. The young Doctor can remember it happening (though, clearly, he didn’t know the cause), and so, time-lock notwithstanding, it had to happen.  

In this respect, this incident can be likened to the meeting of Davison and Tennant in *Timecrash*, which is the only other time (apart from the business with the Moment) that the post time war Doctor has encountered anyone (in this case, himself) from the pre-timewar universe (i.e. anyone who, if asked, would be able to say that Gallifrey and the Timelords were still around). In Timecrash unlike any other multi-doctor meeting that we have seen on TV, Davison, the younger Doctor, evidently remembers the event. Tennant says that he knows what to do because he remembered it as Davison. He could remember, in that case, because that too was a fixed point in time, I’d say.  

So if we accept that fixed points like this can over-ride or bypass the time-lock, then that part makes some sense.  

**How then did they get into Gallifrey’s past?**  
Up until the time war, it seems pretty well established that the TARDIS kept time in pace with Gallifrey. If 10 years passed in the TARDIS, then 10 years passed on Gallifrey too. However, with Gallifrey gone (either destroyed, or in the pocket dimension), there would be no Gallifreyan time to keep pace with. As a result, I think that this has allowed the TARDIS to take them to that point in the past (or any other point, assuming that they would be able to bypass the timelock again), since the two have been dis-connected. Should Gallifrey return, I expect that the timeframes will link up again.

See: [Allotment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotment_\(gardening\)). Small patches of land you can apply for and rent for the use of growing fruit, veg, or in some cases just whatever takes your fancy. They became particularly popular in built up cities where peoples' homes often didn't have the space to grow anything, or even space at all. And of course crucial during the war to keep up supplies of fresh fruit &amp; veg.

Though UK allotments look much less like the pretty pictures in the Wiki article and much more like the sort of ""thrown together from bits of rubble and caravan, possibly with some fruit &amp; veg growing"" thing you see in OP's pic.

History changes slowly and incrementally.

&gt;An __allotment garden__ (British English),  often called simply an __allotment__, or a __community garden__ (North America) is a plot of land made available for individual, non-commercial gardening or growing food plants. Such plots are formed by subdividing a piece of land into a few or up to several hundreds of land parcels that are assigned to individuals or families. Such parcels are cultivated individually, contrary to other [community garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_garden) types where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people.  In countries that do not use the term *allotment (garden)*, a community garden can refer to individual small garden plots as well as to a single, large piece of land gardened collectively by a group of people. The term *[victory garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_garden)* is also still sometimes used, especially when a community garden dates back to World War II or I.

I remember the wietpas arguement well, I ended up booking a trip over a month before it was due to come in because it would be the ""last time"", a week before I went over it was all cancelled! 

Its even more political here but its under the guise of mental health problems that are associated with cannabis. You (and most people on this subreddit) know the arguments for and against, but mental health was the major stumbling block for the cannabis regulation bill down south and the recent westminster debate brought forward by the Green Party. ""What if x% of *young people* develop mental health problems?"" was what won the prohibitionist argument down south as well as party whipping, Ming did fuck to argue against it on Vincent Browne even when VB himself steered the argument against prohibition. I've worked with drug users of all sorts, people addicted to opiates, alcohol, benzos, and cannabis, there is an element of addiction but we need to show the difference between physical addiction and mental addiction. Weed can be addictive as in a tiny element of our population use it to block out trauma. In America they see it as cheap medicine, and because we have the NHS that argument just doesn't work. 

US States are voting for legalisation, the US leads the war on drug, the federal government cant fight it anymore. I don't know if the UK will follow. The rest of Europe are steering in that direction too, the Dutch had just provided a half hearted model for doing it but its not the best model. Only the UK, France and the south still think locking up people who smoke grass as the best option. What they're really doing is creating a new generation of people exposed to the criminal justice system. 

Cannabis has been one of the most positive influences on my life. I wouldn't have studied for a masters degree without it, I didn't have the motivation but Cannabis gave me that motivation, and I wouldn't be working with drug addicts if I didnt know how to work *with them* instead of against them without my knowledge of drugs, how they work, what they do and how theyre sold without doing it myself in one way or another. Alcohol is by far the most dangerous and life shattering drug I have come across in my experiences.

It's easy to say this, but the people who are saying that 4th isn't realistic for a while, they're completely right IMO. 

When you look at the teams above us in terms of finance-Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, City, United (even with no CL, they spent 200 million no problem!)- we're behind. That's five teams, and barring Liverpool because I think we're going to be a realistic competitor of perennial CL spot contenders. 

It's not pessimism, it's looking at the current landscape and seeing what's there-we're fucked financially. City and Chelsea can just revamp their squads on an annual basis if Pelligrini or Mourinho doesn't like them. To put it into perspective, we didn't go in for Schneid because he was 15 million over what we valued him at. That's nothing for Mansour or Abramovich.  

That's not to say that I'm cynical about our future-we've got a fairly young core of players, a young manager who will learn and grow with us, and all signs point to Levy backing Poch.

What this means is that when the Doctor travels, he seems rather fuzzy on details of actually targeting anything(he might get the decade wrong, and might be off by couple hundred miles), but he can always get rather good guess on what he can expect from the trip, which would be pretty much impossible if his time travel was based on ""set location + date and go there"".

It was hinted in Doctor's Wife that Tardis does required calculations + planning.

Further, it has been shown that Doctor himself doesn't really have any clue of who is calling him, or from which time is that call coming from. These calls seem to mostly fit in time travels the Doctor makes, but as River Song demonstrated, this is not really a necessity. There doesn't really seem anything particular keeping these events in sync.

I feel it should be mentioned that human-like time travel, which has been shown to be invented like 3000 years from now, seems to be working based on very linear model of time. It's my impression that the reason humans from that far in the future don't go traveling with Tardises of their own is somehow tied to this less psychic nature of time travel humans use, but I really don't have a clue why time lord psychic time travel is so much better.

And of course the Doctor doesn't want anyone to die. He, at all times, wants no one to die.

I think, and the most recent episode only reaffirms my belief, that he masquerades as apathetic, but he's actually more empathetic than he's ever been.

He knows that Clara is hurting as soon as she walks into the Tardis, but he doesn't know why. He understands that she's desperate and very much wanting to lash out, and most of all he understands how badly she wants to control what's happening to her.

He uses all this against her to help her, and then, he handles her grief better than Eccleston did, better than Tennant did.

* Enjoyed huge early success in their original incarnations

* Unafraid to change lead actors and creative directions to keep the series going

* Second success peak in their '70s incarnations (Roger Moore and Tom Baker)

* Decline in the '80s, both airing their final installments in 1989

* Attempted revivals in the mid-90s (Goldeneye and the TV movie)

* A new, wildly successful incarnation with the geek renaissance of the '00s (Rose in 2005, Casino Royale in 2006)

* And still riding that wave, with Skyfall and Series 8 being two of the most popular and critically acclaimed pieces that either property has ever put out

Lansbury's been appalling since he signed his new contract, Wilson often looks clueless at the back and Newcastle must desperately want a refund for Lascelles. Other than that though, I genuinely cannot understand what has gone wrong. Huddersfield for instance we spent the entire match camped in their half and they sojourned into ours three times and managed to score each time. We're still playing some good football, but there have been too many individual lapses that have lead to sloppy goals - I can't think of many that we've conceded recently which have resulted from fine play by the opposition as opposed to moments of our own ineptitude. Lichaj's backpass tonight, Darlow missing a punch against Blackburn, not to mention all the opportunities that have been squandered by the opposition when we've blindly let them through.

That said, I am very disillusioned with Psycho ATM. The team selection and setup tonight was frankly disgusting. Why pay so much for Assombalonga and then bench him? This is in top of the fact that he persists with playing Assombalonga on his own up front - already quite a cynical and negative tactic - when to me it's quite clear he benefits from having someone up with him. The Blackburn game last week will go down for me as one of the biggest managerial disasters of recent memory - though we weren't dominating them by any means we were at least comfortable, and then he decided to make stupid substitutions, bang Fryatt out on the wing and drop Lansbury back and the next thing we know we've conceded three goals in ten minutes. 

Confidence is clearly low and communication seems to have broken down also. So many times we see players try passes that simply are not there. Though I was complaining about Reid at the start of the season because he was nowhere near his best, it's a figure like him we really require at the moment because as it is, though central midfielders like Vaughan, Tesche and even Osborn may have solid games, they don't grab control of the whole midfield like Reidy does.

When people including Rodgers talk about the balance players like him bring to the side it's not vague either, he has a good tactical brain and knows how to control the tempo of a match. Joe has his limitations; he could be more physical but he is a good presser of the ball, he is either on or off his passing game but he can be excellent, he could definitely score more, but he was an important part of the cohesion we had last season because he set the tone Rodgers was trying to spread through the squad. Regardless of his place in the squad now, (which I would argue is as an important player for us) he already has had a big impact on the team and shouldn't still need to prove himself or be ""given opportunities"". He's played for us 71 times. 

Who are you comparing him to in terms of Champion's League teams? The likes of Pirlo, Kroos, Alonso? We aren't close to those players' teams across our entire squad, if you're condemning Allen and Borini for not being on their level you should say the same of Skrtel because he's not on the level of Varane or Mascherano, Coutinho because he's not as good as Iniesta. Those types of players once they're established will only go to the top clubs, and realistically we are not one of them (in terms of results in recent years). The only way we get players like them is developing them ourselves or getting them while they're young and still something of a risk. Borini was one of those, whether he pays off is still to be seen. Allen will never be on the level of some CL teams midfielders but he is a solid player and we still need those if we want to compete in the CL *at all*.

Phil Jones is pretty handy (in no way worse than Kaboul I would say), Rojo carried Argentina to the World Cup final with some very good performances, Shaw is miles better than either Rose or Davies, and Blackett actually looks a decent young talent, on par with at least Dier I would say.

Vertonghen and Walker are the only defenders of ours I would say are better than any of theirs, and Walker has been out for so long, who knows if he'll come back on top of his game this season?  Vert has been patchy over the last 18 months, and if he and Kaboul/Fazio get injured, we're pretty much as threadbare as Utd have been lately.

I mean... would you honestly not swap squads with them?  They have huge weaknesses in defence, but so do we.  Whether it's more due to talent or defensive organisation is irrelevant at this point... we've sure been on the end of some spankings lately.

A bad defence can lose you games, but only by scoring goals can you actually win games.

We loaned him for a reason, after all.

2) why don't we ever play a 4-4-2 with both eto'o and lukaku starting up front for some games - maybe I haven't watched close enough, but I haven't seen it this season.  Seems like it'd be a potent combination, so is this just for the sake of keeping both strikers as fresh as possible?

false,Oliwri,newcr-1,McCxrthx,"1). Honestly from what I've seen Atsu hasn't been too great. I agree he could be a decent attacking spark but he's gotta make an impact in the limited time he's given before Martínez will trust him to change a game ahead of someone more established like Pienaar or McGeady. I think with a run of appearances Atsu could pick up some decent form, hopefully at least. Especially with Mirallas out. 

2). A 4-4-2 like that would mean going without the central attacking midfield position which is one of our most important with Barkley and Naismith both operating best from it. It also means in order to keep Ross on the pitch we'd have to put him in the holding midfield role which he isn't nearly as effective in and he just can't provide enough cover for his partner in a two man midfield. The only formation I believe would get the best out of Eto'o, Barkley and Lukaku is a 4-1-2-1-2 or a 4-4-2 diamond with Barkley playing behind the two strikers being backed up by two defensive midfielders and an anchor man. We'd have a much weaker wide presence without proper wingers but that's where our magic fullbacks come in and our anchor man can drop in to cover. Not having wingers wouldn't be a huge issue for us at the moment as our main game changer out wide, Mirallas, is injured. If done properly the 4-4-2 diamond could also get naismith, with Barkley dropping deeper as the anchor man's presence would minimise his defensive responsibilities considerably.

I do very much agree that Lukaku and Eto'o being played together up front would be a fantastic sight to see. ",0,1415245573,null,0,false,0,cludpyb,t3_2letad,t1_cludpyb,t1_cluddwv,null,1426168164,7,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,7

* The Plague Doctor - The Black Plague as a rogue Silurian attempt to wipe out humanity. The Silurians pose as plague doctors to spread the disease and collect specimens for experiments.
* The Monster of Legend - The Doctor meets Beowulf and Grendel, but the hero turns out to be the monster as Grendel is just a stranded alien. 
* The Space Zoo - Exactly as it sounds. The trio encounter an extraterrestrial zoo that holds the last of millions of species from around the universe. Earth has its own wing, as there have been numerous extinction events as well as species wiped out by humans. Of course the curators want the Doctor as one of their exhibits. 
* The Doctor in Wonderland - (As I just described in another thread.) They meet Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll, but the characters of Wonderland are coming to life. Alice's cat Dinah turns out to be the Cheshire Cat, a psychic alien parasite that feeds on imagination and excretes mass hallucinations. 
* Family Reunion - It's been over 50 years since the human race defeated the Daleks, and Susan Campbell has led quite a life since then. She's raised a family, worked for both Torchwood and UNIT, and watched her husband die. Now she herself is on her deathbed... when she hears the familiar sound of the TARDIS. Reunited with her grandfather, Susan faces a difficult decision: Will she regenerate and return to the TARDIS, or will she die as she lived, as a human. (Spoiler: Over the course of the episode, her son is shot by a rogue Dalek and she gives up her remaining regenerations to save him.) 
*  Happy Anniversary - When the TARDIS lands in 1925 Coney Island, the Doctor and his companions enjoy a much needed holiday. But suddenly a time traveler with a vortex manipulator lands next to him in the Tunnel of Love and whispers ""Hello Sweetie"" in his ear and kisses him. As they come out of the dark tunnel, the see each other in the light and both scream. (Roll opening credits.) Oh, and the clowns are nightmarish ghouls who abduct children and feast on their fear. 
* Shadow of Death - Salem, Mass. 1998. Paranormal investigators are going missing in a graveyard while investigating reports of ""shadow men"". Upon investigation, the Doctor discovers them to be a new evolutionary stage of the Vashta Nerada. 
* Kaiju - A giant alien monster attacks 1950s Tokyo.
* Devil's Triangle - Ships and planes aren't the only things drawn to the Bermuda Triangle. When the TARDIS crashes there, they find a mysterious spacecraft. It's Lovecraft meets Daleks.

1. The UK and France go to war (for the 239874209347th time ever) because Napoleon is generally a prick.
2. The US trades with both countries at the time, so the UK starts to [impress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment) US sailors.
3. Americans are pissed, so James Madison drags his 40kg balls and demands that congress to declare war on the United Kingdom(!).
4. The US loses embarrassing engagements for nearly 2 years and the British burn the American capitol city.
5. America figures out that everyone's left Canada to either fight Napoleon or invade New England, so they cunningly try to invade Ontario with moderate success. This results in a more even stalemate for the final 6 months of the war.
6. In December 1814 everyone **literally** pretends like nothing ever happened after signing the [Treaty of Ghent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent).
7. Andrew Jackson kicks some serious ass at the [Battle of New Orleans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans), which just so happened to commence the day before the Treaty of Ghent was signed.

* why it took exactly 66 seconds
* why it was only visible to one person at a time 
* why you couldn't out run it and walls/doors wouldn't stop it.

My theory is that he is a timelord or is somehow affiliated with them as is trying to bring gallifrey back into the third dimension. Mummy on the orient express isnt the only episode either where some hidden group is trying to understand dimensions either. In ""flatline"" there are 2d monsters that are trying to access the third dimension too and in both cases  it seems both with Gus and the 2d monsters there is the sense that they are trying to learn about and understand dimensional travel. 

*We know gallifrey exists again and his hidden in a painting somewhere but there has been no mention of it at all this season even though it was revealed to have returned in the 50th anniversary. 

*we also know that there is Gus who wishes to remain unknown and is very powerful and intelligent but despite this seemed unable/unwilling to interact directly with the mummy. 

*And we also know that there exists a race of 2d beings that want to understand how the 3d works and want to enter our works (which is exactly what i imagine gallifrey wants to do too). 

*And finally The Master's last ark ended with him jumping into a portal to gallifrey and to have him show up now at the end of the season means there will likely be an explanation as to how he returned/regenerated and how he escaped from gallifrey. I dont believe we will see much if any of gallifrey this season due to how close we are to the end now but i do think it will be a large part of the next season.

I believe that regardless of who he is Gus will be affiliated with gallifrey.

The ""Arab Spring"" - as you call it - achieved nothing in any of the countries it effected, except Tunisia.  However that doesn't justify standing idly by as people get massacred - which they would have been in Libya just as they are in Syria.  Infact leaving the Syrian war carry on as it has only made terrorists stronger and the war to spill out into Iraq and Lebanon.  Imagine the size of the terror networks we'd have if Libya was left to turn into another Syria.  Thank goodness we didn't have liberals calling the shots back then!

The world isn't as simple as you like to imagine it.  Just because a Bush style intervention caused havoc, to then turn into a passive country and refuse intervention all together is only going to make things worse in the long term when terrorists start targeting civilians within the UK or other civilised countries - as they already have.  Your being reactionary and allowing Syria to go on has already blown up in everyone's faces.  

I'm not saying I know what the right intervention would be, you need a strategist for that, but pretending you're being peaceful by turning your back on a massacre is typical liberal behaviour and complete bull shit.
