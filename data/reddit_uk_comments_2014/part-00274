true,Piqsirpoq,null,null,"Realistically, many UK police officers will have trouble controlling a person who really fights back... **and** if caught off guard. A police officer is significantly hampered down by guidelines on the use of force - and rightly so. Police officers have to refrain from many effective moves that risk injury to the other person (choking, punching etc.). 

For example, that neck throw by the kid would've been rather iffy if done by a police officer. Although, it may be best for society if we discourage neck throws by our police force.

*Obviously*, a gender difference exists, but not to a degree where female police officers are unfit for duty. Sadly, most police officers in the UK are unfit full stop. At the same time, however, it should be borne in mind that the ability to violently control people is just one aspect of policing. Granted, it is one of the core aspects. Personally, I feel that we shouldn't have overweight police officers on field duty. 

It is a sad reality that those who enjoy and excel at violent confrontations are generally not the best personality type for police work. Some of those types still slip through, though. Unfortunately, they tend to dole out their punishment too eagerly. Then we cry police brutality.

Credible claims can be accepted as default, and modified if new information arises relating to that claim. Someone claiming to have held a skilled but reasonably common job in the past, when they now hold an unskilled job in a different country to where they grew up, is making a credible claim. It might not be true, but there's no specific reason to think it isn't true until new information arises.

With incredible claims, existing knowledge can be used to rule out claims because they do not make sense from the outset.

In this example, ""the lovely African fellow assured me he was Jesus Christ with a drink problem"" is easy to disprove because everyone knows deities can't get drunk. Or was that supersoldiers? Or maybe that's what he meant by drink problem, like wotsisface in Airplane!...

Ramires seems like he's going to be used mostly in the 3. Fabregas looks most effective in the 3 so that probably does give Baker more of a chance if we keep playing with 3 but I wouldn't be surprised if it meant we play with Oscar deeper when Fabregas is injured. Although I agree Baker is probably a good option, but I'm not really talking about complete rotation or backup. Baker is a back up for that position, and he probably does have a good chance of getting games.


I also see your point about the AMs being more stacked. But the point I'm trying to make is that Boga offers something different that probably only Hazard offers in making runs with the ball that pulls several players out of position. I don't see too many other of our AMs offering that apart from Willian but not to as much of a degree. He thrives on the stretched games. Boga and Hazard can work in very little space and maintain the ball. It seems like that is quite important to our play in terms of allowing passes to be into players in space. As a result you'll see Hazard has created a lot of confusion before a lot of our goals. If this is so vital I'm suggesting Boga as I'm not sure we'll be as effective without him. That's my argument to him getting a game really. I'd rather test that against a shaky defence and in a case where I can see Hazard being rested before City.

Lovren has made an underwhelming start, however I think this might have more to do with us than his actual performance. He's been okay. Not great, just acceptable. And therein lies the problem - because our defence was so diabolical last season and arguably cost us the title, we built Lovren up as the saviour - the man who would pick up his hammer and nails and singlehandedly board up the goals and keep any opposition at bay for us. And that isn't going to happen any time soon. 

I think we need to calm down and remember that yes, he has been here a while now and he knows that Škrtel is on his way back and Kolo Touré is more than capable of pinching his spot.

Usually I would follow a logic like this:
 toothpaste: Buy a main brand when they're on 2 for 1 at Tesco or Boots and not ridiculously expensive. The way I see it, I use toothpaste at such a slow rate (what, it's probably three tubes a year? Maybe?) that there's little point in deliberating over brands and having my annual spend by £2 rather than £4. Get something with whitening or sensitive or long-lasting and then head to the till.

shampoo: tricky, requires comparison of offers in the supermarket and the 99p shop.

cloths: Probably a cheap shop/99p shop. For floor-cleaning cloths, check if you've got a t-shirt you never wear (Suffolk folk festival '06 or something). Cut it up, use that to clean the bathroom. Not so classy for leaving by the sink.

cling film: Buy supermarket own-brand, or massive discount store brand (£2 or so for 4x as much. Cheap cling film can be thin and non-sticky, so you have to use more.

Shallow note: Buying Tesco-value home cleaning products is fine. Buying Tesco-value personal cleaning problems is less impressive. Having a date come back to your place and seeing that all of your shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair gel and toothpaste are own-brand may make you look *cheap* rather than *frugal*.

Definitely. Nobody wants Scotland to crash and burn. Nobody is that mean or vindictive.

But there are still many issues which will get nasty IMO. The UK doesn't want currency union, but probably wouldn't sacrifice its own economy to deny one. However, the rUK government *can* block Scotland from joining the EU, or at least levy it as a threat to get a better deal in other areas. And is Salmond thinks they can walk away debt free, I don't see the rUK government (or British public) accepting that for even one millisecond. 

Plus a whole load of little things. For instance, the rUK government would have no incentive to participate in helping Scotland set itself up as a competitor with lower tax rates than us. And the rUK government won't feel the need to help with jobs in Scotland, so I think they would relocate government jobs to the UK pretty quickly.

As far as I can tell, the rUK government would have a significantly more powerful negotiating position.

Are you getting the 15% figure by taking 25% off of 20%? That's not how it'll work.

When putting your money in, it's reclaiming the tax you'd pay so you get the full 20% benefit. When withdrawing it, all your income is taxed just as it is now. That means that if you withdrew £20k a year, your effective tax rate would be 10% (the first £10k is tax free).

&gt; Have I got it right that the pension tax benefits aren't that great? If correct, the greater flexibility of my own savings seems like a better option.

They're better than you think, but it isn't an obvious win over an ISA. The flexibility is a significant bonus. Mostly the tax incentives on pensions become much more attractive for higher rate taxpayers though.

It goes to show that when a significant number of people want something, it CAN happen. And really that's true in England or the UK just as much as it is true in Scotland. But in this case, it's easier in Scotland since there is one single, very simple question to rally around. If you look at no voters or yes voters, many of them find many different reasons for their position, but they can all unite around either ""yes"" or ""no"". That isn't so applicable to any other issues (lets say benefits, or internet privacy, or military intervention) where there are more grey areas and differing opinions and complicated answers prevent people from rallying easily.

As an English guy, I can't deny that Scotland needs more powers to govern itself. Clearly the demographics, culture and physical realities of the country (low population density, having oil money etc) have different requirements to large cities in the South East of England which concentrate in different industries. It's obvious to me that one size doesn't fit all. So from my point of view, the best solution would be more powers for the Scottish parliament and greater autonomy. That makes perfect sense to me. To me, leaving the UK altogether just seems like a move of total last resort once all other options are exhausted. But I don't think all other options have been sufficiently explored. The ""better together"" campaign have done a terrible job overall, but they *have* put another option on the table now (albeit last minute because they are morons), promising extra power to Scotland in the event of a ""no"" vote. If I was Scottish, I would vote no and take that deal. I would want more say over my own country but I wouldn't want the uncertainty, turmoil and potential isolation of leaving the UK. 

The UK is not perfect at all, but it is one of the greatest places in the world to be born, live and work. Our politicians can seem like total wankers, but I don't think they are really evil or trying to hurt anyway, and the UK still becomes a better and better place every year. I am totally proud to be British, and I think the UK as a whole, including Scotland, would suffer greatly from splitting apart.

Taken from [Audit Scotland](http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2011/nr_110825_scotlands_public_finances.pdf)

""The financial challenges facing the Scottish public sector are well documented. In October 2010, the UK government outlined spending reductions in almost every area of the public sector over the next four years. As Scotland receives most of its funding from the UK government, the reductions will have a significant impact on the amount of money available to the public sector in Scotland. The Scottish Government estimated in October 2010 that its budget for day- to-day spending and running costs will fall by £3.3 billion in real terms (11 per cent) from £29.2 billion in 2010/11 to £25.9 billion in 2014/15. The overall decrease is most pronounced in 2011/12 as the budget falls by £1.7 billion in real terms (six per cent) to £27.5 billion.""

Long term I think this will be the making of Scotland, home of Adam Smith and modern economics. 

As a nation it has such huge, evident potential once it throws off the contextualised noose of British socialism. With persistent instability in the world, and Europe in particular, being outside the UK and Europe could see Scotland become a safe haven for capital too, while maintaining the pound.

We need to find the right combo of centre halves and stick with it. Personally I think its Skrtel-Lovren.

Intensity. Right now its missing. Whether thats because Studge isn't in the team, I'm not sure. But we need to rediscover it and play with tempo. Things are too slow and without speed - which was the epitome of our play last season. Find that intensity and we'll do well.

For example this is what Chaplin said:

Heyman states, and you can see the omission:

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on JSA so sanctions will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey. There are unemployed who are not entitled to JSA (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are arguably people on JSA who are not unemployed (i.e. fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not measured, however there is some measure of “underemployment” in that those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work are recorded. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately, so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time. It is for this reason that I have rounded the above table to the nearest thousand this month.

As it’s a topic which nearly always comes up in the comments I’ve  included wage data for the first time this month. As far as I can see these data are not adjusted for inflation, so I’ve had a go at doing that myself, rebasing historical numbers to show their equivalents at today’s prices. 

Items highlighted with * have more recent data available (i.e. for August, not July), so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

Edit: thanks for the gold! I've made this post a bit of a hobby and tried to improve it every month. I'm glad people appreciate it. Any recommendations for additions (and indeed subtractions, it's getting rather large) gladly received.

Additionally, I shouldn't have to point out the flaw in your logic about MAD. Game theory reaches far in to economics as well as political science, and there is such a thing as peer review. Nash isn't the only person to have worked on it.

That's an illusion, the differences are extremely minor. There are far greater differences between age groups than differences between regions of the UK.

You can say you're using common sense and go on the pavement when you feel it's safe but imo all that does is give anti-cycling types reasons to complain and be upset, they won't agree it is safe under any circumstance and all you're doing is making cyclists look bad.

The same reason the UK wants Scotland to stay and makes the uk better ""with"" than ""without"" is the same reason scotland is much much bleaker on its own.

You cant realistically think you removing 10% of something is a legit cause for the UK to be scared and then ignore the fact you are losing 90% of something and think it isn't equally applicable and magnified.

I think that's a little optimistic. 2 months to be better at weight lifting than men? That'd be quite possible.. Because it can be quite technical. 

I don't think that actually makes them stronger, though. Same reason I can bench and squat more than some of my friends who are undoubtedly stronger than me in general. They just don't lift..

If the uk and scotland where two businesses it makes no sense for the uk to help out scotland, instead it makes more sense to lower prices and drive your competitor underground buy up its assets and then carry on as normal.

If scotland has anything the UK wants or needs its in the uks interest to allow a state to exist where scotland is more desperate than the uk.

In the same way if you wanted to sell more than i wanted to buy, who do you think gets a better deal? 

The UK can afford to take a hit, scotland cant, so ultimately in a game of economic chicken the UK wins.

Every threat or non compliance scotland does against the UK hurts scotland more than the UK, so its like two neighbours involved in a dispute and one hacking off their limbs to throw at the other, yes both are worse in that situation the neighbour gets damaged by being hit and injured by these limbs being thrown but the other neighbour is being devastated and crippled.

Its the entire principle of competition, the uk has more cards to play and is in a stronger position, yet you think they will cave because they are vulnerable to small fluctuations, yet scotland who is massively vulnerable to any fluctuations will outlast or out compete their competition?

Scotland is negotiating from weakness, it wrongly believes that having its views and desires listened too and catered to by the union because it was the union, is applicable when its out of the union, big mistake.

I picked the deadlift for a reason. You can't fake a deadlift. The technique ensures you don't kill yourself doing it but whatever you can lift is whatever you can lift. Technique doesn't really give you a tremendous strength advantage (in this lift at least). It gives you an advantage in not gaining a broken back.

80kg isn't that high (but it is surprising just how many men couldn't do it). You cannot even perform a deadlift properly without 60kg on the bar unless you have spacer plates.

As for the cyclist/pedestrian angle you mention, I agree that some cyclists take the piss, any rational cyclist would agree that there are some who do and they ruin it for the rest. I think what some people forget is that we are all pedestrians at some point in the day, all cyclists and all motorists are also pedestrians.

If Gallifrey was Time Locked across all of space and time this would not be possible. So only Gallifrey post Time War is locked so the Doctor cannot visit it now since he himself is post Time War but he can travel within his own timeline to visit it in his own past, but as we know this is ""potentially catastrophic"".
The Doctor could not be outside the Time Lock if his own past on Gallifrey was Time Locked. Crossing your own timeline is possible, just dangerous, and I think it would be too painful for the Doctor to visit his own past if there was no way to save anyone. Anything he would do to change his own past with the Time Lords could have disastrous consequences for the present day.
The Time War happened across all space and time but it did not happen across the Doctor or any other Time Lords entire timelines (otherwise we would have known about it from the start) so although to the universe, Gallifrey and the Time Lords no longer exist, from the Doctor's frame of reference they still exist in his own past.""

And this one was from someone called ""AwwComeOnNow"":

""You're confusing the Time Lock with moving the planet. The Time Lock is in place to keep people from time traveling in and out of the Time War. This was necessary with a war between 2 time traveling species. At the end of the war, The Doctors broke through the Time Lock using the moment, and with all 13 Tardises, transported the planet to a pocket universe, LIKE capturing it in a painting. Not actually putting it in a painting.

We are much better with 2 up front - Borini caused problems and with Moreno and Manquillo crossing into 2 strikers instead of 1 we looked a lot more dangerous against Ludogorets.

Coutinho has been poor (not entirely his own fault as he has been hounded by opposition players relentlessly) and this would be a good opportunity to give him a rest without compromising team quality.

Gerrard (if fitness allows) and Hendo (fitness allows) pick themselves in that formation.

Very happy with the defence at the moment, both full backs improved on and I think Lovren is starting to prove me wrong (I originally thought he wasn't worth £20m).

Mignolet was one of the players at fault for the Ludo goal but with no acceptable alternative he will have to play again.

Baines and Coleman should be higher. I try not to be biased but they're probably the best full backs in the league. Coleman was probably our best player last season, especially going off all the end of season awards he got. 78 is far, far too low.

I would have thought Lukaku would be higher, he surely has proven his worth with us last season and West Brom the season before. I'd say around 82 at least. 

Mirallas is an odd one, he wasn't too consistent last season, but on his day he's easily our best player technically. I'd give him 81 or 82.

McCarthy was awesome last season, he should be a 1 or 2 points higher in my opinion. With a high potential too. (Surely he has to have an Engine trait too, the lad doesn't stop running.)

Barkley should be way higher in my opinion, he's a young player and had a bit of a lapse half way through last season. But other than that he's been ridiculously good for both club and country. I feel like 78 is way too low, I expect his potential to be very high though.

Naismith should be a little higher, last season he was great and this season he's even better it seems. His work rate alone should get him a 92 overall. They call Messi the Argentianian Naismith right? 

Stones 72 is crazy low, again as with Barkley he's young and sometimes makes mistakes. Though virtually every game he's player he's been ace. Surely he has to be higher than Alcaraz at least? His potential should be very high, and his overall at least 77 I think.

I'm very excited about Besic and Oviedo, I think think both should be a tad higher. But it makes sense they're quite low as we haven't seen a great deal of them yet.

  So, long ago in the mists of time almost forgotten in the haze of time passing in my 20s, I was a student in Central London. I would very often finish around lunchtime. Often I would then toddle off to Nero's round the corner for a coffee, and read some of the course material, the paper, napkins or just try to shag the easiest looking bird.  
  
  One dull October day, I finished my classes for the day, and had earlier made some plans to meet one of the few other 'lads' on my course - being a male English student has it's pitfalls; you get to spend a hell of a lot of time surrounded by mostly women, most of the blokes are really twatty, but there happened to be a couple of blokes I actually got on with. I believe this time it was Dave, who liked to be called Big Dave on account of him being quite tall, and being called Dave.  
  
  So, on with it. I had finished a bit early (Shakespeare 1, I think?) and decided to get started early. I didn't have much money as I'd been refused funding (no, I still don't know why) and so the venue was a Wetherspoons/Lloydds bar reasonably near the campus, which during the day was always quite quiet. The Montague Pike in Soho is a funny pub, having been converted from a theatre into a megabooze factory with a main entrance on Charring Cross Road, and a much smaller entrance just off of the corner of Soho square. Londoners will probably know those places well, others who are interested can [have a look at this google maps link.] (https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Soho+Square,+Soho,+London+W1D/@51.5153077,-0.1321499,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48761b2cd5d6a091:0x9be1edf045243ac0) Having been at the Westminster campus, I was coming from the Soho Square side of things, and went through the smaller entrance, which has a bar just inside and a couple of tables before the pub opens out into a very large area. Sort of like a door, followed by a wide corridor with a bar squeezed into it at which point you can follow the corridor down towards the main part of the bar which is much larger and airier and brighter. This is [the corridor bar] (http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/67/bc/a1/the-montagu-pyke.jpg) as seen from the street.  
  
  I ordered my pint, waited for it to settle and took a walk. Now, I suspect you've all been into lunchtime pubs before, so you expect *noise* of some kind. Conversation, the clinking of pint glasses, laughter from Sue in accounting trying to appear less boring to Trevor in HR who's married anyway, and as we're in London, tourists asking for Guinness because it's 'weird'. Right? Not today.   
  
  It took me a moment until I realised something was very *up* indeed. No noise. So, I walked toward  the main bar, which ballooned out in front of and from the corridor looks like [this.] (https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4043/4646598557_546b8c7baf.jpg) With every step, I started picking up more and more odd little sounds. A grunt here, a moan there and the sound of something like smacking. *Peculiar* I think to myself, and advanced. Eventually, I find myself at the top of the stairs that lead into the booze arena, and find myself in the strangest situation. It's an event of some kind, for people who cannot hear; a signing party. But... they were all... *small*, very very *small people*.  
  
 It took a few moments longer to realise what was happening here; it's a meet and greet session for deaf midgets. I was the lone tall person, in a sea of very small deaf people, all trying to find their soulmates.

Further to this point.

* The SNP refused to raise tax, which has been in the power of the Scottish Government since 1998 under the terms of the Scotland Act, in order to cover the budget black hole.  A 1% increase in the SVR across all income tax bands in Scotland would raise £400 million in extra tax revenues in Scotland, according to a Treasury analysis from 2010.  This would almost certainly have wiped out the majority of this health service budget shortfall.
* The SNP has adopted the position that governing is nothing more than doling out money handed to you from elsewhere and basking in the glory of delivering politically popular programmes like free bus passes.  Setting tax rates and other unpopular aspects of real governance, and taking responsibility for those decisions, is a task for Westminster to shoulder.
* From the moment the SNP have taken power their singular focus has been on the independence referendum, to the detriment of actual governance in Scotland.

They are not a good side, but we were very fortunate to win. Lots of improvement needed, and some players just need to be fucked off.
 
Mignolet (4). Dithering, mute twat. I've been on his case for ages, probably since Boxing Day against City when he threw away three points, but he's not getting any better. 

Slakho (3). He looks big and hard. He isn't. Spreads fear throughout the defence like the fucking Ebola virus. I'm also quite tired of hearing about his accurate passing and that his ratio of at least one horrific blunder per game is somehow ""magnified"" by his clumsy looking style of play. Let's be clear; making the types of mistakes he does - in every game - means that he's a terrible defender. Shit. Last night he was positionally suspect, and his customary mistake almost cost us a goal.
 
Lovren (4). I've said before that his gung-ho, shouty larger than life style of play does make him quite fun to watch. But I'd be much happier with a quiet defender who was better at defending, because Lovren isn't very good at it on the evidence so far. Almost gave away a penalty and was anything but solid. Makes you pine for the skill and quality of players like Carra and Hyypia
 
Moreno (7). Happily, while the goalkeeper and central defensive clowns are costing us goals, the story is much more promising on the flanks. Moreno was sharp, fast, great in attack and also made the tackle of the game to stop another goal. Best LB we've had since Riise was in his pomp.
 
Manquillo (7). Perhaps not as eye-catching as Moreno, this lad can play. Won the penalty and also solid in defence.
 
Gerrard (6). For all his talk about enjoying his new role, I don't think he does really. Seems almost desperate to be more involved, which can lead to some odd passes and almost curtailed movement, like he wants to burst forawrd, then remembers he can't. Nerveless penno, as usual and overall played well.
 
Henderson (6). Sometimes running around a lot isn't enough, and he needs to be more penetrative. Used the ball well on occasion, and could have imposed himself more, but still did OK overall.
 
Coutinho (3). Shouldn't be anywhere near the team in this form. Wasteful, meandering and ineffective.
 
Lallana (4). He's never going to be a £25m player, but he's much better than this, because last night he looked like a Sunday League player. Peripheral.
 
Sterling (6) Awful first half but buzzed around to much greater effect in the second half, despite lazily losing the ball when they scored. Wwe look a better side with him in it, obviously.
 
Balotelli (6). A huge improvement from the Villa game, in that he actually ran occasionally. Needs to do much more to justify his place, but nice finish for he goal.
 
Subs: 

Lucas (4) I don't know what the fuck Rodgers was thinking playing him so advanced, because Lucas struggles badly enough to play his usual holding role.

You'd have to ask an Economist

&gt; Don't forget that they are also promising tax cuts for business

If I'm not mistaken, that's an SNP policy.. a vote for independence is NOT a vote for the SNP.  The SNP would most likely be gone in the event of a Yes vote.. 

&gt;there might be a migration of at least some people in the higher tax brackets

This may or may not be an issue, but on the other side of the coin an independent Scotland could attract high tax bracket immigrants if the situation looked promising, it'd depend on how the situation actually panned out.. what a yes vote does is allows Scotland to try.

&gt;Plus a currency union is almost certainly not going to happen, so there will need to be substantial currency reserves if the Scottish currency is going to be pegged to the pound.

A currency union while I agree with you will most likely not be a permanent fixture, but depending on how negotiations go there is always the possibility of a temporary union for a time which would give Scotland enough time to figure out whether to adopt the Euro/its own currency and start to roll out that plan.. I expect it'l probably involve a deal that could involve keeping Trident for a few more years.  

In terms of currency reserves however, since iScotland has vastly contributed to the strength of the pound for the past 300 years, and Scotland is now being denied its home currency, iScotland may negotiate for a cut in our share of national debt to help make up our reserves for a stable central bank.  That, along with other asset splits could see Scotland doing just fine. 

Oil is 15% of our economy at the present, however the revenues are split up throughout the entire UK.  If Scotland splits, it owns 90% of the known geographical oil reserves, PLUS the possibility of more untapped reserves on the west coast which have been largely unexplored because of the Trident missiles being based there.  Not only that, but people seem to forget that as something runs out, it's value increases. Some economists predict that not even half of the total monetary worth has been extracted from the north sea oil because of this factor.  Half may be optimistic, but this factor certainly wont be inconsequential come 40 years time.

I can only see budgetary independence coming from the new currency route and would come after a prolonged period of free market 'guidance' to build up reserves and credibility - like Thatcher on steroids. After a while attitudes would change and Scotland could be in Hong Kong territory.

Personally I'd chose this route.

Other option is maybe eventually joining Euro by around 2020-30. It's by no means an easy route and there are layers of objection ahead. Quick assimilation is the most delightful of dreamy, rosy best case scenarios.

So you have no idea what you might be voting for.

&gt;  ...but on the other side of the coin an independent Scotland could attract high tax bracket immigrants if the situation looked promising, it'd depend on how the situation actually panned out.. what a yes vote does is allows Scotland to try.

What would Scotland have to offer them? Tax cuts?

&gt; In terms of currency reserves however, since iScotland has vastly contributed to the strength of the pound for the past 300 years, and Scotland is now being denied its home currency, iScotland may negotiate for a cut in our share of national debt to help make up our reserves for a stable central bank. That, along with other asset splits could see Scotland doing just fine.

Yeah but a proportion of the BoE reserves based on population is still less than a proportion of the national debt based on population. Plus it would cost more to service that debt (at least initially) than it would by remaining in the UK due to the lower credit rating. 

&gt; Not only that, but people seem to forget that as something runs out, it's value increases.  Some economists predict that not even half of the total monetary worth has been extracted from the north sea oil because of this factor. Half may be optimistic, but this factor certainly wont be inconsequential come 40 years time.

That only works if North Sea oil runs out at a slower pace than the rest of the world. Plus there are plenty of conflicting predictions about the future of North Sea oil. If the more pessimistic predictions turn out to be true then it will have a much bigger impact on a small country with a large proportion of its economy depending on it.",0,1410952453,null,0,false,0,ckkqdhl,t3_2gn4ut,t1_ckkqdhl,t1_ckkq8i6,null,1426962776,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The real reason why an independent Scotland will struggle, isn't because of these kind of reasons - it's because rUK will fuck it over.  

Not out of meanness, or bitterness at Scotland leaving - Scotland is free to decide to do whatever it wants and we all recognize that - but because after Scotland is independent, rUK would have no more responsibility or duty to act in Scotland's interest.

And from the day of independence, the rUK government will always put the rUK interest before Scotland's.   And it will do so with the full support of the people in England, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland.  And if this hurts Scotland, and it often will, tough luck.

I can't be bothered to rewrite all the reasons why, so I'll copy and paste a post on a similar topic that I've made previously below:



[We] I wouldn't hate Scotland, but if Scotland does leave the UK, our relationship changes.

If Scotland does go its own way, the rest of the UK and the Westminster Parliament, no longer would have any duty or responsibility for looking after Scotland's economic or other interests.

So Scotland can't expect the rest of the UK to go out of our way to help Scotland. We shouldn't do things to help Scotland, if they cost us money. For example, we should lend Scotland money on easy terms, or to continue to support Scottish-based banks, for example.

Scotland's NHS may be safe in Scotland's hands, but I wouldn't expect the Scottish NHS to make use of specialist heart or cancer centres which are only available in England, without paying commercial rates.

I wouldn't expect Scotland to get BBC content (apart from BBC Scotland that is) without paying commercial rates for it. Oh yes, and iplayer should be blocked in Scotland too (just like it is in the USA), as Scotland should be paying BBC World to watch BBC programs.

And Scotland and the rest of the UK would now become economic competitors.

So, for example, if rUK can attract companies and businesses and investors to relocate from Scotland to the rest of the UK, we would do it - just as we currently try to attract companies and investors from other parts of the world to relocate to the UK.

Actually we can do that with people too. There is already something of a brain drain of Scotland's best and brightest to London and the Southeast now (because of financial incentives and other reasons), but we should start trying to actively encourage it, as its in our economic interest.

You Scots don't seem to like the banks threatening to relocate from Edinburgh? At the moment, they're threatening to, maybe with a degree of political posturing, and maybe with some real concerns. But if Scotland leaves the UK, we should actively try to encourage them to relocate from Edinburgh to the city of London. We'll give them tax breaks, cheap office space in the world's biggest financial centre, and they'll be close to the world's biggest transport hub in Heathrow. They'll have a home market of 60 million, instead of 5 million. And they will be financially be backed by one of the world's largest central banks, the Bank of England, rather than whatever much smaller reserves a new Scottish central bank might be able to cobble together. And that means more money and economic growth for the rUK.

And if we can attract tourists to come to London or Cornwall or North Wales or the Lake District, instead of Scotland, we should do that too.

And if we can buy oil &amp; natural gas cheaper from UAE or Oman than Scotland, we should do that too.

If these things costs jobs &amp; prosperity in the Scotland, well that will be sad, but we'll do it anyway, because we no longer have any responsibility to support jobs &amp; prosperity in Scotland. Our sole responsibility is to maximize jobs &amp; prosperity in the rest of the UK.

Like I said, I don't want these things done to spite Scotland - far from it - but simply because they would now be a separate country, and the rUK government's responsibility is to maximize the prosperity of the rUK, even if costs our competitors (including now Scotland).

In summary, I don't want to treat an independent Scotland badly or go out of our way to hurt an independent Scotland, but neither would I expect us to treat Scotland better than any other foreign country.

The responsibility of the rUK government will be to the people of rUK, not to people of foreign countries, even ones that we used to be associated with, be they Cyprus, Malta, or Scotland.

And P.S.

If Scotland repudiates its share of the debt, I'm not averse to the rUK government removing every current UK government asset (which the debt paid for) North of the border, before granting independence.

If two individuals bought a house together, and took out a joint mortgage, and one of them subsequently repudiated any further mortgage payments, he couldn't reasonably expect to keep using share of the house. The same applies to UK government assets in Scotland, whether they are Eurofighters, government computer systems, air traffic control systems, or whatever.",0,1410953067,null,0,false,0,ckkqigw,t3_2gn4ut,t1_ckkqigw,t3_2gn4ut,null,1426962712,42,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,42

&gt;**Wolfsburg 'sleepless' ahead of trip to Liverpool**

&gt;VfL Wolfsburg make their return to Europea League competition this Thursday, after a five-year absence. In the first Group H game, the Niedersachsen will face off against English Premier League side Everton. The game will kick off at Goodison Park at 9.05pm, and the ""Wolves""' anticipation for the battle against the ""Toffees"" is huge. ""It's a great event, this sort of thing is the reason we play football"", said youngster Maximilian Arnold in an interview with NDR Info. The 20-year-old midfielder continued to say that he's been ""unable to sleep since Saturday"". His teammate Ivicia Olic, who won the competition as a CSKA Moscow player in 2005, knows how difficult the forthcoming task is. ""You have to try to pick up points across the six games, including your away fixtures. Everton and VfL are the favourites in the group, but the others are also very strong"", explained the Croatian. Those ""others"" he refers to are the Russian champions FK Krasnodar and French side OSC Lille.

&gt;**Allofs dreams of title**

&gt;Despite the team's mediocre start in this season's Bundesliga, taking two points from the first three games, manager Klaus Allofs is looking optimistically towards the club's return to European competition. ""I think we're not just competitive, but along with Everton the favourites for the group"", said the 57-year-old, who didn't rule out winning the competition: ""First we have to get through the group stage, but then anything is possible"". The fixture will have a special element due to the presence of Romelu Lukaku in the Everton squad. Wolfsburg courted the 21-year-old Belgian international's services for several weeks during the summer. At times it seemd that the Niedersachsen had a good chance of signing him. Then the player's agent, Mino Railoa, firmly rejected the club. The player, previously loaned from Chelsea to Everton, decided he would remain in Liverpool. For that, the Toffees had  to pay the London side a transfer fee of over 30M euros, a price Allofs and VfL would not have been prepared to pay.

&gt;**Benaglio and Schaefer in Europe in 2009**

&gt;On the subject of money... There was a substantial cost to the Wolves when they exited the competition in their last European appearance. On February 26, 2009, the North Germans lost 3-1 before a home crowd in their second round, second leg game against Paris St. Germain. Having also lost 2-0 in Paris, they bowed out of the competition. At that time, the team included two players, Diego Benaglio and Marcel Schaefer, who are also in the squad travelling for Thursday's game against Everton. Goalkeeper Benaglio will protect the VfL goal, while left-back Schaefer is likely to start from the bench.

Scotland doesn't need to actually *do* anything to join the EU it allready fully complies with each and every EU demand. The only thing it needs to have a *bureaucratic* agreement among the other countries to let it join.  

That can and will be easily done within the 2 years that they propose to set up their last institutions. As you say there are ways for some countries to block that. Notably Spain. My nation, Belgium has been mentioned also but as a Belgian an a mayor in european political sciences and a keen follower of Belgian politics I can assure you no such thing will be done by our current or future governement.  In fact our current largest party that is both heading the Federal and the Flemish parliamant wants the same for [Flanders as Scotland](http://english.n-va.be/en/about/faq).

*Our final target is indeed an independent Flanders as a European Member State, but the progression to reach it is gradual and must occur in a democratic manner.*

To block Scotland integration into the EU would be folly and in fact undermine the EU more then the *agreed upon* seccession. This isn't a country that just declared independence, this was orchestrated together witht the UK. UK wouldn't be able to claim that it didn't allowed it to join the EU if it volantarily and democraticly agreed to the seccession.

Spain may prove more difficult that is correct, but Spain itself can't and won't stop Scotland to join. There would be no arguments against it. And that is the crux of the argument. If you wanted to block Scotland to join you'd have to present a case against it. There are no viable cases to be made becaus its allready *in* it. In such negotiations you can't just go *I don't wanne* you have to build a logical, straigtforward and legal case against it, and certainly in Scotlands case that isn't possible since this referendum is actually organised within the UK.

Ill be voting for the Greens in the next election, assuming **Scotland** gains its independence.

&gt;What would Scotland have to offer them? Tax cuts?

There's a difference between wealthy people and greedy, wealthy people.  If all they want is tax cuts, they can live in London for all I care :)  Scotland has a lot more to offer than tax cuts for the rich.  Not to mention some gorgeous real estate with some beautiful scenery to boot.

&gt;Yeah but a proportion of the BoE reserves based on population is still less than a proportion of the national debt based on population.  

I never said it would magically fix the problem, though it would certainly help.

&gt;If the more pessimistic predictions turn out to be true then it will have a much bigger impact on a small country with a large proportion of its economy depending on it.

You better phone up Norway and tell them that..  arguing about oil is by and large useless since nobody knows exactly how much there is or how much worth can be extracted.  What we DO know however is that for the foreseeable future, Scotland has a very useful commodity in oil, and by the time the oil starts to diminish, Scotland will have built up its other multi billion pound industries, and clean energy proposals, and hopefully will have made a move to re-industrialise the country like it was pre-Thatcher.

First, yes the national wallet. Since 2009-10 Scotland has given the UK 211Bn and received 255Bn in return. For Scotland to match that under Independence it would have increased national debt by 30% of GDP. The UK's national debt has gone up by 12% of GDP in the same period. Scotland can't even afford what it currently has never mind what the SNP want. 

Scotland will start with a debt of 130Bn according to the Scottish Government, and on a GDP of 144Bn that's 90% of GDP in debt. If Scotland continues to spend what it spends, then by 2021 (5 years after Independence) the national debt will be 120%, putting us in the top 10 most in debt countries globally. Ten years after Independence at 150% we'll be #4 in the world, and 11% short of Greece at #3.

This is assuming Scotland's revenues and expenses stay the same post Independence, while almost every economic opinion suggests costs will go up or revenue will go down.

Here's an excerpt from another post that has links showing how they have come up with that figure and why it's made to look as bad as possible on the side of a yes vote. Also note that a yes vote is not a vote for SNP. If you have issue with any of the details feel free to highlight them and let us know why you think they are wrong:



Not wanting to get into a big argument here but, a lot of these figures cannot be seen as so cut and dried. Have a read of this scrutiny of the draft budget for 2014-2015 by BMA Scotland to get a feel for the complexity of the issue. For example:

""it is worth noting that the healthcare system is subject to long-term cost pressures of around 4 percent a year in real terms, resulting from technological and demographic change...""

These leaked £450 million of cuts to occur across two years, don't sound so unexpected when considered in these terms. Also from the above document:

""The increasing use of revenue budgets for capital expenditure is an issue of concern. While the capital budget is only a very small element of overall health DEL, the significant reduction in capital DEL means that while the Barnett consequential has been passed on for the health resource DEL, overall health spending in Scotland will fall by a greater amount than the total reduction in funding to Scotland from the Westminster Government...""

To try and unpack the above, the best I can understand it, is that via Barnett, we get allocated resource (staff, services etc.) and capital (buildings, equipment) spend/revenue SEPARATELY, both depending on what Westminster does. In recent years, the capital spend allocation from Westminster has dropped significantly through Barnett (perhaps as they fund capital expenditure increasingly through PFI and private investment). The Scottish government has therefore tried to prop up capital spend (to maintain our hospitals and equipment), by using money from the overall health budget. 

So this ends up in the weird position where both the SNP can claim they are using every penny available to them from the Barnett consequentials to fund the health service (as they are trying to keep hospitals open and fit for purpose), but as this leads to an overall reduction in spend on NHS resources (the stuff that is DISTINCT from spend on capital), the IFS and No campaign can legitimately claim that ""spending"" on NHS Scotland has gone down. 

Again, this difference could perhaps be attributable to the difference in how NHS Scotland and UK manage capital spending and how they invest in property

However, it is notable that the IFS report does not seem to break things down like this, focusing only on departmental spend, NOT capital spend. In fact, it does not mention the capital spend once. What it interestingly does mention are some familiar figures:

""A devolved Scottish Government could use the powers it will acquire under the Scotland Act to increase taxes to give it more money to spend. If it were to increase the Scottish rate of income tax by 1%, for instance, it would raise around *£400 - £450 million a year. This would be enough to boost health spending **by around 4%.""*

Hmm, now where have I seen those two figures before...

Ah yes, that would be exactly the gap the papers are currently discussing, which works out to a 4% figure due to...

""long-term cost pressures of around 4 percent a year in real terms, resulting from technological and demographic change..."" mentioned right at the top of this comment.

On actually digging up and reading these reports, it looks to me like these recent news stories, which lets not forget, are discussing current NHS/Scottish Government plans in the event of a ""No"" vote and relying on the Barnett formula, NOT plans for an independent Scotland, are discussing a gap which would exist regardless of budgetary constraints due to technological and demographic change, and in collaboration with a perhaps less than adequate interpretation of the situation from the IFS (by ignoring capital expenditure), the clear attempt is being made to make it look like the SNP are screwing over the Scottish NHS compared to NHS down south.

Having taken the time to look into things (and I accept I am not an expert and would welcome being corrected as I would rather be sure of what this all means than ""right""), it does look an awful lot to me that the SNP has done the best it can, given it has decided not to use PFI to fund capital expenditure. 

Also, it is ludicrous to claim that just because a public body is trying to make efficiency savings based on acknowledged challenges, these should be equated with ""cuts"", for example:

""...it is right that, despite protected budgets, the NHS is as efficient as possible with taxpayer’s money ... health boards are making efficiency savings of three per cent, with all savings being reinvested in front line care.”

If anything this whole argument solidifies for me the fact that it would be a lot easier if we didn't have to play within the boundaries of Barnett and react to how down south chooses to spend it's money or build it's hospitals, and just took care of it ourselves.

I also acknowledge that without seeing the actual document that has been ""leaked"" it is hard to contextualise all this correctly, but I still maintain, things are not as straightforward as today's headlines are making it appear and would encourage people to investigate further.

It's a massive kick up the arse for the whole of the UK, and Westminster in particular.

Has anyone ever made a racist/inappropriate joke back at Prince Phillip? How did it go?

I imagine that people just try to laugh awkwardly through it, no matter how offended they may be inside. It's all well and good to say that people should have a sense of humour and understand that perhaps he doesn't mean any real malice with it, but it reminds me of those youtube assholes who go around insulting people and call it a ""prank"". I wonder how he would respond to a joke at his expense.

For example:

&gt;""Still throwing spears?""

""Still being ignorant?""

&gt;""If it has got four legs and it is not a chair, if it has got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.""

""And the British would subjugate it with force.""

&gt;""In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.""

Pretty much any savings account. Go with a bank that has a branch you can walk to, or open a savings account with your current bank. You want something that has easy access (like this: http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/savings-accounts/flexible-saver ) and probably that you can open online.

Here's another that'd be fine: http://www.postoffice.co.uk/savings-accounts/online-saver?intcampaignid=MnfinanceOS that's online only, but shouldn't really be a problem if you're happy handling things online.

You can wander into a bank and talk to someone, too.

It doesn't matter whether he *intended* malice or not, describing East Asians as ""slitty eyed"" was already a common derogatory phrase used extensively in the West so he should have known it would cause offence even if said as a joke.

I'm not saying he should be censored or punished in any way for saying it, since I think it is everyone's right to be as offensive as they like, celebrities included.

But he is still the Prince and as such, his words naturally carry weight and face scrutiny, and people shouldn't be surprised that many people would be offended by his words, or blame them for being offended so.

Put it another way, if I were to walk up to a gang of black teenagers in a rough neighbourhood, and make a racially charged black joke, I would expect to get the shit kicked out of me, regardless of it being ""only a joke"" and regardless of whether I am actually prejudiced against black people or not.

Still, it is, and should be perfectly legal for me to do such a stupid thing, so long as I am happy to face the consequences of people being offended, whether the consequences be in the form of an ass kicking, or verbal retaliation. I wouldn't and shouldn't give me special dispensation to be offensive just because I am old or I am royalty.

councils are basically screwed - they can raise business rates and have dead town centres, or they can massively slash services, which is what they are having to do in examples like this.

Absolutely. Intelligence comes in a steady shortwave stream. But only in extreme emergency would there be communication from the chain of command. In effect a firing order.

The US Tridents require launch codes from the chain of command in order to render the missiles fireable. The UK Tridents are launchable unilaterally without requirement of command authorisation. This is so that the missiles can be launched even if Northwood and Whitehall are wiped out.

&gt; Are you seriously suggesting that if the PM order a submarine to position itself off the coast of the falklands to strike argentina under a NATO led first strike on a potential aggressor, the protocol is to refuse?

The PM would never give that order. The sub doesn't move ""into position"". It fires straightaway. The extra minutes of flight is offset by the day or two under the sea, by which time argentine intelligence will have already heard of the order.

NATO will only strike at nuclear-armed nations. So not Argentina. Furthermore, the UK will only use nuclear weapons if invaded or as a second strike.

&gt; doesn't mean all uk vanguard submarines operate in the dark with no communication.

The subs generate no outgoing signals of any kind unless there is imminent inevitable capture, incapacitation or destruction of the vessel.

Its true that prices for the mainland UK maybe cheaper as the uk no longer subsidises the increase cost of doing business in scotland due to its sparser population and infrastructure, so in some field yes, but overall the other factors are probably more significant, i.e a pint of milk might cost 4% less but your mortgage will be 4% more, and i bet you spend more on your mortgage than you do on your Groceries. Likewise the cost of doing business in the uk increases because everyones basics costs increase a little too as its linked to the money markets and international perceptions of states and risk etc.

We are better together, but the Uk is only slightly worse apart, and scotland is royally fucked apart.

While it isn't illegal and shouldn't be illegal to use such terms, whether maliciously or not, we do have to accept that in our society, certain words and phrases have a history and can easily cause offence in certain contexts.

I think we need to see a little more technical quality and understanding in our play before we start breaking down deep defences and teams who come to sit back and hit us on the counter, which is why I think Rodgers has continued with trying one striker up top - we need to be able to pick teams apart when they're hard to break down.

United is a tricky one. They've recently played a variant of the 4-4-2 diamond that worked so well for us most of last season, but it's hardly a unique style. They definitely seem like their defense is shaky, if they were caught a man short or isolated on the counter they could leak goals, but they have too much quality up top to give them too much of the ball. I think we would look to strike a balance.",0,1410956938,null,0,false,0,ckkriv7,t3_2glixe,t1_ckkriv7,t1_ckkphn5,null,1426962240,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

That somewhat depends on the type, but sure why not.

A flat tax is not a progressive tax. A progressive tax is when the rate increases as you earn more.

First off there are different types of travelers. There are the Irish travelers who are the ones with a reputation that rightly proceeds them and there are Romani travelers.

Lock the garage and keep an eye on my kids. Well it turns out my fears were ungrounded. Romani are actually devout Catholics on the whole never steal or threaten violence and they hate having a bad name from being associated with Irish travelers.

Our lot stayed for a few weeks and then moved on. Turns out they were down for the horse festivals. When they went they bagged up all the rubbish into a neat pile and left with only a few track marks on the grass.

Dier has done very well in the RB slot but he is far away from the pace that either of those two have and I am ready for him to get time in his actual position.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"&gt; That's why most people are less fussed about Abramovich than Matthew is. And its not because football ""is subject to a different set of rules"". In fact, its quite the opposite. Its because football is no different in that sense than the rest of society.

That's pretty much what the argument is, isn't it.

Unfortunately I don't think it really matters to a lot of people in the /r/soccer or ""I don't like Chelsea camp"". Gab's argument plays into the already formed opinions of people who will always point to Roman's wealth as a blemish on Chelsea's reputation. To them comparing other equally or more dubious owners to Roman is deflection from our issue. Comparing badly behaving multinationals is deflection. It's all deflection unless we're not supporting the club anymore.

Capitalism and business on Reddit is black and white, there are no grey areas. You either do your business and make a fortune in the daylight and have all your records in PDF format online, or you're a shady oligarch who broke the backs of millions to make a fortune. It's weird - the cult of personality around guys like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Elon Musk on this website. They're great because they want to raise taxes on the rich, are philanthropic, and make these great contributions to science.

Consider that in relation to Gab's statement:

&gt;What would happen if we tried to forensically track down the source of everyone's wealth? We - as in Western Europeans - would probably not enjoy our findings

He's not wrong you know. Several *trillion* in offshore wealth, taxes not being paid by billionaires who park assets in Geneva, Delaware, and British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. Crack open the bank accounts of guys like Ellis Short (chair, Sunderland AFC), the Glazer's, or Usmanov. Chips Keswick the Chairman of Arsenal one of the directors of Jardine Matheson, a Hong Kong based conglomerate incorporated in *another* tax haven, Bermuda. I'm sure they're all paying taxes in their respective jurisdictions and there isn't any sort of financial wrongdoing, right? They're all good, no accounting tricks that would upset Reddit.

That's just in the Premier League! Consider guys like Rybolovlev, once Russian citizen now Monegasque with a net worth of over $9bn. I'm sure he earned his nut legitimately, and is assisting Russians who helped him earn it by paying taxes.

I said this exact shit the last time this came up, because it seems like we get a Syed thread every couple of months and every Redditor thinks his articles are incredibly deep. They aren't, all you need is a cursory understanding of the Yeltsin administration to know that everything state owned went up for sale when the Soviet Union fell - his associates got in on the ground floor on lucrative business. The only difference between Roman and some other Oligarchs is he went into football in the biggest league in the world. Others retired with their cash or went to prison.

But Syed shuts the door after focusing on Roman and makes a fool out of anyone who points to other suspicious football ownership. Qatar and the UAE effectively skirting state owned football team rules by utilizing shell private equity vehicles (""City Football Group"", ""Qatar Sports Investment""), or Glazer taking over united with its own money putting the club £525m in debt.

Which just about abramovich covers everything objectively complaint worthy (thanks to the guy in /r/soccer who was posting it to ignorant fools). Although I'm not sure if dredging up MD posts would be welcomed here.

Syed doesn't seem to understand how everyone has done something dodgy to get to the top. (Or perhaps he does and he's feigning ignorance to suit his purposes, one supposes that he can't really be that stupid.) That's how you get there. Picking on abramovich is particularly harsh and easy. Lacking in any real investigative work as there wasn't really legislation to follow in Russia at the time. I'd rather appreciate if he ""investigated"" the much more covert dealings of football.

But then I don't know what to expect of football journalists. The football as escapism argument irritates me. It ought to be controlled like any other business sector and so on, it's not a fantasy world even if most of the journalism that surrounds it is more akin to fawning children in a shop window than actual intelligent assessment. But I don't suppose many people will really read what the economist has to say on football finances, owners or football federation organisations as opposed to reading something where someone else accuses someone of being morally objectionable.

Not gonna happen.

**If** there is a yes vote, then it seems incredibly likely that the existing legislative precedent for a country seceding from the UK will be applied. After all, Ireland left less than a century ago: the laws are still on the books, the mechanism worked, so why reinvent the wheel (when you've got limited time in which to do so)?

If you look at the way Ireland separated ... people living there acquired a new nationality (Irish) but were entitled to retain British citizenship: the UK recognizes dual (and multiple) nationality. There was also a free travel agreement and reciprocal right of residence. Today, as a British Citizen, I am legally able to visit Ireland, find somewhere to live, and register to vote in their elections *immediately*. (After a few years' residence I can then swear an oath and take Irish citizenship if I am so inclined.) A little-known fact among Little Englanders is that this arrangement works in the other direction, too: Irish citizens could freely move to the UK (and vote in our elections) before both nations joined the EU.

So. Unless everybody in Westminster and Holyrood take leave of their collective senses, all that will happen is that people living in Scotland acquire the right to a second passport: and if you're English and want to emigrate to Scotland, you could go there and have full rights of residence except for having to wait a couple of years before qualifying for the passport.

true,Wargame4life,null,null,"Yeah absolutely, the greater the frequency of usage of an asset like a road the better the value for those who pay for it.

Obviously wear and tear increases with increased usage but overall total cost is less as the utility value of the asset is increased with more usage i.e ""getting your moneys worth""

So yes the road network in the UK will be ""more efficient"" and better value without scotland as it loses the higher cost low traffic network of scotland.

But it would still be overall probably more expensive than together because the money to pay for it is still linked to international markets.

I.e to illustrate, if you borrow £100 at 50% APR to buy goods that are worth  £120 compared to borrowing £100 at 25% apr to buy goods that are worth £110 the increased cost of borrowing can completely undermine  the savings of a better value purchase.

I.e what looks like a £10 saving on paper might actually be an increased cost When you factor in all the actual forces and factors around the spending.

With this in mind Scotland is really shooting itself in the foot as the UK can collectively use its buying power to negotiate a better rate than scotland ever can, simply by virtue of its order of magnitude larger population.

Either way you look at it scotland faces much greater challenges than the uk does or will.

***

Back in the very first days of Rassilon’s discovery of Time Travel, after he had made his initial voyages, The Other also travels and returns.

Upon his return, he meets with Rassilon. He tells him that on his travels he encountered a society who had perfected the science of Psychohistory. He had given them enough information, and they had predicted all possible fates for the Timelords. In each one, they had predicted that another race would be certain to arise and defeat them. There was no possible solution to this that could arise from within Timelord society itself.

The Other proposes to Rassilon that a new project is undertaken, a project that will pave the way to producing a class of Timelords that will travel away from Gallifrey, that will separate themselves from it, live externally and acquire enough knowledge and values from elsewhere to provide a solution to the eventual challengers. And yet would retain enough loyalty to return and help when the time came. This would be the Renegade program, culminating in the Deca: the Doctor, The Master, The Monk, The Rani... the ultimate Renegades.

Rassilon agrees and begins to scour the universe looking for likely races that would be their challengers – setting them one against the other in a series of challenges, disguised as public entertainment: the Death Zone. Those that he identifies as the most likely, he removes from the public zone for further, intensive study, ready for eventual intervention – for which he established the Celestial Intervention Agency.

***generations later...***

After an undistinguished time at the Academy, and with out even thinking of leaving Gallifrey, the Doctor is working in the bureau of Possible Events where he notices that several contradictory events on Gallifrey are becoming both possible and indeed more probable. He reports this to superiors, who at first take it seriously, but then reassign him and do nothing. His attempts to query this are rebuffed and he continues his research on his own time. Once he has more facts, he follows the superior to confront him. Before he can, however, the doctor finds another version of himself doing exactly the same thing.  

They are eventually taken to a third version who is in a senior political position, and establish that fissures in time have been opened inside Gallifrey’s own timeline, reaching back to Rassilon’s time. The device that he has built to monitor them, accidentally enabled him to cross between them too.  

The first alternate time line was caused by an extremist faction, but other factions have noticed and have followed suit, resulting in numerous parallel timelines, threading back through history, but so well hidden that most of the population remain unaware. Until one comes to dominate, it is in the interests of each of the factions to keep it that way.  

The Doctors develop a plan for two of them to return to the extreme past and seal the fissures. When getting there, they put a lock on time, preventing anyone from travelling further back. The process of so doing means that one version is trapped at that time (becoming marooned as the Other, leading to the events in the first section, and also interfering to bring about the Pythia’s curse, etc) whilst the second returns, starting the process of knitting the time lines back together – which will filter slowly forward through time. Once back, and manipulating the final process, he is approached by faction representatives to influence the final version of the timeline.  

With the collapse of the hidden factionalism underway, more direct and even violent struggles are now taking place. At least one faction has plans to use the Hand of Omega to retain their version of the timeline, and the Doctor finds that it is yet another version of himself at the head of that faction. Realising that he fundamentally hates the internal politics, and the inevitability that it will continue, with or without time fissures, he resolves to leave. He has made contact with his other selves by temporally multiplexing the matrix, and mentally influences (or is influenced by) all of his other selves to do the same, at the same time. Each rationalises their urge to leave – as boredom if nothing else – and does so.  

It is just as he is leaving through the Transduction barrier that the Timelines finally merge, leaving him and Susan (who some versions know to be his grandchild and yet others find as an unknown refugee from the fighting, hiding in the TARDIS) with multiple, simultaneously true, memories of events.  

These memories are fragmented as they fuse into one, but that is as nothing compared to the damage done to them when the Fetchers eventually trace the TARDIS and activate the its defences, in an attempt the get them to return. But that is another piece of head-cannon altogether…  

***

Since the various factions will have altered Gallifrey’s policies on openness, it would allow for Clara to be present in the TARDIS bays, whilst Sarah Jane couldn’t go to Gallifrey at all, allows Susan and the Doctor to be escaping together under fire, and him leaving alone through boredom, would allow for the Hand of Omega to be present in some versions etc., since the fixed point in time would be at the end of the fissure, at the moment that he actually leaves, and when everything fuses down to one.  

The big problem with this is the question of identity prior to that point of fusion. I could say that character that we know as the Doctor only comes into being as a result of that point of fusion, and that each character prior to that point is only an “aspect” of the Doctor, but that just side-steps the issue of him “contacting his alternate selves via the Matrix” – if some of those selves are half human, and others not, presumably he had altogether different ancestors and so different genes (as well as different social circumstances in his upbringing – not to mention being loomed in some cases and not in others.  

We have seen quite a number of hints that Timelord consciousnesses are not nearly as bound up with individual bodies, genetics, or even species as others, but they are the sum of their memories – and the Doctor (or equivalent) would have had different memories in each timeline, so surely would be a different person – unless we imagine that the true essence of a timelord to be an independent, pre-formed, cross-timeline consiousness waiting to be embodied.  

Now, given that we have encountered a few foes – the Great Old Ones – who are described as being the equivalent of the Timelords from a previous universe, who ARE essentially that, it still may be a possibility.

The diamond is the best formation for this side even if it doesn't allow us to put our ""best XI"" on the field. We all wish the 4-3-3 would work like it did last season but it just isn't *right now*. Our best performance by far this season, the spurs game, was an example of how the diamond fits our style.

Having 2 men in midfield makes me feel physically ill. We use split center backs so often in our offensive shape that if one of the CMs makes a run or goes to press he leaves a gigantic motherfucker of a space between him and the center back. Just keeping the one holding midfielder to drop back in between the split center backs IMO provides a bit more security.

Coutinho is having a rough patch of form but we can't risk making the same mistake Inter did by throwing the baby out with the bath water. We've all seen that he can dominate games but he can also be targeted and marked out of the game (see: Ozil, Mesut). The one thing Coutinho can do that Ozil can't is play CM in a midfield three and play extremely well. I would like to see him there more in a sort of Iniesta role rather than a straight up number 10.

Mignolet is probably the most controversial player in the squad right now. That Ludogorets goal where he came out for no reason made me face palm so hard I bruised my own forehead.

Left leaning Yes voters *should* have worked harder to condemn the unpleasantness and intimidatory tactics employed by many on their side. 

I have friends in Glasgow who have spoken about the intimidation they've felt from Yes voters in their workplace, in the pub and other social situations. No voters have frequently been scared into silence and that's a damned shame.

I'm going to quote the article at length because it speaks for itself:

&gt; There’s the Not All Argument. You’ll have heard it.

&gt; It’s not all men. Not all coppers. Not all journalists at the News of the World.

&gt; And then there’s the Small Minority Excuse. You’ve probably dismissed it before.

&gt; Every time a new UKIP councillor is exposed as a bigot, Nigel Farage will remind us that they come from a small minority within the party.

&gt; It’s not all Yes campaigners who would scratch the word “coward” into the front door of a No voter. It’s not all Yes campaigners who would scrawl “traitor watch” onto a No Thanks placard. Not all would burn a No sign in the street. Not all would call a group of Scots “slaves” and “Uncle Toms”, or say that another was “ashamed to be Scottish” for having the temerity to support a No vote. Not all would turn up at street events of their opponents, up and down the country, to hurl so much vile abuse that police advise further events be cancelled. Not all would seek to intimidate journalists. Not all would shove old women and mothers with prams.

&gt; These aren’t isolated incidents; they are happening every day. It is now far, far past the point where this can be played off as an insignificant proportion. They are orchestrated attempts to shout down and put fear into their opponents. It is now clear that there is something inherent in pro-independence campaign that encourages these individuals and these actions – and those who will revert to the Not All Argument or Small Minority Excuse are encouraging it by their failure to tackle it.

An independent Scotland doing well (or at least not doing badly) is much more beneficial to us in the rUK than Cyprus, Kuwait or Peru doing well.  It is far more integrated.  There are far more British companies doing work with Scottish companies and Scottish people.  There are more people in the North who work in Scotland than there are people in rUK who work in Italy.  It simply isn't within our interests for us to do some of the stuff you are talking about, it will fuck us over long term.

It's not a viable alternative at all. I've used Bitcoins before and they're a pain in the fucking arse. Registered to Kraken which was promoted as the best European exchange at the time. They asked me for all kinds of details and then on top of that they required SEPA transfer which would be £10. 

In the end I went to localbitcoins.com and just paid 20% over the exchange price for some from some guy. Then localbitcoins.com when down for 3 days by which point the price of bitcoin had fallen and I couldn't even buy the drugs I wanted to buy. 

The only reason I can see for putting yourself through this complete ball ache of a payment system is if you want to buy some illegal shit online. Because no one would open themselves up to all these shifty companies and exchange rate risk just to spend bitcoins on sites you can easily just use paypal/amazon payments/credit cards. 

Every time you tip someone 10 cents, you're basically saying 'Here's 10 cents. Now jump through hours of hoops for it.'

Maybe on /r/bitcoin it makes sense because everyone has a wallet and an exchange account already. But everywhere else it's just shilling.

I do actually agree with your point to a large extent, but this is what referendums are always like, and points like these are selectively and disingenuously applied by each side. For instance, that stupid advert made by the No campaign, targeted at women, was jumped all over by the Yes side, and most people did not seem particularly keen to say 'this is irrelevant'.

Although I would say, with politicians, there is value in it. Attacking Alex Salmond is exactly equivalent to attacking Cameron and Osborne (which again has been enthusiastically engaged in by many on the pro-Independence side), but 'we don't want to be run by Tories' is a valid part of the argument, and the same applies in reverse to an independent Scotland run by the SNP. It is extremely likely that Salmond would win the first election, and stay in power for more than one parliament, because of his feel-good role in independence, his skill as a politician, and the SNP's organization setup, which would outweigh the competition for a long while (a new opposition would have to be setup and develop). So scrutiny of Salmond and the SNP is valid to a degree, both in terms of Salmond's personal qualities, and also his track-record of political positions. For instance, one of the massive cock-ups of Westminster over the last decade was the consensus in favour of financial deregulation, and Salmond has played on their incompetence, so it is worth pointing out that he was also strongly in favour of it, and had he been in control Scotland may well have wandered even further off into lala land than the UK prior to 2008.",0,1410959379,null,0,1410962459,0,ckksbt6,t3_2glt79,t1_ckksbt6,t1_ckkr5c9,null,1426961866,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Completely agree with this.

Yedlin plays consistently great balls in and has composure/vision to pull play back when there is nothing there instead of giving away possession trying to pick a striker out in a sea of opponent shirts.

Mugged off - ""mugged off"" by an mls player hardly has anything to do with skill. In America, weights are relied on heavily. I don't know about how players develop regarding strength training in England, but it is a huge part of American sports and culture. Him being pushed off by someone two years older doesn't say that much to me. Yedlin is barely 20 and likely has some growth left in him. Yedlin showed his strength in the World Cup against both Germany and Belgium, both very sizable and strong teams.

3 years ago walker - not much to say here, I didn't watch villa that season. I know he played very well there, but if this sub is anything to believe, then Kyle was ""awful"" the next season he returned. 

Hyped on reddit - reddit is an American site. It's users are predominately American. Yedlin is arguably the biggest prospect for the usmnt. Are you surprised he's hyped here?

I wasn't saying that Yedlin will surpass walker, but honestly they are extremely similar football specimens. If you brought Kyle up in the USA or Yedlin up in England, they could easily have been each other.

true,iheke,null,null,"Firstly, I think that OP is wrong.

We do have a link between defence and attack and his name is Capoue

379 Attempted passes with 90% (349) completed are phenomenal numbers (He’s ranked first in the league in his position) Modric has 147 off 3 games with 89% completion but in truth both players do different things.

I think what OP is really getting at is who is going to be our assist maker?

Firstly, the bad news – top 3 assist makers in the premier league this year are Fabregas (6), Siggurdson (4) and Ramires (3).

The bad news being we had a number 10 in Siggi who we played out wide and then complained when he played poorly.  His start for Swansea, shows that AVB and Sherwood both hadn’t a clue how to use him.

The slightly better news is Lamela has 2 assists already so it’s not like he’s that far behind Ramires or Siggurdson.  But Fabregas is the top assist maker in the league by a country mile.

Now for the scary bit of news, the other bit of data most analysts will be looking at are the key passes.  At present the top 10 in the league is dominated by Chelsea: Hazard (1st), Fabregas (5th), Costa (8th) and Ivanovic (9th) – who have generated 42 KPs over their 4 games. This shows (a) they are on fire at the moment and (b) they have production coming from a lot of areas.  I know the focus is on Cesc and those 6 assists but when you at the end of that many key passes the assists will come.  

The worrying thing for Spurs is that Eriksen while well placed at 10 with 9 KPs the next Spurs player is 22nd with Adebayor (6).  At the moment, we have one assist maker (Lamela) and one key pass maker (Eriksen) and one goal scorer (Chadli). This is not good in the longer term and we’ll need all of these players to be pretty good at all three disciplines (i.e. assists, KPs and Goals).

Returning to OP’s original point, in today’s Spurs team Modric would be played as part of the front 3.  Is he better than Eriksen/Lamela/Chadli? He’s 30 yrs old, in his prime, he should be. Could one of the above be as good as Modric was at Spurs?  Jury is still out. Closest candidate is Lamela -- 6 KPs, 2 Asst – is not to bad for now, if he can add more goals and assists it is quite possible that he will be the next playmaker (key man) for the team.",0,1410961076,null,0,false,0,ckksz6j,t3_2glr3q,t1_ckksz6j,t3_2glr3q,null,1426961562,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Well the Scottish Parliament will get more powers; that much is certain. I would imagine that it'll be tax raising powers, such as control of income tax while in 2016 Scotland is *already* going to get power to vary Income tax by 10%, stamp duty and the landfill levy as part of the Scotland Act of 2012. So no, I don't think it's likely the Scottish Parliament won't get *even more* powers, especially considering all three main party leaders have pledged to make sure *it does*.

&gt; MP's being reassured they aren't government policy as well as several MP's coming out pretty much immediately after the 'vow' and saying they would never vote for such powers.

Oh please, I think there are more Pandas in Edinburgh zoo than MPs who have said they'd vote against *any* more powers.

&gt; We've certainly rattled the established but if there's a no vote watch it all fade away. At most we'll have the Barnett formula scrapped and the ability to limit the retail names of certain variety's of Scotch eggs or something.

They've already pledged (Wrongly, in my view) to keep the Barnett Formula. By the way, last time I checked, my any logical definition, the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament based in the Royal Palace of Holyrood, is part of *the establishment*.

But the main point is that an Independent Scotland will pretty much have to adopt the Euro. Two reasons:

The rest of the UK is not going to allow Scotland to sashay into the club of independent nations with a UK corporate credit card in hand. There will be NO currency union - the rUK voters will simply not allow it.

But ""Sterlingisation"" (ie using the pound without permission, like a banana republic might) is not an option, because no Scottish bank will get a banking license from the Bank of England. This means that these former banks will not be able to lend money on a fractional reserve basis. The Scottish economy would collapse. 

Meanwhile, Scotland has expressed its intention to re-join the EU. Despite the bluster, Brussels will welcome Scotland into the fold in double quick time, with one proviso: adopt the Euro. Most Scots won't be happy with this, but there will literally be no alternative. There is no chance that Scotland will create its own currency in the time frame allotted.

Registered to Kraken which was promoted as the best European exchange at the time. They asked me for all kinds of details and then on top of that they required SEPA transfer which would be £10. 

Like I said, you don't need to deal with exchanges so why do you keep mentioning them and all the hoops they make you jump through. You can buy bitcoins without any of that hassle and have them within minutes like I said.

&gt;In the end I went to localbitcoins.com and just paid 20% over the exchange price for some from some guy. Then localbitcoins.com when down for 3 days by which point the price of bitcoin had fallen and I couldn't even buy the drugs I wanted to buy. 

What, a site on the Internet went down? Stop the fucking press! 

Localbitcoins = 292 GBP/BTC.  
Coinfloor = 280 GBP/BTC.  

That's a difference of 4.29%, not 20%

&gt;The only reason I can see for putting yourself through this complete ball ache of a payment system is if you want to buy some illegal shit online. Because no one would open themselves up to all these shifty companies and exchange rate risk just to spend bitcoins on sites you can easily just use paypal/amazon payments/credit cards. 

Yep, just ignore the fact that you can purchase fast food from most places in the UK using bitcoin. Just ignore companies like Dell, Newegg, Scan and all the other legitimate companies who accept bitcoin.

&gt;Every time you tip someone 10 cents, you're basically saying 'Here's 10 cents. Now jump through hours of hoops for it.'

You can't tip people pennies (this is /r/UK you loon) at all, but you can tip them BTC though. And they don't have to jump through hoops to claim that BTC from the tipbot. They might have to jump through hoops if they want to convert that BTC to GBP on a exchange which requires jumping through hoops. That's a personal choice though and absolutely not necessary.

&gt;Maybe on /r/bitcoin it makes sense because everyone has a wallet and an exchange account already. But everywhere else it's just shilling. 

LOL. Just like it's shilling when I see an old person writing a letter and I tell them they can use email.

Like I said, you're an anti-bitcoin campaigner who ignores the facts and spreads bullshit because you hate bitcoin for some reason.

1. Historical Time- This is the typical time that the Doctor travels through. When he says an event happened in 1965, he's talking about Historical Time.  
2. Personal Time- This is your personal timeline. Most people's Personal Time is lies directly atop Historical Time, just only for a small segment of it. However, if you time travel, your Personal Time becomes uncoupled from Historical Time. An event can occur in the Historical past, but be in a time travelers Personal future.  
3. Narrative Time- This is how we the audience experience time while watching a show. This type of time explains why things that happen in later episodes don't effect previous episodes (most of the time). If an event occurs in the Narrative future but the Historical past, the effects of that event be seen in an episode that occurs in the Narrative past yet Historical present. So if there was an episode where 12 stops the JFK assassination, 11's episodes won't reflect that because it hasn't happened yet. This also explains why the Historical future can be different when traveling from different points in Narrative Time.  
  
This was all prerequisite for my theory on the Time War. It's an event that happened exclusively in Narrative Time. That's why it can have just have happened in both the Historical past and far future in the Ninth Doctor's episodes (I'm referring to The Unquiet Dead and The End of the World). The Time War rippled changes through Historical Time, so at when traveling to any Historical Time from Narrative 2005, it has always just ended, but if you traveled to that point from Narrative 2014, the Time War has been over for a while.  
  
This also accounts for negated timelines, like the Doctor dying on Trenzalore. Let's pretend his death is at Historical year X. From the Narrative Time frame of The Name of the Doctor, he does in fact die in Historical year X. However, due to events that occur in between the Narrative Time of that episode and The Time of the Doctor, he doesn't die at Historical year X. BUT, he still has experienced an event in his Personal Time where he dies in the Historical year X, but he also experiences that event in his Personal Time where he doesn't die, because of Narrative Time.  
  
Edit: so if you were able to travel along the Doctor's Personal timeline, you'd be be able to experience two separate versions of things that happen at Historical year X. They both happened, but him dying is now only accessible via travel through Personal, and MAYBE Narrative, time",0,1410963063,null,0,1410963845,0,ckkttlf,t3_2gnd8o,t1_ckkttlf,t3_2gnd8o,null,1426961168,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I can see he truly cares about the Doctor and the lore, and he has so much fun writing, and it's also clear there is either a need from him, from BBC or from somewhere that has dictated the stories need to keep unravelling, hence the arcs. I would put money on the BBC telling him to do that for moneymaking purposes, not that I'm cynical or anything.

What also gets me is I literally don't remember any talks like this about Russell T Davies, and I found his writing to be tremendously childish. I much prefer Moffatt's tenure over Davies.

However, the important thing here is: **Doctor Who is a show that continually evolves and it will never please *ever single fan* with every episode. It's okay not to like certain runs but don't insult people who like those, or go after the poor guy on Twitter. Being a fan means liking something and being apart of a community, and you can't be apart of a community if everything you spout is hatred.** It actually saddens me to see groups like what I mentioned, because that's the antithesis of being a fan. That's just being rude. 

I'll gladly listen to people who don't understand my appreciation for Moffatt's writing and I'll gladly talk about that as an adult if they do the same. I'm outta there if it's just a circle jerk about how Tom Baker was the best doctor and how Moffatt is a sexist, homophobic, racist, stupid, man-loving, man-hating, animal-killing, stupid writer, because people get emotional (god knows why) about shows, yes, that they like, but they've got no... like, it *literally* doesn't affect them, what's the point in getting emotional over how a story's played out? Seriously? It's great to put effort into enjoying a show and looking forward to the next episode and everything but don't go spouting nothing but hatred, because I don't count you as a fan if that happens.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;Like I said, you don't need to deal with exchanges so why do you keep mentioning them and all the hoops they make you jump through. You can buy bitcoins without any of that hassle and have them within minutes like I said.

Where/how? When I bought some 6 odd months ago localbitcoins and exchanges were the only options. 

&gt;That's a difference of 4.29%, not 20%

But I only wanted £50 worth. It's more expensive because less sellers want to deal with such low orders. It was at least 10-15% IIRC. 

Even if it is 4.29%, that's 4.29% I now need to pay on top of whatever product I'm buying purely because I want to use bitcoin. It doesn't sound like that good a deal. Especially when the amount of retailers that accept bitcoin is relatively tiny anyway. 

&gt;Yep, just ignore the fact that you can purchase fast food from most places in the UK using bitcoin. Just ignore companies like Dell, Newegg, Scan and all the other legitimate companies who accept bitcoin.

I'm not ignoring it. I'm telling you it's completely pointless. Unless I can do something with Bitcoin that I can't do with credit/debit cards or paypal then what's the sodding point? Why would I bother paying all those fees to use acquire bitcoin just to do.... Exactly the same transactions I was doing before. 

There's only two uses for Bitcoin at the moment that genuinely can't be done with the traditional banking system. Buying drugs, and gambling online if you live in the USA. Basically, illegal shit that banks don't want to touch. 

And it's always funny to me when you guys try to distance yourself from literally the only decent use of Bitcoin. The only reason it gained any actual popularity was Silk Road and Justdice. 

&gt;Like I said, you're an anti-bitcoin campaigner who ignores the facts and spreads bullshit because you hate bitcoin for some reason.

I'm a realist. Bitcoin is pretty damn good if you want to do illegal shit, but illegal shit is a niche use. Unless the Bitcoin community come up with a legal killer app it'll remain being used by drug dealers/users, gamblers and delusional bagholders.

true,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Yeah, ""date of last subordination"" is very tenuous as a criteria. It says ""last date of control by an external government"", but how is external defined?  When the province of Britannia was created, it was very much an internal region of the Roman Empire.  There wasn't a Britain to subjugate, just a bunch of tribal kingdoms without  a real national identity. Not to mention Rome never succeeded at completely conquering Scotland (Hadrian's and Antonine Wall were effectively the border controls of Roman Britain).

Arguably, one could argue by this criteria that England has never escaped subordination since the Norman conquest of England ended with the end of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and the instalment of a Norman aristocracy, and the England since then is therefore the continuation of the Normans... The application of modern geopolitical terms just makes no sense in this sense...

tl;dr You can't be occupied before you even existed...

EDIT: For extra silliness, the article considers the People's Republic of China to have previously been subordinates of the Qing dynasty, whilst also noting that PRC considers itself to be the true successor of the Qing Empire... Also Germany was previously occupied by the WWII Allies but was freed when it was reunified (even though the allies made West Germany sovereign in 1955, with the Soviet Union being the occupiers of East Germany).

If you want the pound, you'll need billions in reserves so you might need higher taxes.

So, taking the last Stormont election, I checked who would be eliminated if there was one fewer seat (removing the person elected on the last count, or elected with fewest votes in the event of multiple people on the last count*), and got the following seat losses:

DUP -6
UUP -5
SF -4
SDLP -2
Green-1

The net result is obviously a large nationalist swing - it's a more significant relative gain than the nationalist parties have made at any election, I believe. In such an assembly the unionist parties would also only control exactly 50% of the seats, putting their majority on a knife-edge which is likely to cause significant consternation. DUP would still be the biggest party and have enough members to single-handedly launch a PoC. UUP probably biggest losers - more than a third of their representatives would be lost, reducing them to the same size as the Alliance party.

I wonder if someone at SF HQ has done the sums on this in more detail and worked out that this line is positive for them in more than one way?

Case in point with Listen last Saturday.  What was the thing on the bed in Dan's room?  Who wrote 'Listen' on the chalk board in the TARDIS? What was outside the doors in the space station/ship at the end?

While sometimes things are just left to speculation, there's a least some closure prior to doing so, to a degree where you  have a few directions to go on versus nothing being answered at all.

Moffat also seems to flop around a lot in writing styles. Not sure how to give facts, but it seems like he flops between serious, silly, etc. a bit TOO much.  One minute the doctor is crying out in anguish over something, and the next he's a goofy clown.  You can have those personality clashes and contrasts in character writing, but the overall story and direction of a show should be consistent regardless.  Does that make sense?

Everything is different even if the positions are almost identical. Its not just the fact that you might have to face the side of the pitch that is on your weaker foot but it is also that all the automatic mechanisms your body has learned over the course of your life, especially when young, like for example how to turn against the opposition, how to tackle the opponent, how to run beside the opponent and outrun him etc are useless. If you have forever turned left at LCB, you will have difficulties turning right as RCB, as stupid as this may sound. Your body is not used to it. At amateur level, this doesnt really make a difference but if there are players, especially fast and good dribbling, running at you and trying to get past your ""weaker"" side, you are basically screwed. Also, you are not comfortable at your new position leading to you drifting more and more into the middle i.e. to the left since this is what you have done at your former position.

Though he may grieve, he's ultimately rewarded). To be fair, I don't recall specifics of 11 like I do with 10 and 9, so please someone correct me.

The Doctor ""not winning"" is fairly common in the RTD run, or if he does win then it's at a cost.

* Midnight - Doesn't win.
* The Satan Pit - Could say he wins, but he never truly discovers what the creature was. He doesn't seem to mind much, but given that part of the Doctor's drive is finding new things, this could be seen as a failure.
* Family of Blood - He dies, effectively (as Smith), and has his heart broken not long after losing Rose.
* Last of the Time Lords - Martha revives the Doctor as she was, essentially, his apostle and led to his restoration. However, at the end of the episode, he's cradling the Master and begging that the Master regenerate because ""[he's] the last one"". Once again, big picture one, but he loses personally.
* Waters of Mars - He loses big time and makes mention of something to the effect of, ""no matter what I do, I can't stop [bad things] from happening"" and is heart-broken enough to invoke the Time Lord Victorious.

These are just off the top of my head; I'm sure there are some incorrect attributions, etc. But I think that's very important of RTD's run: of course, not everything is doom and gloom and the Doctor is wonderful, but it's very important, IMO, to know that sometimes shit happens and you have to cope.

What you meant by ""only"", the subject of hypersensitivity and wither shipbuilding was your only case - which it seems to be since the Royal Mail law is not limited to Scotland but also rural areas of England and Wales (though I accept Scotland gains the most).

Yards in Scotland were awarded contracts for work they were clearly able to cater for (as did Yards in the North of England). It wasn't charity. The contracts were awarded around the same time as the MoD was slashing Scottish Regiments and closing RAF bases. 

Taken in isolation, the contracts look like a bonus, but added to what was taken it seems more like a consolation prize.

I'm sure people in the North of England have similar feelings about how Westminster treats them. The fact the benefits to infrastructure and jobs in the North get are so few it's difficult to find examples of on-line to display is really telling. 

The Tory's gave up on the North when we stopped providing them seats and ""New"" Labour took for granted their working class vote and began to cater to the Southern areas in preference to the North which backfired spectacularly in Scotland with a SNP landslide and low turnout in their traditional heartlands in England.

&gt;There are plenty more.

To execute those you have to have something to aim at; a run to predict and options ahead of him.

He's not going to get that from Balotelli, who doesn't make as many runs and create spaces like Suarez or Sturridge.

So, yeah, he's been pretty terrible, but the return of Sturridge and the improved understanding and confidence of newer team mates will come in time.

Last night you could see he was as confused and desperate as any of us watching. He kept trying to stab those killer through balls into space, but there was never anyone there, but he didn't have the confidence to try snything different.

I do think he is perhaps not quite as great as some might have thought, but he's certainly better than what we have seen so far.

He's also got more competition for his place than ever, which can motivate some players, and simply worry or destabilise others. Sterling can play in his role, so can Lallana.

When he's on form he can be the metronome of the whole attacking line. But when he's not having a good game -- and we saw several last season -- the whole team's fluidity breaks down, our attacks peter out, and we can't find a way past stacked defenses.

But we have to remember that he's still very much a developing talent. Sturridge, Gerrard, and Suarez all had terrible games and sequences of games last season, but they snapped that trend and got back to top form for the majority of games. Coutinho can do the same.

Personally, I think Rodgers should give him a run out wide, where he can get his dribbling mojo back with more space to run into. Then bring him back inside, into more compact areas, to impact the game centrally. This is effectively what Rodgers did with Sterling; Coutinho needs a run of confidence-building performances to get back to his incredible, incisive best.",0,1410967660,null,0,false,0,ckkw3z1,t3_2gnw4h,t1_ckkw3z1,t3_2gnw4h,null,1426960028,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;Where/how? When I bought some 6 odd months ago localbitcoins and exchanges were the only options. 

Localbitcoins. You don't need to jump through any of those hoops. You should know that given that you claim to have bought some from there.

&gt;But I only wanted £50 worth. It's more expensive because less sellers want to deal with such low orders. It was at least 10-15% IIRC. 

Funnily enough, that price of 292 GBP/BTC is for £40 - £146 worth. You can can £25 worth for 295.45 GBP/BTC and £5 worth for 299 GBP/BTC. Localbitcoins has always been about selling small amounts of BTC and larger traders are better served by exchanges.

&gt;Even if it is 4.29%, that's 4.29% I now need to pay on top of whatever product I'm buying purely because I want to use bitcoin. It doesn't sound like that good a deal. Especially when the amount of retailers that accept bitcoin is relatively tiny anyway. 

No, that's 4.29% on top of what you would pay at Coinfloor because you don't want to wait for the funds to clear at Coinfloor and you don't want to arse around with all the documentation and shit that they require.

&gt;I'm not ignoring it. I'm telling you it's completely pointless. Unless I can do something with Bitcoin that I can't do with credit/debit cards or paypal then what's the sodding point? Why would I bother paying all those fees to use acquire bitcoin just to do.... Exactly the same transactions I was doing before. 

You're making bets with people and offering them something which is actually completely pointless. I mentioned an alternative which would allow people to buy Singapore Fried Rice from a local takeaway, and you think that's useless?

There are lots of ways to acquire bitcoins other than just buying them. You can mine bitcoins. You can sell products, services or your labour for bitcoins. You can make useful comments in /r/bitcoin and hope for tips. You can run advertisement banners in you sig space on the bitcoin forums and earn bitcoin.

Also, bitcoin transactions are cheaper than debit/credit card transactions and international bank transfers.

Let get back to the original scenario though, using bitcoin would be the easiest and quickest method for people who already hold bitcoin to pay a bet on reddit. Do you deny that?

&gt;There's only two uses for Bitcoin at the moment that genuinely can't be done with the traditional banking system. Buying drugs, and gambling online if you live in the USA. Basically, illegal shit that banks don't want to touch.

So what if something can already be done with traditional banking? Bitcoin does it quicker and cheaper. Before the Internet, I could write letters to people in Australia. These days, people use email because it's quicker and cheaper.

&gt;And it's always funny to me when you guys try to distance yourself from literally the only decent use of Bitcoin. The only reason it gained any actual popularity was Silk Road and Justdice. 

If you say so, that's obviously why companies like Dell and Newegg started to accept it. That just goes to show how idiotic you anti-bitcoin campaigners are.

&gt;I'm a realist. 

You keep ignoring the reality that plenty of large, legitimate companies accept bitcoin payments. You ignore the reality that lots of takeaways accept bitcoin because they use takeaway.com. The other takeaways that don't use takeaway.com use JustEat for online orders and they're planning on accepting bitcoin too. Yet you, a person who keeps insisting that the only things you can do with bitcoins are gamble and buy drugs, are supposedly a realist. You are no more a realist than I am an astronaut typing this from the ISS. Realists don't ignore reality in favour of their personal beliefs. 

Rather than accept reality, you spread bullshit in am attempt to persuade people to accept your provably delusional views.

You don't want to use bitcoin for you bets, even though it would be the cheapest and easiest method and provide something of actual value to the winner. Don't then, no skin off my nose, I was just trying to be helpful. I didn't realise a was speaking to a lunatic. I won't waste any more time correcting the lies you spew.

true,xeraphine,lfc12,,"Coutinho's been getting some stick on this sub, and while he HAS had some uncharacteristically wayward passes, I think Walsh is right--not only are the players in front of him new, but they are different types of players.

Sturridge, Suarez, and Sterling are all very direct, mobile, and hard-working players. They will make runs and find/exploit space, particularly on the attacking transition. Last year, especially against the top sides, you'll often see us win the ball back, 1-2 passes to Coutinho, then boom--one of the forwards were behind or running at the defense

This year, particularly against in the last two games, you have a combination of more static forwards (with both Sturridge and Suarez out of the picture) and more tightly packed defenses (reducing space further). Suarez and Sturridge are both fantastic at drawing attention away from areas of the pitch which allows the other or another player (Henderson, Sterling) to make runs into that space. We haven't seen that in the last two games from Lallana or Markovic. Balotelli has, to an extent, but he's been far less mobile than I expected.

The result of this (less static players + tighter defenses = less space) is that our attacking transitions and our attacking play are both slower and more patient. As a result, Coutinho's *opportunities* to play fantastic through balls has diminished. Yes, the stats show that he's completing fewer of them. But I would argue that it's as much an issue of lack of space (thus harder to thread balls through) as it is poor accuracy by the player.

I would reserve judgement on Coutinho, and the attacking players as a whole, until they get more time together. We know we're good at quick attacking transitions, but I think we also have the pieces to be devastating with patient probing play against packed defenses. And I think Coutinho is one of the most crucial pieces to that, along with Balotelli. But the team needs to learn to play around the focal point that Balotelli offers. Sterling, Markovic, Lallana, Sturridge--all of these players are quick, tricky players who can swarm around Balotelli and take advantage of the space he creates. Coutinho is the man who can pick their runs out.",0,1410967956,null,0,false,0,ckkw9k7,t3_2gnw4h,t1_ckkw9k7,t3_2gnw4h,null,1426959956,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

In 1290 something William Wallace led a large-scale raid into northern England, through Northumberland and Cumberland. He had the opportunity to march straight down to London, but decided against it. To be fair they probably would have been slaughtered in London.

Robert the Bruce achieved quite possibly the greatest victory of the century in 1314 against the English. It was the first time a medieval army in Europe was defeated by barbarians. That is to say, the English had their armour, knights, bowmen, while the Scottish were pretty much just an army of spear men and some mounted cavalry. After the English defeat at Bannockburn the Scottish invaded England and Ireland, but the situation was eventually settled diplomatically via treaties.


Bannockburn was probably the last big war between England and Scotland. There were lots of skirmishes and small invasions here and there however England found it's self quite busy with Europe and Scotland didn't help by allying with France. In general terms, the union of the crowns of Scotland and England in 1603 was to try and force security for England because of the auld alliance between Scotland and France.

A few of the characters really need some more development, then there's weird scenes which seem totally unnecessary. Matt Smith's nudity in The Time of the Doctor, for example, and the dinosaur in Deep Breath.

I don't disagree that Moffat can't write. A few times, he is shown that he is able to write an excellent scene, but I feel that he excels in individual episodes and not planning out a whole story arc as a whole. Lately Doctor Who seems to be a show filled with some half-arsed one liner jokes like Strax's ""May I take your clothes?"" and other childish humour that doesn't quite come to mind.

Then there's the thing with the dinosaur. There was no need for a dinosaur. Seriously, what does that even have to relate to the rest of that episode? Capaldi standing on the roof spewing out something about how he's sorry about their friendship, then she bursts into flames and that's the last we heard of it.

Some of the best episodes in New Who are Midnight, Blink and Listen. I find that they all have in common are lower budgets compared to other parts of the show. Doctor Who used to be a very low budget show, which mean that they had to capture the audience's attention through actual good writing instead of awesome SFX. And I think that's the underlying problem in Doctor Who right now; that the show needs a budget cut because Moffat seems to write best when he has little money to work with.",0,1410968814,null,0,false,0,ckkwq5i,t3_2gnrdu,t1_ckkwq5i,t3_2gnrdu,null,1426959742,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Years ago booksellers would raid Oxfam. They would look for editions that were worth far more than the local volunteers had priced them up and snap them up and then go and sell them in their own shops.

Oxfam decided to de-risk it for everybody: we will pay you an hourly rate to come in and value the books at proper valuation, and then we will sell them for their full price. So now once a week the local bookseller/expert will go in and earn beer money valuing the donations from that week before they go onto their shelves. If something is a bit special - and believe it or not people have donated books worth many, many thousands - it will get sent elsewhere most likely.

The tool the valuers use is basically abebooks. There is a very formal way to describe the condition of a book in terms of its jacket, spine, boards, pages, etc. and therefore it is easy to find a comparable copy in similar condition and work out the market value taking wear into account.

They seem to have adopted the same style of doing things with clothes, furniture, etc. except wear and condition are much harder to put objective values on, so it's down to the valuation expert I guess.

Can I ask how you are 'not discounting transfers'?

&gt;But, I'm still not sure how impactful this is going to be on the overall community trend - relatively few constituencies come down to a cross-community fight-out for the last seat. 

That's simple to explain - take the votes that went to the last seat and when added to the person that didn't make the cut would it have beaten the guy in 5th? And that's just one permutation.

&gt;From a quick look, of the 11 seats lost by unionist parties under the above assumptions, 7 of them only have unionists in the race at the end - there's no close-run nationalist there for them to overhaul with the extra transfers.

The difference is 5 seats right? So leapfrogging 4 nats in 5th would make quite a big difference in fact.

It works out at just under 32 hours a week. 

Some of my friends used to give me the old ""why wouldn't you want more hours?"" Speech. Until they realised that I get a solid 7 days of, and 5 days off in a row every 28 shift cycle.

This gives me a lot of free time to do whatever I want. I can book 7 days holiday at work and get 19 days off total due to how my shift pattern falls. 

This job is great for me. It fits around my life quite neatly giving me plenty of time for friends and family, while easily providing me enough money to live. The job also involves very little work compared to previous jobs I have done. I basically stand around and wait customers to ask me something, then point them to the information.

Other Redditors feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, since some stuff like workshops got introduced the year after I joined.

Lectures - Someone from the department speaks for about an hour on a given topic. You sit, listen and take notes.

Seminars - Small-group discussions, led by either a faculty member or graduate student (PHD candidate). You sit, listen to other people, take notes, and talk. Most seminars I was in in English had about 15 - 20 people, I expect Politics to be similar.

Workshops - If I'm not wrong, these are just slightly larger seminars.

Tutorials - One-on-one consultations with your tutor. Usually this is for you to talk about ideas you have about your essays, or to get feedback about essays you've completed. Your tutors will also have open office hours where you can drop in and talk about any of their interests - not many people used them when I was there in English, which is a shame, as you can really expand your knowledge by tapping on their expertise.

Contact hours - This refers to the amount of time you spend being taught. Lectures + seminars + workshops. Tutorials didn't really get factored in. 

You'll be fine with the birds. The geese and swans can be a bit terrifying but you can get out of the way easily.

Costa is on fire right now for sure but he only has 2 quality goals that he created himself without any help from a well played pass.

Fabregas has such great vision and passing ability that we only need a semi descent striker up top to dink in goals while him and the rest of our midfield does most of the creative work when it comes to attacking/counter attacking.

Don't get me wrong now. Costa is a physically dominating presence in the box.

However, Costa does nothing on the Spanish National team. Which leads me to believe that he can only be as good as the supporting midfield he is playing with allows him to be.

Sorry, yes, that was a bit ambiguous. In that sentence I was referring to transfers from elected candidates. If there are only 5 seats instead of 6, the quota would be ~1,000 votes higher for each seat, so there would be significantly fewer transfers from many elected members than in a six-seat constituency given equal totals.

As for the exact numbers - sure, it's possible that the unionists would win every marginal-community seat they held under 2011 rules and the nationalists would lose every one making it overall close to neutral.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"Moffat likes questions. He loves them infinitely more than answers and that shows in his writing. Sometimes this leads to good episodes that draw you in and keep you guessing and sometimes it leads you with your eyes squinted and your mind confused.

Moffat also doesn't want people to have all the answers. He wants people to fill in the gaps with their own imagination. He loves a puzzle because they are more fun to crack than straight story telling. He loves non linear story telling, paradoxes, and time loops/skips maybe a little too much at times but when they work right we get Blink and The Girl in the Fireplace.

The whole point of Listen is that it doesn't matter if there is a monster under the bed and at the door. If he gave an answer either way it would do a disservice to the point he is trying to get across. He wanted to focus on the Doctor's fears and curiosity and how far they will take him down the Rabbit hole. It wanted to say that it doesn't matter if something is there or not it is okay to admit you are afraid. 

Stephen Moffat is one of the 90's superfans who tried his hardest to keep Doctor Who alive and in the minds of the public. Contrary to what people think I believe he loves continuity but is not solely focused on the short term. I really think that he is playing the long game. He has even said that he leaves certain stories out or leaves large time gaps between episodes to give future authors and audios a chance to fill them. He also wants to give future writers new monsters and villains to work with which is why he tried to focus on his self created villains like the Silence and the Weeping Angels. One of the biggest complaints people had with Davies' tenure is that he depended too much on older villains to tell the big stories. 

I will agree though that he is sometimes too ambitious with his stories and arcs and his episodes can be tonally uneven. He sometimes likes the idea of a story far more than the minutiae which can make certain episodes suffer. But overall I don't think this is because he is a bad writer or leaves around too many plot holes. But rather that he loves exploring stories and ideas rather than cementing them. 

He is really writing for fans so that they can fill in the gaps. Maybe one day one of these fans will take it upon themselves and fill in those gaps and come up with a better story and a better resolution than he could have.",0,1410972831,null,0,false,0,ckkyvuz,t3_2gnrdu,t1_ckkyvuz,t1_ckkv4qv,null,1426958734,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

1) it was said that if you go into the time stream you die, why would Clara be an exception to that? When we get her back its when she meets the War Doctor for the first time. 

2) She helps the War Doctor to change/save his life. She says she's saved all his lives, we actually get to see this one. 

3) There's similar lines in Listen and The Name of the Doctor. When the Doctor (11) is saving Clara from his time stream he says ""I'm sending you something"" when Clara is talking to the young Doctor in Listen she says ""I'm leaving you something"" 

4) I have this really sinking feeling that Clara is going to die. I know this is Doctor Who and not Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, but there's a lot of character development going on for her. Listen kind of tried to get you to infer that Clara was a great grandparent of Orson, but I think we know with some of the pics we've seen that Danny meets up with the Doctor too and probably has a trip or two in the TARDIS. So the story about his (Orson's) great grandparents could be about Danny and Danny could have realize that it was Clara who gave him Dan the Soldier Man and passed down that story.

So you haven't really 'counted' anything, just stated they would be a factor?

&gt;As for the exact numbers - sure, it's possible that the unionists would win every marginal-community seat they held under 2011 rules and the nationalists would lose every one making it overall close to neutral. But that seems to be a rather stronger assumption than that these things will break fairly evenly between the parties.

It's not just possible, it's more likely given the votes you've discounted are mainly unionist.

Playing a midfield 5 of Fernandinho, Yaya, Silva, Nasri and Milner with Aguero the cherry on the top. I think the value of a midfield 5 against Bayern was highlighted in our previous game against them; when silva came on we started to dominate the midfield.

Also im putting Milner on for his workrate and defensive qualities on the wing. 

I put Navas to come on for Milner in the later stages of the game to test tired legs, Kolarov to come for Nasri if we need more defensive play on the Left wing-also his lethal crossing, and i put Dzeko to come on for Aguero in the later stages to rest Kun and shake things up.

Also i put Mangala on for his debut because i think demi might not have recovered in time for this match, either way i'm happy for demi to play-he has more than proven himself against the big teams.

As for my part of the debt, it isn't my debt. And I'm certainly not getting any benefit whichever way the vote goes. I only care about this because the UK actually used to be a decent place to live, and maybe, just maybe, if the Scots leave, the rest of the UK might have a long hard look at themselves and see what the Tories and New ~~Tories~~ Labour have done to the country.

You guys keep telling yourselves that it's all about the Scots wanting to screw the English. Perhaps that's a little bit of projection? Because the Scots have been saying for *years* that the UK has been screwing Scotland, that this is about social justice not money, and rather than face up to that reality you keep telling yourself a comforting lie that the Scots just want to do to you what you dare not admit you've been doing to them.

Of course things are far more co-ordinated from a Scottish point of view. The No campaign has pretty much all Western governments, media and corporations acting in unison basically giving out veiled economic threats, or maybe even outright threats as things have started getting close. 

It's all very reminiscent of Iraq, it's easy to spot when suddenly everyone is saying the same thing, actually even Iraq there was some dissent from a few Western governments and media organisations. No such thing for Scotland.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"You know ex-priministers basically don't have to worry about either of those things? If you're a PM, you get a Lordship by default when you stop being a prime minister. It just so happens the two most recent ex-priministers happened not to take that option up. Gordon Brown, because he is still an MP (not that he ever turns up to the HoC) and Tony Blair, because he feels as though he would need to treat being a Lord as a full time occupation, which he can't, given that he spends so much of his time running Tony Blair enterprises or whatever he does. I mean, you noticed before Thatcher died that she was called ""Baronnness"" Thatcher, because she was a member of the HoL which she got because she was an ex-PM. 

Additionally, ex-PMs also get some kind of grant for life expenses (I have no idea why) and they can easily make a lot of money working for companies and international organisations, rather than some poorly funded electoral campaign. I mean, one of Tony Blair's many jobs was being the UN or NATO (I can't remember which) representative for the Middle East. Additionally, after William Hague stepped down as leader of the Conservative party, but before David Cameron invited him to be part of his new government, he earned quite a lot of money doing dinner speeches and other boring things. 

If you're a PM, you just don't have any reason to worry about titles or money. 

The only reason Brown would get involved is if he wants to further himself politically (which I doubt given he's a former PM, but is a lot more likely than wanting titles and money) or because he just believes in the campaign. We distrusts politicians, but sometimes, maybe they'll actually do something because they think it's the right thing? It's just a thought.

Pep has his best fullbacks playing in midfield instead of where they should(you know, being fullbacks). I think Navas can have some success against Rafinha. With Milner coming on at ~65' for Navas or Nasri we can keep up the pressure on Bayern's fullbacks.

I was talking about this with a friend and we agree with RTD Doctor Who was his baby. He brought it back, he made it successful. It was his show and his Doctor and being such a big fan he made the Doctor the star. 

Moffat, however, took over an already successful show that had been created and designed by someone else. He wanted to make it his as he would but the only things that were ""his"" were the companions and the new characters, he could write them any way he wanted. Hence we ended up with too many companion based stories. Too many extra characters that were either unnecessary or not expanded upon enough to make the interesting.

It also went more towards lets see how many hidden messages and plot twists etc etc etc we can pack into the series. Which lead to boredom, a tediousness and predictable plot line. (tell me one person who didn't see who River ended up being before it was revealed on screen?!!) 

Also, Sherlock is Moffat's baby. 

I still like Doctor Who but it doesn't excite me as it once did. Shame coz both Capaldi and Smith are both excellent in the role and after Listen I so hope they continue with the Doctor being front and forward and avoid unnecessary companion rubbish that doesn't help move the plot along as was present with Smith.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"The Papal Mainframe = River Song postmortem. I've explained this one before but can never find my previous comments about it. Here's the basic gist, major spoiler warning for seasons 5 &amp; 6 obviously.

For starters, what happened to River in the Library exactly? She ""died"" but her consciousness was saved to the Library mainframe, this was in the 50th century. Then by the 51st century, we know there is a Church of the Papal Mainframe. Coincidence? Perhaps.

Next, think about the Order of the Headless Monks, who appear to be a faction of the Church. It was the Papal Mainframe herself who decreed that their hoods could be lowered at Demon's Run. Speaking of which, what were they doing at Demon's Run to begin with? Yes they appeared to be enemies of the Doctor in that instance, but in fact it was their presence which allowed him his bloodless victory. If he didn't have two sides to turn against each other to create confusion, he couldn't have done it so easily. You could say the presence of the monks benefited him. Even the beheading of Dorium could've been intentional, as the Doctor needs Gantok to be able to lead him to Dorium for information.

That's not all regarding the monks. Also consider the Delirium Archives from the Time of Angels episodes. The Doctor said the Delirium Archives were the ""final resting place of the Headless Monks."" This was the museum where the Doctor found a very out-of-place homebox for the Byzantium, with a message carved in it by River. Yet another massive coincidence!

Now taking into account all of these coincidences, imagine that River were to discover the truth of this. Imagine River, at some point in her travels, realizes that she is responsible for the Silence, for setting the whole thing up including trying to kill the Doctor. Or perhaps she simply realizes that no one else is making these events happen and if she doesn't, no one will. Her first instinct might be to change it, but how can she? It's those very events which led to her creation. If she changes any of them, she ceases to exist. River Song disappears, replaced by Melody Williams. The Doctor dies in the Library, giving his life to save all those people instead of River taking his place. Everything that's happened since the Library no longer happened. Eleven never goes back to save Gallifrey, so the War Doctor properly uses the Moment and destroys them all, and River and the Doctor never get married.

River has no choice but to go through with it; to become the Papal Mainframe and order the kidnapping and brainwashing of her younger self!

Look at last season. Zero trophies, and instead of talks that Mourinho could be on the way out the result was met with content rather than contempt.

We have at least one of the hottest young properties in Europe in Eden Hazard. But our squad is dotted with rising value under-25 players in Oscar, Schurrle, and Courtois.

i dont really agree with your pension opinion,
imo, its a crazy idea not to have one - the govt 113 quid a week is hardly gonna keep you in beans and beers. Gambling on house prices rising for another what, forty years ? that seems mad to me, but thats just my opinion.




When you pay into a pension, you instantly gain 20% extra on top of any money you put into a pension (much more if you are a higher rate tax payer) - so its the best savings account you will ever have, in that regard.  If your employer matches it, thats even better. It's essentially free money. Then on top of that, even in conservative (safe) investments, you should be able to have it double in value every 10 years.

 If your employer also offers a salary sacrifice option (its deducted pre-tax) you gain even more when you put in - as you reduce the tax you pay on it plus getting the bonus - you are taking like 35%. and you want to not use this minimum of 20% gain (plus whatever free money from your employer), and instead put it into a mortgage where the money COSTS you 5-10% instead !? 




to give an example, i was previously paying 60 quid a month into my pension - with employer matching + salary sacrifice + the 20% bonus, i was getting over 220 a month put in , and it cost me 60 quid to do it. You cant get any investment which quadruples in value the moment you put money in like that (i sure wish you could). Even without salary sacrifice you are still talking your money doubling in value instantly due to employer matching.




Given that the government has changed the rules so you can have it all in cash at 55, I dont see why you'd object to a putting in even the minimum till you are 55 - if you have spare cash i'd be putting in at least 10% (moneysaving expert recommends half your age as a percentage) - because even if you dont use it as a pension, thats one hell of a cash pot at 55+ Hell if i could afford it i'd probably put 20-25% in (but i am not that rich, sadly).

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; So you haven't really 'counted' anything, just stated they would be a factor?

I'm not sure why counted is in quotes - I never claimed to count anything related to votes to begin with. The method (as in the first post) was just the quickest estimation from the available data on Wikipedia. I was just pointing out in response to dontthrowstones that there were factors which would both increase and decrease transfer numbers when moving between six- and five-seat scenarios, none of which I made any real effort to take into account.

&gt; It's not just possible, it's more likely given the votes you've discounted are mainly unionist.

This is not immediately clear to me. Focusing on just the votes lost on the final seat elimination is somewhat misleading, as it's very difficult for that to actually make a difference in the result, because it (by definition) happens on the last count when almost everyone who's not being elected is eliminated. For a more robust analysis you have to work all the way back through the steps, taking into account things like reductions from transfers due to higher quotas and potentially different elimination orders, which are much more likely to impact on the end result.

That's much more time consuming and requires more data than I have to hand.

Let's go through each of our roles here.

Me: Live in a houseshare in a fashionable area of London. Have some rooms to rent. After phenomenal demand, we invite a select number of them around to meet us. We narrow it down to a few people, but are struggling to decide between them. We are reasonably drunk at this point. Someone suggests setting them a challenge, and we settle on a drawing challenge. Noel Edmonds is suggested as a subject, purely for the fact that we couldn't think of anything else and it relates to a house in-joke. Receive some mildly amusing responses. Post them to a subreddit that deals with serious topics such as ""which side is the chocolate on a chocolate digestive, top or bottom"".

You: Angry. Very angry. New to Reddit and seem to think it's very srs business. Mortally offended by someone posting some scrawls of Noel Edmonds on the eve of a referendum that's already receiving blanket coverage. Obsessed with the concept of adulthood and whether things are ""adult"". Thinks having children is a defining attribute of a person. Posts walls of texts about how offensive Noel Edmonds scrawls are. Actually says things like ""other people are listening to 60s jazz and drinking scotch"".

Yet here we are in a recovery with dropping unemployment figures, economic expansion every quarter and a controlled level of inflation. 

Of course, throwing your hat in with the European Union would guarantee a stable future for Scotland. It worked so well for Spain and Greece that I'm sure Scotland will have nothing to worry about should they sever ties with the most successful union of countries in world history.

Shetlanders, while generally being pro-Union, have already been polled the last time the Isles' representatives took it upon themselves to sell this nonsense to a bunch of gullible news editors, and the result then was that something like 8% of Shetlanders wanted to stay with the UK, compared to well over 80% in favour of staying with Scotland.

The hypothetical constitutional issues brought up by Tavish Scott and Alistair Carmichael are about as useful a barometer of Shetland opinion as the [notions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_State_of_Forvik) thought up by the campaigner Stuart Hill. It's a cynical referendum spoiler, nothing more.

Us Shetlanders are a fairly pragmatic bunch when it comes to isms of any sort. We'll mostly vote pro-union (I think - to my great surprise, my closest relatives still in the isles are voting 'Yes') but then go along with the result. The notion that they'd voluntarily cut themselves off from what is by far their biggest trading and cultural partner on a nationalistic whim is just a nonsense that could only be sold to people who'd never met a Shetlander in their lives.

* Yaya when making his runs is just fucking fantastic

* Im fucking tired of Vincent Kompany getting yellows from people running into him

* That was an excellent tackle by Dzeko not a yellow, he got all ball

* Im concerned at how often our defense is getting cut through the middle

* Dzeko has been a great target man so far!

true,tittybangbang123,manchester,Manchester,"That is not the only the only reason to care if Scotland votes yes or no if your in rUK.

Allow me to explain why the rUK should have an interest in keeping Scotland in the UK.

- Less clout on the world stage (you think pride and ego right?, wrong) leads to trade agreements (or any) being harder to forge when you loose 8% of your population because the other country may now have a bigger market and a bigger say now in trade negotiations because they have more to gain. 

- This also follows through into the EU Parliament where it's representation by population. This means we get less say on how things are done and less of a vote to cast on new EU laws in the EU parliament. The reason why were able to get significant compromise from the EU and lead other countries in the EU against Germany and Frances decisions is because we're a big country... loosing Scotland puts us on par with Italy.

- If you you travel across borders to work in Scotland it effects you, it also effects you if your business/ the business you work for does business with a Scottish business because now things are a bit un-certain as to what the new corporation tax will be, perhaps Scotland will introduce measures that mean more rights for workers, this comes at a higher cost of business and means that company that previously was going to be able to contract out to you and hire more workers to do so no longer can do that contract work for you... infact until the whole things sorted out it would be difficult to say for sure when a Scottish business if your company has lent them credit will be able to pay back let alone in what currency and if that currency will even be worth as much. This leads to forecasts for rUK businesses (financial) becoming kinda fucked.

- rUK Businesses that have large markets in Scotland will be desperately trying to figure out what the hell is going to happen over the next few years and will likley lose money through inaccurate forecastes (financial, investment choices) which knocks back into the rUK because it means they will have to cut costs which could mean rUK job losses. For example if you are a Scottish firm looking to expand into the rUK market.. your hardly going to start investing in say stores if your in retail if you don't even know the financial outlook of your current market (how much disposable incomde they will have etc..).

- What if your money is in a Scottish bank or a large portion of say stock that you own has a large market in Scotland, share prices could take a hit and their goes your investment that you set up to accrue more money that a standard savings account.

- If you would prefer to stay in the EU or want more chance of a left wing government you should also hope for a no vote.

- Less tax generated throughout the entire UK, this means we benefit less from having more money at the governments dispose for big projects. This also means we benefit less from being able to to invest more straight away or produce more or something in bulk. (It costs less when you produce or invest in bulk to do... can't remember the exact word for it... economies of scale? whatever.) So big projects like Concorde, Aircraft carriers you name it cost more because we will be producing less of what we need (government spending wise). It also means less tax revenue devoted to the R and D budget that benefits us all.

Just because you don't realise the effects it could have on the UK doesn't mean there won't be effects. Do you honestly think Labour, the Lib Dems, and the Tories want Scotland to stay for emotional reasons and reasons of pride? You would be stupid to believe it.

true,SpamUp55,null,null,"I think it depends on exactly what you're looking for. Most people on here are going to be slightly biased towards their home town, so I'll try to keep this impartial.

First of all, I've lived on the Gower all my life, but I'm familiar with most of Cardiff. There's no debate over which has the best city centre, Cardiff is the capital so therefore is bigger, more advanced, and has better infrastructure. This probably goes for jobs too, there'll be a wider range, and generally more available in Cardiff. Swansea's city centre is honestly terrible, out of town shopping centres have taken most of the business away, so it is run down, and very unappealing.

Moving away from the city centre, it's hard to say which is better, as both have some really nice and some really bad areas. I would argue though that some areas on and past Swansea's urban-rural fringe are almost unbeatable. Areas such as Caswell, the Mumbles, Pennard/Southgate and even those further into the Gower are within commuting distance of the City, and offer incredible sea views, friendly neighbourhoods and high standards of living.

In response to someone mentioning the high crime/drug use rates in Swansea, I'd say this really isn't an issue. Unless you hang around the dodgy areas near the city centre late at night, you'll generally have no problem with this. Swansea's crime rates in a report I read recently (no source sorry) were I believe lower than Cardiff's, and definitely lower than most cities of comparable size in the U.K.

To summarise, I'd say that if you prefer an urban way of life, Cardiff's definitely your best bet. If you'd rather live in a sub-urban area without the hustle and bustle that comes with living in/near a capital city, it's definitely worth looking into some of the areas on the edge of/on the Gower. Cardiff would probably be most people's preferred location, but don't discount Swansea because you've heard bad things about Wind Street on a Wednesday night and heroin addicts on High Street, there's a whole lot more to it than that.",0,1410986140,null,0,false,0,ckl69yv,t3_2goerh,t1_ckl69yv,t3_2goerh,null,1426955214,9,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,9

true,OlfredTheGreat,lfcflame,,"&gt;Oh and sign Reus! 

John W Henry's statement. 

&gt;Oh and 

The use of the word 'Oh' reflects J. W. Henry's desire to attract our attention, implying his following statement is one we should take very seriously. Following it up with 'and' gives the idea that his statement is something he had to inform us about, he couldn't forget to mention it, as if adding that at the end of a series of points. This proves that what he said is his ultimate point and adds validity to it. 

&gt;sign Reus! 

The very fact he is using the command verb 'sign', when he is the one who would do the signing, emphasises his desperation to get the deal done, akin to a note to oneself. His ending with the exclamation mark amplifies this desperation, even making him appear adamant. Finally, only using the player's last name, coupled with the punctuation as well as the capital letter on Oh and Reus, portrays the sense of formality and confirms that he would indeed **love to see him playing at Anfield**.

He completely mishits his shot... but it somehow finds its way in! Chelsea had better hope Liverpool can't conjure up a win against United now.

Back to the Liverpool game, and we're into the last minute of stoppage time. Reus—signed in January for free after Dortmund realised how strong his love for Liverpool was—is on the ball. He goes past five United players, gives it to Gerrard, forty yards out, who belts it... IT'S IN!! He's simultaneously destroyed United—who now surrender fourth place to Arsenal—and Chelsea's dreams, while bringing Liverpool's to life! The wait for a league title is over!

true,noweezernoworld,null,null,"Really disappointed here. Here are my thoughts:

**Pros:**

* Hazard was great on the ball, got into space very effectively, and clearly gave 100% effort

* Filipe Luis was a total stud. He delivered excellent crosses, was great defensively, and was very levelheaded with his tackling and his positioning

* Fabregas is still fucking amazing at passing the ball

**Cons:**

* Drogba. Kills me to say it, but christ, he had an awful game. Missed 2 that he should have finished easily. I'm willing to chalk it up to lack of fitness or chemistry or whatever, but I'd like to see Remy start ahead of him.

* Our defense. I have no idea why opponents seem to break through us so much more effectively than last year. But what I do know is that Courtois is being asked to save balls that shouldn't even be getting to him.

* Willian. His technical ability was not on display today. He made some serious errors losing the ball, and also didn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of our midfield.

* Missed chances. Drogba x2, Fabregas, Remy (although it wasn't really his fault)...

Overall, I think we played very well, and created plenty of opportunities to score that we just couldn't finish (sound familiar?). Very unlucky for us. Schalke is no slouch, though, so we can't be too upset.

Work out where they are hanging out and place loads of traps against the walls and in corners.  Wear marigolds when you set the traps to keep your smell off them.

Rat bait under the floor boards works as for overall population control and also works on ""Big"" mice.  The only disadvantage of this is the buggers die in places you can't get to... and then they start to smell.

Cats work up to a point.  I had two until they got run over and I swear to god they brought more mice, rats, rabbits and birds into the house than would have got in naturally. They would bring them in to play with then lose them or just get bored and forget about them.

When you combine that with the social view of ""Not English, Scouse"" that alot of locals, myself included, share you can see that the people that come from diverse Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English stock feel disaffected from the rest of the country and the new nationalistic wave of policies.

true,collect_my_data,EN,england,"I don't think the issue is with Ivanovic, It's with the lack of cover from the midfield and with Gary Cahill. If you honestly believe that Ivanovic strolls out onto the pitch and says to hmself ""hmm, I'm going to go and run high up the field today"" then you know very little about football. Anybody who has watched a Mourinho side over the past 5 years will know he likes a fullback to attack high up the pitch and one to sit back. Watch last season, Azpilicueta sat back, Iva went forward. At Madrid, Arbeloa sat back, Marcelo attacked. At Inter Zanetti sat back, Maicon attacked. Tonight Ivanovic attacked, and Luis, whilst still attacking a lot more than a usual Mouirnho second fullback, sat back more. This isn't coming from Ivanovic, again if you watched Chelsea over the past 5 years you will have seen him defend and attack. He doesnt need to relearn how to be a Chelsea defender or whatever that means, there's no such thing as a ""chelsea defender"", there is a Mourinho defender, It's all down to the manager. 

So far we are playing much more proactive football, in a similar vein to how we played at the start of last year, and it didn't work then. We've played proactive football before well under Ancelotti, playing further up the pitch, with Ivanovic at Right Back, and it has worked. Ivanovic knows how to play this style of football. I don't think Cahill does. I don't think he is comfortable far away from his box, I don't think he knows how to deal with people running at him, he seems to back off until it is too late. I think there was a reason Luiz initially started more than Cahill at the beginning of last season and I think there's a reason we have been linked with plenty of CB's over the last few months. Of course it doesn't help that the midfield is offering little protection and that we seem to be quite unbalanced. And sure, Ivanovic can definitely improve when it comes to deciding when and when not to go forward. But we need to accept that if we want to be more proactive then, for Mourinho, that includes Ivanovic attacking, and that means there will be space and I don't think Cahill is the right defender to play that system, when compared to a Benatia or a Varane. I think we could replace Ivanovic with Dave, but for the system to work, then he'll need to attack and go forward, and that space will be there and Cahill will still have to deal with it, and I dont't think he can, I don't think he's the right type of CB for it. 

Edit: when I say the problem is with Gary Cahill i mean more with how we are utilising him, this isn't an attack on him or anything, and I hope it isn't percieved that way. I think if he played in the position Terry does with more protection from the full back he's more than good enough to play for us and I think in the long run that is what will happen, Terry will leave this year and Cahill will move across and a new CB will come into Cahill's position more in the style of Lucio in Mourinho's Inter team.",0,1410988877,null,0,1410989666,0,ckl7tl1,t3_2gp0ul,t1_ckl7tl1,t3_2gp0ul,null,1426954493,14,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,14

true,nkrera,null,null,"&gt; I think you might be overestimating the importance of fishing in Scottish waters to the Spanish state.

Still, in the case of the UK quotas reducing to rUK ones, and no change in the Irish situation, the Spanish would undoubtedly have some interest in tapping into Scotland's marine resources.

Also, you'd be surprised at the power of people with a unified vote. Coming from Ireland I'm used to seeing that the voting power of farmers and fishermen in action, and it can be very powerful because they organise so well through their national organisations. People can be very motivated politically and can exert a great deal of pressure on a government when their livelihoods are so closely tied to government policy, even if they aren't a numerically very large grouping.

Also, given the large unemployment and significant dissatisfaction with the current government in Spain, as well as the fact that they are due to have a general election in 2015 (before Scotland would officially become independent), it is somewhat likely that a more left-leaning government with greater sympathy towards Scotland would be in power at the time of detachment from the UK.

I just don't personally see the objections of the current Spanish PM (or British PM for that matter) to be a big deterrent to Scottish independence.

Buying a house is expensive, and ties you down for a long time. Renting has *huge* benefits.

&gt; Can you apply for a mortgage with this much debt (assuming I have a decent income/credit history by then)? 

It's all about affordability. Can you afford to repay the mortgage? That'll be the key question.

Also, for money laundering regulations they need to ask where you've got the money from. 

As an aside, I'd *heavily* suggest that you don't borrow £10k at 7% that you don't need. 

Also, you'll want to get a proper handle on your finances:

&gt; (from memory, a repayment of around £80/month)

Over five years that'd be a maximum repayment of £4800, which definitely won't cover £10k. £10k @ 7% for 5 years would be ~£200/month and cost you £1880 over the top of the loan amount.",0,1410989363,null,0,false,0,ckl831x,t3_2gozoq,t1_ckl831x,t3_2gozoq,null,1426954370,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

true,AmazingGraces,null,null,"Hi. How much you can borrow is the lesser of:

A) 5 x you annual income, and

B) 80% of the house value (or 95% if you're using Help To Buy (""HTB"")). This is your Loan-To-Value or ""LTV"".


This is the upper limit of how much you can borrow - most lenders will not offer you as much as this, and will definitely charge you more for borrowing so much. 
 
So you can see that you'll need, primarily, a job, and secondly, savings. 

- For evidencing your employment: 3 months of your payslips is usually required but you can start looking early because the process can be slow. 

- For the deposit: 5% is the absolute minimum deposit, by using HTB. HTB is a essentially a 5yr interest-free loan of 15% of your house purchase price, for properties under £600K, for first time buyers. After the 5yrs, you'll be charged interest. There is absolutely no downside to getting HTB if you are eligible, but it is restricted to new builds unfortunately, and be aware that new builds have usually factored this into the price.

As for your questions:

- Yes, you can have debt, but I'm going to advise you to pay it off first. Use online calculators for specifics on how much you can borrow: https://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/mortgages/how-much-can-you-borrow

- There's no way to know this other than doing the sums. Use MSE's ultimate mortgage calculator to see how much you'd be paying and remember to factor extra costs of ownership - everything that your landlord currently would be reponsible for. http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator

- Ask the bank or a broker.

There's a good deal of difference between a name and their stated or professed aim (religion! good, caring compassion for babies and animal rights!), and what a person or organisation actually does. 

What this particular organisation explicitly says on the harassing posters featured further down their webpage, is that they want to identify ""biomed students who [are] learning to experiment on animals"" - not just those ""operating on animals"" or ""performing surgery on live animals"", but any biomed student learning to conduct *any* experiment on an animal. Would we then really believe that any organisation which uses such poor phrasing and is willing to resort to such dirty campaign tactics really has such a fine grasp of the moral (or even scientific) nuance involved in the range of such experimentation?

Mortgages are based on affordability. The debt could cost you a £1000 a month but if you're earning £100,000 a year it's not going to have a big impact. You can get mortgages even with debt but you need to pass affordability. 

Paying a mortgage and a loan vs a rent and a loan are still likely to be the same outgoing. Or similar. 

Debt consolidation may reduce the outgoings on a monthly basis but cost you more overall as you're paying that debt back slower. ",0,1410989808,null,0,false,0,ckl8bsu,t3_2gozoq,t1_ckl8bsu,t3_2gozoq,null,1426954257,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

There isn't much to say about getting into Bristol that can't be said about getting into the CompSci course at any top uni. Get good grades, prepare a solid personal statement, and impress them on the visit day.

To find out how to impress Bristol specifically, you should look at the [course page](http://www.bris.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2015/computer-science/bsc-comp-sci/) on their website, and make sure you read the admissions statement. For example, here's what they want to see in personal statements:
&gt; In some cases we may refer to the personal statement and reference to differentiate between applicants with very similar academic profiles. If this is the case, then the criteria
will include the following:

&gt; * Evidence of further mathematics/additional academic preparation and achievements;
* Competitions, other mathematical or computer science-related activity;
* Personal factors such as relevant work experience, being given a level of responsibility (eg mentoring, head girl/boy, etc);
* A good standard of written English, expression and construction of the personal statement.

&gt; Overall, you should demonstrate a genuine interest in the chosen course and basic knowledge of the subject, highlighting your
skills in mathematics and problem solving. You should also give evidence of strong study skills, responsibility, leadership and team working, commitment and achievement, both in academic and extra-curricular activities. Any relevant work experience or placements should be highlighted along with any relevant reading/research beyond the A-Level course syllabus.

true,albacore_futures,null,null,"Lewis teamed up with Soros in 1992 as part of the ""crash the pound"" thing. It sounds worse than it really is. Honestly, I don't have any moral problem with it.

I can describe their trade, but it requires a little background on economics. Currencies are traded in relation to other currencies, with the result being called a ""currency pair."" In practice, that means that if you want to buy dollars, you would need to sell the currency you currently hold. If you're British, and wanted to buy dollars, the currency pair you'd want is the GPB-USD. If you're Chinese, you'd want the RMB-USD (RMB is their currency). Currency pairs regularly move against each other, sometimes wildly.

For the purposes of this illustration, all you need to know about currencies is that they are traded in pairs, and that their value is more or less inversely correlated to the amount of that currency in existence. If you print more dollars, each dollar is worth less. If you remove dollars from the economy, then each dollar becomes worth more. This is the essence of central banking, and monitoring the money supply is the primary means by which central banks control inflation.

Basically, what Lewis did: the UK was planning on joining the euro. In order to do join the euro, countries throughout the 80s and 90s gradually regularized their currencies - meaning they lowered the volatility between say the German Mark and the French Franc - to within certain ranges, as mandated by treaty. I believe the range was something around 15% on a year to year basis. The idea is that, on day 1 of the Euro, countries would know at what rate to convert from Marks, Francs, Lira, etc to euro at a reasonable rate. Companies that straddled borders would be able to predict future costs in euros. It was an initiative aimed at predictability.

In order to maintain that currency relationship, the central bank of each country had to intervene in currency markets. Let's say that the Mark was rising relative to the Franc at an alarming rate. The Bundesbank (Germany's central bank) would print more Marks, lowering the value of every Mark, while the French central bank would try to buy Francs and then hold those Francs in its vault. That effectively removes the Francs from the economy, strengthening the Franc, and helping the Mark-Franc currency pair get back to where they want it. The French central bank can't just seize Francs, it has to buy them, and it pays for those Francs by using other currencies that it has lying around its vaults saved up for a rainy day. In this situation, it would probably take say $5 billion US Dollars, buy Francs with them, and then hoard the Francs. But it has to have the $5 billion dollars sitting around. Otherwise it can't buy anything.

Hopefully I haven't lost everyone completely yet.

So, what happened is that the UK was trying to join the Euro. It agreed to certain currency pair volatility rates. During 1992, the pound started getting weaker relative to other european currencies, to the point that it almost broke the 15% volatility barrier (it slid 15% in a calendar year).  The Bank of England started doing standard practice - like the French bank in my example, it started using its currency reserves to buy pounds, which strengthens the currency. However, the Bank of England was woefully underfunded, and it couldn't afford to buy all the pounds it needed to. It didn't have enough other currencies lying around its vaults.

George Soros, and Joe Lewis with him, realized that the BoE would be unable to maintain the pound's strength. So they started shorting the pound (betting it would fall), to the tune of something like $40 billion. The BoE, by contrast, had something like $20 billion sitting in its vaults (don't quote me on that). So Soros bet against the pound in a big big way, which drove it down. The BoE bought the pound for a couple months, trying to save it, until it realized that it couldn't afford to keep doing so and gave up.

The day the BoE stopped its efforts, the pound instantly collapsed. Soros made $1 billion in that single day, on top of the other profits he'd accumulated. Lewis was Soros' business partner.

Critics argue that Soros' bet forced the pound down, thereby causing the crisis he was betting would happen. To an extent, that's true, but several other Asian countries fought back against him successfully a few years later as he did the same thing there. The real issue is that the Bank of England wasn't prepared to support the pound. And there were also domestic political considerations; a weaker pound helps British exports, and at the time Britain was in an economic downturn, so it was thought ""what's the point?""

So that's the story of Lewis, Soros, and making a billion dollars in a day. It's also the story of why the UK isn't in the Eurozone.

I'll also add that Lewis making money in currency trading markets is in no way related to the many, many questionable dealings of Abramovic. I wrote a post on /r/soccer a long time ago that detailed them, but basically Abramovic is the poster child of corrupt Russian oligarchs. He made his money by having connections to Yeltsin (critics would say stealing it from the Russian people at rigged auctions), bought his way into public office so he could lower tax rates on the company he owned, turned on his business partner (whose associate was famously poisoned in London in 2006 or 2007), and then donated his partner's shares to the Russian state, which is effectively giving it to Putin. He was instrumental in Putin's rise - and even championed him for PM at the end of Yeltsin's reign in 1999 - and remains instrumental at home today. His businesses are still in Russia, he still has phone calls with Putin, etc etc. He's as corrupt as it gets.

Tonight was a perfect example of the worst of Yaya.

He needs a kick up the arse, and selling in the summer.

We should've shifted him this summer and brought in a younger replacement to focus on the future. Someone like Pogba or Barkley. And I think we would've had we not been sanctioned by FFP, likewise PSG, as they likely could've taken him off our hands.

Now we'll have to carry this declining ego maniac for the whole season.

If he doesn't pull his finger out he's going to fuck off a lot of people. Problem is I can see him spitting his dummy out if he's dropped, and unsettling the whole camp. I genuinely think he's that much of a cunt that he'd do that.

Probably why Pellegrini is so reluctant to substitute him on nights like tonight.

Precious little cunt.

If he had anything about him he'd be desperate to win us over after his bullshit in the summer.

Whatever happened he was unlikely to ever have a season like the last again, I'm not sure how feasible it would've been to shift him given the sanctions, but I think it made the most sense in respect of his attitude, contract situation, and the need to replace him soon enough for the future anyway.

The thing about the recognition thing which bugs me is that we were one of the few groups who recognised how special a player he was.

He probably had a case about not getting the wider recognition he deserved from the media after the year he had. But that's as far as it goes. You can't take too much of that nonsense on face value as he was clearly trying to force a move.

But we idolised that cunt. Sang his name every week. Put up with his half arsed performances as well.

Threw it all back in our face. In fact he spat in our faces.

I genuinely just think he's a tosser.

If Fernando was fit I'd start him pairing Fernandinho. Can't see Pellegrini dropping Yaya though.

Could be a lot of very angry blues, vocally so, if he puts in a performance like that against Chelsea on Sunday.

Could even get nasty with him being scapegoated if we go behind and Chelsea win.

Hope it doesn't come to that.

true,Daksimus,null,null,"On the 9th of May we trail Chelsea by 2 points and need a win (at Stamford bridge)to have any hope of a title. Earlier that week we drew them 1-1 at the bridge in CL Semis.

The game is tight and nervy with very few chances between the sides, but as the game goes on Chelsea pull back further and further, resorting to the 'prehistoric football' Mourinho used to beat us at Anfield last season. Liverpool grow increasingly frustrated as the game ticks past the 88th minute. Mignolet palms away Chelsea's first real chance of the half and the ball falls near the edge of our area. Jordan Henderson outraces 4 Chelsea players and nicks the ball forward into the path of Sterling who belts up the field. 

A poor touch takes Sterling away from a clear cut scoring chance so he has to cut the ball back to Sturridge. Daniel looks up and fires a very poor shot that John Terry will easily clear before it ever troubles Courtuois. BUT HE SLIPS!!! The ball takes an awkward bounce from the failed clearance and is bouncing some 30 yards from goal. Gerrard, listening to taunts all games is the only one there, arriving late from the liverpool half. He channels all of his emotion from his time at Liverpool and rifles an absolutely unstopable bomb into the Chelsea net as Courtois does not even move.

The Traveling Kop Erupts as Gerrard celebrates in a way he never has before, letting all the frustration out. He obnoxiously celebrates in front of Mourihno who looks like he is about to cry. The game ends and Liverpool go top with 2 games remaining. 

Later in the week, at Anfield a demoralized Chelsea gets ripped to shreds by a hungry Liverpool in the second leg of the Champion's league semi. The final score is 5-1, Mourihno sent off halfway through. Fast forward a few weeks and Gerrard is stepping up to take a winning penalty in the shoot out vs. Barcelona, Liverpool had trailed 2-0 in the 80th but battled back to force ET and pens.

Just sat through 72 minutes of awful Drogba. His general hold up play and attacking threat was woeful. The runs he was making were completely redundant often would get in the way of Hazard and Willian. Luis looked good defensively, reading this thread and people are praising his crossing but I didn't see any of this in my opinion he offered very little going forward. Most of that was left to Branislav. Fabregas had a game of two halves, was running the show like a wizard in the first half but was no where to be seen in the second. Hazard in the first half was just superb but when he got his head up there was no one in the box, drogba often unable to find space in the box.


Management - not sure what Jose was seeing but everyone in the ground could see that Drogba was 2 yards off the pace to every ball. That was evident after 10 minutes. Left little time for Diego and Remy to make an impact on the game. Would not have had Oscar down as the first sub I would have made. I hope the Jose hasn't offered Drogba much in the way of promises of game time, it pains me to say it but it looks like he has picked up where torres left off. 


Crowd - Schalke fans were phenomenal and did not stop chanting all game. They defiantly played a role in the scoreline. Chants of you 'know you're your shit' and 'you only sing when your winning' in perfect english added comic value but from the shed end thats all you could hear.
