Kane in goal for obvious reasons, without Lloris in goal though Kaboul will become confused with lack of orders in French and begin to wander. Kane will learn fluent French at half time though and then we can reshuffle.

Lamela is in the prime rabona shooting spot.

**Episode 1 of 2** The Doctor has been essentially companionless for a while and in this adventure he finds himself on a trading planet in the past. Oddly though he finds a smattering of technology that shouldn't exist yet anywhere in the universe. While investigating he runs into a young adult humanoid alien, Carter, on the run from what appear to be some kind of police force but turn out to be some kind of criminal organization being run by an evil alien monster. **(Series Arc: Carter brings a lone leaf on to the TARDIS.)**

**Episode 2 of 2** To prove to his new companion Carter that the TARDIS can indeed time travel, the Doctor shifts the TARDIS 10,000 years into the planets future. But when they step out of the TARDIS, they find the planet exactly as they left it. Although the TARDIS reads and confirms they are in the future no time has passed on the planet since they left. So the Doctor shifts 100,000 years into the future but the planet is still the same. **(Story Arc: The planet is in a time bubble.)**

**Episode 3** The Doctor and Carter escape the planet and the Doctor sets about to study the readings he made on the planet in the TARDIS. But Carter just doesn't want to sit around and while the Doctor steps away he tries to pilot the TARDIS with the telepathic circuits. Things go wrong of course and the Doctor is unable to save the TARDIS before it falls into a rift in the vortex. In a universal void the TARDIS comes under assault from a Lovecraftian nightmare. **(Series Arc: They find themselves in the void.)**

**Episode 4** The Doctor and Carter travel to a futuristic space port so the Doctor can find some materials to repair the TARDIS after their last disastrous adventure but they find it empty but full of ghostly figures. As they explore something begins sabotaging the station and they think it might have something to do with the ghosts. As it so happens the two of them are out of phase with time and have inadvertently been the monsters destroying the station **(Series Arc: They are out of phase with time.)**

**Episode 5** Time has passed for the Doctor and Carter and it seems like they have run into no end of strife on their many adventures. They find themselves trying to relax on one of the futures' many leisure colonies. Unfortunately the Judoon lock down the station looking for an escaped prisoner whose description supposedly matches the Doctor. **(Series Arc: He never meets the real prisoner who eventually tries to contact the Doctor realizing they are both on the station. All the Doctor hears though is ""the** *static* **is unraveling"")**

**Episode 6** The Doctor gets a call from a young Earth orphan girl Riley (who he had travelled with a few times before meeting Carter) to go to Valor which he had visited not long before running into Carter. When he lands on the planet the day after he had left, he finds the place not a futuristic colony but rather a primitive world and when he runs into Riley finds her to be a middle aged woman instead of the young girl she was supposed to be. **(Series Arc: Time is flowing in different directions.)**

**Episode 7** The Doctor, Carter, and Riley cannot agree on a new place to go so the Doctor develops a new randomizer to take them somewhere new, a place even he hasn't been before. A place that turns out to be cut off from the Time Vortex where many time ships end up marooned in a giant space web. They have to fight a band of space pirates/maurauders who steal the TARDIS while they are exploring one of the other ships. **(Series Arc: They find themselves cut of from the Time Vortex and stuck in a ""web"")** 

**Episode 8** Time has passed for the Doctor, Carter, and Riley and they have been on many adventures together. The way they talk about them, it seems like many of them have been temporally complex adventures with even an off-screen multi-Doctor adventure happening. When they manage to have a normal adventure with no temporal problems the Doctor gets paranoid. He had been trying to study the strange temporal phenomenon that been happening to them lately and hasn't been able to make heads or tails of it. Something must be seriously wrong if they have stopped all of a sudden. He tests it out and they go have another adventure which turns out perfectly fine again (If you can call being shot at, nearly falling into acid pits, and fighting alien monsters to be perfectly fine that is). **(Series Arc: All temporal problems seem to magically stop.)**

**Episode 9** The TARDIS is sick and the Doctor doesn't know what to do. It materializes in fractions, corridors and rooms phase in and out, parts of the console stop working. Eventually the TARDIS tries to dematerialize without the Doctor and his companions. The Doctor eventually finds a leaf floating around the TARDIS which turns out to be the culprit. **(Series Arc: The leaf looks exactly like the one that Carter brought onto the TARDIS in the first place. He admits to the Doctor that he brought it on board at the behest of some mysterious enshrouded figure just before they had first met and that bumping into the Doctor was no accident. He swears he knows nothing else and seriously thought it was a prank. The Doctor believes him; after all they have been through he believes that their is no way Carter could be working against him.)**

**Episode 10/11** Carter and Riley keep on fighting around the TARDIS about his role in their problems much to the Doctor's dismay while he tries to make some repairs on the TARDIS. Eventually the Doctor gets a summons to Earth from Kate Stewart but he knows he cannot risk taking the TARDIS in its current condition. The audience gets scenes on Earth showing what is happening but it doesn't make sense at first. **(Series Arc: The Doctor believes that the leaf was the reason why the temporal problems as it was impacting many of the TARDIS' systems and equipment related to traveling through time.)**

**Episode 10/11** Managing to make it to Earth the Doctor finds invasion forces from various historical time frames in Earth's history appearing out of nowhere. A few Mondas Cybermen here, a few Cybus there, a Dalek or two, some Ice Warriors and Silurians, etc. So far the incidences have been relatively isolated and UNIT has handled them well but they need help before things escalate. **(Series Arc: Somehow the TARDIS is still causing temporal problems despite the Doctor fixing the damaged systems. He again confronts Carter because everything started going bad when he got there. Carter denies involvement and without warning the Doctor psychically links with him finding remnants of another psychic link. Somehow that link got passed onto the TARDIS when Carter tried piloting it through the telepathic circuits.)**

**Episode 12/13** The Doctor has figured out that someone is messing with the Web of Time through his TARDIS, trying to gain control over it. Unfortunately despite Earth still needing his help he goes off to try and find the person. He leaves Kate Stewart with a rousing speech that with her father's spirit inside her he knows she and UNIT can save the Earth without him. The Doctor is in the worst shock of his life though when he meets face to face with another Time Lord. **(Series Arc: The Web of Time)**

**Episode 12/13** But the Time Lord he meets is not the person causing all of this. In fact the Time Lord is from the post-Time War Gallifrey stuck in the Pocket Universe. The fractured Web of Time, the Doctor's trip to the void, and other incidences have allowed the Time Lords to send him as an envoy. He tells the Doctor that if he lets the Web completely unravel the Time Lords and Gallifrey can come back to this universe. 

But the Doctor knows that this carries an enormous risk. He still doesn't know who is trying to unravel the Web of Time and if he lets the person unravel the Web, then they can then rebuild it however they wish. Even if the Time Lords were able to come back they might not be able to stop this from happening.

The Doctor has pinpointed the source of the person controlling the Web of Time in his TARDIS. But he finds out that it isn't being controlled from anywhere in the known and even unknown universe. Someone is attacking it from outside. The Doctor wonders if it is somehow the Time Lords themselves. Maybe it is their last ditched attempt to come back to the universe. But really it could be anyone with knowledge of Time Travel, the Web of Time, and his TARDIS

The Doctor eventually decides that whoever is doing this cannot have good intentions and commits the only action he knows he can take to stop the attack; he blows up the TARDIS. This stops both the temporal problems and prevents the Time Lords from returning yet again. This would be the series end

**Episode Christmas** The Doctor has Christmas on Earth. He is relatively sad but surrounded by some old friends (hopefully some Classic companions would be willing to show up) and now is no longer the only Time Lord in the universe. He eventually has a drink with Kate Stewart (the one he never got to have with the Brigadier) and she gives him a present but tells him not to open it there. Later it turns out to be the piece of TARDIS coral that UNIT had somehow attained.

**Series 10 tl;dr It turns out the person trying to unravel the Web of Time was none other than Omega trying to exert his control over the universe. It turns out that the reason why the temporal problems stopped back in Series 9 Episode 8 is because Omega realized what he was doing could let the Time Lords come back in so he altered his plan stopping for a short time. He accelerated the unravelling of the Web around Earth hoping to distract the Doctor and prevent him and the Time Lord from meeting.**",0,1414187373,null,0,1414187746,0,cliwia8,t3_2k7qbz,t1_cliwia8,t3_2k7qbz,null,1426365771,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

The problem I have though is that the electorate aren't particularly informed today and tend to react to whatever they're told to react to. Yes, it's very cynical, but I think there's plenty of evidence to support the concept, which is, understandably, depressing for everyone. 

Still, while there are many failures in the manifested reality of the EU, anti-Europe sentiment is never going to be particularly healthy for the UK and I think it's probably a better idea to work from within to change the system, rather than go for isolationism and become even disliked than we already are, hurting our credibility as a nation of intelligent people and limiting our power to compete economically with our closest neighbours. 

I, unlike a lot of anti-immigrant people, positively welcome the increased multiculturalism in the UK because of our EU membership. I know there are problems, but nothing I don't believe cannot be solved by patience, reason and unity. 

I also like that I can freely move around the EU. I don't like the fact that I cannot, for example, freely (or at least easily) move to the US, despite being qualified and educated enough to at least begin the process. 

The freedom that comes with EU membership is a great luxury.

Needs are difficult to define.  We're not going to starve, no matter what happens.  We could already just about buy a small house (although we're in London, which I think is nearing the peak of a housing bubble, so the timing is pretty bad).  We don't live extravagantly and we're not very materialistic.  But we'd like kids, which obviously changes things dramatically.

Sorry - I'm terrible at this.  I've always lived well within my means and saved a lot of my income so I've never had to think about budgeting at all.  Personal finance in general has always been my number one failing - I've never been able to get interested in the subject and being lucky enough to have a high paying job has allowed me to get away with ignoring it.

Filling in some of the factual blanks...

I'm more or less halfway between the two asset positions you mentioned: living in rented accommodation but with about £500k, mainly in liquid assets.

I have a committed partner with no assets but a steady job - I think she makes a bit less than £40kish a year.  Neither of us have any debt.

The insurance payout on offer now is taxable beyond the first £30k - it will be much closer to £300k after tax.

There's no great long term insurance scenario, except in the case where my condition deteriorates irrecoverably before I ever get back to work, when I would at least be stuck on my current comfortable £80k income for as long as I need it.  Otherwise, I think it's much more likely that future insurance payouts will be lower as my salary declines, and there will always be the risk of termination at some point.

When considering only the financial risks, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that it would be sensible to take the money and run.  But having a steady job gives you so many non-financial benefits - not least a place in a community of people I like and respect.  Keeping hold of all that - which I may not be able to find again - would be the main object of rejecting the deal.

lol, what?

&gt; The fact that it was flaccid proves there was no sexual intent, no intent to sexually harass her (rape).

He didn't rape her, but he sexually assaulted her. Well, at least according to the definition I'd use, and I'm not a SJW or anything. 

At the very least it's assault, with a twisted form of sexual humiliation thrown in to boot. Being drunk isn't an excuse for that, only utter assholes would get on that way in the first instance. 

&gt; Throw the lack of mal-intent,

There clearly was mal-intent. Just because the guy's too stupid to understand the concept doesn't change that. 

&gt; young age

I know some dumb 21 year olds, but none that would be law students dumb enough to whip their dick out and slap an unconscious girl's face. Maybe I live in a gilded fantasy world, I don't know. 

&gt; alcohol

Don't see what relevance when you even begin to consider the humiliation and uncomfortable, invaded feelings of the victim. 

&gt; I really don't think he deserves the punishment that came with it.

4 and a half months with good behaviour? Not exactly a life sentence, is it? You could argue the criminal record will be a life sentence, but that's the same as any criminal record. Are we banning criminal records now?

&gt; Touching her vagina (with his fingers) would've been far worse under KillingTime__'s scale of naughtiness. 

So would holding a gun to her head and fucking her up the arse and then beating her to death. We can get into a pissing contest about increasing degrees of sexual violence, but they're irrelevant. 

&gt; At least this was for fun.

What kind of immature person comes at it from this angle?

He did at one point try to turn a general distrust of the US government with 9/11 conspiracy level nutjobbery though. Bit of a cheap shot. It seems Brand is abandoning his film and tv career though judging by his now obvious disdain for traditional media.

&gt; The conversation needs to move on to solutions, and Brand always diverted the conversation here whenever it came close to that

Brand is not the guy you look to for solutions, anybody who is looking to a comedian for solutions is a lunatic. It's not a crime to just be the guy highlighting things, making people think differently, waking up the political class to what is actually going on - but instead the media are on a mission to attempt to eliminate his message by constantly railing on this ""what's your solution Russell"" line. 

Criticising Russell Brand for not knowing the specific economic and social policies to change the society we are in now is like criticising Russell Brand for not having the required engineering skills to stop the asteroid coming to hit us - sure he doesn't know anything about orbital mechanics, but despite no-one else doing anything, he's not allowed to shout about it because that was so last year?

In my opinion it is just the laziest possible argument. Nothing is happening to change things in any meaningful way, so he's still shouting about it. I don't expect him to produce a groundbreaking economic study that changes society!

If Suarez hadn't left no one would give a fuck but because he did we became the top story again. We haven't continued our form and that's getting attention. 

We're also playing uniquely poor and signed a bunch of players. 

The fact is most people, including our fans, had very little understanding of why were even good last year. The myth is that Rodgers successfully implemented his approach last year. The reality is that we pressed the shit out of teams (which is part of his philosophy) and then counterattacked rapidly after. We did not dominate possession anywhere near as often as had been suggested. 

Without Suarez and Sturridge we've suffered tremendously because we can't make the most of our opportunities (which then create more opportunities and more open play and more goals). 

Last year we looked better than we were. This year, so far, I feel we look worse than we are. It'll even out.

Livingston could incur a points deduction from the Scottish Professional Football League after the SPFL Championship club allegedly defaulted on payments to HM Revenue and Customs.

The governing body, which had meted out a signing ban already, have opened disciplinary proceedings against the embattled West Lothian club and the case is expected to be heard within days.

News of the SPFL's decision to take action comes in the wake of the Scottish Football Association's judicial panel hearing evidence from Livingston on Wednesday, having brought separate charges against the club as a result of the activities of majority shareholder Neil Rankine. The SFA claim that Rankine also holds an interest Dumbarton and East Fife, meaning that Livingston has breached five rules. The case has been adjourned until November 7.

Officials at Livingston are understood to be bracing themselves for the repercussions of defaulting on tax payments, with the case due to be heard by a SPFL sub-committee. A source close to the Livingston board said: ""Livingston fear they will be handed a points penalty.""

The club are understood to have admitted their wrongdoing to the league, they were given a transfer embargo on August 12. In a letter to the SPFL signed off by the Livingston vice-chairman Robert Wilson, it is alleged that the former chief executive Ged Nixon - who resigned last October after a fallout with Rankine - paid undeclared bonuses to players and then manager Gary Bollan in 2010 and 2011. Both the players and Bollan deny receiving such money.

Prior to that declaration, Nixon launched legal proceedings against the club in a bid to recoup a £311,000 director's loan. That case is due to be heard in March 2015.

&gt; We must be clear: to defeat the ideology of extremism we need to deal with all forms of extremism – not just violent extremism.

&gt; For governments, there are some obvious ways we can do this. We must ban preachers of hate from coming to our countries.

&gt; And we must stop the so called non-violent extremists from inciting hatred and intolerance in our schools, our universities and yes, even our prisons.

To me, that seems to state pretty plainly that any third party intervening has to pay any costs (meaning lawyers fees to respond) incurred by anyone else as a result of their intervention.

Look on a map, most of the bigger green areas have something to offer if you like lakes, rivers and walks. Explore. Our parks are very nice, and too many to mention.

Walking again, most stretches of the canal are nice, just remember you have to walk the same distance back.

Howe Park Wood is smaller than some of the other woods, but still a nice place if you aren't too far away.

The art gallery in the centre (just outside the theatre) often has interesting exhibitions although it is quite small.

On the outskirts, Woburn is quite a nice village, lots of antique shops, the abbey and deer park. The safari park is good too.

She told me to come back in 2 weeks to make sure it didn't end up being even longer. 2 days after my appointment I got the appointment letter for the week before, and when I phoned to tell them this they said I had to be lying since they sent it out in enough time.

Mason doesn't even factor into the conversation. A quick look at wiki will tell you that he's made of glass. He's too smart to be played on a Hodgson team anyway. 

Paulinho had Ramires, Fernandinho, and Luis Gustavo as competition. So yeah, the competition's hardly stiff when Ramires is the only other box to box midfielder and Scolari knows Paulinho from managing in Brazil all those years. Not hard to see why Paulinho gets the nod.

Did you watch Brazil's games at all? 

He was either partnered with Fernandinho or Luis Gustavo. If that wasn't the case, he was subbed on for one or the other.

Injured and slow. They already had two quality *defensive* mids in Fernandinho and Luis Gustavo. So moot point is moot. 

&gt;fernando

Another defensive mid, doesn't cover Paulinho's position. 

So no, he had no real competition for that box to box spot. If Paulinho's name was ""Jean-Paul Petit"" he wouldn't have a chance. 

And there's a reason why they looked dire and unconvincing in the World Cup. Scolari sucked and left out Miranda and Filipe Luis, along with over reliance on individual skill rather than working as a cohesive unit.

Well, that's just not true. Kane sat right behind Soldado in Europa and I think Forest.

Just kidding. I don't know... going into the game I thought I saw a fair dose of reality on this sub - Real were clearly the better side by a wide margin. Our starting 11 may not have even been worthy of their bench. I think that was 100% clear to many people. 

Yet we lose, and it's like everyone is in panic mode. Time for some tit calming. 

A few things should have been crystal clear before this season started: 

* We were not going to be as good as we were the 2nd half of last season

* Suarez would be a huge loss, not just in terms of goal scoring but also in assists and overall mentality. When the team kitted up with Suarez, they felt like world beaters because he was one. Without him, we are lacking in physical and mental ways. 

* We will be incredibly reliant on Sturridge, who has always been injury prone

* Our summer singings were mostly (Lallana &amp; Balotelli being the exception ) based on future potential and fit versus current form and talent. We seemed to all be on the same page during the summer

* Balotelli - he is a physically talented player who has never been high on footballing IQ, and can tend to get down on himself. It felt very clear what his role woudl be when watching the Tottenham game, he is a good physical foil for the fast running Sturridge &amp; Sterling. Without Sturridge, it is a bit much to ask him to suddenly change and become an intuitive runner and passer


When you take all of the above elements, we should have known (and again, I felt mostly everyone did) that this first half of the season was going to be tough. 

TL;DR - it was always going to be an uphill battle this season, and our squad was not designed or expected to be strong these first few months. ",0,1414207876,null,0,false,0,clj4lzi,t3_2k85oh,t1_clj4lzi,t3_2k85oh,null,1426361934,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

false,VAPossum,null,null,"In America, sadly, child beauty pageants are a thing, especially in the South.  TLC (short for ""The Learning Channel"") has a series called Toddlers in Tiaras that's a quasi-documentary about some of these girls and their mums.  Honey Boo Boo (real name Alana), a girl from a self-proclaimed redneck/hillbilly family, was one, showing up in 2012 (then aged 6 or 7).  

Her mom, ""Mama June,"" feeds her ""go-go juice"" before pageants--a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull.  Honey Boo Boo's favorite food is ""sketti"" (spaghetti), and she's a seriously sassy kid--she says things like, ""Honey-*chiiiiiiile* and snaps her fingers.  She also likes to show off her belly a lot.  It's both disturbing and oddly amusing, and she, herself, is both disturbing and oddly adorable.

Anyway, she and her mom were so popular, she and her family quickly got their own show, about their lives on and off the pageant circuit.  Most people consider it the low point in TLC's history--they used to run shows on space and how things were made; now it's rednecks hopped up on sugar.

Despite the bizarre nature of the show, there's something about the family that just resonates with a lot of people.  Part of it is because they've stayed really humble, with people who've met them commenting on how they're funny and warm people, and with them actually being wise with the money they earn for the show:

&gt;The family makes about $15,000 to $20,000 per episode, and instead of squandering the money, Mama June has put it into a trust fund for her four daughters and granddaughter. The only way they can withdraw money from the accounts before they’re 21 is for schooling or medical emergencies.   The one splurge they’ve made is for a 2005 Ford Expedition SUV.

(That means they didn't spend the money for a new car--they didn't get their own show until two years ago.  The car is the same age as Honey Boo Boo.)

The show documented Mama June's engagement to a guy, but it ended, and now she's dating a new guy--who is apparently a convicted child molester and registered sex offender.  TLC just dropped them like a hot potato.

I don't recall Balotelli and Lambert starting a game together and I believe it would allow our playmakers more options going up the pitch. Balotelli has specifically stated that he plays better with another striker, and Lambert needs an opportunity to prove his worth. Couts and Lallana showed an impressive link-up during the Madrid match. Hendo can come in later for Lallana. I believe Johnson's performances has been very solid since coming back on the team, but Manquillo deserves a chance to perform as well. He hasn't had a overtly poor performance since joining the team. Sterling is obviously missing, but I think he needs rest. I would like Gerrard to get some rest, but he'll obviously start the game.

Looking at that plan, going straight is actually a minor road junction. You should be able to treat the L shaped road as a stright road with the following:

- If you want to go turn right following the main road, you should be on the right lane. 

- If you want to turn left or go straight, passing a junction (dashed lines in both cases) both  you should be on the left lane.

- If you are on the left lane and continue on the main road, you can, the road curves, there are no dashed lines indicating a junction - althought this would not be the optimal place to be since you will be in the way of people trying to join the main road and trying to get off the main road  through the junctions there.

This is similar to a roundabout. It is actually an infinitely long straight road curved into itself with T junctions at every exit.

Yes, there's an ""information deficit"" and a systemic disenfranchisement in our so-called ""Parliamentary Representaton elections."" But this will INCREASE in the EU ie the solution to a lack of democracy is MORE (active) democracy. The direction of the EU (Check: ECSC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU -&gt; Federal Superstate (USE) towards **Centralization** of governance and ruling and administration is deeply flawed and lowers democracy in the UK. Eg our national elections, we don't vote on policy powers. Our influence in the EU is very low:-

^theproblemsihavepostingthisinformationinreddit...dodgy

Coming back to the above, I wrote, the problem is the Treaty Structures as you can well conceptualize:-

* 28 diverse, different, delaying, indecision, disagreeing members with different needs and wants
* EU Instutional procedures via Treaties: Commission vs Council &amp; Parliament

= Scope for reform WITHIN Treaties is very low. It's too big and unwieldly. Secondly the ideology that rules the EU concept is the Treaties are broken themselves and the ""colleagues"" dare not put them to a Referendum for fear of breaking the entire ""Engrenage"". Proven.

&gt;*Still, while there are many failures in the manifested reality of the EU, anti-Europe sentiment is never going to be particularly healthy for the UK...*

I disagreeing: Democracy is all about being argumentative but honest in your debate and discussion. It's healthy and when things go wrong (EUROZONE Crisis: Saying what is good AND what is bad) it is vital. In fact if we look at dealing with the EU: Inside we have political pressure as a block of 28 to ""conform"". Outside we negotiate as ""Co-equals"". Even forgetting that the UK punches substantially BELOW it's true weight in the EU than out.

&gt;*rather than go for isolationism and become even disliked than we already are, hurting our credibility as a nation of intelligent people and limiting our power to compete economically with our closest neighbours.*

But if we move out of the Political Union and Treaty Prision, we can join our neighbours Norway and Iceland (geographical and trade) in the EEA/EFTA and still be active parts of Europe. In fact if we look at Europe:-

[The variable relationships of European states: From EU -&gt; EEA for UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supranational_European_Bodies-en.svg)

&gt;*I, unlike a lot of anti-immigrant people, positively welcome the increased multiculturalism in the UK because of our EU membership.*

London and more recently rest of the UK have been a successful Multicultural Society and Polyglot mix of cultures. The fact is that you have it the wrong way around:

1. Mass Immigration
2. Political Correctness

= Rotherham Abuses and all the other anti-mass-immigration problems and disquiet and failure of democracy for &gt;15yrs.

Rate is the problem as is the failure to engineer a coherent system.

&gt;*I also like that I can freely move around the EU.*

You'll probably find that that is still possible in the EEA and after the EU is gone.

&gt;*but I do hope we remain in the EU all the same.*

Obviously there will be circumstances, on urban roads where you can go upto around 40, but just be sensible - you don't really want to be doing more than double the speed of the cars you're overtaking. Another thought that passes my head a lot is the fact that I won't put myself in a unnecessarily dangerous position if I don't need to; if someone looks like a liability - I will hang back. If there is say only 2-3 cars in front at a set of lights - I will hang bang. 

I filter on a geared 50cc enduro bike, and although it's light the bars and mirrors are pretty wide - getting to the front at lights means as soon as it changes I can be ahead. 

Quite obvious but never go over a solid white line, always try and stay in your own lane. Never go around the outside of a traffic island, even if some twat has decided to pull up to it to block you off. You can cut in front of cars if you need to get back in, but don't be a dick about it.

Insurance, particularly car insurance, must be the single biggest rip off in this country. Since it's compulsory, first of all they know they can what they want. Competition in the industry seems to mean nothing when it comes to lowering of prices. Secondly premiums are routinely priced annually at more than the car is worth. This could be somewhat understandable if you were to wreck an expensive car, but then on top of all this they charge an 'excess', which can be anything up to £2,000. So for 90% of claims it just isn't even worth bothering to claim, and makes much more sense to just deal with it privately. I sometimes sympathise with people who make fraudulent claims because these some of these companies deserve to be ripped off for everything they're worth. It's like a frigging cartel.

Scotland can already spend more on NHS Scotland. It has full control over it's own budget. It can choose to spend less somewhere else and more on the NHS if it wishes. It also has more tax-raising powers coming (being able to increase or lower income tax by 10p) so it it wants more services it can directly charge people more or give them a tax break. 

And the whole ""nation of nations"" thing is a colloquialism. The UK is the only internationally recognised nation.

Nando's is fine. Granted, the quality is not always consistent and occasionally you do get the chicken that hasn't been left on the grill long enough. But I think you entirely overestimate the quality/value of a pub meal. For a tenner I can leave nando's having eaten half a carcass of chicken, chips, and some veg. To get a meal in central London at a pub (bar wetherspoons), you're looking at like £12+ for just some pie and mash. Perhaps nando's isn't as good value as you work your way towards the regions--where you might be able to get the equivalent meal for £3 less--but the atmosphere is nice for what it is and not everyone wants to eat dinner in a pub. Equally, not all pubs do good food. 

Yes, nando's is just chicken. But I don't think its ever tried to present itself as anything else. Heck, that's its logo.

&gt;Because devolution of tax to the various regions in the UK would mean less for Cornwall. London would have tax devolved, Scotland, and so on. How would Cornwall cope? If you lived in Cornwall would you think it was fair?

This just proves that you don't understand how devoultion or the Bartnett formula works.

Scotland is a nation, London and Cornwell aren't nations. Do you honestly believe that devolving tax powers to Scotland would reduce funds for Cornwall? That is not the case. You need to look up the Barnett formula it's clear you don't have a good understanding of how revenue and spending works in the UK. I think English taxation should go to England, Scottish taxation should go to Scotland and so on- why ?  Because we make different decisions on agriculture, the NHS, housing, transport etc. So it's logical that we should decide how to finance these decisions separately otherwise it undermines these decisions.

&gt;And I am in favour of devolution, though not everything to every level. Nor are you, since you balked at the idea of devolving revenue to Aberdeenshire.

You just don't know what you're talking about really. You think that Scotland is on the same level as London and that says it all. You're ignorant of the difference between a nation and a city. You also didn't understand what I said about Aberdeenshire you just changed what I replied to be what you expected. If Aberdeenshire were it's own self-determined state with powers over the majority of political decisions in it's own parliament with it's own legal system and health service etc, then of course I would support devolved revenues to Aberdeenshire.

&gt;A Scottish Parliament doesn't really represent the people of the Shetlands any more than a UK one.

Mangala was average, and has been sense his debut v Chelsea. Kompany should probably learn to chill the fuck out, it's like he wanted a red.

1)**Slowing the game down.** Our counter attack game has been ineffective, which has to do with opposition sides being ready for us. I believe that if we can have some possession and not just throw the ball away by trying to create something out of nothing, or just going super direct, we can cut sides to pieces. Against QPR when we looked our most dangerous when we had slowed down and not gone as direct we started to cut through their defence. 

2) **A clean sheet (OBVIOUS).** We have been extremely poor with letting goals through and majority of them have been weak goals that could have been defend better and/or dealt with prior. Obviously we would have had a clean sheet at Everton but a wonder strike beat us, besides that there can’t be many cases be made that we were unlucky.

3) **Defend a set piece and clear the ball.**  QPRs  tactic was clearly get a free kick they feel un-comfortable  when its goes anywhere near the box.  The one piece of defending that stands out is how the QPR player (can’t remember who) had three bites of the cherry and still got a pass off all whilst our defenders watched and felt powerless to intervene.

4)**3 points**

5)**Mario to tap one in from Sterling.**

I think this game could be one to give us a kick that we need and start turning the corner.

false,Dardanator,null,null,"This doesn't come as too big a surprise to me. Scotland is getting more autonomy within the UK and it's very conceivable that this referendum has put the whole country on the path to decentralisation or even federalism. But the political parties haven't followed suit and have remained top-down organisations. If decentralisation is to work successfully the political parties need to divide themselves as well and grant more power and autonomy to regional divisions, perhaps even going as far as becoming separate parties that work closely together.

I think this is something the Scottish Conservatives already know. At their last leadership election, one candidate ran on a platform of making the Scottish Conservative Party independent of but still allied with the UK Conservative Party. Indeed, they need only look at their own history in Scotland where, between the 1920s and 1960s, the conservative party was not active in Scotland and instead the right-wing Unionist party was one of the dominant forces in Scottish politics. The Unionist and Conservative parties worked very closely together in parliament and a number of Unionist MPs held senior government positions. But the conservative vote in Scotland declined after the Unionists merged with the Conservatives, with many going to the SNP or Labour. Furthermore, the fact that Northern Ireland has its own political parties has never stopped the UK parties from working closely with them, while the Conservative party's attempted coalition with the UUP at the last election led to the UUP's worst performance as their only MP left the party and retained her seat as an independent.

I think the only way to resolve this issue is for the Labour party to embrace decentralisation, and for the other parties to do the same, and give the Scottish and other regional divisions proper autonomy. For the conservatives that might be the only way they can ever be relevant in Scotland again. Otherwise it might instead end with dissatisfied Scottish Labour members abandoning the party entirely and founding their own Scottish centre-left unionist party that the Labour party has absolutely no relation to. Though such a situation could work out if this party continued to work closely with the labour party, like the Unionist party did with the Conservatives, the fact that it came about as a result of animosity toward Labour would make that difficult.

I think canadian politics seems to adopt a decentralised model for parties. As far as I know the parties that stand for seats on a federal level are separate parties to those that stand on a provincial level, but remain allies. Eg the canadian liberal party, quebec liberal party and ontario liberal party are all separate entities (not certain if that's the case but that's what I've noticed). Even the separatist Bloque Qebecois only stands at a federal level and Quebec has a different separatist party for the Provincial level. A similar situation could be the SNP only campaigning for seats in Westminster to put a Scottish nationalist voice in parliament but separating into different parties in Holyrood to give proper representations to the different ideologies within the SNP.",0,1414245547,null,0,false,0,cljcv3s,t3_2k8nmj,t1_cljcv3s,t3_2k8nmj,null,1426357933,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There are more than 10 different concepts to learn, which all have to be implemented and practiced, etc. There's 4 different maneuvers to learn for a start, which then have to be practiced pretty extensively because they're a massive part of the actual test.

8 hours years ago sounds about right. I know friends who did 5 or 6 lessons 15-20 years ago and passed first-time, but the test now covers tons more stuff and is a lot harder. Not to mention you also have to do your theory test which is usually done in conjunction with practical lessons so that adds a bit of time on.

My first two hour lesson was spent pulling away from/back into the kerb, and then driving and turning left only. 

I highly doubt 10 hours would be anywhere near enough time for a brand new driver to pass their practical test. 10 hours really isn't a lot, and definitely isn't enough to even get used to the possible routes you could be taken on.

I think 30-35 hours is about right for a driver.

If your friend did 10 lessons then it sounds more likely that he did a crash course of 10 lessons, rather than 10 hours (standard lesson is 1 hour).

Reportedly Thatcher went in and said 'I want my money back.' 

Blair then offered to give 20% of the rebate back from the period 2007-2013 in return for CAP reform which didn't happen. As we are now in 2014 and now getting the full rebate it seems like this is ann EU play to get that money back.

Look at the [2011 Holyrood election results](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011#Result) for example, it would appear the biggest factor contributing to the SNPs massive win was people deserting the Lib dems. Labour's vote share declined slightly and the conservatives' by slightly more, but the Lib Dems lost over half of their share of the vote in both the constituency and regional polls. The SNP gained 23 seats and the lib dems lost 12 - they suffered bigger losses than any other party despite being the fourth largest to begin with. A repeat of that at the next UK or Scottish GE would spell oblivion for the lib dems as a political party in scotland.

It's interesting that a lot of the change in voting habits and party sizes in the uk lately, such as the surge in support for the SNP and UKIP since the last general election, seems to have coincided with an absolute collapse in votes for the Lib Dems while Tories and Labour haven't suffered nearly as much. Perhaps the lib dems have been popular for years as they've been seen as the alternative to Labour and Tories, but after entering into a coalition they've become seen as just as bad and people are looking more and more to other parties for the alternative. However the results I posted from the 2011 election don't strongly endorse the idea that the SNP made most of their gains from dissatisfied lib dem voters. By far the majority of the SNP's constituency gains were from labour, but labour made up for it slightly on the regional list, gaining seats from the SNP (despite the SNP coming top in every region and increasing their vote share - I don't understand how this works). However even on the regional lists the Lib Dems usually saw the biggest decline in vote share of all parties. Perhaps it is possible that an SNP gain from Labour in a given constituency was made possible mostly by former LD voters turning to the SNP rather than a massive decline in the labour vote.",0,1414246908,null,0,false,0,cljd9rp,t3_2k8nmj,t1_cljd9rp,t1_clj8yxu,null,1426357744,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Oh Nip+Fab. They seem like a company that's just full of fluff and more fluff. I've tried repeatedly to ask for information about the efficacy of their products and everytime I've been rebuffed. But they've surprised me with three products.

* *Post Workout Fix* - Granted, it's just the menthol doing most of the work (okay, all of it) but it really does soothe my muscles. I would never buy this at full price, but it's a handly little thing.

* *Glycolic Fix Pads* - The percentage is so low, but I really think it's a perfect first AHA to ease you into the world of chemical exfoliation. Comes with pre-soaked pads and is gentle enough for every-day use, seriously handy stuff. 

* *Overnight Wrinkle Fix* - This is my first retinol, I bought it so cheaply that I didn't expect it to work. Bloody hell has it worked and then some. My CCs melted away after a week and there's just one stubborn circle of them that's left. But I can feel it drying up and jogging on. 


###Eucerin

Everything about this brand makes me happy. Everything. They're actually a science based skincare company. Have a look through their website. I've used three products in their Oily skin range and I loved it. I had an issue with another product that I incorrectly attributed to their product. They were so keen to help me, going above and beyond he make sure my skin was fine. LOVE THIS BRAND.

Last I checked, though this was quite a few years ago, the average constituency population in Scotland was smaller than that in England or Wales and presumably much smaller than that in London. The result being that Scotland would have more MPs in relation to its population than other parts of the UK. An extreme example of constituencies with small populations is the rotten boroughs. That term referred to small towns or boroughs that were their own constituencies, meaning that someone could enter parliament by devoting all of their campaigning efforts on winning over only a few thousand people in those small constituencies yet enter parliament with the same influence as an MP who had to spend a far greater effort on getting elected in a bigger constituency. As a result, rotten boroughs were used as vehicles for people to enter parliament and promote their own views on certain issues with their disproportionate influence, and rotten boroughs were eliminated in boundary reforms.

However one point of note is that many of the constituencies in the Highlands or on the Island communities are very sparsely populated, and if constituencies here were sized to contain a higher population more in line with other uk constituencies then they could be far too large for one MP to represent the whole constituency reasonably without having to devote a hell of a lot of time and money to travelling around.

As long as you show them you want to work and you need to be independent financially with work you will be on their positive side completely.

Dont come in scruffy. Come in semi smart at least (just what you would usually wear but nothing track suit like) 


If they know you are searching for jobs and asking the right questions they have no reason to be suspicious of you and slap any sanctions on you 

For example i had 4 job interviews in one week and applied the previous week for 6 jobs and i said to them ""would you like any further evidence of these scheduled interviews rather than just my notes?""

to which their response was "" we trust you enough with your initiative and your attitude so notes will be fine :) ""

Fernando was taken off the ball too easily to be effective.

Mangala looked very raw out there, but we knew that when he was bought and the Chelsea game showed us how good he could be. We need to stop fucking around with our back four when we have a young player that needs to adjust.

Toure looked like someone woke him up after Jovetic came on. Not a wholly terrible game for him, I guess. He needs to keep playing like that.

Navas was trying but ultimately didn't do much.

Also Silva needs to stop playing on the left. This match just shows us how much we need a good left winger and how good an addition Reus would be to the team. I hope we try our hardest for him next summer. 

However, I feel the biggest flaw is Pelle. He's a great manager and it would be a massive mistake to even start pointing fingers, but he seems to have a Del Bosquesque stubbornness to drop the players who helped us to the title last season or to abandon his beloved 4-2-2 when 4-2-3-1 has us playing at our best. Teams have found ways to exploit our two man midfield in both Europe and the league. We are essentially playing with 9 men when Yaya and Dzeko are having a shit game.

He knows these problems and does nothing about them. I think it's a better idea for him to start making changes rather than hoping that the same players and formations will come good in time. You can even see this with his hesitation to make substitutions until the 60th minute or so.

Silva plays well on the left so I'm surprised to see people saying not to play him there. Sure he's good behind the striker but usually Aguero plays behind Dzeko. Dzeko seems like he had a rough game?

Clichy also sounds like he didn't play well.. Is it time to move him on at the end of the season? I have never found Kolarov to be especially good defensively and see him more of a wing back than a left back.

The Doctor is so alien, and not in the sense as he's a mysterious enigmatic entity of a different species, but rather in the sense that the writers are having difficulty exploring who Calpadis Doctor is and how he shines. My thought was what if we saw different come anions in each episode with maybe a two parter or two. Writers would really get to explore different personalities and situations that could really flesh out The Doctors personality through the way he acts to these different people in different situations, this particular thought is influenced by how he interacts with that soldier that he saves in the beginning of episode two of this season. Not only that but it could open up the idea of some alien companions, though I get the argument for companions needing to be Human for us to relate, maybe we don't need that to explore The Doctor.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"One single source of clean energy will never be the solution. Instead it will be a combination of 5-10 different sources including wind, solar, tidal, wave, biofuels, nuclear, hydroelectric, geothermal and perhaps the production of synthetic carbon neutral fuels made from atmospheric carbon transported by electric vehicles making the whole process totally carbon neutral. Failing to kick start the industry by 'just accept[ing] pollution will increase and adapt[ing] to any changes' will ensure that none of these technologies ever become viable in the long term. In the mean time we can import green energy from other places. North Africa would be happy to sell us solar energy and it might benefit the region making it more prosperous. Iceland might be able to export geothermal energy to us. Sweden uses its rubbish as fuel and imports rubbish from Norway because they burn more than 100% of it. If they can do it, we can and in the mean time they might be able to export electricity to us.

I hear it a lot but why do people who oppose green energy on economic grounds not consider the huge boost we could get by being a world leader (and major exporter) in renewable energy. Exporting energy in the form of fuels is a huge money maker for countries like Russia, the US, Canada and most of the Middle East and it could be for us but in form of electricity. We have half a continent desperately wanting to reduce it's reliance on Russian gas and most of the world is tired of oil production being hurt by the clusterfuck in the middle east and the UK and Western Europe could be the answer. Politically stable, no dictators, strong economies, low risk - we would be the most sought after energy exporters in the world if we could get our act together plus the government would tax every company that profited.

Yesterday I went to Boots to return a crappy Sleek mascara which I found unacceptable and exchanged it for L'Oreal goodies. I bought my trusty False Lash Flutter mascara which never, ever lets me down, and their [Super Liner Black Lacquer](http://s4.thcdn.com/productimg/0/600/600/87/10823287-1374249063-691347.jpg) which I had been reading was a dupe for my usual Lancome Artliner which I just couldn't afford yesterday. Because it was three for two and I needed a deep berry nail varnish for my date last night, I saw their [Infallible Nail](http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/make-up/nails/infallible-nail/016-forever-burgundy.aspx) on the shelf, was curious, and gave it a quick google whilst stood there. I came across [this](http://www.reallyree.com/2014/07/l-oreal-paris-infallible-nails.html) blog post which got me pretty excited: *This is the most excited I have been about gorgeous glossy nail colour…ever I think! L’Oreal have cracked some serious new technology here which will bring us ‘at home’ gel nails with no hassle at all. With L’Oreal Paris Infallible Nails, we are looking at a high gloss result, a super tough finish and up to 12 days wear. Also, they are super fast drying which makes everything really easy.*

**Rave**: ohmygod the liner. They do several which are called Super Liner so if you are after it, make sure you get the right one. It has a foam tip. **I think it's better than the Lancome artliner** for the following reasons: 1) it's waterproof whereas Lancome's is not 2) when I removed it last night (with Nivea's double effect and a cotton pad) it came away completely; it sort of chips off in small chunks. Not one trace of it was left. Nada. None. I was stunned. My Lancome has always been a pain in the arse to remove and often I'm left with a bit there when I got to bed. 3) price: £6.49 versus £20.00. The only thing I can't comment on yet is its waterproofness: I need to be out in some wind to see how it fares, but the Lancome smudges all over the place. You can get the thinnest [line](http://imgur.com/RJXbGVe) from it, and it builds really well; unlike some others I've owned, it doesn't look like dried paint when you layer it. It just looks jet black and oh-so-glamourous. I'm in love ladies! 

**Boo**. Onto the Infallible Nail. Well, it was a disappointment but hardly a surprise to me. I have naturally really long nail plates; if I cut them much shorter than [this](http://i.imgur.com/JUPjlwn.jpg) it physically hurts me because I'm cutting into flesh. It's a bit of a curse and a blessing; they grow extremely quickly and everyone always says how lovely they are (perhaps not so much when I have old lady hands, as I do in the pic); but it means I can never get them short enough to a) wear cute funky colours or b) stop them from chipping by just looking at them. So I was pretty excited about reading the blog post; it sounded like an £8.00 Shellac. The blogger is right in that the colours are beautifully shiny and vibrant. But I'm afraid [this](http://i.imgur.com/9TrpI91.jpg) is the state of my nails today, and that's without doing any housework or anything. I'm disappointed. But there seems to be nothing I can do to avoid this problem. I'm sure people with much shorter nails will find the product works for them; I hope so. 

Because I returned the Sleek and it was 3 for 2, I only paid £11.99 extra for those three products yesterday, so that was nice. 

Finally, the **pièce de résistance**, GUSH. My date last night bought me the Naked3!! Which I've only been lusting after for ten months (yes, there will be a second date - d'oh). Oh my goodness it's pretty. It's oh so pretty. I can't stop looking at it and touching it. However, I had already bought Makeup Revolution's [Iconic 3](http://www.makeuprevolutionstore.com/index.php/eyes/palettes/redemption-palette-iconic-3.html) which is an excellent dupe, in my opinion. [Here's](http://imgur.com/UzxV7Lu) a colour comparison. Only the gold is noticeably different. So now that I have the real thing, I no longer need the Iconic 3. **Please message me if you'd like to take it off my hands.** You'll have to sanitise it yourself as I don't have the kit; but if it helps reassure you any, I haven't had an eye infection for six years. Don't worry about paying for it/postage etc - I got something pretty for free and so I'm happy to pass on pretty to someone else :)

He's chosen Earth as his adopted home, a race of primitive apes that haven't even mastered space-travel and who's impact in the galaxy is minimal, so nearly every week we see him rescue either, Earth, or the universe or some ship.  

*So again Second Doctor is forced to regenerate for helping humans, third Doctor dies saving 2 planets both with Humans on them. 4th Doctor killed saving Earth from the Master (and the universe), 5th doctor dies, saving Peri from poisoning, 6th Doctor dies (doing bugger all, actor was sacked), 7th Doctor gunned down in New York, 8th Doctor dies trying to save an ungrateful human, in a war he's refused to be part of (Not many Daleks refuse to go to War), 9th dies saving Earth from Emporer Dalek, and saving Rose his Human companion.  10th dies saving Earth from Time Lords, 11th dies saving some boring planet on edge of nowhere.  

*It's like if you won the euro-millions lottery and instead of spending it on yourself gave every penny to charity, then saved a bus full of orphans, then ended up in hospital for going in to save burning kittens from an orphanage and then after all of that, your spouse decided to divorce you because, you were tempted to not go in to work today.",0,1414251272,null,0,false,0,cljetlj,t3_2k948e,t1_cljetlj,t1_clj8rvk,null,1426357020,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I did have to pay about £12 in customs though but at least they sort it out for you, so you don't get any surprised when it arrives.  I got HD Powder and two Kat von D everlasting lipsticks. HD powder is amazing, really does smooth everything out and you do only need a small amount. The lipsticks are really good too, easily one of the best liquid-matte formulas I've ever tried, and there's a wide range of shades, I got Bauhau5 and LUV and they're beautiful purples. I also picked up some Sephora eye makeup remover as I was short and it's a great product if you need to bump your total up to qualify for the £3 shipping over £50 spend, shipping under £50 was quite costly and I figured it made sense to pick another product rather than just spend that money on delivery. They also sent me a few freebies - a mini Stila stay all day lipstick, a Shiseido moisturiser sample and a Too Faced powder sample. I've honestly fallen in love with Sephora, it's a shame they don't have a base over here. They seem to be super generous with the freebies and offers and they have a lot of codes for even more freebies and they seem to be like the overly generous Selfridges of the make-up world. 

I've also picked up five new MAC lipsticks this week - Styled in Sepia, Fashion Revival, Pander Me and Nouvelle Vogue from the Matte collection, love every single of them. I love the colours, love the formula, non-drying but still matte, I live for MAC's matte lipsticks so when they came out I couldn't resist.

Uhh plenty of academic studies into child abuse plus plenty of professionals with careers of dealing with children who have been groomed and manipulated?

The fact being gay was illegal wasn't to do with the fact society thought them incapable of making rational, adult judgements (which is why it's banned for under 16s) it was because society at the time thought it to be a depraved act of debauchery (akin to having sex with an animal is seen as such today). 

I don't agree that two men having sex is debauchery, but comparing the two laws is fucking dumb.

If he has a mortgage, see if his lender knows it's a let and not his own home?

Checking in the land registry may cost a small fee, but you may have noticed post to your address for him from a bank/lender?

Any gas appliances? If so, were they inspected annually?

If the house meets the criteria for an HMO (sounds like it doesn't, but worth thinking about), is it appropriately registered as such?

You could talk to Shelter (or check their website) to see if it counts as an illegal eviction (which is the main issue here and a pretty big no-no).

I think he did much better with the two up front at the end of this game, but he still did some dumb stuff and failed to score on what looked like a golden opportunity at the end there.

Men don't take anywhere near as much parental leave, so employers will look favorably upon men *in this regard*. 

The solution, as I've always held, is to make sure that maternity and paternity leave is comprehensive, fully compensated by the state (the cost of parental leave should be spread across everyone, not just one employer), **shared across both sexes equally**, and mandatory.

Once parental leave is a equal career burden across both sexes, you'll see both sexes perform more equitably in the workplace. The idea that women are ticking time bombs will die. ",0,1414252668,null,0,false,0,cljfdsg,t3_2k2v8v,t1_cljfdsg,t1_cljbuqn,null,1426356760,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

   1)Looked solid at the back: Yes Hull didn't attack much but we dealt with counter attacks well and Mignolet was solid when relied on, got a clean sheet, good!
  
   2) The attacking was good. Brendan took a risk with the starting 11, it is what managers do, unfortunately it didn't work out so he made some changes, and they were brilliant. After the changes our attacks got better and better. If we had our first choice striker on the pitch we would have won by 3 or 4. Form is slowly coming back, just need a hint of luck.

 **TLDR** Calm your tits, we drew but we are improving, in 5 or 6 games time we will be up there, don't you lot worry.

As I've said, I **want** to like Balotelli, but the lack of communication with any team-mate is making me want to rip out my own eye-balls. Everytime someone tries to feed him or set him up there's just an incredulous glance that he shoots across to them as if to say ""why wasn't that bouncing in front of me so I could flick it up and scissor kick it into the top corner?"" Speaking of which, near enough every touch, Mario seems to want to flick it up and do just that. Which just causes complete and utter fucking frustration.

Coutinho should have started. I've said it so many times since 3pm, but it's true. He was our most effective player by a country mile today when he came on in terms of work rate, ingenuity and general efficiency. Those corners need some work though. 

I don't know what Joe Allen offers at the moment. He's supposed to be the catalyst that links up the play, but all I saw today was him dribbling towards Hull clumsily and being dispossessed.

Week in, week out we put up Balo on his own and he doesn't play well. the moment we go to a diamond with Coutinho in the middle, we look so threatening that we might as well be a completely different team. We do this after 60 minutes. 60 minutes is not a full game. 60 minutes of nothing followed by thirty minutes of something is NOT going to win you the premier league. We knew that last season when we blew away our opponents in the first 20 minutes, then blew the league against Cardiff. It is so absolutely frustrating to watch the first 60 minutes, and then see what we are TRULY CAPABLE OF in the last 30 minutes. It boggles my god damned mind to no end to see this bullshit happen every week and I want to strangle or hit someone, because there IS SOMETHING HERE. We almost won the league last year, and now we're going to be lucky as all hell to finish in any European spot, whether its 5th or 6th if someone manages to win the CL. 






Specifically to the game, Allen brings nothing going forward, as well as Can. Normally Allen is great for possession, but this week he was wasteful, and I don't know if he should really be a regular starter. Manquillo is not the man for the job right now. I don't know what it is, but when i see Manquillo, his man is either waltzing past him and Gerrard is having to put in a two footed crunch in the box to cover him, or hes sprinting from the halfway line to stand there while a cross goes over his face. I see potential for him I do, but Glen was solid enough in the midweek and he's been playing better than Manquillo played today.


I don't think we deserved to win this, and we didn't. We should have won it but that's because our manager refuses to make subs at the half or earlier. 60 minutes without any real efforts at attacking against a bottom half PL side is abysmal and shouldn't be seen as anything other than shocking. Something needs to change, but i doubt it will anytime soon.

&gt;The __Public Broadcasting Service__ (__PBS__) is an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television) [television network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_network). The [non-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization) [public broadcaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting) has 354 member [television stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station), which share [collective ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership).  The network's headquarters is located in [Arlington, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia).

&gt;PBS is the most prominent provider of [television programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program) to public television stations in the United States, distributing series such as *[NOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(TV_series\))*, *[Sesame Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street)*, *[PBS NewsHour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_NewsHour)*, *[Masterpiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_(TV_series\))*, *[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(TV_series\)), [American Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Masters),* *[Frontline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontline_(U.S._TV_series\))*, and *[Antiques Roadshow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiques_Roadshow_(U.S.\))*. Since the mid-2000s, [Roper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GfK) polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as America's most-trusted national institution.  However, PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public TV stations; in fact, stations usually receive a large portion of their content (including most [pledge drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_drive) specials) from [third-party sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_sources), such as [WGBH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGBH-TV), [American Public Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Public_Television), [WETA-TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WETA-TV), [WNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNET), [WTTW National Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTW) and independent producers. This distinction is a frequent source of viewer confusion. 

&gt;PBS also has a [subsidiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary) called [National Datacast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Datacast) (NDI), which offers [datacasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datacasting) services via member stations; this helps PBS and its member stations earn extra [revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue).

It was also some of the worst play I've seen us try and string together in a while to be honest. Very frustrating, and I think if we had made the subs at half-time we'd have won 3-2 or 4-2.

The West Ham crowd were chanting at us ""That was embarrassing"" at points along with ""You're just a shit Man United"" and ""You're fucking useless"", and I have to admit that for long periods of the game I sensed that they might have been right.

The stewards also had to wrestle the ball back off them twice. Do West Ham only own one football?

Oh, and for what it's worth, Chelsea are now 1.45 on Betfair to win the title and that actually looks like value. It would require us to be a substantially improved team compared to today for the remaining 29 games AND for Chelsea to worsen for us to claw back the gap against a Chelsea that look almost unstoppable.

I'm gonna be a dick and recommend you steer clear of J&amp;S. They've really gone downhill, it's all own brand with a HUGE markup or RRP on name brands (which you've seen).

Helmet City are a fantastic vendor. Cheap. They're up near Biggin Hill airport if you can get there.

For jackets etc, try them on in a retail shop like GetGeared and you'll love the fit of some, hate others. You're not getting anywhere near the proper range at J&amp;S any more.

I actually think your original budget was sensible:

* Helmet - budget about £125-£200
* Jacket - budget about £100 for a first one
* Trousers - budget about £100 for a first one
* Gloves - budget about £75 for a first pair

GetGeared in Leatherhead will sort you for the rest. They have an actual range of actual brands and aren't fobbing you off on price.

I got my Schuberth C3 Pro from them at a -significant- discount. Markup on bike gear is near 50% so haggling is permissible if you've seen it cheaper elsewhere.

Halfway through the episode Eccleston regenerates into McGann (I count the War Doctor as an evolution, NOT a regeneration), and he stays until episode twelve when a definitive blow is struck against the Time Lords that forces him to rush through his changes until he's back to being Capaldi.

Milanic was saying that he noticed problems emerging a few minutes before half time and tried to preemptively fix it.

false,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"On the car journey home, I was planning to make a topic discussing how abject Milanic has been - especially today - and how he wasn't the man to lead us forward, but I never expected to arrive home and find out that he'd been sacked. I don't think he saw it coming either. And despite him literally being the worst manager we've ever had (yes, even worse than the Hock: he's the only manager to have never won a game in his time at Leeds), I feel sorry for him.

He was promised time, this season would be about consolidation and next would be about promotion. He left a stable job under little pressure at Sturm Graz to join a club that would sack him after only a handful of games in charge. No wonder he didn't want to move his family from Austria, that was one of the few smart decisions made by Darko when he moved to Leeds! I genuinely thought that he would at least have the Cardiff game (which, naturally, is a dead loss even if we had our best ever side lining up for us) or the Charlton home tie at a stretch.

This is probably a good thing, we were only going backwards under Milanic and unlikely to win any of the upcoming games, but it sets a dangerous precedent that the manager will be sacked after a few unsatisfactory results. I have faith in Redfearn to turn it around (I just hope Milanic hasn't done too much damage to the team) but I still can't help feeling sorry on a personal level for our now former head coach and I remain concerned about Cellino's poor selection of head coaches and itchy trigger finger.",0,1414262028,null,0,false,0,cljjcw6,t3_2kasm0,t1_cljjcw6,t3_2kasm0,null,1426354904,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

I pointed out to him that if a '12 hour lipstick' was disappearing after 30 minutes, I considered that product to be faulty. He got his manager. When I told her the product was faulty and pointed to my lipstick, she said 'what lipstick, it doesn't look as though you are wearing any?' Refund.

The second was a mini They're Real. I went to a pharmacy counter and told the young kid I wanted to return it as it was awful. He just put it through and then had to ask why for the return slip. 'It's the worst mascara I have ever used in 20 years.' Refund. I was determined with this one as it was £14 for a half sized mascara.

Last week was similar. I went to an empty till and grabbed the customer service lady who didn't bat an eyelid, I didn't even have a receipt for this one, but as I was exchanging it for more stuff and clearly was buying a new and different mascara, she didn't bat an eyelid except to ask 'you did buy it in this store?'.

One doesn't have a website or any reviews, and it happens to be the furthest one so I'll omit that one. The second one only has a single review on Yelp, but it's positive. The one I went to today had 10 google reviews, but they're very mixed; seems like it's pretty hit or miss, and their score averages out at 3.7/5. As for price, on the new bikes, they're the same, though there might be a difference in delivery and OTR charges. I'll take a look at used bike prices for comparison, but overall, price wise it seemed pretty reasonable. In regards to Lexmoto quality, I only plan to keep this bike until I turn 24 and do my DAS, so 12-18 months, so as long as it's safe, in good condition, and can last until I get a full licence, it's okay. The alternatives are the CBF, CBR, and YZF. I'm not greatly fond of the CBF, the YZF is far too expensive for something I'm going to be learning on and will probably drop, so that leaves the CBR. It is an option, but a used one is almost double the price of a new Lex, while the Lex is essentially a clone of it.

When a CB pairing is broken suddenly, it leads to more calamity than nearly any other part of the pitch. Therefore you need to prepare beforehand. 


United actually tried this with Evans but failed because it was too late, Liverpool didn't try and are facing this problem and for all of Arsenal fans overrating their absolute gobshite CB pairing they failed in this too big time too.

It's not abundantly clear what kind of player Mourinho would want but they'd have to be at least somewhat defensive-minded so either a box-to-box player or another defensive midfielder. Ramires is an adequate solution but he could be improved upon with someone more creative. Khedira could fit and he seems to be the most mooted solution but there are others. Other than that another dedicated fullback could be helpful since 3 players for 2 positions isn't great (Ake can play LB but seems to be preferred at DM) and a new young CB would be great.,0,1414267404,null,0,false,0,cljllw6,t3_2kayk4,t1_cljllw6,t3_2kayk4,null,1426353783,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

false,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"It has a lot to do with how much you values a human life. The figure of £1m is often quoted, because that is roughly what it costs to deal with an accidental death.

If a public project or development is going to save x amount of cash but cost y lives, £1m per death is regarded as the break even point.

But in this case it is the haulage companies who are going to be £15m better off, and I don't think that is worth 15 lives. Perhaps if it is likely that 2 extra people will die, it is worth doing (everything carries a risk).

Lorries doing around 40mph (+/-10%) already cause 18 deaths a year. If you believe that raising the speed to 50mph will only cause 2 extra deaths, then fair enough. Personally I find that very hard to believe, a lorry doing 50 is far more dangerous than a lorry doing 40.

In terms of dangerous overtaking, the sort of person who will overtake a lorry on a blind bend is the sort of person who probably wants to do 80. Making the lorry go slightly faster isn't going to make the slightest difference to the speed freaks, it will just take them slightly longer to overtake.",0,1414267425,null,0,false,0,cljlm74,t3_2k9rxi,t1_cljlm74,t1_cljaox1,null,1426353779,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,Arel_Mor,null,null,"*Neo-liberal is a weird label to attach to the Economist. Their liberal and have been for 100+ years. Nothing neo about it.*

The Economist was founded by hat manufacturer James Wilson to oppose the Corn Laws, and its commitment to corporations. Despite some grumblings about moral hazard, it applauded the bank bailouts. 

*“This is a time to put dogma and politics to one side and concentrate on pragmatic answers. That means more government intervention in the short term than taxpayers, politicians or indeed free-market newspapers would normally like.”* They love capitalism until shit hits the fan. Then they beg, they BEG, for governement intervention.

The Economist clearly articulated what caused the 2008 crisis had great difficulty in explaining what caused the crisis. *“The people running the system,”* it concluded after the Northern Rock bank failure in 2007, *“not the system itself, are to blame.”*

The Economist basically they said ""*don't hate the player, hate the game*""

That's such a tired false dichotomy. ""The game"" is nothing more than a set of players.  There is no person involved with ""the game"" who isn't a player in it. So to hate ""the game"" IS to hate the players.

* “Capitalism is the best economic system man has invented yet,” it declared in October 2008. 

* *“But in the longer term a lot depends on how blame for this catastrophe is allocated. This is where an important intellectual battle could and should be won.”* they said.

Its mission was to defend the system and its pre-crisis trajectory: lower tariffs, more privatisation, further public sector downsizing. By January this year, even financial deregulation was back on the agenda, the front cover evoking the London Blitz with the headline “Save the City”.

The most serious personality change has been in foreign affairs. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, The Economist backed the British empire as a, I quote, *""wise investment""*, but was rarely jingoistic. Imperialists were attacked as unscrupulous spendthrifts. Between 1919 and 1939 it argued for strengthening the League of Nations with the participation of Germany, Russia and the US. This changed post-war.

They Economist have backed the US in every single major conflict since Vietnam, including the Gulf war, the Balkans war and the invasions of Afghanistan and the 5 attacks on Iraq. It welcomed Obama’s troop surge in Afghanistan and his reliance on drone attacks in Pakistan. On North Korea and Iran, it favours the administration’s hard liners.

More disquieting was its portrait of Dictator Ben Ali who “met peaceful crowds with concessions” — not made until 234 were dead and 510 wounded and hundreds of women raped.

But the best indication of its sync with US Diplomacy is its recent reaction to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. Given a classically liberal cause — freedom of information — it still wrote that the US has a right to punish those who steal and release its secrets, whether or not they are “digital Jacobins” with a “cult following”.

The other used one and the brand new one were both pretty clean, though I asked about a dent in the tank on the new one and he said that it fell a couple of days ago when we had really strong winds, and that they would fix it. 

They had the bikes on a forecourt, but I don't know where they'd be stored overnight, so I will keep an eye out for corrosion if/when I go back. Which leads me nicely onto...

Are the chinese bikes really that bad? I keep hearing that they're shitty, but never any reasons why other than the implied chinese = poor quality. Surely if they were horrendous, the market would have become unviable for them, or is it being fueled by people like me who don't know better? 

But, I am reconsidering now. The same dealership I went to today had a CBR125 for 1900, though with 10k on the clock, but every other CBR125 I can find for sale from a dealership is upwards of 2400. I'll have to wait maybe another month to be in a better financial position; still need to pay for insurance and I'm looking to spend around £400-£600 on gear too. 

On the other hand, if I'm going to wait even more to be able to afford a real bike, then another option becomes viable. I could just wait another six (painfully long) months and go for the A2 license. A bigger bike would make motorway riding feasible, and it's not really critical that I get my full A license immediately after turning 24. 

So what it comes down to is patience: I could have a bike this time next week, or I wait six months, get a better bike on a proper license rather than a CBT.

Navas is the product of loads of turnovers. A bad cross is directly his fault. 

He also doesn't create chances. My main fault with him is that he rarely takes shots or beats players. His speed gets us up the pitch, but remember he's usually crossing toward Aguero and Dzeko which is one aerial threat. He doesn't take corners or free kicks. 

He works less than Milner and Zabaleta, our two best players on the right. He's worse defensively than both of them.

If he doesn't contribute to bringing the ball in the box by shooting or beating players and just wastes crosses (like he did today) then he serves no purpose on the pitch. 

Zabaleta can get forward, create width,  and often scores or takes difficult shots to save. Milner passes instead of crosses, contributes to the defense, and is stronger. Nasri -when fit- beats defenders with ease and sees passes second to only Silva. He also scores. 


This all begs the question, what does Navas really add? I thought he would be dynamic, a Pedro or Robben type that cuts forward on occasion and takes shots, or links with the striker. Instead he goes down the pitch and crosses with (this season) an abysmal  rate. 

His positioning also doesn't fit the system. He stays exclusively wide while  Silva floats in. On other clubs, you'll see the player in Navas position rotate to the other side, or cut in and force a guy like Silva outside. The result makes the attack more unpredictable when creating chances and doesn't allow defenders to predict a pass like they can with Navas. 


That's why I give him hate. /rant

He came back to win the ball, and given that other offensive players were doing similar I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Brendan Rodgers wanted players coming back more to help out defensively.

I think calling him ""poor"" in front of goal is a stretch - he offers many a threat and his big body makes him powerful within 18 yards. Just because he (somehow) hasn't found the net yet doesn't make him poor, perhaps not on top form but also just plain unlucky.

As for my own post, I'll defend a player when I see that it's warranted. Balo has been scapegoat of the entire team's less than stellar run so far this season and I think there's a lot more to it than one striker. He has been in position more often than not as of late, and from watching him week after week I've seen big improvements in his attitude, positioning and effort.

After this episode - I'm tempted not to watch Doctor Who again. In my opinion - the production team should be ashamed of themselves.  If this had been the series to relaunch the show - I doubt it would have been commissioned for a second series. The writing is awful, clonky dialogue, non-sensical plots, rushed pacing, rushed and ludicrous endings.  I can only go so far in suspending my disbelief - all  the houses suddenly dissapearing and forgetting about the trees - really?! All the plots are far to hyperbolic with world-threatening events each episode and not enough time to explore them properly. Either the episodes need to be longer, two parters brought back or smaller scale ideas used. I could go on about the long list of problems that I had with this episode, and the season in general.

Consistently through this series, I have been disappointed by the quality of the episodes and angry that things have declined so much. Doctor Who was my favorite show - one I eagerly anticipated the return of year on year, but if this is going to be the quality of the show from now onwards then I can't stick with it. Episodes considered some of the weakest in previous seasons- ""Curse of the Black Spot"" , ""Fear Her"" or ""Victory of the Daleks"" now seem to be the standard quality of episodes. 

I don't know where it's gone so wrong or whose to blame - but some serious work needs to be done to fix the show back to the standard that it was before. I said at the beginning of my rant, that I was tempted not to watch Doctor Who again. Of course I will, I've loved the show for a long time and don't want to give up on it. But this season has pushed me to a point where I might.

Wat. In fact, I'm pretty sure this was a script from Sarah Jane Adventures, that got rejected because of how shit it was, then Moffat found it and thought ""ooh we need a filler episode this'll do! I'll find someone to change the names for me and throw the tardis in there somewhere and that'll be enough!"".

Clara and the Doctor were waaaay out of character. Doctor goes ""nah i give up k have fun burning"". That would be acceptable if he'd done that earlier in this season. Quit whilst behind would be interesting and further push the ""I don't know you anymore/Am I a good man?"" plot they seemingly have got bored of until the finale I imagine.  Clara comes across as a horrible teacher who gives no shits about her students. They want their parents? Fuck that I want to see a solar flare which might kill the entire planet.

Humour fell flat and child actors were poor, which was a terrible mix. LOL TARDIS SELFIE OMG YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY WATCH OUT FOR NUTS OMG SHES GONNA DIE OMG YOU GUYS LOVE EACHOTHER.

Plot was literally ""oh shit trees. Oh shit solar flare. Oh the trees saved the day. K"". The ""turns out doing nothing was the solution"" should be used very sparingly, not twice a season. There was no conflict until the last five minutes. 40 minutes of confusion and establishing ""trees in london ain't right yo"" isn't entertaining.

Where were all the other people in London? What does the doctor mean they'll all just forget? Have all alien attacks been forgotten? How does the sonic screwdriver not work on wood if all wood is aliens? Why did none of the other kids parents come looking for them? Why did the magic tulips kidnap a teenage girl? Why did the doctor so easily try to bail? Why did the trees need to possess a random little girl? Why that girl in particular? Why did only the mystical algae burn and not all the plant life on the planet? Has anyone noticed there's a tiger possibly loose in the London Underground? Why why why?

I am unreasonably annoyed with how bad that was. Moffat can't showrun. He just can't. He's a terrific writer, he wrote ""Girl in the Fireplace"" for God's sake. But he just can't help himself. Without a funnel for his best ideas to go through, he just word vomits and sticks to it. He just doesn't have the restraint to have a consistent universe, but why does he need a consistent universe? The doctor can just change it lol. Even insignificant things like the intro he has to just KEEP. ON. CHANGING.

Bottom line for me is; you can't just evict a tenant or stop them entering their home. Unless there is a breach of the peace, no one is getting nicked and the whole mess needs to be sorted through the civil courts.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Chelsea play a 4-2-3-1 though and Oscar is in the band of 3. I think the players you're naming play a role in the team more similar to fabregas' than Oscar's. Oscar is a unique player, a number 10 who can dribble and is very good at finishing and shooting. His vision is very good too as he shows for brazil and at time for Chelsea. And his pressing and tackling are both world class, whole grow into a world class complete midfielder for Chelsea. It's his play that allows fabregas to play in the pivot. 

I like pjanic a lot but I struggle to see how he would force Oscar out the team. He doesn't have the pace and attacking instincts of a CAM. He'd be competing with fabregas, not Oscar. I also don't think he's a better player than Oscar. Same goes for Pogba, a lot here are intrigued with him but I don't see how he'd improve the team. He'll likely develop into a very very good player but right now I'd take Oscar. The seria a is a very different beast to the epl. If this Chelsea squad were in the seria a they would dominate.

Moutinho and Marchisio are more established players. I'm not sure if any of them are better than Oscar right now but they're certainly class. They have 5 years on Oscar though and I think Oscar will easily be better when he's in his prime.

Oscar is a gem of a player and I don't know if he get's enough love here. He's playing well this season and bar the second half of last season he's been consistently class for Chelsea. He's been a constant starter for Chelsea since he got here at 20/21 and is undroppable for Brazil. Fifa is absolutely not a good way to judge players but I reluctantly mention that he does have the highest rating of the group in fifa.

Ramires is also used for 4-3-3 but as I said I think a box-to-box midfielder with a defensive leaning or a more productive defensive mid would be a better choice.

&gt;The __Tunguska event__ was a large [explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosion) which occurred near the [Podkamennaya Tunguska River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podkamennaya_Tunguska_River) in what is now [Krasnoyarsk Krai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnoyarsk_Krai), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), at about 07:14 [KRAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnoyarsk_Time) (00:14 [UT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time)) on June 30 [O.S. June 17], 1908.    The explosion occurred at an altitude of 5–10 kilometres (3–6 mi) at 60.886°N, 101.894°E. It is classified as an [impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event) even though the asteroid or comet is believed to have burst in the air rather than hit the surface.  Different studies have yielded widely varying estimates of the impacting object's size, on the order of 60 m (200 ft) to 190 m (620 ft).  It is the largest impact event on or near Earth in [recorded history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history).

&gt;Since the 1908 event, there have been an estimated 1,000 scholarly papers (mainly in Russian) published on the Tunguska explosion. Many scientists have participated in Tunguska studies: the best known are [Leonid Kulik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kulik), [Yevgeny Krinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Krinov), [Kirill Florensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirill_Florensky), Nikolai Vladimirovich Vasiliev, and Wilhelm Fast.  In 2013, a team of researchers led by Victor Kvasnytsya of the [National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_Ukraine) published analysis results of micro-samples from a peat bog near the blast epicenter showing fragments that may be of meteoric origin.

false,grollcool,null,null,"I agree with much of what you said but a few things I wanted to say.

Oscar still has a lot of improvement to do in a lot of areas. Two things I disagree with you on is that he is his shooting and vision. His play making ability leaves *a lot* to be desired about. Although he scores the occasion good shot, he skies a lot of balls. If you look at his shot conversion you would be probably not be impressed. He has the ability but he is nowhere near consistent enough with it for me to call him a world class shooter yet.

His vision and playmaking as well. He comes nowhere near Mata and Fabregas when it comes to picking out balls for forwards and other attackers. Too many times he would pick up the ball in good advanced positions but not be able to find that killer thread in through ball. This was really evident last season when he only finished with 2 assists, which is pretty bad for any midfielder let alone someone in the number 10 role. For comparison, Matic, a defensive midfielder who came in half way through the season and takes no set pieces finished with 4.

Oscar is certainly a unique player but he is not a proper number 10 and I don't think he should be played there. I believe Mourinho has got it spot on moving him into a central midfield, box-to-box role. His best attributes is his tenacious hustling he has across the pitch and the pressure he can put on opposition players without the ball. The rest is good but still needs to be worked on. If he becomes a more clinical shooter and has some of Fabregas' playmaking ability rub off on him he can become one of the top central midfielder in the world. He still has a lot of work left though.

Ninja edit: On Pogba, the reason most people he believe he is better than Oscar is because his shooting ability is among the best in the world and he is also a great dribbler. I wouldn't say that Oscar is a better playmaker than him either because Pogba can set others up as well. Combine that all with his amazing physicality and strength and you have a mini-yaya toure. Really defending is Pogba's only weak spot (which surprises people), he is brilliant going forward. That is why they (France and Juve) never play him as a holding midfielder, always box-to-box.",0,1414272286,null,0,false,0,cljnnh0,t3_2kayk4,t1_cljnnh0,t1_cljn9fc,null,1426352831,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3
false,TLKv3,null,null,"The plot would have been better served if the idea of the trees sprouting everywhere was a new species who were the original inhabitants of the Earth who can connect consciousnesses to it. The species realizes the Sun is about to create a one-off supernova/solar flare that could wipe out all life (including themselves) and takes the ""lost"" sister with a wild imagination to connect to the Earth to think of a way to protect it. Thus the girl thinks up a gigantic, fireproof, ray proof forest as a deflective shield. However the sister doesn't have enough strength to keep the forest shield up. Maebh could've then felt that sisterly connection and finds the sister, and with her provides her the strength to protect the Earth. The Doctor then accepts that maybe children CAN be of extraordinary value and unique. Unlike what he's been saying about them all series long.

I would've felt far more connected to the story than what it ended up being. Just a bunch of absolutely absurd plot ideas twisted into a train wreck. I didn't even really understand what the Hell was happening 95% of the time. The threat was a solar flare apparently and the trees sprouted up. There was fireflies or something that said... stuff? Was that of any consequences at all? Did that part even matter? Especially the ""phone the world"" bit. That was actually kind of annoying as shit. Who the fuck would even listen to that? Governments are going to get a call from a little girl and just say ""welp, she said not to, ok then!"" And the missing sister just being hidden in a brush? For fuck sakes.

Also the part with Missy. What was she surprised about? The fact that Humans let the forest stay up to protect the planet? Did she WANT the planet to die?

In actual fact, the episode was dull with no sense of fear or peril. The child acting was bad ""OMG YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO NUTS""""SHE'S DEAAAAD!!!"". Clara is unlikable as ever (Although the next episode seems like it could rectify that). Danny was pointless and the tiger and wolves were even more useless. Why couldn't the TARDIS detect and incoming solar flair? Why did Clara completely forget that time could be rewritten? Put simply, what was the point of this episode?

false,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"Long story short?

You get some bassists whose sole contribution to the band's sound is to play a chord's root note (the deepest note in a chord) in rhythm with the drums, purely as accompaniment. For instance, in [this video here of Oasis playing Don't Look Back In Anger in 1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUzhdruhqIo), where Noel plays a G cord, all the bassist plays is the G note an octave below the lowest one Noel's guitar plays. There's nothing wrong with that style. It fills out the acoustic spectrum nicely, and adds a lot of weight and body to the sound. It's just not very interesting, though.


What makes Jack Bruce special is that he's one of the first, and one of the best, bassists in rock to recognize the bass as an instrument in its own right,  and to play it as something that drove and formed the music, not just something that supported the other instruments. For example, compare the simple, supportive melody in that Oasis song to the melodies and fills Jack plays in this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_aR2hfy_7Y#t=166 . His bass work is a fully composed piece in in its own right. It also fills the acoustic spectrum, but does it in a much more interesting way. 

His legacy is that he, for a lot of people, made the bass an instrument they wanted to play and aspired to master, rather than just the instrument people fell back on because they wanted to be in a band but weren't good enough at 6-string guitar. He's inspired a lot of musicians, and he can be pretty well credited with helping to give better music to all of us. And that's why he's considered one of the musical greats.

Pogba may be a bit overrated because he plays in seria a. He is a good shooter but also skies a ton of shots.

The child actors were AWFUL. Bad dialogue, atrocious acting, annoying personalities... I could go on for months. That ginger kid and Maive or whatever her name was were especially bad.

2. The story
The idea of the world being overrun with trees is a promising an interesting idea, but the way it was executed was awful. I especially hate those DW stories where the characters have no effect on the plot. What should happen in DW: Something bad happens, main characters jump in to save the day, and prevent the coming catastrophe. What happened in this episode: Something bad happened, main characters jumped in to save the day, discovered that the 'bad' thing was actually a good thing, meaning that the world would have been safe even if the main characters did nothing.

3. The set
What happened to the millions of people that live in London? We saw two people that were not actually main characters. Where were the confused pedestrians? Where were the CARS? It was like every car in London had just magically disappeared. What happened to THE CITY? We saw like two buildings hidden behind the trees, but apart from that, not only did trees completely take over the world, but so did soil. How was there suddenly soil covering the planet, where there was none in the first place? What about the Sahara desert? Antarctica? How would the trees have survived there? How would there even be SOIL there?

I understand there isn't as big of an abortion debate over here as there is in the US but there are still people who disagree with it or want the point where you can have an abortion in a pregnancy changed. Maybe I misread the episode but l definitely feel that the writer was trying to convey that the moon was an allegory for an unborn child and that killing it was wrong even though some people wanted to because it was easier.

It's unbelievable the staggering amount of fans in that thread that think they are gonna crush us. Have they been watching at all this season? They've been awful, and we've been more than dominant. I think they are forgetting that our team is more than just Costa, they're forgetting that we almost won the league last year without a striker. Well now that team behind the striker got even better, plus we've added one of the deadliest strikers in the world right now in Costa. Even if Costa doesn't play, our team is more than well equipped to embarrass them.

Our defense is fucking solid (we've been letting in more goals this year than last but we also haven't been making defense a priority, the personnel hasn't changed except for Luis and Courtois, and one could argue that those are improvements).

And our midfield is easily the best in the league. Matic is a fucking rock wall. Fabregas is unbelievable, he can literally pick a spot on the field and put the ball exactly where he wants with ease. We have Eden fucking Hazard, do I even need to say anything about him? Oscar is fantastic and works perfectly with Fabregas. Willian has really improved this year and is looking great, plus he's a fucking horse, he'll give 110% the entire game. Schurrle is a stone cold finisher and has an attacking mind like very few I have ever seen. He's always looking for those runs behind the defense and has an incredible understanding of how the attacking game works. Look at that first goal he scored, he recognized that pass was coming way before Ivanovic even looked for Fabregas.

Even if we don't have Costa or Remy, I'm not worried. Look what we did last year without a striker, now we have Drogba. I know he's not the Drogba we used to have, but I have no doubt that he can still put the ball in the back of the net if he gets a decent chance to shoot.

Well UKIP would cut the immigration numbers massively for a start. This means no masses of uneducated low skilled workers coming in. That would mean that the people already here get education and are raised up to what we would deem the British standard. Education and the higher standard of living that generally accompanies it means people less inclined to rape for cultural reasons.

A lot of the problem in places like Rotherham is that the communities there are isolationist, they wall themselves off from Britain to practice their belief system even if at direct odds to the British ways or ideals. This has been allowed to happen without question under multiculturalism because any criticism has been met with the endless chorus of ""you're racist"".

So you get a bunch of Islamists all hell bent on hurting the west for the wars in the Middle East, taught that white girls are whores. They abuse them and we get the situation we have now.

But I digress. UKIP don't want *more* immigration from Pakistan, they want more immigration proportionally from the Commonwealth instead of the EU. They want a quota system where prospective immigrants need a certain number of points to come into the country. This is based on factors such as education, skillsets, job experience, wealth, language skills etc. The people that would be immigrating into the country would generally be skilled workers, particularly the high end of the skillset who are getting handwaved in no matter the government because money.

The overall rate of immigration under UKIP would be drastically lower. What they would do though is bring in proportionally more people from the former colonies and less proportionally from the EU. Why the EU? Because the EU laws mean that anyone at all has complete freedom of movement within the EU to move where they like. This means *anyone* from Europe can come, even the lower classes from other countries. So our jobs go to them and they ferry a bit of money back home. We are powerless to refuse someone entry unless we know they are a criminal and even then only in serious cases.


Everyone downvotes me in this sub, it's fine. I'm a UKIP supporter in a left wing sub, it's what I ""deserve"". Even the reasonable posts with sources get downvoted or the essay length responses, it doesn't matter. I've stopped trying to toe the line and be extra careful with saying anything too away from the left wing, it's pointless and gets downvoted anyway.

 I don't understand the need to include children in the episode to justify that its a children's show, and not include any of the children who had appeared previously in the season who had decent actors and interesting believable characters. I understand that Doctor Who is considered to be a family show or a kids show but that doesn't justify Frank Cottrell Boyce's boring, plotless, and obviously predictable writing.


This episode had no redeeming qualities that I can think of, and the ""everybody forgets everything except us"" plotline that strangely appears in every bad episode ruins any character development for our characters and makes no sense, I assume that Danny will forget that Clara is still hanging out with the Doctor, and Clara will forget whatever ""power of love and children"" crap she was supposed to learn for some weird reason.

We're not gunna explain why, or give any development to any of the family other than the mum is a bit of a bitch and the younger daughter is slightly crazy, but we'll then have a nice touching reunion that everyone'll love even though they're more emotionally invested in the little round things in the Tardis than they are about her.

I think this is a fair complaint, and one that's too often dismissed

&gt;because any criticism has been met with the endless chorus of ""you're racist"".

as you say. In fairness, UKIP doesn't help its cause by giving candidate status to *actual* racists, even if it was as a result of a lack of proper vetting processes, but I suppose that's besides your point.

&gt;So you get a bunch of Islamists all hell bent on hurting the west for the wars in the Middle East, taught that white girls are whores. They abuse them and we get the situation we have now.

I think these are two separate issues - whenever I've seen Islamists who commit terror attacks here (eg Lee Rigby's murderers) or elsewhere (that guy who was killed in Syria recently), they've always spoken perfect English with an accent corresponding to the part of Britain they were from. And relatively well educated. I think community-isolationism and islamist terrorism are not related issues, though you might bring them under the umbrella of ""multiculturalism"".

&gt;Education and the higher standard of living that generally accompanies it means people less inclined to rape for cultural reasons.

I don't know about rape for cultural reasons... Educated and uneducated, high or low standard of living, people (mostly men) rape because they think they'll get away with it. What is *definitely* unacceptable is letting them get away with it to prevent a race riot, but I see that as an excuse. It's a well-established pattern that the authorities don't care about rape and child abuse.

&gt;But I digress. UKIP don't want more immigration from Pakistan, [...]. They want a quota system where prospective immigrants need a certain number of points to come into the country. [...]

My understanding is of a points-based system without a quota, but I don't really know what UKIP's policy is exactly (and there's a lot of confusion about what UKIP's policies actually are - some of it because UKIP change it at a moment's notice, and some of it due to misreporting in the media). Maybe you have a link to the details of their current policy? I haven't heard of a quota, only points. We have a points-based system now. What policy of UKIP's would have prevented this?

&gt;[...]  Because the EU laws mean that anyone at all has complete freedom of movement within the EU to move where they like. [...]

I can definitely agree with you, that the EU's freedom of movement principle is not compatible with its policy of expansion eastwards. Much like the Euro, it demonstrates an alarming lack of foresight, and it's that lack of foresight which I find the most convincing reason of all to leave (though I remain undecided on how I would vote in the eventual and inevitable referendum).

&gt;Everyone downvotes me in this sub, it's fine. I'm a UKIP supporter in a left wing sub, it's what I ""deserve"".

Don't let the bastards grind you down. I hate it when people downvote because they disagree - though I don't know if that's why people downvote you or not. I often get downvoted on political subs, sometimes because I shitpost and sometimes because people just don't agree with what I say. Hopefully, if you stick around and some other kippers join you, we can achieve more of a balance. To me, there's no long-term interest in joining a subreddit other than one of the party-political ones, with a clear bias. Even if it's a bias in my favour.

Anyway. I think this ad by UKIP was in poor taste. I don't see a tangible link between the Labour party and the child-abuse coverup which I can honestly believe would not apply to any other party. People in power ignore child abuse and then try to cover it up to save their own arses. I sincerely believe UKIP would do the same. Not because I have some sort of agenda against UKIP, but because that's what people do. I find it in terribly poor taste that UKIP would try to use this for party-political point scoring.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"This is a Doctor still in flux. This is a Doctor trying to figure out if he is a Good Man and if he still deserves the name of Doctor. This is a Doctor that is actually more willing to let his companions help to save the day or even save the day on their own. He doesn't want to take everything upon himself like he normally has but doesn't want to fashion his companions into weapons either. He is trying to make up for past mistakes while paving a path forward.

And I would argue against him having done nothing and the show being all about Clara. Yes they have given her more of a voice and an active role sometimes, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. When it comes down to it he is the one saving the day in nearly every episode, he just knows he needs help to do it. In fact the only time he really does nothing is when he doesn't need to do anything.

In Kill the Moon he didn't do ""anything"" because he has to know that Earth can be fine without him. They have to be able to make certain choices without him. This wasn't an advanced alien invasion that would have destroyed the entire Earth without his intervention. This was a potentially innocent life they would have to weigh against their own. The Doctor cannot always be there to save the day. If humanity always expects some man to sweep in and save the day how are they ever going to expand out there into the universe. In truth he essentially did ""everything"" by not doing ""anything"". He also had hoped that by giving Clara the ultimate decision that she would understand him better. He hoped she would feel valued and not feel like a soldier be ordered to do something, or a child with their hand being held. Unfortunately it came off appearing to be just that despite his best intentions.

The point of Listen isn't about doing anything. The whole point of that episode was that it doesn't matter if there is a monster under the bed  because it is okay to be afraid. In fact he ""did"" a lot (he studied, he prepared to meet the thing at the end of the universe if it existed, and if it had and was evil he would have fought it). It just wasn't necessary to do anything. The Doctor doesn't always have to fight monsters because there aren't always monsters to fight. That doesn't mean he still shouldn't worry about monsters, but it means he doesn't have to go looking for them if they possibly aren't there.

That is pretty much the point of In The Forest Of The Night. The Doctor tried to fight the ""monsters"" but there was no monsters. In fact there were others there to save the day. The Doctor isn't the only person or thing in the universe trying to save the day. Sometimes there are people better able and prepared to save the day and that is okay.

The Doctor has had some badass moments (confronting the Half Face Man, setting up the Time Heist, confronting the Mummy himself) just not too many crazy over the top I am practically God speeches or acting like he is everyone's savior like his more recent incarnations. He is trying to make up for his past mistakes and acting like he is above it all and a larger than life champion of the universe, is probably one of those mistakes. 

He takes charge when he feels like he needs to, stays in the background when he feels like he needs to, let's others play up to their strengths when he feels they need to. He tries to analyze situations a bit more although curiosity often still gets the better of him.",0,1414276858,null,0,1414277080,0,cljpk5g,t3_2kbjc7,t1_cljpk5g,t1_cljonyz,null,1426351940,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

false,matcht,lfc12,,"I think Allen, Manquillo and Skrtel are serviceable squad players, maybe Enrique too at a push but his wages are fairly high. Manquillo is solid defensively but poor on the ball. Allen is useful in certain situations, but he'll never be a top midfielder. Skrtel is useful but I can't believe he's first choice.

I think Markovic is a big talent and just needs time. Next season we'll see the best of him. He'll catch flak for it but it's not his fault we decided to sign him now where fans will expect an immediate contribution and transition. We wouldn't have signed him if we got Sanchez.

We paid too much for Lovren and Lallana, though with the latter I can understand it. 

Simply what bugs me is that not much thought seems to go into our signings. The best example of this is Mignolet. He's similar to Reina in that he's a reflex keeper, good 1 vs 1. His weaknesses, like Reina, are in the air and commanding his area. Add in that he's worse with distribution, then you really wonder why we signed him. 

Watching Bravo tonight for Barca, costing £6m, really made me wonder about our scouting team. He's the kind of signing Rafa would have made, none of the signings Rodgers has made have been particularly inspired bar Sturridge and Coutinho.",0,1414276914,null,0,false,0,cljpl12,t3_2kbeky,t1_cljpl12,t1_cljpdkc,null,1426351928,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0
