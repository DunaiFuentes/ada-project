I went ""Who the fuck are these old people?"" And said ""NOPE!""

I since have learned about Classic Who and LOVE THE CRAP OUT OF IT. McGann is my favorite Doctor. I listened to his audios and deemed him better than the new stuff. I also enjoyed and appreciated the others portrayals and now I do not seem them as ""fat old people."" You know, kinda how half of the comments in this thread seem to see them. 

I *still* kick myself for not going to meet them and get autographs. I can't wait until they are back in my general area. I'd be way more excited to see them than I ever could have imagined. Ah, I was so young and stupid to pass up seeing some ""old people."" I learned my lesson. I'd jump at the chance to meet any of them no matter how briefly.

One time I was five or so downvotes deep and somehow some tide turned due to a comment that agreed with me and by the end of the day I had a ton of upvotes.

Furthermore, Moffett made a big deal about touch being required. Not just proximity. And touch has a bigger significance as far as storytelling. And he would know that when the primary timeline /universe is restored,  he would be back where he was - in the tesselecta. 
Additionally,  my idea has credence as we have seen coexisting version of time lines before that can overlap,  like Rory dying in Winter Quay and then dying in jumping,  yes,  it results in a paradox but it shows that all time isn't predestined. Just because the Doctor was eventually in the tesselecta doesn't mean he always was. You are confusing time and time lines. Yes,  cause can be non-linear from effect but I've yet to see the doctor be effected by something he has yet to do that he doesn't end up doing. He has to do it eventually. There effect must have a cause and it must come after in a person's subjective timeline,  but not their objective timeline. You can always ""remember a bucket"" but can't get a bucket without remembering. 

Now,  I'll rewatch *WoRS* but I am pretty sure there is nothing to indicate that he was a robot doc in the alt timeline. Additionally,  if time was dispelled and all that had happened was removed,  so much as him losing his clothes,  and Amy (most)  of her memory,  why would he keep his robot suit. There now is none of his history in (localized) existence.

Neither am I or most people on this sub. Yet most people are interested enough to research players that will fit the Liverpool mould. People that post intelligent, researched comments get upvoted more because they are more interesting and promote more discussion.

&gt; but i know what my team lacks - how else am i supposed to express it?

I guess just learn more about the game and players. 

&gt;Also why not just move onto the next comment, instead of up/down-voting. Why do people feel compelled to click something and then seek a rationale to justify it?

I say this because there are a lot of countries with no welfare at all. And yet damn-it those poor people just don't seem to want to die! Not that living in filth, with a calorific deficit and no education, is a fun life, sure, but unless you send a bunch of guys with rifles through a slum to wipe out the people, they're not all that keen on dying!

No, no, I think the Tories needed a scapegoat. A group of people to be feared and maligned, but all the Tories had to do was use the press to change people's attitude towards the new scapegoat class, from sympathy to hatred. Compassion becomes expense. Something like that.

If you're looking to house-share then there are plenty of opportunities with former Uni of Surrey students or ""young professionals"" around town, usually behind the train station/cathedral area or in the York Road area (which I think is much nicer).  Check the usual places: the [Guildford Gumtree page](http://www.gumtree.com/guildford), [the Surrey newspaper](http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/), etc.  

If you are looking to get a place by yourself then it can be very expensive; the cheapest options are probably the flats above the shops and car-parks in the town centre.  After this, it's in the traditionally ""council estate"" areas of Park Barn and Bellfields (and surrounding areas like Stoughton/Grange Road/Cumberland Avenue).  You'll often hear Guildfordians talking about how rough places like Park Barn are but, really, they are pretty safe.  However, if you want instant access to the train station then they may not be for you anyway.  We have a good bus network (if a tad expensive) but traffic can be *very* slow in Guildford.

Yes, there are a couple of hockey teams for both genders.  Guildford Hockey Club play at Broadwater School, so you might need a car or a lift to get there.  Nice facilities though.  There is also a team that play at Surrey Sports Park, which would be more local - and I'd also recommend checking Spectrum Leisure Centre to see if there are any teams that play up there.

We have a wide selections of gyms, if that's your bag.  Plenty of football and rugby clubs, and between Spectrum and Surrey Sports Park you can find pretty much every other sport that you want.  I think there's even an Australian Football Team that play on Stoke Park.

General life: it's nice, safe and well-located.  There are plenty of decent enough pubs, though the night-life swings between absolutely packed and utterly dead on a seemingly random basis.

The DM so as to appeal to the vast majority of unquestioning feckwits, a cheap popularity stunt. 

&gt;Sir Richard, Regius Professor of History and President of Wolfson College Cambridge, suggested the criticism stemmed from his vocal opposition to the Education Secretary’s ill-fated attempts to reform the way history is taught in schools.

&gt;Professor Evans told The Independent: “I never said that at all. I said his proposals for the National Curriculum were narrow tub-thumping jingoism and there is some relationship between that.” 

That is it, right there. That is exactly what it is about, nothing to do with WWI or how the centenary will be marked, that is a vote-grabbing shroud for Gove. 

&gt;”  In his article Mr Gove claimed that the centenary of the start of the war which is being marked this year should not be seen “through the fictional prism” of Oh! What a Lovely War and Black Adder which characterised the four years of fighting which cost 16m lives and resulted in 20m wounded as a “series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite”. “Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed these myths,” he wrote.

I have read that part 10 times and it still doesn't make much sense to me. It could be that I am being extremely dim (help me out if I am) but it reads oddly. ~~Ok  to paraphrase, Gove is saying that the centenary should not be seen through rose-tinted specs, Blackadder style, but as a "" series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite"". Ok I get that bit I think, I am a little surprised Gove would say it but ok. But then he says ""Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed these myths"". So he is saying that left-wing academics, or in this case Professor Evans would perpetuate the Blackdder rose-tinted view of WWI? Really? Is that really what he is saying? History professors, left wing or otherwise would not perpetuate that view whatsoever, which is why I find myself questions whether I have really read that part right or if Gove really is that stupid to say that.~~

Economic competition had turned into competition for territories, and the outcome depended on armed might. No state could afford to back down once the chain of confrontations had been set off by the Sarajevo assassination, because no state could risk a weakening of its global strength. The same imperialism which had stimulated economic growth and a belief in the inevitability of progress was now to tear the heart of Europe apart.

&gt; There was thus consternation in 1903 when it became known that a company owned by German banks had been entrusted by the Ottoman government with the construction of a gigantic railway line that would extend from the Ankara end of the Anatolian Railway via Adana and Aleppo across Mesopotamia to Baghdad and (ultimately) Basra on the Persian Gulf. The project, which in theory would one day make it possible to travel by train directly from Berlin to Baghdad, met with suspicion and obstruction from the other imperial powers. The British were concerned at the prospect of the Germans acquiring privileged access to the oil fields of Ottoman Iraq, whose importance was growing at a time when the British navy was planning the transition from coal-to oil-fired ships. They feared that the Germans, freed through a land route to the east from the constraints imposed by British global naval dominance, might come to threaten Britain’s pre-eminence in colonial trade. Although the route of the railway had been laid – at great inconvenience to the engineers and investors – as far as possible from Russian areas of interest, St Petersburg still feared that it would place the Germans in a position to pose a threat to Russian control of the Caucasus and northern Persia.

ooooooo you're gonna love this year, 

the human race finally does away with that silly idea that Moore's law has an endpoint. 

According to some physicists at this time and ""string theory"" 

(an idea that, in my personal opinion is a vast oversimplification of the entirety of creation,
 you know I really should pay good old Wereny another visit to correct what he misunderstood from my explanation, though I guess I should cut him some slack given we were running in a forest from angry Nazi officials who had just caught on to his ingenious method of sharing his findings on nuclear power with Einstein, too bad they walked straight into a swarm of Vashta Narada ) 

where was I? Oh yes ""string theory"" says at every singly decision,

 (or any and every possibility of every energy arrangement if you like),

 creates its own universe in which that decision was made, 

for example, if someone were to say come up to a street and turn left, it might create a completely different set of causal events then if they'd turned right.

 Except both options, along with innumerable others were selected,

that is both happened because at that instant, a universe was created in which that person turned left 

AND, 

one was created in which that same person turned right. 

So,

 Clara calling Gallifrey, and Gallifrey responding by giving me enough energy for me to regenerate again,

 created a new universe completely distinct from the one we resided in earlier in our time streams,

 while this again, is an oversimplification it should give an idea as to how the universe can deal with all those ""paradoxes"" I go about making,

 the enormous temporal energy is not in sustaining a logical impossibility so much as keeping us from slipping into the void while transferring into a different causal event matrix.

The point is simply that with 1,000 properties he *will* lose money by taking on people on housing benefits, and there's nothing he can really do to stop that from happening. Regardless of what the lease says when someone doesn't make a payment you don't get any money. And it's not like you can immediately turf them out and replace with a paying tenant either.

With anyone else if they simply don't pay he can still get the money. And why would you, me, him, or anyone else take non-guaranteed income over the exact same amount of guaranteed income given the option between the 2? I know what I'd pick, what he picked, and surely you would too?

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"It depends why house prices were dropping. If it is because of an increase in supply due to more houses being built then that would indicate that there would also be more houses for rent and would reduce rent prices. 

If it is because the removal of cheap credit has meant fewer can afford the houses, then the answer would be that there aren't more houses in total, but potentially more for rent then it could mean a reduction in rent prices. I think the aim of the BoE is to make it so that interest rates going up causes the price rises to reduce, rather than to cause increases in repossessions, so that may not happen. 

If it is because the market is overinflated by a government intervention then the removal of that could reduce demand without increasing supply in the rental market, so it wouldn't reduce prices.

But for smaller scale businesses its harder to make that argument. 

If a small business takes out a loan then part of the interest they're paying is a collective insurance paid by all the banks debtors in case one defaults. If they go bankrupt then the only welfare that is covering them is voluntarily from other debtors who have entered into it.

The housing costs are a function of lack of supply in the locations where people want to live, and of poorly distributed wealth (which allows demand to drive prices up further than it would if fewer could afford the higher rents), not of concentration of ownership of the housing - the housing market is too competitive for the margins to remain excessively high.

Redistribution of wealth would ease it somewhat, but the only thing that would drive the cost down substantially would be to free up more land (for my house the insurance company estimates the cost to rebuild from scratch to 50% of the total value, in other words they value the land at 50%, meaning you have an absolute price floor of 50% of current prices in my area unless you increase density or allow building on more land, or drive down demand), build more, and to find ways of driving the cost of building more property down.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Read the article very carefully. On first reading, it sounds like he's kicking out all his tenants who are on benefits - but if you read between the lines, it doesn't say that at all.

What it does say is:

 - He's not taking on any more tenants with benefits. They're far more likely to default and you can't get insurance against that risk - which you can if they're employed.
 - He has sent eviction notices to 200 tenants. It doesn't say anything about whether or not they represent 100% of the ""tenants who are on benefits"" this chap has. 


The only way I can interpret this article so it makes any sense is that this chap's position is as follows:

 - He's evicting his 200 worst tenants because they're frequently in arrears. Who in their right mind would evict someone with a history of paying their rent on time every month just because they're on benefits?
 - He won't be accepting people on benefits as new tenants because of the 200 he's evicting, most if not all of them are on housing benefit. 
 - He says **""With tenants on benefits the number of defaulters outnumbers the ones who pay on time""** - to my way of thinking, that suggests that he could have anything from 201 to 399 tenants on benefit. 
   - I speculate the number is probably closer to 399 because most people would probably have worded that sentence rather more strongly if 99% of people on benefits were defaulting.",0,1388838615,null,0,false,0,ceh2r2n,t3_1udrhq,t1_ceh2r2n,t1_ceh24bk,null,1431794519,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

Yes Britain felt their interests were threatened by Germany but only because Germany had been systematically building up its army and navy for the past 20 years. This definitely made us nervous seen in how we suddenly started garrisoning a lot more battleships in Britain as the German announced their naval plan. Furthermore Germany acted aggressively in the global stage the seen in the Morroco crises. If Britain was so war hungry why did it not use these events to start a war? Why did it play a large part in keeping the peace? Thus German expansionism and agression played a huge role in starting WWI, especially as they were the ones that declared war on Russia and France and then violated Belgian neutrality (which we were bound to uphold).

In the build up to war we were very reluctant to get involved. Over half the cabinet opposed going to war to start with and France was panicking that we'd abandon them. We were in a position under which our politicians felt obliged to go to war, even though they did not necessarily want it.

So why did we the invade Basra? Ok firstly Britain had lot of troops stationed in India, a mixture of Brits and local recruits, thus it was not difficult to deploy to Iraq. Why deploy here? Well Ottoman Turkey (that controlled the area at the time) had sided with Germany so attacking it made sense. Considering it was also very weak compared to the other nations attacking it was tempting. Furthermore a lot of our oil came from Persia which shared a border with the Ottomans. Thus occupying key areas of Iraq would prevent a potential attack on the oilfields and refineries key to our war effort (however don't take this to mean the war was about oil, merely that once at war protecting oil supplies was very important).

No state could afford to back down once the chain of confrontations had been set off by the Sarajevo assassination, because no state could risk a weakening of its global strength.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"Yes, and I'm fully in favour of aggressively using powers like that. But large buy-to-let landlords are amongst the least likely owners to leave properties empty.

Most of them are heavily leveraged, maximizing mortgages to get as many properties as possible and using the rents to cover interest - the real long-term money in buy-to-let is in long term capital appreciation, as if you manage to leverage to 90%, for example, and cover the costs with rents, then every 1% increase in property values translate to a 10% return on your original cash.

But being highly leveraged also means you can't afford to leave properties empty - a highly leveraged landlord that feels to keep occupancy levels high will quickly end up with a domino chain of repossessions.

In terms of property *utilization*, buy-to-let landlords are thus rarely the problem. One might have plenty of objections to them from other points of view, such as (as exemplified by the article) the power it puts into private hands to severely affect those who are already in need of help.

Actually they don't. They go up by what the market will bear. My mortgage interest rate increased last year, like it did for a lot of landlords, but the rent didn't go up because the local rental market didn't go up so to increase mine by the rise in the mortgage would make me uncompetitive.

If I bought a house to rent out for £150,000 5 years ago, the fact that houses are now say £140,000 doesn't alter the fact I've still got a mortgage for £150,000. My mortgage payments don't get less as I owe less, just that more of them goes to repay the capital rather than the interest.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"It's an incredibly shitty one, as ""BTL parasites"" are highly cost-efficient for the most part. Eliminating them will do nothing to property *costs*, and so any reduction in rents you get will be down to subsidy. 

You may get a short, one time, benefit to the public through a confiscation, but given that these properties are almost certainly mortgaged to the hilt, you will either need to service the mortgages or let the banks take the hit. Want to bail out the banks again? If no, then the shareholders take a hit. Ultimately part of the initial bill will hit the public purse, in the form of reduced tax revenues, bankruptcies etc.

More importantly: Nobody would be stupid enough to privately invest in building or renovating property for rental purposes any more, as they'd expect further confiscation. As a result, the state would need to take over building property for those who can't or won't buy, and would need to put up the capital or guarantee for loans, and take on the same role as the buy-to-let landlords take today. There's little reason to believe the state would be more cost effective in that respect.

The government could then of course continue to offer rents below market. This is a pure subsidy. Nothing wrong with subsidies if they achieve a societal goal.

But beware the side effect: Any subsidy of this sort drives up property prices for everyone else, as what happens is this group can now afford to spend more on housing.

It does not in any way address the real problem, which is lack of *supply*. Increase the housing *supply* by increasing housing density and building more reasonably priced properties, and prices will eventually come down. If you're going to pour tax payer money into allowing more people to obtain cheaper housing, pouring it into increasing house building would be far more effective.

true,1337_Mrs_Roberts,eu,European Union,"You know, I'm a small business owner ... and still think this is overkill. From purely the business perspective.

The landlord has correctly identified that he has *potential risk* in housing benefit tenants. The risk has been realised in some cases (those benefit claimants in arrears). The article doesn't say, but I got the impression most of the housing benefit tenants still pay their rent on time.

The key to managing a business is to reduce the risks *to acceptable level*. And the level of acceptability is very different in different businesses and is dependent on the size of business as well.

Now this landlord has decided to manage this potential risk by removing the potentially bad tenants altogether. This move has associated costs. Every change of tenants costs money for the landlord (new leases need to be managed by staff, not all units can be let directly the day after the previous occupant is gone etc). This is major drain on the profitability.

For me, new leases for 200 flats has lots of costs for too little direct benefit. Frankly, I would think a 1000 unit strong business could handle more risk -- the benefit claimants are only 20% of the leases and only a portion of those are problematic (and he has exact data on this number). I could understand this better if the business had exactly one flat and the livelihood or the landlord depended on the profits of that.

Of course it's impossible to say anything definite about the acceptable level of risk without knowing what is the business financial and debt structure, but this feels like overkill for such a large business.  Unless this is actually a strategy to raise the rents in new leases in one go to a much higher level.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; The 1000 private tenants would not be homeless, they'd stay exactly where they are. However, with their home converted from buy-to-let to social housing, their rent would no longer be 6% over the mortgage cost for the property.

Why in the world do you think that? Do you own a house? Are you aware of the maintenance costs? Further, rents include a whole laundry list of other costs, such as insurance.

If it is indeed 6% over the mortgage cost, then that's a bargain. I wish it only cost me 6% over my mortgage costs to maintain and insure my house.

But that's not surprising as for large scale buy-to-let landlords the biggest return comes from long term capital appreciation, not from rents.

But secondly, what you describe is simply a subsidy. The rental costs are as they are as a function of market demand, and the government could alternatively simply have rented out at the same rate. Thus any reduction the grant is a subsidy over the market rate. If they want to give a subsidy, they could do that without confiscation too. 

It's a terrible use of public money, as it does nothing to address the supply problem.

&gt; I wouldn't want to see a communist revolution, but if the government threw up a million new homes to be rented out on a not for profit basis the cost of private renting would drop substantially and contemporary landed gentry like the couple in the article would no longer be making huge profits from people unable to get on the housing ladder.

They could rent it out on a for profit basis, and the cost would still drop. However beware the side effect: Far fewer people would be able to justify financing house building in the face of such a drop, so the government would need to be prepared to take over the financing of far more property than what it wants to increase the supply by.

I still fully support that - it's a vastly better use of public funds than subsidising rents without substantially addressing the supply issue.

Note, though, that without addressing structural issues, such as massively cutting through planning issues (people would have to be prepared to deal with substantial increases in housing density) and releasing land that are now not being built on (cutting into parkland and other things), and cutting building costs (reducing unit sizes, using cheaper materials, importing cheaper labour, relying more on prefab etc.) the cost savings for society as a whole will be quite small - house prices and rental costs would drop, but the tax bill would rise.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"&gt; If you don't mind me asking, and I'm not trying to paint you as 'greedy evil BTL scum' - what kind of price do you charge rent vs mortgage repayments? 

No problem. I have quite a good yield, far higher than a lot, as I bought the house in 1998 and lived in it paying a repayment mortgage for 12 years which only had a few years left to go so my LTV is only 50% after the equity release. Someone on a 75% LTV would have maybe 1/4 of the profit I do. I'm also doing it as interest only mortgage which I'll explain the reasoning for at the end.

Mortgage payment is currently £258 a month and the rent is £500, leading to a profit of £2900 less expenses. Fixed annual expenses are £150 for insurance and about the same again for gas safety checks. Then there's any repairs which crop up which this year so far have been a new thermostat/timer on the central heating and a new TV antenna and mast. 

Usually total expenses every year tend to come to around £500 so an annual profit of roughly £2500 which is taxed leaving £2000. Just as a comparison, the person on a 75% LTV would be repaying £400 a month on their interest only mortgage for the same house so would have a profit of £700 a year (based on my expenses) which would then be taxed putting a whopping £560 a year in their pockets, barely £10 a week. 

I reckon sometime in the next 2-3 years I'm looking at a complete central heating replacement that'll cost me whatever that costs plus putting my tenant and kids up in a hotel for the week it takes so that's at least one years profit completely wiped out and possibly half of the adjacent year as well.

If I were on a repayment mortgage it'd be completely different and the central heating replacement would leave me in the shit as you'll see. On a repayment mortgage the repayments would be £366 a month leaving £134 a month profit less expenses or £1608 a year. However only the interest is tax deductible so I'd still have a £500 tax bill and with the £500 costs I'd have only £608 a year clear. Two months missed rent or a 1% rise in the mortgage rates would see me having to find the money from elsewhere to cover the mortgage and tax bill. And that's why I went interest only as it gives me some wriggle room. I also hate to think what position someone with a 75% LTV would be in. They would have to take money from their job to pay it.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; It's not irrelevant if he uses external insurance

It is irrelevant because whether or not he uses external insurance, averaged over a large enough number of properties, the cost will not be drastically different. In fact, with a sufficient pool of properties, his cost of self insurance is likely to be substantially lower than external insurance.

What is relevant is whether or not the risk for this group is so severely disproportionate that the insurance cost would be insane. 

&gt; These people are in such a high risk group of not paying rent that no one will insure them, and as much no one wants them as customers.

The insurance company is in a very different position, because they do not have direct insight into the tenants, and as such they have to account for the risk both of a non-paying renter and an incompetent landlord: A large landlord could come to them with properties he'd subsequently rent out to a 1000 heroin addicts who'd never pay rent, and not follow up the properties well enough to minimize the impact of taking that risk. By taking away the landlords risk, the insurance company further reduces the landlords incentive to put lots of effort into minimizing missed payments. The risk to the insurance company is thus high.

A serious landlords risk, assuming he does a basic amount of reference checks and puts normal effort into follow up, is substantially lower, as they know what steps they take to keep risks down. 

The insurance still makes sense when available for a smaller landlord because of how it pools the risks that the landlord can not accurately account for. 

But the lack of insurance does not translate into some ludicrously huge increase in risk for a serious landlord. It just means the risk is hard enough to accurately predict - insurance companies have no problems offering insurance for extremely high risk events, but the event needs to be sufficiently predictable. 

&gt; It might be a shitty situation, and it is more the governments action that has caused this than anything else, but you're blaming someone for being ""greedy"" when he's simply trying to ensure his business doesn't lose a shit load of money unnecessarily.

If he'd lose a shit load of money on it, then his rental prices are too low, and/or he's incredibly bad at judging the quality of individual tenants, rather than painting all of them with the same brush.

I simply do not believe that the increase that would be required for him to self insure against the risk of temporary delays in getting the money (cash flow risks and interest) in most cases, and the occasional loss of a few months in the case of someone who just stops paying and need to be evicted, would amount to much over a pool of properties this big.

And the market *will* bear that, because these people will need to be housed somehow, and that will ensure pressure on the market locally.

&gt; Now maybe you think all landlords are greedy

See my other comments on this thread. While I ultimately believe it'd be better with public ownership, I don't actually believe that would save much money - I do believe most landlords are relatively cost-effective for society and not actually able to extract all that huge profits (or the banks and private investors would be lining up with even more aggressive mortgage solutions for them), but that does not mean I can't also find moves like these shitty and sign of greed.

On top of that I think that the absolute biggest reason we weren't getting the results we wanted earlier this season is that we were 1) learning a new system and 2) all out of form at the same time. If you think about it, though we had individual players playing well in different parts of the field, the overall team was just not playing very in any aspect of the game except maybe attacking midfield. Now that has changed and we're winning games. 

I can also see us finishing 2nd even if we do nothing exceptionally wrong. City does have a really good team and it's equally likely that they'll win it.

I think anything less than 2nd can be considered a let down for this season. Yes, we have a new manager, but we also have a very, very good team and should play like it.

To me, one thing that points more to planning as an issue is the truly awful size of a lot of newbuilds; not only are many effectively below the recommended size for a family home with everything completely crammed in, but they have miniscule gardens. This suggests housebuilders are squeezing every last drop of revenue they can out of sites where they have been allowed to build.

What might well be the case is that whilst the middle of the market is constrained by planning laws, the bottom end is simply not profitable enough for housebuilders to bother with. In the 1930s they were building huge numbers of houses, but for the middle classes.

true,uk_finance,null,null,"The highest loan to value you can get nowadays is 95% - this can be either a direct deal with a lender or using the government's help to buy scheme. So for a £200K purchase you will need at least £10,000 deposit. You will also need buying expenses (conveyancer fees, stamp duty land tax, mortgage fees). Factor in anywhere between £4,000 - £10,000 (edit 3 - £4,000 is a much more realistic figure) for a £200K purchase. Your problem is likely to be servicing a £190,000 mortgage, because the lender will apply income multiples to assess how much they will lend to you. For a single applicant this can be *up to* 5 x salary plus a proportion of bonuses, overtime etc. This only comes to £150K based on your increased salary. For joint applications they lend varying figures, such as 4 x first salary and 3 x second salary.   So a joint applicant might help you secure the full mortgage amount. Lenders tend not to like parents getting involved. They could act as guarantors but this isn't likely to secure the additional mortgage amount. They wouldn't like your parents being the joint applicants because you would effectively be renting off them, so the entire loan would still be dependent on your earnings.

This is honestly a very bad expectation to put on any manager, but especially on a manger who had been with a club for 1 1/2 seasons.

In modern football SAF and Wenger are complete statistical outliers not only in their longevity but their success. It takes an amazing level of talent as well as a shit load of luck to have that type of situation. The manager needs to not only be talented but there is very much a ""right place, right time"" factor that goes into that level of success. 

There is just far too many variables at play that can effect a managerial position to predict that someone can rival the greatest manager in PL history.  Its an unfair expectation for the team and the manager.

If AVB had been with us for 8 seasons at a high level of success, then the conversation of ""what might of been"" is somewhat reasonable (Even that is a stretch). But after a season and half to say someone could have been on the level of SAF is ridiculous, a season and half is just too short and in today's footballing world is really just a normal tenure for a manager.

Just because you are unable to reply to it doesnt mean others are too. You are extremely presumptuous when you use ""No one can reply"". That said the downvote is an individual discretion i really dont care how people use/abuse it.

&gt; People that post intelligent, researched comments get upvoted more because they are more interesting and promote more discussion.

Its one thing to upvote a comment that you like, but it is not in symmetry with a comment that you downvote because you find it difficult to comment on it. By this rationale you will downvote every comment you dont comment against.

&gt; I'm talking about comments, and so is OP. Of course a thread asking people to speculate on signings is interesting. That's why we all love the YNWSA threads.

Now this is totally irrationale. You are ok with a whole new thread without any actual content, but hate a simple post in a thread of 500 messages.

&gt; I hate seeing bad comments. I would like a high standard of discussion on the sub. 

But downvoting a benign comment, you stymied the discussion possibility.

If it were not for private landlords then there would be a greater shortfall of properties to rent. Do you think that local councils would not increase their rents and be more selective over tenants if market conditions allowed them to do so.

1. Yes, there is legal responsibility to ensure a minimum standard is maintained. However, that does not cover everything and there are landlords that don't even meet their legal responsibilities until forced.

1. I don't know where in the UK you live but that is completely untrue in my area. There is a glut of low priced houses on the market and very few investors buying them. Added to which, you know  nothing about me or my aims and motivations which are nothing like what you assume. 

1. You clearly don't understand the economics of financing buy-to-let property. The rent finances the mortgage, insurance, repairs and void periods between tenants with very little left over given the stagnation of rents over the past few years. When I sell the property I will still have to pay back the original mortgage - even though the properties are worth less at the moment. 

Not all landlords are greedy, thieving leeches looking to make a financial killing (in fact, most are not) and, over the past 10-12 years, we have been subsidising our tenants.

I feel this author misses the point of Moffat's work on Doctor Who. Refusing to answer the question or to provoke another Time War was a decision. 

The Doctor was going to take his secret to his grave. Clara, a friend and companion of the Doctor for some time now - she witnessed him attempt to commit genocide and then save his entire planet for god's sake - convinced the Time Lords that it doesn't matter who the Doctor is apart from being the Doctor. He makes people better. Every saved life is another victory. Every natural death is a victory. The Time Lords - as is well established in the show - gifted the Doctor with a new regeneration cycle to prevent his death, prevent a war, and to perhaps eventually lead to their salvation. 

I'm tired of the tired criticisms people have of Moffat. They lend a false perfection to RTD's tenure, and misunderstand the nature of Moffat's tenure. Moffat's show *is* about the Doctor.

A big, centrally controlled system can not know what is best without inputs from the people it 'serves'. The system will always lack essential information needed to produce a good service.

A better system would be competing health care systems. When there is strong competition in a sector producers are forced to bring down costs while improving on the good or service or else they go out of business. An example would be the smart phone industry.

If the government had a monopoly on building cars do you think those cars would be an improvement in any way to what we have today? How could the government know what to produce without the input of the customers buying, or not buying, what they want? How could they know the money was well spent without competition showing something better could be produced with fewer costs?

The welfare state along with minimum wage is also a burden. It doesn't help the poor it does the exact opposite.

The HST (InterCity 125) was initially rolled out in the [Western Region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity_125#South_West_England_and_South_Wales). And there are (or were) lofty [plans](http://www.ctc.org.uk/news/2012-07-26/new-rolling-stock-to-replace-high-speed-train-fleet-announced-potential-for-good-cyc) to electrify part of the GWR, and develop an electric/diesel-electric train which would use electric lines as far as Bristol/Taunton - then diesel the rest of the way. 

I wouldn't be surprised if [Dawlish Sea Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Devon_Railway_sea_wall#Maintenance_and_the_future) was sucking a lot of the money from the Western Region. The problem with Dawlish Sea Wall, and the Somerset Downs (as far South as Exeter, even), is that the water risk (from waves in the former and flooding in the latter case) means electrification would be almost prohibitively difficult. 

Changing the route to an inland route would allow electrification as far as you'd need, and the old rail line can be converted to an A-road to bypass Haldon Hill which regularly buggers up Devon in the winter.

I was thinking certainly post privatisation, the introduction of what was intended to be an interim train 30 years ago (and is still being used today) is not really relevant to my point. 

&gt; And there are (or were) lofty plans[2] to electrify part of the GWR, and develop an electric/diesel-electric train which would use electric lines as far as Bristol/Taunton - then diesel the rest of the way.

There are plans - the IEP programme - but as you say, it doesn't really benefit the further south west. I think IEP is planned to terminate at Exeter, with a few HSTs being retained for services to Plymouth and Penzance. I'm not sure why this is, since it would have to be bi-mode anyway to run to Taunton and Exeter, would it be such a big fuss to scrap the HST entirely (and its related maintenance costs) and use IEP exclusively down to Cornwall?

The rest of your post really summarises my point exactly - it's apparently ""too difficult"" and ""too expensive"" to do better. If this was pretty much anywhere else, the logistical challenges would be overcome and money would not be a problem (see £50 billion to be spent on HS2).

None of this changes the other improvements that could be made, and have been made elsewhere. For example resignalling in Cornwall, which is still mostly mechanical signalling where almost every other major main line has been resignalled several times over.

that comes from the private sector who's sole motivation is not the good of anyone or the development of social society but profit.

and with a drive for profit you get cutting corners, manipulating statistics, poor suppliers and sub standard materials used, the cheapest and worst trained staff and generally boat loads of corruption.

not the ideal thing to be backing up any medical procedure.

the public sector have proved them so good at running institutions that effect everyone on a daily basis, just look how the banking sector helped all the normal foke out since 2008 ...... ow

as for health care im sure all the recipients of the duff breast implants think that competition and the race to the bottom was a good idea for there industrial grade silicon.

&gt;If the government wanted to help the poor they would cut regulations and minimum wage laws allowing those people to get a regular job and accumulate some wealth.

yes because if they cant accumulate some wealth at £6.31 p/h they sure can at £4 p/h that will help the poor.

true,samjengland,null,null,"For an open ticket Brighton - Annan you won't get much cheaper than £120. A lot has been done recently to remove inconsistencies that make split ticketing possible, especially in Scotland.

There aren't actually a huge number of calling points where you can split a journey and it makes a difference - the main ones which make a difference are generally when it comes to avoiding travelling through main hubs like London, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham - and as you mention Cardiff.

In your case travelling Brighton to the North, you're right in saying avoiding London is the best place to start when keeping fares low. You can travel through Reading or Kensington Olympia.

You can get a £17.40 advance fare Brighton - Oxford via Redhill and Reading for instance - but the issue is getting North from there. Technically you could probably find an XC advance fare which gets you from Oxford - Newcastle direct and then use a Northern Rail service Newcastle - Carlisle.

In reality though a lot of the time it's balancing out the cost with the hassle involved - that might save you £50 but is that worth 6 hours or more extra travel time.

Having thought about it, the quickest way to get a slightly cheaper,  still direct fare would be splitting at Birmingham.

Advance fares London - Brighton are as cheap as £5, and there's an FCC only ~£11 super off peak ticket.

There are loads of VT Advance singles EUS - BHM from £15, and London Midland tickets (the slower train) from £6 which takes around 2hrs as opposed to 1hr 20.

You can also get an off peak return on this journey for £25 with a YP railcard. VT allow off peak tickets to be used at peak times in conjunction with a railcard.

From there you'll be able to get a VT fare from BHM - Carlisle Open Return for £85 (It's £100 to Annan for some reason) then Carlisle - Annan for £6.80.

After all of that you're still only saving £20-30, but you could technically be on one train London to Carlisle via Birmingham with two separate tickets, as VT now run most EUS - BHM - GLC/EDB services as a single service (which is advertised as such) - so journey time/hassle isn't increased greatly.

It's worth noting also that if you're travelling beyond one of these main hubs to somewhere not far from the hub (but within the the immediate region/PTE area) - then splitting at the hub is generally a good plan because tickets around cities are subsidised by local PTEs - i.e. GMPTE in Manchester, SPT in Glasgow, Centro in the West Midlands, Nexus in Tyne and Wear, TfL (effectively) in London... and you can generally find special rates in those areas.

Welfare is being ruthlessly torn apart by the right wing media and the government is making attempts to dismantle the NHS, but public opinion is very much in favour of both those things, in my experience. While some feel that the welfare state is enabling a generation of layabouts, this is not the consensus, and most people acknowledge that it is a necessary structure but just wish it was harder for people who are lazy and scamming the taxpayer out of benefits could be stopped.

Of course they are, I never denied this - but they're not the _entire_ capitalist class, and today they're not the most important nor influential part of the capitalist class.  Back under feudalism, they (and the military class) were the be all and end all, but that ended with the industrial (and French) revolution.  Then it was all about the merchant class under mercantilist capitalism.  Under industrial capitalism, it was, unsurprisingly, the industrial capitalists, the factory owners, and more recently the financiers under financialised capitalism.  Obviously, in each period, members of the other groups had some - even great - influence, bankers have always been around and have held the ascendancy at many times in history, landowners have become more powerful again in recent times since the lows they reached when the Whigs tore over the Conservatives or when the industrial classes in Paris sent them to the block one after the other.

&gt;Where have you explained how anyone will benefit from such a move?

Here, for example: ""increased ""flexibility"" in labour markets, a less organised working class and a collapse in dissent against the economic system"".

&gt;Where have you shown any evidence that this was the intended consequence? Or that it being an intended plot is more reasonable than it being an unintended consequence?

I've never been asked for such evidence, but where consequences are overwhelmingly likely, one can infer intent, and outcomes are remarkably consistently in favour of ruling class interests for it to be an entirely stochastic outcome.

DHL supply last minute components and support, and were getting paid a pittance compared to the equivalent jobs in JLR; DHL staff went into negotiations and were frozen out over several months, even JLR were suggesting DHL raise things fairly - but no, DHL valued profit over people.

So - the union ballotted for strike action, people did strike, DHL coughed its bollocks out its mouth, and agreed a fair pay rise.

My and partner lived on Edencroft, Wheeleys Road by Five Ways, 10 mins walk into the centre of town.  We were paying £550 for a 2 bedroom flat, council tax was £100pcm, water was £40pcm, gas and electric I think we paid a direct debit of £50 a month eventually - typically we overpaid, so after a while you can call up the company with proof that you are being charged too much, so they reduce it.

Then we'd budget £200 a month for food (this would also include cleaning materials).

All in all £1k a month covered everything, we just set up a joint account and direct debited into it, and if say one month we didn't spend as much on food then after 12 months you might have a surplus of cash sitting around, which we used as spending money on holidays and such.

Now I live in Erdington, paying £545 for a 3 bed house with a garden, and allowed to keep cats.  Not much difference in rent, but we get more for our money, and more freedom (hence the cats).  Helps not being on a 3rd floor as well.  Everything else costs pretty much the same.

Heres a top tip, regardless of where you move to.  For food shopping, forget supermarkets etc.  Go to the Bullring indoor markets, buy all your meat and fruit/veg from there.  You will save yourself an absolute fortune, I wish I'd clocked onto this when I was living in Five Ways.  For £50 I can fill up 3 shelves of my freezer with meat that will last me easily a month, covering lunch and dinners.  For the best deals go on Saturday afternoon around 3-4pm, they close down at 5.30 and don't reopen till Monday so they shift whats left at crazy prices - you'll see big crowds gathering waiting for the deals.

But even going at any other time, its still massively cheaper compared to any supermarket, and tastes a hell of a lot better too.

I agree. The debate seems hugely confused on both sides. Salmond has argued that the Union is merely “institutional”, based the BBC, the army, and so on and that Scotland and England (*pace* Wales and Northern Ireland) have very little in common, culturally. Which is both disingenuous and historically illiterate. There isn't an invisible force–field across the Cheviots, there's a gradual cultural shift (although the jurisdiction of course changes crisply). 

If the issue is cultural, and if it's about self–determination then the oil is a red herring—the people of Scotland should want, and deserve, independence *even if* they are financially worse off for it in the short term. Meanwhile, the unionists would have us believe simultaneously that Scotland would be basket case (in economic and other terms) if not propped up at great expense by the Union *and* that the Union is better off with Scotland as a member!

It's mentally and emotionally battering. Like me you're lucky enough to have great parents who can offer you a home base while you get stuff together. 

I recommend getting a trade. I'm training to be a carpenter an am learning about all aspects of building from the people I work for and love it. I go to college 1 day a week to learn the theory side and college was free because I had a letter that said I was on jsa.

There are a lot of unadvertised jobs for labourers and you can earn £40-50 a day I cash and learn a trade while you're at it, also when I need some extra cash I work for a pub on the weekends. 

Bar work isn't great to do full time. But a lot of places want staff to just work weekends. Only working Friday and Saturday nights will probably get you +£70 a week. 

I'd suggest throw yourself at any job you find. It will at least get you out of the house and motivated to work. It also gives you networking opportunities. A lot of part time work can become full time.

true,karajgil,null,null,"I sort of agree with the writer. The companions that RTD were people who the rest of the world would look at and not think much of. There wasn't really anything special about Rose, Martha, or Donna. The doctor found ordinary people and gave them the chance to be extraordinary. That is one if the things I really love about  Doctor Who. I related to rose instantly. At the end of each companions time with the doctor I got the sense that they had changed irrevocably and for the better. Whether it be in big ways or small, each companion left knowing that they were worth something. That they HAD made a difference in the universe. Donna's ending was so sad and gut wrenching because she would never know all the good she did for people.

Now let me just say that Amy is my favorite companion. Her spunk, attitude and way of interacting with the doctor so engaging and fun to watch. I love her story line with Rory and River. But in my opinion her story lacks something that the other companions have. Maybe it's because she was already so sure of herself that she didn't need the doctor to prove her self worth, an admirable trait, I can't quite put my finger on it. But I get the feeling that Steven Moffat doesn't like to write ordinary people. He likes a good mystery(Clara's identity) or plot twist (the pandorica being based around Amy's life). Clara just doesn't do it for me. I haven't decided yet whether it's because she hasnt been around long enough for her to grow on me or if I don't like her character. Also, I find the whole stuffing her into all the doctor's story to be really stupid. That's probably why I don't like her.

And I also agree that doctor who is more about the companions than the doctor. Sure, he's the main character but when I think of doctor who as a whole, I divide the show up into companions and their story with the doctor. However their story ends is the end of that story line as a whole. When rose is with 9 and 10 it's part of one story arc. Rose 's story arc. Just like 11 and 12 will be one story arc with Clara.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Well, the changes to universal credit and people being given their money directly has increased the instances of people not paying their rent when on housing benefit. So getting rid of existing tenants isn't that crazy a situation - it's one a lot of people will find themselves in, in order to cut risk of losses in the near future. It's also likely that these changes have stopped insurers from guaranteeing payment - people on housing benefits have basically gone from being almost guaranteed income to the highest risk group in one fell swoop by the government legislation.

I kind of doubt he's suddenly decided to do this without any outside factors having affected the situation with tenants on housing benefits, anyway. He was clearly okay with them at some point in the past (and he's been in this game for a while), and now he isn't. Change of heart, or change or situation leading to a business decision?

One thing I don't get though - why are these called evictions? Surely he doesn't have grounds to actually evict someone due to this, but merely not renew their tenancy after whatever contracted period has expired? If this is all month to month then he can get rid of them all pretty quickly, too, but it's not eviction is it?

2) Everyone saying the author is missing the point....is missing the point.

RTD offered substance. Moffat offers flash. Stories have always been a form of entertainment and distractions for people. There is almost always some entry-point character (Luke in Star Wars) who is the ""every man/woman"" that the audience relates to. As things start to get crazy, the audience experiences the events WITH the character. Without that entry point we're just watching.

I think that's the key issue here. Under RTD I felt like I was in the TARDIS with them. With Moffat I feel like I'm being dragged along and have to ""keep watching"" and ""pay attention"" because I may miss something I'm supposed to care about (as dictated by Moffat).

The final paragraph really sums it up:
*Under RTD, Doctor Who was about “the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal.” Under Moffat, it’s about impossible men and impossible girls doing impossible things in an impossible box. The soul has been pushed aside to make room for the puzzle. And I’m getting pretty tired of it.*",1,1388852277,null,0,false,0,ceh5ulb,t3_1ue0nw,t1_ceh5ulb,t3_1ue0nw,null,1431795993,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Yes, everyone works for their own self interest. If the private sector wants to make a profit they have to provide something of value for the customer. When the customer buys the product both he and the producer benefit.


&gt; just look how the banking sector helped all the normal foke out since 2008 ...... ow

The banking sector is second only to the nuclear industry when it comes to regulation. Why do you think the banking sector is a good representation of a free-market? It is the last thing that could be considered a free-market.

&gt; as for health care im sure all the recipients of the duff breast implants think that competition and the race to the bottom was a good idea for there industrial grade silicon.

This is not an argument against free association and the free market.

&gt; yes because if they cant accumulate some wealth at £6.31 p/h they sure can at £4 p/h that will help the poor.

You are on a roll here because again that is not an argument against my position. I explained this in my first post - the costs are greater because of inflation, regulation, import tariffs and the government strangle hold on big sections of the economy loosen those restrictions and the cost of living goes down.

&gt; when you need a major operation are you going to take the NHS option or open it up to the free market?

All my operations have been private. But, once more that is not an argument!

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I am growing increasingly concerned about radicalised Muslims here in the UK, and the way people have 'given them a chance' - yet still there are mosques where hatred against everyone is preached.

I too am concerned that there seem to be a lot of radical extremists in the news, but I wonder whether that isn't a result of the way the media report things. There are moderate Muslim imams and community leaders, but we don't hear enough of them, perhaps because it isn't considered very newsworthy.

&gt;I ask this question not as a xenophobe or religous zealot - but if the people in charge of this country are allowing this kind of extremism to foster - what is their end intention?

I really don't think anyone is power is trying to encourage it - it only leads to more crime and fear and public disorder - but it is perhaps an unintended consequence of treading too softly around some groups of people instead of asserting common values that muslims and non-muslims can agree on: kindness, charity, etc.
(It's there in the Qur'an, go look for it - it's not all Old Testament warring and smiting).

&gt;I said before when the guy who absconded from custody and got changed into a Burkha with help from a Mosque to make his escape, why not close down the mosque, bulldoze it - send a signal that this is not OK behaviour.

Most of the people who use a mosque are not criminals. What kind of signal would it send to bulldoze one? I don't consider that acceptable behaviour; it's dangerously close to a pogrom, like when the Nazis destroyed synagogues. You wouldn't expect someone to destroy an Anglican church just because a criminal or three were using it. How can you justify that for any other religion?

&gt;Insert details of grooming gangs, money laundering, justice system evasion because of 'cultural differences' - it is spinning out of control.

I really don't think it *is* spinning out of control. I think it's being reported more urgently and dramatically now by newspapers which are seeing their readership decline and are desperate to keep selling papers; and they do it by telling horror stories to scare the shit out of people.

&gt;Extremism and antiquated views are not something we need to allow to grow any further here imho, and are not compatible with our society - we need much more visible law enforcement and governmental involvement for dealing with extremists and *anyone* that harbours, educates, supplies or keeps them safe.

Agreed. And this is not about religion. It's about tolerance and moderation and acceptable norms.

I appreciate it's an oxymoron, but I don't see anything wrong with asserting that we won't tolerate intolerance.

Of course, bad stories are never the actor's fault, but his run was cut short after being riddled with so many problems both on-screen and behind the scenes, and for many years he remained many people's least favorite Doctor--at least until the audio adventures came along. In the audio adventures, his Doctor really shines and he has had good scripts and character development and all that good stuff; he's probably more popular now than he ever was when he was on screen. 

I would encourage you to watch some of his episodes but to keep what I've written above in mind. Google a bit to learn more if you're interested. Then go listen to some of the audios.

And regardless of what you think of his Doctor or the stories or whatever, there is no doubt that Colin Baker himself is both a fantastic ambassador for the show and (from everything I've learned about him) a stand-up guy all around.

The reason I don't like Moffats writing as much as Russels is that his plot arcs takes up too much space, and that doesn't leave much for him too have individual episodes without anything plot arc related. I know that Moffat can write really good individual episodes, in fact my favourite episode ever is ''The Girl in the Fireplace'' and of course ''Blink''. If you look at the sixth season the story arc takes up really much space and I don't like that. But I have to say I really liked the 7th season.

And why some people doesn't like Eleven i think is because they just are just ''grumpy'', because it was when the eleventh was the doctor when the show became big in America, in the same way some Pokémon fans say that only the first generation is the best and all others suck, because they were the first. Maybe that was off topic.

Well in conclusion, some people are just grumpy and they never really accept the eleventh to be the great doctor he is and they are just grumpy.

true,SkyeFlayme,hartnell,Hartnell,"Ok, I don't hate Moffat but I also don't like his period running the show. I can't comment on those who hate him for some reason, but I can give you my reasons for disliking his run. 1. He rushes things. He's a great writer that has written some of my favorite episodes but I have found that he sucks a pacing sometimes. A lot of episodes feel like they're going full tilt right to the end to make sure they fit the time slot and as a result I sometimes find myself having a hard time following along.2. His writing is more about events than it is about people. Arguably you could say this is more like classic Who but just because that is how it was done before doesn't mean it's best. I prefered Davies' approach to writing about people better. Don't get me wrong though, Davies wasn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and in fact wrote some of my least favorite episodes. I just feel RTD was a better show runner and had a better style of writing but Moffat is the better writer overall... but that's all opinion.3. Dark. I find the overall tone of the show is much darker. Don't get me wrong, I love dark and tragic, but I'd love something a little lighter every once and a while. Once again, opinion.I guess it comes down to I preferred RTD's run. Both had their strengths and weaknesses but for me RTD's style is what pulled me in more. So I'm sad for what it's become under Moffat.

true,nichdavi04,null,null,"The west coast mainline is the busiest train line in the world. It connects London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh (combined population 24 million) and carries 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. Most of the line has trains running at 125mph (201kmph).

Because of this heavy usage, routine maintenance is required more often and is much more disruptive.

The fact that you're complaining about a rail system that provides high speed travel between ALL major cities, on modern tilting trains, and reasonably fast transport between just about anywhere else in the whole country, while at the same time carrying huge amounts of freight everyday, says a lot about British attitudes to their country.
We have very good transport infrastructure considering it is based on a Victorian system that had no precedent system in the world. It's easy for China to build from scratch a high speed network between a couple of cities with no worries about local protests or planning permission, disputes about the cost, and considerations about local services and freight sharing the same lines.

People in this country seem to have a very low tolerance to any delays or problems with public services. I'm sure many people blame the government for the freak tidal flooding, and yet those same people would be mocking them if there had been warnings which came to nothing. 

As for the moon landings, well if it had been anything more than just Russia and the US comparing dick sizes then I'd possibly agree that Britain should have been more involved. You can't tell me that it's a coincidence that with the end of the cold war, space exploration got less interesting.

The UK is a country that does well for itself and tries to do well by the rest of the world as well. It gives significant aid to foreign countries in need, and is currently sending aid to Argentina(!) as while there may well be contention with the Argentine government over the ownership of the Falkland islands, if there are people that need aid, that the UK can provide, then it will.

So I agree, there's much to be concerned about. What do we need to do?

1. If Muslims are going to integrate successfully, we need to cut off large scale immigration from the countries that contribute to increasing the size of the diaspora. This is politically difficult but possible.
2. UK foreign policy. Now this is a tricky one. It's the reason given by pretty much all extremists for why they carried out their acts (you're killing muslims in Afghanistan etc.), and they do have a point. And these wars have been pretty stupid anyway. Conversely, the 'Muslim solidarity' feelings of a minority shouldn't dictate British foreign policy. Also the instability in the Middle East means Britain may intervene again. Then there's the UK's support for Israel (at least relative to support for the Palestinian Arabs), which isn't likely to go away. In any case I would hope that with the coming to the end of the war in Afghanistan this should help things.
3. UK government policy needs to be clearer about what is and isn't acceptable in Britain. If the views of extreme Muslims conflict with British customs, the extreme Muslims will have to adapt. Tolerance of difference is a virtue, but it can only work with some shared values, and if these shared values don't exist, then tolerance can be damaging.

Ten was actually my first doctor, but after seeing two episodes on PBS I went to watch the series from the beginning. I was confused, who is the new guy and why is HE the doctor? So, did I start with Ten or technically Nine? Timey Wimey or whatever. 

Anyway, the biggest issue for me? Please don't down vote me for having an opinion, but … 

1. I feel like the mystery to the Doctor is disappearing with Moffat. 

2. I feel like there is so much hype over developing arcs. And then there is that feeling of, oh … that's it? (Example was building up hype in press about how we are going to finally get an explanation as to how the Doctor has more regenerations … and they just came through a crack. It's anticlimactic, though I understand it is a to be continued.)

3. I just feel things get recycled with Moffat. Like look at how many creatures and characters we had with RTD? And this is perhaps the thing I miss most about RTD … he had a way of having a character appear in a single episode and you had the urge to feel for them or want more of them. Jenny, Lady Christina de Souza, Adelaide Brooke, even River. And when kept at that, you had a greater appreciation for them (just as much as the mystery of the Doctor in point 1). The only time, off the top of my head, that I felt that in Moffat's era is with Vincent Van Gogh. 

As for creatures? Angels, Angels, Daleks, Silence, Silence, Angels, Silurian Vastra, Sontaran Strax, Silence, and keep on repeating. I understand it is pivotal to the arc set-up by Moffat and you have to respect it, but it just feels like it is a crutch in some ways if that makes any sense. (Like more CG, cinematic scenes, less artists and prosthetics for new characters?) 

I don't know, but that's my quick and dirty as to maybe why people may feel that way. At least how I rationalize whist typing into the small screen on my phone, with only a single draft, to a conversation that can be deep and go on forever.

The man was just out of the time war having caused not one but two genocides. He was hurt and fragile and humanity saved him. He fell in love with humanity and that's what Rose represented. Humanity with all it's flaws and glaring inconsistencies was still full of potential and just what the doctor ordered. 

Then we look at Moffats era. The doctor who forgets. It is all about the doctor. He lost the love of his lives to another dimension. He lost the one companion that could go toe to toe with him after the meta crisis. He reverts back to a child like state and his first companion was a child. Things are going to be doctor centric and it took the events of the 50th anniversary for him to pull his head out of his ass. He shifts from the doctor who forgets to the doctor who will remember every line of his lives ... Except how to fly the tardis. 

What Moffat has done is portray a doctor who very much knows he is at his end. Who wants to live as long as possible and who just does not want to go to trenzalore.

After waiting nearly an entire series, we finally learn that Abby was created by Laura and then what? Nothing, except maybe a passing joke. We as viewers have no idea how a ""figment come to life"" would act and now that we (and Abby) finally know that she's one, we should've seen that internal struggle come out or had it expanded upon, but because it was never mentioned again, it was pointless for the character (other than to finish up a plot-point). Since she is Laura's imaginary friend, shouldn't she have at least brought her up again or had a stronger attachment beyond ""this is weird, see ya later.""? And then when Abby starts to care for something (the tortoise) and he's brought into human form, it's not treated as a ""Abby is finally learning to care about something and be her own person"" it's more ""oh look that cooky Abby with her tortoise obsession."" And then once he's turned inside-out, she goes back to being apathetic (since he's never mentioned again). If she's going to be apathetic, have her be consistent with it. If she's going to shuffle between apathy and genuine care (over Laura, the tortoise, the gang, etc.) then it should be done in a way that we believe she's developing as a character, not just jumping between emotions when the plot calls for it.

Abby is one the main 5 characters in the series and just having her character ""not care"" isn't enough to justify her doing nothing or not getting a storyline.

Those who are really home dry and making a ton of money are those who have paid off the mortgages, either because they've been doing it for decades or were lucky enough to see a rise in some of their properties enough to repay mortgages on others.

&gt; Is an interest-only mortgage just where you pay the interest on it back, not the capital?

Correct. Usually when its a private buy you set up a repayment vehicle to repay the balance at the end of the mortgage period. They used to be typically known as endowment mortgages as you'd take out an endowment policy however that is a seriously tainted name.

For too long, there's been a direct syphon from the taxpayer to the banks via HB tenants and private landlords. Essentially HB has been a mechanism for subsidising bank shareholders. If BTL landlords are declining to let to HB tenants this shows that the subsidy is being cut back.

I hope that since the private sector is no longer an option, this will stimulate the building of lots of social housing, which is the best way forward.  

If this happens, then Fergus Wilson will learn that the value of his investments can go down as well as up. 

He's leveraged to the hilt and quite vulnerable to a small dip in property prices. Maybe we can help him learn this lesson sooner by promoting the UK European Rail Freight Corridor.

Not necessarily. Unless you have anything else to suggest it was deliberate, then Hanlon's Razor comes into play.

The Time Lord Triumphant conceit makes the Doctor the most powerful being in the universe by default. He could destroy whole species all willy nilly. He could alter the course of whole planets by showing up. He even has control over the dead. 

Also, there's no sense of consequence with Moffat. When this Doctor does the impossible, he gets rewarded for it. Save the Universe, get erased from existence, have a fairytale girl will him back into it. Stage his own death, get some peace and solitude for some time, and get married at the same time. He cross his own timeline in the biggest way possible, and came out the other end with no real sanity issues. Even Clara came out of it okay. 

Atleast with Davies, the Doctor got punished for doing the impossible. Take the Time vortex out of Rose and he lose that regeneration. Get rid of the Cyberman and the Daleks through a giant drain plug and he loses Rose. Reset the planet to forget about the Master/ Harold Saxon's tyranny and he loses the other Time Lord. Save the Earth by killing the Daleks and Davros, and he loses his best companion. Preventing Rassilon's plan, which means he's better than the God of his species, costs him that regeneration. Atleast Tennent's Doctor hadsconsequences with his impossible actions. ",0,1388856013,null,0,1388864956,0,ceh75rt,t3_1ue9az,t1_ceh75rt,t3_1ue9az,null,1431796679,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

The US Constitution was mostly needed because federalism was still a pretty untested idea and I would argue that the 'Bill of Rights' which most people want a constitution for was a (possibly unnecessary) afterthought.

Besides which, I don't think it guarantees anything in and of itself. Look at segregation - In 1896, [Plessy v. Ferguson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) decided that segregation did not violate the 'equal protection' stipulation of the 14th Amendment. In 1927 apperently it [did not either](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lum_v._Rice). But by 1954, [apparently it did](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education). The text didn't change.

No, clearly I should have listened to you when you said they are part of a sacrificial occult group paedophile ring. Because who needs evidence when you have conjecture mixed with cognitive dissonance, right?

&gt;Giving people money that they have to give to someone else is not a good way to teach budgeting.

In theory, it is a good way to teach budgeting. If they were to go out and gain full-time employment, this is *exactly* what they would be doing: being given money from their employer, to then give it to their landlord/mortgage company. Trying to ensure they become familiar with the process at least makes sense. The problem seems to be that they didn't (a) take the time to ensure DSS claimants had some sort of training and/or education on budgeting and (b) ensuring some sort of failsafe to reduce arrears.

&gt;It is a good way to complicate the process of getting money into the hands of the landlord, and most worryingly, encourage arrears by giving tenants the newfound opportunity to delay paying rent!

I agree that it complicates the situation. The *simplest* thing to do is to pay directly. No chance of arrears, no problem, happy landlord, happy tenant. However, it means that if/when the DSS claimant comes off benefits and goes into full time work, they are totally inexperienced in how to deal with any of this. Just like when someone has their mother cook for them all their life and then move out or go to uni. Unless their mother has taken the time to show them how to cook for themselves, they will often find themselves at a complete loss as to how to make even the most basic of meals for themselves.

What's the best solution? No idea.

RTD's strength is relationships, Moffat strength is concepts.

People are social creatures and we're driven to connect with people. When you're watching the Doctor and Rose interact, you can relate and empathize. This forms an emotional connection between the viewer and the characters. 

Moffat's Doctor is basically Willy Wonka, a tour guide to the surreal. As cool as his ideas are, people can't emotionally connect with concepts. That's why ratings always went down when RTD would take the Doctor to places off Earth. People can't relate, they can't connect, and they lose interest.

I just wish Moffat didn't have this formulaic obsession with tying up loose ends in such a short time span. I liked the show under RTD because it was charming, and exactly what DW needed at the time, however the show has to mature (not in terms of its content, more in terms of its narrative style.

I think you're wrong here. I'd say her entire story arc, such as it is, was exactly right. She didn't have depth as a character because there was none. She started as a mostly blank slate and by the end had a tiny sliver of history and personality. I get that it bothers you but I think they gave us the story they wanted to tell and made it consistent for the entire run of the character.

Proper sessions and top level sports don't work out well. 

When he came in, there were a number of things that worked in his advantage. Firstly he was actually trying, he was putting 100% in training and in the game to impress the new manager. Secondly, he was in amazing form and had confidence, thirdly and most importantly- defenders didn't know the best way to play him. 

Once defenders were drilled in staying close and nudging him off the ball, all he did was go flying at the slightest touch. That may have got him a pen in the past, but it is not going to fly with Premier League refs, especially once he gains a reputation.

He has no strength, and a mediocre second touch- and however good his first touch is if he cannot find the space to use it, he is never going to score.

E.g. constitutional freedom of speech, any law which would contradict freedom of speech could not be enacted in this case without first changing the constitution. It is also more inclusive of rights to the people. 

I.e. compare the statement ""everyone have the freedom to express themselves in any matter of way without interference""(freedom) vs ""The government may not limit peoples freedom to express themselves""(limit). The first statement protects everyone’s freedom from the government and other people who may want to limit a persons freedom. Whilst the second only limit the power of the government.

true,horrorfixxx,null,null,"The main gripe I have with the Moff is the way he insists on relying on ""mysteries"" that are never properly resolved or answered instead of just building actual season-stretching storylines. Everything is always a riddle wrapped in an enigma topped with a secret and it always feels really forced and practically never actually goes anywhere. It's all just questions, questions, questions, and basically never any answers or payoffs. It's like instead of writing stories he doesn't write stories and just *tells you* he wrote stories.

That and the way he writes women as interchangeable punchline machines with basically no real substance. All of his female characters act and speak essentially the same way on the page and really only redeem themselves because people like Karen Gillan and Alex Kingston are talented enough to make it work. Amy's crack in the universe, Clara's ""impossible""-ness, River Song's entire character. It's like he just says ""Get me a beautiful woman and I'll give her some sassy things to say and pretend there's some great big mysterious thing going on with her without ever actually explaining what it is or why it's so important"" and expects everyone to think he's so clever for it...

Don't get me wrong, a lot of things *have* improved under his administration. The show's never looked better than it does now that it's shot in HD and has a bit of a budget. Every episode looks as good as a movie and I adore it. I also think he and Matt created a really good Doctor. I love Eleven to bits.

Moffat's not a bad writer or anything, he's just entirely too proud of himself and not half as good as he seems to think he is. And he seems to have no idea how to structure a narrative thread that runs through multiple episodes written by different people, which was easily Russell's greatest strength and my absolute favorite thing about his time as the head of the show. I'd let Moffat write Doctor Who for the rest of his life if he wanted to because he's talented -- just take a look at The Empty Child or Blink or A Christmas Carol; dude can write an individual episode like few others -- but I'd sack him as the showrunner today if I could.

While the Moffat episodes during RTD's run were some of the best, it wasn't because of Moffat alone. They were effective because Davies had developed the characters and we cared about them. Story only matters when you care about the characters, otherwise why are you watching/reading? Moffat started out well enough with Amy as the girl who waited. The first episode was pretty good, it introduced a new character and kept us (the audience) with her as the Doctor was gone. After that it just became ""Let's add more characters and zany adventures and convolute any connection and relation the audience may have to the characters!""

Yes, RTD got a bit soap-operay. I'm not sure I'm completely on board with all of that, but I can suggest that the sadness Rose felt at the end of her series was an expression of how sad the audience and creators/producers of the show were because she was leaving. It sort of fit. We had seen this girl from Cardiff go through so many things and we were right there with her the whole time. Her leaving the show was, in a sense, a piece of ourselves leaving. This is why people have issues with Doctors changing. People are used to a specific one, have grown attached and the show becomes woven into the fabric of our actual present reality. When that changes, it's hard for people. For actual real people. When Tenant left I thought ""Well, the next guy won't be Tenant...but that's okay. Let's see where he'll take us.""

Left wing academics teaching an objective view of a war? Can't have that, we need to replace it with proper, patriotic teaching. All wars we are involved in are just, this is Britain after all!
Teaching about the ridiculous tactics the generals used? How dare you!  Respect authority, the people in charge know exactly what they're doing. The tactics used in WW1 were ingenious, just ignore the huge number of deaths and the fact that there was such a huge stalemate. Telling your soldiers to run out into no mans land into machine gun fire and artillery while the generals sat in huts away from the front line took real skill and courage. 

Some even have the nerve to call the elites at the time ""out of touch""! What a ridiculous notion. Everyone knows that people only get to the top if they are competent and intelligent, just look at Gove for a prime example of this.

Secondly, I don't think you have the faintest idea what it actually means.

The definition, broadly, is a seemingly insurmountable problem suddenly being resolved by the introduction of a new character, object, event, or some-such, which is usually so unlikely that it challenges the suspension of disbelief.  It's often used when someone is considered to have written themselves into a corner.

Let's look at the first few Moffat episodes:
1.  The Eleventh Hour. The Doctor writes a computer virus that will broadcast the number zero globally, and is linked to Rory's phone, enabling the Atraxi to home in on his location.  He uses existing technology in a logical way.  Not a Deus Ex Machina.
2.  The Beast Below.  The Star Whale is released when the ""abdicate"" button is pressed (essentially, a form of ""protest"" button designed for the Queen).  The concept of ""forget"" and ""protest"" buttons is littered throughout the entire episode.  Not a Deus Ex Machina.
3.  Victory of the Daleks.  Dalek technology  is used to send spitfires into space to disable their ship.  This technology and its use is the very core of the entire story.  Not a Deus Ex Machina.

true,arelefsee,null,null,"Inter Milan have rejected a £13 million bid from Chelsea for Fredy Guarín, their Colombia midfielder, but are prepared to sell the 27-year-old once their £15 million valuation is met.
José Mourinho is eager to bolster the centre of Chelsea’s midfield to consolidate his team’s position as Barclays Premier League contenders and his leading target is Guarín, who can also play on either wing. Negotiations are at an advanced stage.

Mourinho has denied that Chelsea will add another forward to his first-team squad during the transfer window. “A striker, 100 per cent no,” he said. “It is not a priority, it is not an option. We have three. The market is open, but for us almost closed.”

Chelsea have been linked with Gonzalo Higuaín, of Napoli, but Mourinho insisted that the Argentina forward is “a player I know we cannot get”, while finances will dictate that the Italian club, managed by Rafael Benítez, cannot sign either David Luiz or Juan Mata.

Mourinho admitted that Kevin De Bruyne, the midfielder who is being courted by Wolfsburg, has failed to settle at Stamford Bridge. “We know he fancies a move,” he said.
Napoli are hoping to beat Liverpool to sign Alberto Moreno, the Seville and Spain left back.

**Long shots**
  
Gustavo Poyet, the Sunderland head coach, has ruled out selling Steven Fletcher this month unless the club receive a huge offer for the Scotland forward. Fletcher has struggled with injury and form this season and has been linked with a move to Celtic, but his 11 league goals were pivotal in avoiding relegation last May.
Poyet is eager to reshape his squad, but does not wish to lose the 26-year-old. “If someone comes with a crazy offer for a player, he will go, but of course I don’t want to sell Fletcher,” Poyet said. “He’s our top scorer. He’s the one who is going to score the goals and make the difference.”
Newcastle United do not need to enter the market for a centre half, with Alan Pardew, the manager, revealing that Fabricio Coloccini’s knee injury is not as bad as first feared. He is likely to be out for a maximum of six weeks.

West Ham United are close to signing Lacina Traoré on loan from Monaco. The Ivory Coast forward will leave the French club until the summer, subject to a work permit.

&gt; No-one robbed us. We robbed ourselves. We made choices and these are the consequences – of New Labour, of Thatcherism, of the Coalition. Blame migrants if you can’t bear looking in the mirror, but know this: it has never been their fault and it will never be their fault. If life stinks, it’s because we voted for it to stink. And it will keep stinking until we do something about it. No amount of border controls or charging for the NHS will change that.

&gt; This isn’t my Britain, yet it is. I played a part in all of these decisions. I didn’t do enough to stop it from happening. I haven’t fought hard enough. And if I don’t fight now, I can’t complain. I can’t complain, when it all fades away.

A-bloody-men.

What we really need in this country is a pro-EU (albeit a reformed EU), liberal party that does not hanker for the votes of the pensioners but tries to stand for a model of Britain younger voters are energised by.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Shit article that just aims to make people angry. Then again neither Gove nor the NS is qualified to comment on this. Here's a reply to a question I asked on /r/AskHistorians about this point of view. There is a very mainstream section of historical opinion that basically agrees with Gove:

&gt;**Magneto88**: The argument that Gary Sheffield and others put forward is that British and French democracy was a better alternative to the militarised rather non democratic German Empire. In addition to this the German Army's behaviour in Belgium, it's willingness to break various social and military taboos and the rather obvious German plans to dominate Europe after the war (annexation of Belgium, parts of Poland, puppeting of Eastern Europe) were all signs of a morally wrong enemy that had to be defeated for the good of Europe. Thus the Entente victory over the Central Powers was worthwhile because it protected liberal democracy (indeed the war advanced it in Britain), protected the rights of the European peoples, liberated Belgium and France and prevented the development of a German dominated Europe which would have been openly hostile to Britain and detrimental to its subject peoples (aside from the Germans of course!). This is actually the view that dominated in Britain throughout the war but is oddly not what has been passed down in mainstream memory. Instead we have this idea that the war was a horrible waste, nothing was achieved from it (mainly because of the rise of Nazi Germany) and that everyone in the country was against it. This is entirely wrong and it's what the historians are arguing against.

&gt;Other historians disagree with this idea, there's the 1960s era school that believe that the war was entirely a waste, a horrible cataclysm that was pointless and terribly led by the British Generals, who were callous and uncaring about the casualty rates inflicted upon their men. On the other hand you have modern revisionists such as Niall Ferguson, who argue that Britain entering the war in the first place was a tragedy because a German victory would have led to a relatively stable and prosperous Europe under German dominance like the modern EU.
The second strand to the modern revisionist school's idea that centenary should celebrate the victories, is that Britain won the war and it did so in a very impressive fashion. In Britain we're rather prone to self-flagellation over the Great War and dwelling on the losses at the Somme, Passchendaele etc. They've had many many books written on them, are taught in school and form a part of mainstream conception of war and WW1. The great British successes of the Hundred Days Offensive are barely mentioned in mainstream society meaning that the public has a skewed view of what WW1 was and doesn't understand that the Somme and Passchendaele were steps towards the British Army forming war winning tactics...just like the British mistakes through 40/41. The country should be proud of this victory, achieved after four gruelling years, and proud of the brave and heroic efforts made by the soldiers that served in that army. Much like Britain views the Second World War.

&gt;So what these historians are arguing is:
A) The war was worth fighting and achieved a worthy goal in defeating the German Empire. The events that happened in '19-'39 were not inevitable, nor did the First World War cause the Second. If things had developed differently then WW1 would be remembered as it was immediately after the war, as a necessary cause fought bravely by Allied forces to a final victory. Thus World War One and the effort made should be remembered in the same light as WW2 and not as a bloody mess that achieved nothing other than another war twenty years later.

&gt;B) In winning the war in 1918 the British Army showed exceptional skill and ability and it's these battles that should be better remembered amongst the public rather than this outdated idea that the British Army in WW1 was inept and that the experience of the First Day on the Somme was repeated throughout the war and the Army never learned anything. This is entirely wrong but unfortunately it's not so far from what many of the British public believe because of the work of historians in the 60s/70s and it's subsequent deep integration into British culture.
&gt;&gt;**CanadianHistorian**: I am going to reply to your post, because it's not quite answering the question as you have, but rather responding to the arguments put forward by Sheffield and others.  My colleague and I addressed this issue in a recent blog post that was a response to Sheffield's article from a few weeks ago...

&gt;&gt;There is a degree of hubris displayed by many English-language scholars regarding the First World War. In particular, that the British ""civilizing mission"" or ""process"" was somehow justified because Great Britain operated on the theory of a liberal democracy. I'd be curious to see whether contemporaries in mining towns like Swansea or industrial cities like Manchester and Glasgow enjoyed all the benefits associated with such a glorious democracy. Let's not begin to consider Africa, Indo-China, and elsewhere across the globe. Only until very recently have historians, like [Adrian Gregory](http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Great-War-British/dp/0521728835), bothered to reassess some of these comfortable certainties.

&gt;&gt;This is where history and memory collide. Some claim that by 1918 the British army was fighting a war of “liberation,” to rid Belgium and northern France of its German occupiers. While this might have been true by 1918, the idea that this sentiment was widespread in August 1914 is specious at best. But, for historians critical of the “pipe and drum” interpretation of Britain’s involvement in the Great War, trying to reconcile the differences in Germany's plans for expansion and Britain's attempt to maintain what had been for some time the result of an aggressive and expansionist enterprise is extremely problematic.

&gt;&gt;As early as 1971, Joachim Remak, who fled Nazi Germany in 1938 and eventually taught history at Stanford, put things into perspective. [He claimed,](http://cuwhist.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1914-the-third-balkan-war-origins-reconsidered.pdf)

&gt;&gt;there had taken place, in the half century or so before the war, a tremendous expansion of British power, accompanied by a pronounced lack of sympathy for any similar ambitions on the part of other nations. If any nation was compensation-conscious it was Great Britain...If any nation had truly made a bid for world power, it was Great Britain. In fact, it had more than bid for it. It had achieved it. The Germans were merely talking about building a railway to Baghdad. The Queen of England was the Empress of India. If any nation had upset the world's balance of power, it was Great Britain.

&gt;&gt;This type of argument doesn’t win over the hearts of people in those countries that fought alongside Great Britain, but it does offer an important and different way to look at the past that doesn’t make it into school curricula. While perhaps exaggerated, Remak makes a good point. Other aspects of the past are also ignored in the majority of First World War interpretations. Consider, for example, the Chinese labour corps (numbering some 130,000) brought over to Belgium and France during the conflict, many of whom died as a result of disease or maltreatment and have been interred at Commonwealth cemeteries in Europe. Is this much different from the stories of maltreatment under Imperial Germany?

&gt;&gt;Britain’s involvement in the Great War had more to do with maintaining worldwide dominance and a fear of relatively rapid German growth, than trying to create a better world in which liberal democracy could be spread. Look no further than the peoples of colonial territories subjugated by the British (and French and Belgians) and try to identify where the benefits to involvement in the Great War fell. Great Britain greatly contributed to the imbalance in twentieth-century politics.

&gt;&gt;These issues raise a number of questions about how “history,” as far as a critical reading of the past is concerned, fits into any type of Great War centennial event. What role do historians play in all of this if we are to be honest in dealing with our past? Did going to war in 1914 ensure global stability and security?

&gt;&gt;It’s not wrong to commemorate the immense loss of life during the war, but laying out the details and reasons behind why so many young men died should be left to historians who can offer a critical interpretation of the past, not government officials operating on an agenda, nor journalists who often lack historical sensitivity and methodology. Near the end of his article, Sheffield says ""we should not lose sight of why the war was fought and the significance of the fact that it was Britain and its allies, and not Germany, that emerged victorious."" While stinking of the adage “history is written by the victors,” we should be most cautious of where the emphasis is laid. Did Britain’s victory lead to a better and more stable post-war world? Historians like Niall Ferguson would certainly disagree, and so would many historians with the ability to read beyond the English-language literature. 

&gt;&gt;In the end, we agree with Sheffield and many who share his conviction: the Great War was not at all futile. Britain’s involvement and eventual victory ensured that no European power could play “catch up.” No other European power could seriously threaten Britain’s global economic dominance, at least immediately following the war. This was just one fruit born out of victory. As we approach the Great War centennial, we should not forget the millions of soldiers and civilians who lost their lives in the conflict, but let’s also be honest with the past and be open to grappling with difficult questions about such a defining feature in European and global history.",0,1388859787,null,0,false,0,ceh8nw7,t3_1ue6dv,t1_ceh8nw7,t3_1ue6dv,null,1435538480,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, but those countries tend to be richer too. Anyway, you can't make the claim state-funded care outperforms a free-market when they aren't in direct competition.

The problem with the NHS is you are locked in to the care system, they already have your money and don't have an incentive for improvement. Without direct competition it is not obvious to the causal observer there are fundamental problems.

I have anecdotal evidence just from family experiences how the private sector provides a better service at a cheaper rate - years of treatment with 10s of specialists vs a few months with one private doctor. Lifesaving cancer treatment only being available through private care.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRn9ySc-RDM) is evidence of the market out-competing government mandated care. 

Also, I have heard in India the private healthcare system is outperforming state-funded care in areas where competition is highest.

The Rule of Law is as follows;
1. No man must be punished in body or goods without a distinct breach within the law.
2. No man is above the law.
3. Common law provides a better set of rights than statute law.

Parliamentary Supremacy is as follows;
1. No one can strike down an act of Parliament.
2. No Parliament can bind a successor.
3. Parliament can debate any topic it wants.

Both the Rule or Law and Parliamentary Supremacy is defined by A.V Dicey.

The Separation of Powers;
- The executive (government), the legislature (parliament) and the judiciary cannot overlap or control another.

This is defined for us by Montisque.

In recent times European Union Treaties also can form part of our constitution as well as the European Convention of Human Rights which is incorporated within our legal system due the Human Rights Act 1998.

Just an added note, every Act of Parliament is also considered part of our constitution.

You can get cheaper rents but these are in less than desirable areas, and you can bet the property itself probably wont be well kept.  Otherwise typically I reckon you'll be looking at £450 a month at the very lowest.

Don't know if you drive or use public transport, so bear in mind the additional cost of travel the further from your workplace you are - monthly passes for London Midland are not cheap, and they are frequently delayed, and even then are packed out completely.

Steer clear of: Handsworth, Aston, Nechells, Smethick, Winson Green, Lozells, certain parts of Erdington, Balsall Heath, Sparkhill, Small Heath and Sparkbrook are the main areas.  

Also avoid Selly Oak because it is primarily populated by students, and as such you will either end up being neighbours with noisy students, or otherwise the property will have previously been occupied by students and isn't likely to be well kept - the students don't care, and as such the landlords don't bother wasting money keeping the place ship shape either.

My advice would be to seek out the areas you do like and start looking at what prices are like around there - how close are transport links? How close is the news agents? Whats the surrounding area like?

This can help save you time when you're are ready to book some viewings.  Be prepared to be messed around by estate agents, they don't call them scum of the earth for nothing, sometimes I wonder how they stay in business.  I remember I booked 5 viewings in one day with different agencies, I only got to view 2 of those 5, and one of those was only because the present occupants saw us standing outside in the cold and invited us in - then proceeded to give us a tour, the letting agent never showed up!

The past has never had a better future. Because history is enjoying a renaissance in Britain. After years in which the study of history was declining in our schools, the numbers of young people showing an appetite for learning about the past, and a curiosity about our nation’s story, is growing once more. 
As a Government, we’ve done everything we can to support this restoration. We’ve changed how schools are judged, and our new measure of academic success for schools and pupils, the English  baccalaureate, rewards those who study history at GCSE. 
And the changes we’ve made to the history curriculum have been welcomed by top academics as a way to give all children a proper rounded understanding of our country’s past and its place in the world.
That understanding has never been needed more. Because the challenges  we face today – great power rivalry, migrant populations on the move, rapid social upheaval, growing global  economic interdependence, massive technological change and fragile confidence in political elites – are all  challenges our forebears faced. 
Indeed, these particular forces were especially powerful one hundred years ago – on the eve of the First World War. Which is why it is so important that  we commemorate, and learn from, that conflict in the right way in the next  four years.
The Government wants to give young people from every community the chance to learn about the heroism, and sacrifice, of our great-grandparents, which is why we are organising visits to the battlefields of the Western Front.
The war was, of course, an unspeakable tragedy, which robbed this nation of our bravest and best.  But even as we recall that loss and commemorate the bravery of those who fought, it’s important that we don’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict.
Our understanding of the war has been overlaid by misunderstandings, and misrepresentations which reflect an, at best, ambiguous attitude to this country  and, at worst, an unhappy compulsion on the part of some to denigrate virtues such as patriotism, honour and courage.
The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder, as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are Left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths. 
Professor Sir Richard Evans, the Cambridge historian and Guardian writer, has criticised those who fought, arguing, ‘the men who enlisted in 1914 may have thought they were fighting for civilisation, for a better world, a war to end all wars, a war to defend freedom: they were wrong’. 
And he has attacked the very idea of honouring their sacrifice as an exercise in ‘narrow tub-thumping jingoism’. These arguments are more reflective of the attitude of an undergraduate cynic playing to the gallery in a Cambridge Footlights revue rather than a sober academic contributing to a proper historical debate.
The First World War may have been a uniquely horrific war, but it was also plainly a just war. Nigel Biggar, regius professor of moral and pastoral theology at the University of Oxford, laid out the ethical case for our involvement in a superb essay in September’s Standpoint magazine. 
The ruthless social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified.
And the war was also seen by participants as a noble cause. Historians have skilfully demonstrated how those who fought were not dupes but conscious believers in king and country, committed to defending the western liberal order. 
Other historians have gone even further in challenging some prevailing myths. 
Generals who were excoriated for their bloody folly have now, after proper study, been re-assessed. 
Douglas Haig, held up as a crude butcher, has been seen in a new light thanks to Professor Gary Sheffield, of Wolverhampton University, who depicts him as a patriotic leader grappling honestly with the new complexities of industrial warfare. 
Even the battle of the Somme, once considered the epitome of military futility, has now been analysed in depth by the military historian William Philpott and recast as a precursor of allied victory.

There is, of course, no unchallenged consensus. That is why it matters that we encourage an open debate on the war and  its significance. 
But it is important to recognise that many of the new analyses emerging challenge existing Left-wing versions of the past designed to belittle Britain and its leaders. 
Instead, they help us to understand that, for all our mistakes as a nation, Britain’s role in the world has also been marked by nobility and courage. 
Indeed, the more we reflect on every aspect of the war, the more cause there is for us to appreciate what we owe to our forebears and their traditions.
But whatever each of us takes from these acts of remembrance and hours of debate it is always worth remembering that the freedom to draw our own conclusions about this conflict is a direct consequence of the bravery of men and women who fought for, and believed in, Britain’s special tradition of liberty.""

There are some lenders who will go above 5x salary but it requires a good credit file and a longer mortgage term. 

Most mortgage lenders have already or are in the process of getting rid of income multiples and replacing them with affordability calculators as it makes far more sense and MMR (Mortgage Market Review) changes are being applied. You may have two couples both earning the same, but if one couple has a kid and a car loan whilst the other couple are debt free and kid free, the latter couple have more disposable income than the former.

With joint applications, it's possible to also do more than 5x the combined income.

I mean - I returned to the country of my forefathers (England). Yet apparently I'm being labelled by people who have shallower ties to this country than I do? It has really stunned me the hypocrisy when black people label me racist on the basis of ""being an Australian"".

---

For an honest assessment of how the British black community stereotypes Australians please read [this vile blog artice](http://www.the-latest.com/blacks-should-go-back-home-if-they-dont-mayor) that made *false* accusations of racism that eventually got his [Australian target fired](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/7468434.stm).

Quotes include:

&gt; His comments about Black people are robust and as distant from being politically correct as his country

Stereotyping Australia here.

&gt; Him, a guy from a country where Black people are the ""Aboriginal"" indigenous nation who are stereotyped by the white colonisers as social security scrounging drunks, and me a confident, British-born Black activist and news media operator with a reasonable track record.

The irony of criticising someone that returned to the country of his forefathers. The blogger could always do the same or he should take responsibility for the historical behaviour of his adopted country, England, that invaded many nations.

&gt; I founded the all-party Anti-Racist Alliance

While still fostering a racist agenda against Australians as a group?

&gt; Curtly, he added:  ""I get where you are on the radar, sunshine."" Again, not a politically correct thing to say to a Black person.

For someone that likes to identify ignorance in others - how could he think that a country full of sunshine might not use that word as a friendly gesture? I certainly never knew it to have racist connotations in Australia and it saddens me that blogger was so culture-blind as to dismiss a minority in Britain.

Unfortunately this blog article has been severely edited since it came out in 2008 - originally it stated that he asked the Australian what Carribean voters should do who said they would leave the country if Labour lost; the reply ""Well, let them go if they don't like it here."" was amplified as a hate crime and resulted in the loss of a job.

I find Britain to be horribly racist; just that racism is acceptable if the targets are white. That includes Australians, Romanians, Polish. And blacks get away with extreme racism.

true,vicvonshroom,null,null,"While RTD's run has some really shitty episodes due to plot inconsisitencies(While Moffat's era does as well and some just the worst kind) but his era was filled with great character work. Moffat has written some good episodes, However as a long term writer, he sucks incredibly. RTD's season long arcs were almost always stupid as hell(I did love The Saxxon bit but not the follow up episode). Moffat's run is about his cleverness which effects his character work in a negative way to me. I do love Matt Smith though and feel he deserved a better writer at the helm for his years.

I'm rewatching the show and just finished the RTD era and season 5 has some stupid inconsistencies so far with The Doctor's character and I have a hard time liking it not due to just love of the better parts of the RTD era but because he's not that good of a writer and relies on happy endings and other bullshit to mask up flaws with the writing. RTD wrote some fucking dumb episodes but he also wrote great episodes as well. Midnight is one of my favorites and I liked End Of Time despite it being hated(I loved The Doctor's arc in it) and also loved Waters Of Mars. 

Spoilers for some episodes of season 5:


The Doctor lets a being created by The Daleks that could destroy the planet and be triggered at any time active because the robot has memories of a woman. Memories which we the audience have been told that were most likely faked. Bullshit. That's horribly irresponsible of The Doctor. The Space Whale episode has Amy end up figuring out that The Space Whale is so kind and didn't need to locked up but The Doctor couldn't? Another thing I call absolute bullshit on. I get that Moffat had to show that Amy was smart and could figure stuff out but when it something so ridiculously simplistic it feels dumb for The Doctor to have missed that. 

Now I don't hate every single iota of Moffat's run but rather the episodes he writes with a long term idea tend to blow hard and the characters in the new run suck. I don't give a shit about Clara or River for that matter and I liked Amy at first until she kind of turns the show in a weird kind of love triangle when her fiance waits a thousand years for her and she still has doubts. I dislike Moffat's run because he does make ridiculously convoluted characters just to be clever and mess around with the audience. He gives you a riddle but then tells you that you missed that background detail that he never even hinted toward at all whereas RTD allowed you to figured it out in your head and when it clicks, it's fantastic. Utopia is one of my favorite episodes as you put it together and then the master steals the tardis and it's great. Moffat tends to tease things that never ever happen(The Name Of The Doctor should have had the name in it right? WRONG!) 

RTD at least respected the characters whereas Moffat uses them as chess pieces to tell some story and ""out smarts"" the audience by never giving a full picture and telling you a lie of a twist. I do like some Moffat episodes but he is flawed and has some bad moments just like RTD did. 

I loved Day Of The Doctor but found that the old monsters that take human form were kind of pointless when the three doctor's could have easily stopped them but they let it happen until the whole nuke thing. It was a bit dumb. The Time Lords were shown inconsistently(They were horrible people in Tennant's time but now are worth saving?). Moffat did do a fine job though with it and I don't hate him but rather find that his run is not perfect or all that absolutely amazing either. 

I always describe Doctor Who like this: When it's good, it's great and when it's bad it's the worst but it's worth watching.

This applies to any era and I hope the next show runner has a better time with the show(however since it seems to be Mark Gatiss who sucks at writing Doctor Who episodes then nope).",0,1388862795,null,0,false,0,ceh9yti,t3_1ue9az,t1_ceh9yti,t3_1ue9az,null,1431798026,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Our midfield was outnumbered and somewhat overwhelmed today, it is a hazard of playing a 4-4-2. I would have liked to see Capoue in the middle today, he did a fantastic job against united and just as when he came off at Old Trafford we lacked cover for the defence and Arsenal exploited that. Bentaleb didn't have the effect I think Sherwood was hoping he would have.

What worries me is that Arsenal were sharper, we are still giving the ball away a lot and the passing is somewhat sloppy.

Tough game against a good arsenal team. Hopefully having no FA cup fixtures from now on should reduce fatigue and injury. 

That said, there are a couple of points id like to make about this game.

1) Playing 4 in midfield at the emirates is risky. Playing 4 in midfield at the emirates with bentaleb is stupid. Sherwood got this wrong tactically IMO. Does anyone know where Holtby is? I would have gone with capoue dembele and holtby in the centre if they are all fit. Or at least capoue instead of bentaleb.

2) Danny Rose is not good enough defensively. That was a very poor mistake that demonstrated his poor judgement and relative inexperience. I know alot of people rate him and I wouldnt mind him being an understudy to a more experienced LB but he simply doesnt have the quality we need.

Overall though, disappointing but not that important.

Try going to school where half the kids are Chinese. I did. That's because Sydney is *full* of Koreans, Chinese, and Taiwanese. Unlike the UK which has a tiny sector of Japanese in West Acton and that's about it.

And the kids at my school weren't speaking fluent English. Many of the Chinese kids were sent over by their families to stay with relatives while the parents stayed in China - hopefully to give their kids a better education. Us ""locals"" wanted to integrate with the Chinese kids but they usually kept to themselves in tight groups always speaking Chinese.

You can go around calling Australians racist till the cows come home but why don't you fucking well go there and live there? You don't know jack shit and making judgements pisses me off.

You know which Chinese kids we loved the most at school? The ones that joined in at recess and lunch. The ones that played handball with us. We didn't give a shit if they spoke English well or not. We had one friend who didn't speak hardly two words of English but he was just good fun to have around.

What about adult Chinese? Some speak English fluently.

1- To watch: The Aztecs, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, and The Rescue

To avoid: The Edge of Destruction, while it does come together in the end the majority of the episode is rather trippy and hard to understand.

2 - To watch: Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The War Games

To avoid: The Dominators, it's not really bad, but it's definitely the worst of 2's run.

3 - To watch: Spearhead From Space, The Curse of Peladon, The Green Death, The Three Doctors

To avoid: No particular episode, but if you are going to watch any episodes with The Master watch them sparingly, because after awhile he just gets annoying. Before it was 'who shall be the villain this time?', for 3's run it's just 'oh hi Master.'

4- To Watch: Robot, The Ark in Space, The Brain of Morbius, The Seeds of Doom, Destiny of the Daleks.

To Avoid: The Talons of Weng-Chiang, there has been some casual racism in Classic Who before (The Celestial Toymaker, The Pyramids of Mars, etc.) but so far I haven't seen anything nearly as bad as this particular episode.

- Players like lamela, eriksen, chiriches and paulinho gel within the team and, in Vlads, case get used to the league as a whole.

- We appoint an 'actual' manager at the end of the season. No discredit to sherwood but his traditional styles of play won't work every time and I would much prefer a De Boer type manager with tim as assistant.

Overall I'd say we need to work on taking chances the most. Players like  Soldado supposedly thrive on 1 on 1's and we haven't created too many clear cut chances and, when we have, there has been no end product.

He will be a great player, but may need a bit of time. Chadli, in my opinion, has looked decidedly average.

&gt; plant a mixture of trees at different rates of maturity it would take a few years for them to provide the sort of flora environment that's being lost

Near impossible to do, trees can only really survive being relocated/planted up to a certain age without essentially dying of shock afterwards or having such an undeveloped root system that they just get blown over. It is also very expensive to get anything much bigger than a sapling.

Ancient forest forms over hundreds of years and due to our lifespan we miss most of this, as a result it is easy to think it will get sorted in a few decades.

&gt; the animals a few years (or maybe a generation or two) later

The issue being with animals (as well as plants/bacteria/fungi etc) is that many only live in ancient forests so if the forests get removed the species will likely go bye bye. It isn't as simple as just hoping they turn up, especially given that some species only travel a matter of metres in a generation, if that. Further to this there needs to be a corridor of their habitat (ancient forest) between the new and old. This is of course assuming that the new site is an ancient forest, which it will not be.

You also have the smaller issues regarding hydrology, geology (inc soil) and climate at a new site which is likely vastly different from the original.

Overall this is very much a case of keep what we have and hope to expand them.

I just find that unbelievable.

Chiriches has been excellent and really stepped up to the plate. He can have his david luis moments but they've been few and far between thankfully.

Chadli has been solid but nothing special.

Baldini, Levy, who knows? AVB said yes to all of them, but that doesn't mean they were his first choice, so I can't really answer that one.

The length of transition lengthens every time we lose… it's a nice scapegoat honestly. Usually it can take up to 18 months for a player to truly settle and get his form. I do think that next season we'll see a very different spurs. A full preseason with all the signings will be good for the team.

Lamela has shown signs of brilliance but doesn't seem on the same wavelength as the rest of the team sometimes. We all agree he's better than Chadli, but has yet to really fill his role. Lennon is better at tracking back, too.

Similar to Lamela, Soldado doesn't seem on the same wavelength. He's been better up with Adebayor, but his confidence isn't quite there. They're both very intelligent players, as is Eriksen. When we have them on the pitch, alongside our brutish Dembele and Paulinho who play a somewhat different style of game, then it can get a bit shambolic. Where they want to nip a cheeky through ball, they don't find runners. Or where they attempt a nice skill, their shot doesn't quite come off. It's ultimately a gelling/confidence/ time thing.

1) Aside from Capoue starting over Bentaleb there wasn't a lot that Tim Sherwood could do in terms of the line-up or subs, injuries have simply tied his hands. I actually though it was a good idea to bring Chadli on to bring some width on the left and I felt we actually played better after it (although that could have been score effects). You could argue that Adebayor should have come off instead of Soldado but IMO Ade's form over the past few games makes Soldado the expendable one. 

2) Speaking of Soldado, target practice for that man, all week. This has gotten beyond ridiculous. I know he's done well for our build up play in recent weeks but he really needs to start knocking goals in against teams whose names we can pronounce. That said he was far from the issue today.

3) People need to lay off of Rose. By and large he has been good for us this year and one mistake (no matter how horrific) doesn't change that. He's not world class but he's a good option with the potential to get better. He was also far from the only one on our defense who spent too long on the ball (looking at you Chiriches).

Further I think that the supposed ""useless generals"" argument has been challenged in school teaching for a while. Certainly when I studied the first world war in school about 7 years ago these nuances were raised.  Perhaps I had very good teachers (I know I did largely speaking) but even so. Gove is lamenting an issue that just isn't the case. Yes a great deal of the population may hold this view, but they weren't educated within the last decade. I regret for this discussion that WW1 wasn't an area of study I pursued in my degree (and probably won't for my masters when I finally raise enough money) and as such my knowledge is only basic but my understanding is still that it was a war of tremendous waste, and utter utter chaos, and due to the failings of the elites after the war, failed to address any of the underlying causes of such a conflict.

Same goes for the whale. He was SO angry when he thought he had to sacrifice the whale. He even mentioned he couldn't call himself the Doctor after he had done this.

F.e. He doesn't like endings, so the ending of their relationship is also his beginning.....well if she stays ""half dead"" in Cal.

You're right, and you're also right that government and the civil service aren't set up to work like that, because the benefits of doing anything at all have to be quantifiable before you can do them. You can't get a budget for continuous, iterative improvement because after a few months you can't accurately project what the benefits would be. The civil service is obsessed with justifying every single thing it does, because they **will** get asked to justify it by MPs and ministers who will get asked to justify it by the media. From billion pound projects to individual cases everything has to be documented. You have to cost out and justify every single change and doing so is staggeringly slow, inefficient and expensive. Everything has to be rigorously standardised because you can't deliver a better service to some people than others without being crucified.

Maybe things are changing though, DWP did at least try to use Agile to develop Universal Credit, but they were doomed to fail as inflexible contracts had already been agreed. The requirement to outsource is another reason for inflexibility and bureaucracy.

Most bureaucrats would actually rather deliver an efficient high quality service instead of spend their entire lives planning shit and gathering statistics, but when you're constantly required to justify every minor detail of everything or document everything because you can't do it in-house then standardisation and statistics make up the bulk of the job.",0,1388866243,null,0,false,0,cehbgyb,t3_1ue0lb,t1_cehbgyb,t1_ceh8b1r,null,1431798697,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,xAorta,null,null,"Ok then, I will humour you and go through the post and pull up my faults with it. Gonna be in two parts as I want to run through all of the post to be thorough. 

&gt; I loved Doctor Who.
&gt; I really loved it.
&gt; I loved that I could enter this space where any ordinary person could become something extraordinary, where every person could do something to earn them that look from the Doctor, that radiant grin that said ""you brilliant thing, you."" Where white trash housemothers and shop girls and temps and med students and scared boyfriends and time-hopping con men could make themselves matter, not because of who or what they were but because of what they chose to do.

OK so far it sounds reasonable, one of the things the show does really well is show that we are all capable of being great or being complete bastards. Though I would point out that the authors post is sounding a bit like wish fulfilment and from the way they talk about the show it definitely doesn't seem like they have seen many of the classic stories. I have a feeling they would dislike them.  

&gt; Watching Doctor Who made me feel loved, as a human, as a girl, as a young adult with no direction in life. It reminded me that even though I had the capacity to be ugly and petty and small, I had an equal capacity to be brave and loving and extraordinary.

Again, very much like she is trying to make this show bigger than it is. The general point of the show having very good moral range, even with the title character, is a good one though.

&gt; That's what Russel T. Davies understood. He understood that people are beautiful and terrible, nasty and kind. The people in Midnight are more horrifying than the Monster, but the abrasive flight attendant sacrifices herself to save everyone. There isn't even a monster in Miracle Day, just panicked humans doing terrible things to each other.The government officials in Children of Earth is more horrifying than the 456, but Ianto's family and the people who fight back are filled with love. To borrow a phrase from War on Supernatural, The Doctor and the Monsters are just jello shots at a party. The stories are really about people.

A very common complaint with the RTD era was that he focused way too much on Earth, the Doctor can travel wherever and should be going to other planets too. All of these are very good episodes but they should certainly not be the only episodes offered. Otherwise we are basically asking for a soap opera. What is the point in there being a machine that can take you to any planet at any time if it stays on Earth, barring the odd space train with a bunch of humans of course. 

&gt; RTD understood people so well that he could make you fall in love with characters in a single line. He killed characters and it mattered and it hurt because they weren't cardboard cutouts, they were people.

This is the guy who had satan predict Rose dying in battle, and his ""Most faithful companions death"" and then played the ""well... shes dead in a kinda way guys?"" asspull in the last moment? No major character died in RTD's era, only single story characters. He even gave Rose a human doctor to go and have babies with and gave her her Dad back. I would say both writers have issues with death meaning death on the show. 

&gt; Then we get to Moffat and The Time of the Doctor.
&gt; Moffat doesn't bother to create more than cardboard cutouts. He believes in his own writing so much that he thinks if he tells us enough that we should care about something, we will. He tells Matt Smith to cry over Handles, the cyberman head we've known for all of one episode. He tells Jenna-Louise Coleman to tearfully beg the Doctor not to change, as though she's known him so long and they've been through so much together. He introduces a paper family for Clara (complete with Moffat's oversexed old woman trope) and expects us to care as much as we cared about Jackie or Wilf. Of course there's the Random Hottie with Implied Sexy Doctor History in Tash, the nun of nakedness for no other reason than a dumb joke. He throws in a relationship between the Doctor and Barnable, not that we know anything about Barnable. He creates a town full of stick figures that the Doctor loves enough to defend for hundreds of years.

Clara clearly sees 11 as 'her' Doctor, that is why she is upset. As for not spending much time together, she went through his entire timeline saving him, I would say that qualifies as a significant attachment to him. She helped him through the ending of the timewar and got him to reconsider his actions just before pulling the trigger. She has not been in the show very long from our perspective, but for the Doctor she is a very significant person, perhaps more so than Rose in some ways. The cyberman head was likely to show just how long 11 has been fighting this war, he is attached to that head like it was Wilson from Cast Away. It was not meant to make us feel something, it was meant to show where the Doctor was emotionally. The oversexed old woman trope? Like the old woman in Tennant's regeneration episode that helped Wilf? 

Just because a family is shown, does not mean it is for us to care about them. It would look a bit odd for Clara to be eating xmas dinner alone in a flat, so it makes sense to show her with people and gave us a little look more into her life outside of the Doctor. Were we supposed to care about that teacher in day of the doctor who spoke to Clara or is he just there because someone needed to talk to Clara? Barnable was also likely to show us just how long the Doctor has been fighting, he saw something of Amelia in the boy when the boy waited by the Tardis for him, and we all know how much of an effect Amelia had on 11 so it makes sense that 11 developed an attachment to the boy. He also likely buried Barnable during his 600 odd years fighting.  The nun of nakedness was pretty much just a silly joke, but there is no way you can complain about silly jokes as a reason for RTD being better when there was a set of farting fat aliens in his very first season. 

&gt; And then, assuming that we all care enough because he's told us to care enough, he slaps on a voiceover and throws in some montages so he can skip all the legwork of making us care. Not once, but like THREE TIMES.
&gt; We don't see people in this episode. We see The Doctor. We see him deciding to fight an unwinnable battle defending those who can't defend themselves like that's something new for him. Plot points are tied up and secrets are revealed like Moffat's going down a checklist.

Lets be clear about this episode. It is Matt Smith's final episode and titled ""The Time of the Doctor"". The people are not there for us to care about, they are there for the Doctor to care about. This episode is his and his alone. We see a lot of hints about stories that we are never told, lots of things left to our imagination like the 600/900 (no idea how long it lasted so I am going with 600) year relationship between Tash and the Doctor and about the God like savior that Christmas had for so many years. We aren't told these stories because they are not needed here, as much as I would of liked this episode to be expanded into a two parter.  

The thing that makes this new for him is he is staying. We say in Power of Three how he just doesn't really fit the normal life, and here he is staying in a town because not only do they need him, his own people do too. He is fighting for Gallifrey as much as anything in this story and hoping for a slight chance to be able to free them. Plot points needed tying up to give 11 a sense of closure... but it did seem a bit rushed with it all coming down to one conversation so there is a point there. 

&gt; He sort of fights. Clara sort of helps. Not that Clara has any real personal stake in this of course, because Clara is little more than a cute little wind-up toy to be wheeled in and out when the Doctor pleases.

The Doctor pulled the same trick to her as he did to Rose. Both fought back in whatever way they could to try to save him. Clara was fundamental to convincing the time lords to save the Doctor. How the hell is she not important here? This entire point is null and like the author didn't pay attention, or has an agenda in just not liking Moffat.  

&gt; And then the Time Lords help, I guess, and then leave? And Matt Smith gets an admittedly lovely speech and then regenerates. No people. This episode is all about the Doctor.

""Time of the Doctor"" not ""Time of the people the doctor is saving this week"". All I am saying here.  If you would like me to expand on this point I will need something more to work with than just senselessly saying ""but Doctor who isn't about the Doctor"" as if he isn't allowed the odd episode about him. 

&gt; Which. Doesn't. Work.

Complete opinion. While the episode had faults it worked great. If anything I would of liked them to stay with the Doctor longer in this period of his life. The idea of him accepting this is it and staying in one place for the centuries is something that would be cool to have had more developed.

true,xAorta,null,null,"&gt; Let's review. In Nine's regen episode, he was surrounded by people who were brave enough to take a stand against the oncoming Daleks and were killed, as well as the cowards in the basement who just wanted their winnings from Sattelite 5. Not to mention Lynda with a Y, who was too sweet to win Big Brother but stayed behind to fight, Mickey Smith and Jackie Tyler, who helped Rose to find her hope again even though they finally had her back, and Rose Tyler, who looked into the heart of the TARDIS to save her doctor. And yes, Nine has his own arc. He decides to be a coward instead of a murderer, because he's seen what all these humans are capable of and it's changed him.

So now all Doctor regenerations have to be like this? What about in 10s regeneration when Wilf and Donna are literally the only humans. Rose and Clara did very similar things in this episode really. They both got sent away to save their lives but both came back to help. 9 had a cool regeneration story, but that is not some template to be applied to everything or this show is going to get boring and fast.

&gt; In Ten's regen episode, we see The Doctor return to Wilfred because he's seen what he becomes without companions and it terrifies him. He's also afraid he's going to die and he's not ready to go. We see a father/daughter pair filled with so much vanity that they almost end the world, Wilfred, who wouldn't shoot someone during his war and stood by his decision, and Donna, who breaks our hearts because she can never be what she was (and the Doctor needs her so desperately). Ten dies because Wilfred does something silly and human. He rushes in and gets himself stuck, and Ten has to help him, because it's what he does. But he rages against it, and we see that Ten has a little ugliness in himself, a part that thinks he's better than these people, until he realizes he isn't.

I think the author didn't pay attention in any way. The Doctor never returned to Wilf. Wilf hunted him down. There was no ""i need someone"", although you could clearly see he regretted what he became in Waters of Mars. For someone who talks about people who we just don't care about in the episode, did they really give a crap about the rich people who helped the Master?! They were just cookie cutter ""i want to live forever screw you guys.""

&gt; Moffat's episode did the narrative legwork. He crossed his t's and dotted his i's, and I said ""Oh. Huh."" and felt literally nothing. There was no struggle (yeah, ambiguous stalemates make for THRILLING TV). There was no decision (heck, he only stayed there because his TARDIS came back late). There were no people. There was a cyberman head, a random kid, a nun with a vague past, a companion with no personal stake in anything, and a tritely named town populated by stick people.

The decision was to stay. He said it himself, he had argued about how someone else should take a turn every day for 300 years. How he wanted to live a normal life still, just because it is not a ""FATE OF THE WORLD HANGS ON YOU PRESSING THIS BUTTON"" type of choice does not make it any less of an important choice.  This author is utterly obsessed about people showing up. Just to be fair as this is a critique of Moffats entire run too... how about the girl who only wanted to meet the great warrior, the Doctor? She had a little time in the episode and still made a mark. The Doctors 3 friends in Strax, Jenny and Vashtra? The only real difference is we are not directly shown everything about them, maybe they should of showed more of them but they have been in a fair few episodes now. How about River? She has certainly been developed quite a bit throughout her run. Rory's dad was done very well, especially if you watch the extra to Angels take Manhatten. RTD certainly did characters better, but Moffat is not completely rubbish at them either. 

&gt; I wanted to feel something. I really did. But there was nothing to feel. I watched out of the same feeling of detached obligation that it seemed like Moffat wrote it with. Matt Smith acted his heart out, as he always does, but he can only do so much when he's surrounded by propped-up crash test dummies.

This is complete opinion. The writing for Matt seemed really good in this episode and addressed long standing plot threads that people had wanted answers to. This was fundamentally the Doctors story and I think the author has an issue with the entire concept of this episode. Another complaint I distinctly remember about RTD's run is that the Doctor never really saved the day when the season finale came around, the companion always saved him. This is all well and good every now and then but you start to question if this Doctor is really any good if he never sorts this stuff out himself.

&gt; Because here's the fundamental fact Moffat doesn't seem to get. Doctor Who is not about the Doctor. In RTD's Doctor Who, the Doctor carried the action while the companion carried the emotion, though sometimes they switched. In Moffat's Who, The Doctor is forced to carry both the action and the emotion, leaving the humans around him to pick up whatever tiny crumbs he leaves behind. Clara gets a line here, random side character gets to push a button here. And the end result is that there's nothing to care about.

This really just shows that the author would hate the classic series and really just liked RTD's Doctor Who, not Doctor Who itself. The Doctor was locked in a freaking cage and turned into Gollum in the season 3 finale, then saved when everyone on earth thought his name. The Doctor rarely carried the action when it came to season finale time. Has the author even seen episodes like the Beast Below, where Amy carried the emotion and saved the Doctor from making a choice that would destroy him. Moffat's Who also seems more open to the idea that the Doctor is not worthy of hero worship. Rory was a great character because while he liked the doctor in the end, he openly called him on his bullshit.

&gt; Under RTD, Doctor Who was about ""the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal."" Under Moffat, it's about impossible men and impossible girls doing impossible things in an impossible box. The soul has been pushed aside to make room for the puzzle. And I'm getting pretty tired of it.

There is room for both. Personally I think a middle ground between both would be perfect. RTD completely failed at ending his season finales, they all disappointed after really good build ups. Moffat, overall, has had far better finale episodes and single episodes. I also feel he has the better season archs. RTD does do better character development though. The ""soul"" of the show is still there, alive and kicking, it is just that the author only really liked the RTD brand of Doctor Who, this is what this entire post comes down to really. They want a wish-fufillment ride where they can imagine that the Doctor would choose them and they can fly away. Moffat's Who would be utter rubbish if he was just trying to do the same thing as RTD, the show evolves and changes and that is its strength. I guess maybe the author really should just stop watching as it is clearly not the show they want anymore.

No, he didn't. He made a thing that you liked (that certainly wasn't the same as Classic Who), and then a new, nasty man came along and changed it. But don't worry, it's not because his opinion is different than yours, it's because he's *wrong*. And *wrong* people are *wrong*, not just different.

But aside from the fact that it's been mentioned that a lot of the scrutiny of Moffat isn't applied to RTD, seemingly because of the rose-tinted glasses effect, it's really important to realise that it's all shit.

My housemate often refers to Moffat as the ""story"" writer and RTD as the ""character"" writer (similar to this Tumblr), and perhaps that's reflective of their influence as overall director (in what they directed their various writers to focus on), but it's not really true. Both RTD and Moffat have had good (and bad) characters, and both RTD and Moffat have had good (and bad) stories. To essentialise any more is ridiculous.

Actually, let's focus in on that first point and look right at the character of Donna. I mean, seriously? She's the singularly most obnoxious and unlikeable character in the Christmas Special, after which point the audience is repeatedly bludgeoned with the character point that **DONNA HAS AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND DOES NOT THINK SHE CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING**, before the Doctor shows her it isn't true (by fundamentally altering her DNA and changing who she is into a half-Doctor genetic mutant) and then erases her memory so that she never remembers any of it. Great. Good job RTD, I really think that reflects *growth* and *characters* rather than just *cardboard cutouts*.

Or maybe we should focus on Martha and how she **REALLY LOVES THE DOCTOR**. No, really guys, she has a **CRUSH ON THE DOCTOR AND WOULD LIKE SMOOCHES PLEASE**. But she doesn't get any, and then decides to leave before her dearth of smooches becomes to hard to bear.

Rose? No, I liked her. Amy? Great character. Rory even? Character who genuinely grows as we see him. Clara? Early days, but there's some potential there. But see? I'm not essentialising the series into ""Moffat"" and ""RTD"". Because they're not one thing; there's only ""things I like"" and ""things I don't like"".

But I like Moffat, and 11 is *my* Doctor. Maybe it's his weird aloofness, maybe it's his Fez, I don't know. Smith did it for me right from his first episode with fish fingers and custard, and just kept hitting high notes from there. Sure, the first half of the latest season had some duds, but the perfection of his first year convinced me more than ever that Doctor Who was the show for me.

So maybe I'm biased. Who knows. Who. Knows.

But for the moment, just this once, let's just admit that we all have opinions, that they are all equally valid, and that this guy (and everyone else who's ever made the same point) is just trying to justify his opinion in a way that sounds better than just ""I like a thing"".",0,1388867416,null,0,false,0,cehbzj7,t3_1ue0nw,t1_cehbzj7,t3_1ue0nw,null,1431798947,21,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,21

&gt;This research updates and extends former research conducted on this issue, based on the surveys of 1989 and 1992. In addition, data from the International Crime Victimization Surveys were used on total and gun-related robbery and assault (including threats). The results show strong correlations between the presence of guns in the home and suicide committed with a gun, rates of gun-related homicide that involved female victims, and gun-related assault. The profile is different for male homicides, total rates of assault, and generally, for robbery (committed with or without a gun). With the exception of robbery, most correlations were similar or stronger when all types of guns were considered, rather than handguns alone. **No significant correlations with total suicide or homicide rates were found, leaving open the issue of possible substitution effects.**

This is why politicians and newspapers have to demonise the young and go on about pensions and tradition all the time. Because it's mostly people in their fifties and beyond who still believe in all that stuff.

true,vicvonshroom,null,null,"I respectfully disagree. The season 5 hasn't made sense. The Dalek timer was only deactivated due to Amy bringing up and practically telling the Doctor that she wants to go to the bonezone with him and could be reactivated at any time by The Daleks who can time jump so it makes no sense to leave the thing intact and capable of blowing up but Moff-it let happy endings reign!

Tennant didn't sacrifice people. The only time I can think where someone he let deliberately be sacrificed was when Jack went into the radiation thing during Utopia and then I don't recall another time he sacrificed people. Hell Wilfred told him that he'd be fine sacrificing himself and dying but The Doctor saves people because that's who he is. He's mentioned a few times in 10's run that human were awesome and could be kind. 

The Eleventh was mad with the space whale but was told that it wouldn't eat the kids and had enough clues to put together what Amy did but he didn't because Amy had to solve it. 

I don't like the writing of River. She goes from being a smart and capable and loyal character to being a mary sue-ish character who serves to be a plot device and a love interest and it takes away from her character to me. It's not necessarily the relationship I had a problem with but rather the character and that she too like all 11's companions becomes a mystery he deals with and must solved which I dislike. I also dislike Moffat's writing of women in the show but whatever. I have the same feeling about Clara, good at first but quickly de-volved into just a plot device and a mystery for the doctor to deal with rather than a person. I'm sure that they may eventually flesh her out but as of now, she's poorly developed but I don't like any of the companions aside from season 5 Amy and Rory as I think they got worse as they kept them on as plot devices rather as good companions. This is all my opinion though.

The Nuke timer was just a dumb wrinkle to me that could have been stopped before it happened. The Doctor(s) knew that these aliens were going to do something and just watched as they laid the groundwork for it to happen? The Doctor has a few tangents where he spews out a speech about how awesome he is but does shit like this that annoys me. The Doctor is arrogant at times but almost never that bad with the exception of Water Of Mars 10 which was part of an arc though.

The Timelords I can honestly forgive as I assume that The Master wiped out the bad ones as they went back and the ones we see in DotD are different and later timelords. 

I want to state again that I don't hate Moffat but have a lot of issues with him as well as I do RTD. While I feel Moffat's plots are sometimes cooler or more intricate, I feel he tries to show everyone watching how clever he is rather than tell a good emotional story and sacrifices the characters at the expense where I think RTD succeeded with this.

In the short term, yes. Once production picks up there will be more wealth and fewer unemployed. But, what is more important is why are businesses having to cut in the first place?

It was caused by sovereign and personal debt, low interest rates and resource misallocation all which lead straight back to central planners. 

I am saying it is impossible to centrally manage an economy without knowing everyone's wants and needs. The problems with the economy will not improve with more taxes, more regulation and low interest rates. At some point interest rates will have to rise and the whole thing will collapse. Interest rates should be set by supply and demand and that can only happen in a free-market with free banking and competing currencies.

Professor Anderson has concerns around UK involvement in US signals intelligence collection but as a solution he suggests abolishing the UK domestic Security Service. Sorry, that just doesn't follow. I work in information security and have a huge amount of respect for Anderson as a security engineer but in this instance he's just wrong.

It would be lovely if the UK had no need for a domestic security and counter-intelligence agency but that's simply not the world we live in. Terrorism is a concern but not the only concern. Aside from that it's also MI5's responsibility to detect and disrupt activity by hostile foreign intelligence agencies. Nation-states have been spying on nation-states for as long as the concept of a nation-state has existed, and especially in the light of the Snowden documents, it would be stupid to suggest that the UK is not also a target for hostile intelligence agencies.

Yes, perhaps the responsibilities of MI5 could be taken over by the police but then the Hoover-type figure justifiably feared by Anderson could still exist. The only differences are that he'd have a different job title, and arguably more powers than the head of MI5 does as it stands in terms of powers of arrest, armed units, etc.

Rose made a huge defensive error and we paid for it, however it was not a 1-0 loss, we got overrun in the midfield coupled with inconsistent defending from lennon/eriksen esp when the wingbacks overlapped.

Try 0.6 in Switzerland, 0.9 in England and Wales, 1.2 in Northern Ireland, and a whopping 1.7 for Scotland (which ironically has even stricter gun laws than E&amp;W)

* Danger to people at ground level.

* Less disruption during heavy snow.

* Higher top speeds. 100mph seems to be the highest speed possible with third rail electrification systems.

* Greater efficiency. Third rail needs feeder stations every [1.5 miles or so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification_system#Direct_current). (Fourth paragraph of that link).

The line between Southampton and Basingstoke is being converted from 750 volt third rail to 25,000 volt overhead wires as part of the electrification scheme now underway. Apparently this will act as a [pilot scheme](http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2012/sep/third-rail.cfm) for future conversion of the rest of the third rail network in the South East.

Yes, third rail is a traditional part of the railway network in London and the South East, but it looks as if Network Rail want to replace it now. 

The only lines which really seem to have regular problems with overhead electrification are the East Coast main line and the Great Eastern main line.

36% of the people who showed up to vote for anyone at all, voted Conservative.

Due to the workings of the electoral system, the conservatives won 49.1% of the Parliamentary constituencies in 2010.

&gt; The Federal Reserve is controlled by stock that's held on its 12 regional banks.

&gt; **The Bank of England is the single largest stockholder** (and has been since the Fed's inception.) In fact, it was representatives from the Bank of England that set up the meeting at Jekyll Island (which saw the Federal Reserve Act drafted). Their principal agents at the meeting were J. P. Morgan Co., and Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.

&gt; Essentially, the same mob families that run the Bank of England are the very same ones who own controlling shares in the Fed. (Its monetary policy is set in the City of London, not in New York.)

&gt; ""The astounding idea that the Federal Reserve System of the United States is actually operated from London will probably be rejected at first hearing by most Americans. The 'London Connection' becomes more obvious as the dominant power when we find in The Capital City that only seventeen firms are allowed to operate as merchant bankers in the City of London, England’s financial district. All of them must be approved by the Bank of England. In fact, most of the Governors of the Bank of England come from the partners of these seventeen firms. Clarke ranks the seventeen in order of their capitalization. Number 2 is the Schroder Bank. Number 6 is Morgan Grenfell, the London branch of the House of Morgan and actually its dominant branch. Lazard Brothers is Number 8. N.M. Rothschild is Number 9. Brown Shipley Company, the London branch of Brown Brothers Harriman, is Number 14. These five merchant banking firms of London actually control the New York banks which own the controlling interest in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."" --Eustace Mullins

true,andyface,UnionFlag,'09 GSX650F,"UK motorbike licenses are pretty confusing, so I'll try and explain that for you, but depending on how old you are, there are various different routes for getting a motorbike license. I'll do my best to explain each, but mostly going off what I did when getting my full A license recently and what the school I learnt with says on the licenses, so may not be 100% correct. Not sure about what you need to do to drive in EU, but I've heard UK licenses are well respected, so may just be you need to get any one of them. Anyway, licenses:

1st step, take a bike theory test, then you can do the rest. Book through DVLA and just get it done as soon as you can, it lasts 2 years and is separate from the at theory test.

When you have passed to he theory test, you can book to do the mod1 and mod2 tests. It's a good idea to have a week or two between the mod1 and mod2 as you need to pass mod1 before you can take mod2.

Here's the more complicated bit, what license you can get and how.

17+ you can do the mod tests on a 125 which will give you an A1 license and then you can ride anything up to 125cc without L plates.

19+ you can do the mod tests on a bike up to 46.6bhp (approx 400cc apparently, though think cb500s are A2 bikes) which will give you an A2 license but limit you to lower powered bikes for 2 years. After 2 year if you're 21+ you can take a Direct Access (DAS) course to get you onto any size bike.

24+ (or 21+ if you've held an A2 for 2 years) you can do the direct access course (which is what I did) you take the mod tests on a 600cc bike which then gives you a full A license and allows you to ride anything.

If you've been riding a 125 for a while and just want to do an A1 license, then you can probably book the tests yourself and turn up and do them, however having some practise with a school will make the whole process much easier and potentially cheaper if you don't pass first time. If you want to get an A2 license or do a DAS course, then I think you have to go with a school, as they will provide you with a bike and ride with you while you practise and take you to the test centre, which you couldn't do alone.

Best thing to do would be find a school local to you, give them a ring and see what they suggest based on your age.

geton.co.uk has more info and links to local schools if you need help finding one.

Hope that helps some and hope you manage to get yourself sorted with a license soon.",0,1388874371,null,0,1388874990,0,cehez1i,t3_1uemgl,t1_cehez1i,t3_1uemgl,null,1431800411,4,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4

either the church is greedy, or some Muslims want to build a £2 mil mosque - there it is, from private backers.

it won't end well unless we get rid of the extremists and also maintain a christian aspect to life - two things which are common are the urge to discount 'celebrity' and mass-media completely - something we allow here in the uk - and be good to one another regardless of faith or lack of it - we are civilised people, what the fuck is happening to our country.

The nuke timer was also there for the comparision to the situation of the war doctor and maybe as a hint for eleventh final resolve.

true,Tipaa,uk,Bristol,"I think that non-NHS access is a non-issue, really. I did my work experience in the IT dept. of my city's hospital, and I was shown the NHS intranet and how it was used. It had no external access points, strict admin settings on user connections (e.g. on-ward PCs accessing the internet) such as cookie wiping and mime-filtering (only allowing certain filetypes through). The privileged accounts were run only by the IT 'shop' guys (worked in the hardware storehouse), who had a very strict policy on virus scanning and network connections. And then there were the server room guys, who weren't in the front-facing (interacted with doctors/nurses) IT shop (and the shop guys weren't allowed in the server access points), so there was always a layer of staff between server staff and the ward staff. This meant that it was extremely hard to get into any position of privileged data access *and* know someone that it was relevant for. They could probably look up arbitrary data by name with address, but without name-address pairs to look for (and them not having said list of names) it would just return blanks unless they got very lucky with a hit.

The on-ward access when I did the work experience used a very archaic terminal emulator. Nurses and Doctors only had access to patients on their wards (signed on to the ward by the central system), and everything was very well logged (shop guys had every non-private [like passwords, patient data fields] interaction the nurse had made in one log file we sifted looking for a hardware failure - logon times, data requests, menu selections) so you could be sure that your data was secure there too. This emulator had no copy-paste functions, couldn't be minimised without logging out, and did not run at all if a non-standard hardware configuration was present.

If the systems are like what they were when I worked a week with the IT workshop, external access is a non-issue, and someone in Aberdeen accessing your foot and crotch records is impossible if you are in a hospital in Cornwall. These gave very good safeguards against data loss and leakage, which I hope continue today and will continue with any upgrades to the systems. An upgrade was in order back when I did the work experience, and 3.5 years on I imagine the case is much the same - these different regions could do with more communication between them that is both secure and not by fax. Data ownership is a pretty solved problem within computing, so data transfer is now very safe. The only real threat to a national infrastructure for the NHS data would be political pressure to have a backdoor installed. I would like to think that the NHS is beyond spying (national institution and all that), but after seeing some company's backdoors that were assumed to be trusted, I'm not so sure anymore.

^(One company in the US ^different ^I ^know had a chip where the random number generator ^used ^in ^banking ^and ^encryption was implemented in hardware, but the RNG's gates themselves were obfuscated, and turned out to be misdirection when put under an electron microscope.

I mean the thing is it's easy to be all coy and childish about medical complaints (especially STD's etc.) but withholding the use of information just prevents others from benefiting from it. So people suffer needlessly so that others can benefit from a sense of privacy. I don't know it just seems absurd to me, but then I'm an organ donor, registered for genetic sequencing (with the knowledge that it will be public domain and anonymity isn't assured) and also for twin trials. I see it as a moral duty to do as much as possible to help, and that is more important than someone knowing about medical conditions I suffer (which in any case would be beyond my control).

I just think that privacy is only a real issue in an extremely small minority of cases, and even then it'd be much less of an issue if people just stopped acting like overgrown children, and I'm horrified that such ridiculous behaviour could prevent people from benefiting from treatments. (and cost savings _ARE_ medical benefits because the money has to come from somewhere, and every penny spent assuring some neckbeard that it's not an Orwellian state is a penny that isn't spent treating someone.)

Prove it - don't just repeat your assertion. And if your argument is based on cost, you're going to have to say what financial value you put on privacy.

&gt; I have little patience for those who value their privacy over the well-being of others.

Ok, now you're coming back to the assertion that this will benefit others as well as save costs. Again, prove it, don't just repeat your assertion. And to do this, you need to establish how you weigh privacy against medical outcome. Do you for instance advocate a total ban on smoking in the entire UK, over-riding individual choice? There would be more justification for that draconian proposal than for anything that you have said. Do you agree that everyone should have their cholesterol intake tracked with ration books? Perhaps we should ban private transport because of its high accident rate? If not, you agree that privacy and individual choice have a value which in some cases outweighs medical consequences. Now tell me on what basis you weigh the two against each other.

I think everyone here would agree with you, but the question is what those actually involved in the game are going to do about it. I'd look at Cristiano Ronaldo's time in England as an example; like Suarez, he developed a reputation for simulation early on. Before long, he shook that nasty habit (as I think Suarez slowly is, as well), and he reached a level where defenders actually did have to foul in order to stop him. Referees picked up on it, and Cristiano got the requisite protection from officials.

At the end of the day, I think the FA is smart enough to realize that the best players in the game are more valuable when healthy and playing. Besides the fact that a foul is a foul, hopefully the officials wake up and realize that Luis has hit that level where he's actually getting hacked because the other team can't stop him, and not because he's trying to earn a cheap foul.",0,1388877949,null,0,false,0,cehgk35,t3_1uejkf,t1_cehgk35,t3_1uejkf,null,1431801159,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

Not moaning at Matt Smith because the step up he's made and his contribution on the pitch has been top quality but he isn't a striker we can start week in, week out and expect him to perform, sometimes it just forces us into playing the wrong style and just lumping it up in a hope he'll do something with it.

Ross' service has dried up a lot and it seems he's either having to come too deep to collect the ball or he's out on the wings, he's much better in the box and finishing, he almost scored a wonder-goal equalizer today from outside the box, but it was his only real chance of the game and that needs to change.

Defending has been woeful for the last few weeks and after a string of clean sheets, I have no idea why. Maybe it's time to bring Warnock in for Pugh, although Pugh has exceeded expectations as he gets forward a lot, something Peltier never does (except that one time he scored/crossed for a goal- this is why he should go up).

Although Mowatt is injured, he's really the only player in midfield who has any creativity going forward, Rudy sometimes breaks through with a powerful run but sometimes runs out of ideas and lacks that creativity.

Murphy isn't justifying the money spent on him since the opening day of the season and I expected him to chip in a few more goals.

Just some of my ideas I can think of at the moment, the team is in trouble but if we spend enough on the right types of players, we're in a good enough league position that we can still make something of this season, I trust in Brian.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;Britain's decision to go to war actually was an ethical and moral choice.

how? There had been numerous cases where 'neutral' countries had been attacked and Britain hadn't defended them? If this really was a case of morality and ethics then it must be applied universally...which it wasn't. British foreign policy and the foreign policy of any nation has never been led by morality. But of course any course of action taken will be proclaimed to be the moral one. 

Germany actually demanded free passage for her troops through Belgium, promising to maintain the integrity and independence of the kingdom. Of course we should analyse the validity of this promise, but similarly we should analyse the validity of the statements made by the British government, that its role in affairs was *'an ethical and moral choice'* – we have been warned against the kind of lazy 'history' which merely relays the interests and motives of historical actors at face value. It’s no coincidence that Germany also appealed to morality, so did Serbia, so did Russia and so on.

Calling Belgium neutral is also a bit of a red herring, considering they were protected, treaty-bound, by Britain. 

&gt;If Germany had not invaded Belgium then it would have been politically impossible for Britain to declare war. The Liberal government would have been defeated by rebels in its own party and have fallen and any Tory government wouldn't have had the majority and possibly the inclination to win a vote on declaring war.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Germany support of Austria-Hungary in their dispute with Serbia has absolutely nothing to do with Germany invading Belgium

what? Germany's invasion of Belgium was **caused** by the July Crisis in the Balkans, it was the trigger.

&gt;Britain was committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the problem between Austria-Hungary, Serbia and Russia.

this is meaningless. All countries aimed at a peaceful resolution, but a resolution in which their own interests were satisfied...the same goes for Britain. It was in fact a central part of the German strategy to maintain British 'neutrality'. But Britain wasn't neutral and everyone knew it, it had its own interests to watch, its own hegemony to maintain.

&gt;Edward Grey proposed numerous times for talks to take place in order to avoid war. Each time the Germans or Austrians rejected his offer.

there are other sources a part from Grey. There were several reasons why they were rejected...first because - as Germany stated - they refused, and couldn't, call Austria-Hungary to face a 'European court', especially when it was led by their rivals Britain. Secondly, there's no evidence to suggest any country wanted European war, no doubt many of the German and A-H establishment wanted war with Serbia, but this is not the same thing as what became WW1. It's different with the benefit of hindsight. The push for war against Serbia was seen by the Germans and A-H as just another power-play, another pressure that would force their demands to be met. The A-H declaration of war was violent diplomacy, there army wasn't ready for weeks. The threat of war or 'intervention' is a diplomatic card often used to force the hand of your opponents, we see this today.

&gt;Even if Germany and Russia had gone to war over Serbia then it is extremely unlikely that Britain would have joined the conflict. As I've stated, it would be politically impossible for any party to declare war.

The Triple Entente tied any German conflict with Russia to war with Britain and France also. The whole point of the Schlieffen plan was to combat a war on two fronts, that Russian full mobilisation must be met with the capture of France after which the Germans could head east to defeat the (only-now-mobilised) Russians. As AJP Taylor put it countries were the victim of their 'railway timetables', that without direction automatic military plan kicked in caused WW1

&gt;As I've stated, it would be politically impossible for any party to declare war.

there's no such thing as political impossibility, crowds cheered the arrival of war in 1914..and even unpopularity isn't a barrier to politicians, as recent wars tell us. In fact your statement just makes Belgium seem like the necessary justification for British involvement - they needed a reason and got one. The original Schlieffen Plan had been to go through the Netherlands to invade France, if that had been the case I don’t think Britain would have stayed neutral.

It's all very well espousing radical policies out of government, but they tend to make for poor management of a country - just look at what is happening in Venezuela and Argentina (though admittedly Chile is doing a pretty spectacular job with their developments so far). Look to Obama for a northern hemisphere example - he won the election basically on the promise to cease military operations and do some further wealth redistribution, then did virtually none of that. Guantanamo prisoners have simply been off-shored to foreign countries, by and large.

I think the key thing that people don't understand right now is that the British government, under any political party, has very little room for maneuver. Politics aside, government spending has grown enormously, and so has government debt - at £51bn per annum, we spend more on interest payments than we do on education for example. The civil service has been vastly expanded in the last 20 years too.

There is no spare capacity for radical left-wing policies because they are all enormously expensive (and have no prospect of long-term economic benefit as infrastructure projects do). All there is room to do is to try and stop hemorrhaging money. If government debt were not at 85-110% GDP (depending on your metrics) then there would be room for tax-cuts or further welfare payments, depending on whichever party was in power.

Taxes are about as high as they can responsibly be - VAT is at 20%, corporation tax at 20%, the thresholds of income tax are far too low at the bottom end, and the upper end is taxed as efficiently as it can be.

We add a further £100bn debt each year, money that puts further pressure on future budgets, and yet somehow the Tories are seen as brutal oppressors who slash the state.

That is why the Lib Dems have supported the Tories - if they didn't then there would be chaos, the interest rates on govt debt would rise and the country would be in an even worse state.",0,1388882636,null,0,false,0,cehhpto,t3_1ue0lb,t1_cehhpto,t1_cehf08y,null,1435538266,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;No, he's saying that blackadder and such painted the war as a ""series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite"" (which I agree with), and that that portrayal is false. I don't know enough actual history to discuss the validity of that.

you agree with Gove but don't know enough about the history to 'prove' it? why would you agree with him then? this two statements look like a displace of cognitive dissonance

This characterisation of the war as *""series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite""* is objectively true. 

*""catastrophic mistakes""* = WW1 was a series of these, from the Gallipoli Campaign to Somme etc. In each of these cases the British lost hundreds of thousands of men often for less than a mile worth of territory. It seems to me that sending endless numbers of soldiers to run at entrenched machine gunners etc., and repeating that tactic of attrition which regularly costs the lives of thousands of soldiers an hour with little or no gain and expecting different results, makes 'catastrophic mistake' an **understatement**. Over 1 million soldiers were killed or injured in the battle of the Somme, a battle that achieved nothing, and which many generals thought would fail before it had even begun. 2 years of war had had little effect on the mind of conservative generals who still believe cavalry was a central strategy despite the self-evident realities of the war. 

*""an out-of-touch elite""* = this is a relevantly easy fact to verify, it's true. All British generals and most of the Cabinet were elites, members of the aristocracy, and came from very rich backgrounds. They were out of touch in the sense that their lives were totally different to the working-class soldiers who enlisted in 1914.

On a typical storage heater you'd have an input and output control. Input controls how much energy is put into the bricks overnight, and output controls how much heat is allowed to radiate. Generally speaking you'd set the output control to 0 at night, and turn it up during the day (or whenever you need heat). The input control is a bit more difficult, as you can't know for sure how much energy you'll need the next day, so it can take a little while to learn its quirks.

Basically, if it's going to be bastard cold the next day, crank it up a bit, otherwise turn it down. Generally speaking the heater will be set up so that the max input setting will be just enough heat to get you through a typical British winter day (so you probably don't need it on max quite yet).",0,1388887175,null,0,false,0,cehiody,t3_1uf5q0,t1_cehiody,t3_1uf5q0,null,1431802158,6,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,6

 I feel like he makes the overall plot complicated, which isn't bad, but then in the next season he tries to top himself again by making it more complicated.  And then he writes himself in a corner which he will probably just throw a paradox in to fix it.

 I also am annoyed at how the Doctor has been picking his companions.  Before, he saw something in an ordinary person and made them realize they could be great.  Now it seems like he picks his companion because something weird is happening around them.

Plus, a lot of you guys are acting like because Moffat wrote a great 50th anniversary means we can't be disappointed at the Christmas special.  You can write a great thing and a mediocre thing.  It happens.  Moffat probably gave more attention to the anniversary, and if one had to be mediocre then I'm glad it was the Christmas Special.

With regards to my personal opinion of the episode, though, their costumes were no worse than the American TV Westerns of the era, so I didn't fault them for that. I've only seen a few minutes of it, and kept picking up bits of Brit accent mingling with the American, so I felt those could have been done better if they'd had more time/budget to help the cast with it. (or maybe I was too harsh. It was a long time ago, and it's a fuzzy memory)

The simple, genuine truth is that the viewers at the time seem to have simply not enjoyed the story much. At the time, the audience for the show either wasn't in the mood for Yet Another American Western, or simply didn't take to it. Not to say it was badly written, it was just not something that appealed.

The only reference to speed data I've seen is from coaches, so no I don't think there's anything publicly available.

There's an insane amount of data collected about every player during every match which the coaches analyse.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"The Sixth Doctor's final companion was Mel Bush, a personal fitness trainer. She was concerned that he was a little generous in the waistline, shall we say, so she put him on an exercise regimen and a diet - the latter of which included carrot juice, of which he was not fond.

In the Sixth Doctor's final televised adventure, the last bit of dialog between him and Mel was her saying something about carrot juice, and him incredulously repeating ""Carrot juice?!"" as the TARDIS dematerialized.

Behind the scenes, it was decided that the poor ratings and reviews of the show meant that Colin Baker (the Doctor) would have to be the fall guy. To date, he's the only actor dismissed from the role. 

That didn't stop the BBC from asking Baker to return, to film the regeneration sequence that would write his Doctor out of the show. 

Baker's reply rhymed with ""Puck off"". 

Baker's absence meant that the production team were very limited in what they could do to show the Doctor regenerating into his newer form. So, the Seventh Doctor's first adventure started with the new Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) dressed in his predecessor's unique coat and wearing a wig, so as to pass off as Colin Baker if you weren't looking too closely (and in 1987, *no one* was looking too closely). The story had him take a bump on his head and fall face down on the floor of the TARDIS. When his body was turned over, the regeneration effect was already in progress, obscuring his face.

[It's the worst regeneration of all time.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_OT2obe710)

EDIT: When the 11th Doctor made his debut in 2010, one of the foods he rejected was carrots, possibly hearkening back to his dislike of carrot juice in his sixth form.

Read this: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42 - skip to section 13 first.

You would have committed the following offences:

~~Section 15: Meeting a child following sexual grooming etc. (5 years).~~ double checked, minors cannot groom each other.

 

&gt;Section 14: Arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence. (5 years).

&gt;Section 10: Causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. (5 years).

&gt;Section 9: Sexual activity with a child. (5 years).

Now its unlikely you'd be charged with any or all of those, and even if you were you would be unlikely to receive the maximum 5 years. (and I'm assuming that you're not 18 or over, because if you are those 5s become 14s). So possibly ~~20~~ 15 years in prison, with good behaviour you'd get out in 2022.

Now if you glance at section 72 you'll see that the same applies even if you go over there.

I'm hoping that you've not sent or received any naughty pictures, because that would be an offense (or more precisely a number of offenses, one for each image) too.

true,staptiudupe,null,null,"The thing that fucked this squad was the fact that we missed out on Gary Hooper in the summer window. Harry's original plan had him and Austin forming the core of the attack which would also be able to keep us afloat in the premiership. 

Thing is, the back line (as you pointed out) is keeping us going. My preference would be to have a mean defense to rely on. Once a system is in place it keeps itself going (and also, in most other sports, it is defense, which wins you big games etc). It then enables us to 'win' ugly, and personally, if we do get points on the board, I'm happy. It doesn't make for a great final product for the fans (at times like today), but being in the top 3 is a great place, especially after the cluster fuck of last season.  

Harry (IMO) had a fundamental change in the way he thinks about football after being fired by Tottenham and when he was thinking about managing England (the whole thing about bringing in Brendan Rodgers and playing a different style).  He has switched to possession based football and packing the midfield, which seems to be the style much more on the continent than it is at home, with that emphasis on one striker rather than 2. Again, had we had Hooper, we may be playing two up front, with a packed midfield/mix of wingers with Barton and another playmaker in the middle of the park. Either way, he wants us keeping the ball rather than handing an initiative to the opposing team (in theory). So far it has panned out at times, but has seen us struggle at other moments, the Championship is much more a slug fest than the Prem, that is what we need to keep in mind. I think the plan was to implement the system this season, with an eye on it being ready for when we're promoted (and I think that the higher ups will be hedging their bets on us going up this season), but we've lacked that second striker/other winger to finish the opportunities we create (Hoilett seems to have a hamstring made of glass). 

Long story short, I think Harry is in the process of trying to implement a new system, while having to integrate a fair number of players. We've done a good job so far of shipping dead weight (though some still remains) and if TF is as keen as he appears, if we add a striker of Jelavic's caliber (hoping the fact that Kranjcar is getting time with Croatia working in our favour!) then we should be find for the rest of this season, baring some minor tweaks (such as a replacement for Carroll if he leaves). I'm still hoping for an automatic spot, as I think out defense will outlast Burnley's strikers and Derby's form as well. 

Anyway, apologies for this wall of text, it's just that I've spent a lot of time thinking about how management, to me, appears to have been trying to think one step ahead this term in terms of strategy rather than looking for quick fixes, which means that we're still in a period where the squad and system are getting used to one another. 

Again, if I'm talking utter shite, then please tell me! 

TL:DR: Striker such as Jelavic and possible replacement for Carroll and we should be good, New System and new way of thinking means this season is a growing period.

Do you mean, it doesn't impact you?

We're asking our young people to take on £9,000 a year University fees on top of maintenance loans. A standard graduate degree could set back a young person roughly £37,5000 before they've started work, for education which the older generation - for the most part - got for free. That doesn't seem very fair.

But let's look a little deeper - 

By your own admission, it has had little effect on admissions rates. Is this because young people don't mind or does that fact demonstrate that young people are in a world where they feel like they have to get a degree just to be able to get a job? Be honest, how much is getting a degree a matter of choice now and how much of it is a necessity in the young people's working world?

Well, I say job but in reality a lot of young people will take all of those loans to then be told that 'they need experience too' and guess what? Working in their holidays isn't what they mean. Now businesses want them to work for free or on minimum wage as an intern. Doesn't seem fair either.

No problem, they can drag themselves through that and land themselves a job and begin renting.

They have to rent because, for starters, they probably just spent their savings on that internship so they definitely don't have money for a deposit, but, nevertheless, they can't afford to buy anyway because house prices are going up and up because so many properties are being bought up as 'buy to let' by those who can already use the property they've bought some years ago as collateral. So whilst one generation is going further into debt, the other is manipulating the system to get richer. Still doesn't seem fair.  

But that's not anybody else's problem, right? Except, we seem to have forgotten that young people are our future. So if their future is bleak, is ours?

Well, the massive debts they have and their inability to land themselves on the housing market will probably mean that we are, obviously, a debt ridden society, which in turn can reduce our overall consumption capabilities which, and i'm sure you'll agree, won't be nice for anybody.

There's also that issue of when the land owning generation want to sell off their properties in 10 - 15 years time so they can retire, they'll find that  they've been milking the cows dry and now there's nothing left to make the pudding with. Without the necessary finance from the younger generation to buy up the houses, and the sudden influx of houses onto the market, house prices will tumble and the assets so many people had planned to retire on have lost their value which, with an ageing population and spiralling welfare bills as it is, will land us in a bit of a pickle. 

So let's be clear, it does impact them - a great deal. Any notion that landing a 21 year old with almost 40k of debt does not affect them at all is, quite frankly, ridiculous.

It will also impact everybody else in 10-15 years time too.

And you know what, even if it didn't in some way spin back and kick us in the ass, maybe it should just be enough that it's unfair that we have consistently paid for people's university education for decades and then, in a relatively short space of time, the generation who had it paid for them, decided not to do the same for their children. 

Let's also not forget that Universities spend a huge amount of time doing research which benefits society, not students. We've forced students to entirely finance something which supports us all.

true,vicvonshroom,null,null,"I think we'll end up agreeing to disagree here. However of the episodes you mentioned I find that like 2 of them I actually cared about the emotional investment that Moffat created. I'll give you the doctors wife and the girl who waited. The angels take manhatten was too convoluted for me to feel any real emotion in it. 

RTD's era is filled with a lot of emotional moments not just specific emotional episodes. HE took the characters and their emotions seriously whereas I've felt that Moffat doesn't tend to do that often because it would take away from his not careful plotting. Moffat tends to write himself into corners as why it took a good long while to find out why the tardis exploded and such. Donna also while kind of a mystery, her mystery was introduced her very last episode while Clara and Amy(her pregnancy which I feel was a bonkers storyline to me) both became plot devices that led to future stories rather than people who help the doctor super often. LIke I've said before I'm sure they'll get around to developing Clara later maybe. I don't feel they did properly with Amy. She barely ever suffered any consequences for her actions. She basically forcefully kissed the doctor and it came back up really or ever really effected her later on but with Rose that was a definite issue and it made her character realize what she wanted whereas Amy was never really chastised or anything for it. 

Like I said, we'll end up just agreeing to disagree and because I think River is the worst character in 11's run. She went from cool and smart to a cheesy ridiculous and for me boring and uninteresting character. I loved how they played with their timelines but felt that could have been any number of other acquaintances the doctor might have known and it would have been a stronger overall run for it. 

I'll summarize my problems with Moffat and RTD like this: 

I feel Moffat spends way too much time on his plots and not enough to develop his characters properly whereas I feel that RTD was better as developing characters and building up suspense very well but ultimately failed on the delivery of his build ups. I've never really felt like any of Moffats arcs were that particularly satisfying with the exception of his more standalone arcs(The angels episodes being particular standouts). I think that Moffat also suffers from having his companions around too long where RTD had them stay a good while so you can know and grow to care about them but then have them leave whereas aside season 1 Amy(except the whole thing where she likes the doctor while in her characters arc still was a bit lame duck to me) and Rory, I never felt like I cared about his companions ever just the doctor. Matt Smith is one hell of a doctor but I feel he could have had an amazing instead of an alright run if they hadn't focused so much on the plots and allowed more characters to join him rather than keeping Amy and Rory for as long as they did.",0,1388897886,null,0,false,0,cehna46,t3_1ue9az,t1_cehna46,t1_cehf72f,null,1431804474,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Mokoba,null,null,"&gt; what? Germany's invasion of Belgium was caused by the July Crisis in the Balkans, it was the trigger.

Germany used the escalating conflict in the Balkans, that it had the power to stop but didn't, to execute the Schleffien plan. It knew that France would be dragged into the the war because of it's treaties with Russia when Germany declared war on Russia in support of Austria-Hungary.

&gt; this is meaningless. All countries aimed at a peaceful resolution, but a resolution in which their own interests were satisfied...the same goes for Britain. It was in fact a central part of the German strategy to maintain British 'neutrality'. But Britain wasn't neutral and everyone knew it, it had its own interests to watch, its own hegemony to maintain.

In what sense is it meaningless? It is rather obvious that neither Germany or Austria-Hungary had any interest in negotiating a peaceful outcome. The demands of Austria-Hungary were minor compared to the ramifications of a European war, Grey had shown in 1913 with the Treaty of London that it was possible for a peaceful outcome when it came to Balkan issues.

&gt; there are other sources a part from Grey. There were several reasons why they were rejected...first because - as Germany stated - they refused, and couldn't, call Austria-Hungary to face a 'European court', especially when it was led by their rivals Britain. Secondly, there's no evidence to suggest any country wanted European war, no doubt many of the German and A-H establishment wanted war with Serbia, but this is not the same thing as what became WW1. It's different with the benefit of hindsight. The push for war against Serbia was seen by the Germans and A-H as just another power-play, another pressure that would force their demands to be met. The A-H declaration of war was violent diplomacy, there army wasn't ready for weeks. The threat of war or 'intervention' is a diplomatic card often used to force the hand of your opponents, we see this today

Revisionist bunkum. Grey offered numerous diplomatic solutions, even the chance to resolve any disputes using the Court of Arbitration in neutral Netherlands was rejected. It's a struggle to think of anything more that Grey could have done to avoid war when Germany and Austria-Hungary rejected diplomatic offers that could have resolved the crisis.

&gt; The Triple Entente tied any German conflict with Russia to war with Britain and France also. The whole point of the Schlieffen plan was to combat a war on two fronts, that Russian full mobilisation must be met with the capture of France after which the Germans could head east to defeat the (only-now-mobilised) Russians. As AJP Taylor put it countries were the victim of their 'railway timetables', that without direction automatic military plan kicked in caused WW1

Britain had no obligation to join the war, the Triple Entente was meant as a deterrent to direct aggression by the Central Powers. 

Germany knew that if Russia entered the war then France, who had a different set of treaties with Russia, would also enter the war. Germany had the power to rein in Austria-Hungary but they didn't, they allowed them to continue knowing exactly what would happen if they did.

&gt; there's no such thing as political impossibility, crowds cheered the arrival of war in 1914..and even unpopularity isn't a barrier to politicians, as recent wars tell us. In fact your statement just makes Belgium seem like the necessary justification for British involvement - they needed a reason and got one. The original Schlieffen Plan had been to go through the Netherlands to invade France, if that had been the case I don’t think Britain would have stayed neutral.

There is such a thing as a political impossibility when there aren't enough MP's in the House to support the declaration of war, also the small issue of public sentiment being against war.

The Liberal government had no inclination whatsoever to declare war, it went against the very principles of the party. Gladstone and his ideals were still core to the party and its supporters. The German violation of treaties and Belgian neutrality is the only reason they would ever be in favour of war.

Crowds cheered the arrival of war because of the circumstances of it's outbreak. No one foresaw Germany breeching Belgian neutrality, it was almost inconceivable that Germany would not only do something that breeched International Law but would also drag Britain into the war.

The Schlieffen plan was hardly public knowledge, it was a secret invasion plan and it called for invasion through **both** the Netherlands and Belgium.

true,Mokoba,null,null,"&gt; how? There had been numerous cases where 'neutral' countries had been attacked and Britain hadn't defended them? If this really was a case of morality and ethics then it must be applied universally...which it wasn't. British foreign policy and the foreign policy of any nation has never been led by morality. But of course any course of action taken will be proclaimed to be the moral one.

Care to share any examples of a country that Britain had a treaty guaranteeing a country's neutrality and sovereignty but failed to uphold the treaty?

&gt; Germany actually demanded free passage for her troops through Belgium, promising to maintain the integrity and independence of the kingdom. Of course we should analyse the validity of this promise, but similarly we should analyse the validity of the statements made by the British government, that its role in affairs was 'an ethical and moral choice' – we have been warned against the kind of lazy 'history' which merely relays the interests and motives of historical actors at face value. It’s no coincidence that Germany also appealed to morality, so did Serbia, so did Russia and so on.
Calling Belgium neutral is also a bit of a red herring, considering they were protected, treaty-bound, by Britain.

You don't seem to understand the concept of neutrality and the treaty that guaranteed it. 

A neutral country cannot be involved in a conflict, no matter what. Even the German demand for passage of it's troops through Belgium, no matter what promises they made, was a direct violation of this neutrality. 

Britain was treaty bound to guarantee it's neutrality and independence but they were not the only signatories to the treaty. Britain, France, Austria, Germany and Russia were all signatories. In what possible way is that a red herring? 

&gt; sounds almost like 'we' needed Belgium to refuse German passage, hence sparking a war, to justify our own involvement??

There was no need, you seem to think that Britain wanted to declare war. Belgium had every right to refuse Germany passage.

Windsor is popular and pretty. Canterbury is worth a day (but probably not more than a day). York the same. The Lake District is unbelievably beautiful - it's worth a week or more. Hell, it's worth a lifetime, but really, it's stunning and well worth a look.

Bits of Hadrian's wall are in good condition and worth a couple of hours.

Brighton is a fun night out or weekend.

Dorset (Purbeck) is lovely.

Oxford is cool. Visit the Sheldonian, the Pitt Rivers Museum, have a drink in the Turf, a pie from that place in the covered market, mooch around the colleges, a solid and very English meal in Browns.

Bletchley Park is where the computer was invented and where the war was won (well to be precise, British intelligence, Soviet blood, American steel). But yeah, Bletchley Park is a good day out.

Henley on Thames, Marlowe, Hambleden - English country towns villages and pubs.

Best places to eat in Britain are the Sofitel St James' and Gordon Ramsay's place, both in London, and a couple of places in Bray - including the Duck. Having said that, if you're in London there are superb Chinese restaurants (surprisingly, in Chinatown), and some amazingly good Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi places in Brick Lane and all across London.

Stonehenge is quite disappointing - drab visitor's centre, fences, fees etc. Instead, check out Avebury - a stone circle thousands of years old that's so large there's a village built in it (and a reasonable pub). No visitors fee, you can literally climb up and sit on the stones (which are approximately the same date as the Pyramids, i.e. 2600BC).

The storage heaters help a lot, but if you have an electric shower, you need to be using that only during the E7 hours, and set your water heater on a timer also.

If possible, make meals and have them in the cooker on a timer so they are cooked overnight / early morning on the low tariff too. 
You also need to do all your washing during low rate hours.


It's also worth buying some timer plugs so you can turn appliances that charge up only during those hours.

Older storage heaters are pretty crap, and will usually be out of charge by late evening, but you can use this to your advantage - get a heated mattress topper thing or electric blanket and have early nights.
You can then get up early and do stuff both to make full use of cheap electric, but also enjoy the heat for a bit.

First off, experiment with your storage heaters to get used to them before it gets too cold. It's also worth getting a cheap fan heater for if you guess wrong so you don't freeze!

Shut doors! That's my no1 tip. Compartmentalize your house/flat and set the heaters to match - the living room ones need a good charge, hallways can be set low. Get draught excluders, and if it gets mega cold you can retreat to the living room or bedroom and heat that with a fan heater.

There are lots of other schools in the area too such as Berkeley so there's a lot of diversity as far as student population.

As far as winter compared to south England, well i've never been to south England but it can be pretty harsh in New England.

That make the mortgage payments £375 a month and leaves a monthly take home of £1150.

I wouldn't go in for it myself.

But in this theoretical scenario it is probably cheaper than, or comparable to, renting an apartment and your stand to gain should the property increase in price over time.

As time goes on, OP could then make mortgage overpayments as his income increases and start paying down the principal amount of the mortgage.

Look at their actions on the international stage, escalating tensions in Morocco in the various Morocco crises. Look at them explicitly giving Austro-Hungary a carte-blanche to invade Serbia and Russia, and then repeatedly refusing British offers to mediate the issues peacefully. 

They were not ""no different from the British"". They were systematically more aggressive than the British, who were the ones that managed to de-escalate the Morocco crises. Even in the run up to the war about half the British cabinet was opposed to going to war. You will find no such governmental opposition in Germany.

true,Mordisquitos,null,null,"Talking about queues at airports, am I the only one who finds the queue layout the UK Border Agency uses illogical?

+ EU/EEA passports only
+ Other passports only

Checking an EU/EEA passport or ID card basically entails verifying it is not fake and (maybe) checking if it's a wanted person and then waving people through, which means the ""Other"" passports queue could handle it just as well. Also, more importantly, the whole point of being an EU/EEA citizen at an EU border is the convenience of just being waved through, but when a plane chock-full of EU/EEA citizens arrives we all queue like idiots on the EU/EEA queue while the Border Agents in the ""Other"" queue sit there twidling their thumbs. And if there were a small number of non-EU citizens on that flight, they will get treated to a handy little express queue while all the UK and other EU/EEA citizens wait for ages.

It's much more logical if the queues are laid out like in Spain:

+ EU/EEA passports only
+ Any passport

That way, EU/EEA citizens are never at a time disadvantage with regards to ""Others"". If it's a large number of EU/EEA citizens are trying to get through, they will spread out amongst all queues and get through quicker, and ""Others"" will have to wait (on average) exactly the same as EU/EEA citizens to get to the ""Any passport"" agents. If instead it's a large number of non-EU/EEA citizens, EU/EEA citizens will still be able to enjoy their privilege and take the less crowded EU/EEA queue.",0,1388918928,null,0,false,0,cehspqs,t3_1uesby,t1_cehspqs,t3_1uesby,null,1431807040,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

The solution for websites affected by this isn't simple, but it is possible. Unfortunately it will involve either the cooperation of major browsers, and/or a popular and widespread browser plugin. This plugin would ultimately be responsible for;

- DNS checking; when the system DNS returns a different result to a trusted DNS, pick the trusted one
- IP checking; when an ISP blocks access via IP, lookup if site is hosted at other IPs and choose those (staying behind places like AWS, Cloudfare and Akami help here)

Why not both?
This was a horrible overall story, with plot holes, an annoying child ally, and Clara, The Doctor's main companion, in her second official appearance as such, offers little more than being a 'yes' woman.  
(Hell Rose was questioning the psycho she was travelling with by her second episode...but again, she was about to be fried by a Sun as well...)

But.......but the dialogue, specifically of The Doctor, and the sets/effects were wonderful.  Add Matt Smith's performance and gripping madness during the now legendary speech, and it's well worth your 50 minute watch.  I'd even say it's a must watch, if you ever want to get into the head of 11 and how he feels about the memories of his losses, and how he still values life.  Only 'A Town Called Mercy' and 'The Beast Below' come close to showing the extremes 11 will go to when protecting life.

If they had given a different reason why the child needed to be sacrificed, and given Clara some of the sassy attitude that we now know her for, and made the 'monster of the week' something a little more 'monstery' and less god-like, I'd think of it as nothing short of amazing.

&gt; Approximately 90 per cent of people who die by suicide have a diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health problem at the time of death.

&gt; Over-simplification of the causes or perceived ‘triggers’ for a suicide can be misleading and is unlikely to reflect accurately the complexity of suicide.

&gt; For example, avoid the suggestion that a single incident, such as loss of a job, relationship breakdown or bereavement, was the cause.

To me it is like being abducted by psychos and being asked to decide which similar sized objects get forced up my arse with no lube.

I am bitter and angry, I have tried to seek help from professionals on numerous occasions and our mental health service is beyond a joke.

We are living in a dream world, our hunter gather brains cannot compute that we have more than enough. Our bodies are confused by fatty and sugary foods and internet porn because we still have hunter gatherer instincts, our brains have not come to terms with the fact that we now live in a world of abundance.

If we built loads of cheap housing and made utilities public again, people would have so much spare money that the economy would be fixed. However stupid old people love the status quo because they got theirs.
Old people like that their house is worth 10 times what they paid for them even though most of them will never move out, so it makes no difference. Meanwhile young people cant afford houses so we will remain wage slaves and old people freeze to death in their own homes.

I refuse to have children unless I learn a trade and make more than 50k a year. However I am too depressed to even bother.

People working 40 hours plus a week is a joke. We privatize the profits and socialize the losses. If we could socialize the profits we could all afford to work less and focus on scientific and sociological advancement. We are living in a financial dark age and it makes me sick to my stomach that people can't see this.

When I voted I spoiled my vote, maybe a campaign to get young people to go to the polling offices to spoil their vote would be a good idea?

You need to be responsible for your own repairs and it's much more of a commitment, but on the flip side you can do all the changes and decorating you like. It's a much longer term commitment though, so you have to be 100% sure.

With renting, the prices are dictated by market competition and property values. With owning, your outgoings are set by the interest base rate although you can obviously fix your mortgage.

If you have a decent deposit, I'd seriously look at what you could buy to suit your needs - I doubt you'd lose any money on it as values are starting to stabilise/climb again but it really is a very personal decision.",0,1388920864,null,0,false,0,cehszv5,t3_1ugddc,t1_cehszv5,t3_1ugddc,null,1431807186,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10
