i don't know if you're being intentionally dense but ""freedom of speech"" in modern interpretations is exactly the same as freedom of expression. 

if you think having caveats in free speech/expression means that freedom of expression doesn't exist, then why the fuck would you want it to exist? Without caveats against misuse, there is no such thing as doctor-patient confidentiality,  there would be no legal way of acting against people who publish lists of informants or undercover agents, nothing illegal about standing on a soap box every day and asking people to burn down a man's house. if having all those is the only way to have freedom of expression in your eyes, then I have no idea why anyone would want that.

I dare say there would have been a catastrophe if they were not (although back to the dark ages is a bit of an exaggeration), but the simple fact they needed such support, after a very profitable boom period, is testament to their focus on short-term profit and unsustainability. 

What I take issue with is the fact that they have been allowed to carry on pretty much as normal, even though in the wake of the bailouts the banks were found guilty of rigging [LIBOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal), [Exchange Rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scandal) and [commodity prices](http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/11/19/goldman-morgan-stanley-and-jp-morgan-named-in-commodity-manipulation-investigation/). These institutions were making pots of cash engaging in blatant criminal activity, crashed the economy and got bailed out by taxpayers and you expect me not to be outraged?

The fallout is clear to see, with most wages stagnating, public services decimated and then we get this news that bonuses are at a record high!

And let's not forget, banks are still being propped up by near-zero interest rates, ultra-accommodating central banks and implicit taxpayer backstopping.

The player outs aren't bad at all. Except for Gerrard. There is simply no way that the club *actively* moves Gerrard mostly because it would be a public relations nightmare. Winning cures *a lot* of ills and Chelsea were able to part with a legend like Frank Lampard because they could still easily win without him (and have done so). Perhaps Gerrard isn't suited for the Premier League anymore, however, as long as we're not winning, then every time we struggle there'll be shouts of ""We needed a Gerrard in that match.""

As for the transfer committee, I think a lot of clubs work with some sort of committee in one way or another. It's just that our committee and its structure has been highly publicised. I'm fine with the committee.

As for Pascoe and Rodgers... it's easy to want to replace assistants and managers like we're playing Fantasy Premier League, however, there's much more than that. Pascoe and Rodgers likely spend an inordinate amount of hours together during the season and there's the simple fact that you have to *like* the person you're spending that much time with. Pascoe was hand-picked by Rodgers and only Rodgers will be the one to replace Pascoe.

If ownership fired Pascoe, then that undermines Rodgers' authority and alienates Rodgers so you may as well sack Rodgers as well.

So, then it comes to Rodgers... do you sack Rodgers?

Well, that is the big question... is Rodgers failing because of his transfers and his coaching? Or is Rodgers failing because he lost two players who were the top goal scorers in the league last season?

As frustrating as it might be, Rodgers needs more time.

I would only sack Rodgers if he lost the dressing room but it seems to me that the squad has a great respect for Rodgers and for FSG to sack Rodgers is a big risk because of the instability you create amongst the players. A new manager means new philosophies, a new style, new tactics, new/unfamiliar training methods. A new manager would certainly mean that he would intend to build a squad in his own unique vision and that might mean players we only just recently signed could be sent packing. And then it's another cycle of, ""Give the New Manager more time as he is undoing what Rodgers has done.""

I don't necessarily think it's the lack of quality players or management or transfer decisions that is hurting us... I really think it's as simple as: We don't have a clear goal-scoring threat.

I think the return of a fully fit Sturridge will help immensely.

As for January, I think we simply need to do whatever it takes to get the best striker available to not only help Sturridge but be able to have the confidence and ability to shoulder the burden of goal-scoring when/if Sturridge is injured.

Ultimately, as frustrating as this season has been, I think we're much closer to long-term success than we think. But we have to accept that this success won't happen immediately (i.e. this season).",0,1419325475,null,0,false,0,cn34uf8,t3_2q4a7q,t1_cn34uf8,t3_2q4a7q,null,1425256887,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The Thals explain that they were once warriors and the Daleks (back when they looked humanoid) were great scientists. The war between them changed all that.

He could move to a country with nice weather and a league that suits his pace and he wouldn't have to deal with opposing fans and the media. I think he puts too much pressure on himself to actively be the match winner and its really not helping the team anymore. Yeah you're right about the fan reaction though, people would say ""Gerrard would have won us that game"" in reality when a 27 year old Gerrard might have but not the current Gerrard. 

Yeah I think the Transfer Committee are okay but it just seems to be creating a blame game currently, Rodgers does need help in the transfer window though, maybe a DOF would help him.

As with Pascoe I agree he won't be sacked while Brendan is managing I just think it may be beneficial if he had someone with more experience than him as his right hand man.

&gt;So, then it comes to Rodgers... do you sack Rodgers?

&gt;Well, that is the big question... is Rodgers failing because of his transfers and his coaching? Or is Rodgers failing because he lost two players who were the top goal scorers in the league last season?

Could it be a mix of transfers, coaching and the lack of strikers as to why Rodgers isn't managing the team too well at the moment? I'm completely unsure whether he should still be manager or not but the dressing room is vital. If we don't make CL will players that signed for us to specifically play CL Football want to leave?

Lets just hope we get Sturridge firing, and for some insane reason I still believe in Balotelli and think he should be partnered with Sterling as a strike partner for the time being, but would have no problems with a new striker being signed. Cheers for reading and replying anyway mate :)

**By Janan Ganesh**

A mere opinion poll that came out last week must count as one of the political moments of the year in Britain. It did not gauge anything as tangible as voting intention, the popularity of the party leaders or their perceived economic competence. Instead, respondents were asked by ComRes to put the parties on an ideological scale, running from 1 (leftwing) to 10 (rightwing).
According to Britons, the most extreme party of any note are the governing Conservatives. With a score of 6.9, they are seen to languish farther from the centre ground than a Labour party fronted by “Red” Ed Miliband, the most avowedly leftist leader of the opposition for a generation.


The Tories are more right wing than the grouchy populists of the UK Independence party. The anti-austerity, anti-nuclear, anti-fracking Greens, who would renationalise the railways and stamp out independent schools within the state sector, are nearer the centre than the Conservative party. So is the celebrity anarchist Russell Brand and the Prince of Wales, whose grievances with modernity seem to begin with the Industrial Revolution.


For any Conservative who favours power over doctrinal purity, and there are still some, this data should chill the blood. Their party has not profited very much from Labour’s entirely predictable seepage of support this year, and the ComRes finding helps to explain why. People rate the Tories as stewards of the economy and David Cameron as prime minister, but there are three variables that shape a party’s electoral prospects, not two. As well as leadership and economic trust there is the airier question of a party’s reputation or brand. The Conservatives’ brand is still so foul as to nullify their strapping advantage on the other two variables.


At some indistinct point in the 1990s a nebulous view of the Tories as sour, hard-faced people calcified in the public mind. The party’s failure to do much about this since then, beyond the three-year stab at “modernisation” with which Mr Cameron began his leadership, is a corporate failure as deserving of study as the decline of Nokia and Kodak. Complacency, slowness to innovate, estrangement from modern citizens and their evolving habits: it is the same kind of story.


The most dangerous sickness is one you do not know you have. Conservatives do not know they have a reputational problem any more. Or at least they have ceased to talk about it. Modernisation, which lifted the party to 50 points in the polls by 2008, has become something to be lived down and remembered with a wince, like a bacchanalian night out. Mr Cameron himself hardly mentions it. Meanwhile, unreconstructed rightwingery has never been more influential in the party since it drove the Tories into the ground in the 2001 and 2005 elections.
The party has become a Bizarro World in which vote-losing rightwingers strut around like doctors who have reclaimed the asylum from its lunatics, while modernisers responsible for the Tories’ one brush with popularity in the past quarter of a century sit cowering in the corner.


Mr Cameron’s leadership, now in its 10th year, began with psephological insights that have lost none of their wisdom or relevance. They just seem to have lost his fealty.
What are these insights? Three stand out. A popular policy can lose votes if it confirms suspicions about the party presenting it. When too many policies of a similar ideological type are combined, voters hear the chord rather than the individual notes, and it jars. Above all, superficialities matter. If a party does not radiate moderation and good intentions, nothing it says will get a fair hearing, however sane or well thought through.


It is extravagant nonsense to suppose that Ukip or the Greens really are more centrist than the Conservatives. But it is the Conservatives’ fault that this impression exists. They have had years to shake hostile perceptions of themselves by doing counter-intuitive things. When they tried it, they soared. At the end of it all, however, they are going into yet another general election on a narrow platform of fiscal tightness, euroscepticism and anti-immigration. If anything saves them, it will be Labour’s own terror of venturing outside its ideological comfort zone. This election is an unpopularity contest between two parties talking to themselves.


At this point, it is customary to advise a course of action. But the election is five months away and Mr Cameron will not change his pitch to voters. There is too much pressure on him from Tories convinced of the wide appeal of their ideological hobby horses. And they are right: getting tough on Europe, welfare and migration is popular. Chocolate is popular, too, but eating it to the exclusion of all else makes people queasy.

The enthusiasm with which my grandmother's generation embraced the existence of the state of Israel was easy to understand considering the traumatic events that unfolded for them during Ze Vaar but the way this blind worship of a genocidal project has permeated three or four following generations is really quite depressing. 

I suppose this is as much related to the amazing capacity for culture to cultivate stupidity over all other potential human traits. 

Why is this arsehole working in Jerusalem, has he not heard of the BDS movement? Why does the journalist who wrote this article quote someone from the Board Of Deputies without at least pointing out it is a rabidly conservative organisation which does a lot to support the vile regime in occupied Palestine? 

Where is the information about growing antisemitism? Dramatic incidents that emerge due to frustration or anger about Israeli war crimes do not indicate a trend. They don't necessarily even constitute antisemitism except in a very superficial way. The Jewish state of Israel with its Jewish symbology, discrimination against all non Jews, Apartheid, genocide against the land's inhabitants, the automatic citizenship of all the Jews of the world and so on goes out of its way to advertise its Jewishness. It's not surprising some people react by thinking - bunch of Jewish cunts. 

Danny Cohen is a member of the privileged elite feeling entitled to have a moan because there is some tiny reaction in our society against Israel and a tiny proportion of that is expressed in antisemitic form.

The 'factored-in the rent of the flat' wording in the council tax section could be misunderstood to mean that the council tax is included in the rent paid to the landlord.

Insurance: You'll need your own insurance to cover your possessions in the flat, called 'contents insurance'. Expect to pay around £10 per month. The landlord will insure the building and their fixtures, fittings and furniture themselves.

Most letting agents will perform inspections during your tenancy. How often varies. 

Furnished properties outnumber unfurnished properties 10-1. Unfurnished usually includes a cooker, fridge and washing machine. Dishwashers are rare in all properties - you're lucky if you get one.

Check your contract terms. Usually after 6 months you go into a rolling contract and can just give notice, but some agents will have different terms or will issue a new contract. Almost all will negotiate those terms, so ask if you have specific requirements. 

Probably worth explaining why heating is such a large expense: as well as being a cold part of the world, Edinburgh flats are old and draughty, often with single glazed windows and no insulation. You'll want to invest in a pair of slippers.

If you're in a good area, basement flats are fine, just watch out for damp. You might want to invest in a dehumidifier if you're staying for a while. 

For the mobile section, I would add that all of the mobile networks have good coverage in Edinburgh and none of them are a total rip off, so don't worry too much about which one to choose, you can find the best deal for you later. (Also, is giffgaff available in shops?) Also, mobile broadband is generally pretty good and may be a suitable replacement for fixed line services, particularly if you are here for less than a year. 

Lothian buses have their own mobile app now. Also worth adding that you can't use a Lothian bus pass on other companies busses, such as First. This sometimes trips up newcomers who are expecting an integrated system.

I would add to the transport section that unless you have a specific need for it, don't hire a car at the airport thinking you'll be able to use it to look at properties. You'll spend more time finding somewhere to park than driving it. Same applies to buying your own, especially if you are living and/or working centrally. 

The advice about smoking feels irresponsible. Cigarette smoke builds up quickly and regular smoking in a property will be instantly noticeable during inspections.

Probably worth being clear about why August is so busy: Edinburgh holds a massive festival where the population doubles for a month (we often get people unaware of this). Do not try to move to Edinburgh in August. One bed flats go very quickly in September as they are snapped up by wealthier students. 

If you are overseas, don't expect letting agents to show any interest in you. They are inundated with emails and phone calls from overseas students and visitors and the rental market here moves fast. Once you are here and able to view properties, they will be more help. 

Bear in mind when dealing with agents that you are not the customer. ""I have money to spend and they are not interested"" is commonly heard in this sub, but the agent's customer is the owner of the property. The agent doesn't make any money from you (at least they don't if they are following the law).

Every agent you speak to, tell them what you are looking for and ask them to call you if something becomes available. They may not, but it is worth asking. If you have a UK mobile number, you're more likely to get a call back. If not, give your number as it needs to be dialled in the UK. Don't leave it to the agent to work out what your country code is, because they won't bother.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city

In the modern era when we're all so interconnected that state boundaries are less important today than city connectivity e.g. their integration into the world economy.

So the world becomes one massive 'hub and spoke' network of cities, with alpha cities being a major node for not just their country but also their continent. New York attracts trade and investment from all over North America, as does London from all over Europe.

From their listing of 'world' cities we have;

1. London (1/12 - Major Global)
2. Manchester (6/12 - Moderate Regional)
2. Birmingham (7/12 - Moderate Regional)
4. Edinburgh (7/12)
5. Bristol (8/12 - Minor regional)
6. Glasgow (9/12 - Minor regional)
7. Leeds (9/12)
8. Belfast (9/12)
9. Southampton (11/12 - High Self Sufficiency)
10. Newcastle (11/12)
11. Liverpool (12/12 - Self sufficient)
12. Cardiff (12/12)
13. Aberdeen (12/12)
14. Sheffield (12/12)
15. Nottingham (12/12)

and anything below class 12 is not considered self-sufficient in the global economy. The biggest gap there is obviously the gap between London and the rest, we have no moderate or minor global cities, the next level we have Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh, economically, are there to link the regions (the midlands, the north west and Scotland respectively) to London, essentially.",0,1419331210,null,0,false,0,cn35zbq,t3_2q4bnc,t1_cn35zbq,t1_cn32xbu,null,1425256358,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I understand giving people advice on the good and bad areas of Edinburgh (as /u/ieya404 and /u/allofthethings have done), but you've not accounted for the *reasons* people might be moving to the city. Different people will have different priorities and want different things from their lives in Edinburgh, and this post doesn't account for any of that. 

For example, I moved to Edinburgh for work. I had a job before I had a flat, and this was a major factor in deciding where to live (I work in Edinburgh Park). I didn't even look at places east of Haymarket because I didn't want a long commute. Had I come to this subreddit for advice and found this post, I'd have probably ended up second-guessing myself and not found my flat in Corstorphine (which, by the way, is about twice the size of anything in a similar price range that I looked at within your boundary).

This was my priority; being close to work, in a decent size flat that can accomodate friends and family who come to stay, with a short commute and regular access to the city centre. I can leave my flat and, if I time the buses right, be on Princes Street in under twenty minutes. I can leave my flat at 8:40 and be at work on time for 9. I'm able to keep my car, which lets me drive home to Newcastle on weekends to see my family, something I probably wouldn't have been able to afford had I lived in your bubble.

I don't want this to be an entirely negative post, so I do want to say that the advice about letting agents is spot on, as is the parts regarding deposits, bills, and broadband. Also the part about letting a room only; this is great advice if you're moving up alone and have a tight budget. I did this when I moved up the first time around aged 19, and it was definitely the right choice for me. www.spareroom.co.uk is the site I used, and a lot of the rooms include council tax and bills, which can definitely make it easier moving here for the first time.",0,1419331474,null,0,false,0,cn3614e,t3_2q4f03,t1_cn3614e,t3_2q4f03,null,1425256335,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

* Firstly, the SNP are only predicted to take 10 seats from labour... now in the context of Scottish elections that's hugely significant. However... in the context of a Westminster General Election its potentially less important. Especially given that the Lib dems are still expected to return around 20 seats.

* Secondly, the SNP have already said they won't do a deal with the Tories and any deal with labour is likely to have some serious strings attached... strings like a commitment to abandon Trident and press ahead with devo-max. It also means EVERY time labour have to pass a bill in parliament for the next 5 years, the SNP can hold them hostage over whatever issue floats their boat. It will be terrible for labour because a) it will solidify the image in Scotland that labour are finished and only the SNP can offer a left of center vision. b) It will prevent labour from delivering a manifesto that will make them popular with voters in England. I doubt labour would be prepared to accept this... Miliband might personally be willing in pursuit of the top job, but his party won't back it.

* Ultimately I don't see what the SNP can offer that will make a coalition with them remotely attractive outside of getting a foot through the door with a flimsy majority. It's also worth remembering this isn't 2010... we are no longer naive to coalitions. The Lib dems went into coalition expecting to come out with some form of proportional representation and boundary reform. What they ended up with was one giant 5-year-long PR disaster which might literally kill the party as a serious player for decades to come. Any party entering into coalition now is less likely to be so naive to its pitfalls having just witnessed what it's done to the Lib dems. 

So what will happen...? - My guess is **IF** there is no clear majority (i.e. Tory 32%, Labour 32%, Lib Dems 18%, UKIP 13% remainder 5%) then we're likely to see something a little bit like the **[First General Election of 1974](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974)** when Edward Heaths' incumbent conservative government failed to win an overall majority resulting in a hung parliament (where Labour had technically won about 10 more seats.... but the Tories had a larger portion of the vote share). Ultimately the Tories decided to simply call another election 6 months later in which Harold Wilsons Labour managed to win a narrow majority of just 3 seats.

Thank you! :)

&gt;He could move to a country with nice weather and a league that suits his pace and he wouldn't have to deal with opposing fans and the media.

Sure. But we are thinking of footballers as just pieces of property, robots.

If you had a job for 17 years and you were the absolute BEST at your company and gave everything to your company and you *loved* that company (the company you *always* wanted to work for!)... would you be so quick to accept that you've lost a step and move on to something that is easier?

... probably not. I sure wouldn't.

Now add the fact that you're working for an awesome company that was right in your hometown with all your childhood mates, your family, everything you know and love. Everything your wife and kids know and love.

Gets pretty hard to leave at that point, right?

You mentioned that ""I think [Gerrard] puts too much pressure on himself to actively be the match winner"" ... but now let's think *why* he does that. It's because his services are still required.

I believe if we are to truly honor the service and legacy of Steven Gerrard, the club must do better to surround him with the proper talent to help him win a title before he retires. Or, at the very least, allow Gerrard to leave for greener pastures (MLS? lol) in the way Chelsea did: Creating such a strong team that Lampard could ease out of the squad with a bit of dignity.

&gt;maybe a DOF would help him.

Perhaps. But, again, think of it as a business; After all, football *is* a business.

Rodgers was hired with the assumption that he can be the leader but to turn around and hire a DoF, then you are ultimately souring relations with Rodgers.

Imagine if you were hired to a company and given the power to make big changes, then a couple years later they suggest to you, ""Hm, maybe you need a bit of help. Here's this other older more experienced person."" How would you feel?

I would say, ""Fuck off, why did you hire me in the first place then?""

If we're talking DoF, may as well just sack Rodgers as well and hire a new manager who is clear about how ownership intends to run things administratively and transfer-wise and hire a DoF who would also have a clear understanding of his role with the ownership and the manager. That would eliminate confusion and instability in the ranks.

&gt;Could it be a mix of transfers, coaching and the lack of strikers as to why Rodgers isn't managing the team too well at the moment?

Of course. That's precisely what it is.

Our worst fears, unfortunately, came true: fair or not 'injury-prone' Sturridge lived up to his stereotype, the new players have not come together as quickly as we had dreamed in the sunny optimistic days of the summer, the defense and keeper were as shaky as we feared, we were unable to get the likes of Sanchez or Costa or whoever else we were allegedly linked with (Reus?????).

&gt;If we don't make CL will players that signed for us to specifically play CL Football want to leave?

Indeed. The economics of modern football have created a vicious cycle:

* Spend money to get CL.
* Use CL money to get CL quality players.
* Lose CL then lose the ability to financially retain CL quality players.
* Players you need to get the CL.

Think of it like the clubs who seem to perpetually float between the Premier League and the Championship. It's similar economics but on a smaller scale, of course.

So then the question is... How do you keep players from leaving?

Well, that's where I think a strong, confident, visionary manager is crucial and I think that's where Brendan Rodgers can truly earn his wages. When/if Champions League is not achieved... can he still make players believe that Champions League qualification and glory is merely a season or two away?

Now, here's the other bit of brilliance in the alleged FSG 'transfer policy' of signing young players...

It's *easier* to convince younger players who have their whole career ahead of them to stick with a club and help create a new era of glory. But, it's more difficult to convince proven CL-quality players in the prime of their careers - players who are suddenly quite aware of how small their window is as a professional footballer - to stay with a club who is still struggling to get a foothold on consistent Champions League play (let alone *win* the CL).

Case in point? 27-year-old Luis Suarez (28 in January).

His window was/is closing fast as is his chance to play at a top level for a CL club. And not just *any* CL club but a CL club who can potentially *win* the CL.

In a sort of fucked up, twisted, apologist sort of way, you almost have to respect Suarez for staying an additional season to get us to the CL in this current season. And you have to certainly give a lot of respect to our Stevie G for also showing the maturity and leadership - along with a keen awareness of how the business of football works - to convince Suarez to stay just one more season instead of bolting to Arsenal.

(Side note: I wouldn't be surprised if someday we see a gray-haired Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher quite successfully managing Liverpool and leading them to sustained glory, much to the ire of our rivals!)

In conclusion, the final question would be... 'Great. So what now?'

Well, the answer is as boring and unsexy as your parents constantly reminding you to save your money for the future.

We need to be patient.

There are few managerial options who are clear improvements beyond Rodgers. There are few candidates who are as young, stubborn and smart enough as Rodgers. There are few managerial candidates who are willing to fully learn, understand and embrace the culture of Liverpool and her beloved football club.

I think our ownership is for real as well. Their actions do not suggest they are looking to simply flip LFC to another owner for a profit. FSG are actively spending money and investing in players, they are actively investing in and making steady forward progress in the expansion of Anfield, etc. These actions do not suggest that they view LFC as a pet-project for a short while until they get bored; These actions suggest that ownership are in it for the long run.

This doesn't indicate a rise in antisemitism. When someone calls you a Kike in Sainsburys when you're clutching your kiddish wine and a bag of Matzah meal, that might count. 

Meanwhile, even the reactionary Graun acknowledges the incidents reported are related to the atrocities committed in Gaza. 

Meanwhile, the German bloke saying that the thing is the worst thing since Nazi Germany is just typical hyperbole you'll get from any Jewish person. When the binmen are late I think it's the worst thing since the Nazis. It's a reflex. 

Jewish people are infatuated with their persecution. There is a cultural reason for it and they can't help themselves, we are all slaves to culture.

You shouldn't treat him any differently because he is from another country, but the NHS and other benefits we enjoy won't exist if the borders are open.

false,[deleted],null,null,"I used to agree with you - as an atheist it's easy to believe all religions are basically the same as they all seem like such a load of bollocks. However when I really thought about this claim and started looking into world religions more I realised it's more complex. There's two claims you're making here.

1) The basic tenets of every religion are the same (in this case vis-a-vis freedom). This to me now seems quite an uninformed view to take. Are you saying that if one reads the Bible, the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, and the writings of L. Ron Hubbard, they all have exactly the same message? In fact their views on all sorts of important things, like the relationship of people to the respective god/s, and to members of other religions, differ significantly.

2) The ways religions are interpreted and used in society are the same. This also seems manifestly untrue - the use of religion in society can vary from a fundamentalist almost totalitarian system of control, to a subtle background framework of tradition and cultural norms. It seems clear to me that the [violent Buddhism of Muslim-attacking Thai monks](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22356306) is more damaging in that society than moderate Chinese Taoists. Similarly, it's entirely possible that the Islam, taken on average, of modern Western countries is more damaging than the average CofE church. (I'm not saying it definitely is, I haven't looked into it specifically enough, but the possibility is at least there).

So basically I'm saying, as a fellow atheist, religion is a lot more complex than ""it's all bollocks"", and seeing as [they're not going away anytime soon](http://www.sneps.net/RD/uploads/1-Shall%20the%20Religious%20Inherit%20the%20Earth.pdf) it's useful to learn about the real differences between them.",0,1419334321,null,0,false,0,cn36jzv,t3_2q5vkn,t1_cn36jzv,t1_cn36a5i,null,1425256090,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

I don't - they went to the banks asking for advice and expertise on whether they could afford a mortgage, and were informed they could. Some blame? Sure. Quite a lot? No chance.

The reason GDP per capita is good to look at is because if allows you to compare different countries at different times - if the UK has had a large increase in population (we have) then you expect all those new workers to add to the economy.

In the case of the UK, the total economic output has recovered to the pre-crisis peak so our economy is moving forward, but if you account for the increase in workforce and so look at it on a per-person basis we're still not to where we were in terms of 'output per person per year'.

My job is a retail analyst so when I look at a shop I consider 'revenue per visitor to store'. That's my #1 metric of success. If a shop is making more money this year, but only doing it because the amount of visitors has doubled (and actually they're making less money *per visitor*) then there's a serious question as to whether that shop is doing as effective a job as it should be.

UK economy is not hugely different (is it?) - we've increased the workforce, we've removed barriers to trade and we've reduced taxes - but the output per worker is still below where it was before the GFC despite all these incentives for people to work hard and grow the economy.

They might be somewhat related to antisemitism, people harbour all sorts of negative thoughts about different groups. After seeing the brutality of Israel, which associates itself with Jewishness and Jews, it's pretty normal for someone to think - those fucking Jews. I think that and I am one. But it's not antisemitism or not significantly antisemitism. It's one archaic way of reacting to the Jewish state. It's not the same as antisemitism as a social phenomenon where  someone will be denied a job because of jewishness or get called a theiving Jew when they come to collect the rent. 

&gt;By that logic, it's only ""understandable blowback"" to beat up your local convenience store owner for Pakistan providing shelter for Bin Laden.

Or maybe a better analogy would be beating them up if they were Saudi. Just picking on any convenience store owner would be bordering on the paediatrician beating level of stupidity. But yes. It would be logical on the same level, as blowback. (I'm assuming you understand that I don't applaud this or synagogue burning). 

&gt;So that to you (""might"") count as antisemitism, but fire-bombing a Synagogue isn't?

Firebombing a shul is not a commonplace activity and is only done by very fanatic people (the proof is in the pudding, right?) and doesn't represent antisemitism although it could be referred to as an antisemitic act. Someone making derogatory remarks or acting against someone's interests because of tribal or racial hatred in everyday life is far more indicative. So firebombing the shul is antisemitic in its nature but not antisemitism. 

&gt;Which has 0 to do with almost any Jew living in Europe, or even most Jews in Israel.

Not true. I think an overwhelming majority of Jews defend everything that Israel does and support the right of every Jew to be an occupier in Palestine. But the key thing is that the state of Israel's PR machine ropes all Jewish people into the picture at every opportunity. 

If there was a massive PR operation to link jazz violinists to the spread of Ebola by the jazz violinists' union and some very sensitive people went nuts and bombed Jean-Luc Ponty, I wouldn't regard it a rise in jazz violinist hatred. 

&gt;I'm glad I'm no slave to whatever culture that spawned you.

Jewish and Israeli culture spawned me. To some amusing extent, it forced me to question all of the narratives I was given. If you're a slave to some other culture, you are still in the same boat. It makes no difference.

That's exactly what I said: ""Even taking your algebra example, algebra was not brought to the UK by the actual Muslim scientists who came up with it, it diffused through the media of the time."" My point is that, contrary to what is often claimed by some, 'the spread of new ideas' is not a good argument for population diversity, because new ideas do not actually chiefly spread though migration.

&gt; I don't see how Islam is having any particular effect on modern culture

There are two effects that concern me the most:

1) It pushes non-Muslims to the right who would not otherwise be there. It's obvious that the main draw of UKIP is their policies on immigration and British identity, and we also know from all these gaffes that Islam is a big concern of those in UKIP. However we also know that [UKIP voters are less economically right wing than conservative voters](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2014/nov/21/rochester-byelection-beliefs-of-ukip-voters), and far less right wing than their own party leadership. I.e, they primarily vote UKIP due to the recent large changes in the identity of the UK population. This isn't to blame those immigrants who've contributed to the change - it is, I'm afraid, just how lots of people behave, wherever they're from when they feel their culture is under threat. This distorts our politics and distracts from other issues. Who is 'to blame' ie. is it Labour for pushing multiculturalism and mass immigration, or is it UKIP for pushing back, isn't what I'm talking about, the affects are here anyway.

2) The [chilling effect on culture due to fear of violence](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/11/channel-4-cancels-screening-islam).

Politics is simply a reference to the group standards by which we live; our collection of *policies* arrived at by discourse and power struggle. We inherit them as legacy; we modify them very slowly over time as technology and perspectives change. World-view affects policy. (Ir)religious subscription is at the core of any given individual's world view (which is precisely why secularism is the *only* approach, given the mutual exclusion of the various religious doctrines).

I find it grossly ignorant of people that they fails to understand how absolutely inseparable a theocratic world-view is from a political world-view even in modern societies where religion - if even just their local one - is misunderstood as benign.

Islam is a revised weaponisation of a previously, repeatedly revised weapon. Theism is inherently political. Islam is the most refined version to date.

Germans weren't a race either. When did we let Hitler and his fucking coven set the terms? 

&gt;If you are hopelessly incapable of separating an individual from the actions of others from the same religion/race, maybe. Not everyone is going to tar people with the same brush, because you know, that actually is racist?

We all categorise and are categorised all the time. You bloody hipster (or whatever). The emotional mechanism is what it is and doesn't always correspond to the later rational reaction to a situation. Israel is connected to Jews, everyone of whom I am aware apart from a tiny minority supports the genocidal state of Israel. Even Norman Finklestein does and I practically idolise the man. 

&gt;No, it's just the same because in both cases neither culpable for the actions of another.

Culpability isn't the issue. I have not suggested a Jewish religious building somewhere in Germany is responsible for the murder of thousands of Palestinians. Most of the people who visit the building are probably not. But to associate those people with support for the murders  is, emotionally not too far out since their representatives around the world are perpetually advertising that their communities support the genocide and dispossession. 

&gt;It's not anti-Semitism because it is rare?

You got it. It's an antisemitic act done very likely as an emotional response to being aware of the Jewish state's brutality. The state that has the vocal support of the organisations that claim to represent the Jewish community. 

&gt;Did it ever occur to you that maybe these fanatics get approval for their actions from an virulently toxic and anti-Semitic environment they are brought up in?

What environment is that? Are there such environments in Europe you can identify? I live in England and have never experienced or heard about such intenesely hateful communities. I am more concerned about the intense feelings expressed by the BNP/EDL/UKIP contingent. 

&gt;I'd ask you to prove that, but we both know that's utter crap. And agreeing to what Israel is doing should not be considered invitation to violence under any circumstances.

It's hard to prove anything. Try proving you exist... Anyway, I have been surrounded by Jewish people all my life and I can not find someone who questions the legitimacy of the state of Israel or will seriously criticise the state's behaviour. Until the internet, I was unaware that anyone had these criticisms at all and the number of Jewish people who do are relatively few. 

If you think otherwise, I can't help you. Maybe the issue isn't of interest to you or you have a perspective that thinks that Israel shouldn't respond quite so harshly to Hamas' unprovoked rocket attacks.

&gt;An orchestrated campaign to demonise a group of people does not count as hate to you?

Depends on the circumstances. 

&gt;I'm willing to bet it did not.

You'd lose the bet and have to label me a self-hater because I can't be right. Only the people who follow the accepted narratives are right. I must be one of those antisemites and so it goes. 

You can never know anything about the world you inhabit. A shame.

&gt; We inherit them as legacy; we modify them very slowly over time as technology and perspectives change.

As did the Muslim world. Note how the regressions into violence in the 20th century follow other violence. The rise of ""Radical"" Islam is in response to the ""perspectives"" brought about by our bombs and dictators. Not just our bombs of course, secular Gaddafi for example had his own ""radicals"" to deal with as do the atheist Russians.

No there aren't. There are because AFRICA and there are many Christian communities that also do it there. This has nothing whatsoever to do with one specific religion. That you believe this is quite telling for someone that accuses me of ""ignorance"" multiple times.

Again bullshit. You could swap any belief systems into this situation (including atheism) and the same results would happen. The situation there is entirely tribal, it's ""my group verses your group"".

The rise of terrorism in Palestine is a direct response to Israel controlling the borders of Palestine since 1967.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Well I can see your implication that it would make many muslims feel like the state is against them which could indeed make them less positive about integration, and you are probably right. However two points:

1) I think it's unlikely that continuing large scale immigration and allowances for Islam in public life will lead to integration either - so me it seems like the best of two bad options.

2) History shows that in fact, these sorts of policies can lead to integration, or at least do not prevent it, despite doubtless being unpopular with the groups themselves. One example would be Jewish refugees to Britain in the early 20th century (eventually cut off by acts in 1905 and 1919) - who went from speaking Yiddish in East London ghettos to integrating into national life well. Another would be immigrants from Catholic and Eastern Europe to the US in a similar time period, restricted in 1924, who before the act were comparatively poor and living (and voting) in ethnic blocs, and afterwards fully integrated with the rest of (white) america.

Of course I'm not saying there's direct causation between these immigration restrictions and successful integration - the groups may have integrated just as well without the restriction. However the restriction and the successful integration were definitely contemporaneous. It seems to make sense that a group is more likely to integrate (e.g. in terms of family formation and cultural norms) if the flow of people bringing the original cultural norms (and potential marriage partners) is cut off.

I mean, look at something like Christianity. Oh, a book that was written a couple of thousand years ago says all this stuff about a God and Jesus and miracles and things that we know aren't true, things that seem outrageous, and beliefs that are unacceptable today. To think that this is likely to be true (the Bible that is) to me seems to take a lapse in critical judgement. It just seems crazy to think this to me. 

I'm not really against spiritualism or believing in God - I don't know if there's a God or not. But what I do know - at least suspect to a high probability - is that the Christian God does not exist. Because the evidence we have for him are a bunch of books written by men that are full of falsehoods and that there *is no reason to place any authority in at all*. For the Christian God to then turn out to be real would just be a massive coincidence. 

I certainly would never say kill someone because they are a religion... but to me, the idea of religion in a vacuum just seems pointless and silly. The only reservation I have is that some people - for some reason I can't really fathom - seem to inspired by religion. I don't understand why people aren't just inspired by the natural world or by the books just on their own (i.e., as works of fiction). But if getting rid of Christianity meant I'd have to stop listening to Bach, I'd put up with religion. 

I don't know. This is something that's bugged with forever really. I'm just going to post this... sorry if I've come across as offensive.

There's very clever critiques of those arguments too that question whether the universe needs an exterior justification, and that the whole argument is therefore meaningless.

Thank you, I agree that 'atheist' is not always a very helpful world. IMHO 'worldviews' is the category we need.

Any education system comes with a worldview. Different worldviews disagree about what are facts and what are opinions. Obviously, it's a fact that God gave us minds and since he has revealed himself as the Word, he clearly prizes logical, rational communication. The Bible contains rational argument and emotional poetry. So education should equip children to argue and understand things rationally, and to speak emotionally about people and things that are beautiful (and ugly, and deformed, and....). So there should be some really basic things that we can all agree should be taught in school, but there might be other things that are less clear.

The ""obviously"" in that paragraph is tongue-in-cheek: different redditors will have different views about which of those sentences are facts and which are opinions. /u/waglman wants to exclude some of those worldviews from the (state?) education system and to privilege others. I'm arguing that we should allow people of many different worldviews to teach them to their children and to have their taxes used to teach them *en masse*.

Of course, such a pluralistic society will still need somebody to be Minister of Education. I'd argue that the societies that have done this most successfully (England, Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland) have in common a culture and/or legal system that is influenced by Reformed Christianity.

Yes, they did shitty things in the past. Yes, they're quite cunty about beating us. 

But when it gets down to it, I care about watching good football. I'd rather watch an Arsenal game where they pass quickly, take a dozen shots, and score 3 over a crystal Palace game which has 2 shots on target the whole game and both teams play 10 people behind the ball. 

So yes, I dislike them as a team for some of the shitty stuff. But I'm not from North London; this isn't a ""your turf, my turf"" thing for me.

And while I love my club and am a yiddo til I die, I can't just foam at the mouth with every mention of Arsenal. 

And to be honest, I wish we'd focus a bit less on Arsenal.

Either way my point wasn't one of statistics, it wouldn't surprise me if superstitious beliefs decrease with education.

My point was that getting an education doesn't necessitate renouncing religious beliefs. For many people it strengthens them. It's flat out plain wrong to assume education and reason always leads to atheism. People study for decades and grapple with these problems and still remain religious. When keyboard warriors to come along with little actual religious education and start acting like they have the monopoly on truth that's downright dickheaded and stupid.

Citation please because that's not what it says on wiki.

&gt;What you're doing is conflating material, poltical and economic ascendency with knowledge. The reason that non-western societies haven't produced independent scientific at the same rate as the ""western"" ones is simply a factor of where the money, power and prestige is. 

Actually, there are a lot of reasons for the ascendency of knowledge as you succinctly put it in the west and there was a good BBC documentary series about it. One of those reasons is almost certainly because of moving away from using religious texts and teachings as sources of education during the enlightenment. Conversley in the muslim world, they've done the opposite and.. well..

&gt;The twentieth century all those other societies were coming off the back colonialism. In most cases they were just forming new nation states, and forming their own institutions and developing new ways of organizing society. 

Completely ignoring the fact that the reason they were colonised was because they weren't as advanced at the time. If they had been the more advanced society they would have been the ones doing the colonising.

However... in the context of a Westminster General Election its potentially less important. Especially given that the Lib dems are still expected to return around 20 seats.

Where are you getting those figures from? The article says 54 is Survation's prediction. Personally, I'd say that's probably a high figure as the methodology is based on a uniform swing (in Scotland, rather than across the UK as I think your figures are coming from) and they're probably looking at peaking closer to thirty or so. These figures change what the SNP brings to the table. 

Regarding what they'd demand, trident and devo-max wise, those were floated as the price of coalition. As you said, no party is naive of the politics of coalition any more, the SNP would want something really juicy for such a big gamble with their electoral health, especially considering it could jeopardise their position going in to the 2016 Scottish Election. A Confidence and Supply arrangement would be far more likely, in my opinion, with a view to getting a better deal than the Smith Commission was offering, and pulling policy in a more left-ward direction. 

As to what might happen in Scotland, if Labour went in with the SNP, to ignore them when a feasible working majority was on the table, to further what Scotland voted for, would probably crystallise their losses. Ignoring Scotland's choice would just reinforce the SNP's rhetoric. There's also the fact that the SNP are not like UKIP, in that they have a much longer history and have been/are in Government. UKIP might be susceptible the 'flash in the pan' snap election destruction, but the SNP would not be, at least not to the same extent.

&gt;You're coming from a base assumption that religion isn't ever a viable or valuable discourse or practice when for others it's the most important thing to them.

That is fair to say yes, I don't see any value in it. just because it may give people comfort or purpose or make them feel nice does not make it true.

&gt;My point was that getting an education doesn't necessitate renouncing religious beliefs. For many people it strengthens them.

I agree with that somewhat, except that last bit. Education does not strengthen belief, it will just raise questions, questions chip away at indoctrination. That is why, as linked above education and religion are inversely correlated.

&gt;It's flat out plain wrong to assume education and reason always leads to atheism. People study for decades and grapple with these problems and still remain religious.

Well it isn't as shown in the top hit on google for 'education religion correlation'. In general, that is the truth, more educated, less likely to believe. Simple fact mate.

false,properteaistheft,eng-norfolk,Norfolk County,"An “independent” campaign group whose professionally produced website The Lib/Lab/Con aims to “expose the weaknesses of the political elite” has been bankrolled by one of Ukip’s biggest donors and is backed by the party’s leadership.


The Financial Times has learnt that LibLabCon.com is funded by Arron Banks, a Bristol-based insurance tycoon who promised £1m to Ukip ahead of the general election. The site may offer some clues about his priorities.




In bold lettering on its homepage over a black-and-white photograph of David Cameron being mocked by a hooded teenager is the phrase: “We aren’t rightwing, leftwing or any-wing . . . we treat all politicians with equal contempt”.



The expletive-ridden site features headlines such as “Should the Death Penalty be Returned for Child Murder?” and repeated attacks on Westminster politicians from the three main parties, laced with attempts at humour.



It describes the MP Chuka Umunna as “Labour’s chief spokesman for tokenism” and says that human rights group Amnesty International campaigns for “loudmouth idiots chained to a radiator”.



LibLabCon is vague about its backing, saying it is made up of “private individuals” who have engaged the services of “professional campaigners” to run it. Despite reading scores of pages on the website the FT was unable to find any mention of Mr Banks.



In early November the domain was registered to Arron Banks at Lysander House in Bristol — the address of his insurance company GoSkippy. The site is hosted in the US and the domain name had previously been up for sale. In late November, the site was re-registered via Identity Protect Limited in an apparent attempt to mask the identity of its backer.



Two senior Ukip figures told the FT that Mr Banks was still funding the website. Asked about the site, Mr Banks said in an emailed response that LibLabCon was “a collection of people, the main writers are ex-Labour and Green Party, with an ex-CCO as a main contributor”, adding: “I don’t write stories.” He did not address the issue of the site’s ownership or funding in his reply.


The Ukip leadership is enthusiastic about the site. “Arron Banks is brilliant,” said Andrew Reid, general secretary. “I’m so pleased with that website . . .  not only a man with money but also a man with fresh ideas.”



Tim Aker, head of policy, has tweeted a link to the site, saying: “Now this is very good”.



The website criticises the leaders of the three main political parties, suggesting that they are all “best friends” and grew up in country mansions. But while David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband were all raised in comfortable homes, none has anywhere near the wealth enjoyed by Mr Banks himself.



The self-made tycoon owns and rents for weddings an imposing mansion in Gloucestershire, previously owned by Mike Oldfield, the rock star behind the album “Tubular Bells”. The mansion, with sweeping views of the Severn Estuary, has an orangery and a “magnificent Grand Hall”.



Mr Banks, who is worth an estimated £100m — and is a former Tory donor — says he started with nothing in life and now lives in a “very pleasant 5 bedroom 14th century cottage with nice open fire”. He co-founded the Brightside insurance firm and also has interests in diamond mines in South Africa.



He came to prominence during the last Tory conference in September when he offered £100,000 to Ukip, only for foreign secretary William Hague to say he had never heard of him. In a dramatic riposte, Mr Banks increased his offering, to £1m although it will be paid in instalments.



LibLabCon.com began a Twitter feed on November 4. It also has a blog, penned under the pseudonym “Statler and Waldorf” — an illusion to the two Muppets — which is relentlessly scathing about Westminster politicians.



The website is not openly supportive of Ukip but there are hints of support. After Ukip leader Nigel Farage was ridiculed for criticising “ostentatious” breast-feeding in public places, the blog leapt to his defence.



A survey invited readers to say who had been the biggest “bullshitter” of the year: as of December 17 Mr Farage had zero votes with David Cameron at 53 per cent and Ed Miliband at 20 per cent.



News of Mr Banks’ funding for the website comes days after Ukip advised its members to stay off Twitter after a string of online gaffes. Websites have been told they can only use the party logo if they obtain “express written consent”.



Despite retweets from some Ukip activists, mainstream success has eluded LibLabCon.com — it had just 722 followers on Twitter as of December 22. A large proportion are Ukip activists. Traffic figures for the site were not available.

That's not answering my question, nobody ever denied it was ever used for the take-away, it was not the case in Smith's usage. Farage's mistake was in trying to blur the colloquial use of the term for the food with the usage to describe a person. 
That said, looking at what was posted about it here, some people have honestly never used it for the food, some have often, some use it as an ironic nick-name for a close friend, but many (if not most) would agree it's insulting when applied to a person you don't really know. In my own experience, it's never even used for the food, let alone person. 

&gt; Mitchell showed specific, non-joking disdain for the working class and was presenting himself as a lord and master. Emily Thornberry was stitched up. 

It could be argued that what Mitchell shouted was at the heat of the moment, towards officers who were in fact obstructing his way out. It was not a considered remark or joke he shared with someone with whom he confided with. But in any case, both he and Thornberry were removed for pretty much the same reason. Neither of us could what impact that specific remark had, but given the public hunger for that type of outrage and media interest in the Mitchell and Thornberry case, I just find it unlikely he would have stayed anyway.

(The Chinese population of malaysia did not want to live in a state dominated by Malays and so split off to form Singapore, a state where they are the majority.) Although de jure it's a multicultural state, de facto Chinese dominate numerically, politically, culturally, and financially. Its social harmony is bought at the cost of liberty, for example they [do not have trial by jury](http://www.postcolonialweb.org/singapore/government/leekuanyew/lky2.html) because they did not think jurors will treat members of their own vs others ethnic groups equally. Another example is that each apartment building in Singapore has an enforced [ethnic quota](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2011/02/race-issues-in-singapore-is-the-hdb-ethnic-quota-becoming-a-farce/). These policies are quite practical solutions to Singapore's situation, but it's not a free society or one I'd want to emulate.

2) The Netherlands and the UK. Historically these have actually been quite homogenous, especially in the periods when they were the most successful societies vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Today both countries are living off a huge amount of social capital generated from the past few centuries, when there was not internal ethnic division. The UK actually achieved its unity between the component nations through violence against the Welsh, Irish and Highland Scots before this period.

I agree that being homogenous is no guarantee of social harmony and success either and I'd agree re: Libya. Somalia however I'd definitely disagree. There are many markers of difference that can be used, in Europe we've used religion, language and race at different times, in Somalia it's the clan -  [Somalia's been riven by clan conflict](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15056.html) for decades.",0,1419344852,null,0,false,0,cn399ue,t3_2q5vkn,t1_cn399ue,t1_cn38mte,null,1425254751,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

i'm not saying either that reina would have kept us in the champions league im saying being in the league the money generated more than would have covered him, but on that note he's experienced, he knows a lot of the madrid players and played this completion many times, he wouldn't have let the defense be running around headless no matter how bad his personal form was. 

I honestly believe the reason mignolet has survived and played so much in the last 18 months and got away with so much was because he was out only viable option for so long, brendan knew we had no other choice but jones and so was forced to stick with mignolet

I think religion appeals to those who like to take a more poetic view of human life, at least some of the time. Ie, a truth that is ""felt"" intuitively can be as valid as one that is scientifically provable. So you end up trying to define ""truth"" and I think that is what the whole science/religion thing boils down to. 

If your critical thinker only accepts provable fact as true, then it's no surprise that, to him/her, only scientific fact is true and religion worthless. Those who wear pink glasses should expect to see a rosy world (they may miss things coloured blue/green though).

Only fundamentalists expect faith teachings to be the basis of scientific fact. Eg, most religious people are happy to accept creation accounts as being allegorical. 

BTW, one thing that all the major religions require of followers is self-criticism, in the form of prayer, meditation, confession, etc. The follower is expected to measure themselves on a regular basis against the ideal and (at least try to) correct their failings.

Our 433 had SG staying very deep, with the FBs advanced, thus forming a 3. So in a transition to attack we went from 433 to 343 and arguably eventually 325 when overlapping and attacking their box if in control. 

So I actually think that what BR has done is make that third defender role ""permanent"" rather than let SG do it.

This a) frees up Gerrard to go forward more, and cos b) SG is not that good a defender. 

This does mean that at times we have 5 at the back which is definitely different from last year but the focus on Sterling as counterattack outlet has been effective and then the two wide men can get back up the pitch as the opposition retreat.

&gt;If your critical thinker only accepts provable fact as true, then it's no surprise that, to him/her, only scientific fact is true and religion worthless. Those who wear pink glasses should expect to see a rosy world (they may miss things coloured blue/green though).

The only method we have for establishing truth is the scientific method. Everything else is just making shit up, quite frankly. I don't see anything wrong with that approach to the world, because it makes sense. If there was an alternative method for finding truth provided by religion i might be interested, but close your eyes and hope for the best doesn't cut it for me.

&gt;Only fundamentalists expect faith teachings to be the basis of scientific fact. Eg, most religious people are happy to accept creation accounts as being allegorical. 

Yeah, if they all did that we wouldn't have any problems. Trouble is, you can't get rid of the extreme interpretations. Better to just get shot of all of it imo.

We don't have the money for him this winter either.  I'd expect him to be 25mil+ if Lyon would even be willing to hear an offer for him at all in January.  James Pearce already reported that Liverpool has limited funds for the winter, so even if we sell Borini I don't think we'll have the cash for Lacazette on his own, let alone Lacazette + a top keeper.  I personally think we need a keeper more than a forward, especially if BR gives Borini a little more of a chance if Sturridge ends up injured again.  Just as Carra points out, Lambert and Balotelli can't pressure from the front and allow us to play the pressing game we need, but Borini can do that.  He's perhaps not very clinical, but he can absolutely hound defenders and work his socks off to enable our creative players.  

Reality is we'll have to work with limited resources this winter and if we can utilize a player we already have as opposed to bringing in an 8-10mil player who is no better than the one we'd be selling to get him anyway, why bother?  I'd rather us throw the cash we have at the right goalkeeper and then deal with the forward position in the summer.

&gt;One of those reasons is almost certainly because of moving away from using religious texts and teachings as sources of education during the enlightenment. Conversley in the muslim world, they've done the opposite and.. well..

This is just illiterate. Which ""scientific texts"" are you talking about? Post 1792 or before 1792.  As for ""development""  - the Ottomans were comparable in firepower and development until 1750s when their internal bickering and good old politics began their decline. Mehmet Fateh pioneered the use of Canon, Beyazid II pioneered the use of field artillery. The most important unit in the Ottoman empire were the Janissaries who were given muskets and trained in their use.

Akbar was building monuments and Shah Jehan was building his Taj Mahal using maths, trig and all sorts of scientific knowledge in India. Shah Abbas of the Safavid was doing the same in Iran. ALL three courts had astronomers royal, mathematicians and physicians in abundance , all of whom used the knowledge they had from people like Ibn Sina. 

So no you're whole idea of what the ""Islamic world"" was doing is formed off the internet and hanging about with Dawkinistas way too long. 


&gt;Completely ignoring the fact that the reason they were colonised was because they weren't as advanced at the time. 

Firstly that's a DANGEROUSLY essentialist argument that comes very close to genetic determinism. So you need have a think about what you mean by that. 

Secondly , it's just can't be applied to all of colonialism. India was colonised because the Mughal empire imploded and the East India company took advantage, eventually had to form an empire.  The idea that they were ""less advanced"" is something that the Victorians and eugenicists came up with to justify their claims on other people's lands. 

Again , you're reading sources that are more interested in triumphalism than fact.

People are being really quick to ask things like ""are you serious???"" and accuse people of ignorance. 

You said you can - and should - educate religion away. Their counter argument seems to be but Islam alone can be credited with a number of scientific achievements. Regardless of whether we should or not, there does seem to be evidence that the more educated you are the less likely you are to be religious. So what you said is not really an insane thing to believe. The only way his counter-argument makes sense to me is if you said that believing in religion makes you unable to be critical/scientific.

false,jdhan2006,lfc68,,"I like the 3-4-3 a lot.  I posted earlier how I think 3 at the back solves a lot of the problems defensively.  And it does if LFC had a legit goalie it would be even better.  The key to the formation is pressing by the front three, positional awareness by the wingbacks and good cover by the back three.  

First the pressing has been superb by the front three.  Lallana, Coutinho and Sterling have done a fantastic job of this against United and Arsenal.  Lallana has been exceptional at finding the space between the DM and the CBs like he did at Southampton and his turns and movement is what we paid for.  Sterling lacks that killer instinct up top but I can forgive him.  Coutinho needs to work on some things (shot accuracy and tracking runners) but is improving.  

Second the wingbacks.  Henderson and Markovic did an excellent job negating Welbeck and Sanchez from the game.  If you re watch the match they often stay close to their assignments, but are aggressive when they need to be.  Markovic looks like a proper player and is a little confidence away from adding goals to a much improved game looking forward to him in the second half of the season, might even see him move into the two behind the striker if we ever get Sturridge fit for Moreno or GJ or (God help us ) Enrique.  

Third.  The defense has actually played better.  They are still bad and make terrible mistakes but they are more composed and better as a unit.  Individual errors seem to define the back line and until that is fixed it will continue to struggle.  However the keeper situation is an absolute nightmare.  Jones isn't good enough.  Mings actually would do better in this system as playing from the back he will have more options.  And to be honest if he was playing against Arsenal we may have won.  

Once January comes I will be optimistic.  I think a GK is priority number 1.  We get Flanno back (a great defensive wingback), Sturridge may be back and if a solid GK is bought there stands a chance they can go on a run.  Also I hope they pay 5 mil and bring in Origi, he will slide perfectly into this system.

I said religious texts, not scientific. So kindly retract your accusations of illiteracy.

One nation, the most modern one of them all, which still fell way short of western European nations. Remind me again, where did Attaturk get his ideas from again anyway?

Besides the point anyway, you can't say any of that development was attributable to Islam. Pretty weak argument to be honest, any development there was in spite of Islam and still fell well short of enlightened europe.

&gt; Firstly that's a DANGEROUSLY essentialist argument that comes very close to genetic determinism. So you need have a think about what you mean by that. 

What the fuck are you on about? I am talking about societies not individuals.

&gt;Secondly , it's just can't be applied to all of colonialism. India was colonised because the Mughal empire imploded and the East India company took advantage, eventually had to form an empire. The idea that they were ""less advanced"" is something that the Victorians and eugenicists came up with to justify their claims on other people's lands. 

They were less advanced in india, they didn't have industry like the UK did. It's got nothing to do with genetics, I have said nothing like that whatsoever. The reasons they didn't have that advancement was because nobody did, western Europe was first (one of many reasons for this was due to the throwing off of religious dogma in favour of scientific inquiry but not the only factor). If some other society had been first, it would be a much different world today. There's nothing triumphant in that statement, nor in any of my statements.

When mainstream politics and politicians start declaring that it's fine to use the word 'ch***y' or that every minor problem in the world, such as a traffic jam, can be blamed on foreigners, or that the sole cause of problems with infrastructure is immigration, then racism is legitimised. 

When their candidates refer to gay people as 'poofters' and and Asians as 'ch***ys' or when the leader of the third highest polling party in Britain says he'd be worried if Romanians moved in next door, or that it's fine to wear black-face then racism is legitmised. 

Or how about when a UKIP candidate said that Lenny Henry should emigrate to a 'black country', and another candidate referred to Islam as, ""organised crime under religious camouflage"" and then likened it to Nazism.

Come on, what exactly did he contribute today? If you didn't see anything poor at all today, you're ignoring it or spinning them into a positive direction. Maybe that's why you're confused. You say vague things like ""feel like I have a good general understanding of how Chelsea play and he always seems to do a wonderful job for what he is tasked to do"" which have no substance. So him only providing cover and defense as the right winger is supposed to be a good thing when we have Matic and Mikel playing? Also, his crosses were not great. In the second half, he made a cross straight into the box that went straight into a defender. I'm pretty sure that was his single cross of the game too. 

There were my observations playing close attention to him all game:

* Whenever he received a ball, he looked scared. I think he attempted to get past 2 defenders all game long. When Hazard, Fabregas or even Matic received similar balls yesterday, they would either try to dribble past a defender and/or try to pass the ball ahead if there was opportunity. 


* Passes were way too conservative. Matic took more risks. Like a couple of times on the counter he would receive the ball. He'd go a great job controlling it and going ahead until he gets to a defender. He'd then just stand there on top of the ball and fake using his right leg until he'd pass it back to Matic or Mikel, killing the attack. 

* Positioning. For all his great features tracking back, pressing and covering, he doesn't do anything off the ball on offense. I'd rarely ever see him make a run off the ball or position himself in a way to create chances. 

* Shooting was typical poor. Now he's not a great goal scorer, but his shooting was poor like most of the time. I think he took two shots in the second half. First shot is a low power shot on the ground straight to Begovic. Second shot I don't remember exactly but it wasn't testing Begovic either.

Now, I get this sounds harsh, but I'm tired of any genuine criticism on Willian being responded with, ""I'm confused and I don't understand how people thought he was poor. I thought his job well!"" That's a cop out excuse for his lack of production going forward. Saying he had a good game yesterday is nonsensical.

source: 9 month, £1500 ordeal with BT which ended with me £300 up.

story: I moved house, arranged months in advance as I work from home, BT fucked up and told me 3 weeks without internet, I told them to fuck off and went with Virgin, they continued to bill me saying I never cancelled (I did, but over the phone where there was mysteriously 'no record')

The address is: 

BT Correspondence Centre
Providence Row
Durham
DH98 1BT

Here is a copy of my letter, should you wish to use as a template:

**RE: The repeated unlawful attempts to bully a family into outrageous payments**

*To Whom It May Concern,*

*This letter is in response to the repeated attempts to try and bully and trick my family into paying fictitious bills for a service which was never received.*
    Account Number: *****
    Assigned Phone Number: *****

*If you were to run a check on our phone line, you would find that our address has never had a BT line fitted since we moved in on the 8th August 2014. We received services at our prior address, and contacted BT before we moved house, in the hopes that your company could assist us in the transition. Having family who work from home we explained at the time that it was absolutely paramount to minimise downtime between moving addresses. I contacted BT several times prior to the move, despite the horrendous customer service and difficult telephone systems we had to navigate, in order to provide clear and precise updates to your staff to make this transition as simple as possible. *

*Despite our best efforts, your company managed to fail at every task, despite checking numerous times, it turned out that our new address did NOT have a BT line attached to the house, it had been cut by the previous tenant and was completely inoperable. After contacting customer service to discuss the next steps, your customer service representatives suggested that the quickest solution would be to simply nullify our original contracts, and start from scratch with a new contract as we were still within the 14 day cooling off period and out of contract for our previous address, there would be no charge. However, it was made clear that we would have to wait weeks, possibly months before an engineer could visit our property and begin any action. So with hesitance, knowing that there would be no unsettled commitments after years of being a loyal customer who always paid on time, we decided we would take our services elsewhere. *

*Within 5 days of contacting Virgin Media our new services had been fitted, with better speeds that we could have ever expected with BT, and a fantastic UK based customer support line, frankly BT could learn a lot.*

*Recently, despite having been told our services had stopped, and having received refunds for the mistakes you have previously made, we are now receiving bills requesting almost £100 and harassing phone calls threatening further action. Please note, that we still do not have a BT line in operation at our address, it has never been functional, we have never had a visit from a BT engineer and there is no physical way that your company could provide services to this address.Any mistakes on your system, are purely the result of the actions of your staff.*

*To be frank, I am angered to the point where I demand retribution, you have absolutely no right to be harassing me or my elderly family members for errors which are clearly caused by your company. I would like to receive a formal written apology along with clear written confirmation that no monies are owed. If the harassing phone calls continue, or if there is any further communication about fictitious debt, I will not hesitate to include the financial ombudsman in this situation and seek legal advice, along with the appropriate reparations for the confusion and harassment your company has enacted.*

*I sincerely hope that you will understand the significance of this matter and proceed with great caution. Under the freedom of information act I request that you please include with your response copies of any correspondence relating to this matter, please ensure you check for other account numbers, because at one point due to the incapability of your staff we actually had 3 account numbers in operation, again we were told this matter had been solved, but the credibility of your staff has proven to be worthless. I would also like to receive copies of any recordings of conversations which have taken place, or any evidence whatsoever that you may claim to have regarding this issue.*

Interestingly enough....i think if he was Irish (or Scottish or English or Welsh) coming from the Championship the club would be getting more claims of ""not showing ambition"" from a large chunk of supporters and the player would be written off as ""filler"" until he proved something.

Think about Charlie Austin as an example, in the summer (knowing absolutely nothing about what he would do this season) if we had signed Austin 75% of Spurs supporters would have gone through the fucking roof in a rage that we were signing a striker from Burnley for £9m and not spending £30m on a striker from Porto. Levy and Baldini would be getting  lambasted for leading the club down a poor path and Poch would be called out for having no idea what to do with transfers.....now, people are putting his name forward as a player we should look at.

During the summer we were linked with a teenage RB from Ireland, Ryan Manning, kid is considered a fairly good prospect (saw him referred to as the best Irish prospect since Seamus Coleman), but he is playing in the Irish league.  I saw people this summer stating that a TEENAGER playing in Ireland would be a waste of money to sign....

Yet oddly enough if Yedlin (or Austin, or Manning) had been Latvian and playing for Anderlecht, or Ajax or FC Twente or Porto....many more (not all) supporters would give a blanket initial impression that he was good before he even set a foot on the pitch.

Well, I also work in the City and it's long been thrown at me that I'm obviously a benefit cheater for being on here asking that other people in the country I live in might get a taste of what I get. Sorry if I insulted you, but maybe you need a dose of reality to see how other people see our profession and maybe understand why people are so angry. I'm painting myself with that brush but at the same time I pay my taxes, campaign for tax increases on the upper bracket and donate to charity - I am definitely unusual among my team, who blow huge chunks of it on blokes weekends, gadgets and cars.

&gt;To a normal person a banker may seem to be living an extravagant life.

That's because he is, there is no dispute that in comparison to his countrymen he is living an extravagant life. Many bankers receive bonuses which a double figure multiples of the average annual salary. They are living lives with no relation to their average countrymen.

&gt;To a poor person in India or Africa that normal British person is living a life of luxury, what with their meals out, their holidays to Spain, their consumption of expensive liquour, their big TVs, etc. 

Do we live in India or Africa? 

And by the way, this is not a great point. If to a poor person in India an average Brit is in luxury, what do they think of our rich bankers? Living in heaven?

&gt; Neither the regular joe nor the regular banker are living in the lap of luxury, it just seems that way from certain points of view.

No, the regular banker is living in the lap of luxury, luxury flat, never worried about feeding themselves, never worry about clothing themselves, while some of the regular Joes literally starve to death due to benefit sanctions. 

It's this sort of myopic view that drives people crazy - I don't care if by Indian standards our poor are doing OK. If we're going down that road, why don't we judge ourselves by North Korean standards and declare poverty eliminated?

At the end of the day, all I am calling for is a minor rebalancing.

I don't think UKIP has as much power over people's minds as you think. I just think it's more that racist people were waiting for UKIP to come along and started voting for them. And in fact, as you will know, did happen with a lot of people who were voting for the first time during the last few by-elections and EU votes. 

On the other hand I wonder whether the media's obsession with UKIP isn't doing damage by giving them legitimacy and articles like this contribute towards it. 

Either way I just don't think it's fair, just because UKIP bashing is 'fair game', to imply that UKIP are trying to build the kind of society where you should be allowed to burp in foreigners faces. It's just false. All those other examples of UKIP racism you gave are fine because they ACTUALLY happened.

I'm inclined to agree that the pressing from the front is our enabler.  I've said it a few times this season that with Lambert and Balotelli we're just unable to do that, which leads to us being unable to really exert control over the game.  Our midfield and defense don't do well being the main pressure, it has to start from the front so we can take advantage of the mobility and work rate of our players.  

I didn't expect Markovic to be so effective this season, I really didn't think we'd start seeing good production from him until next season.  I'm so happy he's doing well now, I really like the kid.  I'm a fan of moving him to the right and bringing Moreno on as the left wingback, then pushing Henderson central for Gerrard, for games where we need to rest Stevie.  I think we end up gaining a little bit of attacking strength on the flanks with this and we don't sacrifice defensive solidity through the middle to get it, which is really nice.  We'll also get better impact from Hendo in a central position and he really seems to grow into the role when Gerrard isn't on the pitch with him (this isn't a bad thing, it's actually very awesome that he recognizes the need to take on the extra responsibility and then executes with aplomb).

A GK is definitely our most important target for January IMO.  You can make a big case for a mobile forward to help us press and still provide a goal threat without Sturridge:  

If we scored 1 more goal in every game so far this season we'd have 9 more points and be sitting 5th, tied on points with West Ham but behind them by 3 GD.  By that same token, if we conceded 1 less goal each game all season we'd be sitting 5th tied with West Ham as well, but with a worse GD. For me, the effect of having a stronger defense carries though the attacking play more than the other way around.  Shoring up the back gives us more freedom to attack and can help create more goals indirectly.

I think we have a real nightmare on our hands GK wise.  A good, vocal, intelligent keeper can make a huge change for the good on our entire defense, especially on set pieces where we struggle so much for organization and focus.  I think if you can ring confidence to the back then you can build forward far better, which will indirectly make us better going forward.  We have some immensely talented attacking players in the side right now and the defense is more of a shambles than the attack.

Neither is Islam anything like the same in Bangladesh, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Indonesia or Leicester. 

Buddhism in Tibet or Los Angeles, where it's all lovely, isn't the same as in Burma, where it's currently driving ethnic cleansing. Nor, indeed, is the practice of religion in any of these countries all that similar to what it was 50 or 100 years ago. 

Second, it is also (or really primarily) a container for culture. There are lots of things about being Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu which are like being English, or Italian-American - festivals, music, language, dress, and so on. Trying to wipe out religion would mean extraordinary assaults on people's basic cultural identities which would render the change impossible through sheer hostility, the same sort of hostility you would get if you tried to ban pubs or Christmas. It is a recipe for race war, which is of course what a lot of people who propose it actually want.

false,Nymthae,null,null,"Living - Manchester and Sheffield probably similar in terms of price and quality. The Sheffield halls are lush, but after that private housing basically tends to be equally as shocking wherever you go. I hear London is quite difficult when you're searching for houses (i.e. you need to decide quick) whereas my experience in Sheffield are that you don't need to here, there's plenty of it.

Sports - probably similar at most places, SOAS presumably has sports facilities anywhere and everywhere as it will under the UoL setup so you may not be that close (?). I do archery at Sheffield, and there is definitely a very active Badminton society too. Badminton is going to be standard wherever you go, although archery I don't know. We have our own indoor shooting range at the sports centre in Sheffield, which is certainly handy. Lots of people I know seem to be into climbing around here, and being by the peak district walking is very easy.

Politics - anything ""negative"" or that will lead to conflict or fuss is likely to happen in London. As for the other places, chances are the union has large groups campaigning for various matters if you're interested in getting involved. Otherwise, it probably won't affect you in Edinburgh/Sheffield/Manchester.

Nightlife - if you're not into drinking activities then Manchester might be the preference as the music scene is awesome. I regularly nip over to Manchester for gigs and stuff, plenty happening, and some cute little intimate venues scattered around. London is a clear winner in this field though. I don't know a lot about Edinburgh, it's a big enough city that there should be things happening, but I don't think it's somewhere people would rate up near the top if you asked them to compile a list.

Jobs - Translation probably best in London? Sheffield has a lot of Chinese culture because of the international college here, but I don't know how it compares on Japanese. The union is quite big on supporting international students though. I don't know if you'll really land much of a photography job anywhere, but there's nothing to say you can't set up freelancing wherever you go.

Resources - probably similar in most, to be honest. Hard to quantify without specifics. We have a 24 hr library in Sheffield though so what more do you need! :D it's really easy to study languages outside of your course at Sheffield, no idea about elsewhere but it ought to be relatively accessible wherever you are.

Football - pretty sure tickets @ Hillsborough would be easy enough to get in Sheffield, Manchester is probably harder but I dunno, doubt it's impossible but just not necessarily cheap at all. 

Photography - don't know a lot about the facilities. You can probably find the society contacts on the university pages though and ask them!

From your post it kind of sounds to me that you'd be pretty set in Manchester really. All the universities are decent, and I wouldn't rule out SOAS technically because they will never be on the same page as they're much more specialist in a fairly niche area. Financially though, you'd be significantly better off avoiding London. Manchester is a great university, and the city has a lot going for it. 

I don't think you can really go too wrong, if i'm honest. If you want to visit your friends then Edinburgh might be a bit far [at least ~5 hr journey one way].

Not in my experience. Both are generally considered comparable in Britain, but Edinburgh is slightly more respected, being an ancient university and all.

About the same imho, but depends what you're into. Manchester does have cheaper / more studenty clubs, whilst the Edinburgh scene is more upmarket.

Part of it will also be the belief that clubs of a certain....um, stature, shall we say....shouldn't be caught shopping for talent in the lower leagues.  Charlie Austin was a solid signing for QPR but anyone inside the top half of the table would be seen as foolish to pay £9m for a ""Championship Quality"" striker when they can spend ""a little more"" and get a young talent from overseas as it shows more ""ambition"".

I think part of it will also come from the sheer familiarity of the player....unless a player in the Championship (or lower) is a identified ""rising star"" (say Will Hughes from Derby or Demarai Gray from BCFC) people tend to feel they have a pretty good read on the abilities of the player and whether they can make it in the PL or not (at least in their opinion).

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"My take on this: It very much depends on the formation.  When we play as the 2 deep midfielders in the 4-2-3-1 it doesn't work because they're both not very mobile, Gerrard is positionally undisciplined in the deeper role (lapses in concentration, especially in tracking his man and defensive positioning), and they have very limited help coming from elsewhere.  The 4-2-3-1 is very static and forces those 2 deep players to be the ones fighting the vast majority of the midfield battle.  With 2 immobile players in there they'll always be overrun by a 3 man midfield.  Similarly in the diamond, you can't play Lucas as one of the runners because he's too slow and doesn't contribute well to the attack.  You also can't play Gerrard as a runner because he's too slow and won't recover properly to defend.  This makes the midfield really unbalanced when they play together in the diamond (unless Gerrard plays as the attacking top of the diamond, but we sacrifice the press a bit to do that).

In the 3-4-3 we've been playing now, the 2 wider players in the 3 (Coutinho and Lallana lately) pinch in and back track quite a lot, which really helps handle the transitions that catch Lucas/Gerrard out so badly.  When there's an extra body in the midfield like that (you can usually see one of Lallana/Coutinho coming straight back into the midfield to defend when we lose the ball, whichever one isn't on the side that needs to press drops in) and help shield them.  

Lucas's return to form and fitness is making a big difference too.  It looks like his understanding with Gerrard is vastly improved, he's become very good at keeping track of Stevie and knowing where to sit in behind him when he goes forward.  This is an important piece of the puzzle as now when Gerrard decides to push up there's not a gaping hole where he was, there's Lucas instead.  3 at the back is a huge help in letting this happen too, one of the CBs can also step up to take the space Gerrard leaves and help stop the transition if Lucas is unable to shift quickly for whatever reason.

Rodgers has landed on a formation that seems to allow Lucas to protect the team from Gerrard's weaknesses as a deep player without giving up the press because he more or less lets Gerrard roam through the midfield with Lucas next to/just behind him and then Coutinho and Lallana dropping in next to him (depending on which side needs to press and which one doesn't) to make a compact 3 person midfield while defending.  As we transition we have great outlets wide with the wingbacks (Markovic in particular in the past couple of games has looked really dangerous), as well as Lallana and Coutinho who are very good at buzzing into little spaces and Sterling looking to stretch play out and make room between the opposing defense and midfield to play in.",0,1419362019,null,0,false,0,cn3hyhq,t3_2q74b2,t1_cn3hyhq,t3_2q74b2,null,1425250014,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

&gt;When mainstream politics and politicians start declaring that it's fine to use the word 'ch***y' or that every minor problem in the world, such as a traffic jam, can be blamed on foreigners, or that the sole cause of problems with infrastructure is immigration, then racism is legitimised.

&gt;When their candidates refer to gay people as 'poofters' and and Asians as 'ch***ys' or when the leader of the third highest polling party in Britain says he'd be worried if Romanians moved in next door, or that it's fine to wear black-face then racism is legitmised.
Or how about when a UKIP candidate said that Lenny Henry should emigrate to a 'black country', and another candidate referred to Islam as, ""organised crime under religious camouflage"" and then likened it to Nazism.

Some drugs have positive effects on driving, e.g. cocaine increases reaction times and focuses the mind, any drug banned from the Olympics would perhaps fit this category (may be bad for the individual but good for their driving).

The chairman's office people were quite effective with us (we were yet another shit BT department). They used to call us and basically order us to fix the problem and demand an update once it was fixed - so rather than some front line phone-jockey fixing it, a supervisor in our department would have to take ownership of the problem and deal with it and then send an email to the chairman's office person saying it was fixed. If they didn't then after a few days that chairman's office person would call back and want to speak to that supervisor to know why it wasn't fixed

You need to have a complaint that is actually valid though. Like a long term problem that they've fucked up.

&gt; If the council wants to clamp or tow away a car, they should issue a Penalty Charge Notice first. They should only clamp or tow away once they've made sure you are someone who's persistently broken the parking rules.

 [**Sweater curse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater%20curse): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The ""__sweater [curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse)__"" or ""__curse of the love sweater__"" is a term used by [knitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitting) to describe the belief that if a knitter gives a hand-knit sweater to a [significant other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_other), it will lead to the recipient [breaking up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_breakup) with the knitter.  In an alternative formulation, the relationship will end before the sweater is even completed.  The belief is widely discussed in knitting publications, and some knitters claim to have experienced it.    In a 2005 poll, 15% of active knitters said that they had experienced the sweater curse firsthand, and 41% considered it a possibility that should be taken seriously.

false,zen_stoic,null,null,"Well done on finishing your undergraduate degree with no debt. You're in a fortunate position. I can give you some generic advice that should help you with your future financial goals. I'm not a financial advisor, just a normal guy who works a normal job and tries to live a fairly minimalist lifestyle, so don't take my advice on investing as gospel. Do your own research.

&amp;nbsp;

My standard 5 recommendations for mastering your own finances are;

1. Track your spending
2. Spend less than you earn
3. Save up an emergency fund
4. Aggressively pay off existing debt, and avoid future debt like the plague it is.
5. Save for the future.

I’m going to elaborate on these points below. If you want advice about your original question, regarding investing, then you should skip to step 5 below, but I hope you’ll find the other steps useful too. Wall of text incoming.

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Track your spending**

This is the foundation of your mastery of personal finance. If you have no idea what your earnings and expenses are, you have no idea what your money is doing. There are a number of ways to do this. I started off with a simple Excel spreadsheet, which was great at showing me where my money had gone. It served me really well for a year or so. Then I (re)discovered YNAB, and it changed the game completely for me. It let me predict where my money was going to go, and budget accordingly. I cannot recommend YNAB highly enough. You can usually find it for a discount during Steam sales, or their website has a way to get it for free if you’re a student (I think). There are other apps and services available, so see what works for you.  

&amp;nbsp;



**2. Spend less than you earn.**

You’ve made a good start at this, since you’ve managed to finish undergraduate studies without debt. The key to good personal finance is to keep your expenditure below your income. This applies at all levels. It doesn’t matter whether you earn £20k per year, or £2 million, if you spend so much as a pound more, then you will end up on the road to poverty. Remember the Micawber Principle.  

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Save up an emergency fund.**

This is your “Oh shit!” money. This is what keeps you going if/when your (financial) world comes crashing down. The accepted wisdom is that it needs to be equal to three months of your salary. (Some people go for six, or even twelve months. What you do depends on how financially secure you feel, but three months is a good starting point.) If you don’t yet have a consistent salary, then look at your average monthly expenses, (which, as a diligent practitioner of step 1, will be easy for you), and save enough to cover three months expenses. Put this in an easily accessible savings account. Don’t invest this money in equities or commodities or property, or lock it away in bonds or other products. It needs to be there for you, accessible at a moment’s notice, no matter what happens. Depending on your expenses and savings rate, this step alone may take you a year or two, although if you’re really motivated you could do it much sooner. Once you have it, leave it alone, except for dire emergencies. Its not to be used to have a really fun week in most UK cities, or to have a really fun weekend in London. Its not to be used for holidays, or clothes, or the latest gadgets, or cars. Its your “Oh shit!” money.  

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Aggressively pay off existing debt, and avoid future debt like the plague it is.**

Debt is poison. You are indenturing your future self to fund some rich banker’s summer house in the South of France. Don’t do it. If you don’t have the money to buy something right now, then you don’t buy it. Its really that simple. If its something you absolutely need to have, then you can save up for it over a period of time, and by the time you’ve saved enough, hopefully enough time will have passed and your desire for this piece of consumer crap will have faded. This applies to all forms of debt, and all forms of purchasable goods, with the exception of a mortgage for a house.  

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Save for the future.**

Think of your money as your own private army of workers. If you spend it all recklessly, then you just give away your workforce to others. You will obtain temporary gratification with your purchases, but long lasting (financial) happiness, will elude you. Remember these words, often misattributed to the Buddha; “Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” The same applies to most things available for purchase in our society. Big houses, fast cars, fancy clothes, shiny new gadgets, food, alcohol, recreational drugs, etc are all methods people use to achieve instant gratification. The trouble is, they are steps on the hedonic treadmill, and once you start running on that treadmill, it is very difficult to make yourself stop. They will not bring you any meaningful, long-lasting happiness. (This isn’t just my opinion by the way. This is based on honest to goodness scientific research.)  
So, instead of giving away your workers, put them to work for you. Get them to attract more workers to yourself. This involves generating passive income. There are numerous ways. Private businesses, property lettings, and investing come to mind. Investing is the method I am most familiar with. Not being a qualified financial advisor, and not knowing your exact financial circumstances, I am not well suited to giving you advice about which funds to go for.  

&amp;nbsp;

However, I can tell you what I do, as a guy in his early thirties working in a professional capacity with a reasonably well paying job.  

&amp;nbsp;

After having (mostly) achieved steps 1 through 4, I save a monthly sum of money into a Stocks and Shares ISA, with a relatively well known UK online broker. The majority of my contribution goes into a large, low cost, well diversified index tracker, the Vanguard Lifestrategy 80% equity fund (accumulation shares). Vanguard and its founder, Jack Bogle, pioneered index investing in the USA, and they’ve built up a great deal of goodwill since on both sides of the pond. A smaller sum goes into buying shares in the City of London Investment Trust, which has an excellent record of consistent performance over decades, and importantly, is also very low cost. I have a direct debit depositing money into the account each month, with automatic purchases of both fund and investment trust on a set date, and I update my spreadsheet and YNAB once a month. Beyond that I try and ignore what the market is doing. This, for me, is 20-30 year money. So if all goes well, I will not be touching it for at least two decades. Over time, I hope this portfolio will manage an annualised return of around 7%. Which should compound to a healthy lump sum at the end of it all.  

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this was useful. Feel free to message me if you have any questions, or ask them in this thread. Remember, no one is better motivated to take care of your money than you are.

false,Blubbey,null,null,"Depends how many is ""enough"" and what you want. They can all play the holding role, not sure about destroyer, Dembele/Mason/Stam seem to have the edge going forward in the typical centre mid role. Mousa can glide past people, holds onto the ball well, has a reasonable pass but generally seems reserved. He can get forward, he can take a man on, he can play some beautiful passes, he can strike the ball well but he rarely does. Dem has a lot of potential but rarely does what he can and is inconsistent. Frustrating because he could definitely be the player to lock down the position.

Mason seems to get stuck in a little more, is more aggressive,  at the weekend was getting forward more (injured in the box after all, surging run), is a little younger than most. Supports the club too, possibly adds a bit of something else. Worried about his attitude though, he puts it about a bit and that could definitely get him in trouble. Need to see more. Probably the most likely to take a shot on the edge.

Stam has pretty good feet, is quite good going forward, seems to be a good passer and can get stuck in. Can take a man on in need too. Have seen him lose out in a few 50/50s though and I'm not convinced on him getting back.

Cap has played well, especially before his first injury last year. Had some injuries but generally good. Honestly not sure what else to write, he's a solid player with no glaring issues from what I remember.

Paulinho's a different type of player, it looks like he wants to get forward (arguably the most attack minded when left to do what he does), provide the extra man in the box. Easily the most likely to score out of all the others. I may be misremembering but he also played very well as a more defensive minded midfielder in the confed cup. Drops far too deep to pick the ball up though, by far my biggest complaint.

Bentaleb, by far the youngest, great potential. Like everyone else he has a good pass on him, middle of the pack attacking wise in this role. Can hold reasonably well.

All have potential, all can be good if used right. Seems like Paul's the odd one out because we don't use that role he seems to play/want to play. 

If I were to want two based purely on potential I'd pick Dembele and Cap. Right now assuming no injuries? Pfff.... Not much harm giving Mason and Bentaleb more time.",0,1419369668,null,0,1419370841,0,cn3m206,t3_2q7fir,t1_cn3m206,t3_2q7fir,null,1425247880,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

He was probably arrested for committing an offence of sending a grossly offensive communication: A person is guilty if he ""*sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character*"" Also we don't know if he's sent additional private messages to people that aren't in the public domain.

Now a lot of people commenting don't understand what it means to be arrested, and this is totally understandable because I didn't until I became a police officer. Being arrested is just an administrative process, albeit one that restricts your liberty.

Under Code G of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act we can't just go and arrest anyone because we feel like it or because we suspect them to have committed a crime. If we do, sue your local chief constable, you'll probably win £££.
  
Code G says that we need to believe it necessary to arrest someone, i.e. we couldn't deal with the investigation another way. The necessities that we can use are as follows:
  
*  To enable the name or address of the person to be ascertained. (Probably not applicable here as his name is on twitter)
 
* To prevent them causing physical injury to themselves or another person (Could be applicable here if he's made threats or has a history of self harm)
 
* To prevent them suffering physical injury (Almost certainly applicable here as he's probably received a bunch of credible threats as a result of his tweet)
  
* To prevent them causing loss or damage to property (Might be relevant. The police might want to have a look at his phone or computer that he sent the tweet on.)
  
* To prevent them committing an offence against public decency (Applicable here as while he's under arrest he won't be sending out more offensive tweets)
  
* To prevent them causing an obstruction to the highway (N/A)
  
* To protect a child or vulnerable person from the person in question (probably not applicable here)
  
* To allow for the prompt and effective investigation of the offence in question. (Probably applicable, includes interviewing the suspect where there's a concern he might not turn up to a voluntary interview,  or if it's thought there might be a risk of witness intimidation or loss or damage of evidence)
  
* To prevent the investigation being hindered by the disappearance of the person in question. (Might be relevant, we don't know his criminal history, maybe he runs off all the time.)
  
By law, with the exception of a few offences such as drink driving, if you are arrested the police **must** inform you of the necessity of the arrest, from the list above. If they don't, it's probably an unlawful arrest and you stand to win megabucks the longer you're kept unlawfully detained for.

**TLDR**
The arrest was probably necessary to protect him and stop him sending further offensive tweets.",0,1419371435,null,0,false,0,cn3myga,t3_2q6hul,t1_cn3myga,t3_2q6hul,null,1425247355,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

You can easily find out the current CEOs name.

I would assume that the combination is name.surname@bt.com.

Here are the board of directors - http://btplc.com/thegroup/ourcompany/theboard/ourboard/index.htm

I would highly recommend also contacting the non-executive directors. They are not actual employees, and so will give little shit about your issue, but also will not want to be seen to be in neglect of their duties as [custodians of the governance process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-executive_director), for which they probably receive a handsome salary for little actual work.

If you get yourself on their radar, they will pass messages along to the executive directors - who will listen, because the non-executives are essentially executive level HR. 

From there you will be put through to the Executive Level complaints team, whose job it is to make things right and find a way to appease you. After all, if you feel so aggrieved that you have contacted the board, and all the NXDs, then why wouldn't your next step be a newspaper or blog.

Any issue can be fixed with the click of the right persons fingers, but the problem is getting it in front of the right person.

false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,"Heh. BT's customer support is shocking.

I remember when I got 8 Mbps ADSL from them. All signed up and ready to go, modem arrived, plugged in. Connected at 512 kbps. 

Ring them up, get through to India. ""Hi. I'm only getting 512 kbps, is this right?"" ""Yes. It's fine. It takes 10-14 days for the line to settle down"". ""I know that, but surely it should be better than that"". ""No. Don't worry. It takes 10 days to settle down"".

10 days later, it's still at 512 kbps. ""Hi. I'm only getting 512 kbps. Is something wrong?"" ""You need to wait 14 days, sir"".

4 days later, it's still at 512 kbps. This time I get through to Geordie-land ""Hi. I'm still only getting 512 kbps. Is something wrong?"" ""You don't have an 8 Mbps account. You are only on a 512 kbps service, what makes you think you should be getting 8 Mbps"". ""Umm. My order, number XXXXXXXX, says 8 Mbps on it"". ""Hmm. That order doesn't exist. I'll get it actioned. It'll be about another 7 days, because it's a new order.""

5 days later. I start getting 2 Mbps. I wait another 10 days, and it's still at 2 Mbps (well, 2 Mbps throughput - The modem stats are a full 8 Mbps with almost zero errors. Not surprising as I lived opposite the road from the telephone exchange).  ""Hi. I'm only getting 2 Mbps. Is this right?"" ""You need to try rebooting your modem"".

No help. Cue a further 27 phone calls, eventually culminating in ""You need to contact a computer network engineer."" ""No. You don't understand. I AM a computer network engineer. The problem is on your end."" ""Well. I'm sorry. There is nothing more we can do for you.""

I contact a number of support technicians at other ISPS who resell the BT 8 Mbps ADSL, and they all confirm that this is a classic case of the ""stuck line profile"" bug - a bug so common, that 1st level tech support has a button on their home screen saying ""reset line profile"".

I then write a formal complaint talking about poor training of the support staff, and how this is a very well known bug in the BT ADSLMax service, known as the ""stuck line profile"". 

A week later I get a reply to my complaint. ""Have you tried rebooting your modem?""

I write to executive complaints about the handling of the complaint. They apologise, and then forward the complaint onto 1st level tech support. A week later I get another reply. ""Can you check if the green ADSL light on your modem is on?""

I then make a further complaint asking for a refund, or for the contract to be terminated due to breach of contract by BT. They refuse.

At this point, knowing that I'm not going to get anywhere with BT. i decide to take matters into my own hands. From my research I had worked out that the ""stuck line profile"" bug occurred on top quality lines. if during the 10 day training period, the line is so good, that it never drops out, then the line profile will never be calibrated, as calibration is only started by a line drop. So, I found the box where the phone wires came in, and filled it with bleach, which promptly corroded all the wires until there was pretty much nothing left. This completely killed the line. So I logged a fault with the regular BT team, who identified the problem as a leaky and corroded line box and replaced it.

That period of poor line quality prior to total death was all I needed to trigger a line profile reset, and after 2 days stuck at 64 kbps, the line profile readjusted and I got the full 8 Mbps.

Skin type: Dehydrated (before and after starting treatment outlined below), Blemish prone.

I've recently been prescribed Duac gel by my GP which is 1% Clindamycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide. It is working fabulously for my acne however before this I was only using 2.5% benzoyl peroxide so the side effect of dryness has increased. When I used 2.5% I used Eucerin 5% Urea cream (then a layer of vasaline) which stopped any dryness however I'm now not sure if it is enough. My question is, has anyone found or know of any cream that is more moisturising than Eucerin 5%? At the moment I am just surviving by applying a layer, waiting 5minutes for my skin to suck it all away and then applying another layer followed by vasaline. I also find it better to apply Duac every other day but would love to step it up if I can find a stronger moisturiser. 

Anyone else have a similar experience or can recommend a great moisturiser? Any help most welcome!

&gt; 
&gt; The winners got around Eighties remains unsurpassed: European Cup Winners Cup (against the Real Madrid ), European Supercup (against Hamburg ), three league titles, four Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. All without the means of the Old Firm and even less English clubs but with young Scottish shaped by Ferguson and Archie Knox , his assistant (1980/1983 and 1986) who had followed him at Old Trafford.
&gt; 
&gt; *Gordon Strachan: ""It was Real Madrid for the love of God! We beat Bayern Munich and Hamburg in two games. I think we were the best team in Europe at that time ""*
&gt; 
&gt; ""It was Real Madrid for the love of God! We beat Bayern Munich and Hamburg in two games. I think we were the best team in Europe at that time, "" says Gordon Strachan , winger nicknamed ""the wee ginger man"" (the little redhead), in the book Glory in Gothenburg. ""When I look at a photo this group, I say: ""Legendary! ""When I look at the players individually, I think:"" That's my buddy, there Dingus ( Mark McGhee , striker), he eats too much. There Willie ( Miller , Captain), it is as bald as a billiard ball. There are big Alex ( McLeish , central defender) ... ""
&gt; 

&gt; ###The wealth of Aberdeen, the galleys of Dundee
&gt; An hour and a half south of Aberdeen, Dundee throne beside the sea. The fourth largest city in the country (about 150 000 inhabitants), famous for its marmalade and his statue celebrating ""  Desperate Dan  ""character comics renowned British to be the strongest man in the world with a gargantuan appetite, however it does not count the riches of his rival.
&gt; 
&gt; At Aberdeen oil, millionaires (second concentration after London throughout the United Kingdom) and livestock in its hinterland, the Dundee antiquated industry and an unemployment rate three times higher (about 6.5% against 2.2% in Aberdeen).
&gt; 
&gt; *2.2% unemployment in Aberdeen, the second city of the UK as the most millionaires behind London against 6.5% unemployment in Dundee and houses graying*
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately, his football clubs, in the same street, bring some happiness to this graying city, the harbor front and the city center near the coast have nothing to do with seedy neighborhoods adjacent stages.
&gt; 
&gt; In the 80s, Jim McLean had managed to place Dundee on a map. With United, he had won a title, two League Cup, losing in the final of the UEFA 1987 and finished semi-finalist of the Champions League in 1984, losing against the Roma .
&gt; 
&gt;### The Red Final, the Aberdeen fanzine
&gt; ""The Red Final,"" black and white fanzine existing since 1993
&gt; Thirty years. Thirty years the monotony of Old Firm has reasserted itself in Scotland. Desperate investments (Aberdeen, Hibernian, Dundee United), mafia owners (Romanov at Hearts ), or an unexpected slump in the hierarchy ( Dunfermline ) weakened the national football. Oddly, this is partly due to the bankruptcy in 2009 of the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports, the clubs had to clean: austerity policy, return to training, debt treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; Relegation D4 of Rangers in 2012 highlighted the lack of TV revenues and ticket but paradoxically gave new impetus to all these clubs. ""We do not need them to live,"" slice the seller "" The Red Final "", a fanzine Aberdeen existing since 1993 whose inside pages are black and white. ""Look at all these people in the street, watching the atmosphere, these songs. I'm tired criticism that Scottish football, being told that died without Celtic and Rangers. This is wrong! »
&gt; 
&gt; *Vendor Aberdeen fanzine ""Look what people in the street, look at this atmosphere, these songs. I'm tired criticism that Scottish football, being told that died without Celtic and Rangers. This is wrong! »*
&gt; 
&gt; Half an hour before kickoff, the street is crowded. Dons fans even took a stand of derivatives and the Red Army already sings. The 3,600 places available were sold. ""For us, it is our derby. Team is not really close, apart Inverness , but it's different, it's nicer. »
&gt; 
&gt; Each game also sounded the song:  ""We hate Glasgow Rangers, we hate Celtic too, they're shite! We hate Dundee United, Aberdeen purpose we love you! »
&gt; 

&gt;### ""You're fucking sheep""
&gt; Meanwhile Hibernian (D2), three Scottish clubs are no longer indebted Kilmarnock, Dundee United and Aberdeen, that erased £ 15 million thanks to the investment of the couple Donald , a native of the region. ""The best news for years and years, "" smiled the seller fanzine whose cover shows a ball hung with the inscription ""debts"".
&gt; 
&gt; Local side, the excitement is waiting for you. Thanks to a good start to the season, the Terrors dream of Europe, led by a lively and spectacular play, particularly against attack. Between the Turkish striker, Nadir Ciftci , the Scottish winger Gary Mackay-Steven or goblin Aidan Connolly , yet put in an incubator, talent is raw. The defense may scare, especially on the sides, but Paul Paton takes care of everything in midfield, distributing slaps, as Zaluska, the doorman Celtic he assaulted one night in Glasgow , collecting four weeks of fine without pay.
&gt; 
&gt; *Dundee United count on Paul Paton in the middle. When it does not leave blood on the sidewalk replacing Celtic goalkeeper the Northern Ireland international, who was born in Glasgow, is the key midfield*
&gt; 
&gt; Located in the ""Eddie Thompson Stand"" , I quickly overrun by the power of the kop visitors. The Red Army is reputed to be one of the noisiest of Scotland, Aberdeen is with Heart of Midlothian (D2), based in Edinburgh, the club can get as many fans and supporters across the country outside the two cannibals Glasgow.
&gt; 
&gt; The Arabs, nickname Dundee United fans are eaten. Crushed home. The match has not started and shy  ""You're fucking sheep"" (you're fucking sheep, loving opponents nicknamed the Gifts and) are completely blocked by red. Standing with their scarf, ""Glory, Glory Aberdeen"" resonates. Tannadice Park is silent. The Red Army seems home.
&gt; 
&gt; ###The real Rooney strikes again
&gt; Built in 1883, Tannadice Park is a quaint rickety stage. A large lion club mascot adorns one of the tribunes, while gardens and other crops grow right next to the podium where I installed. 
&gt; In front, a low wall of red brick with tags is dominated by barbed wire fences. From the outside, it is expected more to a youth camp in recovery at a football stadium.
&gt; 
&gt; The interior decor changes. All persons settled in the bottom of the ""Eddie Thompson Stand"" will remain standing during the meeting. ""It is tight here,"" laughs one of my neighbors screaming out loud anthem ""It's United"".
&gt; 
*&gt; ""Oh it's United, 
&gt; They're my own team, 
&gt; It's black and tangerine United, 
&gt; United they're It's my own team, 
&gt; DUFC .... ""*
&gt; 
&gt; I remember sighed when kicking off with this thought:  ""It sends! "" Compact, cramped, warm, the atmosphere of Tannadice Park will never be feverish. Arabs, however, have the habit of getting up as soon as all he managed a breakthrough on one side. Unfortunately, apart from the thundering start of Chris Erskine (27, middle / forward) is dreary plain.
&gt; 
&gt; ###Song of the Aberdeen fans: ""Adam Rooney, he's better than Wayne Rooney Adam! »
&gt; 
&gt; Opposite ... Opposite. As I write this, a slight grin crosses my face. Saturday I took a slap. I had never heard an audience roar so. Power, vehemence, the Aberdeen fans to the team's image built by Alex Ferguson in the 80 Always bitching, get up, clapping his, jump, sing.
&gt; 
&gt; In the gallery and a half allocated by the locals, you should have seen the number of people taking the melodies, especially for Adam Rooney , Irish striker who has crashed Oldham (English D3) before returning to Scotland (he had shone Inverness) this winter: ""Adam Rooney, he's better than Wayne Rooney Adam! »
&gt; 
&gt; Double striker Rooney is a real generosity of monster. Front, left, back to goal, in the air, he fights. Same story for the other irish , Jonny Hayes , wandered from post to post and tinkers in midfield successfully. But it's not just the fighting spirit among Dandies, no. He has talent. Niall McGinn , Northern Irish winger, for example, has managed an outstanding first period: passing, dribbling, pressing, besides bombs on set pieces. He even hit the post and the bar!

&gt;### Peter Pawlett Baby was No. 1 singles in Scotland
&gt; A demonstration, although the second period was rougher with Mark Reynolds (27) in defensive boss. 0-2, a host of opportunities, dramatic gestures and fervor. The New Firm is the symbol of the revival of Scottish football, the clubs with a history who like to dream of a return to the Eighties. ""We had a bad start, but I think for the future. We dream to return to Europe. Alas, we had the worst draw with Real Sociedad this summer, but for the first time since I do not know how much time I saw my team completely dominate a European game against a good club ( Groningen namely ). I believe "" the seller told me ""The Red Final.""
&gt; 
&gt; After all, supporters have done well to make ""Peter Pawlett Baby"" the best-selling single in Scotland for a week. Peter Pawlett  ? A midfielder of 23 years formed the club, darling of the fans. They have remixed the refrain ""Do not You Want Me"" by The Human League in ""Peter Pawlett Baby"" .
&gt; 
&gt; The Aberdeen fans organized a campaign for their remix of ""Do not You Want Me"" by The Human League ""Peter Pawlett Baby"" for the song was # 1 top 40 in the UK
&gt; 
&gt; They also organized a campaign after the coronation in Scottish League Cup for this song is # 1 top 40 in the UK. The worst is that ""Peter Pawlett Baby"" was ranked 4 th best selling Download on iTunes March 19 and 1 e in sales of Scottish singles the following week!
&gt; 
&gt; The Human League had confessed to the BBC:  ""For us to wake up this morning by finding"" Do not You Want Me ""in the top 5 of the iTunes singles rankings was absolutely amazing and ranks among the biggest upsets our career [...] As we say in Aberdeen: Reds come on! "" The fans have also invited the group to play the song with the lyrics in praise of Peter Pawlett. Madness, a sweet madness called Red Army.

&gt; 
&gt; ###Dundee United - Aberdeen FC: 0-2
&gt; Rooney 19 th &amp; 33 th
&gt; Attendance: 11,196
&gt; 
&gt; Man of the match
&gt; Niall McGinn deserves praise, as Jonny Hayes, Adam Rooney and Andrew Considine (27 years, formed the club left back), but Mark Reynolds (27, defender) was again brilliant. If balance sometimes key to avoid taking risks, captain in the absence of Russell Anderson is surely the best stopper in the championship. Why Gordon Strachan does not appeal to him selection saw the stampede to this post ? Mystery ..
&gt; 
&gt; ###Ambience
&gt; Calm among Arabs, fusion among Dons. The New Firm is worth a look, really.
&gt; 
&gt; ###Ticket price
&gt; £ 22. Note that the game program, excellent quality, was 3 pounds.
&gt; 
&gt;### Fact of the Day
&gt; ""The Red Final"" fanzine of Aberdeen fans that still exists. ""With the Internet and all media, I find it beautiful"" , told me the seller. Indeed, it's beautiful with sharp analysis, bad faith, sarcasm, drawings and all for £ 1! The worst part is that this person met me on Twitter (how?), And sent me a message thanking me and wish me to understand all with typical expressions of the North East of Scotland .
&gt; 
&gt; ###Quote of the day
&gt; ""Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio! "" The formula to say goodbye to Scotland has been punctuated by fans of Aberdeen chambering their counterparts leaving the stage in injury time.

&gt;UKIP will guarantee those who have served in the Armed Forces for a minimum of 12 years a job in the police force, prison service or border force"" What? Even if they're mentally or physically broken, which is common?

Maybe they'd be less mentally broken with a stable job to go back to. The reason why some go crazy is because they come back from serving somewhere and now they're unemployed, have no money etc.

The speed camera thing genuinely sounds like something this subreddit has asked for many times.

And I'm not an expert (and I'm sure very few people here are), but the ECHR is definitely not perfect, and is frequently used to overturn decisions made in the UK.

And frankly, yes, I'd welcome someone to value law-abiding citizens and victims more.

Since we can't afford to relocate it (which will come with its own problems) the alternatives are disarmament or an inferior alternative (like air launched devices). It's a case of no option being ideal. You are correct to say there is clearly a strong democratic mandate to remove them from Scotland... Should we therefore do that? Not necessarily. A few miles down the road here is a very unpopular sewage treatment plant. Residents hate it because it smells. Should we remove it because there is almost unanimous support from local residents? No. Because as much as I have sympathy for them smelling my shit, I don't really want us to start getting cholera. It's a necessary evil. It is the job of the central government in Westminster to make unpopular choices that are strategically important. Trident is one of them. I'm sympathetic that Scots don't like it. Should it be moved because they don't like it? No.

That said, the English electorate are not going to respond well to labour if they are forced to make concessions to the SNP, which are regarded with total disdain in England. A lot of people in the south already think the referendum and devolution commitment (while preserving the Barnett formula) is overly generous and do not want to see any more concessions made to keep Scotland in the union.

I think labour will do themselves immeasurable harm by being propped up by the SNP, which whilst popular with 2 million scots are absolutely toxic with the 48 million English. I genuinely don't think the Labour Party will support a supply and demand arrangement with the SNP. The truth for them is they **need** those seats in Scotland to win future Westminster elections. Caving to the SNP now will probably only entrench the SNP at their expense. It will mean the only way labour will ever win an election is in coalition which they won't want.

It's also worth pointing out the SNP aren't the lib dems... Whose ambitions beyond electoral reform were fairly limited. Ultimately they lost their opportunity for electoral reform and have spent most of the last 4 years fighting a desperate PR rear-guard action. I think anyone entering into coalition with the SNP would have to recognise their demands are likely to be far less palatable since ultimately their aim of separation is entirely at odds with all 3 Westminster parties... And they'll be in a strong position to effectively blackmail the majority partner... In a way the lib dems weren't.

false,user0verkiller,null,null,"I'm a newcomer to the series so if I say anything wrong I give orders to shoot to kill. With that said, I've watched the newest season of Doctor Who staring Peter Capaldi as The Doctor. Personally I love this Doctor because he was sarcastic, tried to be funny &amp; had chemistry with Clara, his companion at the time. 

After watching the season finale, I decided to watch some episodes from previous Doctors. Watching the First Doctor, I was heartwarmed by the message it portrayed. Most of the special effects are quite amusing to see. One of my favorite story arcs from the First was that they went back in time to Mexico when the aztecs where still at large and the Doctor and his companions are mistaken for gods after exiting a tomb. I laughed at some scenes due to extreme exaggeration portrayed by some actors. 

The second Doctor had one of my favorite story arcs as well, The Tomb of the Cybermen. When the Doctor &amp; his companions go to a distant planet where they find the lost city of the cybermen with a expedition team who mistakes them as a rival expedition team trying to sabotage theirs. It was quite amusing, the cybermats are like zhu-zhu pets &amp; look like they were made by 10 year-olds. 

The Third Doctor was the most comedic I've seen so far. My favorite story arc is after his regeneration where is brought to a hospital &amp; must deal with UNIT. A problem strikes when some meteorites hit the surface &amp; plastic men come to life &amp; wield guns hidden in their hands. It was quite fun to actually see it &amp; want to see it again. 

The Fourth Doctor is definetly my favorite Doctor of the old series. From the long scarf &amp; fedora hat to the metalic companion K-9 &amp; Sarah Jane Smith. My favorite story arc in this one was The Pyramids of Mars. The Doctor goes into play when he researches a supposedly old mansion that's about go to flames and finds an egyptian trying to summon Seth, an egyptian god, who is sealed by Horus's power in Mars. The Doctor disguises himself as a mummy, a transformation scene involving a possessed man who kills his brother &amp; a fight scene between Horus's &amp; Seth's minions. 

I could go on but to sum it up, 9th is indeed good but due to having one-season it was very very over the top. My favorite story arc is Bad Wolf/Parting the Ways. 10th is amazing from being the most like-able Doctor to the most over-the-top fun Doctor. My favorite story arc is Utopia/Sound of Drums. 11th is a very heartwarming Doctor like the Third &amp; has some one of the most tragic episodes ever. My favorite story arc is The Silence Story Arc. 

No matter which Doctor you watch first you always get that sound of hope from the TARDIS &amp; a Doctor with his companions. Watch some of the old ones &amp; you'll find some interesting &amp; heartwarming epsiodes. The new ones stay up from the old but bring new things at the table. The series as a whole can start in any episode &amp; people can catch on &amp; learn new things along the way. It made sure I learned my lesson the hard way. 

You must have read it all, good work, stupendous, molto bene. This is my time to keep watching more of this time-y wime-y show &amp; learn things, impossible things that can inspire anyone to be a Doctor...",0,1419381303,null,0,false,0,cn3rllj,t3_2q5r9n,t1_cn3rllj,t3_2q5r9n,null,1425244556,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;In order to determine how much of a drug would be fatal, scientists came up with a formula known as “lethal dosage.” They then test a substance until 50% of the test animals in the lab die. The formula is known as the LD-50. With this formula, it shows that very small animals such as; rats and mice, can take in as much as 1000mg per kilogram before they die. Larger animals did not even reach the LD-50 even giving them as much as 3000mg per kilogram of body weight.

&gt;What this means is that a person who weighs 140 pounds or about 63 kilograms would need to take in over 4 pounds of marijuana at once to reach the same levels as the large animal study and this still would has not been proven to be a fatal dosage. These studies have been ongoing over 30 years and researchers have yet to see a severe adverse event with the drug.
