true,PoppingFields,null,null,"As other posters here have said, students (including postgrad) tend to live in the Selly Oak/Edgbaston/Harborne areas rather than living in the city centre. Why? Because (as others have said) the city centre is extortionately expensive, and if the vast majority of your time is going to be spent on campus, the commute is not worth it. Secondly, public transport in Birmingham is rather good and the routes between these areas and the city centre are sufficient to satisfy most people's needs for movement between the two. A vast majority of the students of UoB live contentedly in these areas, because it gives them the best of both worlds; quick access to the campus, and quick access to the centre. Furthermore, because most students live in the surrounding areas, you're probably more likely to be near other students if you live there rather than the city centre, making it much easier to go down the pub with your course mates/colleagues. This might taper off a little for older students, but I still know a lot of postgrads who simply stayed near the university.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; BT's service is all well and good when nothing is wrong, but man, I feel your pain.

That's the same with every ISP, I reckon.

I consider technical support to be the number one differentiation between ISPs, but you hardly ever need it, so most people don't realise.

I might pay ¬£5 a month for the higher quality tech support that my ISP gives, and not need it for 2 years at a time.

When I do need it I'm glad that I paid that extra ¬£120 to be able get an engineer booked straight away when I call tech support at 8am on a Monday morning.

With some other ISPs (e.g. TalkTalk, BT), on behalf of my mother and on behalf of customers, I have spent *literally* hours on the phone being jerked around, being told to do things that I know absolutely will not address the problem.

&gt; The only thing I would say is that the grass isn't always greener. Have hopped around a few times either limit for better customer care or a better service, one thing that got me coming back to BT was the fact that when they said we'd get 17 meg out of the line, that's we we got 24/7. We're now on fibre and get 70 all the time. Other providers for whatever reason, were never as good. I left talk talk after 3 months because the speed we got after about 6pm didn't meet the definition of broadband. It was laughable.

I appreciate that you weren't to know, but as someone with experience of lots of UK ISPs, this is what one expects from TalkTalk. 

There are lots of other ISPs mentioned on this page who will give you much better service.

I'm on a (non-BT) FTTC 38Mbps service and I can absolutely saturate it with BitTorrent when the 11pm off-peak hours kick in. 

Having said that, headline speed is not everything - a customer of mine had a second line put in when he switched from the ADSL ISP that I'd recommended to him (and who he'd been with for at least a year or two) to BT Infinity fibre.

Once the BT engineer had done his stuff, he had 2 wifi networks which he could connect to, and he found that webpages loaded noticeably faster on the 3Mbps ADSL service, whereas the BT fibre was 10x faster on Speedtest.net. He tested this a number of times over the following week with consistent results.

Headline speed is only one factor on which to judge your service - at the end of the day a Ferrari and a Fiesta can make the journey between London and Manchester in about the same time, as both are constrained by the speed limit on the motorway. 

When it comes to ""bursty"" driving, however, travelling a few hundred yards or a mile from a standing start, the Ferrari is obviously faster. In real world internet usage, Reddit's homepage html is 116KB in size, and your browser is already rendering it as it waits for images and javascript to arrive. Speedtest.net cannot tell you how latenty your ISP is, because you're reading a webpage's headlines whilst it's still getting warmed up.

If you'd like us playing that way (I'm not sure you do) then you'd need to swap to three CB's because Walker and Townsend pushing forward would require a 3-4-2-1 or the like formation. You'd be too exposed if you played with two wingbacks covering the entire pitch without more defenders to cover.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; from each according to ability etc.

There are two creeds along these lines.  One of which is broadly speaking socialist:

'From each according to their ability, to each according to their labour.'

And one of which is broadly speaking communist:

'From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.'

The first only implies workers getting to determine the manner in which the fruits of their labour are distributed, whereas the latter implies the entire society getting to do so (and generally implies a gift economy).  

**Neither system says that the distribution needs to be exactly equal.**  Only that it has to be democratically determined by either the workers, or the community as a whole.

&gt;the CEO who's worked there for 20 years would own a similar amount to the school dropout who started last month.

This is certainly not the case, and comes from a lack of understanding about what socialism actually is.  Socialism is about the workers democratically owning and controlling their own workplaces.  They could decide to allocate their economic surplus howsoever they chose.  They could even agree to keep current differentials between CEOs and average workers exactly as they are currently, although, of course, it's highly unlikely that they would do so.  However, experience with socialist-structured businesses suggests that exactly equal distributions of resources across all roles are highly unusual except in very small, flat operations with no or very limited division of labour.

&gt; It would also be banned to sell stock to anyone outside the company (as then it would no longer be worker-owned). 

Yup, in this you're correct.  Joint stock corporations are incompatible with socialism because the owners and the workers are no longer the same.  Indeed, SAYE schemes are not really in any genuine sense socialist because whilst they steadily transfer a small portion of ownership to the workers, the vast majority of ownership and realistically and effectively all control is still vested in a separate capitalist class.",0,1397330442,null,0,false,0,cgqr0ha,t3_22unxt,t1_cgqr0ha,t1_cgqpn0f,null,1433325975,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"&gt;  I actually really dislike Dembele that deep, I think he plays with his head down and when receiving a ball takes a snapshot of the field at that moment, beats the 1-2 guys that he thought about beating, but by the time he gets into the final third he lost track of where his teammates went and can't make the pass.

Interesting, it's sort of what other people have been hinting at when discussing Dembele but I really have to disagree, I think Dembele beats players out of necessity because of the lack of options and the lack of teammates who really want the ball. His game would be more about finding advanced players if those players were looking to get on the ball themselves and put themselves in position to receive it but too often this season that's not the case.

Generally his shift of weight and beating people is about creating the necessary space for himself to pick out the pass, I don't think he chooses to release it too late myself.

&gt; Against teams like West Brom I would just rely on Sandro dropping back and CBs willing to go wide to cover. 

I'm not too keen on Sandro being there for extended periods of time, he's not natural there and is positionally off every now and then. 

&gt; I aslo think that we should try reverse-Baling Townsend for the remainder of the season

When you sign up for a service, there are agreements that you make. You not only have a responsibility to yourself to figure out if you can afford the agreement (if you can't, don't agree to it in the first place), you also have a responsibility to abide by the part of the agreement that lists what will happen in the event of non-payment.

In the case of someone having financial difficulties many companies will be happy to adjust terms or sort out a payment plan if you discuss it with them, although I don't know how Virgin manage that or if it's something they offer. However, if you break the terms of an agreement you've made, the other party has the right to enforce the parts of the agreement that come into effect when those terms are broken, and to be honest I can't think of anything more fair.

If you don't like the agreement or think it's unfair, don't sign it. Don't use the service. Discuss altering the terms.

true,TaylorHammond9,null,null,"Ok, well let's talk about your points. Your main problem with the drill is our players mentality, similar to our on the pitch performance (as you said in your first line in the comment I reply'd to).

Was there something wrong with the player's mentality in our last game vs. PSG? If that's bad mentality, good mentality is non-existent. They gave it there all. To compare that to a single, warm up drill is just laughable. It's to get your mind going, and your feet moving fast. That's what these drills were designed for, and that's how they are being used. The peak point for mentality during practice is not the first warm up drill, it is the middle of an intense workout, or a scrimmage. The mentality during this drill has nothing to do with the mentality 30-45 minutes later.

I don't really understand the fuss you are making. I realize you're referring to our players mentality during our games, but what about it? Our players have great mentality during games (maybe not Rami, he can get hot headed and make terrible decisions on tackling). The last PSG game is exactly what I'm talking about.

There's nothing wrong with playing FM, and yes I play (strange how you've got me tagged as Macklesfield though! Haven't used them in a long while). It's when you start trying to transition things from FM to real life where it goes wrong. You pointed that out as to what I was referring to, so you realize that.

I tore my ACL two weeks ago at the first practice of the season... I'm going to miss all of this season, and will be back right around mid-season (of highschool) next year. So.... My soccer(football) career is essentially over as I wont get any recognition from colleges for playing half a season of Varsity. It sucks, and I'm in the same position.

true,hungoverseal,null,null,"I like him and his mentality is great. He did fantastically well over the Christmas period with the injury list we had. He's just completely clueless though. 

We should be playing 4-3-3 with a DM and two creative midfielders in the cm3. We should have two goals scoring quick and creative forwards playing off the striker from wide. Lennon shouldn't be anywhere near the side.

Take Chelsea for example. Walker up to that point had been one of our best players of the entire season, so Tim moves him up the wing so now we have a weaker right back playing in Naughton. Kaboul comes back in after not having played, Vertonghen our best CB gets pushed out of position to LB when we have two LB's on the bench. So before we've even started our already shaky defence is now about as arse about tit as it could possibly get. Complete disruption. He then plays the worlds weirdest front 3 of Sig(LAM), Lennon(CAM), Walker (RAM). The players have never seen that before, no one's seen Lennon at CAM, no one knows what Walkers movement is going to be like down the right.

So there we have defenders with no idea who's next to them, no idea whether the person next to them is going to step up or cover, they have no idea who's infront of them. This leads to players having to take more time on the ball and getting caught in possession or making defensive errors and giving chelsea chances to get behind us. And that's just defensively. In attacking terms we were completely and utterly hoping on breaking on Chelsea and Ade or Siggy finishing off some random attack. We had nothing else. And that's why it all went to shit when Chelsea did score. The players knew we had nothing else.

When he first came to us he did have the right idea in a way. Roll the ball in to the forwards feet quickly and support them, make runs past them. For some reason though he's just completely forgotten about that. If he'd kept that up, added a DM to the midfield in a CM3 then he'd have been rosy. It could really have worked. But he doesn't see that at all

The monastery raving looney party stood in a lot of seats, but even if they'd stood in them all it wouldn't have made them any more worthy to be in debates. 

They really didn't. The Monster Raving Looney managed 27 candidates in 2010 and 19 in 2005. That's nothing near the amount UKIP, the Greens or even the BNP put out.

&gt;The monastery raving looney party stood in a lot of seats, but even if they'd stood in them all it wouldn't have made them any more worthy to be in debates. 

No, but that's because they tend to get 0.2% and also are not serious at all.

&gt;The BNP has had good poll results in the past. At election such polls get shown to be rubbish.

They have, and the good results did show in local elections and European elections. The first past the post system discourages people from voting for smaller candidates because of the concept of a wasted vote. Most people congregate towards Labour and Conservative primarily to avoid the other getting it. 

&gt;If UKIP start actually winning 10% of seats, then maybe they can be considered for the debates.

Such requirements stultify the system to always favour the main two parties which has the effect of inhibiting discussion on the issue to just the talking points of the main two. I would like for there each election time to be lots of debates with UKIP &amp; Green taking part. Regional debates where SNP, Plaid etc take part.

Sherwood has been playing Eriksen out wide. This has led to a lot of attacking success for Eriksen, but leaves Rose extremely exposed. Rose is being asked to provide all of the width on the left, as well as defend, usually without a true holding midfielder for support. This isn't meant to be an excuse (like I said, he has been bad), but I think it does make it a little more understandable.

I think it's clear that we need another left back, but I don't think we need to rush out and spend big on an established one. I would be content to buy a young promising left back and let him and Rose battle it out for the starting spot.

To me, the two things that Rose needs more than anything are competition and a manager with a cohesive defensive plan.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Warning this is an awfully long post; I apologise.

Mentality is an awkward word to describe what I mean but it will suffice for lack of a better word. Although it might be  better not to concentrate on the word specifically. More the idea that our players look only to maintain possession unless they are part of the trio. They are the only ones given license to make a riskier pass that may get intercepted. That's the sort of attitude I mean. Not the fighting spirit kind of attitude but the unwillingness to actually really create their own space rather than just try and exploit whatever the other team leaves. 

Now this brings with it the problem of breaking down teams that are basically looking to frustrate us. They will be compact and minimise the space our quick players have to exploit and minimise the gaps that the other players can surge into or simply shoot from.

When we have the ball with our CBs a player from CM might drop deep and provide a pass but he is usually the sole player moving. He has no new passes or better passes to make. The possession returns to the CB. If the game is more open we see the CM drive up the pitch into space and then usually pass it wider to an AM, or a wide striker for them to cut inside. Alternatively our CM forces it wide to a full back. Who then passes up the line to a wide AM who must cut inside or cross to no-one. The overlap may be on but again rarely crosses, largely because there will be no-one on the end of it. We usually end up with one player moving and many static. This happens far too often to break down a team that defends in numbers. Here we end up being stuck out wide with a lack of presence in the box. Something that shows how ingenious 3 men upfront against PSG was in allowing us to float balls in repeatedly, a massively stark change from the way we started the match. PSG are unlikely to have prepared for such a tactic.

Usually teams that are deliberately compact show how ineffective we can be, we look to lack a cutting edge and we suffer tremendous long range profligacy. The problem, as I see it, is a distinct lack of triangles or willingness to pass and move in conjunction with each other. Something that drills in confined spaces aim to help. We don't move well as a team in attack. Runs are made by individuals. Arsenal started off the season with pretty impressive movement and now look stagnant in attack much like us. Something that every one of my Arsenal supporting mates laments with fervour but to me it almost looks normal, although they do lack a hazard unless Oxlade Chamberlain has a good day.

We suffer the Barcelona problem against teams that are nowhere near as good as us in blocking out space simply because we fail to create our own through movement. If anything, it is typified by the way we attack against a team who don't want possession. Our players get in each others way, the Barcelona of old, when at their best, were able to see a way to create space immediately. By all means Barcelona and teams like them have their faults but we cannot be as rigid in attack or unwilling to move.

It is an example of why I worry about facing athletico more than pretty much any other team in the competition. They can be highly defensively organised but attack extremely well too. [This video perhaps clears up a lot of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fjvJj9Xqjw). I keep calling passes third order which is probably incorrect, this video calls them third line. This is a [fairly ok video on triangles.](http://youtu.be/lGuaQ1khn2k) But I'm sure you're familiar with the concept. This is the [best video I've seen of it recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XexrjsolWLc). Shows movement with triangles far better.

I've seen several chelsea training sessions where they do a [similar game to this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAKWQvaodBI) not specifically for triangles though. Usually done with more players when I've seen Chelsea do it (I think it was largely under Ancelotti though).

Right now we don't really have a clear attacking style. Apart from a counter attack. Particularly when Oscar has to be utilised more defensively. Also Willian has been used centrally to give the legs backwards and forwards to facilitate more effective countering with a defensive responsibility. [This video goes some way to explaining why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It5YCDtXKjE). The stepping up of opposition full backs is particularly important in teams that expect to play versus those who are ok/planned without possession.

&gt;The report noted that the number of interception warrants issued in 2013 was 19% less compared to the earlier year, and the number of authorisations for communication data requests also dropped to 514,608 than 570,135 in 2012.

&gt;Majority of authorisations were granted to Police and law enforcement agencies, with only 11.5% being granted to the intelligence agencies.

The most sensible thing ever said about Danny Rose.

He's not a LB. He's far better when playing like he's a wing back and doesn't have to cover so far back side on defence. If we played a 5-3-2 or something he'd be a remarkable player to have, but we dont' so we ought to sell him if we can secure a replacement.

The problem, of course, is that it's rare to see a top-5 club in any league play with wing backs so he probably won't ever live up to his ful potential as a footballer, and that makes me sad.",0,1397340428,null,0,false,0,cgquji0,t3_22v391,t1_cgquji0,t1_cgqsuld,null,1433327638,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

When the program went on to say that part of the problem with porn is to do with the very poor quality of sex education available in schools, thus is again something that I agree with. At my school sex education was little more than some crudely drawn pictures of genitalia and putting a condom on a banana which to be honest isn't brilliant education when it comes to sex so is it really surprising that children learn more from porn than schools on this issue.

In a family with two workers (and hence presumably children too) you could expect comfortably more than this.  Do recall the average age for a worker is 40 \[[2](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/06/self-employed-worker-numbers-soar-uk)\].  You can very much hope 40 year olds with their 20+ years experience can at least save just 10% of their salary.

Those who've been here awhile may remember some of the replies garnered when a few of us protested against various snooping acts Westminster and Brussels were contemplating. Allowing an MP a written response will always produce a more fudged version of the answer than a live interview, because they've more time to prepare. 

If you want attention to be drawn to something, your best bet is to find a sympathetic paper that will do so. As evinced by events this week, the press can and do get politicians fired. Work out which paper's readers are most likely to care about that issue, and fire off a letter.

The Millions we regularly hear of spent on security and policing is divvied out between the Police, Judges, Lawyers, solicitors and barristers. Many people have lived a very comfortable life off the back of the troubles, it is an industry in itself. You could almost say they had a vested interest in keeping a low level of ""acceptable violence"" to keep the cushy little system in place.

Sectarianism has been used quite deftly in the past by the captains of industry to ensure a divided workforce rendered incapable of organising for better pay and conditions. Sectarianism is being used quite deftly **now** to ensure that there is no cross community action against cuts in public services.

The most recent example of shit stirring is when the UUP and DUP stoked the flames in East Belfast in a blatant electioneering ploy against Alliance and thus the Flag protest was born. Working class Loyalists took the bait, and have been mocked and sneered at ever since. Rest assured if there is mass violence there is always someone pulling the strings and they are more than likely Middle or Upper class.

OP, you may not be used to Reddit, but if you feel like continuing then I am happy to help you mod a new subreddit. I agree that political journalists are well trained, eloquent, and experienced in their job, and a great deal more succinct than I am, but the fact is that they CAN'T ask many of the more cutting questions because of libel, fear of losing their job, and the need to get more politicians to agree to be interviewed. We can fill that gap. 

No, we can't make those bastards always tell the truth - but we CAN make them realise that if they do and try and get away with it, then they are going to get burned, like Nick Clegg after the uni tuition fee pledge debacle.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think Lambert will be sacked this summer unless we lose every game and season ticket sales plummet. Lerner really doesn't want to sack another manager. Understandable, due to the cost of hiring and firing, the perceived ""stability"" brought by sticking with a manager. I would sooner see Lambert go at the end of the season but I doubt it will happen. However, I think the tables are starting to turn and if the current pattern persists he may well be sacked during next season.


I think it's less important who would become manager while those running the club remain the same, because whoever the new manager is...they will likely fail. Getting the wage bill tight is not a football plan. There is no football direction from the board and despite constant arguments to the contrary, there seems to be very little financial support to bring in actual quality players that would make a difference. Whoever the manager is will still be stuck with players that aren't good enough, even if their tactics, motivation and player development might make us a bit better.


More important is looking into a potential new owner. I think that will be the only way we could see meaningful change, because Randy and those that work for him have proven time after time that they will make the wrong decisions and ignore those that try to advise the club. I have lost hope for Lerner's ability to accept his shortcomings and do what is necessary. So this new owner - would they appoint a football director? Would people who really know football be appointed to the board? Who could they get to run the academy? These are the important  questions because all of this is necessary for the club to establish a clear **footballing** vision for the future, not just a **financial** one.


That's when it would really matter who is appointed manager, because they will have to pick one that fits the right philosophy and vision of the club. Which is the opposite to what Lerner has done so far - picking managers that bring their philosophy with them only for it to be abandoned when they leave or get sacked. We require a plan that doesn't rely on one manager, but can be maintained through a string of managers if necessary. The most important decision in Aston Villa's future over the next decade will be Randy Lerner's - who does he sell to, and do they really have the knowledge, cash and guts to do what is necessary?",0,1397350155,null,0,1397351178,0,cgqxyag,t3_22v0xq,t1_cgqxyag,t3_22v0xq,null,1433329312,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2
true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Just to add some clarity to the numbers. There's 600 MPs and each one of the resides over a constituency of between 50 thousand and 70 thousand people. 

The problem I think is not to do with whether or not the electorate wants it, it's to do with where the people who want it are placed. For instance, the liberal democrats have 20 percent of the vote and 50 MPs in parliament, where as the Conservatives have 30% of the vote but *300* MPs in Parliament. This is because Lib Dem supporters are thinly spread all throughout the country and so are only concentrated in enough in certain areas to pose a leadership threat. This is partly why some political theorists have hypothosised that people who rent flats will entirely decide who wins the next election, because just a few constituencies (less than 100 of the 600 total) happen to have quite a large population of people living in flats, and those constituencies happen to be marginal. 

Additionally, because the voting system only favours the party with the most votes, but not eh majority of votes, in each constituency it also means that so long as the winning party in each constituency can keep the people who are voting for it voting for it, and ensure the opposition doesn't consume too many of its revivals vote, they'll stay in power forever. For instance, in Conservative voting areas a minority of people might vote conservative (let;s say, 40%) but 35% voted Labour and 10% green. If both of those groups had known the Conservatives had won, they might have decided to stand together and win, because a majority of people in that constituency are really against conservatism. It can end up being even worse in areas where the vote is very split and you get someone with 30% or 20% of the vote representing the entire constituency, even though 80% of people didn't vote for him/her.

Bring in: a good, young CF to complement Kane &amp; Soldado, a young CB, and a solid left back. Maybe a goalie if Archer isn't ready to be number 2.

We have so many players on our books we need to trim our squad down. And we need to be able to fit in all the possible talent we have. I want younger players so that our squad can grow over the next couple years together. Just a few senior players across the squad to provide leadership, with a young core.

I want us to sell Dembele (don't shoot me, it's just an idea) because I think we're pretty stacked in midfield and, even though he's been arguably our best midfielder when he's fit, he's fit less and less now.

 1) His distribution out of the back was poor. He completed so few passes to feet and lost the ball almost every time he won it. 
2) He played as a CB in a line of 5 with a line of four in front of him. So he wasn't tested positionally (No horizontal movement), was rarely caught in 1 vs 1, and had loads of help.
3) He obviously won every header cause he is taller than Messi sitting on Iniesta's shoulders
4) His clearances were erratic and sometimes laid perfectly for an opponent to strike.

I know it is Barca and they press well but I still have higher expectations for a Liverpool CB. Hypia ran half as much and connected with many more passes.

I don't think Brendan will take him back until he learns to accurately release the ball as soon as he wins it. But strong athleticism for sure. I watched the game and I was 100 times more impressed with Allan Nyom (the right back)

&gt;___Chav___, (/Ààt É√¶v/ ___CHAV___) is a [stereotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype) and [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) epithet used in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain).   The stereotype was popularised in the first decade of the 21st century by the British [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media) to refer to an antisocial [youth subculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_subculture) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom).  The Oxford Dictionary defines Chav as an informal British derogatory meaning a young lower-class person who displays brash and loutish behaviour and wears real or imitation designer clothes.

I'd say so, there are a few references to 80s and 90s football players that you might not be familiar with, a lot of the team are caricatures of members of the England team of the late 90s, wiki has a good explanation;

&gt; With a squad featuring a pony-tailed goalkeeper (based on David Seaman); Kevin Tonkinson, an alcoholic Mackem (based on Paul Gascoigne); Rufus Smalls, a striker going through a very poor run of form (based on Andy Cole); Steve Harper, a playboy midfielder (based on David Beckham) and Gary Wackett, an extremely aggressive centre-back (based on Stuart Pearce/Vinnie Jones); 

The thing I love about the film is the way it attacks the closed minded 1970s approach the English FA had and still have to the way football should be played, and the corrupt 'old boys' method of appointing back room staff.  Although the film is 13 years old it's just as relevant today in regards to the FA and England.

&gt;Bassett takes over the England team and appoints his assistant manager Lonnie Urquart (Philip Jackson), who is very old-fashioned in his beliefs and still acts like a used car salesman and often compares the England players' performances to cars, and coach Dave Dodds (Bradley Walsh), a spineless ""yes-man"" who once managed with Mike at Colchester United (a reference to Phil Neal under the Graham Taylor era) 
&gt;He plays an old-fashioned 4-4-2 formation and attempts to bring football back to where it belongs.

Ex Liverpool Barry Venison is in it and Pele has a cameo in what is arguably the funniest scene in the film.

Apparently they're making a sequel too.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"What proof (maybe credentials is the wrong word, you can crucify me on that later) do we have that AVB would've worked out? Putting things on faith isn't enough.Just a simple scenario for you:We're down 2-1 against Southampton at home. AVB is still manager. We have 70% possession but nothing is happening because he's too damn rigid to play Soldado in a free a role as Tim is doing. How many points are we dropping today, you think? At least with Sherwood, we're not getting our best striker frozen out. Without Ade and Eriksen linking up, where are our goals coming from? Because they won't be coming from anywhere in an AVB setup, especially against a team as high pressing as Soton. Why? What did AVB do for Spurs that makes him such a regrettable decision T sack? If it's points tally, we're probably going to be one behind last year's tally. All from a manager who hadn't managed a PL club before, in the toughest season in recent memory. &gt;So if credentials mean nothing to you does that mean you'd prefer a Sherwood over a LVGThis seems to imply that LvG is what everyone wants just because of the clubs he's managed.I'm on my phone right now, but there's a picture of LvG eating dinner with an 11 year old boy at a ceremonial dinner. This product of La Masia ended up at Valencia, where he lit up La Liga for years, and then came back to Barcelona to become one of the world's best left backs and scored in a Euro final. That boy's name is Jordi Alba. Or how about that German kid from Bayern, who got minutes and starting spots because of LvG, going on to win Young Player of the Tournament in FIFA 2010? Does the name of Thomas Mueller sound familiar?Honestly, can you imagine discovering a youth prospect from Tottenham, and then *staying* under AVB? Would we even see him play a few minutes? Because I can see that with LvG, and yeah, even Sherwood. We may have dropped the ball on Taarabt, in hindsight, because that's just what happens when we get managers who don't focus on youth. We shouldn't be getting Van Gaal as a quick fix. We should get him because the club lacks an ideology of youth integration. People run their mouths and make jokes about Bentaleb, but he's getting better. He's got the chance to be solid, if not good.tl;dr-Fuck winning track records, fuck trophy counts, let's see fluidity and style come back to the Lane, along with our up and comers. LvG having a gargantuan stature is secondary to what he'll leave behind. Why do you think so many of want FdB? Have you seen Eriksen, Suarez and Vert?

I made the mistake of going into NatWest when I returned from several years abroad. The 'assistant manager' I had a meeting with was a 22-year-old car salesman in a shiny suit. 

What I was telling him was this: because I'd been away for so long, I had no credit history. Not a bad one, none at all. However in the country where I'd been living my credit rating was stellar - top of the range. So therefore if he insisted on trying to upsell me credit-based products, he would get nowhere, unless he could transfer my rating. But that I'd be prepared take an account with no necessity for credit at all, then slowly build up a credit history with a limited overdraft facility a few months down the line.

He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about.

Blank stare while he fantasised about what he'd do with the ¬£50 commission he earned from selling me the super duper PPI-laden flexi dexi account he was trying to flog me.

Postcodes for the previous 5 years' worth of addresses? ""They don't fit into the box on the screen."" That's because they're from another country. 

After making up some fake UK-style postcodes, he submits an application for the whizzy unnecessary bullshit account that I specifically said I didn't want, then goes off to process my request and comes back with ""I don't understand mate, computer says no. Nuffink I can do for you.""

That's the kind of expertise and attitude that NatWest employ these days. I've never seen a bank that was so clearly desperate to earn money by selling shit that was entirely unrelated to its core functions.

I've only just gotten into football since some college friends who are big Liverpool fans more or less forced me into it the start of this season. It's been a process learning the team and the general environment of international club football basically from scratch, but it's been a real pleasure to watch these guys work their way up to the top of the table over the past few months. And just as a sports fan in general, the way Liverpool diehards support their team is just god damned impressive to me. What a fantastic fanbase.  

I can't recall the last time that I was this excited/anxious for a sporting event that wasn't American football or basketball.

&gt;

&gt;Bavarian [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore) tells of the __wolpertinger__ (also called __wolperdinger__, __poontinger__ or __woiperdinger__), a [mythological hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythological_hybrid) animal allegedly inhabiting the [alpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps) forests of [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany). It has a body comprised from various animal parts ‚Äî generally wings, antlers, tails and fangs, all attached to the body of a small mammal. The most widespread description portrays a horned rabbit or a horned squirrel.

&gt;Stuffed ""wolpertingers"", composed of parts of actual stuffed animals, are often displayed in inns or sold to tourists as souvenirs in the animals' ""native regions"". The [Deutsches Jagd- und Fischereimuseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Jagd-_und_Fischereimuseum) in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich), Germany features a permanent exhibit on the creature.

&gt;It resembles other creatures from German folklore, such as the *Rasselbock* of the [Thuringian Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringian_Forest), or the *[Elwedritsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwedritsche)* of the [Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatinate_(region\)) region, which accounts describe as a chicken-like creature with antlers; additionally the American [Jackalope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackalope) as well as the Swedish [Skvader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skvader) somewhat resemble the wolpertinger. The Austrian counterpart of the wolpertinger is the __raurakl__.

 - On day 1, the price you'll be paying for shares is announced - we were offered the shares at 20% below the opening price on day 1.
 - You pay in every month - once you're committed to it, your payments into the scheme cannot change or be paused. Your only option if you can no longer afford to pay in is to pull all your money out of the scheme in cash.
 - On maturity (usually after three years), your cash is converted into shares at the rate originally agreed and handed over to you. You can then do what you like with them - keep or sell them.
 - If you leave the company part-way through, you can either have your money back or have the number of shares you've paid for so far. (I'm a bit hazy on this detail - it may be that the option to have the shares was only there if you were made redundant).

Besides, half of the time he was just clearing the ball, there is a difference between passing it out from the back and clearing it, his main objective was to get the ball away from danger, and judging by this video he did that superbly.

I actually thought his passing was good btw, when he wasnt clearing it I dont think I saw him misplace a pass. What about all of the last ditch challenges and the blocks?

He smokes and drinks because he's been doing it for 30 years and if he stops now his body might go into shock.

Wanna see a picture of this corporate-well-oiled PR team?   

Without denigrating them, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi or Roland Rudd they are not. The three people on Farage's right:  Patrick O'Flynn (Director of Media), Alex Phillips (Speechwright Ltd. Director), Lizzy Vaid (UKIP Events organizer/PA).  

[The others aren't a PR team as such; ~~Michael Heaver MEP nominee and journalist for the Telegraph~~ &lt;&lt;EDIT:  not sure that's M. Heaver buried under Jack, just a look-a-like and unspectacled Thom Hoof, Dep Chair of YI&gt;&gt;, Head of Policy Tim Aker, and YI Chairman and Treasurer Jack Duffin and Richard Harrington respectively.]    

Farage's PR is very much cottage industry.

As a massive UKIP advocate, 'No'.  It's not going to happen.  Even Farage has said as much.  

What can or may happen is that UKIP take more than the dozen or so it's chairman considers feasible, and not just become King Makers, but essentially Kingslayers.   UKIP can put its now considerable resources into almost any swing seat Labour or Conservative and either party would have to sink ever shrinking coffers into it to retain it.  

People talk about UKIP splitting the Conservative vote.  In the North of England where there is no reality of a Conservative victory but there's Conservative minorities tactical voting now means denying Labour a seat by voting UKIP.  UKIP can run against Labour in 6 swing seats, and make Labour focus their attention, to draw attention from a 7th marginal.

Every party now has to focus its resources.  No one party has financial ubiquity.  However only one party has been campaigning cheap on grassroot community centre politics first, and doing so effectively: UKIP.

They won't win a General Election in 2015 (unless the utterly unseeable happens), but they can well and truly kick the door of 3 party politics off its hinges once and for all, and then politicians will have to start listening - and they will be able to force a few key issues.",0,1397385081,null,0,false,0,cgr78ai,t3_22wudd,t1_cgr78ai,t1_cgr73f6,null,1433333749,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Labour voters up North are switching to UKIP. Labour did fuck all the last time they were in. And of course the North doesn't vote Tory. And Farage is relatable, drinks in pubs and likes eating pies so people up there will vote for him.

I didn't call you a liar in regards to you not having DDs but was inferring you were either a liar and he never said it or he was an idiot in regards to his advice about DDs.

&gt; How am I costing myself money by not using them?

Because utility companies for example give discounts for people paying by direct debit over those who don't. So if I were living next door to you using the same gas/electricity supplier I would be paying less per unit for my gas/electric than you would be. There is actually a specific entry showing the monetary discount I get for paying by direct debit with my supplier. And then there's interest you're losing. By paying ¬£145.50 for your TV license in one lump than paying ¬£12 a month by direct debit you're losing interest on that ¬£145.50.

&gt;  I know how using them cost me a fortune in money and time when they went wrong

Thats because you didn't invoke the Direct Debit Guarantee which is the boring bit they read out to you when you sign up for one.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;And devolved power is key to small government ideas,

But it doesn't have to lead to that, not if they're advocating giving more fiscal powers to local authorities and arguing they retain locally more of what they raise.

&gt;it's the idea that getting rid of services won't matter because they'll be picked up on the local level.

Hang on, UKIP advocate locking NHS spend as a percentage of GDP and are currently the only party of the 4 arguing against NHS privatisation.  Labour and Conservatives have lost that mantle and LibDems in pushing for a ever closer political European Union is contradictory to any NHS protectionism considering ISDS of TTIP.

They also defend against Legal Aid cuts.  Devolving political power to elected NHS county bodies.  Were against privatisation of the Royal Mail.

What is the political elite?  Because UKIP advocates giving more powers to councillors, local police authorities, local SMEs, prison governors, judges, NHS governors, teachers, parents, and taking it from Westminster politicians and the civil service that walk its back corridors.

It's not getting rid of services.  Not getting rid of national taxes, still distributing wealth, but having a lower national tax and then giving local regions tax raising powers.  There's a far healthier left wing attitude in the UK than the US, even if its been spliced out of Westminster - and it's far easier to elect bespoke councils and councillors of a certain persuasion than it is MPs and national parties.

""Socialist local government"" isn't really a thing because local government currently has little power over Westminster, yet left-wing or socialist leaning local representatives do exist.  People are just becoming indifferent to local politics because the tide has for a long time been towards Westminster.

If you want to live in a more altruistic-reappropriation bubble you can still receive national taxes but you could top it up locally and spunk the lot on local services if you elect left leaning councils (which is far easier to achieve).  

There is of course the caveat that some local authorities will be electing more right wing county councils and they're going to be keeping more of their own tax breaks - and you're going to be in competition with them for business, but then that's just a microcosm for the rest of the world.",1,1397391244,null,0,1397391983,0,cgr84jc,t3_22wudd,t1_cgr84jc,t1_cgr7tm1,null,1433334173,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

We shouldn't dislike politicians because of their background. It shouldn't matter if they came from a rich family, if they went to Eton, if they went on a PPE course at Oxford or Cambridge, if they were gifted a high paying consultancy job then given a safe seat to get their foot into politics. 

What we should care about is what they do and think now. I care if a politician lies and exaggerates, if they purposefully mislead the public for their own gain. Often, this is a by-product of a career politician, but there are plenty of non-career politicians who act exactly the same way, and deserve equal scorn. 

I find it funny when people say Farage is refreshing because he's challenging the establishment, because if anything he is more of the same. He lies and exaggerates and withholds information as much as the next politician, and the only reason people see him as different is because he's coming from a slightly different angle and has a good PR team.

So that's a given as being a demand.

So other things that may appear on a UKIP coaltion shopping list might include:

- They are already acting as a pressure group on energy policy, certainly on Conservative policy.  A sovereign wealth fund is a likely achievable goal, postponing closures of existing plants.

- Other things that might be on their shopping list with cross party backbench support: 

- Localism appears under backbench movement Blue Labour, and the Conservative's backbench *Localist Papers*.  Further devolution to county councils or their equivalent.

- Reducing tuition fees with a views to scrapping them if Cameron is no longer in power and if David Davis takes over.

- Protecting Legal Aid is another big one.

- Stopping privatisation of the NHS, or some of its NHS reforms at least making it far more difficult to privatse.  Introducing universal free eye and dental checks, whilst improving NHS bargaining power when dealing with pharmaceuticals.

- Grammar schools could be up there.

- I know 'ATOS' has just waived a contract but the system still needs reform.  Some UKIP reforms like having an NHS doctor involved in all appraisals with a duty to the patient not the company bottom line is a simple reform to introduce, as is allowing claimants to include their own GP's notes on their disability on any assessment is another.

- Scrapping HS2.

- Allowing easier conversion of brown field land for housing.

- Allowing HB to go to landlords to lower rents and make more affordable housing available.

- To stop quota building for small building firms to make cheaper, affordable housing more economically viable for developers.

- Right to recall

What exactly they'll plump for, or how many, really depends on the situation and who're they're negotiating with, and what they think they can get or how they prioritise.

But essentially that's a list of possibly very achievable goals/UKIP policy in coalition.  A big one for me, and probably much more ambitious, would be their Direct Democracy policy, but then again there is support for that in some influential backbenchers like Zac Goldsmith and Douglas Carswell.  It's also going to find support in the Drug Reform/PR referendum crowd.

My problem was an insurance company renewing the insurance on a motorbike that I no longer owned (it had been stolen and the insurance company had paid out, I had bought another identical bike and insured the new one with the same company, then they renewed the old insurance 8 months later without notifying me in any way).

 Because it was a direct debit, they wouldn't give a cash or cheque refund or even credit the money towards my next years insurance, they insisted on reversing the direct debit, apparently that's part of the direct debit contract and they aren't given a choice about it. That was where the problems started, where I ended up having to involve the bank manager. This is apparently where the problems ""always happen"" according to him, something to do with transaction authorisation code.

While all this was still ongoing, I happened across my bank manager in a social setting (I used to do sound engineering for bands, he turned up at a gig I was doing), and we had a good chat. He told me about all the problems he'd personally had with a direct debit, how being a bank manager didn't help him solve them any easier, and how he'd given up direct debits as a result.

Somehow I doubt that a bank manager would tell lies to put a customer off from using one of his banks services. He's no idiot either, or he wouldn't be managing a branch of a major bank in a city. It was quite obvious to me at the time that he was trying to do me a favour by discouraging me from direct debits.

The only business that has recently tried to offer me a discount for direct debit was npower for the electricity to my old workshop. They were also trying to unlawfully force me to abide by a contract whilst refusing to give me access to that contract in a manner required by law, so I wrote them my own contract and granted myself the same discount for cash.

But hey, if the least it achieves is making people more involved in local politics then that's no bad thing either.

It remains however that it is much easier to campaign for changes locally, it's just that currently local representatives don't have much power or say (often having to follow party line).

The last time I was in a Post Office (last week, in fact), there were multiple counters for different services so some for customer service, some for check and send and some again for foreign exchange.

There was a touchscreen with three buttons on it and depending on the service you wanted, you pressed one of three buttons to be issued with the correct ticket.

Good idea, makes sense, no problem with that.

Why then does the Post Office employ someone to *ask* people what service they want and then *press the button for them and hand them the ticket*?

Are we (and it IS we, as Post Office is still Government-owned) seriously paying someone taxpayer's cash in order to stand there all day and press a button for people?

&gt; Apart from when you took out the insurance. My insurance company sent me a letter at the start of the policy saying it would automatically renew unless I contact them.

Are you really that hard for bigcorps that you try to distort my own words back to me, or are you just not reading what I wrote? I had contacted them, I'd contacted them 8 months earlier and told them the bike had been stolen. They had acknowledged by letter **stating that the insurance was cancelled and they would take any remaining payments** they had acknowledged by phone when we discussed the value of the bike and my plans to replace it, and they had acknowledged that I no longer owned the bike by paying me out for the bike as a total loss!!! Insurance company actually admitted it was their error anyway, they processed the reversal of the direct debit straight away, it was the banking system that lost the transaction and turned it into a nightmare for me.

&gt; Its available on their website and you get sent a copy when you choose to sign up and you can choose to cancel that within 14 days.

I never got a copy when I signed up. I never got a copy when I phoned them and asked for a copy, twice. I never got told by them that it was on their website until I was asking for it a 4th time. The copy that is on the website requires that you agree to the cookie policy to view it (despite not actually using a cookie).

If he had his critics (there weren't many on this sub) he's met them so many times over since January. He has played like a man possessed. And this has nothing to do with his goal today. That was fantastic, of course, but it was his defensive work and pressing that was immense.

That Brendan has gotten pure attacking players to play this way is an absolute credit to him. And for the players to find it in themselves to work this hard - because not every club demands that in their playing style - is an amazing thing to see.

Just about getting back into the CL is it?

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"&gt; The problem, of course, is that it's rare to see a top-5 club in any league play with wing backs so he probably won't ever live up to his ful potential as a footballer, and that makes me sad.

What?

Serie A. Fiorentina(last season?), Juve, Napoli (before Benitez came in), Roma (not sure about this season but they did a few seasons ago), Inter, Udinese.

And also with how a lot of the top teams play, you see the likes of Dani Alves for Barca, tell me how he's not a wing back! You haven't got to play 3 at the back like you see in Italy in order to play with wing backs. In fact we essentially do play with wing backs.

I'd also argue he is a LB as when he's played further forward, the necessity to attack has crippled him and he's been less effective as an attacking force than when he played at left back. His defensive work has ranged from wonderful to atrocious this season (people will have forgotten a lot of the good defensive work he did at the start of the season), but we're letting a lot of other players off with poor performances this season and giving them another chance next so idk why a young guy like rose isn't been given one.

What happened on the pitch aside, City have managed to avoid what can happen with an influx of capital and remained a class outfit through and through. 

Your fans were exemplary in observing the minute silence prior to kick-off and the team held up their end of the bargain on the pitch to give all of us the best game of the season.

It's a shame you lost Yaya so early on because losing a man like that will dent any side's chances and it's tough enough to go to Anfield at this end of the season on this of all weekends in these circumstances. Silva and Nasri were fucking tortuous in the second half and I'll concede that Suarez didn't play in the spirit of the game today with the referee being all-round awful but probably ceding the ability to make the right decisions with The Kop blaring at him.

It also seems one issue is based on availability of time and that you're effectively saying you expect people to be doing coding in their free time as well - something that certain demographics won't have. (See last quote below)

&gt; *Further, deciding that someone is a good programmer based solely on their publicly available code excludes far more than marginalized people. It also excludes anyone who can't release their code publicly because of licensing or security reasons. This also includes a large number of freelancers and contractors who are unable to publicly claim that they worked on a project for legal reasons (NDAs, for instance).*

Also, see [Why GitHub is not your CV](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/)

&gt;For a start, GitHub has no way of customising your profile page, and what is shown by default is the projects with the most stars, and the projects you‚Äôve recently pushed to... 

&gt;...So really, your GitHub profile displays two things: how ‚Äòinfluential‚Äô you are, and how easily you can be coerced into constantly working. 

...

&gt; A portfolio is an edited collection of professional and personal work that someone working in the visual arts uses to present their best face to possible clients. It‚Äôs a visual CV, and just like a CV its editing is tailored depending on who you‚Äôre trying to impress. GitHub is not this at all. GitHub is all the public work you‚Äôve ever done, unordered, unfiltered and unexplained. It tells no story and provides no context.

Conclusion to the blog:

&gt; *But James, I hear you cry, you do loads of open source stuff! Why are you complaining?*

&gt; *I‚Äôve got it easy. I‚Äôve led a very privileged life, never had to really worry about money, was given a good education, and have generous parents who made sure I didn‚Äôt need a job while at university, so I could spend the resulting leisure time teaching myself to program. I also have the advantages of being white and male on my side, so I don‚Äôt have to put up with receiving death and rape threats when I put my code online or say things like this. (Yes, this happens.)*

They are not all ""that"" bad. Though the unfortunately it's the Hansard society at the forefront at pushing the move to online. You should check out their work on the [Open Parliament License.](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/copyright/open-parliament-licence/) 

I disagree they don't know about it *or at least their staff* &gt;;). But it's more about making sure it's an environment they will not just get slaughtered in. A few have attempted to jump online, but it's so easy for an opposing party to hijack the thread and create negative publicity. Think of them as a Cat when it comes to publicity, if they are unsure about the environment, or know it is hostile, they will be very hasty to jump straight in. If they know they might get a belly scratch then they will jump right in there.  Not to say you can't ask difficult questions, but more on the lines of not being a slaughter-house.

I would suggest getting some rules into the UKpolitics subreddit that would encourage that kind of MP engagement, maybe get someone impartial to help (Hansard?). Because lets face it, Reddit is demographically going to favor smaller left leaning parties.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"18 year old here. Voting Liberal in the European Elections. The Lib Dems suck at governing. They're genuinely really bad at it. But that was to be expected from a party which had never been in power before and only had 50 MPs compared to the Conservatives 300. However, the Liberal Democrats represent my views much better than any other party. They gave up on tuition fees in power so that they could enact a lot of their other policies, and I am very glad they did. 

Consider what the other two options on the table were. The main alternative is a Lib-Lab coalition, only that wouldn't work because between them they don't have enough MPs to govern with a majority. They'd have to have a coalition between Labour, the liberals and various Northern Ireland, Scottish, Welsh parties which would have made the coalition a nightmare. The Lib-Dems would have been almost completely drowned out amongst all the others and the government would have collapsed by now. 

The third options would be the Conservatives governing with a minority (probably after the Labour, Lib Dem, Northern Irish coalition fell apart) and then enacting pretty much all of their policies without any of the Lib Dem ones. 

There was absolutely no bloody way the Lib Dems were *ever* going to be able to make the government stop raising tuition fees with the amount of MPs they had. The decision they have made have maximised the amount influence the have had on the governance of this country. Aren't you pleased about that? Aren't you pleased that they have enacted about half of their manifesto pledges instead of non of them? You could say they sold out for power, but what the fuck is the point of voting for them if you *don't* want them to try and influence government policy? They did exactly what they were elected to do which is make the government behave as much in line with their manifesto as possible *which they did*.

Another option you might want to consider is flying into Paris then taking the Eurostar into St. Pancras Intl. and then EMT up to Nottingham which is almost like taking a train directly from Paris to Nottingham.

By far the easiest option is flying into Birmingham if you can then taking the train to Nottingham (or coach if it's cheaper).

If you want to fly into East Midlands airport, it's not exactly the most convenient location even for Nottingham because there is no direct train link into Nottingham station which is stupid... but anyway look at the European destinations for FlyBe as they are a budget operator into East Midlands.

That is a bit silly that there's no direct like from EMA to Nottingham.  I had considered actually flying to Glasgow and taking a Flybe flight down there but I may not bother unless I decide to make a day trip of Glasgow.

So, I'd say 45% on mere salary is actually quite reasonable.  Remember that inflation effectively reduces the amount of money being paid in taxation anyway - a net cut.

These villages are then starving because not only have companies just bought a bunch of land for grain production, but also a huge chunk for biofuels.

The downside is that if there's anything that needs fixing, you have to foot the bill, and on houses at the cheaper end of the market there's probably more of a risk of a boiler dying or there being damp or a leaky roof. And there's the risk that house prices will fall and you end up with negative equity.

I suppose one argument of buying over renting is that you effectively cancel out any future inflation in the property market by buying. Your rent will go up over time, whereas the real cost of your mortgage payments should go down due to inflation.  

This applies to the long term, short term there may be better arguments for renting e.g. maintenance costs are included.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"Well here are the calculations for my area for a 1 bed flat:

Cheapest rental 1 bed flat: ¬£490 pcm

Cheapest 1 bed flat for sale: ¬£89,995

With a 90% LTV I can get 4.49% fixed for 2 years. That's ¬£303 of interest per month. 

Then I have to take into account maintenance and ground rent which is about ¬£40 extra per month. 

So ¬£343 per month in outgoings to buy the cheapest flat (which is actually nicer than the cheapest rental by quite a bit).. 

That means I'm about ¬£147 better off each month by buying. Well, not quite. 

It's costing me ¬£1,000 in lawyers too. Over the 2 years of the mortgage that's ¬£41 per month. So I'm only ¬£106 better off per month now. 

And you have to factor in interest lost from not having that ¬£9K deposit in my ISA @ ~2%.. That's another ¬£15 down. 

So I'm about ¬£91 better off per month by buying that flat. However I also believe that house prices will rise in the next two years.. I think at least 7.5%. 

Factor that in, and I'm actually saving myself ¬£372.25 per month by buying rather than renting. 

In reality, I'd never rent the ¬£490pcm place because it's disgusting dive. The next cheapest is about ¬£595 and more like the place I'm buying.

Hope that helps.

I used to think that, but A) if they do we will never hear the fucking end of it, and B) I have a healthy hatred of Suarez and Skrtel, to whom it seems rules in the penalty box just do not apply.

Edit: That sounded pretty bitter, I don't like Liverpool but if they do win it it's gotta be better than Chelsea or Utd again, and as you say regardless of the rest of them I'd be pleased for Gerrard.

That's not true.

Eviction within weeks is unheard of, within 3 months is rare... 6 months is more realistic.

Then I drove her back to her house, we talked in my car. Talked about a few things that had come up in my life, and in her life. When we got there, we talked some more said our goodbyes, hugged, and she went inside.

It wasn't a date to be made into an epic, but I feel it was a good step. She had a nasty breakup not too long ago, and she is still reeling from that. I'm giving her space, and I don't want to pressure her.

She also checked to make sure I got home alright which made me ddddaaaawwwww.

I'm taking her to prom too. So ain't nothing wrong with a little bump and grind :)

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; I'd rather have nuclear power stations. Cheaper per megawatt and they work when it's not windy.

I'm fine with nuclear power, too.  My comment was aimed more at the NIMBYs who write comments like the one I quoted.

Incidentally, offshore wind power (at around ¬£150-¬£210/MWh) is certainly more expensive than nuclear power (at around ¬£80-¬£105/MWh) but onshore wind farms are about the same.(¬£80-¬£110/MWh) ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#UK_2010_estimates)).

It's true that wind farms don't generate power when it's not windy.  But then again, nuclear power stations generate power all the time, even when there's no demand for it.  They're different sides of the same coin.

If you break down, or slice down the profitable parts of, a natural monopoly then you will get large corporates taking over.

If you want that, then great.  If you would rather have the Post Office as a central part of community then it needs the Royal Mail revenue, and in turn Royal Mail if it is going to offer a universal system needs the more profitable routes to offset the less profitable.

It's been hamstrung by EU postal directives to the point where selling it was the only workable viable option without plunging ever ending money into a leaky budget bucket.

&gt;On energy policy I know they oppose tax breaks and subsidies for renewable energy and instead want 'traditional' fossil fuels to be used.

True, in absentia of a Royal Commission on it.  They however do advocate that if a local authority wants to build a windfarm (or have private investors come in), then any tax revenue from it should be theirs.

&gt;Also, the other policies you've mentioned like scrapping tuition fees goes against their 'libertarian' agenda.

Well suck it up, because that's what they advocate.   

And, No.  It does not go against a social libertarian agenda.  We're not Yanks (no offense any wandering American in r/Unitedkingdom).  UKIP is often attacked for being populist, not something I necessarily see as a pejorative.  What it does mean is that it appeals to both left &amp; right.   Being socially libertarian (left) in some regards, whilst economically libertarian (right) in others, is not counter UKIP agenda.  

It is only seen that way when people trying to argue against UKIP try to frame the argument that way.      
A central tenet of UKIP is Direct Democracy with both binding local and national referendums.   So anything with a social or left leaning provision with a democratic and cultural mandate gets the UKIP green light - however reluctantly.  This, I suppose takes us back to their being anti-establishment.

However the commuter travelled from [Stonegate station](http://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Stonegate+station,+East+Sussex/Cannon+Street,+London,+EC4), which is 75 minutes outside London and over halfway to Hastings, on the British Rail network.

Stonegate in the middle of nowhere and I would guess that the station buildings you can see on the Streetview are no longer manned.

Essentially, I'm guessing, he's taken advantage of the fact that there's no barriers between British Rail and the underground on this route, paying an underground fare to evade buying a rail ticket.

true,IHadaFishOnce,RU,russia,"Matic and Salah the only people that deserve any credit this game IMO. I was watching this game closely and I found the root of our striker problem....6ft tall Ba is playing the wings, passing back to Azpilicueta and Matic while 5ft6 Eto'o is running in between defenders waiting for a lucky deflection to fall in his path. 

I just can't stand watching us play so...cautiously against a 10 man Swansea. They couldn't even contain Arsenal! I feel for Salah because he actually tried all game, but he ran out of options towards the end and could only play 1-2's with Matic at the edge of the box. 

Azpilicueta and Ivanovic worked hard, but we should not call on them to send in crosses when we have Willian, Schurrle, Oscar, Salah and Ramires treading the wings. 

Now look at Swansea. Bony tallied more shots on target than our entire team, and he pretty much put Cech to work. Yes, that's right. The striker of a 10 man team worked harder than our entire team put together. 

Why couldn't we grab Bony earlier? We practically own Vittesse!

Also bare in mind that you have to live somewhere, your house might increase in value 5% but everyone elses similar to yours is too. It's a zero-sum game. The only people that win are Banks by giving people ever bigger mortgages.

It's completely irrelevant. Giving Bentaleb minutes is good for us in the long term. That way, if one of Capoue or (god forbid) Sandro goes, we have squad depth. 

Somebody did a writeup of LvG's 4-3-3 and the defensive midfielder. It's not to be a pure destroyer/ball winner, but to be a quick, incisive short passer, sort of like a Busquets or a Pirlo. I know we all love the Beast, but do you think Sandro's up for it? 

&gt;Do you think they game would be the same if we had him in their?

Erm, we won that game. A brace from Ade, an assist from Soldado, and an own goal for them. He wasn't subbed on for Paulinho, it was Dembele. Everyone here loved him on his debut. 

Hating Bentaleb, who's been doing well enough to earn at minimum a bench spot, seems to be a cover for hating Tim. The kid is improving by every game, and he's a part of our future whether you like it or not. 

Just imagine what we could've had if Sherwood was manager a few years ago. Abdel Taarabt is one of the brightest you talents in Serie A, fucking shame that we sold him because Lennon needs som non-injured competition.

&gt;all who will likely go somewhere else in the summer

Really? *all* of them? Seven of these guys we signed this season! Why would they? 

&gt;We already have a young team so we don't need a fdb

Why the hell not? FdB loved using youth, just like LvG does. The likes of Suarez, Vertonghen, and Eriksen all got their big breaks because of him. 

&gt;We had the best defense in Europe for so long, now we are just in shambles

Well, let's see his major flops and compare it to Sherwood then, yeah?:

-6-0 against City

-5-0 against Liverpool

-3-0 against West Ham

Sherwood's same record against those clubs:

-1-5 against City

-0-4 Liverpool

-1-2 by West Ham

Our defense was a shambles during AVB's tenure. I don't know what you blame this on, but I blame our physios and changing CB partnerships weekly (Dawson-Kaboul, Dawson-Vert, Dawson-Chriches, Vert-Kaboul, Chriches-Kaboul, the only one that hasn't happened yet is our best one, Vert-Chririches), but also the same suicidal high line that AVB played. 

You could make a case that our defense is better than it was under AVB just by these results, not to mention a much improved offensive record. I sincerely believe that even with Ade around, we'd still be getting boring 1-0 victories with the Portuguese.  

You're not wrong, but you are looking at AVB through rose-colored glasses.

&gt; The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the set of rules that governs the European fishing industry. It was introduced by the European Union in the 1970s  to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing industry.  It has utterly failed. The CFP has failed our fish and our fishermen, and desperately needs fixing.

Or http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/policy/marine/fisheries/eufisheries.aspx
&gt; The current EU fisheries policy has failed on all fronts: 72% of assessed European fish stocks are overfished and fishing activity inflicts widespread collateral damage on marine ecosystems, including seabirds and other marine wildlife.

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/chris-davies-mep/eu-fisheries-policy-reform-is-vital_b_2630273.html
&gt; Few people have a good word to say about the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), least of all the European Commissioner responsible for administering it. ""A failure"" is one of the kinder terms she has used to describe it. The CFP is one of the few measures that British MPs can actually name when they express their dislike of the EU.

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/13/europe-common-fisheries-policy
&gt; It is estimated that 72% of all EU fish stocks are currently overexploited, with over 20% being fished beyond safe biological limits. While the fishing economy has shrunk as a result of quotas imposed on around 150 species in EU waters ‚Äì with cod, common sole and sand eels particularly threatened ‚Äì these quotas have also led to the practice of discarding, where fishermen throw fish back overboard due to insufficient quotas.

&gt; Discarded fish rarely survive long, leading to massive waste and depletion of stocks. Whereas 8% of catches are discarded every year worldwide, fisheries in Europe often discard as much as 70%. In 2009, Scottish vessels were forced by the CFP to discard around a quarter of their whitefish catch, valued at ¬£33m.

There's a reason the crowd at Anfield is called the 12th man. They're apart of this team.

Plus there's the inherent issues like latency. If you have a bit of cash and the ADSL isn't too bad in your area, even bonding a few ADSL lines together is going to be much nicer than satellite.

We also have great youth coming up (Rossiter and Wilson have potential to slowly make the next jump with cup games next season for experience).

Our core is good, we're more than just SAS. Getting rid of excess (Aspas, even though he didn't get many chances - he's not the player for us going forward, neither is borini imo). More depth, and a top fullback that slots right into the first team, and I'd say We're in a good position going forward with midweek CL games.

Except in LvG's 4-3-3 Holtby would be an attacking mid, and Bentaleb would be the DM. Bentaleb is getting tailored more and more for that role is the point you were trying to make by throwing out comparisons to Capoue and Sandro. If we're looking at the future, Bentaleb is going to very much have a spot in the DM role, while Holtby may even have to ride the bench, as LvG knows where Dembele fits into his system from their AZ days together. 

&gt;Also carrol looks like he's going to be class and has showed some skill in the first team. He should be playing over bentaleb

Carroll hasn't played in the first team for the good part of the last one and a half years. How do we compare Bentaleb's time at playing consistently at a higher level to Carroll's loans to Championship sides? For fuck's sake, Bentaleb's 19 and can play for the full 90. Give the kid some time. 

&gt;If it isn't LVG then it's a pochettino style manager.

That's a ridiculous assumption, to prefer Pochetinno to FdB. De Boer's embarrassed City and Barcelona in the CL. You're going to turn that down?

Antidepressants are simply a tool. For some people they become a necessity to function, righting a chemical imbalance in their brains which they need to exist with the rest of us.

For the majority, they *should* be a temporary measure until therapy is available. Depression puts your life on hold, and antidepressants don't necessarily help you move on from that point. They are not even effective in a significant proportion of people.

Access to appropriate mental health services in the UK is fragmented at best, or totally unavailable at worst.

For every person that has not received effective therapy, antidepressants are simply a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. One which will not heal without intervention.

This is not necessarily caused by a fractured society, the causes of depression are innumerable and extremely varied. Antidepressants hide more serious problems so I suppose that part of the analogy stands up but peeling back the paper doesn't necessarily reveal a broken society.

My personal view is that modern lifestyles are profoundly unhealthy and ignore human needs.

What I will say, and maybe people who live in Wembley or spend time in the Regent's Park area of central London (which is where a lot of fans seem to congregate before the game) will agree is that the crowd is made up of a surprisingly large amount of people from mainland Europe. We see them everywhere at work, especially Germany and Scandinavia. People will make the trip to England to watch the NFL.  They don't even always follow the teams who are playing, you see significant numbers of jerseys of pretty much every NFL team in the crowd. 

There is definitely a market to play another game somewhere on the continent if the teams are agreeable to it.

Because most people are assuming it won't happen, of if it does it won't happen for many years allowing plenty of time for good fortune to deliver them a higher paying job or enough capital gains to sell-up and move to some magic semi-rural commuting utopia that doesn't actually exist.

Although in a way they're half-right.  Interest rates going up would have such a catastrophic effect, that the need for interest rates to go up would be instantly invalidated.  You don't need base-rates to go from 0.5% to 4% to get back to normal, them reaching 2% will be enough to choke off any recovery.  This will leave everything in some limbo middle-ground where no-one's happy, but everyone can claim it's a good thing.

What will really be interesting is how international interest rates change.  If Bank of England rates max-out at 2%, but US rates go higher, then we could see a decline sterling and imported inflation.  This would also be very bad for the economy as it reduces consumer spending power, but lowering rates would make it worse.

France has the best healthcare in the world, as ranked by the WHO. [Source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000) The UK is in the 18th place. Granted, this is in 2000, so things may have changed, however it can be said that both countries provide good quality universal healthcare, and that France is better in general, as shown by the first place. However, in the UK, the big problems are waiting lists and cutbacks. Rare condition sufferers may not get the help that they need. The fact that homeopathy and [gay conversion therapy](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/06/gay-conversion-therapy-nhs-health-minister) are subsidised by the government and are avaliable on the NHS shows that the health system over here clearly has major issues. Things have to be improved and they can, it's true that excuses are being made. I've never heard the French go ""woo healthcare"", however the Brits do, I mean, it was in the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics and all. It's clear that someone is doing something better and every developed nation should learn.

true,GlassesAndMoustaches,logo,Merlin,"I reckon there's a 33.5% chance we'll win the league. Lemme explain:

Realistically we NEED Chelsea to beat Liverpool, I don't think the reds are going to drop points anywhere else.

We NEED to win every other game including Everton. Never underestimate lower table teams. We have a build up of matches - more so than any other team - so we'll be running on tired legs during some games. We've also just lost Toure to an injury and Vinny doesn't look 100% to me. Fortunately Demi looked good today

TLDR; I don't think it's as high as 35% chance but 30% seems too low. Read for explanation ",0,1397426736,null,0,false,0,cgrl0tb,t3_22xedy,t1_cgrl0tb,t3_22xedy,null,1433340383,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1
