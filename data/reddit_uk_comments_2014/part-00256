By writing ""spoiler-free"" in the title, the implication to most people would be ""this post contains NO spoilers"". This is not actually the case. I hear what you're saying about reviews containing plot elements, and I understand entirely.

I just thing your warning is ambiguous to the point of being downright wrong. You need to say very clearly ""This post contains spoilers"".

Depends if the Tories win the next election or not. Even then I'm not convinced it'll happen. 

&gt; that the power to set Scottish income tax and benefit levels haven't been signed up to by all parties?

We've been lied to before in exactly the same way. In '79 it was the former PM that was making the promises &amp; they were promptly withdrawn when his party took power. 

What's the point in controlling the income tax anyway *when it goes into the same big HMRC pool*? Do you think they'll let us drop the level and contribute *less* to the UK? There would (quite rightly) be outrage in England. So in essence they get the power to raise the tax level and pay even more into the next big London infrastructure project. Wonderful.

WRT benefits, who's pockets will a possible increase come from? If it comes from local taxation or Scotland's block grant then they can already do that e.g. as is the case with the bedroom tax.

These new ""powers"" do nothing for me, a super-light version of Devo Max with none of the real advantages of it. We want to be able to invest more into our crumbling infrastructure instead of helping a super-rich foreign bank build a skyscraper in London via tax breaks greased by party donations.

&gt; Which, of course, independent Scottish politicians would never do

Sure, they will have the usual bullshit, but I don't see how that affects the argument here. If our politicians follow the Westminster model and take bribes to provide incentives for foreign investors then at least the money will be spent in Scotland!

true,canyoufeelme,null,null,"So you watch a bunch of news stories about foreign conflicts , hate all Muslims because of the Islamic focus post-9/11, and then vote ""right wing"" (?) (could be more specific) in your *own* domestic policy because your main priority is addressing the ""Muslim problem"" and that would of course be achieved only by the ""right wing"" through through [blank] after being exposed to instances of abuse or violence at home and in developing countries in the media 

Can you please expand on this, it just makes no sense to me. It'd be like me hearing stories about Saville or Ian Watkins and abuse in parliament or the catholic chufch, or white boys shooting up schools and cinemas and nurseries as well as white boy serial killers and all of that and then voting for some anti-white party, or framing the whole thing as a disproportionate heterosexual male problem in a wider societal context to begin with and then vote for some anti-heterosexual, radical feminist party, or hearing about troubles in developing countries and subsequently allow that to influence my voting on foreign or domestic policy in a way that actually only adds to the troubles 

The main question for me is do you allow the coverage of other cases of abuse like Jimmy Saville, Josef Fritzl, Ian Watkins etc. influence your perception of men, or white men? Would they lead you to resent me, a white guy, because of what they did? What about killers like Jeffree Dahmer? Would you assume I'm more likely to be a serial killer because most are middle class white guys from western countries because of him or others - unless they are gay, or goths, because when someone of a minority group does something it is magnified and amplified in a way that makes you associate the images of certain groups with bad people leading you to become evasive towards anyone who represents that image, and because as a group they are rare they stand out more. So we focus on minority groups because it's easier; they're rare, they're mostly invisible, they're not me. 

You know people could frame this whole thing (in a wider societal context) as a disproportionately heterosexual male problem if they wanted. The sectarian violence, the rapes, all of that. Hate crimes, oppression, you name it. Not just the Pakistani based misogyny in this instance but the Catholics in Ireland and elsewhere and everyone from high society, entertainment and politics to your average chav or frat boy and then using your logic not only vote for some sort of Anti-Heterosexual, Totalitarian Feminist Party that promises it can get rid of  as a result of being exposed to heterosexual men doing horrible things in the media and associating their image with rape, violence or oppression, but also become dismissive and evasive towards men entirely, because despite being a minority of 49%, they make up the vast majority of violence, rape or abuse compared to their female counterparts. seems irrational and prejudiced and somewhat naive in the ignorance towards how my perception was being twisted by my only exposure to these groups being shocking stories as news often is and never actually interacting with or getting to know the groups in real life. 

Just because I am a man, there is no need to resent me because of Josef Fritzl or Ian Watkins. Just because I am gay, does not mean you should fear me because of Jeffree Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy, anymore than I should fear you as a gay basher or resent you as a sexist pig for being of the ""heterosexual"" label. I think if I were allow to myself to resent heterosexual men because of constant exposure to the atrocities they commit and then allowing that to drive a wedge in my perceptions, interactions and relations with heterosexual men in the real world it would only cause me a lot of stress and hate and paranoia that helps nobody, and allowing this to influence my vote in this way would be irrational. 

I think you've allowed the constant exposure of sectarian violence in developing counties and abuse by members of minority groups in the media to stir you up and get you angry like they were designed to do and I think it's important to consider why we let instances like this in the media influence our perceptions of certain groups over others, and why we don't assume every straight guy is a gay basher or a child rapist despite being exposed to an equal or greater stream of instances in the media I.e Ian Watkins, Joseph Fritzl or Jimmy Saville. We don't correlate their image or identity with rape or violence, unless they're a minority; it's never framed as a male or ""white culture""
problem, it's a Muslim problem. Or a catholic problem. Or a gay problem. Because they stand out more because they are minorities we don't usually interact with and our exposure to them is limited to shocking things people of this group do and not the 99% of people who don't make the news because they are law abiding and gentle and go to work everyday and come home and watch TV with their family 


When it's someone who isn't of a minority group, it's framed as a problem with mental health or upbringing and their skin colour or sexual orientation or the fact it's men most of the time anyway goes unnoticed. I understand why you became this way, because prejudice is hard to fight and the reporting on certain groups has been intense post 9/11 and that climate is encouraged, but my advice would be to base your opinion on people you meet in real life and not the media, or maybe the problem is your only exposure to Muslims is through the media entirely, and in our post 9/11 climate this is very rarely a positive one obviously. ""Law abiding Muslim goes to work,
does the dishes and watches TV with their mates"" is hardly news. 

If I was constantly exposed to stories in which heterosexual guys do horrible things in an alternative universe where they are a relatively invisible minority I never actually interact with very much at all over a decade (and this only gets worse the more I'm exposed to stories in the media without getting to know any personally) then it's easy to become prejudiced and paranoid. Doesn't mean it's rational though; just because 99% of the stories of rape or child abuse I'm exposed to are about men doesn't mean 99% of men are violent, rapists or child abusers, and it doesn't mean other groups don't do it as much or more, we just don't associate these things with certain groups like we do with others. in reality most men aren't any of those things; in reality 99% of men *aren't* rapists or violent or child abusers despite making up 99% of our exposure to these crimes in the media. Since they aren't an invisible minority we don't associate these crimes with their sex because we see with our interactions with most heterosexual men in real life that 99% of them aren't violent or rapists; if we were exposed to these stories without actually seeing for ourselves most men aren't like that because we never actually see or interact with them then it would be a whole
other story, which is why you become so evasive towards Muslims over time I think. I'm not sure how voting ""right wing"" will help
though. Not buying it to be honest; used to
vote green but then decided to ""turn right wing"" because of stories about Muslims in the news? Not very realistic to me in many ways ",0,1409531150,null,0,false,0,ck5ukbw,t3_2etl46,t1_ck5ukbw,t1_ck37vma,null,1427262778,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Position A: White people should stop taking from any elements of other cultures and adopting it as part of their own, as doing so corrupts and mocks that culture because white people don't and cannot ever understand it, unlike other people who have the appropriate ethic heritage and history.

Position B: White people should stop taking from any elements of other cultures and adopting as part of their own, because doing so corrupts their *own* superior heritage and history.

Far-left meet far-right. The (crazy) reasoning is basically inverted, but the net resulting argument is ethnic and cultural segregation between white and non-white people in both cases.

I mostly make soup, pasta bake and casserole dishes as they are cheap and last a long time. You can bulk up anything nice with rice, beans and pasta which are all dirt cheap and easy to prepare. Meat is expensive and you need to learn to create meals without it by focussing on hearty veg like mushrooms, aubergines and chickpeas.

There's people on here talking about devs learning ONE language and then it goes out of favour. To me that's just a lazy dev with no real skills.

Dev is a philosophy towards code. Once you learn actionscript, JS is about 4 days away, with a good book. All other OOP languages are about the same.

Any dev worth his salt should know 3 or 4 flavours of scripting languages and at least one actual language (like C) to start with.

Jan, Kaboul, Lloris, none of them are captain material, they don't have the required determination and influence on the squad.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,"If you try to implement some form of complex tax avoidance without specialist advice you'll do it wrong.  *(When I say complex I mean things other than the normal, straight-forward stuff like buying an ISA.)*  The avoidance won't work.  You'll more likely than not have to pay the tax and you'll probably get to pay a penalty as a bonus.

If you go to a third-party there are two paths.  A bespoke scheme will cost a lot more.  *(And there's still no guarantee it'll function.)*  Alternatively you use a marketed scheme.  

If you use a marketed scheme under new rules you'll have to pay the tax up front and **if** the scheme works you'll get it back after HMRC has done enquiring into it.  If it's a scheme that has to go through the Tax Tribunal *(and it will)* it could be several years before you get the tax back.

Bear in mind also that the person selling you an avoidance scheme isn't incentivised to tell you whether HMRC are already looking at it, or at precursor versions of the scheme.  They make their money when you buy the product.  The consequences of it failing are all yours.  *(There have been a few cases of people trying to claim from people who sold them unsuccessful avoidance schemes, but I don't recall ever seeing a successful case reported.)*

There is a possibility that if you use a scheme that doesn't work that you will end up paying a penalty.  This will be a percentage of the underpaid tax and is based on the behaviour that led to the underpayment.

This means that it's hard to charge a penalty in respect of a lot of avoidance schemes.  You can show that you took specialist advice and you saw counsel's opinion that the structure worked.  That amounts to reasonable care.  If on the other hand you start playing games like setting up a company and routing your income through that and you mess it up, you'll likely win yourself a hefty penalty.

There are a lot of people who consider themselves to pay too much tax and also too busy to look at what they *invest* in to dodge tax.  This is a bit like buying a house without having it inspected, even though you saw a huge dark patch of what looked like dry rot in one of the pictures.

You note that your life is too stressful to spend time finding and meeting with a tax advisor.  Over and above the mathematical consideration you'd want to factor in some way how you'd going to feel about getting a notice of enquiry from HMRC; having to find an advisor to deal with your enquiry; being asked to attend meetings to discuss the aspects under enquiry.  *(The last isn't highly likely if you use a marketed scheme.  It probably is if you start some sort of income routing through a limited company shenanigan; which is one of the things you mentioned.)*",0,1409537680,null,0,false,0,ck5x7qy,t3_2f2yoz,t1_ck5x7qy,t3_2f2yoz,null,1427261540,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Now I'll be honest, most of the jobs paying that were erm, I'm thinking to think of the professional word, presenting me with a set of challenges to over come...

But the point is, developers with any decent experiance cost multiple times median wage.  Add in, what I'd consider basic maths, say ability to integrate e^x, and that jumps again.

In London this is also heavily warped by the banking technology demand.  But also just go to a start up event, developers are in the minority to the *I've got this great idea, it's like Uber but for parrots* types.  In many startups devs are paid cash and equity, whilst others are paid very little.  Dev's are in higher demand than any of the other people.

Part of the problem is firms have to be willing and able to teach and train people.  Given that good, experienced developers are often the bell of the ball, it's difficult for firms to invest in such training, as they have no obligation that the person will stick around, they are effectively loosing money on not having a developer.  But worse, a bad developer requires a good team, great management structure to prevent them doing damage.  This is a structure many firms lack, as it requires not just good experienced devs, but is prohibitively expensive too.  Almost a catch-22.

I say this not to shit on Spurs for being talked up last August, but to point out that last year at this point the assessment of the two teams' talent levels was very different.

Hindsight is 20-20, of course, and Liverpool had an amazing run in the league. But they were very much helped by the fact that they had basically no other competitions to deal with; they didn't pull away from Spurs until they were out of both cups and their amazing run of form at the end of the season was built on a formulaic schedule week in week out. Monday, Tuesday- recover. Wednesday through Friday/Saturday- scout the opposition and train. Gameday- win game, 6-3. Repeat.

The starting 11 was full of good talent, it is true. Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge, and Suarez were brilliant, especially, of course, the last three. But beyond that Liverpool's options for attack were very thin. There was Lucas, Aspas, Joe Allen, Moses, and Alberto as cover.

The defense too was a mess, though a fair part of the reason for that lies in training and can't be pinned on a dearth of individual talent. Flanagan and Johnson were far from excellent, as was the lovable but erstwhile Aly Cissokho. The CB pairing varied from week to week, and was never truly solid after the first three games of the season.

Mignolet, of course, is behind Lloris.

I'll accept that Islam as a religion has a long way to go with regards to women's rights and that may have contributed to a line of thought that saw these women as 'less than human', and that pressure to keep abuse out of their own community (not to shit in one's own yard, for wont of a better phrase) may have protected Muslim girls from such abuse. However, there are many other factors that will have led these men to abuse. The fact remains that most sex offenders in the UK are white, male, and not Muslim. What reasons explain their behaviour given that they are not influence by islamic culture?

I object strongly to racists co-opting an awful series of events to push an agenda. Nobody goes on about white men having an abuse problem when talking about this on a national scale, even in the fallout from the Savile revelations. So why in an area with a concentration of Muslims, when this happens, is the blame put on them and their culture? It's clearly part of a much bigger picture where men from all backgrounds see these women as worthless, it's indicative of a deep-set misogyny within a certain subset of men who feel that it is ok to abuse their power over women because those women don't matter. Yes it's unfortunate that in this instance most perpetrators were Muslim and most victims were white, but these are not the only instances of child abuse in the UK and they fit a picture of men motivated by misogyny, not racism and not by their religion.",0,1409547274,null,0,false,0,ck60tvh,t3_2eschd,t1_ck60tvh,t1_ck60jm7,null,1427259814,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

&gt;

&gt;__Virtue ethics__ (or __aretaic ethics__  /ˌærəˈteɪɪk/ from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) *[arete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete)*) emphasizes the role of one's character and the [virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue) that one's character embodies for determining or evaluating ethical behavior. Virtue ethics is one of the three major approaches to [normative ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics), often contrasted to [deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology) which emphasizes duty to rules and [consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) which derives rightness or wrongness from the outcome of the act itself. 

&gt;The difference between these three approaches to morality tends to lie more in the way in which moral dilemmas are approached, rather than in the moral conclusions reached. For example, a consequentialist may argue that lying is wrong because of the negative consequences produced by lying—though a consequentialist may allow that certain foreseeable consequences might make lying acceptable. A deontologist might argue that lying is *always* wrong, regardless of any potential ""good"" that might come from lying. A virtue ethicist, however, would focus less on lying in any particular instance and instead consider what a decision to tell a lie or not tell a lie said about one's character and moral behavior. As such, the morality of lying would be determined on a case-by-case basis, which would be based on factors such as personal benefit, group benefit, and intentions (as to whether they are benevolent or malevolent).

true,kwyk,null,null,"Hmm, watching the hyper-athletic, enthusiastic forwards of Liverpool really showed what we're missing up top. 

Adebayor is a decent option, sure. But like everyone has said we know he has to offer and unless someone turns into the next Bale, we probably won't break top4 with him. 

Soldado... again, not bad once he finds form. But I feel we'd be better off with a striker who's making more explosive runs and stretching the defense and just generally keeping the defense on their toes. I think he lacks the ability to really turn the EPL CBs and I think it's essential. His build up play is excellent but I think a team aiming for top4 is going to need a striker popping them in regularly and not sure that's gonna happen, despite the optimism here.

Kane, I have high hopes for this lad. Actually seems pretty complete FOR this stage of his development. I do feel though, that he may best as a 2nd striker to an athletic, endeavoring striker. 

I'm gonna mention Chadli as I see him as more of a forward than a midfielder. I think he has heaps of ability but at the moment he is playing too conservatively... often not attempting things at speed and playing the really simple passes. This may be in part to the fact our off the ball movement is pretty poor and no one is looking to get in the box. Whenever Chadli gets the ball, Ade seems to want to come collect it instead of competing in the box (shutting Rose out of the play, the overlapping runs are a key reason for him being on the team), and when the ball is wide left Eriksen and Lamela both seem to occupy the same positions in the pocket. It seemed yesterday that [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=4bx1s) kept happening. I personally would prefer to see something more like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=4bx1b). (I'm assuming that Chadli has the ball in both situations). 

Regardless of whatever happens player-wise, I just feel it's all a bit too predictable against a decent side once their defense is set. For this reason I think we could really benefit from Welbeck, who'd hopefully make some more incisive runs for Eriksen to hit.

&gt;A 2011 study by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre looked at the 2,379 potential offenders caught grooming girls since 2008. Of 940 suspects whose race could be identified, 26% were Asian, 38% were white and 32% were recorded as unknown. Asians are roughly 7% of the population.

Yes most sex offenders in the UK are white, given that whites are 87% of the population. That has no bearing whatsoever on the clear fact that that the rapists in this case were almost entirely Pakistani Muslims.

What factors do you think caused them to rape given that you push the aspects of Islam and culture to the side?

It is clear from the statistical evidence that this is not an issue of men in general but specifically the community of Pakistani Muslims in Rotherham.

I would never ever attempt any sort of tax avoidance shenanigans (anything other than an ISA, a proper pension fund, etc). What you described about tax avoidance is exactly why I haven't even looked at it so far. I simply can't believe I'm paying enough tax that it will be worth the added effort / stress. If it'll save me 2k a year for five years, screw that, I'll work harder and make that money myself instead.

*However*, and that's the core of my question, I'm not a money making magician. If I can save 10k, or 50k a year, well, maybe I'm willing to see a tax specialist. I will still be left with the questions you described - I'm sure I'll find a bloke to sell me something, but is that something any good? As I said, I'm not overly worried about the price of the avoidance product/scheme, I'm worried about the time and effort and stress, especially when you compound that with the risk that HMRC will end up taking all I ""saved"" and even add a penalty on top.

But there has to be a salary range where not doing tax avoidance is stupid. I'm not sure if it's 100k or 250k or 500k or 1m or 5m, but at some salary, if a person isn't spending a lot of effort into finding the right tax avoidance scheme, they're an idiot (I think this has nothing to do with morals; if I ever made 5m, I'd give HMRC as little as I can, but also spend as much as I can from that point onward on benefiting mankind. I'm sure I can do better than the government, honest).

I did spend a lot of time and effort on the first property I bought (and it turned out to be a great investment). I do spend a lot of time and effort on understanding and planning my finances. I received professional help in that in the past, but I also know no one should take care of my money other than me.

You're probably never going to see it again but report it to the police and you might get lucky. If not you've got nae chance.

In future buy a good D-lock (and preferably in addition a cable lock to go through the front wheel -if quick release- to discourage opportunists). NO cable lock is suitable as the bikes main defence, no matter how strong it says it is on the label or how much armour it has plastered over it, a pair of £30 bolt cutters will go through it in literally seconds and a hacksaw doesn't take much longer. Most D-locks are pretty much bolt cutter proof but a cheap one will still give way to a few minutes of sawing so make sure it's good quality, the lock needs to be made of harder metal than the blade of a saw.

In addition make sure it's locked up even at night (otherwise what's the point) and make sure it's locked to something sturdy. If it's attached to something less durable than the D-lock then the thief's just going to cut through that instead. I've even seen people cutting through the frame of the bike when they couldn't get passed the lock (they'd still be able to sell the brakes, suspension etc).

If Rogers has such an arsenal at his disposal, with the two signing of Can and Lallana still waiting in the flanks, its hard to figure out why Allen is taking budgetary capacities.

There is some support for an enlargement of the permanent member list to include countries such as Japan, Germany and Brazil but this will either happen or not happen, totally independent of Scotland being in the UK or not.

3) Britain's status as a nuclear weapons state. The major UK political parties have all said they will retain nuclear weapons even if Scotland leaves so this won't be affected.

---

&gt;The expression originated from popular media commentary on young children being frightened by episodes of the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) science-fiction television series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, particularly during the 1970s. The idea that young children would hide behind furniture when especially frightening scenes were being shown, as they were unwilling to miss the programme altogether, was also popularized in the media.  The phrase is strongly associated with *Doctor Who* in the United Kingdom, so much so that in 1991 the [Museum of the Moving Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_the_Moving_Image_(London\)) in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) named their exhibition celebrating the programme ""Behind the Sofa"".

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","One issue here is that IT recruiters fall into two broad categories (from my experience employer-side):

 1. Simple automatable filters. You pay this sort a pittance, because really all they're doing for you is reducing the ~1,000 applications/day you'll receive if you advertise the post directly down to the 1 or 2 per week that could actually do the job, and if you were bigger, you'd automate their role out of existence.

 2. People who actually bother to try and find you a candidate who fits the role. These guys earn their 20% first year salary - they've read and understood your job description, they'll go back and forth with you to clarify what you really want, they'll give you guidance on what's realistic (e.g. ""you aren't going to get someone with 20 years experience writing Windows 8 device drivers"", or ""at £18,000/year, you're not going to get someone with 5 years experience, unless they're useless"", or ""You've said this is a Python role; Spring and Hibernate are Java things. Are you sure this set of requirements makes sense?"", or ""£60,000 is a lot for an entry level role. Do you really want a new graduate with no experience, or do you really want an experienced engineer?"").

Recruiters in slot 2 also think about things that aren't possible to put in a job description - such as ""firm wants a long term employee, but this guy never spends more than 18 months in a role, and usually contacts us to say he's interested in moving on after 12 months. Not a good fit"", and will, if necessary to get the hiring manager's attention, talk to candidates and say things like ""I know he's not likely to make you an offer - you're too expensive. However, would you mind if I put you forwards to the hiring manager with your salary requirements, because he's asking for someone as skilled as you, but is getting upset that for the money he's prepared to pay, I can't find him anyone?

""Hitler expressed his frustration and anger at the mixed response from the German media and insisted that, instead of openly calling for violence against the Jews as Goebbels had in instigating the pogrom, Nazi propaganda should ""elucidate events of foreign policy"" in such a way that the German people themselves would call for violence against the Jews""

The man has associated himself with dictators, accepted bribes from Saddam (oh he's very sneaky, hasn't left a trail of evidence, but the Iraq oil minister certainly confirmed it) and instigated a climate of anti-Semitism on the streets of his wards.

Either one of those would be a good signing, both are young, 23 and 22 years old. We all know that Lucas Leiva and Steven Gerrard will be out of the Liverpool squad in the next 2 season. Something that is really sad for sure. 

Both of those guys are immensely talent full and players Liverpool should consider when getting new midfield players. Our striker position/offensive midfield position is set for the next 3 seasons at least. With Ibe coming back next season. 

CB position we got Lovren and Sakho for the long term. Skrtel will stay while number 4 spot might go to Ilori i hope, or maybe Wisdom. Extremely talent full. 
If we can keep Manquillo we got RB set with him and Flanno for the next 6 seasons at least. While Enrique and Moreno should do good at LB. 

The only concern would be GK position and that it is not enough competition for Mignolet at this point. 

Do not think we are going to buy a lot of players in the future, only big stars that will improve the first 11. Got enough quality squad players. ",0,1409561669,null,0,false,0,ck64l8o,t3_2f3mbw,t1_ck64l8o,t1_ck5les2,null,1427257993,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

We were outplayed in midfield comprehensively, Capoue lost his runner on the first goal, Dier gave away a penalty stupidly (and questionably) for the second and the third was Townsend and Dier again.

We had NOTHING in midfield though, that was where we lost the game. All day Gerrard and Henderson were playing direct and accurate forward passes while Capoue aimed to retain possession with stale backward passing with which he sometimes succeeded. At least Bentaleb got his head up and passed forward from time to time, and Dembele drove forward with it. None of them pressed adequately.

Chadli's chance was a Kaboul assist, playing a pass that should have been played from a midfielder doing their job.

It's not remotely on Kaboul, and it's really starting to piss me off. You want to start Dier over Kaboul on the basis of *this game* where Dier is responsible partly or wholly for two goals?

'We' being the UK. This won't change just because of the politician's nationality.

&gt;In '79 it was the former PM that was making the promises

Which is why I was pointing out that *all* the main parties have signed up to the income tax/ benefits pledge. And that's before we deal with your example being thirty-five years old.

&gt;What's the point in controlling the income tax anyway when it goes into the same big HMRC pool?

You mean like keeping prescriptions free when they all come from the same NHS? Free tuition? I haven't noticed 'outrage' from UK about that.

&gt;WRT benefits, who's pockets will a possible increase come from? 

If it were that black-and-white, Cameron wouldn't be pledging it. Even if it were empty, so to speak, he's not quite that stupid.

&gt;These new ""powers"" do nothing for me...via tax breaks greased by party donations.

Reductionism can create anything you want.

&gt;Sure, they will have the usual bullshit, but I don't see how that affects the argument here.

Because it highlights how you're listing issues that ultimately won't change apart from leaving you with less of a safety net.

&gt;If our politicians follow the Westminster model and take bribes to provide incentives for foreign investors

Again, one example doesn't cover the all - and you're assuming investment from abroad won't be affected. And it's not as if Scots are doing badly in terms of money spent per head compared to, say, England.

&gt;That sounds exactly like the ""no"" campaign when you put it like that!

Not to me. And I don't really even have a dog in this fight, Scotland staying or leaving won't affect me much, despite having family on both sides - but at the same time I'd like to see them avoid digging a hole that it costs a lot, lot more to get themselves out of, and I haven't really heard any arguments that make it a no-brainer - if there was such, we wouldn't have people insisting that 16-year-olds can vote too, which is in itself a bit one-sided - if we're going to include people that wouldn't normally be allowed to vote, why can't Scots living abroad have a say?

&gt;What's your Plan B?

I'm not sure the UK needs one. That's not the case for Scotland, so the question becomes 'why is it worth the risk?'

Some have probably not understood what I was trying to do. I wasn't trying to make a new ready to use logo for the Blues. I wasn't even trying to necessarily make a Football Club Style Logo. I'm just trying to interpret the logo and it's traditional Elements in a style that i like. Of course I could do a logo that would be more up to the task of representing a football club, but why bother? I'm not a dreamer, I know that Chelsea or any other big club will not hire me to design them a new logo (Hey there Abramovic, if i'm wrong please contact me!). I obviously would have prefered if that wasn't posted here (dude thanks for the support but i knew that people who are fans of the club wouldn't like it). BUT THAT IS NOT WHY I AM HERE!

Some people are apparently way to fucking emotional about this. Someone is sending me fucking deaththreats via e-mail every 10 minutes from a different e-mail adress because of this ""Defacement"" of their holy logo. Of course, it's just trolling, i'm probably not gonna die today, because this person probably spends even more time than me in front of the screen. Also this person probably never had sex before. I can handle virgins. What I can't handle is that my behance account was hacked and my e-mail was used to sign up for some incest porn site where i'm not sure if the participants are of legal age. I don't know for sure but i'm 99,9999% positive that this is related to this as well because it happened within 2 hours after it was posted here and it wasn't posted anywhere else apart from r/soccer and my personal facebook at 5am. WHAT THE FUCK GUYS!??!???? Until now my behance wasn't changed but i can't login with my credentials. If it gets changed this could really harm me financially.

A points based system for the whole world wouldn't have that much impact on migration.  Moreover it would have a negative impact on those Brits who want to move abroad as the EU would implement a points based system for people coming from here.  No more students going to work in a bar in the south of Spain or Greece.  No more elderly retiring to Europe.

Think of it as a compare and contrast discussion between our season last year and what United might achieve:

&gt;So what's going on at Man United? Has the deal for Rojo actually gone through - does he have a work permit or not? What's happened with the Blind deal? Is that still waiting on something (a medical? paperwork?)? Now a loan for Falcao, but nothing in the defensive/holding midfield or CB/RB/RCB area? (Need back up for Rafael at least?)

&gt;The only thing I can think Van Gaal is attempting is Liverpool's game plan of last year and simply attempting to out score the opposition. But this won't work without a good midfield, which United might only just about have with their starting 11. There's not sufficient depth, and 1 injury and they'll be right back at square one, with a horribly unbalanced team, the defence and attack being isolated from each other again.
Will Vidal really solve that problem if they buy him? Don't they need 2 or 3 more players for depth? Liverpool only got away with it (lack of depth) last year because Coutinho and Henderson some how managed to not get injured in the last half of the season.

&gt;Edit: and what's this mean for Fellaini? He's not worked in the deep lying CM role at United. Could he play as one of the 2 CM in a 4-4-4 diamond?

My feeling is that it's a psychological barrier set at the £50K mark where wages are compressing against that barrier. 

This happened in Australia at the $100K barrier. I think employers see 6-figures as a ""high"" wage, even after 10 years of inflation. Also, employees probably have it in their minds that 6-figures is a too much to ask for, so they settle for something in the low 90s. Consider that the average wage in Australia is AUD$70K (£40K).

My pet theory is that this is happening here as well.

I've been working as an engineer since 1995, and times were great around the year 2000. But these days, I would no longer suggest people do engineering as a way to get ahead with a better wage. It's no longer a well paid job in general, just in certain areas. I don't think the cost of the education is worth the average wage.

I think there are two major problems with your argument.

1. For the vast, vast majority of people out there, ""kill all men"" is a joke, as evidenced by the fact a large amount of men (including, in fact, me) are men. **There is no philosophy that advocates the death of men**, if only because it would also exterminate the human race. Compare and contrast with racists and neonazis who see other races as inferior subhumans and would be entirely fine with killing them off.

2. Relating to this "" Is a person with a gun who wants to kill the next person with a certain characteristic any more evil than a person without a gun (but wishes they had one) who wants to kill the next person with a certain characteristic?"". **There is no reason, on the face of it, for which feminists would have more trouble obtaining guns than racists or anti-feminists**. As such, the fact that racists and anti-feminists get guns only shows that they, unlike feminists, are ready to actually kill people.

Mignolet (6). The usual handing errors and wayward distribution, but largely unemplyed apart from one stop.

Sakho (4). All over the place in the first half with some awful passing and reckless challenges, improved after the break, but still a poor display.

Lovren (6). He's not exactly calm and composed, and he looks like he has a mistake in him every game so far, but you have to applaud his tenacity and willingness to take responsibility. Needs to calm down.

Moreno (8). After his horrible debut, this was a masterful display. He was tireless and showed immense strength and speed. He may be a tiny in stature, big future. A fantastic Riise-esque goal was the icing on the cake.

Manquillo (6). will never be as eye-catching as his LB colleague, but solidity is a virtue. And he had another solid game.

Gerrard (6). A slow start - which is standard these days - but grew in influence and control, and his passing radar started functioning better. Another nerveless and brilliant penalty.

Allen (6). Invisible for periods of the game, but did his usual hard-working stint. Won the penalty too. I don't think he's a great player, but he's doing a decent job.

Henderson (7). Great play for the opening goal, and helped us to dominate in midfield with his hard work and indefatigibilty (sp?).

Balotelli (6). Missed some good chances, but worked hard and provided a threat.

Sturridge (7). Some very wayward shooting attempts, but his pace and close control were a constant menace to Spurs.

Sterling (8). Laughably poor shot after a  mesmerising run in the Spurs box. Good finish for the opener. He simply terrified Spurs. His more central position allowed him to be more invloved and he was integral to the victory. He has brilliant quick feet, and impressive strength, so technically he's always a threat, but when you combine that with his astonishing speed, change of pace and acceleration, you have a player that is unstoppable when on form.",0,1409566126,null,0,false,0,ck65eu2,t3_2f30zb,t1_ck65eu2,t3_2f30zb,null,1427257610,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I have been getting lots of advice from /r/FantasyPL and some of it paid off and some didn't: unfortunately I listened to all those who thought that Costa would only play for a few minutes, and now I have 12 delicious points gone to waste on the subs bench ... but on the bright side, I was going to make Ivanovich my captain and a few people persuaded me to change that, so at the last moment I changed my captain to Sigurdsson and gained a very nice 22 points out of that decision :)

This week I started to realise that there are a few advantages to being a total ignoramus about football: because I have no expectations based on last season's performances, I'm not one of the disappointed millions who are still hanging on to Rooney and making him captain in the hopes that he will start to score points. And because I have no loyalty to any team, I don't feel obliged to choose players from any particular team, like the poor bloke who has 3 Crystal Palace players in his squad. And, as my husband pointed out, there are some folks who passionately hate rival teams and would find it hard to include any of their players no matter how good they were.

So now it's time to summon my fan club, /u/satanspanties and /u/Girlwithnousername, to talk about the most important business of the colours for the midweek training kit: this week's colour scheme was suggested by Girlwithnousername - a stylish classic for the Autumn - [navy blue and grey stripes](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/1941828/event-history/3/) - I went for a french navy because it looks better against the dark background, and very smart it looks too :D",0,1409567666,null,0,false,0,ck65osx,t3_2f5jy1,t1_ck65osx,t3_2f5jy1,null,1427257480,4,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,4

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"1. Devastated. I feel, ignoring his dressing room presence and energy - we ruined him as a AMC. He comes in, plays CM in AVB's 4-3-3 (he isn't), and fails. Gotze would, anyone would if they were forced into that role. Poch comes, plays a similar 4-2-3-1 where Holtby thrived as the poster boy of Gelsenkirchen and is up there with our top 3 most technical/creative players. Gone. Eriksen is also great at AML, proven at Ajax there and would unstablize solid defenses with intelligent movement off the ball rather than ineffective games marked out easy at AMC like yesterday.

2. Sandro hasn't looked the same since his ACL, and he isn't a Poch DM. But I love him dearly

3. Probably signing J. Rodriguez (lol). LOL sums this up. We've seen (above point) what an ACL can do to a player - especially one like that. He was medicore before, looked like maybe a Championship/Low Prem style bouncing around those types of teams, then had a freak Kevin Phillips-esque 15 goal season. He's not ready till Dec (match fitness wise), pointless signing for now.

4. Signing Stambouli. I think he looks solid, remember - Scheniderlin played at a lower level and came from a worse French club. 6m is a bargain, and I think he's a good upgrade on a possibly overwhelmed/inexperienced/burnt out Bentaleb. I'm not too bothered by this.

5. Keeping Townsend. Please, please - don't get me started. Last time I mentioned this, I ended up with about -250 karma points. Get rid, asap. 8m and I would do it. Livermore/Caulker price would be great. 

Now, not being so negative we've got Vorm in - which is a great like for like Hugo lite and some occasions Brad wasn't the best backup - due to the system. Davies is a great, solid LB that has bought the best out in Rose and Rose even played his way into the England team. That's a plus. Lamela is fit, Capoue is regaining his Toulouse dominance and our new signings have had their year of transition. Fazio is much more of an upgrade one Kaboul and Dawson - his interception rate shows that. He also played DMC for 2 games, 2 clean sheets and 3 goals IIRC. His reading of the game makes up for his pace - and his leadership is essential from the back. I'm happy with that signing. Dier has looked a great prospect - and seems to have a really bright future despite a *lucky* start with his goals. He's looked solid and can only improve dramatically.

true,sosr,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire in London,"Listen OP, I'll try to be brief. You are not a squatter, you are a tenant. An AST, which is the kind of contract you have does not end automatically at the end of the fixed term. It only ends when it is ended by either side. The end date of a fixed term is really only there for the purposes of determining when the renewal date is. 

Even if they served a section 21 notice months ago, that is not the same as a court order allowing the landlord or his agent to gain possession of the property by force. In order to do that they need to go through different stages in court. No matter what the landlord or his agent might say, that cannot be done in a 24 hour period. 

For fuck's sake don't listen to the police. They don't give a shit as this is a civil matter, not a criminal one. If the agent forces his way in and assaults you, then do call the police, as that IS a criminal matter. And as I said before, do not start thinking about squatters' rights as that is entirely not applicable to your situation. At all. 

If you are ready to go in a few days or whatever then by all means do so. Pay up for whatever period you remain there, return the keys, clean it if you are contractually obliged to do so, and go through the process of getting your deposit back. 

If you are not ready to go in a few days then fine, this won't affect your ability to stay in the property until the correct procedure has been followed by your landlord.

Parties with near-zero credibility on delivering upon their pledges. 

&gt; And that's before we deal with your example being thirty-five years old.

I could have easily listed a long array of more recently broken promises. As the lib dem leader famously says, ""I'm sorry"". 

&gt; You mean like keeping prescriptions free when they all come from the same NHS? 

That's my whole damn point and you just did EXACTLY what I said would happen. 

The Scottish prescriptions come out of the Scottish budget. They have no bearing whatsoever on how NHS England spends it's money. If Scotland's welfare budget is increased using a similar mechanism then we can expect to see [the usual bullshit](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1362286/Free-prescriptions-Scotland-mind-austerity-rest-us.html) from the gutter press. They even have the audacity to outright lie and say ""despite paying far less tax per head.""

This idea of Scotland being ""scroungers"" didn't just happen, it's a decades-long campaign to keep support for independence down. You actually want me to trust these people on their claims that they've ""changed""? This sounds so much like an abusive marriage that it's no longer funny!

&gt; Because it highlights how you're listing issues that ultimately won't change apart from leaving you with less of a safety net.

We'll still be funding the latest London vanity project. I think HS2 is the next big one. How would you like to be funding *a program which drives jobs away from your region*? 

&gt; it's not as if Scots are doing badly in terms of money spent per head compared to, say, England.

It's still a huge shortfall from what we contribute. London gets a new high-tech rail network every few years. Glasgow doesn't even have a line crossing an empty field to go the last mile to hook it's airport up to the rail network. Seriously? We don't even have a full motorway covering the 30 miles between our two largest cities.

Upfront, Soldado, Adebayor and Kane should be fine considering we only play 1 up top. Otherwise we have the same situation as last year when Defoe was with us and rarely played. 

I'm content, it's about drilling the philosophy Pochettino has into these players and growing them rather than buying 8 players every season.

If you're going to be that cynical, I'm not sure why you think Scottish politicians will be any different. Our last PM didn't exactly leave a great track record.

&gt;I could have easily listed a long array of more recently broken promises.

And I could list a great number that weren't. Welcome to politics.

&gt;The Scottish prescriptions come out of the Scottish budget. They have no bearing whatsoever on how NHS England spends it's money.

Indeed (and I made a bad example) - but they will, if NHS Scotland has to truly go it alone. I don't follow how an organisation can function with the same options and safety-nets if it has a reduced budget - and neither do some in the NHS, hence the NHS Together bunch that highlights the Nuffield report demonstrating how Scots get more money per head because of contributions from England and other countries in the UK. Hence I was asking why there's no campaign/ pledge to raise NHS Scotland NI contributions (or why you think a debate on it would help).

&gt;then we can expect to see the usual bullshit[1] from the gutter press.

Which of course, represents the opinion of England - said nobody, ever. They sell fear, not truth.

&gt;They even have the audacity to outright lie and say ""despite paying far less tax per head.""

Newspapers? Lie? :-)

&gt;This idea of Scotland being ""scroungers"" didn't just happen

I wasn't aware of this idea, no more than I believe immigrants are on twenty times the benefits of a pensioner.

&gt;It's still a huge shortfall from what we contribute.

[Really?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10692466/Scots-each-receive-1300-more-spending-despite-oil-tax-drop.html) - those figures show a higher tax, but a much higher benefit - to the tune of £10 billion.

&gt; London gets a new high-tech rail network every few years.

No, we don't. I'm in the south-east, and we've just gotten our first new trains since they replaced the slam-door ones thirty years ago (and some of those were so old it was scary). You're ignoring the scale of things and the number of people/ travellers involved.

&gt;Glasgow doesn't even have a line crossing an empty field to go the last mile to hook it's airport up to the rail network. Seriously?

So...if this were pushed, how will the money be raised by a go-it-alone Scotland?

&gt;We don't even have a full motorway covering the 30 miles between our two largest cities.

The *entire country of Scotland* has less people in it than London. So making London/ Scotland comparisons is a bit disingenuous.

&gt;We've barely touched on the long list of reasons (e.g. foreign wars, state-supported child abuse)

Neither of those are common, ongoing or expected issues - I hope they're not the top of that list.

&gt;which I'm not going to go into with you because frankly I don't think you care all that much.

Your take on the issue is so stupidly one-sided (and so far, unconvincing), I don't think you're actually aware that this hasn't reached the point of what one could call a debate yet. Your eagerness for independence to the point of distorting/ ignoring/ converting all issues to fit your agenda was the reason I was highlighting that I don't have a particular preference either way - to demonstrate I'm not interested in legitimising a pre-existing agenda; which means that for the status quo to be 'wrong', you have to prove that a change won't cost more (like the rise in NI contributions it would take to keep NHS Scotland private, which you didn't address once it wasn't ammo for your cause).

As I am sure you are aware the above are all bastions of separatist sentiment, so you are right not to trust them.

The set-up costs of independence are neither here nor there when considering the prosperity of the country as a whole, because that money is not being sunk into a black hole. *It is being invested back into the country*, taking the form of new jobs and facilities. Exactly what those set-up costs would be is hard to say, but we should get a pretty good idea over the next two and a half years should Scotland vote yes in a little over two weeks. Regardless, it's hard to see how money remaining in Wales could possibly harm the Welsh economy. 

Concerns about EU membership are overblown in Scotland's case and would be in Wales' too. Yes, automatic accession won't happen. Yes, negotiation will be required for entry. Both Scotland and Wales are signed up to a raft of EU conventions on everything from water quality to human rights, as parts of the UK. Both Scotland and Wales are fully functioning democracies which respect the rule of law. Both Scotland and Wales have much to offer as trading partners in the single market. There are no ground upon which an attempt at accession could be blocked, and an inherently expansionist EU is not about to revoke the citizenship of millions of individuals living in either country. Sure, it would take time, and sure, there would be sticking points, but really, the eventual EU membership of Scotland is not in doubt and Wales' wouldn't be either if we were seriously pondering independence. As for the UK's famous negotiating power - I'll happily leave it behind, thanks. A small voice on the world stage pursuing the economic and political interests of Wales is preferable to a big boomy voice that doesn't give a shit.

Now, I know you don't like numbers, but it would perhaps be helpful to avail ourselves of the level of taxation in other countries before declaring that tax haven status is the only way forward for small countries.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; But it manifestly is a Pakistani Muslim problem. Yes, it's not unique to Pakistani Muslims and yes, it only involves a minority of Pakistani Muslims, but there do seem to be problems with this ethnic group.

so is it an ethnic problem or a racial problem or a religious problem, you just don't seem to have any clue do you? And everything in that quote contradicts the first sentence. The fact is you lot are never satisfied, if the 'muslim community' doesn't come out against it you accuse it of disinterest and at worst complicity, when muslim organisations do come out to condemn it you call it disingenuous or you ignore it completely (same goes for terrorist also). 

So most sex offenders and paedophiles are white, and 99% of Pakistani Muslim don't do this sort of thing, sounds like your trying to make this into something it isn't. The only mention of racism is those given by officials not to pursue the case (a very self-serving justification that avoids their guilt knowing the right-wing media will spring upon it), and just because officials perceive this case to have something to do with race doesn't mean it did. When we look at the evidence across the country we see that victims that come forward to report these crimes face opposition from police and officials who block their path with victim blaming and so forth, this reaction isn't anything new to Rotherham

&gt;Will you be amazed if subsequent abuse scandals involve predominantly the same ethnic/religious group?

no. Because anyone can commit paedophilia, it just so happens that the right-wing media pays a lot more attention when it's muslims so it furthers it's agenda and ideology. The more prominent and more extensive abuse of children by celebrities, all of whom are white, doesn't ring out statements saying this is a 'white problem' or a 'class problem', largely because the journalists, analysis and newspaper owners are themselves white and wouldn't permit such slander, whatever it's validity.",0,1409571050,null,0,false,0,ck66am6,t3_2f5ro2,t1_ck66am6,t1_ck662un,null,1427257198,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,RainbowLainey,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Help to buy is horrible, all it does is artificially inflate house prices for those not using it.  I'm in the market for a house at the moment (at round about the national avg. house price) so I've looked into the scheme in some detail, and it really doesn't seem that great. 

The government takes a % share in the value of your home, and when you sell it, they take that % share back out, so if your house increases in value, they get a proportion of the increase.  This means if you spend money to significantly improve your house e.g. adding an extension/outbuilding, you won't see all of it back when you sell.

However, it's not very easy to 'buy-out' their proportion.  You have to repay in lump sums of at least 5% of the houses' current market value.  With the average UK house price @ £265k, that's ~ £13k that needs to be saved up and paid off in one, you can't gradually pay it off over time.  And of course the longer it takes you to save that lump sum, the more likely that your house increases in value, increasing the amount you'd have to pay back if you want to completely own your house.

Also, 'help-to-buy' SHOULD be for first-time buyers, but it's valid for houses up to £400'000 (£600'000 in rUK).  The average house price is less than half that!   It should be £300'000 maximum.

Well, you could first let me respond instead of jumping down my throat.

I think it's a cultural/religious problem.  It has nothing to do with race.  I think that religion and Islam in particular can foster cultures in which outsiders/non-believers are treated with contempt.  I also think that the culture/religion has a tendency to treat women badly.

My expenses was extremley low (food, rent) compared to my earnings.

Yeah it is might be harder to live well with minimal wage in a nice house, and even have money for lot of other things. However it is almost impossible to do that in my country if you earn minimal wage.

There definitely shouldn't be a ""national"" living wage as the cost of living varies significantly throughout the UK. Paying a ""London"" living wage to people in certain parts of the North would put them well above the current average wage in those areas. However, if you vary it too much by region, it would increase migration to the more expensive areas (because people would see the ""raw"" number and not consider the reasons), which would increase the pressure on housing in those areas, increasing rents, etc.

The current ""minimum wage"" is very liveable in most of the North. Maybe by keeping things how they are and investing and encouraging growth in the North (and _not_ in London) we can develop a much more balanced and better distributed economy, such that we won't be in the situation where we continue to subsidise living in the one of the most expensive cities in Europe while the rest of the country rots.",0,1409572348,null,0,false,0,ck66jj6,t3_2f5muu,t1_ck66jj6,t1_ck655d9,null,1427257082,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Ultimately it would be great to have signed a world class LW or CB, but I think Levy hired Poch to work with the raw ingredients he's already got, rather than go out and buy a fully baked cake.  It's his first season, and the team will take a while to adjust.  Splashing $20 mil on another player or two probably isn't wise when the rest of the squad is still unsettled and getting used to the new manager.

I'm sure Levy is doing exactly what he did with AVB... spend little in the first season, see how it goes, and if Poch is still around next term, then have a bit of a splurge next summer.  It's highly unlikely we'll get Champions League football at the end of this season and I think Levy knows it.  Possibly wiser in the long term to hedge your bets for now, achieve par with a talented base squad (which probably means 6th position and quarters/semis of Europa), and then use that as a launching pad for a great season next time out.

- the local solicitors group is worth contacting for houses / other advice. They are not estate agents and are quite clued up for this sort of thing. The SPCs have a quasi cartel (in a good way!) for housing sales in Scotland. 
Try http://www.sspc.co.uk/

- There is a new railway going into edinburgh from the borders. Perthshire is still a short drive away but housing may be very very cheap for its proximity to rail in comparison to existing dunfermline routes. Completion is only Summer 2015 so worth pondering.
http://www.bordersrailway.co.uk/faqs.aspx

- Don't know much about dunfermline / bathgate but both are generally OK so I'm sure you'll find something nice.

- Some people rate penicuik for commuting and Edinburgh has excellent park and ride services. The tram is not bad either! S consider drivign to park and ride then commuting.....

Happy to talk about living in Edinburgh with family if you want but need questions. 

Lastly we have a different schooling system here. so worth boning up on as it will influence where you want to live. Like Balerno or even Berwick for the great free schools for the rugrats.

[My ideal team for us would be something along the lines of this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=4by5n)

Yacob screens the back 4, allowing our full-backs to push on. Varela is encouraged to cut inside, allow Pocognoli to overlap. Berahino and Blanco can switch, with the latter playing balls between the full-backs and centre-backs, to square across for Ideye, Varela and Gardner.

[But against Everton I'd play this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=4by6c)

Against Everton, Wisdoms tendency to hang back actually benefits us I think, as Lukaku has a tendency to drift out to the left against the full back. Should that happen, we can switch to a back 5, with Wisdom tucking in, and Gamboa and Pocognoli becoming wing-backs. Sess drops into Midfield and Varela works off of Ideye.

When we've got the ball Gamboa has total licence to get forward, while because of Varela being right footed, it allows Pocognoli to overlap.

Mulumbu provides the steel in front of the centre backs, with Gardner functioning as a box to box player.

As an American, I don't think so. While we do have much less restrictive laws requiring firearms than England does, there is controversy surrounding that. There are people in America who are in favor of stricter gun control here. At the same time, there's a sense that if you don't ""support our troops,"" an extremely vague phrase that can mean any of a number of things, you must hate America, and for quite a while there even politicians who explicitly said they wanted to tighten regulations on guns would, on the subject of foreign policy, have to throw the ""support our troops"" tag line out there, even when they wanted to end various military actions.

In other words, the Doctor hating guns would be less of a problem in America than the Doctor hating soldiers. The former would land him a few complaints but also some support. But if that soldier he met in space and hated had had an America accent, I think a few links would've been made in some people's minds that could've created an outrage.

I'm saying all this without expressing my own opinion on guns *or* soldiers, as I can agree or disagree with a fictional character on almost anything as long as I don't feel like the writer is shoving an opinion I dislike down my throat (or even one I agree with if they're patronizing or obnoxious about it).",0,1409576212,null,0,false,0,ck67edn,t3_2f113q,t1_ck67edn,t1_ck5dwkt,null,1427256682,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

This is absolutely mobbed with tourists during the Festival - here's [an example](http://files.list.co.uk/images/2012/07/02/royal-mile-4-lst074670.jpg). 99.999% of the people in his first image are bemused tourists, not people attending a political rally.

While he certainly enjoys a robust debate (and/or [ignoring questions from old ladies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zji4dTx-j8w)), the reason he's doing this is quite simply to attempt to provoke a reaction. That may have something to do with his rumoured plans to try and usurp Johann Lamont, or it may simply be that he's hoping to find someone willing to do something stupid. That it took him 74 days to find one is, IMO, quite encouraging.

&gt; {Ed002's Note - Falcao was offered to four English sides after it became clear his preferred move to Real Madrid would not be possible. 

&gt;In summary:

&gt; Last Wednesday in Monaco the club put a price on Falcao for a sale - with the expectation that Real Madrid (where he wishes to move to) would pay it. Real Madrid were concerned that at his age the asking price was far too high as were the wages. There were also discussions with Juventus and with Valencia. There have been approaches made to four English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City. The situation as I understand it this morning is that: 

&gt; - Chelsea saw him as way too expensive a package and went for Remy as their first choice (Destro) was not possible.

&gt; - Arsenal considered his age, his price, the possibility of a loan price and his wages and whilst they would like the player, seem to be trying to tie up the permanent transfer of another player instead. 

&gt; - Manchester City were not interested in buying him at the offered price but would have consider a loan to buy - but there have a major concern over his knee and they want a clause which will drastically reduce his wages and the loan fee should it turn out to be a problem.

&gt; - Manchester United were interested but again the price and wages are an issue. On Wednesday Manchester United used a third party in discussions and I understand that third party was again involved last night in trying to broker a deal that might be acceptable. I suggested earlier that if the club want a deal done today then they will likely need to concede most of the financial negotiations - and that is what they have likely done. Subject to a medical I would expect this to go through. 

&gt; The real killer here is the wages and the ad ons and the payment to certain agents, leeches, representatives and super agents - and a commitment to buy in the future (there will be a get out clause). I cannot see that Arsenal, Chelsea, Juventus or Liverpool would get involved with him at that level financially.}",0,1409576394,null,0,false,0,ck67g02,t3_2f5or9,t1_ck67g02,t3_2f5or9,null,1427256662,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

The thing is... they don't exactly have a perfect team at the moment.  They have many of the same weaknesses as we do (so-so distribution from the back, slow-ish CBs, high up the pitch fullbacks), but the difference is the cohesion and intensity of their front five players.  Sterling played like a demon on Sunday... he was winning balls against much physically bigger and stronger players due to his pure determination.  We didn't have anyone really playing like that, and if they ever did, it was a lone charge unsupported by teammates around them.

We fundamentally have had two problems over the last two seasons... to play out from the back adequately, and to break down defences sitting deep.  It's now incredibly easy for all teams visiting WHL to have the exact same game plan against us - drop deep to the edge of the box when defending, and press high up the pitch whenever our CBs or CDMs have the ball.

We really didn't help ourselves with our selection of Rose and Kaboul.  I know we lack true first XI depth at the back, but Kaboul made mistake after mistake, poor clearance after poor clearance, which kept us under pressure a lot.

And this article points out Rose's inability to hold a decent defensive position, but I think the more alarming aspect of his game is how little he adds to our attack.  Some FBs play like bona-fide wingers, and it's acceptable if they add to our attacks.  I really think Rose doesn't very well.  His idea of dribbling is more like kick-n-run, and he got dispossessed or lost the ball far too many times in attacking transitions, which is bad enough, but compounded by the fact he was then hopelessly out of position.

I really want to see someone else come in for Kaboul now (Fazio or possibly Dier if Walker is nearly fit again), and I want Davies to play at LB.  Although he has some weaknesses to his game too, I think he holds his position better, and will prevent us from finding ourselves under threat down the left as much as we do.",0,1409576463,null,0,false,0,ck67gly,t3_2f4y1d,t1_ck67gly,t3_2f4y1d,null,1427256653,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; you should make a legal distinction between them and ""proper"" jobs, and tailor the benefits system accordingly.

Isn't this the point of tax credits to an extent? If so, this is perhaps the infrastructure to administer such support.  

&gt; And even if only 1/3 of the people aren't getting enough hours to make ends meet, isn't even that too much? 

As a quick point, 1/3rd of people wanting more hours doesn't necessarily imply that they aren't making ends meet, only that they want to work more *for some unspecified reason.* Also, it has to be said also that over 3/4 of people on these contracts are working a regular number of hours, or their regular number of hours plus overtime.

I agree with the sentiment however. That said, I don't think banning them is the solution- even if people wanted more hours, if you ban their current form of employment the counterfactual situation isn't necessarily that they will be given regular employment, it could be that they are made unemployed altogether. Anti-abuse clauses would be nice (in particular, removing the possibility of exclusivity), but tough to implement in such a manner that the situation may be made worse rather than better.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; so is it an ethnic problem or a racial problem or a religious problem, you just don't seem to have any clue do you? 

It is my opinion that one of the reasons for the several cases of abuse from within Pakistani communities around the country, including Rotherham, is because of Pakistani culture being imported from Pakistan by immigrants, and then being incubated inside of isolated Pakistani communities in the UK which do not integrate, and so pass these cultural ideas along the generations. These cultural ideas are not compatible with British culture, things like treatment of women, and their place in society, and also what is an appropriate age for a girl to be in a relationship with a man.

&gt;The fact is you lot are never satisfied, if the 'muslim community'

There is no such thing as the ""Muslim community"". And the fact that these people have specifically said that they don't believe it was a cultural or religious issue shows that they hold a very different opinion as to why this happened from the majority of people in this country. 

&gt;The only mention of racism is those given by officials not to pursue the case (a very self-serving justification that avoids their guilt knowing the right-wing media will spring upon it), and just because officials perceive this case to have something to do with race doesn't mean it did. When we look at the evidence across the country we see that victims that come forward to report these crimes face opposition from police and officials who block their path with victim blaming and so forth, this reaction isn't anything new to Rotherham

How about you consider the possibility that it was a problem with **BOTH** the police and the local community. Very rarely are problems of this scale down to one single factor. 

&gt;The more prominent and more extensive abuse of children by celebrities, all of whom are white, doesn't ring out statements saying this is a 'white problem' or a 'class problem', largely because the journalists, analysis and newspaper owners are themselves white and wouldn't permit such slander, whatever it's validity.

In almost all cases like this it is the environment that the perpetrator is brought up in, or surrounded by that leads to their actions, either by encouraging it, or doing nothing to discourage it. The culture within television in the 70s said that stars could get away with doing whatever they wanted.

The reason nobody talks about white culture when a celebrity rapes a child is because ""white culture"" has nothing to do with it. ""celebrity culture"" is the cause, int he same way that ""Pakistani culture"" was the cause in this case.

 Talking about ""white culture"" is like talking about ""brown culture"" it doesn't exist. ",0,1409577557,null,0,1409577805,0,ck67qob,t3_2f5ro2,t1_ck67qob,t1_ck66am6,null,1427256523,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"1. Losing Holtby is in my opinion a big mistake, unless we bring in another creative AM for cover and competition. I hear that both Chadli and Lamela can play in that role if need be, but what I hate about that is that they should be on the field starting anyways. I don't really call that depth when the two ""backups"" are already starters. Holtby is underrated around here and I agree with /u/RifleEyez that we have ruined him a bit. It is incredibly telling to me that people around here don't know much about him when they're calling for him to play as a CM which he is not. He is a #10 and should be played as such. For those that say he has underperformed here is a bit of a stretch. He's hardly ever gotten a run of games for us and has almost never been played as a #10. It doesn't look like it's going to matter however because he's out the door and on his way to HSV.

2. I don't want to see Sandro go, but I can understand why he would be sold. He's a destroyer and a very good one at that. Has he lost a bit since his injuries? Sure, but that's to be expected from such cruel injuries.

3. Singing JRod is pretty meh. One good season and coming back from a big injury is hardly one to inspire an increased blow flow to the loins. 

4. Stambouli is a very good, smart singing IMO. Because of #2, he is an important pickup for depth and competition. He is a like for like player for Bentaleb/Capoue in that he can read the game well, is good in a tackle and is composed on the ball. He leads Ligue 1 in tackles and interceptions which is big. To that, his presence should push Capoue to perform and Bentaleb especially to perform and continue developing into the player we believe he can be. I know people around here were very excited for Schneiderlin, but for 20mil less this player is a bargain. I like Schneiderlin, but not for anywhere near the 27mil-30mil being touted for him. Sorry, he just isn't that good. This guy for 6mil will look like an absolute steal in 5-6 months IMO. 

5. Keeping Townsend is obviously fine with me. He can be an incredibly frustrating player, but possesses immense talent. He unfortunately just has a peanut for a brain it seems and makes poor decision after poor decision. Decision making can be coached/drilled into you and so that's why I haven't completely lost hope. If he can improve that, he can improve his consistency which is also lacking.

6. The Davies and Vorm deal was a good one. It brought in a much needed LB for competition with Rose who has looked good since the signing. Vorm is an obvious and definite upgrade on Brad. Overall he is a very good deal considering that we dropped a fringe player and a small amount of cash for two much needed players. 

7. Fazio seems like a good signing for us. We needed a new CB and he fits the bill. I don't know nearly as much about him as I quite frankly don't follow La Liga much if at all.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"First, ""white culture"" is no more a thing than ""brown culture"".

Second, In almost all cases like this it is the environment that the perpetrator is brought up in, or surrounded by that leads to their actions, either by encouraging it, or doing nothing to discourage it. Whether it be the culture of being a priest within the catholic church or the culture within television in the 70s that said that stars could get away with doing whatever they wanted.

In the cases you are talking about, where a white person has massacred a school or cinema, the fact that they were white had nothing to do with the reason they committed the crime. As I said before, that's like saying these men raped children because they were brown, it just doesn't make any sense. 

There was almost certainly another environmental factor which caused them to kill those people.

In the case of the Rotherham abuse, the environmental factor was the cultural beliefs of the Pakistani community that they were brought up in. It was **not** because they were brown. it **was** because they were Pakistani.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"(My last comment was respectful and serious and it got insta-downvoted.  So let's see what happens with this one.)

The short answer is that's a matter for investigation.  

My opinion:  Islam, like other religions, is based on religious texts which portray non-believers as the enemy.  [Virtually every surah in the Quran has fantasies about how non-believers are going to be tortured in hell-fire.](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/topics/hell.html)

Does every Muslim treat outsiders with contempt?  Of course not!  But, religion, and Islam in particular can foster cultures in which these problems arise.  It's quite easy for people to find verses in the Quran which justify bigotry.

[The Quran also has many verses which advocate treating women as second class citizens and some which even provide support for sexual slavery.](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/women/long.html)

-------

BTW - usually at this point I get accused of linking to an 'anti-Islam site'.  So let's talk about that.  

The site I link to is run by skeptics for skeptics.  The authors have produced similar compilations of offending verses from the Bible. 

Do they have an agenda?  Sure.  They're interested in criticizing religion.  But, even if you don't approve of that agenda, every quote they provide is sourced back to the Quran.

OK. I usually also get told that I'm 'cherry picking'.  That I should read the Quran.  Well, I have, in its English translations and I believe that the site I linked to provides a fair summary of the objectionable verses.

-----------------
So, what do I suggest we do?  

Well, some people reading my comments think that since I find fault with Islam that I'm advocating genocide!  

But that's ridiculous.  Religion is a set of beliefs and beliefs can be changed.  You don't have to kill people with wrong beliefs.  You can change their minds instead.

I don't want to deport or kill anyone.  I don't want forced conversions to atheism or Christianity.  I don't want Muslims' freedom of religion curtailed in any way.

Funding Circle is a lot of fun for me personally, and really useful for learning about the ways certain businesses work at a high, abstract level, but you can only deposit more than £100, and it has some other issues that might be a problem.

Funding Circle offers higher rates than Zopa, generally, but you have to be active in managing your loans. Let's say you just spend a half hour 'researching' the next company that you're putting your £20 into. You're looking at £1.25 to £2.00 return for that half hour. That's awful, even without the risk of loss. You also shouldn't be investing more than £20 per company, because you want to diversify your loans as much as possible.

I *really really love* Funding Circle, but if your time is valuable, i.e. you could be earning in a different way in your free time, and you're not interested in learning about how a business' finances work, I would recommend Zopa first every time.

true,fozzy143,CupFinalsCrest,,"Falcao would bring a lot to the squad though. I'm a strong believer that to win two seasons on the bounce you almost always need to bring in one high calibre attacking player. In fact in general it tends to be a good sign.  

Think about the last 4 seasons:  

This season: Chelsea look strongest with new signing Costa (+ Fabregas)  

Last season: City won with a reinvigorated attacking force (Negredo + Navas in particular)

2 seasons ago: United won after signing Van Persie.

3 seasons ago: City won after signing Aguero + first full season with Dzeko.    

Our attack has felt stagnant in these first few games. Dzeko, Negredo, Jovetic and Aguero are all quality and the resurgence of Jovetic could be enough to keep us interesting but on the whole we've only strengthened at the back. Personally I think we're going to have a lot more games like the 0-1 against Stoke this year where we're unable to create anything new and that's why we're going to loose the title.

I was meant to start tomorrow, the Agency said last Friday. On Thursday they said it would start on Monday. So that's half a week of being fucked around with. If I get a call saying ""It's on Thursday"" I'm going to tell them to shove that job up their arse (or someone elses - the company's would be good) and give me a different one.

The only good thing about not working yet this week is I can get my job applications out for other stuff that isn't ""being dicked around"".

The last job I had, I was stuck in a place with machinery that didn't quite work (every second product needed removing from the line as it was filled wrong, or *every* bottle of product needed weighing and hand wiping clean, etc), with a supervisor who never said anything to me that wasn't impolite (in tone if not explicitly) and was minimum wage. Another job I got home one day after - admittedly, a shit day, I'd apologised to the boss (2 hours of sleep the night before meant I nodded off inserting hose tails into hoses) - work and had a phone call saying ""don't go in tomorrow"", nothing else. I had a job interview at *expunged* Aviation services, for something I'm qualified for, and didn't get the job because they ""thought you only wanted to work 4 days a week"", and that's patently bullshit (I'd been doing 60 hour weeks at a previous job, no worries). So... it's just fucking annoying. I can't earn enough to move out and get my own life either, I can't earn enough to be reliable to be a fucking flatmate even. Employment agencies fucking me around, nothing else out there at all. I'll be the first to admit I interview badly but HOW THE FUCK am I meant to look enthusiastic about 12 hour days cleaning concrete drainage kerbstone moulds with no chance of advancement?

true,bungeeman,null,null,"I feel like I ought to justify some of the things I’ve said in this article as in my attempt to inform an audience who probably aren’t familiar with Pro Dota 2, I feel I may have left out some justifications that those of you in the know will probably find pretty confusing.

First of all, I know that the teams invited to the International are there based on their merit throughout the season, but that’s just the point. They are not there through some mathematically fair means such as a dedicated qualifying tournament; there is still some fallible human/humans at Valve deciding who gets in and who doesn’t. Coming from a sports background, I find that system to be antiquated and unfair. But that’s just my opinion and it isn’t a popular opinion in this particular scene.

The quote ""in other words, the team’s sponsors opened their wallets and purchased participation in the finals” is another example of my attempting to explain the system to people who may not have even played a PC game before. Of course I know that the teams didn’t literally leave a bag of dollar bills on Gabe Newell’s patio, but you can’t honestly deny that if Na’Vi and the rest of the Dota 2 superstar crew didn’t make an appearance at the International then it would have made considerably less money.

All in all, the point I was trying to make is that I feel e-sports is becoming a mathematically unfair, invitational and exclusive sport, governed by popularity and money and not by open and honest competition.


I may well be wrong, in fact I hope I’m wrong. Please convince me that the things I’ve just said are incorrect. I would be very grateful if you could. But after a lifetime of watching England play in World Cup qualifiers and watching my local football team sometimes qualify for the FA Cup.

The greatest danger they present is if they manage to break out into the Kurdish region, where they'd start a genocide, or if the Syrian government (the one we all hate so much that we armed their rebels - including the guy who became leader of ISIS) collapses and leaves another power vacuum for them to walk into.

That said, United's transfer activity in the last year or so has all the hallmarks and strategic direction of a mad, desperate drunk spending lottery money.

Falcao is just the latest ""whuh?"" signing.

They've got more than half a team who are left-footed, about 5 players who like dropping off the striker and ""playing in the hole"", and a formation which seems to be designed around players they don't actually have.

And they still, STILL, haven't signed a big, hard fucker who can shore up the midfield and help anchor the team.

Mourinho saw exactly what his team needed, and so bought Matic and Costa. United just seem to buy players very randomly, and that lackof focus and the aforementioned desperation is ensuring they also pay huge fees.

It's not like United have anything like the quality they'd need in their defensive midfield or back line to play with three strikers up front.

The main problem I'm seeing at the moment is the scaling back of industrial sponsors.
As a result Universities are the only ones driving science recruitment and when a lab creates a useful product, it gets spun out into a business which then moves away from the UK as it's too expensive to do anything with here.

Without going into too much detail, it ignores the constant searches, internment being imposed almost exclusively on one side of the population, plastic bullets being used with little regard for SOP against nationalists, the shoot to kill policies, the use of live rounds to control demonstrations, the transfer of arms from the BA to loyalist paramilitaries, the removal of patrols in areas where loyalists were operating, handing information to loyalists, operating murder squads, the Falls Curfew, and a whole host of smaller indiscretions.

Thats without going into their actual purpose in NI, to prop up a gerrymandered, sectarian state, which they did with ruthless efficiency.

&gt;Worked in a taxi call centre a few years back. Our drivers had PDAs that allowed us to track their locations. One driver left her car unlocked and the PDA in the car. Couple of folks stole the PDA and somehow activated the ""radio"" function, which basically made the PDA call the office. We listened in as the two theives walked home and could see exactly where they were. We called the police, couple of uniformed officers came round and looked at our tracker said ""we know exactly who that'll be"" and off they went.

The Spanish under-21 international and former Real Madrid prodigy has been held back by injury issues throughout his career, and for that reason, might come at a seriously discounted price for Villa.

The Villains have been chasing a playmaking midfielder for the last few days, and might be looking at Canales as an alternative to other previously linked targets. They were rumored to be close to making an £8m move for Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley, but that has yet to come to fruition. Cleverley is reportedly debating running out his contract in an attempt to get a bigger payday next summer.

Canales isn't exactly like Cleverley, but might serve the same function for Villa. He usually plays higher up the pitch and is a bit more creative than the United man, but obviously has an inferior fitness record and might not be quite as good at simply keeping possession.",0,1409581600,null,0,false,0,ck68xz5,t3_2f64pl,t1_ck68xz5,t1_ck68t5x,null,1427255962,7,false,avfc,t5_2s569,7

true,Fineus,null,null,"I’d advise finding SOME way out of Preston. I know it’s not easy from what you’ve said and I do sympathise but it’s a no brainer that there are more jobs in bigger towns / cities.

The North itself is not dead – but it does depend on what jobs you’re going for and what skills you possess. 

As for useless recruiters – it sounds like you got a bad egg who couldn’t admit her mistake but on behalf of recruiters I do apologise. Sometimes there is human error when someone is going away on leave and forgets to set up an answering message etc. BUT if you know the name of the agency then find their main line number and call that, then ask to speak to someone else to find out if the role is open or not. It may not be easy and you might have to do some hunting but someone should be able to help to a basic level. 

(I’m surprised she didn’t have someone covering her desk in her absence, at my company we do this as a matter of course for anyone who is out of the office for any reason). 

None of that matters to you though – when you just want some answers. Persistence really helps to increase your chances but sometimes you’ll be smacking your head against the wall and that’s the down side of job hunting. 

Keep your head up though, there is work out there but be inventive in finding it.

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"&gt; Capoue and Bentaleb are not responsible for any of the goals.

henderson's run for the assist. look at it. nothing special. capoue ignores it.

joe allen turns capoue very easily for the second then gets tugged down. (and bentaleb doesn't get close to intercepting the pass).

dembele doesn't cover the gap left because townsend is an idiot and gives a free shot on goal.

ALL three goals the DM's were near by and didn't deal with the threat adequately.

&gt; Liverpool terrorized our wings because that is the weakness in the system.

They didn't played with wingers, they played 4-4-2 diamond with their full backs providing width. Granted the strikers would often drop to the sides occasionally but that wasn't the main area of issue, we were getting done over quite a bit in the middle with sterling running rings round capoue/bentaleb.

&gt; were outnumbered in the midfield their job is to slow up play enough for others to get in in support of them

true,tomi9er,aggron,Ogre Magi,"That's fair enough that you tried to inform an unfamiliar audience concerning something you feel passionate about and that's respectable, but quite honestly some of your points, even with your justifications, are still lacking in plausibility.

 Yes, there is no direct qualifying tournament that gives you a guaranteed spot in your region's TI Qualifiers. However, the basis on which they invite these teams for a chance to qualify is done on nearly a full year of tournaments. There are no complete unknowns when it comes to the TI Qualifiers, teams are selected based on their performance throughout the year and are either directly invited to the event or offered the chance to participate in their qualifiers.

If teams are simply not up to par with current competition then there is no point bringing them in to the event, it's time, money, man-power and a lot of work on Valve's part to bring such an amazing event every year and adding in an Amateur section to TI would be damn near laughable. The skill-gap between teams at TI4 was so miniscule and despite the meta there were some absolutely amazing games and the individual skill shown by even the lowest tier teams (see, Arrow; ddz) was so far above what is seen in the amateur scene that, I repeat, it would be laughable to include such a thing.

On to your point about the big names, yes, The International would be very different if we didn't see Na'vi, DK, iG, Alliance etc. However, Alliance didn't even make it past group stages this year, Na'vi had a mediocre showing compared to their past performances. The names draw people in and give the community someone to root for, I mean who wasn't rooting for Na'vi during game 5 of TI3 finals, that was absolutely insane and it was probably the most crowd-pleasing tournament final I have ever seen personally.

Big teams will always be a part of any sport, digital or otherwise, that's a fact. But smaller teams always have a chance if they're good enough, Tongfu came in as a brand new team last year and did amazingly, this year they came back as NewBee with Xiao8 and took it after nearly being knocked out in group stages. Look at Liquid, they didn't make it to the main event, but they played to their absolute best and I will hillfight Gronors if they didn't give us some good games.

The whole thing about e-sports, and this is my personal opinion, is that you have to be good, you have to get noticed, that doesn't come out of just playing the game. Go out, meet people from the community, have fun with them, get piss-arse drunk and go to the casino and then play some Ability Draft with them and get shat on. All the tools are there for aspiring teams to get to the top, it just takes proper utilisation and the drive to succeed.

 &gt; competing again England on an economic scale.

without any idea of what that means in practice. If you do 2 mins of research with google and some maths, you'd find the following;

They would in no way 'compete' with England. They wouldnt even come close - at most they'd have GDPs of around 15% of Englands (~300 billion gbp vs 2.1 trillion gbp  - figures from googling for 'gdp for country'). The actual figures are likely to be much lower, given that at least 2 of the countries would be separated from a country they are currently in and would have to set up their own infrastructures from scratch. I didnt bother to include Brittany, because its negligible.


aside from that i find arguments like 

&gt; own language, it's &lt;type of&gt;  culture, blood and roots

can apply to basically any county that makes up the uk - Yorkshire, Lancashire, Somerset, Kent, Essex, it applies everywhere. Being different to somewhere doesn't automatically mean you should be separate from them.

Modern Welsh does employ a large number of English loan words, particularly for scientific and technical concepts but also for more common everyday things which are only quite recent developments - like the infamous *ambiwlans* and *tacsi*. That isn't exactly unexpected, given the pervasiveness of English. 

But then again, Welsh is hardly unique in that respect. English itself is absolutely [chock full of loanwords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_French_origin#Daily_use) from a whole bunch of languages, many of which have barely been altered, including a few from Welsh itself!

EDIT: Just to hammer the point home: Welsh *tacsi* is a borrowing of English *taxi*. *Taxi* comes from *taximeter*, which is itself a French loanword - the original form is *taximètre*. So *tacsi* is actually a borrowing of a borrowing. ",0,1409583427,null,0,1409585897,0,ck69lvj,t3_2f64r1,t1_ck69lvj,t1_ck68xbr,null,1427255652,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,DrMowinckel,flair7,,"I don't get what you're saying. You in large degree cherry pick players to fit your point and compare apples to oranges. You mention 4 primary offensive players as example of the pacy and powerful Harry and AVB squad, and then go on and mention a lot players all over the pitch in your example of our current squad. Harry had Modric and van der Vaart, power and pace isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of them.

Having different types of players is something I would call balance, and is IMO a good thing. You mention Kranjcar, Nelsen (the only CB you mention, why?) and Saha as players that where left out because they didn't fit the mould, no they where left out because they where poor players. They where also all Harry purchase, why did he buy them if he had this mould?

You still have a point, from Harry's days we still have lost some pace, when we played Bale and Lennon on the wings and had Ade or Defoe up top (ignoring those days we played Modric or van der Vaart on the wing for some fucked up reasons). And yes we were a pretty good counter attacking side in those days. So back too what I think your question is, what are we know?

You begin your OP with dismissing ""Poch's system"", this new buzzword (which really isn't new, everyone talked about ""AVB's system""), dismiss it at something without importance and then go on to essentially ask, what is our primary tactic. I get that people are tired of hearing about ""Poch's system"", no one really know what that is except mr. Pochetino himself. But there are some pretty clear evidence of what this is. He coached Southampton a whole year, and they had a pretty distinctive style. And after three matches you already see a quite clear style from Tottenham. It's high defensive line with high pressing, it's in-ward wingers, it's possession oriented as long as there are no clear counter attacking opportunity and it's two cdm whom primarily are good at defending and passing.

And fans had been calling for him to be dropped all season. It only becomes unusual if you make up a rumour around it, especially after being relegated to a league he obviously doesn't want to play him so the manager won't pick him in.

Having a theory of play doesn't dictate you only buy one type of player. City, Liverpool, Chelsea have very solid theories of play and have quite a range of players from fast to slow to creative and dull. They're are used for their skillsets. 

What we NEED is ONE consistent theory of play for a solid 14 months. Poch is hopefully* bringing players in to fit a system he wants and that means defenders who play out of defence with solid passing and decision making, midfielders who are of two different groups: shut down pressers and creative speed demons, denoted Eriksen as he is the maestro. Our wings are obvious. The striker is a player who can come and hold up a ball but has no issue pacing by a defender. Getting out players to play in this theory is different from Sherwood and AVB.

&gt;The __Fife Circle__ is the local [rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport) service north from [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh). It links towns of south [Fife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife) and the coastal towns along the [Firth of Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth) before heading to [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh).  Operationally, the service is not strictly a [circle route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_route), but, rather, a point to point service that reverses at the Edinburgh end, and has a large bi-directional [balloon loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_loop) at the Fife end.

One glaring mistake when both CBs went for the same ball lead to a chance for Chadli. A few other small mistakes lead to Adebayor getting into good positions but a good challenge and good pressure meant nothing really came of it.

Most impressive was the covering and protection from the midfield. Gerrard played well and when he moved wide Henderson and Allen/Can filled the centre so no space for deep runs from Spurs midfield.

At full back both Spaniards done really well. Manquillo is very solid and reminds me of Finnan/Arbeloa in the fact he's a defender first and foremost. Moreno on the opposite wing is solid but looks more of an attacking player.

One issue I would have is that Spurs' most dangerous plays all came from balls over the top or from our own poor passing from the defence. The defence still have issues when they get turned and both Sahko and Loveren can do better in finding the midfielders, but overall they coped well and as a first outing for that particular back 4, it was very encouraging.

And?

&gt; internment being imposed almost exclusively on one side of the population

This wasn't some new idea the government came up with, it had been used successfully by both the British and Irish governments. However it was executed poorly and it was wrong to disproportionately target the Catholic community. It was wrong and I'm not going to defend it.

&gt;plastic bullets being used with little regard for SOP against nationalists

If you're some 18 yo squaddie on his first tour with hundreds of people trowing shit at him he's not going to think ""Now remember to aim at the legs."" He's just gonna want to get himself out in one piece. Not trying to excuse the mishandling of a lethal weapon but it's understandable. The reason there's 16 Catholic deaths from plastic bullets compared to 1 Protestant one is that Catholics rioted far more often than Protestants did. If Protestants rioted as much as Catholics did then the numbers would be more equal.

&gt;the shoot to kill policies

There were no shoot to kill polices. The only organisations that tried to kill every time they opened fire were the paramilitaries. The army actually had to give three warnings if they saw say an IRA man with a rifle. Unless he was aiming his weapon they couldn't shoot without warnings. Of course the IRA never did anything remotely similar. 

&gt; the use of live rounds to control demonstrations

Never heard of that one before.

&gt; the transfer of arms from the BA to loyalist paramilitaries

Rogue elements were responsible for any collusion. The Army as a whole didn't supply the Loyalists. What about the thousands and thousands of pounds of explosives, bullets, guns etc that the security forces confiscated from the Loyalists? Should we ignore that and just focus on the comparatively little amount that was supplied by rogue elements?

&gt;the removal of patrols in areas where loyalists were operating

The Army did patrol Loyalist areas, for example the Shankill. Other Loyalist areas were patrolled by the RUC only because the threat was reduced in these areas. And the purpose of patrols was to disrupt the ability for the IRA to plan and execute operations and to conduct surveillance. It's not like the UVF or UDA ever prepared to mortar a police station for example so the need for patrols in Loyalist areas wasn't as strong as in Republican ones. 

&gt; handing information to loyalists

See my point about arms supply and collusion.

&gt; operating murder squads

Like? Again the Army didn't operate murder gangs, when soldiers or policemen were involved they were rogue elements who weren't a true representation of the forces as a whole.

&gt; Falls Curfew

A crash is coming, probably in the Spring - interest rates have to go up and people are dialled up to the max on mortgages anyway so you'll see foreclosures rise. When that starts to happen, people who can will decide to cash out and move out of London taking the capital out now and buying something with less debt (or much larger) outside of the capital. That will speed up a dumping on the market.

That won't stop foreign investment money coming in, nearly all the money that ""wants"" to be here right now pretty much is, so prices are starting to slow already, and I don't think enough money will flow in to adjust the effects of the above two activities. The supply/demand graph will tip, and prices will fall.

My gut instinct is next year there will be a 10% average drop in prices, and 5%/year for the following few years - that's what happened in the 1980s.

So the £500k properties around today will fall back to about £390k by 2019, which is about where they were in 2011.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"Capoue and Bentaleb are not responsible. Here's why.

Their first goal: Hugo plays a ball from the back long up the left side. Neither Chadli nor Rose deal with it and Henderson wins it. He plays it wide to Sturridge who turns Vertonghen and makes a run down the right hand side. Capoue tracks the run and holds with the natural line rather than continue as he should. Kaboul for whatever reason drops 3-4 yards deeper off the natural line rather than stepping up and easily catching Henderson off as he should. This allows the ball to Henderson to be played from Sturridge as he is onside. An additional mistake is Dier stepping centrally in the space being covered by Kaboul and allowing Sterling to gain the advantage on the far side for the easy tap in. That's exactly what happens. Capoue is not at fault for that. He did what he is supposed to do. Kaboul fucked us by dropping deeper and Dier doubly fucked us by jumping a central feint from Sterling and sliding over only to give up the back post on an easy ball across from Henderson.

Their second goal: A long ball from Mignolet is played up to Sturridge who settles it to Balotelli. Balotelli loses it under pressure from Capoue and Vertoghen. Kaboul gets the ball takes a touch and plays a shitty ball out from the back straight to Henderson. Henderson plays it wide to Sturridge who makes a meal of it and pops it up in the air. Joe Allen is there and he heads it back to Sturridge who settles it and plays it back to Allen as Lamela drops in to double down on him. Capoue switches with Dier as Dier takes Allen and Capoue follows Sturridge who makes a run along the edge of the box and to the top of the box. If Capoue doesn't track Sturridge it's an easy backpass from Allen to him for an even easier shot. Dier didn't act quick enough and so was left grasping at Allen and makes minimal contact with him causing him to go to ground to win the penalty. 

Their third goal: Capoue plays the ball wide to Dier. Dier passes it to Townsend and makes a good behind Moreno into space. Townsend makes a poor decision and opts not to play the simple and easy 1-2 to Dier down the line. He takes a shitty touch. He tries to turn him with a move that everyone knows is coming and gives up the ball easily. Moreno has the advantage and pace and charges into that entirely open space behind Townsend and Dier. Dier is not at fault. Capoue is not at fault. Townsend is. Capoue is left trying to track back and cover for Townsend's dumbass mistake and can't make up Moreno's 10-15 yard head start unsurprisingly. To add to that Capoue also has to watch the run that Sterling is making behind him and so initially runs with him hoping that Townsend can catch up to him. There is also the part where Kaboul doesn't slide over to cover the danger area and instead stays with Sturridge. Furthermore, Dembele doesn't run inside to cover Sterling to free up Capoue. Ultimately the entire blame falls directly on Townsend who attempted to be cute on the ball when he had no defensive cover if he fucked up which he did. The only other question that can be asked is why didn't Kaboul make himself available for a back pass when he saw Dier make the overlapping run. He stayed back and centrally even after he watched Townsend ignore the easy 1-2 pass to Dier. Townsend had no ready option other than Capoue to play the ball to. Townsend could have recycled things through Capoue or, had Kaboul made himself an option, could have dropped it to Kaboul. Townsend is really the only responsible party for their third goal.

Also, you don't have to play with wingers to terrorize the wings. That isn't a requirement. It just requires finding space on the outside that is available which they did on all 3 occasions.

Whenever I see a thread that mentions our ''CM's'' and who should go - Holtby is mentioned. Holtby isn't a CM. iS Gotze a CM? No. I've said it 10000 times, but I still think people are judging Holtby (rightfully so, as he got stuck there) as a CM, and not what he can do at AMC. Yes, he has an engine that gives the illusion he can play at CM. Yes, he's all over the pitch if needs be and can drop deeper if needs be. Yes, he said ''I can play 6 or 8 role'' - more to appease AVB I bet with his 4-3-3. But long short of it is - he's a AMC. 

It's like saying ''man, Henry is medicore'' if you saw him for Juve on the wing. Or Bale being a medicore LB, in a 16 odd game losing streak. I feel Lewis had SO much more to offer - and if WORSE comes to worse, he's AMC cover and energy from the bench. Now, we lack that. Say Eriksen is injured or burnt out. Lamela will be playing most games too, so him in the centre? Chadli I would imagine after his start will be playing more too - so who is our backup? Kane at AMC? Really? We're a side trying for top 6 even, and that's not good enough.

Neither Townsend nor Lennon are good enough for Spurs. My ideal set up would have been Eriksen on the left, Holtby AMC hussling and hassling which Eriksen ISN'T as good at and Lamela on the right. He played that for Ajax in a 4-3-3, he can play that in a 4-2-3-1. He will still get a lot of the ball. Eriksen got marked out the game, and was ineffective at AMC. At AML, he'd find his own space, he can cross (think Man Utd and Ade's goal) still be playing extremely central and stretching the defense ('Pool looked stable as fuck). 

Now what do we do? It's a ridiculous move. I bet my balls on if Holtby was played at AMC, in a role like he had at Schalke, he'd notch at least 5+ goals and 5+ assists easily in the EPL. Easily.

That seems some what contradictory, you imply that a lot of ground will be covered, but then suggest kids may not be up to learning ""that much"".

I think Eriksen is just as good at AML. Look at his heatmaps, or the player average positions recently - we're basically playing 3 AMC's with the full backs giving the width. It's not like Eriksen would see none of the ball, and he ''coped'' just fine at AML for Ajax - didn't he?

I'm not saying Holtby &gt; Eriksen. But I'm saying Holtby &gt; Townsend, Chadli, Lennon. I also think Holtby doesn't get the credit he deserves - again, I'm not saying he's better than Eriksen at all but he was doing things in a tougher league than Eriksen was.

I might make a video on him with all his moments, especially ones people may not have seen at Schalke.

Why does it matter if we have more in common with Scotland and Wales than we do the rest of England (if indeed that is even the case)? We are all part of the UK. So what if our bit is a more like a bit at the other end than it is like a bit in the middle? Do you think Yorkshire is exactly like Hampshire? Is County Durham just like Kent? No. 

I would add to that though, that Devon really isn't that different. Nor is Somerset. Go over the bridge once in a while. 

What we really need is for the government in London to recognise that Cornwall and the South West in general is a real place where actual people actually live and not just a nice place for them to go on their holidays. 

I do agree that some of the arguments for Scottish independence are similar to those for Cornish independence. However, they are arguments that betray an insular view and a wilful ignorance of the world outside your own area. Interests not adequately represented in Parliament? Welcome to ANYWHERE BUT THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND!

Personally, if someone brings up Cornish independence I would tend to assume that they are either joking or that they have absolutely concept of reality.

I'll give reasons.

J Rod looked good at Burnley. One of those...you know the sorts, could do well at a Prem club, but nothing special. He was good for his level. Came in to the EPL, had a Kevin Phillips-esque season (for those who don't know, Phillips got promoted to the EPL, scored 30 odd goals and IIRC won the top scorer). I'm not convinced 100% by him, but somebody could prove me wrong. Anyway, add now a ACL injury which means he may never be the same again. Ever. And even if we sign him, that's a LONG wait for him to recover, feel strong, gain match sharpness and force his way in. We don't have that time to wait.,

Welbeck. Decent striker. Not good on the wing, imo - from what I've seen. Pretty poor at the WC in Woys weird Welbeck on the wing formation thing. Doesn't strike me as a great player - more like a Livermore style player for us that plays for Utd. Never ''wow'd me'' and think he would be just as bad as Townsend on the wing. Which leads too...

Townsend. Fuck off and leave now.

I'm guessing you have no idea what a house search actually entails. If you did, you would understand why they were such a problem for nationalists.

&gt; This wasn't some new idea the government came up with, it had been used successfully by both the British and Irish governments. However it was executed poorly and it was wrong to disproportionately target the Catholic community. It was wrong and I'm not going to defend it.

You and I have *very* different understandings of the term 'successful'. But since you accept it was wrong, how does this fit in with your 'pig in the middle' narrative?

&gt; If you're some 18 yo squaddie on his first tour with hundreds of people trowing shit at him he's not going to think ""Now remember to aim at the legs."" He's just gonna want to get himself out in one piece. Not trying to excuse the mishandling of a lethal weapon but it's understandable. The reason there's 16 Catholic deaths from plastic bullets compared to 1 Protestant one is that Catholics rioted far more often than Protestants did. If Protestants rioted as much as Catholics did then the numbers would be more equal.

Yeah, firing plastic bullets as children from the back of a moving land rover is an attempt to get yourself home in one piece.

&gt; There were no shoot to kill polices. The only organisations that tried to kill every time they opened fire were the paramilitaries. The army actually had to give three warnings if they saw say an IRA man with a rifle. Unless he was aiming his weapon they couldn't shoot without warnings. Of course the IRA never did anything remotely similar. 

This is an outright lie. If you actually want to learn about the subject I suggest you start here..

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-to-kill_policy_in_Northern_Ireland

&gt; The Army did patrol Loyalist areas, for example the Shankill. Other Loyalist areas were patrolled by the RUC only because the threat was reduced in these areas. And the purpose of patrols was to disrupt the ability for the IRA to plan and execute operations and to conduct surveillance. It's not like the UVF or UDA ever prepared to mortar a police station for example so the need for patrols in Loyalist areas wasn't as strong as in Republican ones. 

I'm talking about the various times that BA/RUC patrols in Nationalist areas were called off, to allow Loyalist squads to operate freely for a short period of time, have a look at the murder of Miriam Daly for a particularly blatant and gruesome example.

&gt; Never heard of that one before.

You've never heard of Bloody Sunday?

&gt; Rogue elements were responsible for any collusion. The Army as a whole didn't supply the Loyalists. What about the thousands and thousands of pounds of explosives, bullets, guns etc that the security forces confiscated from the Loyalists? Should we ignore that and just focus on the comparatively little amount that was supplied by rogue elements?

Well, thats fine, I suppose we can just dismiss the large body of evidence, stretching back over 40 years, to the actions of a few bad apples. We can also ignore the role of the UDR as a de facto bridge between the BA and loyalists, again, because bad apples.

It's much more complicated. If it was strictly a cultural and religion, then ""rape gangs"" would be happening in other countries/places where Pakistani Muslims are a minority, like America, etc. But it's not. 

The factor you're missing is its not the culture of Pakistanis and/or Muslims in general, but the culture in Pakistani **ghettos**, like in Bradford etc. These are areas that have gangs of ""gangsta rudeboys"". When you get a group of shitty people together, shitty things happen.

There are countless examples of people belonging to the same culture and religion in other parts of the UK but with no ghetto/gang culture - and from experience it's absolutely no where near as toxic.

As far as I can tell the facts are not disputed. He arrived and asked for his phone back, the crazed lunatic with over 10 previous violent convictions stabbed him in the eye first. It's only after being stabbed in the eye did he then stab the guy to death.

So you can retract the below comment as it's clearly bollocks. Feel free to make a different point though.

I'm probably using the wrong words here, but the show a more....unified feel to it under Davis that Moffat has largely done away with. I kinda agree with the ""Fanfiction"" claim from the article to an extent, at least with the Amy/Rory run of the series (I've enjoyed things far more since Clara came around). 

Who knows, maybe I'm still sore over the fact that Moffatt essentially retconned the whole damn Davis run in his first episode (It happened, but only he remembers now? Fuck that.)

For the record I'm not a Moffatt hater, I prefer Davis style I guess (though his writing can be awful).

Bad analogy. Horses are not practical for some of the uses we could task a motor-vehicle to - there's a good reason people don't use them daily. 

Motor-vehicles however remain *too* practical for every day use from taking the kids to school to doing a big shopping run to getting to your office on a business park outside your town.

One can argue visiting someone who's stolen something to ask for it back isn't too outlandish.

- The police are equipped to deal with, and are experienced, with physical violence

1) While I don't believe that JRod is worth 28m, I also don't believe Townsend is worth 14m, so there's some number fudging there we shouldn't be basing assumptions off of

2) I think people forget how good JRod was before his injury. He came from nowhere to play himself as a shoe-in for the England squad. In contrast, Townsend played himself out. I believe we won't become a CL standard club without another high quality winger/forward, and I don't think Townsend is the answer. Which brings me to point three.

3) We will not get Griezmann quality players without being in the CL.

4) JRod carries less tactical risk which makes him more expensive. Outside of the ""premier league experience"" cliche and the English premium, we **know** he can play in Poch's system.

When Cameron won Tory leadership he promised to leave the European Democrats group, to appease Eurosceptics. Nine years later, he could have vetoed Juncker if he stayed.

In Jan­u­ary 2013 Cameron pro­posed the EU ref­er­en­dum bill, but only two years earlier Cameron said no to a referendum on Europe.

&gt; Pol­ish Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs Radosław Siko­rski re­cently noted, full and frank, that Cameron has re­peat­edly demon­strated his in­com­pe­tence in Eu­ro­pean af­fairs: “He does not get it, he be­lieves in the stu­pid pro­pa­ganda, he stu­pidly tries to play the sys­tem.” The British leader should have tried to con­vince peo­ple as op­posed to feed­ing scraps to the scep­tics.

The fact we have also voted in a large portion of UKIP MEPs, and then they dont even show up to parliament half the time. How can we reform Europe when Britain acts like such a spoilt brat. Cameron trys to play the system and fails horribly, UKIP supporters want reform but dont work towards it.

""In London, of course, we have congestion charging – and, for a couple years, it was great. So what we need now is smarter congestion charging, nationwide. Congestion charging which is not a flat rate, but a rate that rises and falls until it reaches the right level to keep traffic moving. At 6am on Sunday, even in London it’ll be cheap; at 8:00 on Monday, in urban areas, it’ll be prohibitive.

""Rural roads would end up costing peanuts most the time and of course, we’d exempt certain people, such as doctors, pensioners and the disabled. Some people might find alternatives or plan their jobs and lives differently. Some of the money raised would replace or reduce tax on petrol and some might be used to improve roads and public transport and introduce proper bike lanes to ensure that everyone has a transport option But that really is the size of it. You want to drive more in crowded places, you pay more – and if you can’t afford it, we’ll provide you with good quality alternatives.""

I agree that it isn't an equivalent comparison, especially if (as it seems right now) the gangs were helped or this was 'hushed up'  by powerful figures within the community and people using the power of the community within Rochdale (and the other places). That is a big difference to me,  none of the rage killers etc had any kind of support like that and also places where abusers did have institutional enablers (The Isle of Wight, the catholic church's various scandals, the BBC/entertainment etc for Savile etc) have had huge inquests and soul searchings or at least similar efforts to the OP. 


imo (as well as endogamy and awful Victorian style clandestine traditions) an in-goup/out-group relationship between communities Pakistani Muslim/white and Pakistani Muslim/Sikh etc in these places maybe had something to do with this. I think you may be lumping in lots of semi related communities together here under the 'Pakistani Muslim' label. Have there been Pakistani communities that haven't had any of these things happen, I haven't heard anything about London's large Pakistani community (though that may come out in the future) perhaps this is because there is less of an ingroup/outgoup relationship with other groups and also because Pakistani communities form London have different, less rural, parent regions.

**The 2nd Doctor:**

A 16 year old me with no proper guidance wasn't very wise and I decided to leave college as it felt like I was being treated like a school kid and with £30 a week but in a job I was treated like an adult with £200 a week with paid holidays etc and all the benefits of being employed. 

I'm still doing that job now because when I was young no one else would accept someone who wanted to leave college and I went to join the navy but failed a medical due to a problem I had at 14/15 and there was a chance it can come back any time (depression through a hard childhood) , I now work six days a week, had to register as self employed to keep my job for a measly £348 a week with no benefits whatsoever other than a tax return once a year. 

I'm burning out physically and mentally that in 8 years my wages have only increased ever so slightly. 

It was my fault and my fault only that I got into this situation.

I do feel as though companies ( I'm in the construction industry) shouldn't be able to have there employees self employed cause really I'm not, I still have to do exactly what I was doing but now with less fucking rights. I can't take days off to spend with my girlfriend, family or friends that often because its a choice of be paid or don't and the only day off is a sunday which by that point my body is exhausted from being out for 12 hours with physical work for £60 a fucking day.

If you had a car that did 30MPG and drove 320 miles a week, that'd be £63 a week. 47 weeks per year (standard working weeks) would mean you'd be spending £3k a year on fuel, so over two years for payback if you got a car that used absolutely no fuel at all.

Using this: http://www.which.co.uk/cars/driving/driver-tools/petrol-vs-diesel/petrol-and-diesel-fuel-costs/

That gives a payback time of 10 years, assuming you go from 30mpg petrol to 50mpg diesel.

true,themedes,cnty-england,Cambridge,"i agree, ive commented on this before. look at the clusterfuck which is ICT. 

Programming is more about problem solving, and is a slow laborious process of guesswork, retrying and then retrying again. The foundations of programming are heavily founded in mathematics, a subject which is commonly seen as ""boring"". Without a good grounding in the subjects core foundations, then i can only see another ICT clusterfuck waiting to happen.  Also teaching problem solving skills is seriously hard to do, as its often the case that some people see things in different lights. kids often lose interest very quickly if they cant do it quickly, so this kills off genuine interest quickly.

Computing and programming are in an inherently fast moving industry, something which i feel most syllabus' will struggle to keep up with. can you imagine a differing flavour of web technology every 12 months being reworked into a new syllabus, teachers learning the newest trends every 6 months? this will probably end with kids trotting out API calls parrot fashion to pass exams, and hardly understanding why or what is happening in an abstract notion, or really applying ideas to use such API's. 

Also there is the notion of finding great programmers as teachers. who will leave a £50k/pa job to go teach for £25-30k/pa, more than likely no one will. then you get into the situation where you have less able teachers teaching a subject they are not fully versed in. something i feel should not happen, and looks like it has happened with ICT to some extent.

like the above poster, im self taught, and didnt touch any schooling on the subject until University, where i did full Comp Sci. i am naturally good at maths/science, and have always had an inquisitive mind when it comes to tech, and stuff. if i did a-level computing i possibly would have been put off. my friend did it and they did pascal, this seemed really basic to me, so i ignored this when i learnt to code, and learnt C with TurboC compiler on my own from about 16 onwards. never looked back, people get worried about pointers? i love em.",0,1409588644,null,0,1409588830,0,ck6bodw,t3_2f5upl,t1_ck6bodw,t1_ck6aexs,null,1427254676,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Capoue will know and assume he's not the last man, he's not trying to play him off, he's just let him run and let the defender get goalside to let a simple cross in. You don't assume you're the last man unless you're playing in the defensive line. He wasn't, he should have been covering the runners.

2. ""Capoue switches with Dier"", no he doesn't, he just gets done. He doesn't think allen will move on his left foot and gets fooled and as a result moves on to marking Sturridge cos he's lost his man. If you look at it Capoue is looking at Allen the entire time, not where sturridge is moving, then lets his man slip on the outside whilst getting left flat-footed. You're looking for excuses here.

3. You've just brought to attention the fact that it was Capoue not Dembele as I previously thought for the third. Sandro would have stopped Moreno there, I'm fairly confident (I obviously can't know this, but I think he'd have cottoned on to the danger faster and made the block/tackle). You can lose the ball on the wing and still stop their left back from scoring. If you're willing to criticise Kaboul for this goal (and many have) then you should be willing to criticise Capoue.

&gt; Townsend is really the only responsible party for their third goal.

No he's not, you can lose the ball in the opposition half whilst your full back is out of position and still not have their left back score. The CDM's cover those positions when that happens.

They were a pain in arse yes but they were also done to Loyalist suspects as well and every single counter-terrorist operation has house searches in them. Should the army have gone against all wisdom and not have conducted house searches?

&gt; You and I have very different understandings of the term 'successful'. But since you accept it was wrong, how does this fit in with your 'pig in the middle' narrative?

Because life isn't a comic book. No side in a conflict is totally good and no side is totally bad. Just because I 'support' the army doesn't mean I look at them with rose tinted glasses and say to myself they never once did anything wrong and were always right.

&gt; Yeah, firing plastic bullets as children from the back of a moving land rover is an attempt to get yourself home in one piece.

Those two examples, while being from a biased source, are murder. I'm not afraid to say that and the soldiers responsible should be brought to justice. 

&gt;This is an outright lie. If you actually want to learn about the subject I suggest you start here..
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-to-kill_policy_in_Northern_Ireland[3]

I actually read that before my original response to you. It is the extreme few examples that are held up as examples of a service wide policy. If there was a genuine shoot to kill policy (like the Phoenix Program in Vietnam for example) there would be far more contentious cases.

&gt;I'm talking about the various times that BA/RUC patrols in Nationalist areas were called off, to allow Loyalist squads to operate freely for a short period of time, have a look at the murder of Miriam Daly for a particularly blatant and gruesome example.

First I've heard of this and there's very little information about it on the internet so I can't comment.

&gt;You've never heard of Bloody Sunday?

One example out of thousands. As I've said before Bloody Sunday was absolutely wrong and the soldiers involved should be brought to justice.

&gt;Well, thats fine, I suppose we can just dismiss the large body of evidence, stretching back over 40 years, to the actions of a few bad apples. We can also ignore the role of the UDR as a de facto bridge between the BA and loyalists, again, because bad apples.

The wikipedia article again gives examples of soldiers individually colluding with paramilitaries but the actual organisation that was the Army didn't. That's the point I'm trying to make: soldiers individually colluded but did the powers at be sit round and say: ""Ahh we could use those UDA ones, let's arm them and supply them with info.""? No, they didn't.

&gt;Excessive population of an area to the point of overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, or environmental deterioration.


Resource use is a component of overpopulation. A set of resources can support different numbers of people, depending on the resources used per person.


Also your argument about grazing animals ignores opportunity cost. Humans can't eat grass but unless you're limiting cattle to mountain goats, you could be using that land to farm plants, producing far far more food than grazing animals for meat.


Population control is something that needs to be seriously addressed, but to say that diet isn't a big factor in resource consumption is, well...

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Is it just a tax evasion thing?

It is.

Instead of you working for Company A, then Company B, then Company C what they do is have you employed by Company U^^(mbrella) which is sub-contracted to A/B/C.

The Umbrella company then pays you a shit wage but *over*-pays expenses for the costs of you moving between A/B/C. So what might happen is that although the job is advertised as £20,000/year what you find on your pay slip week to week is £15,000/year actual wage and £5,000/year worth of expenses. 

There are tax reliefs for expenses payments as well as no National Insurance contributions to be made for them.

&gt; It sounds too good to be true?

Well here's the unfortunate thing. For most people it isn't, they just get their weird pay slips and HMRC goes after the employer for it. 

*but* I've just told you how it works and when you know what's going on you become liable in the eyes of HMRC. So, sorry.",0,1409589463,null,0,false,0,ck6c0ea,t3_2f6fu7,t1_ck6c0ea,t3_2f6fu7,null,1427254521,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Jaqacake,null,null,"You can get stuck in a trap, as a school leaver with no experience you can get a shit job because you don't have to be paid as much as someone over 21. At my first job it was well known that everyone lost their jobs as they approached their 18th birthday (if they hadn't quit by then), because you can't pay an 18 year old £3 an hour. 

Over 21 and no experience becomes very hard, because if it's a shitty job they can hire someone with the same lack of experience who is under 21 for less. If you're going to pay the extra for someone over 21, there will be dozens of applicants with experience.

The longer you go without a job, the harder it is to get one, I'd advise not leaving it blank. I will call someone back if they are otherwise right and have explained a year gap in that they have been looking for work (I see this a lot). I've given someone a job who explained his gap because he was in prison. I've got to be really desperate to call someone with an unexplained gap to ask them about it, given most will make some attempt. I only recruit for shit jobs though. 

A shit job can be more than it appears - I said I only get the recruit shit jobs, and always temporary. What I am not allowed to tell you is that that shit temporary job can become permanent and less shit. In the past people we've hired on that basis have gone on to do qualifications, trade apprenticeships, or become managers. A lot of companies will mainly recruit at entry level and train people up the ladder. 

Do something - a volunteer position is massively better than nothing. An evening a week somewhere can really help, it doesn't need to be in a shop. I help at a guide group, we are perpetually short of volunteers. I'm shortly due to start a volunteer position at a local college. There are local youth groups everywhere, organisations like st John's ambulance are always recruiting, friends have had volunteer positions in hospitals and at an animal shelter. If you've been unemployed for a few years something like this could make a world of difference because it shows you have some of the attributes employers are looking for and mean you have a relevant reference (someone who taught you a few years ago isn't really relevant).  When I'm recruiting for positions that don't need experience volunteering is as good as a job. 

Large companies probably don't care about your age if you've no experience and usually have a structured career ladder - banks or bookies if you're OK at maths or shops, supermarkets, fast food outlets, etc. Outside of a city most pubs don't care for experience, all my early jobs were just got by asking in the local pub and being prepared to work weekends, no cv or application or anything but I suspect it's a bit harder now that there are so many people with experience also looking. None of these will advertise on the job centre site, you need to visit the websites of the individual companies. If you have a friend who works for a big company I'm told you generally stand a better chance with some if you've been referred by a current employee. 

Direct marketing is a terrible, terrible job but they will take anyone, I mean you've got to be desperate, they are horrible companies to work for and there may be no guaranteed income, they are the adverts that are very vague, promising big rewards for hard work but never giving any suggestion of what the job is.

It sucks, you can't get a job because you've no experience because you can't get a job. I wish there was an easy answer.",0,1409589503,null,0,false,0,ck6c0xo,t3_2f5nz2,t1_ck6c0xo,t3_2f5nz2,null,1427254514,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

true,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,"Mathematically it's fairly simple.

If you reduced your taxable income to about £10,000 you'd stand to gain about £60,000 between income tax and national insurance.  *(This would also require the complicity of your employer.)*

So, your maximum net benefit is approximately £60,000 less the cost of the avoidance scheme.  If it were a financial product we'd make an adjustment to the net figure for the probability of success.  Then all that's left is the issue of your appetite for risk.

If you earned £250,000 you could reduce your tax bill by about £45,000 by reducing your taxable income to £150,000.  I'm not in a position to say what the cost would be, or what the chance of success is.

**However** HMRC's new'ish power to make you pay the disputed tax up front changes the whole state of play.

It used to be that you could avoid, say, £100,000 and keep the money until your scheme was defeated.  This could be the best part of a decade.  You probably wouldn't be charged a penalty and the interest you'd pay would probably be less than you'd have earned just sticking the cash in a current account.  You almost couldn't lose.

Now you'll pay the cost of implementing the scheme **and** pay the tax.  You may get it back a few years down the line.  But you're out of pocket the entire time.  You only gain if your scheme is successful.  If your scheme fails you have to pay the tax and you spent money on a dud scheme and you'll have costs in relation to handling the enquiries.

This doesn't change any any level of income under the new rules.  It boils down to how willing you are to gamble.  What makes that gamble blind is that the people who know how likely to succeed the scheme is - the scheme promoters - Are incentivised to tell you it's definitely all ok.

Now, all that said, look into Self Invested Pension Plans.  (SIPPs)  That might be something that works for you and is legitimate tax planning.

Despite the fact that Tennant was a brilliant Doctor, one of the best, I still find some of the episodes too hard to watch. I know Doctor Who is built on cheesy sci-fi, but damn, a lot of the episodes are just plain terrible.

Whereas Moffatt came in, and in my opinion, changed the show for the better. He chose to introduce his own villains instead of the ones that have been recycled for 50 years, and made narrative changes that kept the show fresh and interesting. Even his bad episodes still have solid concepts behind them, it's his execution that's the problem sometimes.

I can't cook either, but I have a go.

Something easy is fried rice. Boil up some rice, add some frozen veggies to it when it's half done. Chop up some mushroom, onion and bacon. Drain the rice and veg. Put a dash of oil in a frying pan, brown the onion and mushroom, then add the rice, veg and bacon. Sprinkle some spices over it if you like (I usually use garlic salt and curry powder), then just stir until the bacon is cooked.

Or spaghetti bolognese. Spaghetti in boiling water. Put a dash of oil in a pan, and put mince, chopped onion, chopped mushroom, chopped garlic, a dash of olive oil and a can or two of chopped tomatoes (depending on the amount of mince) into it.

true,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat  | /r/LibDem,"&gt; it's possible to extrapolate a solution from these quotes i've pulled out without wooly references to the 50's and draconian rhetoric is it not?

It certainly is. But it's not really being done all that effectively by the people shouting about it on the right. 

UKIP, in particular, are singularly awful at controlling their more shrill anti-PC advocates- their noble campaign against ""Political Correctness"" seems to come down to, in the public view, fighting for the right to parade Gollywogs about with pride and call their neighbours ""poofters"". 

That's not campaigning against excesses like we've seen here- it's fighting for wider societal acceptance of people being arseholes.

&gt;I would also put it to you. That Multiculturalism since it was ramped up proper during our new labour years has been horrifically mismanaged, bungled and royally screwed up by the British Labour party, they were at it from 1997-2010 and they've sown immense discord through our streets...this is not the fault of the various cultures and peoples and i'm not blaming them, but it is how i see it.

Mismanaged? Maybe. But I think the issue's too complex to comment on in such simplistic terms as are being tossed about by the tabloids- for every one Rotherham perpetrator, there are *hundreds* of upstanding British Muslim members of the community- who, if not fully integrated right now, will integrate within a generation or two. And we're already seeing that happen.

Fuel duty... for the very people who would be buying the fuel to put in their cars that they then go on to drive in congestion charge areas? 

Am I missing something here - because that sounds like moving money around without actually solving any problems (though knowing the government it would probably result in making driving even more costly - forcing more people to use any of the alternative monopoly services (bus / train). 

In other words - punishing commuters for trying to get to work. 

&gt; As for taking the kids to school - why can't they get the bus, walk or cycle?

Well I don't know about everyone else but my school was on the far side of town - a good 1 1/2 hours walk away for little legs - *or* cycling along main roads *or* several buses as there was no direct route from my home to the school... not forgetting that come December it'll be dark in both directions making roads more dangerous (and parents understandably concerned for the well-fare of their child as they walk some distance on their own in the dark). 

In other words - not exactly ideal (by a long shot).

Your local adult education website will probably tell you. 

Most employers won't notice the missing GCSEs if you've got A-levels, although some will require a C in maths and English (although you'd assume an A-level in English would mean that's not needed for you).  As for uni, if you're a mature student you may be able to get away with missing academic qualifications, I'm not sure how it works or if you even go through UCAS but I had friends at uni with no A-levels. 

Just another thought, have you tried seasonal work? PGL, JCA, and the like will start recruiting at the start of the year, ski season is recruiting now.

You get paid very little but you are housed and fed, it's a great experience, a lot of fun and gives you the all important experience for your CV.

It's evident beyond any reasonable doubt that the community in question in Rotherham has some very serious issues that are not compatible with UK norms and laws at present.  The idea that throwing a handful of offenders in jail will solve the issue is overly simplistic - there needs to be a lot more done to force fundamental changes, even if that means a relatively imposing state helping the saner members of the local society to bring others into the modern age.

Does the same problem exist in other locations, even to a lesser degree?  It wouldn't surprise me to find that it does, and hopefully the amount of stirring done by the media in this case will help to bring those that do exist to light in the same way as Saville's legacy has.  It doesn't need to be Pakistani muslims either - although that could be left unsaid.  I would say that issues of this type and extent indicate a very sick community - at the scale being discussed - but raise an objection when an attempt is made to extrapolate to similar communities solely on the basis of ethnic origin and religion.

Our new signings over the last couple of transfer windows have been more miss than hit and we're badly missing Brown and Forrest. Having said that, the fact we're missing those two so badly shows how little real depth there is in the squad. Young McGregor has come in and done a job but we've seen youngsters come in and shine for a few games only to fall back as quickly as they came, Watt and McGeoch spring to mind. 

What is apparent is we're not in the market for even Championship level players anymore, our scouting network isn't unearthing the number of players we have in the past and Delia seems to have been well down the list of preferred managerial candidates. Clearly those approached have taken a look at what they'd have to work with and found it lacking. The other thing thats clear is Lennon is a better manager than a lot of people gave him credit for. 

Maybe Lawell is holding back cash to invest when Rangers rejoin the Premiership but the reality is I think Rangers being out of the league has hurt our bottom line and the motivation of our fans and players more than we'd like to admit.

Having spent some time on farms this is not true. Directly yes but indirectly we kill a lot of unwanted .

In egg production male chicks have no use. They can't lay eggs and growing them for meat isn't possible. So we kill the chicks after they are sexed.

Capaldi has the chops to bring the character to life and so far he's been nothing short of amazing, but here's the thing - 12 is something totally new for us who've followed mostly the newer series (I'm just scrapping the surface of the Classic episodes). 

With 9, 10 and 11 we knew where we were at. They all had their questionable moments, but we all knew that they were good guys. We always knew that they had some kind of plan to make everything much, much less terrible than it might seem. There would be a moment of fright like ""Holy crap, what is he doing? That's a bad thing to do! Why would the Doctor do something bad?!"" and then it would be revealed that they were playing a part or executing a plan all along and we'd all collectively go 'phew' and then laugh and be like 'yeah, I knew it all along!'

With Capaldi there are still those moments and more intense, but the 'phew' moment comes by harder and harder and there might be a time where it never comes at all. So in terms of a new-series Doctor, Capaldi is something completely new, from a different 'mold' of character, so to speak, and it will be a while before we have him figured out completely.

He's a fine actor and a true Doctor Who fan who brings a lot of the Classic Doctor Who traits to the role. A bit more alien, very powerful, but with a sly wit and subtle humor that shows his brain is simply moving faster than everyone else in the room.

And yes, he, like #12, is still feeling out this new role a bit, and developing his own place in it.

As for the quality of longer story arcs, look to the showrunner for that. Moffat's great with writing individual episodes (The Angels Take Manhattan, The Girl In The Fireplace, Blink, etc.), but he's kinda weak on series-long story arcs. That's not to say he can't do it, but he's just better focusing on smaller, more contained episodes than trying to play with an idea for a whole series.

This is the problem with this country in general really, most space is given to the motorist and cities have been designed with the motorist in mind. This is a mistake we have made time and time again and will never learn from. 

The Netherlands solved it and have excellent cycling infrastructure. We'll never do the same because the motorist lobby is so powerful here.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; If people still need to drive to work, they can either petition employers for flexible working hours or they can get involved in a car share scheme to split the cost with others who also need to drive. Or they can just shoulder the extra cost.

The thing I'm still struggling with is that everywhere you turn around here (and in the media, and on the street) there's talk of a) How awful public transport is and b) how we as people are being squeezed and hard during these times of austerity. 

Fuel costs are rising - but so are train fares to the extent that it's costing literally thousands to make it in to London year on year. 

All these squeezes and there's no talk of relieving the pressure. Let's assume that car sharing and flexible working hours are not feasible: there's nobody for you to car share with and your work requires you to start during peak times which is not unusual (even with some leeway). 

If that's the case your only other option is 'shoulder the extra cost'. 

I'm absolutely happy to strive for greater efficiency and environmental sustainability but although we can all do our part in that, it's also a *fantastic* way for opportunist companies / services to lock us in to costly ways of living because the alternative is not green. 

Again the alternatives are not necessarily *cheap* and therein lies the problem for people being squeezed for cash. You'll have your cleaner, clearer roads but at the cost of what... well jobs presumably as getting to work becomes economically too much to bear and there's no sign of any decrease in public transport costs. 

You mention 'you are conflating reducing unnecessary car journeys with getting rid of cars completely' - but these *are* necessary car journeys. If anything the ones where people have to commute in order to work are amongst the most necessary of all - they're the ones that can't be avoided. If you want to work - you must be able to get to your place of work. 

If public transport and motoring is too expensive and (as is the case for people across the country) it's not possible to walk or cycle - what then? ",0,1409593316,null,0,false,0,ck6dkne,t3_2f6678,t1_ck6dkne,t1_ck6dd4b,null,1427253791,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Spurs have just loaned out Holtby leaving them incredibly short at CAM (only Eriksen). Like United, they also have a new manager that will take a while to get his team playing the way he wants. Probably the worst off of our competitors as they only have Eriksen and Lamela as top players.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; I think you may be lumping in lots of semi related communities together here under the 'Pakistani Muslim' label. Have there been Pakistani communities that haven't had any of these things happen, I haven't heard anything about London's large Pakistani community

The point I am making his that the culture within these isolated Pakistani communities, things like how women are seen in relation to men, and what an appropriate age for a girl to have a relationship with a man is, are all contributing factors as to why this abuse happened in these communities. No one is for a second saying that all Pakistani men in the UK are Paedophiles, that would be ridiculous, and is obviously untrue.

What I am saying is that the culture within these communities makes it easier for people to be paedophiles and child abusers if they choose to be. It is much easier to set up a gang that sexually abuses children in an area where there are many people that believe that girls can have relationships very young, and women are inferior to men. 

It would be much harder to set up a gang like that in a white working class area for example, where being labelled a paedophile will likely get you killed. 

I think it is reasonable to make this judgement on these isolated Pakistani communities, because I am not singling them out, we make this sort of judgement all the time. When TV hosts from the 70s started being found guilty of similar crimes, we all agreed that it was the culture of television production in the 70s, that said that these stars were untouchable and could do what they wanted, that was a contributing factor. 

When Priests were being found guilty of raping boys, we all agreed that it was the culture within the church that played a big part. 

Why then is it unreasonable to say that it was the cultural upbringing of these men that played a part in why they committed these crimes, when so much evidence show it to be the case.

It's one of the dangerous of a technological age and like Gervais I in no way condone the hacking / theft / privacy intrusion. However because celebrities are exactly that - famous, iconic people - they in particular will be targets for this kind of crime. 

The vigilant person will make it difficult by taking precautions. That's good preventative advice for the future and whilst the message (as always) should be 'don't hack other people's stuff' - would it not be good sense to make it as difficult as possible to be 'got' ? 

I'm reminded of when Jeremy Clarkson bragged that identity theft was a sham and [posted his bank details in a paper](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jan/07/personalfinancenews.scamsandfraud) - he had £500 sent to charity on his behalf by someone who took the bait. 

The point being that Clarkson made it easy to make himself a target. He practical *did* ask for it. He made it easy. 

Now Lawrence etc. did *not* ask for it - but they did make it easy and again they're iconic celebrities. If anyone is going to be a target of value, it's going to be them. That's not their fault, it's what happens when you're a worldwide star. So in that - Gervais is quite correct - if you're an iconic star (or indeed anyone), don't make it easy for people to commit cyber crime against you.

I wouldn't say it was contradictory.

I can't wait to see how our other signings perform too, I have a feeling they will also be absolute bargains that will improve the team immensely.

Pochettino has his own unique idea on how to set-up a team and I think he needs time to fully gauge how well our current bunch fit the system. I can see a much more active window next summer where Pochettino can really finish moulding the squad into what he wants.

Very few of us were expecting to challenge for the title this year anyway, we can put in a worthy challenge for the top four and perhaps have a great run in the Europa Cup too. 

The most important thing this year is for the team to start playing the football we all enjoy, we have been starved of good football under AVB and tactics Tim, I really like the style Pochettino is trying to impress on the team.

I did one season (summer in the UK) when I was 20, I was one of the youngest there, most were mid 20's, with a few people over 30, so age isn't an issue.  I've known a few friends do ski seasons but I can't remember if they paid to get out there (the recruiting is generally done in the UK by UK companies).  An ex did a summer season with PGL in France and they paid his travel out there (although he was placed in the UK before and after).  It might be not be so suitable if you're not overly outgoing though, the recruitment and training I went through did seem to demand confidence and 'bubblyness' or whatever.

With regards to uni you're old enough to be a mature student, a lot of uni's will consider mature students without qualifications and you'd get full loan and grant (you're old enough that they won't take your parent's income into account), although I suspect you'd have to demonstrate some skills or a portfolio, it probably depends on degree.  If you went to uni it would essentially give you a clean slate and your time unemployed would be largely forgotten, employers can't ask your age and mostly aren't concerned with what you did before, they'd assume you were younger based on your graduation year but are unlikely to care.

So many entry level jobs require an outgoing personality to an extent, I suppose because they are mostly customer service based. 

I wish there was an easy answer, it really sucks for people in your position.  Can you try to learn new skills (er, in all that spare time you have after spending all day at the job centre), or build up a portfolio, you've done some design stuff and are good at photography, although I assume it'd be easier to get a job in some kid of design area than photography.

Don't restrict yourself to the job centre site, use other sites as well as gumtree and such (or even advertise on gumtree, you said you failed to get hired as a cleaner, but you could try advertising cleaning services on gumtree or something, that's where we got our cleaner from).

The Jay Report reveals that the child abuse in Rotherham had multiple causes. 

The root cause was that children from the underclass, in local authority care or from dysfunctional families are treated as completely expendable. We've seen this in other serious cases of abuse, for example at the Bryn Estyn children's home at Wrexham, where the local authority sacked whistle-blowers and pulped a report partly because they were worried about their insurance cover. 

The concerns expressed about community cohesion and racism have to be seen in that context. No-one was going to rock the boat or risk their career just for some children considered as chav scum.

This was exploited by local Pakistani Muslims because they could get their mates elected to the council, and because they could rely on their community to close ranks. 

The police could and should have put a stop to all this. It's not clear why they didn't. During the New Labour years the public sector was increasing subjected to a tick box regime, so the explanation could be as simple as ""you get what you measure"". They weren't willing to damage their performance indicators for the sake of some underclass kids in care. There might also have been corruption: this needs to be urgently investigated. 

There may well be other groups of Pakistani Muslim abusers. There certainly are other abusers of some type or other. Sort out the way kids in care are looked after, and most of these abusers will be put out of business.

Current UK spending for the fiscal year of 2013/14 is 720 Billion in expenses, with only £612 Billion in tax receipts. That's a huge gap, and shows a huge amount of borrowing - almost £108 Billion of it. 

http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/20/budget-2013-tax-spending-visualised#zoomed-picture


The borrowing alone is over 3x the size of the Welsh economy. So, an independent Wales can meet the expenditure with borrowing, like every other country on earth does. 

Though, you also have to look at what the expenditure is used on. As it shows in the links: £4.7 billion is the welsh contribution to the new trident program. As an independent nation, we wouldn't have need of that. Wales also spends £1.9 Billion a year on the UK's military - we wouldn't have to spend any where near that. The Rep. of Ireland has an established military, that more than meets an acceptable quality and only spends 500M euro on it. An independent Wales would only need to spend no more than 300M on it, and we have over 1,000km of relatively untapped power, and with the second highest tidal range in the world, the potential for energy generation is massive, and an economy where 15% of the GDP accounts for manufacturing. This all can be grown and invested in. 

An alternative to the shale could be coal - about a trillion tonns of it is estimated to be underground off of the cost of South Wales. While not very green, there are many green solutions and alternatives to shale and coal aswell. Wales produces the majority of the UK's green energy through wind and tidal power, and with the Welsh population considerably less than England's, at 3.1 million compared to the English population of 53.06 million, Wales should more than be able to cover the power needs of an independent Wales, with any over being sold to England. These areas could be expanded upon and invested in massively.

The issue of the North/South divide is a big one, but that merely requires investment from the Welsh government - something we could solve more efficiently in an independent Wales.

The issue of a large percentage of population in areas of the Wales working in England could be solved easily by an agreement being worked into independence where they are issued with automatic work vissas if they work in England, Scotland or N.Ireland, and the fact that people work for the DVLA isn't a problem - they'll still have their jobs if Wales was to be independant.

Wales could also join a currency union with the rest of the UK - much like Scotland plans to do if the Yes campaign win the referendum - which I think they have a high chance of doing.",0,1409595418,null,0,1409596815,0,ck6ef53,t3_2f6gh2,t1_ck6ef53,t1_ck6db3p,null,1427253396,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1

For companions, you got a look into their lives, and those lives mattered. You met friends and family and lovers, and there was a very real sense that these characters were people who mattered. 

By contrast, Moffatt's Doctors have been gods dressed like men, all powerful wizards roaming around the universe with their magic wand and their blue box. Moffatt's companions have been paper dolls, almost entirely unconnected to the world around them, except when it's convenient as a foil to the Doctor's plans. There's very little emotional resonance in his seasons, and I find myself struggling to connect with the characters in any real way.

It's by far the most salient point that half the self-dubbed economic geniuses in here don't seem to grasp: you can't just charge everyone more and expect it all to be a-OK - you have to provide alternatives. 

Not just cycling, no matter how much that brigade advocate it - because England is not flat and plenty of people need to travel more than is practice on a push-bike and/or have things to carry with them that a bike cannot easily support. 

The answer is not simply 'walk or get a bike' - you need to cater to convenience for all, not just those with the inclination to cycle. 

The answer then must be an investment in public transport *and* green routes so that those displaced from driving have economic alternatives that *are* workable.

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"1. You track your runners as a central midfielder, it's pretty simple really. Seeing as he's not looking along the line to see where is offside and where isn't he's just got to track the run and stop him from getting behind the defence. He clearly doesn't notice the run, irrespective of where the defensive line is, if he doesn't spot someone making a run on his inside he's in big doodoo. Don't act as if the defence is can hold such a high line when backpeddling. When running back into your box to defend attackers like that you don't all run back in a unison line, otherwise Vertonghen wouldn't be the last man back, then Capoue then Kaboul.

Are you saying at [at this point here](http://i.imgur.com/iJ6dY2Y.jpg) that Kaboul should let Vertonghen be the last man back as he procedes to be beaten and a huge hole in the middle opens up where Sterling is making a run into and Balotelli is hanging around. Defenders drop as their wide men are beaten so as to defend the crosses and runs, which Kaboul and Dier ended up not being able to stop. Capoue did the same, he just didn't notice Henderson's run until it was too late.

2.""He watches Sturridge"". No he doesn't his face is looking the other way at Allen who is turning him. Unless he is looking out the corner of his eye whilst his head is turning right I'd say he's not looking at Sturridge.

3. Sandro doesn't need to make up 10-15 yards, if the danger is seen early enough he can stomp it out as Moreno is at an angle and as such has more distance to run to the goal than the players in the centre. When Moreno starts his run he's further from the goal-line than Capoue and is at a wider position.  This is obviously a hypothetical issue, but Capoue has a distance and angle advantage on him, but left him have space to run into so long that Moreno was past him.",0,1409596340,null,0,false,0,ck6esp2,t3_2f63dq,t1_ck6esp2,t1_ck6c52y,null,1427253220,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Your brother's point is true, but it only relates to ""dark moments"". With a dark character we get the benefit of seeing light moments, which is entertaining in its own right. 

I was thinking about something that relates to this recently. Even though the 12th Doctor is advertised as the ""dark Doctor"", he could be described as more moral and honest. 10 and 11 put on acts of being light hearted, but certain moments revealed how manipulative, callous, prideful they can be. 12 comes off as arrogant, but his moral actions and brief ""light moments"" show us his ""true nature"". With 10 and 11 the ""twist"" is that they have a dark side, with 12 the ""twist"" is that he's a good guy at heart. 12 is less likely to break down and do a ""timelord victorious"" stunt because he's not bottling up his darker aspects, he's come to terms with them.

A light character with dark moments makes the viewer suspect the character's ""true"" nature is dark. A dark character with light moments makes the viewer suspect the character's ""true"" nature is good natured.

As to which one's better, both are good in their own right. I think because we've had two light characters, 12's characterization is what is best for right now, because it's fresh and different.

Astute.

I'm not going to bleat, but this has fucked me off in all honesty. We all know what happened the last time we won the title, our rivals strengthened in the summer, and we stood still - a limp title defence and a loss to a relegated side in the FA Cup final followed.

We sack managers, have no ""respect for traditions of the sport"" and we don't have an excellent academy. We have no faith in our youth, our only academy trained player is Terry, we snatch players from other clubs, many of our players had abrasive personalities. Our manager is arrogant, creates a siege mentality and likes to antagonize other rivals. Chelsea is also historically a hooligan club, with firm connections on top of being ""allied"" with Glasgow Rangers in a sort of religious/political way.


However, all these things can be argued as outdated opinion. Or that many of these behaviours were evident with other clubs in the past, we just do it better now. Liverpool, City, United, Arsenal, Aston Villa, QPR, Southampton and Sunderland all have non-UK ownership. Roman has invested millions into making sure the club will be well taken care of after he either dies or sells. The academy has been heavily invested in, with many of our youth prospects earning large profits in transfers. 


I don't care how the players act in their private lives, as long as they remain professional and refrain from activity that may diminish their job quality. The league is competitive not only on the playing field but off. Snatching players is part of the game and football is a very capitalistic business world. Go to the MLS if you want salary caps and player drafts. 

The club has an excellent front office, medical staff, scouts and trainers. Sometimes, it feels many other clubs seem to think backroom staff are not the priority that Chelsea finds auxiliary personnel to be. Our manager is clever, adaptive and ambitious. If he's so wrongfully smug, perhaps the other clubs should focus on knocking us down to the Championship.  

Most people either don't know or don't care about past hooliganism and political support. It's a business and a form of entertainment. I doubt many under a certain age care about religious lines or political preferences.

First half was, to be honest, some of the most majestic and beautiful football i've ever seen, Milan was so on point with everything, and they did exactly what they had to. After the final whistle in the first half, i cried, i was at this point 10-11 years old. I cried, but never did it appeal to me to turn off the tv and go to bed. Between all the crying i did, i didn't feel mad or anything like that, because if Milan were to win because of that half, they damn well deserved it.

Second half starts, and im just sitting alone in my room in the dark, with teary eyes and all. Steve gets the header we all know over the line, and the way he basically carries the entire neutral/liverpool section of fans by the gesture he does after the goal, i had a funny feeling. Odds were against us, but i had a feeling. 

A minute time after, Šmicer hammers it against the goal, i just see Baros standing in the way of the shot, in what i remember to be an offside position, and he goes near Matrix on Milan. He jukes the ball like a fucking dodge ball master, and completely obstructed Didas view of the ball, 3-2... 

Again, a minute or so after that goal, we get a fucking penalty! Xabi steps up. He looks so cool and unaffected, like Xabi fucking always does! My god, he misses, Dida superbly took it, but somehow didn't hold onto it nor did he punch it away, it goes back out for Xabi, and he just hammers it up. Im yelling, my parents were asleep, not anymore, im yelling some more, its like im drunk, cant really control my actions, i just do something.

The rest of the half is just the Dudek show (also thanks to Shev)!

Extra time: 120 minutes played, the best football match i've ever seen. After 2+ hours of game time, Dudek still has energy to fucking jump around on the goalline. They miss the first two, we score. Im so fucking stoked and happy. Jon Dahl Tomasson steps up (as a dane, i kinda wanted him to score AS LONG AS liverpool would win), he scores. Riise steps up, with a decider, misses... Not to worry fucking Shev continues on missing. Šmicer with the winner.

Pretty short commute, combines exercise as well.  Thought it'd be the lack of cycling facilities that put you off.  

It's almost as if we should do something about that.

&gt; There's probably about 2 months a year I could comfortably ride that distance without getting soaked or sweating my tits off. 

&gt;It just doesn't seem like all that attractive an option. If trains were cheaper I could bike to station, get on train, then bike to work via cycle lanes from station. 

I can understand the weather putting people off, personally I'm doing it 12 months of the year.  Wind is the worst, rain and sun is nothing.  It's very simple to deal with that.  More so if more places catered to people cycling.  Chicken and egg again.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"I think it is equally interesting if handled properly. The main stitch of the story is how well the writers handle the grey. There is a difference between doing bad things and being bad and doing good things and being good. Just because someone is capable, does not mean it really has any less weight on their actions, unless their actions make absolutely no sense. Saying that a light person doing dark things is more or less impactful than the converse is actually ignoring all the shades of grey that exist in this universe and the Doctor Who universe.

Everyone seems to forget the Doctor's history. I mean on the surface the newer series seem darker today than the past but if you have seen any classic you know this is not true. If you were to transplant many of the past stories to today and only changed the production quality, they can be just as bleak and dark. 

One of the Doctor's first acts on screen was to nearly brain a wounded caveman to death. Only the intervention of a companion stopped him. The transformation of the First Doctor from a slightly manipulative and curious to the point of recklessness old man to a more warm and considerate man willing to leave his granddaughter behind so she can have a good life on her own is pretty much what has driven the Doctor from the start.

He started out as a true renegade. He stole a TARDIS so he could experience the universe but had neither the skills nor the attention to do so properly. All he had was an inexplicable wanderlust. He had nothing else to define himself. But just as the Twelfth Doctor said when he went to Skaro he learned that the Doctor (who he wanted to be) was not the Daleks. He no longer wanted to just experience, he wanted to stand and defend people against evil.

I think parallels of the Twelfth Doctor with the First will serve to strengthen the narrative. The Doctor wants to be a good man. After all he has done he isn't sure if he is or can be, but he knows he still wants to be. There has always been darkness and light in the Doctor's hearts and he is pretty much capable of it in equal parts. Sometimes more of one side shines on the outside a bit more, but they are always there in equal amounts.

This is what the Doctor is fighting in himself, this is why he doesn't know if he is a good man, this is why he appears darker on the surface. He wants to know if he can accept all of himself, if he can embrace the extremes of his personality to heal himself, to move on, to be the Good Man even when there is darkness in his hearts.",0,1409597146,null,0,false,0,ck6f48r,t3_2f6g1w,t1_ck6f48r,t3_2f6g1w,null,1427253070,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Example 1. Workmate lives 1 mile from work. Walks in and out. Free travel, plus an average of 200 calories burned.

Example 2. My Uncle and Bro both ride motorcycles. Distance to work 15 miles. No calories burned but fuel use is about 20% of the car! Time saver, too as you can ride past the traffic jams.

Example 3. Me. I ride a bicycle. Free travel, about 300 calories burned each way - only 8 miles. I'm not Bradley Wiggins, I'm a slightly chubby 14 stone bloke nearing 40. 

Example 4. My friend at work. Late 40s, rides an electric bicycle. Cost her £700 and she does a total of 4-5 miles on it. 20 mile range capacity on the battery and costs her 20p to recharge during the night.

I think all too often people assume a distance is too far for alternatives without actually checking. Using phone apps (this is how I checked my commute with an app called Strava) you can measure the commute, plus the commute time.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"There is no reason why Wales, even as it is today, couldn't be a viable independent sovereign state.

That said, I don't think the question you ask in the title is the really important one. The question I would ask is ""*Should* Wales be an independent nation?"". My answer would still be yes, but it would be a more tentative yes, with qualifications. 

The point that /u/Fyenwyw raises with regards to Wales' budget deficit is a good one. A critical difference between Wales and Scotland is that Wales is unquestionably a net recipient of funds from central government. Scotland is (barely) a net contributor. Per capita, the tax take in Wales is less than any other constituent part of the UK - a consequence of Wales' relative poverty - and that poses a real problem with independence. On independence day, the Welsh Government would have to be looking at spending cuts, tax rises and a painful amount of borrowing in order to balance the books.

And yet, I still contend that independence, in the long term, would be best for Wales. Why? How we got where we are now. Ed Miliband's ""redistributive union"" - that is, the United Kingdom - has failed Wales. It has failed to secure economic prosperity or social justice. GVA per capita (a crude measure of productivity, but it's all we have) has been declining relative to the UK average since 1987. The reasons behind the decline are many, but part of the picture is absolutely the overly centralised state of which we are a part and its almost total disinterest in Wales. It has endowed us with a lack of investment in infrastructure, a currency which makes exporting difficult and an inflexible tax code that doesn't allow for regional variation to offset economic imbalances. It's relentless focus on promoting the economy of London and the South-east has produced an environment where the median wage in Wales is £11,056 lower than in London, [according to ONS figures](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=Earnings+by+Region#tab-data-tables), leading to an inevitable brain drain which only makes the problem worse. 

Independence presents a real opportunity to turn our ailing fortunes around. I would advocate a more gradual path than the one taken in Scotland, though. Increasing taxation and borrowing powers to the Welsh Government should allow them to tackle the infrastructure problem head on (or it would if the government down the Bay wasn't so fucking useless), so the government's response to the recent Silk Commission is at least partly positive.

He should have read the situation and stepped up. Instead he doesn't and Henderson is kept onside. Capoue played it as he should have. It's pretty simple, Kaboul fucked up.

Capoue received the pass from Dembele initially and spreads it to the opposite side with a pass to Dier. Dier passes and makes a smart run. Remember at this point Spurs are down two and are chasing the game. Capoue makes himself available as an easy safety valve pass centrally. Townsend dwells on the ball and fucks up as does Kaboul. Moreno has 10-15 yards to his advantage as well as already getting up to pace with several strides. No CDM in the world catches up to Moreno at that point. None. Kaboul should have slid over and taken away the immediate threat. It's Vertonghen's, Dembele's and Capoue's responsibility to take away the passes in that situation.

Something I just noticed is how well our transfer comittee did. Ayre' success is only determined on the quality of players who come in. I just did a quick look at the yearly cost of ManU 3 top forwards and it came to 65M a year, smaller than what it would have been had Rooneys 30M transfer not been divided in the years he has been there. Balotellis 5M wages + 4M/year transfer together with Sterling and Sturridges upcoming wage increase would take ours to 9M Balo, 6M Sterling (5M fee divided by 5), 7M Sturridge for a total of 22M a year. Or 2M less than what Falcao costs a season. Now I'm not saying I wouldn't want to have world class players, but this is a comparison of value for money.


It seems everywhere you look in the club there are calm heads going about their business, when in other clubs there are complete mess of management that we suffered from couple of seasons back. 


The people working on the stadium did their part, the transfer committee did theirs, Ayre got the deals done and Brendan is getting the results. It doesn't feel like a club that is about to fall apart like it did couple of seasons ago when manager and owners where fighting, or after that when management were willing to put in money but the transfer strategy was horribly misguided.


While we are calm and looking forward to our next game some clubs are in panic mode having failed to provide the players their manager asked, or their transfer strategy being in weak state. Some have huge lacks in their squad but don't have the funds to fix it. Our team is all finished up with couple of out goings and nearly every player fits into the managers style and system. If BR left next summer we could easily find a manager that could continue the same system rather than forcing a world class manager into forcing RvP/Rooney/Mata into a system and now 2 more players. 


We have harmony in the club that money can't buy and one that took City half a decade to form. United had that stability and harmony held together by Ferguson for decades and we did too after Shankly came up until the 90s. We may not win major trophies in the next 2-3 seasons, but I can't see us not challenging, the quality and understanding is of such quality that it has to produce something even if it isn't trophies. 


The rebuilding Juventus, the rise of Atletico, Dortmund and now Roma all have this feeling to it.

That is true I suppose, they will be moved to England. Some jobs will be lost in the process. But, I think that more jobs will also be created through the process. As there'll surely be the creation of a Welsh DVLA.

&gt;Still the percentage difference in tax expenses and receipts for the UK &gt;is much better than the current situation in Wales.

What I am saying is that it CAN be dealt with through borrowing, and that there CAN be cuts in things that are not in the interest of Wales, like the £4.7 Billion spent on the new Trident program. There'll also be increased investment and growth in sectors that are important to Wales, which will provide more jobs. There are options, and options are what Wales needs.

&gt;The North South divide I feel requires more than just saying &gt;investment as you still have 100 miles of mountains and not much else &gt;between the major population centres in North and South Wales.

There are investments in the rail link between the North and South, as well as the possible expansion of the A487 which runs along the Welsh coast from Milford Haven through to Porthmadog, Llanlyffni, Caernarfon and Bangor. There are options.

I think the two things you mentioned seem to have been factors from what's been reported; but like above, there are other Pakistani communities, where people might share somewhat similar values I guess, but this hasn't happened and it raises questions. I think that as well as what you say there are other issues like; the treatment of 'undesirable' poor kids and ones in care, corruption within the community and generally, something like Victorian 'public/private morality' (in which there are stringent moral standards publicly but also 'clandestine traditions' and people will try to cover up stuff that indicates that this is bullshit) and the ingroup/outgroup relationship and chauvinistic relationships between groups, in Rotherham at least.

It's only a Pakistani muslim problem in the same sense that being an older white male in a relative position of power is a problem.  There may well be problems in each grouping in terms of attitudes towards young (usually female) people.  There may well be generalities made by Pakistani muslim males that are particularly shitty towards young white women.  Are such attitudes unpleasant? Yes. Are they endemic in every pakistani muslim male or older white male? No.  Are such attitudes illegal?  No.

It's those men who go from having a bad attitude to actually committing a crime that's the problem.  To put it another way, there was a study a few years back about how many men would rape a women if they had no chance of being caught.  I remember being *horrified* by the statistic - something like 25-30% said they would (I will find the study at some point).  Here's the thing - men have really shitty attitudes towards women - fuck, you can't even suggest that [objectification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_4dPB9MVS8) is a thing without blokes getting defensive.  Attitudes are a problem..and they may well have a tendency to be worse in Pakistani muslims or older white males, but by focussing on those groups, you deny the greater problem.

These are not easy problems to solve, but for the time being we **do** need to be arresting those people who *actually commit the crimes*.  The guy in the video **is** trying to make progress - he's suggesting that we ignore the bullshit and go and investigate these people.  He's clearly stating that he sees a wider community.  He doesn't see himself or the people around him as culpable in the same way that **you** don't blame yourself.

Yes, there will be arrests of muslim males - the focus is there at the moment.  They'll also be arrests of white males, but they won't come up so much in the media unless it's related to Saville or politicians..this being because it happens very often.  A quickie google suggests that there's **48,000** on the register for England and Wales..and depressingly, that's only since 1997.

Finally, if you complain about voting, you'll likely get downvoted - it's an appeal to emotion, that's rarely convincing.  Consider votes as read-receipts.

Every time I get on the road I remind myself that he is here too, looking for another cyclist to kill.

This is because the motorist is incentivised by societal norms to loathe cyclists. Britain has a horrible attituide towards cyclists and that attitude gets continually reinforced by

* Bad cyclists
* Bad motorists

We need strong leadership to change that. Leadership in this country is weak as it panders to the road lobby.

For about 2 years my routine consisted of scrubbing twice a day with T-Zone tea tree exfoliator. I then changed to a Simple gel cleanser twice daily when I found so much physical exfoliation was really bad, but was still too lazy to start any more of a routine. 

I used the beginner's guide and I've started cheap. Bought Boots foaming cleanser, and their blackhead cleansing lotion as a BHA.

This simple change seems to have made a difference already! I now cleanse with water in the morning, cleanse twice with the foaming cleanser at night to remove makeup, and use the BHA. I leave that for about 30 mins and then put on a Nivea Rich Moisturiser. Although I've started testing Argan oil on my right cheek as I fancy changing from the Nivea. 

My skin is still far from perfect, I seem to have a fair few closed comedones on my forehead, and still get a breakout every day or so, but they're a lot tamer. I believe the cause of my breakouts are hormonal - because I've had problems on that front for years. I'm just starting on Yasmin and hoping that might make a difference too.

This episode was one of the best  episodes we've had since the 11th hour. It was so dark, so creepy, and actually managed to raise some moral questions about the doctor. Capaldi's doctor was amazing. He's stern, dark, and doesn't dance around making decisions. I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the ""shrinking down to go into a creature's body"" trope but apart from some exposition about Dalek biology, it worked really well. Clara was great and has been starting to develop her own character instead of just relying on the ""impossible girl"" gimmick they had in season 7. And the tone of the episode, my god. By far the darkest episode we've had in a long time. I would say since midnight. Apart from using a lot of shadows and dark visuals, the moment where the dalek goes berserk and starts killing everyone was genuinely scary and the fact that they had little to no comic relief was such a great change from a lot of episodes. I'm also really interested in who this ""Missy"" character is and what her whole deal is with dead people. I guess the most likely possobility is that she's a female regeneration of the master but it still doesn't explain how she manages to re-animate dead people(droids?).   
Final judgement: one of the best and darkest episodes we've had in a long time.

I heard about the Valeyard from the GI in ""The Name of the Doctor."" And that name drop alone feels like a bit of a teaser because before then I hadn't even heard of the Valeyard.

It just feels possible to me. For example during Clara's phone call with 11, 11 said something along the lines of ""and however scared you are Clara, the man you are with right now, the man I *hope* you are with...""

Murphy's been on the losing side within Labour for a while - he was David Milliband's campaign manager against Ed, who then promptly demoted him out of Secretary of State for Scotland.

I find it interesting that the only other Labour figure who's making a real name for himself in the context of the referendum (Darling's a given, Brown is MIA, Milliband is even less visible than Cameron) is a Westminster MP who's out of favour at Westminster.

It's interesting to speculate about the likely changes in Scottish Labour after either a Yes or a No vote. Lamont is going either way, a Yes vote means Scottish Labour MPs fighting MSPs for seats, a No vote means someone's going to want to take the credit (over and above Darling, who'll probably be going to the Lords).

If I was feeling a wee bit fed up with Westminster, thought the current leaders of Scottish Labour were complete amateurs, I think I'd be thinking to myself that I could do a lot worse than to get up here and make a bit of noise.

Rochdale (pop 200,000) has 47 bloody children's homes, more than inner city London. Many are in dodgy areas. They are shipping kids in from all over the country, because the homes are privately run, and property is dirt cheap there.

My question is, how can they possible expect the council of such a tiny town to look out for so many vulnerable kids? How can what is probably a very small police force keep them safe?

Isn't there someone higher up in government who should be asking why the fuck Rochdale has 47 children's homes, and how it can possibly be a good idea? That is the person who should be resigning.

Supporting evidence. 

the face of boe tells the doctor that he is not alone. Now this was meant to sorta hint to the doctor about the master. I also thing that the face of boe could have been talking about the existence of the cross-dimensional Gallifrey. 

If the face of boe is Jack Harkness then we know he is a time traveler, and could have been there to witness Gallifrey's shift. All kinds of timy wimey possibilities there.   

Way back in the begging of the revival there was the episode. ""The Doctor's Theme"" in the episode the imprisoned Dalek tells the doctor he would have made a good Dalek.  In the episode ""Into the Dalek"" we find a Dalek telling the doctor that he is a god Dalek.    To me I don't really think that from the begging they had the idea to revamp the time wars, but rather that they are using this theme with Capaldi to head in that direction. 

Capaldi's Doctor is trying to figure out if he is a good ""Man"". The Doctor should have some kind of notion that the time lords are out there somewhere. Is it possible that the Doctor wonders what the time lords would think of his activities since their universal departure? Sorta a what if there.

**Human Resources Management?** NOPE. Too much competition. Unless you were in a top 10 university or have tonnes of work experience and can write mind blowing answers to competency questions, good luck with that.

**Marketing?** Most marketing jobs are mis-advertised, self-employed door-to-door ~~sales jobs~~ pyramid schemes advertised by AppCo Group subsidiaries and similarly borderline criminal companies. Want to work in a crappy job where it may be impossible to even get paid, let alone at the National Minimum Wage of £6.31 an hour? Go ahead. If not... NOPE.

Even legit marketing jobs are too few and far between and generally have the same issue as working in HRM.

**Librarian?** NOPE. Good luck even finding a vacancy.

**Minimum wage call centre job at an insurance firm like LV or DirectLine?** NOPE. Unless you have experience in a sales background, they won't even consider you cut out for their work.

**Retail?** NOPE. Most retailers don't even hire until the holiday season where they need temp workers. Even then these jobs are scarce.

**Recruitment?** NOPE. If they even get a whiff that you've looked into any field other than recruitment, they'll politely tell you to stop bothering them. They only want the kind of passionate graduates whose life-long ambitions have been to work in recruitment. In other words, they want a unicorn!

**Find a minimum wage admin assistant, cleaning or inbound call centre job?** NOPE. Good luck even getting a reply, especially considering how crap 99% of recruitment agencies are in the way they'll either spam your email inbox with dozens of irrelevant, low paid work way too far to commute from or if they're considerate, send you a few automated rejection letters if you do apply for any of their stuff.

**Find a job in a bar or a pub?** What's that, you have a degree and you want to work in our bar? NOPE.

**Take another more useful degree at a British university?** Can you pay tuition fees at an equivalent level to what international students pay? What's that, you can't afford it? NOPE.

**Take another more useful degree at a European university?** Most universities in Europe have more rigorous entry requirements than the average British university, particularly in terms of A Level English and Mathematics qualifications, so... NOPE. Plus, how are you going to fund living in Europe when you can't even find a job in your own country?

**Postgraduate study?** Can you afford a several thousand pound qualification? What's that, you can't? NOPE.

It would also be wrong to claim (you're not guilty of this, but I've had real-world conversations on similar topics) that software engineering/programming/development is stuck, in denial about, or just waiting for an automation revolution.  The software industry has been automating itself for years, and will continue to do so.  After all, all programming languages are computer-aided software development tools; no-one sets the individual bits of memory by hand.  We just get the computer to do the work for us.

The real reason why Artificial Intelligence would be required is that a computer won't know what needs to be written.  This is a human problem.  Bob from Marketing comes over having done a deal with SomeShadyCorp and all it needs is blah, blah, blah.  A computer won't know what this means, it has to be explained to it, hence programming.

There's been a whole raft of products over the years that have claimed to do away with programming, let the end-user construct their own tools, etc.; but these are a sham, they're still programming tools, but with all the sharp-edges removed that make them nigh-on impossible to use for any real-world problem.

However, should a genuine human-level artificial intelligence arrive; then it could quite easily programme itself.  A wider question would be: would it want to?  A genuine reproducible artificial intelligence wouldn't need to programme itself, it could just do what needs to be done.  There wouldn't be much left for humanity at all should this ever happen.

Sorry, that wasn't so clear of me - that's what I go into next - basically the return on investment isn't as good as you think it is if you select your loans yourself.

**EDIT:**

Oh! And I missed this off, meant to talk about it but ended up addressing it partially in a different comment.

The tax is a bit hairier than with Zopa. You can end up owing tax even if you make no money overall, or lose money. In my opinion, losing money or making no money is extremely unlikely. You would be an outlier, but it is a possibility. Much less of a possibility with regular, diversified investments, and much less of a possibility if you choose based on the excellent information they provide you with.

&gt; I guess I want a mix of a good platform for regular small scale investing and a way to learn more about business finances. As well as a way to invest directly with small businesses. So I would be ok with investing the time if it is only a small amount of time each month.

In that case, I would say that Funding Circle sounds perfect for you!

I would definitely say that it helped me understand investment in general better, as well.

It's close enough to the Med to still be warm at that sort of time of the year, whilst not being quite the kind of tourist trap to have every other shop selling cheesy souvenirs- it's still a beautiful old city with nice squares.

The city also has quite a big international student population, which means a lot of those working there have some level of English- like any place you go, though, they will appreciate efforts to speak the lingo if you have any in your arsenal.

The other thing I'd highlight for someone who hasn't travelled much is that Avignon has a [wall all the way around it, with a miniature ring road](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Avignon,+France/@43.9485171,4.8088551,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x12b5eb8739bc9d07:0xe6429b6efa1d7b36), meaning everything is pretty self-contained- if you ever find yourself lost, you can just carry on heading in the same direction, and eventually you'll hit the wall and can follow it round to somewhere more familiar! Made things much easier in the first few days after moving over there.

That's a pretty good phonetic spelling, actually! It's French, which I've found ""looks"" very different from how it sounds, at least in comparison with Spanish.

Allons-y translates as ""Let's go [there]!"" 
Allons is the first person plural (we) conjugation of the verb to go, aller. The ""y"" is a pronoun that means ""there,"" and refers to a place that has already been mentioned. Example:

""Do you want to go to Panera for dinner?""  
""Yes, let's go [there].""

true,nihilcupio,null,null,"Preface - I'm not ""hating"", nor do I have anything against her personally, but I find her advice and ""The Cult of Hirons"" insufferable.

No. Just no. This woman can recommend good products, sure! But she spreads misinformation (you MUST double cleanse, mineral oil is EVIL) but then will randomly backtrack on her statements. Her approach to skincare is not scientific enough for my tastes, one example being she refers to chemical exfoliants as ""acid toners"" but then recommends applying a hydrating toner straight after - which would alter the pH and render ineffective the ""acid toner"". Her beloved Pixi Glow Tonic is actually at the wrong pH to be an effective exfoliant, not to mention that its first ingredient is witchhazel and she calls it astringent, two things she professes to loathe on her Toner 'cheat sheet'. She seems to believe that only expensive products will work. She says to take fish oil for acne despite there being no real studies that prove its efficacy. She thinks that eye cream is necessary despite its being marketing nonsense. She speaks of essential oils being irritating (they can be for many) but then recommends the Caudalie Beauty Elixir, a product composed of essential oils in spray form?? From the ""work"" section on her website:

&gt; Trained in over 100 **brands** and a globally qualified advanced facialist.
Developed bespoke facials and trained teams internationally for top **brands** in the UK, USA and Far East.
Now working as a Consultant to **brands** and retailers in the Beauty Industry.
Advises **brands** on the route into market, where they should be selling and why.    

She is more of a product-pusher than anything else. I'm not sure what an ""advanced facialist is"", but you'd think someone with real qualifications would list them, right? I'm not saying that the majority of her advice is necessarily bad, but her approach is terrible and I would look to her more for ideas than advice.

And the piece de resistance - to avoid acne, she says ""Avoid mineral oils when cleansing. Natural oils are better for the skin. They just are."" NO. Not only is mineral oil as natural as a plant oil (IT COMES FROM THE GROUND) it is NOT comodogenic and NOT the root of all evil. Plant oils are far more likely to irritate.

Another example - she says that you can't use a foaming cleanser because they alkalinise the skin, but then loves the Ceramic Slip cleanser, which is alkaline and contains irritating ingredients like Black Pepper of Frankincense???",0,1409603822,null,0,1409604115,0,ck6hri0,t3_2dfbkm,t1_ck6hri0,t3_2dfbkm,null,1427251837,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3

Example: I live 1.4 miles from the nearest town (Maidenhead).

Cost of return ticket on the hourly bus: £3.60

Cost of fuel: 2.8 miles, 36 mpg, 126.9 ppl: £0.45

Parking for 2 hours: £2


So it literally is cheaper to drive rather than to take the bus, which only runs hourly. 

Also with the same numbers a return drive from Maidenhead to Glasgow costs approx £134 in fuel and the train is £130 return and you have to travel south to London and then back up north with multiple changes. Until public transport is cheaper people are going to drive.

true,GhostofTrundle,null,null,"I think it's clear that we are being set up for a serious character exploration. While the regeneration factor provides some context for viewing the Doctor as a single persona in spite of his various presentations, the show is also emphasizing that the Doctor himself is going through a process of questioning what kind of person he really is — is he a hugger, is he person who fetches coffee, is he a good man. The very question of whether he is a ""good man"" is really impactful in this regard, and Clara's response even more so. 

So Capaldi is tasked with portraying the Doctor as an integrative figure. Even his comments about the color of his kidneys and whether he should wear a scarf really apply themselves towards this endeavor of presenting the Doctor as a single person. And Capaldi is pulling this off quite well, IMO. So I think that, to the extent that the audience is actually very interested in the Doctor, Capaldi will be responsible for a critical portrayal of the character, and the audience will become very invested in his run.

Capaldi as an actor is fantastic. Loved him as the cardinal and Love him here.

However I felt mislead and let down by both the episodes that have aired so far. And since one of the episodes we've seen was just after regeneration in that episode I at least felt there was alot of 11 in there. It was a small glimpse of 12 but still alot of 11. That tends to be the way to transition with new doctors.

So we really only have had one true episode with 12. And like I said. I liked the actor. He's great. The episode was fairly good but It wasn't what I expected. I feel like everything that said this was going to be a darker doctor, while true was over stating what is going to happen. Hopefully I'm wrong.

Don't you think life should be less tough? That the government who you pay your taxes to should be there to help rather than make people's (many of whom have faced a pretty tough life already) choices harder?

I predict an ""austerity"" narrative coming here. But it isn't about tightening the belt for the greater good. Austerity is about self righteous people punishing those poorer than them for their perceived indolence.

Did you read the article? There isn't any social housing anywhere!

All of this becomes even more important when you consider that poor people's wages have risen slower than everyone else's!

true,maggieG42,null,null,"I grew up in a poor family and from that learned many things about saving money.   These I still believe would hold true today.

Number 1 cooking from scratch,  in the long run, saves money.  But you do need to get a few things at the start and this maybe where people are falling down.

You need to buy your spices,  your food containers,  a freezer to store things.  Buy rice, pasta, flour etc in bulk as it is cheaper..   It is this expense which for many of the poor is too expensive.    But once you have that you are on your way.

Also you need to only shop once a week as others have pointed out getting to the shops can be expensive and it has been shown that each time you go to the shop you are likely to buy something you do not need.

So you shop once a week and buy your produce from Aldi or the cheap shop.   You then go home and make your meals.  A tuna bake with lots of vegetables,   a curry,  A bean chilli..  Make all of them and divide them into containers.    I make a fortnights dinner at once for my family.   This also stops you from having the same thing night after night. 

cook one afternoon per fortnight.   

Lunches I have some left over and my child cheese sandwhich,  apple and a biscuit and that is all she needs.

... and I'm not. I said it as interesting. Who on earth would take financial advice from it? Especially when I say it needs taken with a pinch of salt and it's hyperbole.

But aside from that does it matter what anti-semetic bollocks he's spouting?

I posted this as an interesting theory on Scottish house prices. I think there might be something in it because as I said in the post I made in the thread Scottish house prices are performing like northern house prices which may be true for some areas of Scotland but should not be true for others.

As for the spreadsheet you linked that's just the raw Halifax data. Unless you have actually derived the data on his graph from that data I don't know why you're saying it looks wrong.

Even /r/Scotland and /r/unitedkingdom users both agreed that the poles haven't budged that much since the start. And I agree as well.

The so called loss of no  voters and boost of  yes voters comes from last months poll. Were it was 43/57 however if you looked at the survation polls (the more accurate ones) it was still 47/53. The loss and gain of so called votes is just taking into account the more accurate results again.

Yes..yes has been slowly rising but most political analysts don't see it rising enough by September 18th to overcome no. Now if this rise had happened near the start I would put a lot more favour on yes. But im going with No on this. I may be wrong but I don't see the yes movement growing fast enough to take over. 47/53 has been like this for months it was only last month that it was 43/57 which most polling companies agreed was a post debate blip.

Tl dnr version. If yes was growing like this a couple of months ago I would fall that way. But this month won't be enough imo for it to overtake no. I feel no will get a modest victory but not some giant one certain no campaigners seem to be spouting

Also the sudden gaining of votes for the yes movement and loss for the no movement is the post debate polling results going back to the pre debate results aka the more accurate results. Their is no surge to yes although it is very slowly rising.

true,emorrp1,null,null,"I just recently started peer-to-peer lending about three months ago after reading about the top three on MoneySavingExpert. Firstly, I'd suggest doing what I did and just setting up £100 in each of them to try them all out - I was primarily interested in the 5 year bonds for the high rates. Here's my experiences:

**Zopa** is boring, offering 5.2% with Rate Guarantee so they match it even if the money actually went on loan at lower rates. There's nothing to customise other than 3 vs 5 year and reinvestment vs withdrawal. I started withdrawing my capital about a month ago.

**Ratesetter**'s much more interesting in that you're directly competing with other lenders in their market based on rate. You specify a lending rate in 0.1% increments and you get put in a queue at the back of all bids at the same rate, but ahead of all those 0.1% higher than you. Borrowers specify a maximum rate and it matches the cheapest until either the loan is fully matched, or the maximum rate is reached (which you get to see in the market view).

You can time the market since most deposits/repayments rollover to Monday, so the amount on offer, and hence stability, declines over the course of the week. My initial rate was 5.9% before I learnt this, then it peaked at 6.6% when there was only about 100k on market over the weekend, making 6.4% average rate on my £500 when there was average 400k on market. Market rate is currently at 6.0%, with 1100k, partly due to the fallout of that high-rate weekend.

**Funding Circle** is an entirely different class, whereas the others never tell you who the borrowers are, here it's front and center even if you use the automatic bidder, you can review bids while they're still being confirmed. As /u/wowSuchVenice said it's not worth your time to bid manually, but it's definitely interesting to see the details on why people/companies want loans (usually ""debt consolidation"" and ""expansion""). If you're using the autobid system, you set the average offer rate (it'll provide an estimated return after fees and bad debt) and you can customise that for each risk band - they provide statistics on the min/avg/max per band for the last N loans. My estimated return is 6.6% but I haven't had any defaults yet, though FC is definitely the most exposed in that regard.

In all cases it's frustrating waiting the couple of days it takes between the bank transfer and receiving the money in their system. I'd forgotten money transfers used to take this long!

&gt; that excuse wouldn't work at a job

Yes it bloody would. Random, rare medical emergencies are perfectly acceptable - as is lateness due to traffic and god knows how many other shit excuses the Jobcentre use to sanction you.

Your advisor sounds like a hardass, so it's time to beat her at her own game. Phone them tomorrow and ask for confirmation she's received your CV. If you can't get it, email and phone again int he afternoon, or pop in. Make yourself memorable and a nuisance, but in a way that telegraphs that you're going out of your way to comply with what they're asking of you. Ask questions about what help you can get building a better CV, and what they can do to job-match you now they've got it.

Be consistently 20 minutes early for your appointment. if they call you over and complain how early you are, ask them to call you at the proper time and that you weren't intending to disrupt their diary.

Try and do double your allocated jobsearch and ask her for help with self-employment or training every time you turn up.

Forget niceties and fidget and appear busy when she's signing you and jump like a hare when she's done. If it's mentioned, tell them there's a job fair or an informal interview just down the road that you're eager to get to.

Make her regret being arsey to you and you may see her human side eventually.",0,1409606431,null,0,false,0,ck6iutm,t3_2f6i1k,t1_ck6iutm,t3_2f6i1k,null,1427251255,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

No.

Well of course they have you say, but I say no because their bodies have not been given the nutritional components that it needs for repair, growth and sustenance.   Their bodies also know this which is why despite eating a very large amount of nutrient deficient food very soon after the bloating has gone down they are hungry again.   You then give them more and it shuts them up for a bit.  

To feed your body is to give it the nutrients it needs.   Many poor are not feeding their bodies and are doing so at a very expensive price.   

You will find if you eat properly you will eat less.  

Also make sure they are getting enough water.

2) he has England experience. Woy may not be the best manager ever, but nobody is handed 13 England caps for absolutely no reason.

3) he has played for many years in one of the best teams in the world, like it or not.

4) let's face it, the worst of his reputation only came about once he was playing ugly football under the watchful eye of that particulatrly ugly Scot.

Granted, if we spent a ton on him, it might not be the wisest investment considering we do have cover in midfield already. But if we could get him for a cool 4mil, I wouldn't complain, with that level of experience and- yeah, I'm gonna say it- *potential*!

Yes ..yes has increased but still the polling and survation polls point towards it not being able to pass no by September 18th it is simply not rising fast enough. The polling results 47/53  have been like that for months. You are taking in a swerve of no voters to yes over the course of 12 months.

If yes is to win they must convince the over 65s which seems unlikely and the 20s to 30s these two groups are still staunchly pro no. Yes would have to convince the majority of these two groups over to yes in two weeks. Could this happen...sure.....is it possible..of course...do I think it will happen ..no. thats simply it. If the referendum was in 2 more months I would forsee yes rising to the point of them possibly winning. But 2 weeks (although its possible) I see no winning by a modest victory.

If authorities were reluctant to take action against non-white perpetrators or suspects for any reason whatsoever, we would expect non-white individuals to be less—not more—likely to be arrested and prosecuted than white individuals.

That conclusion assumes that people of non-white ethnicity categories commit the same number of crimes, or less, than people of white ethnicity category.

If for example non-whites committed ten times as many crimes as whites, but  were only arrested twice as often, then you could conclude that the criminal justice system was biased in favour of non whites. 

I can't find any statistics on this, and it's quite difficult to measure.

true,DeathHamster1,null,null,"&gt;Taken individually, many of the points they make are good ones, but in trying to say that Moffat has hurt the show as a whole, they seem to forget how many awful moments there were during the Davies era. 

Whataboutery. (Though in fairness, Moffatt is simply continuing the rather shallow and misanthropic approach forged by RTD.)

&gt;Frankly, Moffat is just more creative. 

No, because he's simply repeating himself, RTD and things the show was doing nigh-on 10 years ago.

&gt;Doctor Who is a show about the wonder and terror of time as well the wonder and terror of space. Moffat understands that, using time travel as a tool to explore the horror of old age and loneliness, to examine the redemptive power, not of love, but of memory. That’s a rabbit hole worthy of exploring.

TRANSLATION: He's turned it into a naff soap opera.

&gt;But Moffat’s writing of his companions, flirtatious and prone to sexually-charged banter, seem far less sexist than Davies’ writing of Rose Tyler, the companion who spent much of her time desperately mooning over the doctor. 

More whataboutery. More to the point, Rose at least had dynamism - but it came at the cost of the Doctor's, to the point of it becoming 'The Adventures of Rose - Guest Starring Doctor Who!'

&gt;Moffat is an uneven writer, sure. But Doctor Who has always been a wonderfully uneven show, all the way back in the days of black-and-white monsters with visible zippers.

Which once again tries to excuse the failings of one hack by mentioning the failings of several other hacks. Not to mention that the high points of the old series eclipse much of Nu Who simply because its writers were better and respected their audience more.

&gt;One accusation does seem valid: His major female characters — River Song, Amy Pond, Clara Oswald — all feel cut from the same cloth. Remove the actresses performances from the equation and the writing for them often feels identical.

On the other hand, two of them lezzed up on 'Deep Breath' - which is probably as progressive as you can hope for from Moffat who, as the article admits, is just a fan fic writer promoted waaaaa-aaaaay above his league.",0,1409607337,null,0,false,0,ck6j8ai,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck6j8ai,t3_2f63ki,null,1427251082,-1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-1

We don't really need Gaston at this stage with his track record, a loan is a great move to be honest, not taking to account he could be un-settled again, but if he does well, he can come back to us next season and fight/have earned his spot, if not, can be sold for more money then we would currently get, or re-loan him/put faith in him.

As to where he'd fit, We have Long, Tadic, JWP, Davis, Isgrove, Cork (or Schneiderlin, both can play in the CAM area) and soon JRod is back, not to mention if we get Mane.

Looking at a team of what we currently have, So, Long - JWP - Tadic. At the moment You'll have Davis (if he isn't elsewhere on the pitch) and Isgrove in the pecking order, that's not even taking into account JRod or Mane.

You can still do this, but it's not clear from FD's terms whether you'll qualify for the £100 bonus.

What you probably don't know if you haven't switched current accounts before is that opening up new accounts is dead easy e.g. I opened a TSB *entirely* online, whereas FD required ID documents to be posted. So I suggest opening a new account at your current bank (RBS), then transfer it to First Direct using the CASS to earn the £100, then casually setup your funding (salary) payments within 3 months.

true,Everton_11,crest,Bill's Brown Bomber,"I think he couldn't have been expected to get any of them.  Let's go through this goal by goal:
#1: He's perfectly positioned, relative to where Costa is, between him and the goal, not giving him either post.  I don't know if anyone here keeps, but I do, and trying to get down on a shot like that, from five yards, is effectively impossible.  Perfect finish from Costa, and if jags stays with him, no shot.
#2: His positioning is perfect, again, Jags has stepped up again, to play the trap, unsuccessfully, according to the linesman, so no pressure is applied to Ivanovic who has all the time in the world to pick his spot.  Same situation as the first goal, simply no time to react.
#3: McCarthy is not fast enough to follow Hazard, not his fault, this is an error in the defensive setup.  Hazard drives in, Howard is perfectly placed to cover both posts, Hazard's shot is saved, until Coleman slides in and deflects the ball back across Howard as he is moving to save the shot to the far post.  Nothing can be done.
#4: No pressure is applied to Matic at the top of the box, again, he has all the time in the world to pick out his shot.  Jags and Distin, in their attempt to block the shot, also block Howard's view of the shot, and he is unable to see it, and thus cannot react to save it.
#5: Once again, no pressure is applied until Ramires already has his shot off, a beautiful finish at the far post that Howard can't do anything about, as he must be positioned to guard his near post.  
#6: Besic gives the ball away, the defense has no time to set themselves, Jags slips, and Distin's tackle takes Howard out of the equation, allowing Costa to coolly slot the ball home.  

I attach no blame at all for this defeat to Howard.  It's very similar to Chelsea's 8-0 dismantling of Villa a year and a half ago.  The only Villa player who walked out of the bridge with any self-respect after that game was Brad Guzan.  The tactics were wrong, the offside trap is not going to work against Costa, especially with the quality Chelsea have behind them, and all four defenders had a miserable day.  On the plus side, international break, with time for people to get themselves reorganized, Bobby to study up on West Brom, and most importantly, for the team to get angry at what happened.  It's not going to happen again, and now we've got a point to prove.

So modern things like kitchen appliances have been shoehorned into an old design. Even our bathrooms used to be outside and have been fitted in somewhere. So there was a lack of space to put something like a washing machine.

And also there is the issue of plumbing, this also predates a lot of our houses so the washing machine would have to go where there's plumbing, the bathrooms to small and mainly upstairs, so the kitchen it is.

Most newer larger houses will have a separate laundry room, but because we're a small island, our houses are smaller, so you'll find most houses still have the washing machine in the kitchen.

I have been saying that Salah would most likely to not be Chelsea quality from the day that we signed him. I have nothing against the guy, but my reasoning is based off of performances both at Chelsea and at Basel. His record in the Swiss league was never anything special and when you take away his goals against us he really hasn't been prolific at club level.

I think he will become an alright player, but I don't see him coming anywhere near Hazard, Oscar, Schurrle etc..

If we signed a player like Andros Townsend I would be saying the same exact things. And to be frank, I said the **exact same** things when we signed Victor Moses. But of course both times there were downvotes.

Put it like this, had he not scored against us in the CL would you think he was anywhere near as good before we signed him as people tried to say? If you take away his goals against us you were never left with the quality of a Chelsea player.

Thorgan Hazard, Piazon, Atsu, Traore all seem more promising to me. They all have played in better leagues and played great in as well.",0,1409608201,null,0,false,0,ck6jldn,t3_2f75w6,t1_ck6jldn,t1_ck6io9a,null,1427250912,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

Different companies have different methodologies. They only poll around 1000 people each, so to make that more representative of the 4million+ electorate, they 'weight' the results based on what demographic groups they think are most likely to vote.

This polling company, YouGov, has a methodology that has so far resulted in a higher 'no' vote than any other. That means there's a high chance they've been consistently overestimating how many people will vote No.

As for the 'yes' vote not rising fast enough, let's do some basic math: 7th August - 20% No lead, 1st September - 6% No lead. So 14% shift in 25 days (14/25=0.56 shift per day), with 16 days left (0.56x16=8.96). That'd wipe out the No lead and put the final result at a Yes if that momentum holds. And again, *we're talking about the most no-friendly polling company.*

Not true at all. Farming crops, if done correctly, is *far* better for the environment than any form of livestock farming.

Replacing meat with vegetables is essentially cutting out the middle man.

We've seemingly remedied our CB issues with 1 strong and experienced player in Fazio and one exciting young prospect in Dier.

We've also further increased our defensive strength signing Stambouli who like Capoue is good enough defensively to have played CB and gives us another skillful defensive mid.

Not to forget the Ben Davies transfer which fixes that troublesome LB spot (which also seems to have pushed Danny Rose to perform better) and signed an excellent back up keeper in Vorm.

Personally I think that's a great window. We really struggled in defense last season and I think this window has gone a long way to fixing that, and also provided us with much needed depth.

You are again using a opinion poll (all opinion polls) I might add which still show no getting a tidy majority.  It doesn't matter how much momentum their is because that spurt of growth I highly doubt will happen in two weeks. When the last boost took 2 months.

You technically hypothesing that yes will magically gain momentum to break the over 65 and 20 to 30s within two weeks which again I will say. That the survation polls don't show.  happening.

Keep In mind a boost like this was predicted all the way back last September and even then it still showed no winning.

You have failed to answer when I say that its highly unlikely yes will have that momentum going because right now yes is still rising to slowly.




Again as you say the result is still up for grabs but I am still leaning on no winning. I may be wrong but yes must massively boost up by the end of this week for me seeing it winning.

And even then he still had his moments, for example, i forgot which game it was, but it was the game in which Salah was taking a lot of shots that were saved/or missed, people circlejerked about how bad he was, when in reality he was literally the only person on the team who even came close to scoring, he was by far our best player that game. 

And i disagree about the part when he played against Chelsea, he was pretty known to be an up and coming talent, which he still is. I agree that he's not good enough to start yet, but my comment was in reply to someone who said ""he's a waste of a foreign player slot get rid of him completely"", if we treated every 21 year old like that we wouldn't even have a reserves/under 21 team at all. People forget how young Salah is, and the fact that he's on our subs bench shows he has a lot of potential that Mourinho sees. We have 21 year olds at the club that get hyped up about being ""the future of chelsea"" who have never even played a game for us yet.

b) ""I must have a vehicle to get to work and I'll keep it limping along"", requirement: 4 wheels; price: £300-1500; maintenance: later, hopefully affordable

Regardless, that's beside the point.  I too *understand* it, but I am unhappy about it.  Really, it's the fact that *all three* are gone that bothers me.  Having at least one of them around would make the loss of the other two much more palatable.

No amount of money can fix this problem. The problem is lack of housing. It's a demand based problem.

Councils spending huge sums of money to keep people in London just provides cheap labour for shit employers. 

If councils didn't pay for people to stay in London then shit employers couldn't give people 16 hour contracts with overtime at minimum wage. They'd have to pay more.

Prices would go down for rents as well. Rent prices are driven by house prices and anyone who owns one will charge as much as the market will bear.

Rent limits don't work. More money doesn't work.

The only thing that works is more houses and stopping corporate subsidies in the form of topping people's income up and subsidies accommodation.

Send people out of London to where it's cheaper for them to be housed.

Councils should take an unlimted second charge (the full value of the house once the mortgage lender has their cut) against any BTL property that is to a terrible standard, or any property that after time does not meet a reasonable standard. This will allow them to 'steal' properties from scumbag BTL owners. This will mean that slum landlords will lose lots of properties - or be forced to improve them. And the scumbag part time landlords who want to supplement their income by having a BTL property will lose it all if they can't afford to keep it in a decent standard.

Allow councils to buy brown sites cheaply. If necessary subsidise them to turn it into accommodation.

Everybody apart from me and a select few other people think the problem is money. Everybody else is an idiot.  The more money people have available the higher rents go. 

The ONLY fix is to increase the supply of houses and/or to remove people from demand.",0,1409609491,null,0,false,0,ck6k4l5,t3_2f6ptk,t1_ck6k4l5,t3_2f6ptk,null,1427250663,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Lukaku: need I say more? Record signing, only 21, proven goalscorer in the PL. With Rom leading the line, Champions league football will be coming sooner rather than later.

Barry: incredibly important to the way we play the game, almost never loses possession and very good at winning it back.

Besic: one for the future, the partnership between he and McCarthy in the upcoming years is going to be wonderful.

Galloway: Stones and Brendan will be a world class center back pairing if they can live up to their potential.

Atsu: looks a player and a half, incredible pace and good on the ball, I think he'll be more than decent for us this year.

Eto'o: a once world class player, can still more than pull his weight. He's going to have a great year for us, and the experience and insight he can provide big Rom will be invaluable in the years to come.

A CB would have been nice, but I am not too worried. Jags has had a rough start to the season, but we all know how good our captain is. He's 32, he's hitting his prime as a center half, keep faith in Phil. And I think this is the year stones phases out distin in the regular starting eleven.

Why did Real Madrid back out of signing him and instead sign the thoroughly mediocre Hernandez? Do they know something about Falcao we don't? Is his knee not fully healed? Is he just delaying signing for them for one season? Something to keep an eye on.

Welbeck to Arsenal is just as much of a panic buy. They've needed a striker all winter and leave it til the last day to buy anybody. They deserve to end up with someone as mediocre as Welbeck. What's most amusing is the fee. £16m is a joke. Is he really worth as much as Balotelli? Nope.

City loaning Negredo is a weird one. He was excellent last season, 23 goals in his debut year.

All I am saying is that he isn't a real gem or a someone who deserves to be hyped as much as some people have. From what I have seen from him and from his records at Europe he just simply hasn't shown anything to indicate he will become one of the top wingers.

I really don't rate him any different than I rate Piazon, T. Hazard or Atsu, I acutally think all of those are better. All of the other players have been ripping it up on their loan deals and have barely got a fraction of the attention Salah gets on here. For example,Thorgan Hazard doing better in the Belgian League than Salah did in the Swiss league, which is an inferior league. People on here want to make it seem like he is better than those players only because he is in the first team and the others are not. 

But the truth is Salah was brought in as an unplanned signing to replace De Bruyne. Once De Bruyne left we were a bit thin in attack and needed a body to replace him, we didn't want to recall any of our current players from loan so we got another one for a good price who could potentially make us a profit in the future (part of our new FFP business plan). Him being in the first team was just him being right place right time. 

I think it would be stupid to sell him now, but I would like him to get some type of loan so we can get more to judge him off of and he can show people more of his abilities.

true,vaskemaskine,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Ex-IT contractor here. Forget Umbrellas, they skim a decent amount off the top in commission and you generally don't save much on tax compared to PAYE.

Instead, set up your own LLC (limited liability company) - it's fairly painless and cheap (although you may want to hire an accountant to take care of it for you). You will also need to open a business account with your bank, and take out the necessary insurance policies (Public Liability, Professional Indemnity, etc.).

Once set up, you invoice your ""employer"" (or more frequently, the agency your employer works with) via your company. You invoice for your daily rate plus VAT.

From that, you pay the VAT on to HMRC, then you pay yourself the equivalent of a £10k salary, which is tax free.

The rest you pay yourself in dividends, which is taxed at a flat 20%. This circumvents the need to pay National Insurance, too.

You can also deduct things like travel costs, lunch and equipment/supplies - if you can reasonably prove that they are work-related expenses.

You should also be aware of IR35 - most employers who hire contractors will word their contracts in a way that reasonably falls outside of the legislation, but some won't so you should definitely get your accountant to look over and amend any potential contracts before you sign them.

As an example, if your daily contracting rate is £400, you can expect to take home at least £6.5k a month assuming a standard 5 day week, using the above method.

Additionally, if you have a spouse or partner who is not taking full advantage of their tax-free allowance, you can add them as an employee and pay them a salary up to the allowance limit, thus saving you even more.

I think we're growing further into a culture that has devalued vocational work so much that even entry level jobs are seen as undesirable. Companies don't want the hassle of training people up and expect to be able to take on experts at a whim.

The sad irony of this of course is that experts coming into your company are generally not as effective as experts that have grown there and know it well.

The fourth Doctor was still very young when he went to Skaro in *Genesis of the Daleks*. I would say he was still very idealistic, in his own way. He asked himself ""Have I the right?"" (to commit genocide), and concluded he did not. That much we know. The War Doctor asked the same question, and came up with a very different answer. That we also know. Ten and Eleven came to the same conclusion, and would have seen it through if not for Clara. Ten had the same issue with the Empress of the Racnoss and Donna.

We also saw Nine more than willing to destroy the last of the Daleks in.. um.. *Dalek*. He was aghast at Rose's efforts to protect it.

So I agree. War, Nine, Ten and Eleven would have destroyed the Daleks back on Skaro.

Would Twelve, though? Is he a good man?

Agreed, but that being said, nothing is going to filter out dangerous levels of pollutants when the individual molecules of NOx/SOx/etc are - well - of comparable size to oxygen molecules.

Anything less than industrial clean-room standards won't protect car occupants from poisonous gases - notice how much more severe the cartridge filters are in a gas mask than in even a high-end car air filter. The pollutants will still whiz right through, along with the rest of the air, and accumulate inside the cabin.

Also note that probably most people won't notice or care if you wear a black suit (with dress shirt and bow tie) rather than a dinner jacket and dress trousers to any event where the dress code is formal. That said, as blackrat said, you will almost certainly get your money's worth out of one at May Balls, society annual dinners, and so on.

EDIT: re formalwear: people are more likely to notice that you are wearing a pretied bowtie, I think, than that you are not wearing true dress trousers -- I imagine a good proportion of the students don't know what the difference between formal and informalwear trousers is.

Also, for some small number of events (Magdalene May Ball is the major one), white tie is mandatory.

true,bahamut19,null,null,"Overall, I prefer Moffatt's run, but it's not without its flaws.

Season-long plot arcs were desperately missing from RTD's Doctor Who. Monster of the week with a few bits of scattered foreshadowing for the finale don't constitute a plot. Moffatt brought the plot, but I'm really not sure he knows what the end product will be when he starts laying down the foreshadowing. 

In my opinion what this has led to is a series with RTD with no reason to keep up with the story, but with some epic season finales. This got handed over to Moffatt who writes great stories with excellent moments of intrigue, but even the interesting conclusions are often dissatisfying. The conclusion of The Name of the Doctor was a total mess, and the resolution of the entire plot arc was hand-waved as irrelevant once John Hurt's Doctor was introduced.

My other criticism is with the disconnect between 10 and 11. Despite Moffatt's love for long-running stories he refuses to use any of the secondary characters from RTD's run. I understand why we don't see Donna or Rose, but Captain Jack? Martha?

Speak to accommodation services again and push to see whether they can help you out - try speaking to a manager or someone more senior. There is sometimes emergency accommodation available for cases like yours.  
 
Also, you could try talking to your admissions tutor/head of year/faculty people if you can get a hold of them. They have responsibility for pastoral issues until your personal mentor has been assigned (which is usually mid-freshers week).

It also works the opposite way of course - when rates jumped because of lack of liquidity in the weekend market, they then stayed high (6.7% for the Monday reinvestments) allowing me to take advantage of under-bidding (6.6%) to still get an awesome rate. The total amount on market just kept growing over the next few Mondays (due to all the unmatched queues) while the weekend rates slowly dropped.

true,f1v3-4c3s,null,null,"The following are potentially stupid but possible things an Evil Boss could do:

* Banning personal or shared music in the office.  Many offices are music free.  Usually for phone call purposes.
* Asking the team to stagger lunches to provide cover for receiving incoming phone calls.
* Ask the team to give sufficient notice for holidays to allow them to plan around them.  (see more below)

I am a bit confused by the structure of the paper's team of 6~8 people.  There is an Evil Boss with two Minions.  Then is there a Good Boss with two to four Minions?  Is there no one in charge of Evil Boss, lets call them Absent Owner?

I'm also wondering how many hours a week you are paid to work compared to how many you are working?  If you are getting a salary and putting in plenty of unpaid overtime then you should be in a good position to complain.  If you do the bare minimum then you will be in a weaker position.

You said Evil Boss makes you work early/late to cover holidays?  Does that mean you are working flat out all the time?  Or are you expected to be in the office lots of hours even though a lot of them are unproductive?

Overall it sounds like an unhappy place to work.  I would consider writing down the issues you have with Evil Boss to share with Absent Owner.  The reason you want to write them down and re-draft them is you don't want to sound confrontational or aggrieved, you just want to sound like you want to work with Evil Boss to make everyone's working day more efficient and productive.  However, this may not achieve anything or it may make things worse no matter how well worded.

One of my first jobs out of university was with a shady company that only hired young people.  Their business model was to overwork us so they didn't have to hire enough people and because we didn't know any better we went along.

Holidays and Working

This is always a tricky one.  If I take a week off, one of two things can happen.

1. All the work I am normally asked to do that week gets left and I have to do more work than normal for a few weeks when I get back.

2. A colleague does my work when I'm off and their work, so has to work harder than normal.  But, I then do the same for them when they are off.

The situation in 1 tends to happen when everyone in the office is working flat out (or when you just have lazy colleagues who don't like you).  Think about it, if you and everyone else in the office are working more than your normal hours every week, then there is zero slack to take up your work when you are not there.

I'm sure my office is not unique in that we have been understaffed since 2008 and management have no plans to get back to a reasonable staff level now that they know how much free work they can get out of us.",0,1409613228,null,0,false,0,ck6ls0i,t3_2f79xm,t1_ck6ls0i,t3_2f79xm,null,1427249893,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

You said Sainbury's so we'll go with that. They have [161,000 employees and make a net income of £798million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainsbury's). If you increase minimum wage a mind boggling *30%*  then the new minimum wage will be £8.203. That sounds like a lot. So if you pay 100,000 of the employees (well over half) this increase in pay, how much will it cost them? 

Well it's a pay increase of £1.893 per hour. £75.72 per week (40 hours) and if they work every week of the year £3937.44 per year. 

For 100000 employees that is £393,744,000 a year. Leaving Sainsbury's with a paltry £404,256,000 net income. But actually this is a low estimate of their net income because they will pay less tax because of lower profits due to higher staff costs.

This is assuming people work 40 hour weeks every week of the year, which, on average, they do not.

Huge businesses most certainly *can* afford to pay their employees more, whilst still making very generous profits. 

Of course this is one example and may not be indicative of any general trend, but we really must examine how much profit businesses are making. This example is a very large business and smaller businesses cannot really be compared. Too many people come to conclusions and make decisions based on unfounded ideas. I wonder how many people in Westminster have done this simple maths for even a single business. We must look at the actual profits and costs of many businesses and discuss what is an acceptable profit to be making when the lowest employees are struggling to get by.

true,lepusfelix,null,null,"The point is that increasing automation is going to cost jobs. That's not rocket science, or a myth, it's reality. It won't cost every single job, immediately. Instead it'll take a significant percentage gradually, over decades. ASDA is a prime example of the beginning. Where once there were rows of checkout manned by people, there are now maybe 2 or 3 of those, and an array of self-service ones.

Technology that's in its infancy is showing a bleak future for drivers. Automated cars that drive themselves. Why the hell would you pay for a black cab if there's a cab company running a fleet of cars that don't have drivers to pay wages to?

Thing is, all of this is progress. Fight progress all you like, but you'll be worse off for doing so than not doing so. I say we should embrace progress wherever we find it. Just because our entire system as it is relies on people doing work and getting paid for it, doesn't mean that it should be so. Automate what we can, when we can, and if there's a massive loss of jobs and a load of anger about that, then there's going to need to be a rethink of how the system works.

tl;dr: it's not technology's fault if livelihoods are threatened by automation. That's just a gaping flaw in the way things run, and that flaw needs to be addressed.

History teaches tons of useful stuff. It's not career-specific skills, but on the other hand it teaches a wider range of skills than almost any other subject. It teaches you to assess information, analyse it, summarise it and use it to make decisions. That's 99% of most management jobs right there. It makes you a better writer than almost any other degree and teaches you to put your view across in a clear way which is clear, succinct and convincing in writing and in speech. It teaches you to put your head down and work hard--degrees are undeniably easier than in the past, but you still can't get a 2:1 without putting in some hard graft. It teaches you to consider other viewpoints and all sources of information rather than blindly relying on rigid rules as are drummed into students in other subjects, so you become supremely adaptable.

This explains and contributes to a number of social pathologies, including but not limited to:

* Clannishness and associated high levels of corruption.
* A lowered average IQ, leading to poorer educational performance, worse job prospects, unemployment, and higher welfare dependency.
* The insistence on keeping women out of the public space.
* The prevalence of grooming of lower-class outsider girls, since there is a severe shortage of their own women for Muslim males.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"I wish we would have signed a new wide left attacker, someone who offered a skillset our other players didn't offer. However, it seems Poch has identified his man for the position in Rodriguez and is willing to wait to get him. Can't say I disagree with that, and I have to admit I respect him choosing to wait rather than panicking and trying to make another option work. That says to me that he's not only confident in our other options, but the club also confident in him making it work. 

Other than that, I'm very pleased with our signings. We've addressed grave needs in CB and CM, as well as improved in other areas such as giving Rose strong competition and a decent backup keeper. 

I know some are disappointed on not getting Schneiderlin, but don't underestimate the impact of this Stambouli. He is coming in with extremely high ratings in France, and seems to offer abilities we were badly lacking in central midfield, namely energy, mobility, and grit. We have far too many languid, lethargic, ""solid"" players in midfield, and not enough dynamic threat in transition. It seems this guy can offer that along with strong tackling ability. Very much looking forward to seeing what this guy can do, and I hope people will remain open to him and not see him as a ""Schneiderlin fallback.""",0,1409617194,null,0,false,0,ck6nlfr,t3_2f7n8w,t1_ck6nlfr,t3_2f7n8w,null,1427249045,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12
