What you seem to forget is a Bundesliga title. And a small matter of a CL final.

&gt; If you thought this season was gonna be all rosy I'm afraid you're the one with tinted glasses,

Can you please point to any posts of mine saying this? I am on record here saying all we expect is fight and determination, not spreading and bending over and taking it from the likes of Villa and Basel.

&gt; the ones who had realistic expectations are disappointed of course 

Wins against Villa, Sunderland, Crystal Palace, Basel etc. are unrealistic? Ah Ok I see. I didnt know that's unrealistic. I'll get my championship crest ready, then.

&gt; but not to the point of asking for the head of a manager that took us from 8th to 2nd and had us playing the best football 

But also a manager who has totally lost the tactics, confidence and fight that Liverpool FC had under some of the previous manager. Also a manager who has dampened expectations to new low levels (""Folklore"") A manager who freezes out players for no apparent reason. Rafa froze out Xabi and everyone still loses their mind, but BR does it? Ah no worries, BR is a football genius.

&gt;if you think you need to go to hospital, do it, if you're not sure, dial 111 or go to your gp

That's good advice and I have done that - the first time I was told to book an appointment in 8 weeks time - so I went to A&amp;E and ended up having a quintuplet hart bypass as I was having a heart attack but the old bat on the GP reception phone decided I wasn't and could wait.   The second time more recently I had had a minor stroke and it took a total of nearly 4 months to get a diagnosis when A&amp;E would have done it in 4 to 8 hours (and just may have resulted in less permanent damage)  This was after following 111 / NHS advice on headaches. 

What if your the GP service is failing?  What if you don't get through the telephone triage system when you are genuinely ill?  What if your county has a failed 111 system and only 1 out of hours doctor covering 500,000 people?  What if your 111 service just has a recorded message saying that if its an emergency, go to A&amp;E.  I'm not a medical professional so I don't know what a medical emergency is.

I agree that you can't expect A&amp;E to take up the slack if there aren't any valid alternative routes into the medical system, but I can sight a load of anecdotal cases excluding my own where the GP / 111 system failed in the last 5 years and A&amp;E was the only option left for medical care.

Maybe what's needed is a harsher triage system at A&amp;E that can book an appointment with the GP service and send people away?  I'm OK with waiting 4 hours to be assessed because if I keel over in A&amp;E, at least I'm in the right place. Maybe by deflecting the minor cases back to the GP service, the surgeries will get more funding to employ more doctors?

We lost to Villa and drew with Palace last year, Sunderland beat almost everyone in the top 6. Games we should win, yes absolutely. But losing them doesn't mean you sack the manager.

It's probably more common to start drinking with friends here around the age of 16ish in the UK (at least it was with my friends at the time) so there's a big culture gap in that regard. My friend met some Americans in Germany this summer that were about 20 and they went completely mental because it was the first time they could drink legally.

There're things American kids do and are allowed to do that just seem bizarre over here (and obviously to some Americans too). The whole pageants thing is creepy as hell.

false,PooDiePie,,Time for Tim's Tactics,"An Australian player Brendon Santalab allegedly called Iraqi international Ali Abbas a ""fucking Arab, Muslim cunt"" and ""filthy refugee"". These claims were backed up by other players on the field. Santalab denied the charges in similar fashion to Tonev, suggesting it was misheard.

The tribunal ended up dismissing the case almost immediately, suggesting that Ali misheard what was said due to high noise levels in the crowd and the fact that English isn't his first language. A whole lot of bollocks if you ask me, but I guess it can't be proven. 

It's good to see that the Scottish FA are more willing to do the hard work to deal with racism than our FFA, rather than letting players off who had obviously said something wrong, even if there is no definitive proof. They are at least making an attempt to make more of a point, rather than the FFA who tried to sweep it under the carpet.

Pensions can be a cost-effective way to save for the long-term, regardless of employer matching.

We have a [comparison of pensions and ISAs in our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment#wiki_step_4.3A_additional_savings_for_the_long-term_in_a_stocks_.26_shares_nisa_or_a_pension.) which may be useful.

Whilst putting off making higher contributions wouldn't be the worst decision ever,be mindful of the [power of compounding](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/04/02/the-extraordinary-power-of-compound-interest/). If pensions don't float your boat, it is still sensible to make regular long-term savings in some vehicle or other (ISAs being the obvious alternative).

People choose pensions because they can't access the money until they'll need it (e.g. 55+, not state retirement age), and so ""urgent"" purchases that don't seem so necessary in retrospect won't be as tempting.

I joined a pension at 20 that paid 8% and matched the rest up to 16% (e.g. pay 4% and receive 16%). I think I actually contributed 8% (total contributions 20%) and not too many years later it has grown into a pretty reasonable pot of money.

&gt;This is not a standard arrangement used in current traffic signal practices and it is difficult to see a reason why it was set up like this when it was first installed 11 years ago (current practice is to stay on green to the traffic when there are no demands present).
 
&gt;There are plans for some minor works here to alter the nearby bus gate, so when these works are carried out in the new year I will look to make this change at the same in order to carry out the work efficiently and to reduce the associated costs.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (they were measured once in Apr-Jun 2014 at 2% of employment or 1.0% of full time and 4.9% of part time), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Items highlighted with * have more recent data available, so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

Second, if previous booms, such as .com boom, are any indications this means a slow down of investment, not a complete stop. And they cannot capitalize on that slow down because a heavy increase in price will see a corresponding heavy increase in investment in fracking.

Overall thank you for giving a solid reason for this thinking, but I am not sure this price manipulation achieves what people says it does, because the net loss from this dip cannot match the net gain as it recovers without stimulating investment again, unless high frequency instability in oil prices are maintained.

The US government, exactly for those reasons. Subsidies, tax breaks and development grants for all.

All change on Sunday. No Mignolet, no strikers, a back three. Sterling as false-nine, three mids (who are all more comfortable centrally) and Moreno across the middle. A retort, as in Madrid, to those who criticise the manager’s inflexibility. Even with the shuffle, the first ten minutes were reminiscent of us at our best. Energetic high-pressing, purposeful passing and movement. Recently we had become overcooked and frustrating, this was nice to see.

On 12 minutes came the decisive moment: 

* [Sterling spurned his chance](http://gfycat.com/NastyDesertedBeardedcollie)
* [Rooney didn’t](http://gfycat.com/ExaltedWastefulArmyant) 

After that, United stopped doubting, started playing. However we still had openings throughout the game. Balotelli was inventive, productive, the best I’ve seen him in red. Markovic is now making an impact. The post-match thread on here was notably positive for a 3-0 loss, praising our creativity. We aren’t that far off enjoying our football again, but we must take the chances.

Defensive organisation needs attention. It has been Rodgers’ blindspot for some time. On Sunday, Jamie Carragher spoke about how Rodgers was mostly concerned with going forward in the daily training sessions he experienced in 2012-13. The defence, he said, got overlooked. It’s a larger problem than personnel. We are led by a devoutly attack-minded coach.

Results and opinions have nosedived since the summer. Just look back at [a transfer deadline-day thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2f3mbw/a_successful_window_seems_to_me_that_whilst_other/). The summer business had us excited. Our signings are good players seriously under-performing, last season, we over-performed. Our true position is probably somewhere in between.

A short-term fix would be to change the manager. De Boer, Benitez, etc. would mean more transfers, change of backroom, another about-face. They would bring their own blind-spots too. If we only give Rodgers half a season of poor results then how much time would we give a new coach when he hits a rough patch?

The recent talk of the transfer committee is a smokescreen in this, although there is some comfort in imagining what might have been. It's interesting to wonder where the story has come from, shifting responsibility hints at a disconnect and pretty worrying problems under the surface.

EDIT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis

&gt; Cannabis contains more than 460 compounds; at least 80 of these are cannabinoids – chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain.

&gt; The most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC). Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.

Ahahahaha....hahahahaha....haha......ha...... In short: no. There's not. There is a bonus available to us, but that is dependent on the feedback we get from customers. We have this thing called GES (Guest Experience Survey) which I spend all day telling people about because it nets them 20% off their next order if they do it. If above 65% of the feedback in a certain period is positive we get an extra tenner, shift runner £15. 75% all team members get £15, shift runners £20, and 85% team members get £20 and shift managers I think £30. Don't quote me on the percentages of positive feedback we need though. I've seen it happen once, but didn't get it because I was still in my probation period. Wound me up because I was the one doing most of the customer service &amp; getting people to do the damn thing.

BT doesn't really do FTTP in urban areas, let alone rural ones. Virgin has no immediate need for FTTP because DOCSIS does what they need it to do. Gigaclear thinks that yes, it is possible. (and companies like Hyperoptic and Cityfibre are gearing up in more urban areas)

I'd actually believe BT a bit more if they weren't embarking on a totally random FTTP rollout, like they are down here - I've seen back of beyond, rural farmhouses have FTTP, streets where one half is FTTP and the other FTTC, villages where one road is FTTP and the rest FTTC. Oh, and if they weren't pleading poverty while spending billions elsewhere

&gt; These local FTTP projects only work because of community investment, they wouldn't be profitable without it.

As opposed to the taxpayer funding that BT gets for their rollout?

I'd rather pay £500 to a local firm who would give me 1Gbps FTTP than have BT take some of my taxes for dead-end VDSL2 and demands for more money when they've sweated the assets for long enough

&gt; Take Google Fibre in America for example. They have stated that their business so far would not have been profitable without local government subsidies.

Totally different situation to us, not a comparable example (one big difference is that BT has ducts, poles, and buildings to build a network from, Google does not) - and I have never actually heard them say what you are claiming - source?

Buying a car with a tidy bodyshell &amp; interior for £600 then having a new motor fitted is viewed as a sensible route to ownership these days.

Dale's went bang about a week after I bought mine - you just have to accept that no matter how much you baby it, it still might weld itself to itself at any time. Dale's comments about the hit up the back it had being transmitted along the exhaust to the engine and doing some damage might well have been true, the exhaust is one long straight stainless steel pipe that would transmit a shock like that all too well.

Except in those random places I've pointed out, such as the rural farmhouse miles away from the exchange and is the only property for miles, where FTTP installation costs would be astronomical and somehow they did it. Or the companies like Gigaclear who have done it.

Or those streets where apparently one half of it is profitable for FTTP, but not houses metres away from them

&gt; You know some sums of money are bigger than others, right?

Is this a really bad attempt at being patronising? The point is that Gigaclear will deliver a much more technologically advanced network for the money than the multi-billion pound incumbent.

&gt; Let me just restate my position: BT is doing FTTC because it is so much more affordable than FTTP.

Yes, it's cheaper for them and increases their profits, while being obsolete when they started to roll it out, has no real upgrade path, doesn't remove the postcode lottery, and basically doesn't solve the problem.

BT is more than capable, financially and technically, to do much more FTTP than it does - the BS and bluster from them and from you won't change that.

And this totally ignores the benefits like being able to dump the copper network and possibly even reclaim the copper to offset any cost

&gt; Let's focus on getting 95% of people on FTTC, which is capable of great speeds, before FTTP.

Great speeds? Less than 100Mbps if you live next to the cabinet, likely to be much less, will decrease further as customers sign up and create crosstalk, and people on longer lines will barely get more speed than they get on ADSL. No serious upgrade plan other than just going for FTTP, which totally obsoletes the FTTC investment.

Virgin already offers double on their ancient HFC network and might be able to do more if DOCSIS 3.1 becomes a reality. Meanwhile BT's network is working flat out, struggling to do 80Mbps to a meaningful number of people.

But don't worry, if you win the BT lottery and they deployed FTTP instead, you can get 330Mbps today at a reasonable price.

It's an important point that women are still seen as the primary care giver, which ties into why a lot of women go for jobs that are more flexible. As it's simply easier to fit a family into. Not only that, but if a woman quits her career (from any field) to raise children from let's say ages 0-10. She will have missed a decade of experience at work, a decade of training, a decade of adapting to changes in the workplace. Why employ an older woman who hasn't worked in 10 years when you could employ someone with the relevant experience? So, if women after raising a family (for however long) successfully do jump back into work they often have to start at the bottom of the ladder or at least some rungs down.

If a man and a woman leave university with the same degree, and the same experience, but the woman leaves work to raise a child for a few years, the man in the mean time would have risen through their particular field, when she returns she has to either drop a couple of rungs in the employment ladder, but certainly she doesn't jump into a position higher than the one when she left to raise a child.

1. Barton is a character. I quite like the guy. I've repeated myself a lot in saying that I think he is probably on twice the salary his talent level deserves, but he will put his body on the line for the squad. That counts for a lot. I'd rather he hung back in matches though, as I don't think he represents any great attacking threat.

2. Austin would probably command the highest transfer fee and is crucial to winning games. Beyond him, I'd always look to include Vargas, Fer and Caulker in the squad.

3. I've been hoping he'd come good since he signed almost two years ago now. It took for-fucking-ever to get his chance, but I'm glad that he became pretty much the undisputed first choice LB as soon as he put in decent displays at this level. His last game was a bit dodgy, but if he was flawless he probably wouldn't be at QPR.

4. You'll find serious differences in opinion on Redknapp. I won't lie, I dislike the guy. He has a long rap sheet of transgressions in my book, both within and without QPR. It is what it is though, and he is the man at the wheel.

5. I'll second [Loft For Words](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/), which I think is hands down the best fan produced content. The previews, match reports, opposition profiles etc are fantastic, and the forum is one of the most active as well. [Independent R's](http://www.indyrs.co.uk/) and [QPR Report](http://qprreport.blogspot.co.uk/) both put out quiet a lot of stuff. I begrudge QPR Report for holding the @QPR Twitter handle hostage though.

In terms of media, with QPR it's always best to stick to the hyper local outlets - [West London Sport](http://www.westlondonsport.com/category/qpr) and [Get West London](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-rangers-fc). I think the best QPR journos on Twitter are [David McIntyre](https://twitter.com/davidmcintyre76), [Rob Brennan](https://twitter.com/RobBrennan82), [Paul Warburton](https://twitter.com/PaulWsport), [Paul Bishop](https://twitter.com/sportsedbish) and [Jordan Foster](https://twitter.com/JordanJFoster) (although young Mr. Foster was very down on Yun Suk-young, happily proven wrong).

Growing up in the 80s for example it was prayer in school four times a day, mass, visits from priests to check up on your parents, any news item had to get the churches view, mass censorship, church controlled hospitals and schools, prisons for women and children who were seen as different. I don't think I can over emphasise how much it dominated life without comparing it to being behind the iron curtain, and talking with several friends from eastern europe the comparison is not unfounded.

All that changed in the 90s when we saw a total collapse in the churches power.

Even if the pope disapproved of any of those methods, a great deal of the bishops in Ireland opposed the 'liberalness' of vatican II (John Charles McQuaid being the biggest example) and would run their dioceese as fiefdoms with little oversite from rome. This was how they were able to move around abusers so much.

In addition, what differentiates the likes of Spain and Italy from Ireland is the postcolonial mindset (don't worry I'm not going to blame Britain for what went on) where post colonial countries tend to retreat into a basic identity. In ireland, because catholicism was so long an identifying marker for 'irishness' it came to define the state. coupled with nearly all of the progressive leaders killed in the war of independence and civil war it left only the mad catholic right. World war two provided more opportunity to consolidate power and by the time that was finished state, media, schools and hospitals were all in the control of the church

This bit stands out to me:

&gt;Instead, there's yet another trend behind the wage gap. It could be that not enough women are taking ""male"" jobs—things like construction, computer programming, and civil engineering (none of which require anything particularly manly to succeed). Women, meanwhile, tend to disproportionately become kindergarten teachers and registered nurses. This chart from IWPR shows how pronounced this division can be:
IWPR

&gt;The problem? The male jobs pay more—way more. The median annual wage for computer programmers was $74,280 in 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it was $53,400 for kindergarten teachers.

Read the rest of the article though, particularly the bits past that. The problem seems to be (as others in this thread suggested) that women go into jobs that simply *pay less* than the jobs men go in to. Whether that's because these jobs are *seen* as women's jobs and thus valued less, or if there's a non-gender related reason I don't know.

false,Rippsy,null,null,"&gt;Feminism - She calls herself a equity feminist. That is, a person, entitled to equality of opportunity.
A lot of ""mainstream"" feminists are gender feminists, who think just about anything can be viewed as sexist and a tool of an amorphic patriarchy that seeks to suppress women. This can only be tackled by enacting special status for women, they feel entitled to equality of outcome.
For example, a strength test in order to assess whether or not you can carry vital equipment. Drag the equipment as far as you can, a man and a woman are tested. The man can drag the equipment 100m before stopping. The woman drags the equipment 80m before stopping. The test was for 95m.
The man passes, the woman fails.
The equity feminist acknowledge that the genders are different, yet equal, and they both had the same opportunity for the position, and that the woman was not qualified based on the merit of the human being.
The gender feminist will claim that the test was designed to keep women from getting the position and that the test should be either reduced, reduced only for women, or the women be given some sort of aid, like wheels. This is to compensate for the idea that the system is intentionally putting up barriers to maintain male superiority, and therefore needs to be adjusted for things to be ""just"".
Women are then assessed on the same test to qualify for 80, meaning they are passed more often and the representation of genders in that position are closer to 50:50. Ensuring equality of outcome with no regard for practical merit.
When a feminist describes it as ""equality for women"" you need to figure out where the equality happens. Many non-feminists, humanists, egalitarians, decent human beings, do want equality for women when it comes to opportunity. The more radical gender feminists seek equality of outcome. But if you critique the latter you will be labelled and seen as attacking the former.

However that wouldn't be the case for a pension, although the precise amount of tax you'll pay is hard to predict since it depends on the rate you withdraw. If you saw 4% growth in the pension and had a mortgage of 4%, then you'd be ahead if you put the money in the pension.

For some figures:

£80 a month for 30 years with a growth rate of 4% is 55,524
£85 a month for 30 years with a growth rate of 3.66% is 55,547
£100 a month for 30 years with a growth rate of 2.72% is 55,559

Assuming you take 25% tax free and pay 20% tax on everything over that (an overestimate, if I understand correctly) then we'd see the £85 equivalent figure. 

So overpaying your 4% mortgage may be equivalent to a 5% gross savings account or 3.66% growth in your pension (money-wise, not security-wise).

For interested readers at home, an employer match is very valuable. Assuming your employer matches your payments 1:1 then you'd have £170 a month:

£170 a month for 30 years with a growth rate of 0% is £61,200

That means that with an employer match, even a pension that just held cash would be better than paying early on your mortgage.

Assuming you get 4% growth, it'd get you £117,988. For that to be beaten by overpaying your mortgage, you'd need about an 8% mortgage.

As the world gets hotter their electric consumption is going to continue to rise and they need more and more desalination as their aquifers dry up. 

They're following the same curve as the UK did. By 2030 there will be very little oil available on the world markets as internal consumption will exceed exports in virtually all the major exporting countries. No amount of fracking/extreme oil will change that.

And you claim to have studied politics? You're planning to vote for a party that will destroy this country's economy even further by carrying on with vicious cuts to employment legislation, welfare, the NHS, and not to mention crippling British industry by leaving the EU. They plan on carrying on giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy, and plan to carry on with the same dangerous neoliberal economic fallacies that have time and again been shown to be unworkable.

Immigration is a big issue to you? Why? Because the newspapers say it should be? Because your mates down the pub think Britain's 'full up'? How do you justify a statement like that when the figures show that immigration causes a net benefit to the UK to the tune of billions of pounds a year? Not only that, but making an issue of immigration, and untrue and massively distorted newspaper stories about immigrants stirs up ugly xenophobia in people that makes me ashamed to be British. How do you in all good conscience support a party that takes that line?

I have learned much from closely following politics for 25 years, and one thing I've learned is that I'd rather have the economy in a safe pair of hands (which has traditionally been Labour for the last 30 years) regardless of the hypocrisy and bullshit that I might not like about the current organisation if it. Voting for UKIP because you don't like the other parties is like putting a gun to your face because you don't like a spot.

Greens? Actually, yeah. I support them. I won't vote for them because I actually want a solid government in power. But taxing the richest (who will hardly go hungry as a result) to create the biggest welfare state we've seen? Yeah, I'm behind that. Why, you splutter with outrage? because historically, economies are never stronger than when the rich are heavily taxed and the poor have more money to spend. Contrary to the neoliberal bullshit which is nothing more than justification for greed, economies *don't* live and breathe off the wealthiest in society. They are *not* wealth creators. They are *not* job creators. They are sponges. They take money out of circulation and put it in offshore investments and accounts. Money is the blood of an economy, and you don't cure a sick person by bleeding them to death. Economies boom when poor people have more money to spend, because unlike a rich person, *they will spend it all*. You give one millionaire a £100,000 tax break and it won't change their spending pattern at all, because they already have enough money to buy what they want whenever they want it. Spread that £100,000 across 100o poor people and every drop will go back into the economy, making shops busier, so they employ more staff, who then go out and spend more, which makes shops even busier, which promotes expansion.

The biggest lie pulled over our eyes in the last 40 years has been the insanely egotistical notion that the fate of the economy lies not with millions of people spending money, but with a handful of obscenely wealthy people and corporations. So yes, I hugely support the Greens and the left wing ideal of cutting the wealthy down and raising up the people to make an economy strong. It's basic economics.

EDIT:

&gt; 2010 - Liquid nitrogen ingestion followed by gastric perforation.

&gt; Ingestion of liquid nitrogen is rare but carries catastrophic complications related to barotrauma to the gastrointestinal tract. We describe a case of ingestion of liquid nitrogen followed by gastric perforation and respiratory insufficiency and discuss the mechanism of injury and management of this condition. Liquid nitrogen is widely available and is frequently used in classroom settings, in gastronomy, and for recreational purposes.

I think this gives us speed on the wings (Lennon, Rose). It lets Lamela and Soldado play off each other directly. It's a solid back line. Gives us Chadli to put home a wonder-goal through three inches of space.

It is exactly what I said. Men are prepared to take greater risks in negotiating salary *because* they face different societal pressures than women.

What the story doesn't tell us though is that this includes commission based pay too.

Lol, the US is literally the biggest oil producer in the world. 

[According to this the US does, or maybe doesn't. Or something.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_and_diesel_usage_and_pricing#Countries_with_subsidised_gasoline)

&gt;The oil industry receives subsides through the United States tax code, which include Percentage Depletion Allowance, Domestic Manufacturing Tax Deduction, the Foreign Tax Credit and Expensing Intangible Drilling Costs. It is estimated that these tax deductions are worth $4 billion annually and are currently being debated by the government for reform. Although such subsidies exist, the sale of fuel is also taxed at rates that generally exceed the sales tax rates for other goods. It is thus unclear whether the tax impact on fuel is a net subsidy or not.

The cuts are needed to tackle our debt, I don't support cuts on the basis of economic sunshine and happiness but out of a need to deal with our crippling debt levels. We cannot continue to overspend year after year and lump our children with the burden. I find myself shocked by those who actually want to raise spending in a misguided attempt to achieve growth. You do not spend your way out of debt, take more loans to pay off your loans, it is common sense. The country has advantages that the common man does not but this does not prevent the reality of our debt or the £43 billion a year the taxpayer pays in interest on our debt alone. That's just under half of the budget for the NHS. In terms of ideology I find myself at odds with those who think economics to be a zero-sum game. Taxing the rich is not an inherently good thing that magically betters the life of the poor.

I have had multiple negative experiences with first generation immigrants over the last few years, including violent attacks on my person and being forced out of my former home. The culture of my city has changed for the worse over years, the city centre transformed into something more unpleasant.

I cannot disagree with you more about Labour and the economy due to the current debt and deficit issues being started by Labour. We cannot spend tomorrow's money forever.

The Greens have no leg to stand on economically. Where is all the money they plan to spend going to come from? The rich? People who will flee the moment their wealth is threatened seriously. Such people who can only maintain their wealth by continual investment. I don't buy the idea that they are magical job creators or saviours of the economy and I certainly don't buy the idea that the rich are evil bogeymen who's wallets can always be raided to satiate the envy of others.

&gt; At 15-18, you don't have much idea of what the world of work is really like. Is sexism (or even gender balance) a real consideration at that point, when choosing your next steps through the education system?

Being male - I don't know.  I'd like to think no, but I worry that the ingrained prejudice of career advisers maybe partly to blame.  It's lots of little things I'm sure none of which can be focused on quite like the obvious missing equality in pay which is now enshrined in law.

Even things like when you see a friends female child, you walk up and say ""isn't she pretty?"" rather than ""isn't she smart""  You are pointing out that society is valuing her looks over her smarts.

It's little ingrained things like this which will take the longest to change, as you cannot actively legislate/demonstrate them.  It is just 'societies mood'.

However, a good example of where this is possible is the UK's attitude to drinking and driving.  I think I saw on here a few days ago an old drink-driving advert and the text was ""Isn't four enough?""

Compare that to today's message of ""is one, one too many?""

If they had started at the extreme it would have failed, but they just gradually changed social perception and tolerance.  It went from ""I'm a strong man and can safely drive while pissed"" to ""how dare you endanger yourself and other people?""

It might sound super new age or hippy but I think that there is some real credibility in people feeling better for being in control or a part of their actual treatment or recovery. Gardening is known to increase ones well being and producing your own medicine is one of the best feelings out there. 

I personally like some of the laws in I think its California where dispensaries have to donate a percentage of their top shelf (best quality) medicine to low income patients and in the case of Berkley homeless medical patients. 


If a percentage of the people that are reliant on the NHS for their opioids (tramadol,codiene,morph etc) , benzodiazepines, NSAIDs and Antidepressants instead started to grow the plants that they over time have found to work best for their specific needs then surely that is a good thing  economically for the NHS &amp; to an extent the Government.

If I can grow a couple of plants throughout the year and not have to keep going to the pharmacy every 2 weeks to pick up bags of pills then I think that's better for everyone. I do no harm to anybody and my money is being spent legitimately instead of going to the black market. 

Its easy to forget just how life consuming/hindering these prescriptions can be for people, when I was using morphine and benzodiazepines I couldn't just stop taking them to be in my sharpest state for a job interview. 

Now as a medical user of cannabis  I can stop for a day or two before hand (or use topicals/tincture) and whilst the pain does come back I'm not in withdrawal or putting myself at risk of seizure or death. Imagine again how many people in similar situations to myself ignore the warning labels on the medicine out of necessity and get behind the wheel?  
I'd much prefer medical cannabis users (those with a tolerance) behind the wheel over drunk or overly medicated drivers since it takes about an hour or two to reasonably 'sober' up after a joint but after a few drinks or tablets you can be out of it for far longer. Ideally of course no one would drive after taking anything.


But I also completely understand that some patients and their family's (cancer patients/ms etc) do feel more comfortable with their medicine coming from someone like GW pharma who are held to much higher scrutiny and esteem than others who don't have a stock listing, but produce consistent product at a much higher price. 

Personally I have no problem with a doctor prescribing cannabis for writers block - its known to promote creativity , help with depression/anxiety and or fatigue/insomnia. All of which can cause or be caused by writers block.  

Whats the problem in the patients doctor giving him a card that allows him to grow 4-6 plant or purchase from a dispensary without fear of arrest or violence for growing or purchasing cannabis illegitimately. 

What else would a doctor prescribe for something like writers block? Ritalin? Antidepressants? Tranquilizers? Therapy?  

I know a few people might turn to cigarettes and alcohol , maybe other drugs.

Sorry, but they're far from alone on that, and I don't honestly see why it's even a problem. If you're going to assert that halving the name of where someone's from is automatically racist, you're looking for excuses. If someone says 'paki bastards!' (or whatever), it's no different from calling someone a 'black bastard'. Is the person a racist idiot? Yes, because they're drawing attention to that persons' heritage as if that somehow signifies something - but the word 'black' doesn't then become a no-no just because some idiot uses it in that way.

You're also forgetting terms like 'Paki Shop', Which is actually a term of reverence, honour and gratitude - it's hard to find other shops (outside of mega-tescos and the like that usually need a car to get to) where the staff will work all hours every day just so you can buy some fags at midnight. Nobody calls them Paki Shops 'because they're run by dirty Pakis and I wouldn't go in there anyway'.

Many also don't use 'chinky' in a racist term either - unless you know of other restaurants that can produce a chicken &amp; sweetcorn soup that has similar mystical healing properties. Again, 'do you fancy a Chinky' is saying 'I love Chinese food, shall we have some' - anything further is projecting issues onto a conversation *that didn't contain them*.

Ultimately, you can't really dictate that a word that has many uses, by many different people can *only* be classed as demeaning or derogatory *because you say so* - suggesting that's it's the OP that's confused more than the media.

---

&gt;The __[Washington Redskins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins) name controversy__ involves the name and logo of the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League) (NFL) franchise located in the [Washington, D.C. metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area). Native American individuals, tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of the name and image for decades. Over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts have published resolutions or policies that state that the use of [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States) names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of [ethnic stereotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_stereotyping) that promote misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.  The Washington, D.C. team is only one example of the larger controversy, but it receives the most public attention due to the name itself being defined as derogatory or insulting in modern dictionaries, and the prominence of the team representing the [nation's capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.).

I get what you're trying to say, but you've got your terminology slightly wrong.  Cannabis is the genus of plants that include three species: Cannabis Sativa, Cannabis Indica and Cannabis Ruderalis.

Marijuana (skunk, pot, etc), is more specifically the flowers of the cannabis plant that are smoked to get high.  It's also called just ""cannabis"", but that's a bit like saying a filet mignon steak is ""cow"".  

Hemp is the common name for low-THC varieties that are grown for fibre, oil, seed, etc.  e.g. hemp fibre, hemp oil, hemp seed, etc.  But it's still the cannabis plant, like saying a leather jacket is also ""cow"".

So there *isn't* a difference between hemp and cannabis, because hemp *is* cannabis.  The difference you're trying to highlight is between marijuana (cannabis to get high on) and hemp (cannabis to not get high on).

This article paints a less than positive picture: http://www.scotsman.com/news/comment-north-sea-oil-puts-finances-on-slippery-slope-1-3598889 

&gt;Here in Scotland a lower oil price has coincided with sharp cost increases for the industry, driving down pre-tax returns for the UK sector to their lowest level for four years. Last month Oil &amp; Gas UK submitted evidence to a Treasury consultation pointing to what it called “the deteriorating economics” of the mature UK Continental Shelf. 

...

&gt;Oil &amp; Gas UK chief executive Malcolm Webb last week said: “Profitability on the UKCS is insufficient to maintain the uncompetitive high tax rates of 62 – 81 per cent paid by production companies.

...
&gt; Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, warned last week: “Ironically, some of what motorists have gained from falling oil prices could be taken by the Chancellor. If the cost of oil drops just a few more dollars, and Mr Osborne sticks to his 2011 plans, then fuel duty is in line for a 1.7p a litre increase. That is unlikely to go down well with 38 million drivers who have recently had some relief at the pumps.”

Also, Saudi Arabia has since tightened supply at the Opec meeting on 27 November. http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/27/us-opec-meeting-idUSKCN0JA0O320141127

I wonder if this is the beginning of long-term problems for the UKCS, or if this is just a new platform for energy companies to lobby for lower taxes.

Which a) isn't mine (and a lot of others) history. The word 'black' has a history of being misused, but that doesn't mean I (or black people, for that matter) are going to stop using it. If anything, I'd say it's important to *not* reduce someone's country name to a racist term *because other people have used it as such*. I'm not sure I've even ever *heard* anyone use 'Chinky' as a slur, which I should have by now having lived/ worked in London for fourty-odd years.

&gt;I'm not sure how you've managed to convince yourself that ""Paki shop"" is a term is a term of reverence, honour and gratitude.

You didn't read any of my statement about the why, I guess, since you're asking. Not sure why you seem to think it's a 'me' thing and in no way common. This isn't something I've decided on my own, sorry if that doesn't fit with your view.

Sure, I just didn't get sacked *from a hospital* for over a decade for doing so. I guess they just didn't speak to you :-). There's nothing I can do about what people think of me - if they need excuses like this to think badly, that speaks more of their own issues that my outlook. Oddly, they generally don't (which is why I'm still friends with a large number of them, despite leaving fifteen years ago).

&gt;If I went into my corner shop and said ""oh my, really nice paki shop you've got here"" I would not be walking out of there.

I'm not sure there was ever a need...but then, would I need to remind them? What about if you said 'see, these idiot racists can complain about Paki shops, but you guys are open all hours and have been lifesavers more times than I can count'? It's really not that hard. When we lived in Beckenham, I was good friends with the guys running the Paki Shop on the corner of the roundabout. Again, it was never raised as an issue. Do you need more examples? Or do you really, seriously think that Pakistanis genrally see English as racist idiots?

&gt;It is not up to you to decide what is offensive and what isn't.

I'm not doing that, though. You are.

&gt;As you say, if one person finds offence to these words, you shouldn't use them.

Which means you can't use any words about anyone, anywhere, ever, Because *one person* has issues of their own that you wouldn't want to offend. 

&gt;Calling chinese food ""chinky"" is not the same and you know it.

I was referring to the title and how it's another word that can be used racially but generally isn't. And you know it.

false,octopus-crime,null,null,"&gt; Not a mention of our national debt I see. Is that not an issue?

Actually it isn't, and has never been. Another great example of smoke and mirrors used by teh Tories to frighten the population into accepting austerity, and the other parties being too paralysed to do anything but go with that narrative. All countries are in debt, all the time. So are you, if you have a mortgage; do you panic and try to pay your mortgage off in 5 years instead of 20 just because someone tells you that you're, say, £120,000 in debt? Of course you don't, and neither should any sensible government. Governments pay their debt the same way you pay your mortgage (though it's all more complex than that, the analogy will suffice for a basic understanding of the issue). As long as the country retains it's credit rating, payments get made and life goes on. 

Until austerity. By choking the life out of the actual economy and stagnating what was a slow but steady recovery under Labour, the Tories ended up not only endangering our credit rating, not only forced millions of Brits into hardship, but also ended up borrowing *more* money than all of the last few Labour governments combined. You want to talk about a debt crisis? The Conservatives took a stable economy and created a crisis where there was none. And UKIP have no different ideas, which means that whether you choose Conservative or UKIP, your vote will be a vote for a very badly broken Britain. They've already crippled our economy, but another 5 years of this might destroy it for a generation.

&gt;You do not spend your way out of debt, take more loans to pay off your loans, it is common sense. 

Actually it isn't. It's not about getting people to take loans, it's about ensuring people get decently paid for their work, and that the crushing pressure is taken off them financially by regulating such things as rapacious energy companies, bank charges, payday loans companies. A living wage would do more for the economy and more reliably than any amount of desperate sandbagging, because as I explained elsewhere, ordinary people spending their money is what makes an economy stronger. So yes, we actually *do* spend our way out of a recession. That's how it works. Money pumps into the arteries of the nation (shops, businesses) and creates more jobs, more shops, more business, and the recovery begins. That's why the economy strengthened when the minimum wage came in, instead of tanking as the Conservatives were threatening.

&gt;I have had multiple negative experiences with first generation immigrants over the last few years, including violent attacks on my person and being forced out of my former home. The culture of my city has changed for the worse over years, the city centre transformed into something more unpleasant.

So you have some anecdoteal evidence to make you dislike immigrants. I have anecdotal evidence that suggests thath white working class people are violent, aggressive, obnoxious racist thugs. The difference between you and me is that I can see that a noisy minority in no way represents the decent majority. That's the road of bigotry no matter how you want to paint it; tarring an entire people with the same brush because *you* have had one or two bad experiences.

&gt; I cannot disagree with you more about Labour and the economy due to the current debt and deficit issues being started by Labour. We cannot spend tomorrow's money forever.

For all of your supposed political education, your understanding and knowledge of economics is embarrassingly Daily Mail. The economy under Labour was stronger than it's been for decades; gone was teh boom and bust of the Thatcher years, to be replaced by a slow, steady stability that was brought about by regulation and helping the poor to find their feet. Yes, Labour spent a lot on welfare...which as I've explained, all went back into the economy. You have to pay something for a strong economy, and thath's worth spending tomorrow's money on because as long is it all stays in balance, you'll always be good for those payments in the future. This is how national economies have functioned since time immemorial. 

Under Labour the debt reached its lowest point since the sixties, and interest paid on the debt reached it's lowest point since the Great War. Taking your economic opinions from the pages of the papers does not give you an education in economics, my friend. Only looking at the actual figures will do that and then, in that cold light of understanding, you will realise just how much you've bought into a massive crock of bullshit designed to make you and every other non wealthy person in the UK wear a horsehair shirt and like it. 

Aside from the neoliberal mistake of deregulating the banks, which was a small contribution towards the global banking crisis of 2007, (though arguably Gordon Brown's very clever manipulation of the economy buffered us against the worst effects of that awful event - other countries were hit much harder) Labour saved the economy from the usual Conservative mismanagement. Their neoliberal theories are bankrupt, have always been so. Every time neoliberals take charge of an economy and impose ideological cuts to the poor and tax breaks for the 'wealth creators', wealth gets sucked into the pockets of the wealthy and the economy suffers. Every time a more Keynesian approach is taken, balance is restored and the economy stabilises again. Reality in economics has something of a left wing bias these days, it seems.

&gt;The Greens have no leg to stand on economically. Where is all the money they plan to spend going to come from? The rich? People who will flee the moment their wealth is threatened seriously.

Don't be naive. You really think Vodafone will flee the UK because we ask them to pay the £5 billion in tax they should have paid a few years ago? Any company that owes £5 BILLION in tax makes BILLIONS MORE in profit. That really would be like cutting off your head to spite your face. No, in reality companies will just sigh and comply, as they always do in these situations because they are about profit, and shutting down your operation just to avoid paying some tax is not a profitable way to operate. And those few that do leave? Let them; what are they bringing to this country if they are not paying enough in tax? Other homegrown companies will fill the void they leave and retain the employment.

The fact is that there is enough money owed each year in tax that is legally avoided to genuinely make a huge inroad into the deficit, not that we need to as we've already covered earlier. In reality, it would be used to pay for things like a guaranteed minimum income (a genius idea that would guarantee an exceptional economy and make far more employment opportunities than any amount of tax breaks to companies by putting a decent amount of spending power in the hands of the poorest in society. I guarantee that every single penny the country has to pay in that will flow directly into the economy and, eventually, into the tax coffers.

&gt;Cutting the wealthy down will not solve our problems. Tall poppy syndrome is a curse upon our beloved country. You may claim that I see immigrants as a bogeyman but your bogeyman appears to be the rich.

Cutting them down and transferring their obscene and unnecessary levels of wealth to the rest of the population actually would make a huge difference to the economy. Have a stab at how much the high band tax rate was in the US when it started to finally climb out of the Great Depression. No? 65%. So to use one piece of history to rebut your claim, actually cutting down the wealthy to redistribute their money *does* solve some of the problems. The danger lies in people like you who gain a little knowledge, enough to argue down your average lefty on the street, but not enough to really understand the larger scale issues of economics; you silence opposition, or try to, by blinding people with science, and then you all go and vote for your own destruction. Hopefully you'll go away and learn some actual economics and stop learning it from bullshit neoliberal publications and texts.

I'm sure you're aware of the effect. Putting one's face that close to someone else's and staring into their eyes is how primates square off for a fight. Regardless of our veneer of civilisation, when someone does that to us, it causes instinctive physical responses: adrenaline, nervousness... back down or lash out. (Or, apparently, in the case of the celebrity bikes you like to hang out with, swoon.) I'm sure that, like turning up with a megaphone instead of an appointment, such an aggressive invasion of personal space makes for great footage: you keep talking to someone in that chatty reasonable affable tone of yours, and they react with anger.

&gt;Not sure why you seem to think it's a 'me' thing and in no way common.

It's a stereotype from the 50s, back when it had some basis in truth, and it belongs back there.

We do have Greek corner shops and German corner shops, and the reason they're not as recognised is because people like you strengthen this stupid stereotype that corner shops are a Pakistani thing. It has nothing to do with differences in convenience.

The idea that taxes and spending will be immediately affected by ""this new reality"" is quite simplistic. Had Scotland voted for independence, the oil prices could well rise by 2016 and if they didn't there are many factors that determine taxes and spending.

I'll just have to live with that. Along with all the Chinese/ Indian/ Pakinstani people I work with (or have *ever* worked with - you are aware of the racial mix/ prevalent country of origin in Whitechapel, I take it?)

&gt;Not getting sacked from your job isn't some sort of badge of honour

No, it's an example of people *not taking offense*. Over a ten year period. Longer, in fact.

&gt;or any indication that what you were doing was not wrong.

See above. Only one of us is presenting an absolute.

&gt;I would hope, if someone asked you to stop using those terms, that you would, and not rebuke them by insisting that the word itself isn't offensive.

Indeed - I won't eat meat if someone's coming over that's a vegetarian; but that doesn't mean I'll stop eating meat, and it's not the same as avoiding a word *just in case* - that way lies madness, as you can never win; you'll always offend *someone*. If the offense was taken as often as you're implying, someone *somewhere* would have said something by now. In fact, someone *white* would have said something by now.

&gt; I would also hope you are more selective in your usage of said word.

I wouldn't say I'm not selective as it is - it's not a phrase I look for excuses to use because it's really not that important or significant.

&gt; Saying paki around pakistanis, and chinky around chinese people just makes you sound like an idiot.

* Capital of Culture 2008 – 'The World in One City' (you can look at the awarding rationale online)

* Established the 'Merseybeat' scene and home to the world's most famous and recognisable music band: Beatles. (Matthew Street and the Cavern Club are cultural powerhouses unto themselves)

They also offer an 11th sonic, but it's inability to extend, and misplaced activation button, it's really more of a display piece.


If you're looking for the most accurate Sonic Screwdriver possible, you can try [The Celestial Toystore](http://www.celestialtoystore.com)

All their props are produced with measurements taken from screen used pieces, constructed of the same original materials and are immaculate in every respect. Their 11th Doctor Sonic has an internal redesign that made it almost indestructible. It's a [fully flickable](http://gfycat.com/TangibleMediumDrever), very loud, true to the original replica of the Series 5 hero prop. They're currently out of 10th Doctor Sonics until next year, but they offer the only accurate 9th Doctor Sonic out there.

If you want one made by the show's prop maker, you can try [Rubbertoe Replicas](http://www.rubbertoereplicas.com/)

Their sonic is accurate to the Series 8 Sonics Screwdrivers used by Peter Capaldi, and comes without sound by default. For an additional fee, they'll add sound, but they do in fact use the sound chip from the Character Options plastic toy.

There's no discrimination, no institutional misogyny, no glass ceiling at play here. There is not a pay gap between men and women because they're men and women, there's a pay gap between professions and the gender balance of those professions is not equal.

Women are *electing* to enter lower-paying professions. Engineering schools don't impose quotas on how many women can apply, nor do Medical Schools prevent women applying for surgical specialisms, and so on.

No one harks on about the pay gap between shelf stackers and scientists: the pay gap between men and women is a non-story artificially blown up by feminists who see it as something to shout about without taking a single moment to examine the actual data. 

The most, the *absolute most* you can draw from this 'issue' is that women seem to prefer social professions over technical professions.

The UK has a history. That history is, to understate it, amongst the most horrible stories that can be told. The Empire was built on racism. Our culture still bears the scars of that time. The slurs being discussed in this thread are part of that scar tissue. They bear the weight and history of racism, exploitation, and colonialism.

Yes, they do mean ""a person from a place"". But they also carry the degrading and dehumanising history with them. Whether you like it or not.

Conversely, ""Pakeha"" in New Zealand is the indigineous Maori word for European. It can sometimes be used hurtfully, but it is mostly used in common parlance. The difference is that Pakeha comes from the people who were exploited by the colonisers, not the other way around. When someone is called Pakeha, there is no baggage that reminds them of the pain and suffering of their history, no implied supremacy. If anything it can be unpleasant because it reminds you of the privilege you have because of your race; it can be humbling.

What I am trying to say is that when a person uses a slur, ignorant of the hurt it causes, it is up to you to not stand by and to tell them ""Hey, that language is not okay.

Why would I identify with people like that? At the risk of invoking Godwin, do you blame seventeen year old Germans for the war? That's the road you're going down.

&gt;Are you seriously saying that?

No, I'm rebutting your assertion of the above.

&gt;I suppose the history behind the word ""nigger"" has nothing to do with you either then, so it must be cool to call people that too.

Why? Is there a 'Niggerland' that I don't know about? A word that *only* exists because it's a term of abuse isn't the same as a word that forms half of the country of origins' name, and when it's used in terms of praise (Chinky=Chinese Meal=Gorgeous), people are going to take offense when it's automatically assumed that they're being offensive. Context is everything.

&gt;rather than ""black"", which has never been an offensive term

You don't remember why people started using the world 'coloured', then?

&gt;Whether it's common or not has absolutely no bearing on whether it's okay.

Right, because 10% of people using a term in a racist fashion means that the other 90% are racist too...er...

&gt;People from all over the world run corner shops, and I'm sure there isn't something about being Pakistani that makes them more efficient at it than anyone else.

Yes they do, but it was the Pakistanis that made it so - do they not deserve credit for that? A chinese takeaway could be run by Polish, but it would still be a Chinky. And I'd still be praising the chinese for creating it in the first place. Of course, I could praise the Poles too, but we wouldn't want to stereotype anyone with praise, would we?

&gt;It's a stereotype from the 50s, back when it had some basis in truth

Oh, we would...OK, why don't we deal with negative stereotypes first then, yes? Otherwise you're then 'calling me out' for *praising someone based on their own history*. And you're so apparently desperate to paint that negatively that doing so leaves you 'lost for words'. Maybe if you concentrated on less lazy arguments you'd be able to consistently read...or, hell, ask questions instead of providing a list of incorrect conclusions that I have to then address.

&gt;Here's a crazy idea: how about they decide what they want to be called?

You mean like everyone else does? I'd love to know how you can make sure every person in the country uses your definitions or terms and no-one else's.

&gt;Who are you to tell them what they have to be okay with?

I don't have to, because it's never been an issue. Which is worse, someone using a term in a positive way that you've also heard from other individuals as abuse, or asserting that anyone using the term is automatically abusive/ racist/ etc.?

Different boroughs have different rules. Some areas you have to pay (Westminster, £1 a day to obtain a permit, you can park to different places as many times as you like -  unless they have changed the rules since last time). 

In some other boroughs you can park for free but only at certain locations. Some bike parking locations require permits. PIE's [Parking for Bikes](http://www.parkingforbikes.com/) site shows where the parking locations are, if they require permits or free or pay by phone (i.e., Westminster). 

Each bay should have a sign for the period you can use it, if it is pay by phone etc., if none is displayed, then it's a free one. Most multi-storey places also have free bike parking.

Social skill that some people lack? Possibly, I have Aspergers, but still - there's no fundamental law handed down from the universe that says these words are offensive but those ones aren't. If ""chinky"" is offensive, there must be something about its meaning or how it's normally used that makes it offensive. If simply meaning ""Chinese"" makes it offensive, then the word ""Chinese"" should be just as offensive.

As far as I've ever been aware, ""chinky"" has never been used in my presence as anything other than a neutral word meaning ""Chinese"".

Casual racism I understand, but there has to be a reason why the ""casual racism"" behavior is considered racist in the first place. If people are just using a word because people use that word, that's just word-meaning. And if people aren't even aware that a word's meant to be offensive when they use it, obviously it's not being used to be offensive.

And BTW, if you need arguments like ""if you were alone in a room full of people from the particular community"", you're basically saying people should work out whether something is offensive by already knowing it's offensive. More to the point, what you're really doing is appealing to intuition and to the same conformity instincts that substantially contribute to prejudice in the first place. People aren't supposed to know what is offensive and why, they're just supposed to have been conditioned to what is normal and expected in a certain kind of situation.

It got a lot of comments, many of them worthwhile and good for discussion.

I think part of the problem with your post from yesterday is that none of us can really say what person X would do if they were managing us. We can only really say what WE would do. I get that different managers have different styles, but do you really expect a bunch of people to post comments that amount to basically saying Klopp and Rafa would a) organize the defense better, b) play with a DM and c) probably use a counter-attack?

People want to give their opinions on things, not guess at the opinions of other people. If you want to get a tactical discussion going, ask people for their own ideas. It works (almost) every time.

The nation would not have the wealth that was suggested, would not have the tax and spending regime that was suggested, would not have the exploitable natural resources that was suggested.

Also, the SNP contribute just as much to inequality as the Tories. Frozen council tax puts more money in the pockets of the rich (higher bands) than the poor, shooting down proposals to have the living wage as part of government-issued contracts, slashing college places (traditionally working class dominated) for University places (traditionally middle and upper class dominated), cutting teacher numbers, taking powers away from local councils, not (despite the Smith Commission proposing fully devolving all income tax and Scottish Labour making the pledge) pledging to return the 50p tax band, proposing a cut to corporation tax.

The SNP don't do wealth redistribution either. They pay middle class kids through University, give everyone free prescriptions (when, in England, you get them free anyway if you're out of work or have a permanent medical condition), and starve councils of their funding by freezing council tax (when the least wealthy use those services the most and the most wealthy pocket the biggest savings).",0,1418832940,null,0,false,0,cmxnh2o,t3_2pi2lw,t1_cmxnh2o,t1_cmxmmug,null,1425353740,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As such, they play all over the pitch, in different positions so they learn what other players in different positions want and how to mix it up a bit. I think that's why E. Dier was such a great purchase, he knows the game well and can play everywhere. It's why he scored those two goals in the early part of the season. But that's just my own opinion. 

He still knows what he's talking about with Eriksen though. Why he did so well on the left for Sherwood I think too.",0,1418833279,null,0,1418833497,0,cmxnne0,t3_2pkpeu,t1_cmxnne0,t1_cmxlpnd,null,1425353658,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Look at medicine: every female medical student is as capable as their male counterparts, each achieved just highly in their exams to merit entry to medical schools, and each receives just as much support as the other.

Women are extremely under-represented in all surgical specialisms, which are the highest paid.

Society is clearly not putting women off of medical careers (in fact the General Medical Council expects there'll be more women doctors than male doctors by 2017), yet they select specialisms that are less well paid.

I contend your balances shown in China and Malaysia are actually evidence of the opposite. In China, a technical education is lauded, it's expected.

I was on the receiving end of this personally: years ago when I was taking driving lessons my instructor went to pick up her next student and asked me to sit in the back during his lesson so I could get dropped off en route. It was dark and the student could see me in the back but didn't notice that I'm Asian/Pakistani. He hopped in and made a remark to the instructor that he'd been 'working like a Paki' all day.

Objectively there's nothing offensive about that. Paki is just short for Pakistani, and literally means 'one who is pure'. And he was remarking on how hard we work! But when he noticed me he went bright red and couldn't apologise enough, saying that he never would have said it if he'd noticed me before. 

I didn't give him too hard of a time but I did have to ask if it's not ok to say in front of me, why is it ok to say at all? 

Some words/phrases aren't offensive in and of themselves, but because of their historical context and the way they've been used in the past.

Our economy certainly was not stable under Labour during the financial crisis. At this point I feel you are trumpeting ideology over facts.

You talk at length about my apparently poor knowledge of economics but any sensible person knows that economics is forever in a boom and bust cycle, it's just natural.

You do raise a good point about Labour doing well with the debt under its early years of tenure at the beginning of the 2000's but this does not correct the wrong that they did towards the end of their tenure.

If I have some advice to you, it's to try and politely get your points across without resorting to personal attacks in almost every paragraph of yours. Disagreeing with your views is not grounds for insulting language.

&gt;And those few that do leave? Let them; what are they bringing to this country if they are not paying enough in tax? Other homegrown companies will fill the void they leave and retain the employment.

Oh I certainly agree but my point was specifically about the Greens raising tax to spectacular levels. I don't think they care much for the economic plight of companies who they would tax to the hilt and then some more. Every pound taking in tax is one taken away from reinvestment and expansion of the company, a detriment to the economic success of the company. This taken to an extreme means thin profit margins and a lack of job creation. As with all things a balance must be made. Current levels of taxation are okay for the larger companies but I worry for the economic health of the country if they are taxed in accordance with Green policies.

I fully agree with cracking down on tax avoidance. I would like to see the full amount recouped by the treasury with custodial sentences for particularly flagrant abuses. I think it the height of injustice to punish the working poor and those on benefits while letting those with wealth act dishonestly. Abuse of wealth is far more dangerous than a poor person fiddling their benefits.

The Green's policy of universal benefits for all citizens is perhaps their only policy I support. I perhaps differ in my reasoning though, in that I see it as dramatically cutting down the need for bureaucracy and civil service positions.

&gt;Have a stab at how much the high band tax rate was in the US when it started to finally climb out of the Great Depression. No? 65%.

High taxation of income is not the same as taxing wealth. It has little effect on the actual wealth which is then filed away into stock options or hidden accounts. The rich have many, many options for gaining and moving wealth between each other. A high tax rate is more likely to butcher the middle classes who are then punished for their success, for their hard earned wealth. I don't disagree with the general idea of taxing the rich, I disagree with the idea that raising the tax on the rich is some kind of flawless panacea. There are harsh consequences for heavy taxation.

&gt;Hopefully you'll go away and learn some actual economics and stop learning it from bullshit neoliberal publications and texts. Their theories have been disproven every time their adherents get into power.

I began my education on economics with Eric Hobsbawm when I was a proper socialist so I'm more knowledgable on left wing economic theory than right wing. I've yet to read anything by mises or friedman.

I can't say much more about this because I'm not paying attention to it that much, but privatization is a separate issue from the concept of ""free"" universal healthcare.

It leads to better competition (thus lower prices for the same care, thus you can afford more care), but at the same time they're trying to make a profit (prices go up).

A more interesting analysis by Nevin would be to ask why/how/when people in the FA, at clubs, and even at the grassroots level are making these decisions.

A good example to highlight how ""easy"" (it is not really easy) it is to change this is Arsene Wenger.

We don't really have the oldest civil nuclear power programme. The US was the first to generate electricity using nuclear power, Russia were the first to build a power station (a few MWe), we just built a slightly larger plant and called it commercial. In reality, the Calder Hall reactors were only 'civil' in the loosest sense of the word in the early decades of operation. If the US or USSR had bothered to stick a turbine on one of their production reactors, they'd have been well ahead.

Nobody is going to out-PWR the Americans anyway, so it's kind of pointless not to buy their reactors. Following this reasoning, we did actually buy Westinghouse, although Gordon Brown sold them to Toshiba. No British government likes the idea of the state owning a commercially successful company (votes can be bought by subsidising uneconomic industries but will be lost if the govt. screws up a winner), so that did make some sense. Given that nobody can compete with the Americans on LWRs without being a state-owned company, if we want to develop a reactor someone will buy, it has to offer something different. AGR was safer and more efficient and was supposed to be more reliable, so if it had worked as planned it might have done the job.

when i brought some of them to my off-season, collegiate training sessions, half of them were puking by the end of the endurance training (and if they weren't puking, they finished minutes behind me and my teammates) and could not hang with me on most of the footwork, sprints and lifting (i outsquatted the entire baseball team and i wasn't even the strongest on my squad). obviously different people, different places mean different things, but do you think red sox players view lfc players as at least equals in athletic terms?

That's fine by me, but the context here was someone being widely attacked because of assumptions about why they used the word. Of course the context in this case is a lot more complex than just that, but still, the use of that word is being considered a ""crime"" in itself.

&gt;  ""oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise. I'll stop saying/doing that.""

You're hurting me here by (the appearance of) not just assuming that I can't figure that out myself, but also by expecting me to believe that it really works in practice - a belief that can get someone with Aspergers into worse problems. The number of times I've ended up with bruises because I followed someones good-intentioned but naive advice is crazy. All those simple rules are only simple because endless ""don't be absurd, that's obvious"" exceptions are left unstated.

OK, you're not hurting me - I'm just making a point - but the point is I think valid.

My experience is that saying ""oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise"" is very often an open invitation for judgement and attack. People don't understand *how* you couldn't know so they make rationalizations about how. Explain how and usually that's considered an excuse, and certainly taken as proof that you're ""not sorry"". What you have to do is passively accept being the target of the temper tantrum. Being unable to show the proper contrition face is a problem, but as I said, it's still better to just let people get their anger out of there system as much as possible, however misplaced that anger is.

Besides, either you end up never saying anything as almost everything becomes taboo (as many Aspies do, resulting in further assumptions of rejecting people) or you have to keep tracking the contexts where things are offensive. To decide that you shouldn't say ""chinky"" when Chinese people will hear and may be hurt means you're behaving differently depending on whether there's Chinese people around. That's (1) a whole bunch of things for a person with Aspergers to keep track of when already overloaded with the problem of coping with other people, and (2) re-inforcement of the habit of treating Chinese people differently to everyone else.

Anyway. You don't NEED to contact the HMRC before you start your new job. When you give them your P45, that will get sent off and you would probably get your refund through that, either put straight into your pay or by cheque in the post.

However, if it was me, I wouldn't leave it to chance, especially if you don't have a new job lined up yet and you might need money to tide you over. It's super easy to get sorted. Just phone them up and give them your name and NI number. They check it all and send you what you're due. I didn't even have to send off a P60 or anything.

But that means you are assuming that cultural pressure is the **only** thing that is making things unequal. What if men and women were different in the nature of things they seek as they are obviously different biologically (as you agree yourself)? Maybe those *societal pressures* you talk about are actually driven by our biologically programmed yearnings?

There have been studies (see video below) that support this and if you think about it from anthropological point of view it's just common sense. As you're posting a video here's one for you - [a Swedish documentary about gender equality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiJVJ5QRRUE). 

Sweden is a very feminist country and the government has made serious efforts to reduce the gender gap of people that go in nursing and engineering and yet the former is female dominated and the latter male. If you watch the documentary you will learn that the percentage of women in nursing and men in engineering in Sweden is actually higher than other much less feminist countries in Africa and Asia. Does that mean that people in Sweden have an even stronger cultural pressure to adhere to stereotypical gender roles? I don't think so - I think when truly given the freedom of choice men prefer to be breadwinners and women care givers. 

That *cultural pressure* you talk about is purely our natural alignment but feminism just won't admit it as it means admitting men and women are, in fact, different.

Oh really?

http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1/1bf6eb0a-4675-11db-ac52-0000779e2340.html#axzz3MB4tGd00 (Yes, even in this mealy mouthed FT article, they can't fault Labour's economic stability)

Even Wikipedia's page on the UK economy shows the huge smoothing of growth spikes that typify a stable economy. Given that I don't like the Labour party, I only vote for them to keep out the worse options, it's hardly ideological. Even hard right economists grudgingly admit that Brown was the best chancellor we've had for years.

&gt; I had a strong feeling you'd ask me to ignore the trauma I've endured.

No, I asked you not to take your personal anecdotes and then use them to tar all immigrants with that brush, because that is bigotry. How angry did you get there when you thought I was tarring white working class Brits as thugs? Did it upset you? So how do you think a kind, decent hard-working muslim or Polish family feels when people keep on talking about 'immigrants' and saying things like Romanian immigrants are all criminals, or that muslim immigrants are all terrorists. Are there immigrants who are dickheads? Of course there are, because there are always some people in any group who are dickheads. Does that then follow that all people in a group are dickheads? I don't know, you're white and working class - are you a racist bullying thug? And there is your answer.

&gt; Immigrants are not one people mate.

I never said they were, however Farage is saying that. He refers repeatedly to immigrants as a gestalt people. As do the media. They frame the debate and that is how it gets presented to people.

&gt; I am white working class.

*So am I*. I notice how you cunningly edit out the part where I say that ""The difference between you and me is that I can see that a noisy minority in no way represents the decent majority."" This is not a newspaper article where you can edit your opponent's statements to make them seem to be saying something else. Given the reasoned tone of the rest of your post, that was just disingenuous.

&gt;You talk at length about my apparently poor knowledge of economics but any sensible person knows that economics is forever in a boom and bust cycle, it's just natural.

Not always, there are smoother periods when governments with more social conscience come into power. The role of a government should be to shield the majority of poorer people from the pitfalls and bust of the cycles - if it has to be at the expense of the wealthy, then so be it - the pitfalls and troughs are usually their faults anyway.

&gt;You do raise a good point about Labour doing well with the debt under its early years of tenure at the beginning of the 2000's but this does not correct the wrong that they did towards the end of their tenure.

Such as?

&gt;If I have some advice to you, it's to try and politely get your points across without resorting to personal attacks in almost every paragraph of yours. Disagreeing with your views is not grounds for insulting language.

This is something we clearly both feel passionate about. I find it hard to believe that someone could look at the actual figures and support a UKIP government as anything other than more of the same, but worse. I get angry at their scapegoating (that frankly gets more ridiculous over time - immigration caused traffic on the M4, did it, Nigel? Did it really? Really?) and I get angry at people being hoodwinked into voting for them - and most of those voters *are* ignorant and believe what the media tells them.

&gt;Oh I certainly agree but my point was specifically about the Greens raising tax to spectacular levels. I don't think they care much for the economic plight of companies who they would tax to the hilt and then some more. Every pound taking in tax is one taken away from reinvestment and expansion of the company, a detriment to the economic success of the company.

You assume too much. You assume that every pound gets spent on expanding companies; it doesn't. Believe me, from small companies, through larger SMEs all the way to big corporations, those at the top of a company gleefully piss away the profits. In my time I've watched the owner of a chain of electrical shops buy himself a Bentley 10 months before his company went into administration and scratch his head wondering where it all went wrong; I've watched a local shop owner have to make two staff redundant, yet still have the cash to buy his wife a brand new 4x4, and himself a new BMW 6 series, then a £1200 guitar one month, then a £1000 amplifier the next. It's all well and good to beat one's chest and shout about the poor small businessman, but in my (and others') experience, they're as financially dumb as those higher up the chain. The difference is that when they fail, they fall on their arse. And they should. 

&gt;This taken to an extreme means thin profit margins and a lack of job creation. 

This was all said during the period leading up to the minimum wage. It's an empty argument that gets disproved time after time after time in practice. It actually ends up leading to *more* job creation. Don't agree? Look at unemployment figures for the UK after the minimum wage came in. The only way you could possibly disagree with that is if you are letting ideology speak on your behalf.

&gt;I fully agree with cracking down on tax avoidance. I would like to see the full amount recouped by the treasury with custodial sentences for particularly flagrant abuses. I think it the height of injustice to punish the working poor and those on benefits while letting those with wealth act dishonestly. Abuse of wealth is far more dangerous than a poor person fiddling their benefits.

Something we can definitely both agree on. But then why vote for another party that is rampant with millionaire funders, ex-bankers, ex-Tories and cronyism before they've even had any election success? And that's not even counting Farage's proposed tax cuts that will once again leave the rich getting the best part of the deal.

&gt;The Green's policy of universal benefits for all citizens is perhaps their only policy I support. I perhaps differ in my reasoning though, in that I see it as dramatically cutting down the need for bureaucracy and civil service positions.

It will definitely do that. Especially under Ian Duncan Smith, the DWP has become an inefficient mess of wastage. Current estimates put the bill for Universal Credit at over £600 million. Universal income would sweep all of that aside.

&gt;High taxation of income is not the same as taxing wealth. It has little effect on the actual wealth which is then filed away into stock options or hidden accounts. The rich have many, many options for gaining and moving wealth between each other. 

I think you misunderstood, that was the *top* rate of tax for high earners, not for everyone. The way to avoid squeezing the middle is to do this; to focus high taxation on the very wealthy, and to bring capital gains tax in line with income tax to avoid the usual trick of the wealthy of funneling it through the cheaper system. Close the loopholes. Those who pay the most proportion of their income in tax should always be those who benefit the most from the society in which they make their money.

I'm sorry that I made you feel patronised. I may be a naive idealist, but I would give similar advice to anyone, because I genuinely believe that a lot of liberal morality can be broken down to simple rules like this, but I understand why it was problematic here.

I'd like to talk about point (2) at the very end there.

I have a friend who cannot stand the sound of people eating. He cannot be in the same room as other people eating. Those of us who know him treat him differently. When he arrives, we instantly stop eating. We plan gatherings with a special eating space.

I have a couple of friends who are trans-gendered, or gender fluid. I treat them differently. I have to make sure I use the right pronouns.

I have some friends who are rape survivors. I treat them differently. I don't talk about rape around them.

My point is that equality doesn't mean treating everyone the same, it means treating everyone as individuals. Every individual will have certain things that upset them, that hurt them or remind them of painful times. You can't make a rule for ""all chinese people"", because they aren't all the same.

Besides, ""paki"" is like ""nigger"" - as you say, it's the baggage because of the way the word is widely used, irrespective of whether that was the intent at the time. Some things really are just obviously loaded (which is *really* annoying because there's no clear objective boundary).

I've said before that ideally, ""nigger"" wouldn't be considered an offensive word. For racism to truly be dead, the word wouldn't have any baggage any more - if people knew it at all, it would be as ancient history or as a neutral variant of ""Nigerian"" or refering to the Niger valley or whatever. Of course I was attacked as a racist for saying it, and to be fair plenty of people make excuses where they deny the words they use carry any baggage though it's perfectly obvious the baggage is what they used the words for.

""Working like a Paki"" is a weird one. I've heard it, but these days a common stereotype for Pakistanis is of laziness. The same group being labelled as having to do all the hard/shitty work because low status, and also as too lazy to work. To me, that explains why logic is important in issues around prejudice and discrimination - logic certainly isn't inherently nice, but rationalizations for prejudice rarely if ever stand up to even that test. Relying on social norms to defeat prejudice seems bizarre - conformity to social norms is how prejudice spreads in the first place.

And consider this (by /u/ridiculousaurus from another thread):

&gt; You can't just count the number of pros and cons, they have to be weighed as well. Do fans from the middle east and money for a stadium and training facilities really carry the same weight as the fact that the club would be the willing plaything of the psychopathic despots of a modern theocratic dictatorship that unmercifully represses its subjects' freedom in any modern, Western sense of the world, and builds its country on what is literally (and I do mean literally) slave labour? I understand well that the prospect of seeing Spurs in a position to build a team like City or Chelsea is an ensnaring one, but there has to be a limit to what price we are willing to pay to get there.

This week about the EBT case

The Scottish Professional Football League is withholding £250,000 of broadcast money due to Rangers in a bid to recoup a fine imposed for the club's use of a controversial tax scheme.
Lord Nimmo Smith imposed the fine in February 2013 after finding Rangers broke league rules in their use of an employee benefit trust (EBT) scheme.
Rangers say they will appeal against the SPFL decision ""vigorously"".
They argue that the company in breach of the rules is being liquidated.

false,PRigby,eu,Irish,"&gt; because Scot isn't racist, Jap can be,

If the country was called Japland or Japistan then it would be fine, but it isn't. A person from Finland is a Finn, a person from Poland is a Pole. Why someone from England and Ireland isn't an Eng or an Ire respectively is probably because of crazy historical and etymological reasons (also it sounds silly)

The stan suffix means land of (in Turkish, Greece is Yunanistan coming from land of the Ionians) so removing the stan is *usually* the name of the people. Kurds are from Kurdistan, Uzbeks are from Uzbekistan. Pakistan seems to be the only exception that I can find. Paki has a history of abuse in the UK.

&gt; oriental is akin to european in my head.

The offense of Oriental comes from 'Oriental Studies' courses that used to be taught in Europe and the US. Mainly because in these courses oriental cultures were taught as being lesser, more primitive and often ignored their historical empires and contributions. And even though the term meant from the east it included North African cultures and would often leave out aboriginals and those north Asian cultures Russia pretends don't exist (and depending on where you learnt the topic would include/exclude the middle east and west Asia) it also merged cultures that were very different (putting turbans on Chinese people and junk)

It would be nice if we could start over and take a more measured response to the words we use and rely situational context, but historical context is hard to run from.

Edit: he has written an open letter in response.



Hello Jo, thanks for your open letter, I do remember you from the melee outside RBS and firstly, I’d like to say sorry for your paella getting cold. It’s not nice to suffer because of actions that are nothing to do with you. I imagine the disabled people of our country who have been hit with £6bn of benefit cuts during the period that RBS received £46bn of public bail-out money feel similarly cheesed off.
I can’t apologise for the RBS lockdown though mate because, I don’t have the authority to close great big institutions – even ones found guilty of criminal activity.
The locking of the doors and your tarnished lunch came about as the result of orders from “the faceless bosses” upstairs after I wandered in on my own while we secretly filmed from across the street - then security swarmed, all the doors were locked and crowds gathered outside. I must say Jo; it felt like RBS had something terrible to hide. But more of that in a minute.
Neither was I there for publicity, although you could be forgiven for thinking that; for many years I have earned my money (and paid my taxes) by showing off. If I needed negative publicity (and, believe me, that’s all talking publicly about inequality can ever get you) I could get it by using the “N word” on telly, or putting a cat in a bin, or having a romantic liaison with the lad from TOWIE.
I was there with filmmaker Michael Winterbottom making a documentary about how the economic crises caused by the banking industry (RBS were found guilty of rigging Libor and the foreign exchange) has led to an economic attack on the most vulnerable people in society. I don’t want to undermine your personal inconvenience Jo, I’d be the first to admit that I’m often more vexed by little things; iPhone chargers continually changing makes me as angry as apartheid - so I can’t claim any personal moral high ground, but a chance to make a film that highlights how £80bn of austerity cuts were made, punishing society’s most vulnerable during the same period that bankers awarded themselves £81bn in bonuses was irresistible.
The mob upstairs at RBS who exiled you with your rapidly deteriorating lunch have had £4bn in bonuses since the crash. Do they deserve our money more than Britain’s disabled? Or Britain’s students who are now charged to learn? Is that fair?
They were some of the questions I was hoping to ask your boss – but we got no joy through the “proper channels” so we decided to just show up.
Not just to RBS, but also to Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays. I know that the regular folk on the floor aren’t guilty of this trick against ordinary people; they’re like anyone, trying to make ends meet. As you point out though, it’s hard to get to the men at the top so we were forced into door-stopping and inadvertent lunch spoiling. The good news is that this film and even this correspondence will reach hundreds of thousands of people and they’ll learn how they’re being conned by the financial industry and turned against one another - that’s got to be a good thing, even if it makes me look a bit of a twit in the process and the national dish of Spain is eaten sub-par.
Now I’ll be the first to admit your lunch has been an unwitting casualty in this well-intentioned quest but I couldn’t resist the opportunity to ask new RBS boss Ross McEwan if he thinks it’s right that he got a £3.2m “golden hello” when the RBS is sellotaped together with money that comes from everyone else’s taxes. I wonder what he would’ve said? Or whether it’s right that Fred “the shred” (he shredded evidence of impropriety) Goodwin gets to keep his £320k a year pension while disabled people have had their independent living fund scrapped.
And it’s not just RBS mate. Lloyds, Barclays, Citibank and HSBC have all been found guilty of market rigging and not one banker has been jailed.
Trillions of public money lost and stolen and no one prosecuted. Remember in the riots when disaffected youth nicked the odd bottle of water or a stray pair of trainers? Criminal, I agree. 1800 years worth of sentences were meted out in special courts, to make an example. Some crime doesn’t pay, but some crime definitely does. My school mate Leigh Pickett, a fireman is being told that he and his colleagues won’t be able to collect their pension until five years later than agreed, five more years of backbreaking, flame engulfed labour – why? Because of austerity. 
Put simply Jo, the banks took the money, the people paid the price.
I was there to ask a few questions to the guilty parties, now I know that’s not you, you’re just a bloke trying to make a crust and evidently you like that crust warm - but again, it wasn’t me who locked the RBS, I just asked a few difficult questions and the place went nuts. The people that have inconvenienced homeowners, pensioners, the disabled and ordinary working Brits are the same ones who inconvenienced you that lunchtime. They’ve got a lot to hide, so they locked the doors. You said my “agro demeanor” reminded you of school. Your letter reminded me of school too, when the teacher would say, “because Russell’s been naughty, the whole class has to stay behind”.
I’d never knowingly keep a workingman from his dinner, it’s unacceptable and I do owe you an apology for being lairy.
So Jo, get in touch, I owe you an apology and I’d like to take you for a hot paella to make up for the one that went cold – though you could say that was actually the fault of the shady shysters who nicked the wedge and locked you out, I’d rather err on the side of caution. When I make a mistake I like to apolgise and put it right. Hopefully your bosses will do the same to the people of Britain.",0,1418841350,null,0,1418923653,0,cmxs3ip,t3_2pkqos,t1_cmxs3ip,t3_2pkqos,null,1425351584,8,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,8

Gerrard's set to get his 3rd start in 7 days at 34 years old and clearly not able to maintain the right level over 3 games in this short a time period (as proven fucking time an again this season, especially when Downing of all people ran riot on him).  Why the hell is this happening while Can sits on the bench?

Sterling shouldn't be anywhere near the pitch for this game.  The poor guy is going to get burned to the ground.  We need to protect him a little bit and this game is nowhere near important enough to take an unnecessary risk on him.

Can still can't get into the lineup either, which is just absurd.  He's looked quite good in his few appearances so far this season and based on those performances should definitely be starting a match like this.

How the fuck does Borini still not manage to find the pitch when we have only 2 fit forwards?  At least he's on the bench, but I seriously doubt he'll come on as a sub either.

Would we not be better off exercising a little caution and allowing people to earn a bit more before we so rapaciously strip their benefits away?

Well it's on it's second season so it made it that far at least.

I watched a couple of episodes before I'd ever heard of Gogglebox (I'm Canadian) and then after I heard it was based on the UK show I checked out the original. I watch a lot of TV from the UK so I was equally as familiar with the shows the people are watching on both.

I'd say they're pretty much exactly the same. The US version has three older female friends who match up with the older man/woman on the UK version (can't remember any names, sorry), three young hip gay guys who match up with the two young hip gay guys, a family (mom/dad/two brothers) who seem to be like the family with the guy that went on to be on Big Brother (George?) but not nearly as entertaining, two female best friends (one of whom is a lesbian) who match up with the two black women who eat a lot of takeout.

Basically they just took all the same archetypes and recast them and get them to watch US shows. I've always seen it as thinly veiled advertising for the shows they're watching (both TPC and Gogglebox) so it's not like they're breaking new ground.

All that said people in Canada/US tend to watch TV in a different way than people in the UK (fewer ""must see"" shows, events, miniseries to talk about, etc) so if it gets cancelled it won't be because of the people, it will be because people just don't care what strangers think about various TV shows over here.",0,1418842469,null,0,false,0,cmxsqkk,t3_2pgva1,t1_cmxsqkk,t1_cmxg4si,null,1425351284,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

Qatar's slave-driven economy aside for a moment (which in of itself is a whole discussion). This is honestly the only way for clubs to advance into championship status in this day and age. Think about it. Prior to the Abramovich era at Chelsea, they were not that much different from us. A mid-table team that performed reasonably well. 

You think City &amp; Chelsea obtained Premier League titles due to hard working players? Yes, but the only reason those players were there is because they suddenly had the ability to ask their prospects ""How many zero's would you like on the end of your paycheck?""

Suppose there are protests to keep the Qatari's out because we don't want ""dirty money"" infiltrating our club. Do you really think the numerous Sheikhs &amp; Princes of Qatar are going to say ""Wow...the fans of Tottenham Hotspur have really opened our eyes, we should reform our economy to not be so slave driven"". They're gonna keep killing off illegal migrant workers in their country whether they invest in our club or not.

At that point, we've turned away a billion pound investment AND the country is still doing the thing we don't want them to do.

- women often choose fields of study, such as sociology, liberal arts or psychology, that pay less in the labor market.

- Nearly all the most dangerous occupations, such as loggers or iron workers, are majority male and 92% of work-related deaths in 2012 were to men. Dangerous jobs tend to pay higher salaries to attract workers.


Does a  gap take into consideration doing the same jobs, while working the same hours, with the same level of risk, with the same educational background and the same years of continuous, uninterrupted work experience, and assuming no gender differences in family roles like child care?

Actually, if you interpret what I said that way, you should be calling me a hypocrite - I'm complaining about people giving other people special considerations while, in effect, demanding special considerations for Aspies. Except that really isn't the intent.

&gt; You can't make a rule for ""all chinese people"", because they aren't all the same.

Yes, I didn't get into that, but I'm aware. It's like [youcanfeelme](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2pkrm4/is_the_london_based_media_confused_about_racist/cmxo1yw?context=3) - OK, that comment I just linked is just trolling, but the first comment could be interpreted as being offensive only in order to make a valid point.

I say ""Aspie"" isn't an offensive term, I use the word myself at times, and I've been in groups with other people with Aspergers all using it. In fact ""Aspie"" seems to have been in use before Aspergers was well known, and possibly was coined by people with Aspergers. I'm also aware that some people with Aspergers think the word is offensive and should never be used, and I have sympathy with that too, but I still think it's a mistake.

So we Aspies aren't all the same either. But when talking to someone you don't know, how are you supposed to know what ""treating them as an individual"" means except as a inferences based on their superficial characteristics? Any non-superficial inference is impossible due to not knowing anything non-superficial about the person.

It's a kind of trap - forcing people into doing the best they can with only superficial clues, then potentially condemning them for doing so.

Collectively and individually, it's fair to assume that people with Aspergers are hypocrites, myself absolutely included - social psychology tells us that everyone is a hypocrite. But as I was originally only using Aspergers as a relevant analogy that I'm familiar with, I don't think I'm being hypocritical here.

Actually, another thing I often say is a quote from the South Park guys who aren't exactly known for being inoffensive - ""if any of it's OK it's all OK"". And as it happens I love social incompetence humour, probably more than most people *because* I identify with it. I sometimes use the pervasiveness of certain social-incompetence memes and stereotypes to make a point, but I wouldn't be so familiar with them if I wasn't going out of my way to expose myself to them.

The real underlying problem, for me, is that when it comes to prejudice people are too keen on starting witch hunts and lynch mobs over superficial political-correctness taboos. It doesn't change anything for the better - it's a distraction, allowing the underlying attitudes to continue unchecked. *In addition* I think it's also a form of bullying and indirect discrimination in itself, but irrespective of that, I think real change can't happen *without* upsetting people, including victims of prejudice and discrimination who are now somewhat dependent on whatever adaptations they've had to make.

So I think it's important to argue against the witch-hunts and superficial taboos.

I see what you mean, but I don't think re-appropriating words is the way to change social norms. There's obviously a huge amount of practical changes that need to be made in order to challenge prejudice, language is only one aspect of it - but when it comes to language, I think people need to first realise that a certain word is insulting, then stop using it, them challenge others who use it. 

To take another example: my dad has a cornershop, in a working class majority white area - but he's been established in the same area for more than 20 years and the locals know him by name - and when anyone (usually an outsider) calls his place 'a paki shop' they'll get an earful from his loyal customers, even though he doesn't mind the term. 

I think this is what needs to happen - people challenge people's prejudices and (unknowing or knowingly) prejudiced language. Maybe at some point we will stop unnecessarily pointing out people's differences then unless it's relevant, and then only with language that isn't loaded.

Chelsea at the time had a fairly weak team. At Chelsea Mata (fan player of the year) was the only big signing AVB got.

The season after he got sacked they signed Hazard, Oscar, and Azpilicueta (one of the best left-backs in the world, along with Premier Leagues best attacking midfielder, followed by the best Brazilian currently playing in the league). If AVB got similar additions at Spurs, I am certain we would be above 4th too.

Mourinho finished 3rd with this crew.  

Then Mourinho goes on to add Fabergas (maybe the best midfielder to play in the league since Scholes), Courtois (2nd best goalie in the world), Luis (Back up left-back at the price of 16 m. GBP), Remy as a back up striker, and lastly, Drogba as a fun reunion.

Chelsea, on the other hand, I straight loathe.  Everything about the club is repulsive to me, including and especially their glory hunting fans who care nothing about how their club achieves success so long as success is achieved.  I would hope that Spurs fans are better than that.  

Arsenal is a club with two billionaire owners.  Because of Silent Stan's indifference towards football and club matters other than profitability, some fans have called in the past for Usmanov to take over.  I'll tell you what, I will take the legitimate businessman who's only in it for money and doesn't invest anything over a shady gangster who wants to pump petro-dollars into the squad any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

The reason he doesn't get asked those questions is because he wouldn't answer them. Any answer he gives will be spun in whatever way the papers want (essentially whichever way will sell the most papers, and that's usually by implying he said something negative, which he usually didn't). The manager's job, just as much as results on the pitch, is keeping the players together as a squad. He won't do that by making divisive comments about individual players and why they are or aren't in the team. No doubt he has chats with the players at training every week before matches and tells them what they need to do. He doesn't need to publicise that.

He answers questions regarding injuries, contracts (when it's fair to) and the like. No need to say anything that will be twisted disproportionately though. ",0,1418847322,null,0,false,0,cmxvjfj,t3_2pltx2,t1_cmxvjfj,t3_2pltx2,null,1425349940,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

They want to send fewer men and women to prison overall.  That has no bearing on whether they want to treat men and women differently when it comes to sentencing, and send relatively fewer women to prison than men, which they categorically do.

&gt;It's an aim, not a policy. It's very, very long term.

It's a policy.  They numbered it and put it in their policy document.

&gt;Why?

E.g. their policy on reducing the military reasons that we can just make it bigger again at will if someone attacks us.

To add another, Yorkshire pudding with thick onion gravy, served as an appetiser before a roast.

Edit: there's also a slice of Melton Mowbray pork pie with Branston pickle, a hunk of mature cheddar cheese and a pickled onion

Edit2: For an old time Blackcountry (specifically Walsall and I haven't seen them in ages therefore old time) comfort food, strip sarnies. Cut an onion in halves them slice them, separate the slices into strips, slice up some cucumber, put both into a shallowish dish and cover with vinegar, leave at least overnight for full effect, then make a sandwich. Refreshing and fills a hole at the same time, glorious in summer heat and great as a supper.
You can also just keep adding strips, cucumber and vinegar as it keeps very well.

Have you read the report it was based on? Do you disagree with it's findings?

&gt; It's a policy. They numbered it and put it in their policy document.

And yet it is under 'Aims' not 'Policies'. I'll let them know they put it under the wrong subheading.

&gt; E.g. their policy on reducing the military reasons that we can just make it bigger again at will if someone attacks us. Bit stupid since it obviously takes a considerable amount of time to develop military capability. I mean if you want to reduce it then fine, I'm sure there are reasonable arguments for doing so, but they talk about that stuff like it runs on magical hippy dust.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Thanks for the perspective. For the record, I was thinking more in comparison to basketball, in which the teams have slightly less players than a soccer squad and is (only somewhat) similarly fluid. In basketball, though, and all other major American sports except baseball, players can be subbed on and off, so it's more about who gets the minutes than who starts.

I think it's entirely fair from the perspective of the team that Rodgers doesn't answer those questions. I'm just surprised that he doesn't seem to be asked them.

Then again, most American sports have somewhat ridiculous rules in place to make sure the coaches/managers have to speak with the media, presumably to give some semblance of access or something to the fans. The leagues require some amount of post game press conference and also generally require some amount of sideline, in-game questioning, which is absolutely ridiculous and generally treated as such by a lot of the coaches (see Greg Popovich, almost definitely the best American basketball coach if not the best American coach in sports).",0,1418848398,null,0,false,0,cmxw5pn,t3_2pltx2,t1_cmxw5pn,t1_cmxvjfj,null,1425349651,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I'd say that unless intent is clear, that's wrong - they're allowed to object and challenge, not necessarily to be angry and condemn. And the person being challenged has the same right to be hurt, and to object and challenge that.

If someone is allowed to be angry and to attack over a misinterpretation, what you're basically saying is that different rules apply to each person and one (and only one) is guilty (on circumstantial evidence) until proven innocent.

The options in a conflict aren't *only* to be passive or aggressive. The third option is called assertiveness. Obviously it's a tall order to expect people who are consistently treated badly to handle that perfectly all the time, but that doesn't mean handling it badly is the ideal - and besides, that applies to me too.

On the ""reclaiming"" point, I understand that, but for me it just doesn't have that meaning. I used the word ""Aspie"" for years before I even realised some people with Aspergers object to it. I was aware of some people using it offensively, but some people use the term ""people"" offensively. IOW it's to me exactly the same as my perception of ""chinky"", except it relates to a group I'm part of.

That's their policy site.  Highlights:

&gt;PD202 ""Defence"" is the protection of homeland against attack and does not justify pre-emptive strikes against nations and organisations. Military intervention for peacekeeping or conflict prevention cannot be justified unilaterally. It is irrational and immoral to continue activities that exacerbate threats to international and local security.

&gt;PD205 Nuclear weapons are political weapons of terror, and are disproportionate to any threat. Further, since there is a finite possibility that the policy of nuclear deterrence will fail, and the ecological and social consequences of such a failure would be catastrophic, the deterrence system must be abandoned. The Green Party is committed to pursuing immediate and unconditional nuclear disarmament.

&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

false,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"&gt; As someone who doesn't drive... what's the issue with this?

There are situations where you need to be able to accelerate out of trouble.  For instance, you may be travelling at 70mph on a dual carriageway with a HGV pulling across into your lane.  That HGV driver hasn't seen you, so you have the option of accelerating the 10 feet beyond his cab, or braking and hopefully ending up behind him before he swipes you.  Another example; sometimes, you have to accelerate beyond 70mph to safely join a motorway from the slip road.

But there are other situations where a speed limited car can be an issue.  It would kill the track day industry.  It would also cause major problems with cross-border traffic, including from the Isle of Man, where many roads have no speed limit whatsoever.

It's just a bad idea.  Most accidents are caused by people who ""failed to look"".  Illegal speeding on motorways is a non-issue.  And 70mph is an arbitrary number that's long since passed it's sell-by date.  Motorway speed limits should be harmonised with other European nations.",0,1418849541,null,0,false,0,cmxwtpw,t3_2plcqk,t1_cmxwtpw,t1_cmxutxn,null,1425349294,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Kill the Moon really explains it all. The lack of commercial uses for the Moon seemed to have been a major problem in motivation for the world. There could be lots of people who want to do science, but there's often no short-term profit found in basic science, so I can imagine funding sources drying up pretty quickly when they found the Moon wasn't a place where they could set up useful mines.

If you need a hip replacement (for example) you will find a way to pay for that. Which means you can't ""vote with your money"". Sure you can look for people who have a cheaper price, but there's no upper limit. You get stuck with a runaway pricing scheme and end up with what's happened in the US.

The NHS as a centralized system gets to say ""you, you and you are the official providers of fake hips this year"". When you go to get fake hips, those official providers are the ones who win. So it's now much more worthwhile for them to keep prices low, such that they can win the NHS bids.

At least, that's the theory.

A centralized system is what also declares things to be at an ""acceptable"" standard.

Plus, as far as I'm aware, we still believe basic (emergency) medical care is a human right. While that's the case, it will always remain tax based. If that changes, then maybe the system will change with that.

I've gotta tell you, 'making yourself credible' is a completely imaginary target. You probably have a mental list of things Labour could do to 'make themselves credible', wihc I'm sure is great, except that everyone else also has an equally long and totally mutually exclusive list. I spoke to someone the other day who thought that Labour could only 'make themselves credible' if they promised to nationalise rail and all the utilities. This is not something that would make Labour look 'credible' to an enormous number of people - perhaps the majority - perhaps only swing voters.

&gt;I also do not agree with this ridiculous left wing thought process of immigrant's culture being somehow equal or even superior to British culture. Labour needs to get to grips with the reality of British culture being an absolute in the country and immigrants needing to assimilate to Britain rather than Britain assimilating to immigrants.

No-one who can think straight thinks that some cultures are superior to others. All cultures simply are. I suspect that much of what you think of as 'an absolute' of British culture is a) very recent, b) indistinguishable from other cultures, c) not agreed upon by many other people or d) so vague as to be meaningless.

Instead we get the Andros ""Hits everything but the fucking net"" Townsend Show.

Edit: **I'll defend my point because I'm not retracting it.** As I have pointed out in another comment I agree Townsend has had a ""good"" match. The thing is a couple of well placed passes in place of hitting the crown or defence and he might have had another couple of assists which makes a ""great/excellent/exceptional"" performance.

Three assists in a game says **""I'm playing for the team, I want to start, and I can make things happen.""**

One assist and several crowd thumping shots instead of making key passes says **""I'm in this for me, and on another day where we are only 1-0 I am a potential liability.""**

All said and done he is a Spurs player and I want him to do well, I want him to succeed and flourish, but through his own decisions and tunnel vision play he continually undermines himself and that is frustrating and depressing.

Nonetheless, the cap *implies* lots of cuts and Labour voted for it.

1. [Labour have said that all current cuts will stand,](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.co.uk%2F2013%2F06%2F21%2Flabour-spending-cuts-hars_n_3480442.html) including, presumably, those they voted against.

1.

Labour had been trailing the idea of cutting or eliminating Winter Fuel Allowance for the wealthy and Osbourne announced that he wanted to cut it for expats living in places where they didn't need it. Did this actually happen? No fucking clue. This gives you some idea of the state of political reportage in the UK: What politicians say is more important than what happens.

Ultimately, Labour's position is best summed up by Ed Balls, [here](http://labourlist.org/2014/12/balls-tells-bbc-there-will-have-to-be-cuts-but-we-will-make-different-choices/). Basically, Labour supports cuts but not *those* cuts. This isn't actually an inconsistent position: Labour cannot support cuts now because the circumstances that are creating the problem ('low-paid jobs [and] stagnating wages') are not being addressed so cutting now is making the problem worse.

So, your reply to your friend could be something like: 'Labour support cuts in principle, as they have shown by voting for the cap on welfare spending, refusing to repeal the cuts that have been implemented and [maybe] supporting means testing for the Winter Fuel Allowance. *But* as long as the Coalition is failing the poorest and presiding over nonexistent wage growth and widespread precarious employment, it's wrong to support cuts that will hit people suffering from the current Government's economic mismanagement.'",0,1418852500,null,0,1418856177,0,cmxykg5,t3_2pk7si,t1_cmxykg5,t3_2pk7si,null,1425348411,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3

Brad Jones (5): Should have done better for the goal. Was a statue for a couple of shots. Migs on his way back

Kolo (7): Defence looks so much better with him at the book. Communicates with the rest of the back 3/4

Skirtel (6): Solid but still looks vulnerable

Lovren (5): Off at half-time with an injury (?). Simply not good enough.

Lucas (6): Did a good job defensively

Gerrard (6): At the heart of the game going forward but when defending looks slow and ineffective. Should have come off sooner

Henderson (4): Should not be playing on the right or the left. First touch is appalling and gave the ball away far too much. Assist was the only positive point but not enough to forgive the many errors.

Llalana (8): Composed on the ball, a nice assist and almost a highlight reel flick that should have netted Sterling his hattrick. Needs to start

Couts (7): Excellent first half but faded in the 2nd.

Markovic (8/9): How could I forget him. A great finish. Looks fast, creative and exciting.

Sterling (9): Two goals and should have been a hattrick. After the United performance this will provide some much needed confidence but 90 minutes....really BR??

Sakho (8): Came on at half time and looked solid. Played a couple of lovely midfield-splitting passes to start attacks. Glad he's back.

Can (-): Er.....he'll get there

No country is going to try anything if we still have nuclear weapons anyway.

C) VDV is slow as hell, he's not your typical counterattacking player, and we had other players who could play his role when he was sold. There were hints in the media (whether you believe them or not) that AVB didn't want VDV. Our counterattacks never revolved around VDV really so it's not an important issue, we certainly lost creativity when he left but not our ability to counterattack.

If AVB wanted to replace Bale with a player who could counter-attack he could have, there was plenty of stuff from that journalist who was close to AVB saying he got the signings he wanted, if he stops playing counter-attacking football it's because he didn't want to or wasn't able to coach a team to play that way.

Your post actually made me have to remember my username and password, which took ages as I never comment, so congratulations ;)

For Computer Science, it really depends on the institution you attend. A decent University will pay for itself many times over, so the cost is irrelevant. Indeed, as the cost you've quoted in the UK and Spain is the same order of magnitude (only double the price), I would personally remove it from your decision.

As I see it you probably have three advantages to doing a CS degree in the UK:

   * There are probably more first-tier institutions in the UK than Spain (unsubstantiated - based upon the only tier-1 Spanish CS uni I can think of being Barcelona), giving you a better chance of getting a place.
   * Spending 4 years in the UK will turn ""good"" English into ""flawless"" English, which is essential in CS.
   * The UK is a breeding ground for startups and tech companies, giving more options for work placement years (something I could not recommend enough, by the way!)

A little about the student loan system. The loan system here is underwritten by the Government. You have to pay back 9% of your monthly earnings over a set limit, which I believe it currently £24,000 (someone will surely correct me if I'm wrong; it tends to be the median salary in the country. Mine was £21,000 because I'm old). Think of it like a graduate tax. If you can't afford it, you don't get it taken off you - simple as that.

It's not real debt. Noone's ever going to come around your house trying to get it back (unless you bugger off abroad and refuse to cough up!)

Again, I'd highly recommend a work placement year. It gives you a year to understand how things work in industry - it lets you put a lot of what you learned at Uni into context, and can fast-track you into a job later.

I went to York, doing their 5 year masters with placement and I recommend it!

Because you're conflating displacement with engine size. The large pushrod engines popular with GM and other American companies are smaller and lighter than an equivalent displacement DOHC engine. 

The US does not tax engines based on displacement, nor do insurance companies charge higher rates based on displacement, so there's no real incentive to minimize displacement instead of simply minimizing emissions and maximizing efficiency.

Davies (s.4), ""The Impossible Planet"", ""The Satan Pit"" written by Matt Jones. The point being is that Moffat is the ""Showrunner"" and he is responsible for pushing the show in a certain direction, presumably, in a way that is not a slap in the face to anyone who has watched the series since 1963. Where are the stories with that are driven by a sense of adventure and wonder? Stories about civilizations on strange planets where Earth is merely a small part of a greater Universe? There are shows that offer dramatic conflict between two or more characters and they are called soap operas. It seems that Doctor Who is becoming a soap opera. Sad.

If you serve it properly what happens is the chemicals evaporate leaving no trace, something Heston Blumenthal has used during his meals at his restaurant.

What's happened here is either she was served by someone with inappropriate training and safety measures in place, or she was served by someone who was fully trained, had safety measures in place, and this was essentially a total accident.

If it's the latter then as far as I'm aware the individuals can't be prosecuted under health and safety laws as they require you to take ""all practicable"" precautions. If you can prove the individual knew the risks, and all reasonable precautions were taken then nothing is wrong.

However, if it can be proved that the barman lacked training, that they didn't take many precautions, or that the girl didn't know the risks involved, they are potentially facing criminal charges.

So yes, it is legal to serve that drink, and so it should be, what is illegal is serving it in such a manner that it needlessly puts people at more risk than necessary (and that they are aware of). 

For example, fugu (pufferfish) can be poisonous if served incorrectly, and that's legal to serve. I mean fuck, chicken can potentially kill you if it's not cooked properly.

What distinguishes my objection to a big money acquisition of this sort lies in a sense of deep-rooted conservatism regarding football. My truest of affections and loyalty for this club are not accentuated or prolonged by success, and are instead enabled through the club's very nature. If Spurs sink to League 2 in three years, I too will sink, both in support and spirit, though with impenetrable pride and the crest tattooed on my thigh as sufficient accompaniment. Because of course, with victory comes great pleasure and failure brings distress, as a fan wishing nothing more than for Tottenham to dramatically and hastily ascend the tables of England and Europe. Recently, our performances have rendered us as a club consistently in the mix for Champions and Europa League qualification, a precipice objectively characterizable as an overwhelming comparative success when viewing our historical performances in the Premiership and more datedly, the First Division. This success, however, has been neither instant nor the child of the exorbitant spending we witness annually in our neighbors of London, Manchester, and Liverpool, but has instead been gradual and humble, developing players and often accruing a transfer window surplus. For me, this style of success possesses therein a palpable satisfaction in that we have adequately earned our triumphs. I do not regard the fans of our rivals with any attitude of moral disdain, just an acknowledgement that while they appear content to instantly win through unlimited purchase and monetary superiority, I am content to trudge along through the mid-table with players who treasure badge. 

If bought, Spurs will ironically sacrifice so much of what makes us distinct, namely identity, intrigue, and integrity. It is for this that I oppose a shift in ownership wholeheartedly, and Qatar's ethically compromising practices only solidify this position.

The facts:

* There are 21 positions listed from 11 big companies

* The figures suggest **experience** and perhaps personal negotiations play a much bigger role than gender. Let's call the positions in which a gender is getting a lower median salary despite having the higher average experience  ""inequality"" towards said gender.

* In 9 of these positions women's median income was higher than men's and in all but 2 of these women had a higher average years of experience. 2 out of 9 is 22% **""inequality"" towards men**.

* In the remaining 12 men had higher median salaries but 9 of these men also had longer experience on the job. So that's 3 of the 12 positions with **""inequality"" towards women** or 25%
 
* There were 420 reports from women versus 3254 from men so the women make up about 11% of the whole report. Were the number of reports from women on par with that of the men the statistical robustness would be much better and I wouldn't be surprised if the 25% ""inequality"" against women versus the 22% against men disappeared completely.

Despite the pictures taken by the cunt who issued the ticket they still refused to cancel the PCN as they clearly have a tiny A4 sign strapped to a pole several metres away indicating that it is pay and display.

You have no chance in hell of contesting this as they can do whatever the fuck they like due to their shity signs being in place, it is not worth your time or money to try and contest it any further than an appeal.

&gt;I understand that you are contesting the Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) because you state that you were not aware you had parked within a Pay &amp; Display bay as another driver had parked over the lines separating the motorcycle bay and Pay &amp; Display bay at this location, but I have decided to enforce the Notice.
 
&gt;I wish to advise you that I have examined the Civil Enforcement Officer's notes, made at the time of the contravention, and they state that the vehicle had been parked in close proximity to a time plate stating the following restrictions: ""Pay at machine display ticket/pay by phone, Monday to Friday 8:30am - 6:30pm, Saturday 8:30am – 1:30pm.""
                                        
&gt;The notes also state that no valid documentation had been displayed within the vehicle to allow parking at this location, and no parking time had been purchased for the above vehicle registration number. Given that the display of a ticket/purchase of a cashless parking session is one of the conditions of parking in a Pay and Display bay, I am satisfied that a contravention occurred. I have attached photographs taken at the time of the contravention for your perusal.
                                              
&gt;I note you have contested this charge as you state that you were not aware you had parked within a Pay &amp; Display bay as another driver had parked over the lines separating the motorcycle bay and Pay &amp; Display bay at this location, and it made the area appear to be one large motorcycle bay. Whilst I have noted your comments, I must inform you that the grounds you have provided are not sufficient to warrant the cancellation of this charge.
 
&gt;In this case, I can advise you that the issuing Officer noted that your vehicle was parked below a time plate stipulating that the bay you parked in was reserved for vehicle's displaying a valid Pay &amp; Display ticket or active cashless parking session. I should point out that it is the responsibility of the driver to check any location in which they park for such time plates and I am satisfied that the Council did everything within its power to make the restrictions clear to the motorist.

This is a very strange clip to choose in order to explain why you are against the takeover. The first 4 minutes of the video bear little resemblance to the remaining 3 minutes or so. They are very Russia-centric and the statements made therein are sensationalist and extremely polarising (who would expect that from a channel owned by Rupert Murdoch...?!)... So much so, that as an impartial viewer you're almost led to sympathise with the unfortunate billionaire oligarch who has been cruelly oppressed by Putin... waa waa boohoo - apply sarcasm appropriately here in proportion to your views on Chelsea (yes I am aware that there was a genuine threat to Abramovitch's life so don't think that I'm just being callous for the sake of it, at the very least there's some artistic merit). 

HOWEVER, Matthew Syed's argument that football's cultural significance should not be used for political ends is extremely eloquently set out (eventually). The phrase that sealed it for me was:

""Exploiting the cultural significance of football""

And that's just it... 

Whether you happen to be a Russian oligarch and you're protecting your own life from a vicious (eg. Litvanenko) and increasingly unpredictable (eg Chrimea) despotic ruler who happens to disagree with how your wealth stems from the mineral distribution that arose from Yeltsin's post-soviet policies... 

...Or whether you're a sovereign state that happens to be very wealthy but, is ultimately, a minor geopolitical player hoping to insulate and shield yourself from the bipolar shitstorm that is what has become of the Middle East...

AVB didn't play Sturridge as a striker he played him out wide, so he's clearly not the kind of striker he was looking for.

Whilst I agree that Ade probably wasn't his choice as Ade arrived before AVB, Soldado almost certainly was his choice as he arrived after AVB. According to the Jason Burt (AVB's English mouthpiece) article when AVB was sacked, he signed off on Capoue, Soldado and Paulinho at a minimum.

C) This is true but if you don't have any urgency in moving the ball forward in a counter attack it ceases to be a counterattack. VDV may have played a role in these counterattacks but he didn't make them counterattacks, he didn't get the ball from one end to the other.

Coutinho, first I've heard of that lol. You sure you don't mean Moutinho? If so, he's apparently quite shit for Portugal and Monaco nowadays. If a manager soley relies on having one player you've got to say they're pretty fucking rigid and that's not a good attribute for a manager to have.

I'm not going to dispute whether his Porto team played nice stuff or not, I don't know enough about them (though I do know that Hulk and Guarin are not similar players to Soldado and Ade and don't play the same position as them).

border controls are fine and dandy, but we're not in a cultural/economic place to implement them, nor would it necessarily be a good thing for Britain (discouraging enterprising people to move here etc..)

Davies is more conservative, but his crossing is much better, and you get the feeling he picks and chooses his moments to attack, instead of just bombing forward constantly.

Bollocks.

Nobody votes for a party they know little about regardless of policies. Publicity is key for winning votes, and at the moment the Greens have very little.

Why do you think UKIP took such a big jump after being given the same broadcast rights as the main parties? Or how the BNP membership spiked following Nick Griffin's appearance on question time? People hear about what they have to say and that provides an opportunity for people to agree/disagree. Even if the majority don't agree, the party will still gain support from those that do.

Not to mention public scrutiny can lead to policy ideas changing; do you think UKIP have the same policies now as they did 5 years ago? (Aside from the obvious one or two). No, and it only takes one look at their last election manifesto to know this.

The Audi website also gives the higher figure. Wish they'd break it down into the different engine modes.

Does 60 mpg just mean the 1.4 engine?

If you drop your starting quarterback or wide receiver, that's a big fucking deal because your option is (for most teams) generally a much lower rated player.
