And we're a not-for-profit charitable organisation - all the money we make is invested back into the business, which also funds all the campaigns we run to change things for the better.

&gt; How about you fuck off back to the cuntville that you live in and let me be as I am.

Do what you will, but if someone online telling you to grow up bothers you that much, you might have some issues that need to be addressed.

&gt; Or maybe man up and put money where your mouth is cunt.

You're showing your age by using ""man up."" And are you asking me to make a bet? I never said we 100% will or won't make top 4, just that it's a bit premature to go ahead etch the season in stone when we aren't even at the halfway point yet. I think there is /r/charitablebets though, so if it's that important to you, I'm happy to place a friendly wager on it.

&gt; Top 4 finish and I'll gladly apologise.
I expect you to do the same.

And what exactly should either of us apologize about? I said we have a realistic chance to make top 4; you said we don't. Is it normal for people to apologize for being wrong about a speculative opinion?

&gt; Aren't you the same asshole who said this? And now you act like you know everything and can't accept people with different views. What a hypocrite.

Yes, I did say that. What exactly did I post that contradicted that though? What I do see is that you are fixating on downvotes, getting defensive, and whining.

Stating your opinion as fact (we will not, or we 100% will, etc) isn't conducive to meaningful discussion. I don't mind it and I'm thoroughly entertained by it, but don't be surprised when most people don't respond positively to or engage with that kind of tone and attitude.

All I said was that going on a similar January-May run as 2013 and 2014 is possible, but that we still have a lot of work to do. Nothing in that is black and white. It does seems like you do think you know everything and don't like having those assertions challenged though. Do you have issues with opinions different than yours?

false,lec1ads,null,null,"The Times, Kane is Able, Graeme Souness, 28.12.2014

I like to think that I was one of Bill Nicholson’s few mistakes as manager of Tottenham. Every week, when the team sheet went up, I would be knocking on his door, telling him that I should be in his line-up. I insisted that I was a better player than Martin Peters, a World Cup winner, Alan Mullery, who captained England at the time, and Steve Perryman, who, looking back now, matured quicker than me. I still say to Glenn Hoddle that we would have made some midfield partnership. 
Nobody told me to bide my time, that my chance would come. I eventually moved to Middlesbrough at Christmas 1972 and the rest is history. I only bring it up now because I can relate to the current crop of youngsters coming through at White Hart Lane. It is a fabulous football club, one which is still special to me, but, like all big clubs today, everybody connected with it feels they should be in the Champions League and that makes it hard for a manager to take a chance on kids. 
Let’s be honest, it has been forced on them this season because the signings they made after selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid simply haven’t worked out. Having spent more than £100m on new players, it’s ironic they now have Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason, who have all come through their youth system, becoming so influential. That’s a dream for any football club, to get players that are steeped in it, who love the club and who know everything about it. 
We probably wouldn’t have heard much about Kane and company if Tottenham’s big buys of summer 2013 had worked out. They have tried them in different systems and positions and now they have turned to their kids. Other than that scenario, how else do young players get into the first team? How do they make a breakthrough because the big clubs are always under pressure to buy the finished article? 
I particularly like the look of Kane. He plays with the freedom and infectious enthusiasm of a kid who has not got any price tag on him. He’s going to be an England player for sure. When you look at what’s out there, in a very short period of time he will be knocking on Roy Hodgson’s door. He will certainly be in the Euro 2016 squad if he keeps it going. 
He is already the full package. He has super technique. He’s brave. He tackles defenders back and can play a pass through. He plays with great energy and passion for the game and he has the right physical attributes of size, strength and speed. 
When you see him being interviewed, he’s refreshing to listen to. You can see that he’s delighted to be where he is. If he retains that, he will thrive. Would you ever have to say to him: “Make sure you are bang at it today”? No. 
Kane was on target again on Boxing Day, scoring in the first minute of Tottenham’s 2-1 win at Leicester City. The striker had a loan spell at Leicester last year but has established himself in the first team at White Hart Lane this season. He has already found the net 15 times this season, including a hat-trick in the Europa League and one in each of his past four matches for the club. 
Kane could be a major influence on Tottenham going forward because of his never-say-die attitude. Compare and contrast with Emmanuel Adebayor, whom he has replaced. Adebayor should have been a world-class footballer, but he allowed himself to get in a great big, comfy armchair very early on in his career and he has never got back out of it. If the alternative is somebody bursting to be a success at his club, the only one he’s been at, then, as a manager, there’s no choice to make. 
Roberto Soldado looks a better character than Adebayor in terms of attitude, but he’s a bit of mystery to me, too. 
When Tottenham bought him from Valencia, I thought that he was going to become their fox in the box, somebody who scores all types of goals, but it’s not happened for him. With the amount of goals he got regularly in La Liga — one every two games over nine seasons — I thought that he was a sure-fire bet to do well. 
The big signings have failed and the director of football system just hasn’t worked for Tottenham. They have given as many opportunities as they can to these players — footballers who were brought in for big fees and given huge salaries — and then they have turned to the kids in desperation. 
It’s not just Kane. Bentaleb and Mason have been impressive in midfield, too. Mason is 23, two years older than Kane, and had also been out on loan to various clubs before finally getting his chance. He’s got an eye for a goal, a pass and again, and this is really important for a manager, he comes off the pitch knackered, having given everything. 
Bentaleb’s only 20 and stands a chance of being a top player, too. Of all the North African countries, Algeria seem to consistently produce good footballers. They pushed Germany as hard as anyone did at the World Cup. 
It’s a dream to get players coming all the way through your football club from schoolboys to main men, people who could be there for 10 years, but it’s also unusual. Manchester United, whom Tottenham face at home today, thought they had found the holy grail when they got those five or six through all at once 20 years ago, but they haven’t done it since. 
That’s not about people in academies doing a better or worse job because a lot of it is down to luck. It’s hard to take a kid at 11 or 12 and say that he is going to be the man in 10 years’ time. There are so many imponderables which can go wrong in his development, whether it is an injury, issues at home or that he doesn’t develop physically to handle the highest level and doesn’t become the player you thought and hoped he was going to be. 
There is no formula other than going out and picking the best kids at 12 and hoping and praying that they make it. If there was, United would have done it every couple of years and it’s not happened since the Class of 92.

false,lec1ads,null,null,"The Times, How rising Spurs star Harry Kane became one of their own at the Lane, Rory Smith, 24.12.2014

Rory Smith speaks to coaches who were involved in helping to turn a promising young striker into a fans’ favourite at Tottenham Hotspur

Everyone who encountered Harry Kane on the way up tells a version of the story. None of the managers or coaches who played a role in the Tottenham Hotspur striker’s inexorable rise has a bad word to say about him; they invariably recall the tale with a reflexive fondness. It is likely, though, that they were just a touch more exasperated at the time than they now care to admit.

This is how Chris Hughton tells it, casting his mind back to the injury-curtailed season that the 21-year-old spent under his tutelage at Norwich City, two years past. “He was not a difficult boy to manage at all,” he says, affectionately. “But there came a point where you would have to pull him off the training pitch. He always wanted to train. Finishing, in particular. He wanted to do extra finishing work all the time.

“We would normally have three goalkeepers training with us, and it might be that the two reserves would be the ones involved in shooting drills. Harry would stay out with one of them doing extra finishing. Even when they had gone in, he would still stay out, without a goalkeeper. He didn’t mind, really. He just wanted to train. The thing is that he was always a good finisher anyway.”

Kane spent six months of the previous season at Millwall. The variant of the story that sticks with Kenny Jackett, his manager at the New Den, differs in the details but echoes the same spirit. “The football he was used to playing in the under-21 league for Spurs was of a good technical level,” says Jackett, now in charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers.

“The football in the Championship is much more physical, though, and normally you have to warn young players to watch for the difference. Harry worked it out. He came to me after the first couple of games and told me — not the other way round — that he needed to win more headers, that he had to compete more in the air to get himself in the game. That was what he worked on in training. That and his finishing. He did so much finishing. The coaches would have to tell him he was about to pop his thigh if he didn’t stop.”

Even that would not have worked at Leyton Orient, the first club he joined on loan. Kane was just 18 when he moved to Brisbane Road, one of three Spurs prodigies sent to east London for a taste of competitive football. “I had seen him training before he came here,” says Kevin Nugent, the League One side’s assistant manager.

“He was always doing extra work with the development squad — free kicks and finishing especially. You could see the hunger to do well. It was the same when he was with us, and of course because it was a youth loan, he could still go back to play games with their development squad if he had not been selected for us. With that sort of work ethic, it’s not surprising he’s kicked on.”

Kicked on he has, of course, emerging this season first as a cult hero to Tottenham’s fans — one of their own, as they sing — then, probably more significantly, as the side’s most potent weapon. He has scored 14 goals, despite spending the early weeks and months of the campaign as a substitute, his appearances and exposure carefully rationed by Mauricio Pochettino, the head coach. His target, he says, is 20, surely comfortably realistic. All of that extra training has paid off.

That is the instinctive reaction to Kane’s story and the stories about Kane, of course: that here is a young player who showed the diligence and determination necessary to succeed and is now reaping the richly deserved rewards. There is, though, another interpretation, one that reflects just as well on the player but far less kindly on his parent club.

Kane’s appetite for self-improvement is not the only common thread between the recollections of Hughton, Jackett and Nugent. All three men were, one way or another, close to Spurs, in a position to be tipped off about his progress. Nugent had a good relationship with Joe Jordan and Tim Sherwood, who oversaw Spurs’s development squads and allowed them to watch their young players train; Jackett had forged a bond with the club after taking Andros Townsend on loan a couple of years previously; Hughton, of course, is a Tottenham man through and through.

All three had been advised by contacts and friends that Kane had something; all three were inclined to believe it. What is not clear is whether Spurs saw these loan spells — as well as the time he spent at Leicester City in 2013 — as a crucial part of his development, whether it was part of a painstaking, meticulous plan, or whether the process was more piecemeal than that. Certainly, Kane’s circuitous career path is not exactly typical of a player who has long been earmarked for stardom.

The spate of loans, indeed, is more commonly associated with a prospect who lacks the necessary quality to make it among the elite. Yet he is not the only member of Pochettino’s squad to have a bulging CV: Ryan Mason and Townsend too have been around the houses. All three are held up, now, as the standard-bearers for the Spurs youth system.

If such a claim might seem a little jarring, Nugent insists it should not be. “It is not out of sight, out of mind,” he says, defending Spurs’s approach. “Everything was fed back to Spurs, all the training sessions, all the match data. They were given all of the footage of him playing for us, fully annotated so they could watch every action he performed in every game.”

Jackett and Hughton say similar. “They planned it out,” Jackett insists. “It is part of a process to toughen up the young players, to harden them up, to help them develop after the end of the academy system.

“The Den is a tough crowd to win over. Harry did that. He scrapped and he fought.”

Every step of the way, in fact: Kane’s story is one that is defined by his work ethic, by his desire to get the most out of his talent, by his desire to overcome all the obstacles put in front of him, even if some of those were constructed by the club now benefiting from everything he learnt on his long and winding road.

Long road to the top

Ryan Mason
The 23-year-old midfielder has emerged as a surprise member of the first team this season after time on loan at Yeovil Town, Doncaster Rovers, Millwall, Lorient and Swindon Town.

Andros Townsend
Very much the market leader for time spent on loan, the winger, now an England player, was parked at nine clubs, from Yeovil to QPR.

Danny Rose
Signed from Leeds as a teenager for £1 million, the left back is now an established member of the squad but has spent time at Watford, Peterborough United, Bristol City and Sunderland.

Nabil Bentaleb
The only member of Tottenham’s cadre of young players to have remained at Spurs Lodge ever since joining the club from Mouscron, the Belgian side, in 2012, the Algeria midfielder broke through under Tim Sherwood.

I, like many others when they started out, didn't purchase the top-end gear brands. Infact I went pretty much no-named at first (all except the helmet). I bought all of it online and only from sites that had a dozen or so good, legitimate reviews. My reasoning for this was that I was starting out and wasn't really sure if riding the bike was for me or not. I didn't want to sink oodles of cash into gear only to never use it.

Turns out biking **was** for me so I ended up replacing all of it not 6 months after I started riding with slightly more expensive branded stuff. The old kit was just so flimsy and badly made, I didn't like (or feel terribly safe) using it. The only thing I have kept is my old helmet, which to be honest was a frackin' bargain at £35 (Shox Bullet). My old commute was 5 minutes on country roads - it's now 60 minutes on open dual carriageways. I hate to think what my old jacket would have been like!

At current, I have a pair of boots from some unknown brand that I will be replacing in the new year. 4 months after having them now and they are falling apart and letting water in. Not a disaster as they were only £40.

Long story short, if you are ""testing the water"" so to speak on a CBT or just starting out then get cheap and cheerful. No point going for Shoei, Alpine etc if you don't like riding a few weeks down the line.

Gerrymandering is when you manipulate district boundaries to in effect give a minority voting block a majority of elected representatives (45% of the population having 55% of the representatives). In the new downsized Northern Ireland the Unionists would be the clear majority and would be represnted as such (75% of the population with 75% of the representatives). The Parts of Northern Ireladn secede to the republic would no longer be subject to British rule, so their representation is no longer necessary.  

So unionist only don't want to be a part of a Uninted Ireland cause the British keep winding them up? The fact is the unionist population don't want to be a part of a united Ireland, the reason they don't is irrelevent. People should have the right to self-determintation, where the people that actually live in an area decide on its future.

See for example the Schleswig question:
 [Example of Self-determination of disputed territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig_plebiscites,_1920)

Repartition would in my view solve the issue. The main problem with Northern Ireland form its inception is that it included too many people that didn't want to be part of it. Obviously it would scupper any chance of a 32 country republic as areas such as Antrim are so heavily unionist that there is very slim chance of them ever voting to join a UI. So republicans won't like it.

Though the problem with Northern Ireland is, no matter what you do someone won't like it, (which also then leads to them expressing this with violence). British Unionism and Irish Republicanism are incompatiable ideologies. Therefore we should look at the option based most fairly on democratic self-determination and not on irredentism.",0,1419764912,null,0,false,0,cn7aymk,t3_2qiwxj,t1_cn7aymk,t1_cn6yecr,null,1425183953,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

&gt;

&gt;The __Schleswig plebiscites__ were two [plebiscites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebiscite), organized according to section XII, articles 109 to 114 of the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles) of June 28, 1919, in order to determine the future border between [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) through the former duchy of [Schleswig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig). The process was monitored by a commission with representatives from [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden).

&gt;The plebiscites were held on 10 February and 14 March 1920, and the result was that the larger northern portion (Zone I) voted to join Denmark, while the smaller southern portion (Zone II) voted to remain part of Germany.

2. Henderson - A real team player and future leader. He does all the dirty work, and I can see him staying here the rest of his career. He is a hard working jack of all trades. I have all the time in the world for him.

3. Lazar Markovic - He's still very much in his early days here, but he's got raving reviews from every top scout in the world, and he's just beginning to find himself in our team. He, like Sterling could be an incredible talent in the near future. He reminds me a lot of early Robben.

4. Alberto Moreno - Young and clearly talented. Again he finds himself in a new league, but I strongly believe once he's settled in he will become one of the best attacking fullbacks in the league. He needs to sort out some of his defensive lapses though.

5. Daniel Sturridge - Would be pretty much at the top if it wasn't for my fear his injuries could potentially ruin his career. For this reason I hesitantly put him on here as I think he is world class when he's fit, but he worries me. 

The only big omission is Coutinho, who can be utterly brilliant on his day. For me, he isn't consistent enough, and seems to have all his good days at Home games. I think he has the potential to be insane, but this is a list of 5 players, and he could easily take the place of anyone on 3-5.

About three times more expensive than 'value' pots: ~£1 for 1.8kg from Iceland/Farmfoods.  A 2.5kg bag of 'white' potatoes from Tesco is 44p at the moment.  55.6p/Kg for chips as opposed to 17.6p/Kg for the Tesco ones.

&gt;In other words, their eating habits suck and they're self inflicting this cycle.

I think a lot of it is down to convenience (and possibly laziness).  In my town for example the two Iceland's are either in the city centre or on the old high street and the supermarkets are on the outskirts.  Unless you drive, it's easier to catch the bus to the old high street and get the majority of your shopping from Iceland (who'll helpfully deliver it for you after you've paid) and get the little bits from Asda, Tesco etc than do a big shop at the supermarkets (who'll deliver if ordered online, and have a credit/debit card which not everyone has).

Add to that a lack of cooking skills and/or equipment.

Inzaghi was a pure goalscorer, not much else - although, I haven't seen him play that much, just from what I've read. That's what I was talking about - Italy could produce a striker that's awful technically and still be incredibly successful. If I think about great strikers from Netherlands' youth system they all seem very good technicians.

Borini could've been something like Inzaghi was, I think, if he had stayed in Serie A. That's just my speculation.

 [**Swansea Blitz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea%20Blitz): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Swansea Blitz__ was the [heavy and sustained bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz) of [Swansea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea) by the [Luftwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe) of [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) on 19–21 February 1941. A total of 230 people were killed and more than 400 were injured.

&gt;Swansea was selected as a legitimate target due to its importance as a port and [docks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_Docks) and the oil refinery just beyond and its destruction was key to Nazi German war efforts as part of their [strategic bombing campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II) aimed at crippling coal export and demoralising civilians and emergency services.

&gt;The first air raid on Swansea was early on the morning of 27 June 1940, at 3.30 am. On the last night of the '3 nights blitz', the [air raid sirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren) sounded at 7.50 pm - the start of a raid that lasted for five hours.

You accept that white people use drugs just as much as black people, so the question that Theresa May is asking is ""why are black people ten times more likely to be stopped and searched?"" The police have for quite some time known to be racist. So Theresa May is reforming some of the powers they use to carry out their racist practices.

I don't accept that she's all of a sudden reforming the Police Federation as some sort of election ploy as you seem to be suggesting, given that it's hardly a vote winning policy.

Regarding the Modern Slavery Bill, I didn't say she's campaigning around the country for it. She doesn't need to campaign for a Bill that will likely pass with support from all parties. What I said was that she's launching public awareness campaigns. So you might see television adverts about modern slavery and how you, as a citizen, can help fight it and how to spot the signs. The DWP posters you see on phone booths or buses about benefit fraud might be replaced by posters about modern slavery.

As for your response about the article, I have to ask if you actually watched the clip of May speaking that was right at the top? It outlines all the reasons why she forced it to reform.

That was sort of my point. It's the half wits that are commenting further down the thread you need to aim this at. 

&gt;Women aren't the absolute property of men, would you care to explain the current state of the middle east.

That's a vague question. Most ""regimes"" in the ME are actually nationalist and secular/modern. It's only Saudi and Iran that can be classed as theocracies. In both Saudi and Iran women aren't property.

They may have restricted rights and strict interpretations of personal laws, rights and freedoms but they aren't the property of men. Iran and Saudi also have VERY broad differences in how they perceive the role of women and what actualization they are allowed to take part in.

false,mkernow,null,null,"Given the extreme violence of the period, I can see why repartition was discussed. However I think at this stage, and certainly going forward, it is a non-starter, and not just because of the splodgy demo-geography.

Certainly there will always be extremists, a few present here, who demand nothing less than the ideological utopia of a UI. However the overwhelming majority of Irish Catholics are happy to live within the UK so long as they are treated with respect and equality (and we all know the polling data to prove it). People just want to be allowed to get on with their lives. Obviously the problem with Northern Ireland 1922-1972 was that Irish Catholics were severely discriminated against. NICRA and the SDLP campaigned not for a UI but for social and economic equality within the UK - and after a murderous 30 years detour Sinn Fein has essentially reached the same conclusion. Now that that equality has been achieved, only a few naive and extreme people are seriously interested in constitutional change. We're left to bicker over flags and parading, but the fact that these are such prime issues shows that the constitutional question is settled - the question now is merely how to most comfortably accommodate Irish Catholics within the UK e.g. by not letting the OO march down their street.

Southern Ireland left the UK, not because the Irish are extreme nationalists who demand complete sovereignty for their volk (and the forcible inclusion in that volk of their 'tricked' cousins in the north) but because of the long (and utterly inexcusable) history of discrimination and colonialism over Ireland. Now that those attitudes and power structures are (outside of Larne) completely destroyed, there is for the ordinary man no visceral reason to demand a UI - it would not make the ordinary inhabitants of Ireland any better off. Neither would a repartition, for that matter.

Also, I'd like to say that one can be both fully Irish and fully British - just as one might be fully Welsh and fully British. The false dichotomy between the two is one of the sad legacies of the troubles.

Maxtible and Waterfield were experimenting with static electricity and mirrors in 1866, but is unclear if this would have been successful alone without the Dalek involvement - *Evil of the Daleks*.

Sometime in the second half of the C19th Tobias Philby constructed a working time cabinet - comic *The Amateur*. This may only have worked due to the TARDIS passing by.

In the 1880s or 1890s Thophilus Tolliver, a friend of H G Wells, constructed a working time machine - comic *The Eternal Present*. The Doctor met Wells on several occasions, however, and may have been indirectly responsible for this machine working too.

Sometime in the '70s (or was it the '80s?) Professor Whitaker creates a time travel system capable of bringing Dinosaurs forward and seemingly sending people backward - *Invasion of the Dinosaurs*.

Somewhere in the 2050s Professor Osric creates a mirror-based system which, again seems unable to work without outside assistance - audio *Time of the Daleks*  

In the C22nd Orson Pink was involved in a partially successful time-travel program - *Listen*. Hila Tacorien was also a pioneer time-traveller from around this time, so possibly part of the same program - *Hide*.  

Sometime significantly after C40th, the *Hank Morgan IV* was an experimental Earth timeship - audio *The Anachronauts*.  

The Time Agency seems to have been established in the C49th - Torchwood *Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang*.  

No doubt there are other references too.

EDIT - added the traveller from *Hide* as suggested by /u/Sscary.

It's a non-starter anyway, due to the history of the place. The fact is that nationalists have been forced to accept the unionist majority in the arbitrary borders of NI for the last century. If you think they could get away with inventing a new majority when the old one disappears you're deluded.

There's also a very important point you're ignoring, which is the changing demographics of NI. Maybe if you tried repartition now you'd get away with it, there'd be a lot of deaths but it still might stick, but the more time that passes, the less viable a 'downsized NI' becomes.

That is not whining.

Have you actually seen how many goals we have scored and how many have been scored against us?

To be in the top 4 we need more goals and less conceded.

I am not writing off the team, in fact I am being realistic enough to realize that our chances of finishing top 4 is beyond achievable if we are to look at our current performances this year.

Mind you using statistics from previous years won't help us much because we did not have such a young team in the previous seasons.

Our defenders are still not used to playing together and our striking options with the tactics and formations used have been non existent to say the least.

Our Goal Keepers neither  in form or have the confidence needed to take charge of their area.

Just because its the festive season does not mean that our players will wake up tomorrow morning and automatically start doing this they are meant to do and not make errors that they have been making so far this season.

I am not saying this implies to you or anyone in particular but my assumption is that many fans are still riding the success train from last season and now have forgotten to check the improving performances of the other teams which are also part of the league and aiming for top 4.

As for putting money where your mouth is was meant figuratively and not literally.

Oh and by the way.
There is a difference between highly impossible and completely impossible.


Edit: Hours ago, you had said that it is important for people to raise their views and yet when people do there are many on this sub who happily jump on the downvote train.

&gt;Who gives a fuck what gets down voted or up voted? You say it like its some sort of important factor? Anyone who cares about not wanting to voice their opinion because of whether it will be up voted or down voted shouldn't be here. You're placing too much on the fact things get up voted or down voted.

&gt;The important fact is people voice their opinions. Whether they are wrong, right, whatever - people can agree, disagree and debate. Surely thats the whole point?


How exactly can people voice with opinions when there are unreasonable and unrealistic people on this sub who do not have the ability to accept that people have different views?


Hopefully the way you believe that a finish outside the top 4 is nonsense, you will understand that no everyone is you and there are people like myself who think that a top 4 finish is ""HIGHLY IMPOSSIBLE"" ( different from completely impossible).

Edit: I just realised that you and everyone else that has opposed me could be time travelers and already know that we finished top 4 and I am one of the few to consider our current situation to determine our possible finish towards the end of the season.

Call it anti-Muslim sentiment or something else then if you like, the important thing is to recognise that it exists, and that it manifests itself as prejudice, discrimination, persecution, violence, etc, and is completely different to legitimate, rationale, critique.

We make the difference between the two in order to condem phobist motivations and behaviour while protecting pegitimate critique. In order to differentiate genuine concerns from a variety of angles while condemning themselves with malicious and exploitative intentions. Its hard to distuinguish between the two at times, but there is a huge difference, for example, between secular critique of Islam on the one hand and fearmongering conspiratoral drven counterjihadism on the other.

Absolutely.

The term ""perfectly good"" implies that there is nothing wrong with it, that it's just fine as it is and that nothing needs to change.

We don't expect people to shit in a bucket and then clean it out in the morning (see slopping out cases in Scotland) and we think that's it's unreasonable to send people overseas to be tried in countries where they will face torture (see Abu Qatada).

Those judgements are right, and it's good that we have legislation that upholds those values and protects people.

However there are cases where people who have entered the UK illegally or on false pretences have used Article 8 to attempt to remain in the UK after finding a UK national ""partner"" with a child from a previous relationship unconnected to the applicant.

false,r00x,uk,United Kingdom,"Having used to work at Currys/PC World for some time, I can tell you they have to do a lot of strange things in an effort to 'make more money' on these products.

The principle issue is the margin on high end electricals is vanishingly low. We're sometimes talking maybe £20-50 profit on a TV or a laptop, if that. It's too competitive for them to raise the price any higher, so they are forced to sell all these services and other crap to make up the difference.

The situation in the store was very much one of punishing poor performance instead of rewarding good. I hear it's got better now but it used to be the case that every salesperson, and the store overall, was tracked on various performance metrics with which there were enforced minimum performance criteria to meet. 

It was a flawed system.

The way it worked, it actually caused stores to TURN AWAY BUSINESS because losing the sale was less of a problem than not getting these arbitrary performance numbers. If they hadn't sold many TVs with extras that week, they would rather tell you a TV was out of stock than let you buy it without the HDMI cables, the Blu-Ray player, and their insurance/protection plan, because to do the latter would get them in trouble. 

That's right. They will often try NOT to sell you something if you won't take the extras they want to sell with it. Usually by claiming it's out of stock.

In an area where there were multiple stores, we'd regularly get customers coming in saying ""Currys up the road said you have X of this in stock"" and we know they'd sent them our way in order to avoid selling them product that would hurt their numbers. We'd also be forced to do the same, if our numbers were bad at the time.

Everyone in the store, managers and all, thought it sucked and didn't like it, but the system didn't really give them a choice. It was that, or face repercussions for underperforming.

So to hear that they're now doing this... I'm not surprised, but just know it's not the fault of the people in the store, they hate it as much as you do. But they will probably try hard not to let their product go without these bogus 'services' because they're in trouble if they don't. OP saying they were dropping the price will have been the managers trying to make the sale while being able to claim they also sold the set-up service, because the numbers will only show a +1 sold for that service, not that they sold one at a discount so large it nearly erased any profit it was there to make up.",0,1419773991,null,0,false,0,cn7ckfs,t3_2qjkpl,t1_cn7ckfs,t1_cn6rjyd,null,1425183204,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

The big wins for me however would have been the amalgamation of a travel document and driving licence into just one thing you had to carry, plus the idea that it would have helped fault benefit fraud and immigration fraud - you can't very well turn up at the Job Centre or an Immigration Office claiming to be Person C and a fresh applicant when your fingerprint and facial biometrics positively identify you as the fraudster Person A, deported 3 months ago trying to claim to be Person B.

I'll see if i can dig up the paper, may take a while since I forgot to keep the copy. 

Ok found it. The main stumbling block for it at the moment is the fact that the space required to store the chain does not grow in a linear manner as you add more voters, so if you wanted to use it for a general election you would have to divide up the population quite a bit, but as a proof of concept its definitely there.

&gt;December 28, the equivalent day in Spain and the [Hispanic America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_America), is also the Christian day of celebration of the ""[Day of the Holy Innocents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADa_de_los_Inocentes)"". The Christian celebration is a holiday in its own right, a religious one, but the tradition of pranks is not, though the latter is observed yearly. After somebody plays a joke or a prank on somebody else, the joker usually cries out, in some regions of Ibero-America: *Inocente palomita que te dejaste engañar* (""You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled""). In Mexico, the phrase is *¡Inocente para siempre!* which means ""Innocent forever!"". In Argentina, the prankster says *¡Que la inocencia te valga!*, which roughly translates as a piece of advice on not to be as gullible as the victim of the prank. In Spain, it is common to say just *¡Inocente!* (which in Spanish can mean ""Innocent!"", but also ""Gullible!""). Nevertheless, on the Spanish island of [Minorca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minorca), *Dia d'enganyar* (""Fooling day"") is celebrated on April 1 because Menorca was a British possession during part of the 18th century. In Brazil, the ""Dia da mentira"" (""Day of the lie"") is also celebrated on April 1.

The republic already agreed that the North should decide its own fate ""The principle of consent"". My only question is why maintain the arbitrary boundaries of the North, which we all agree are artificial, when it is obvious when looking at any map of demographics that the the unionist population is overwhelmingly concetrated in the East.

The borders of Northern Ireland may be arbitrary lines but the concept behind them is not. It was to seperate the unionist population who wished to remain part of the UK and to avoid a full scale civl war in Ireland.  I'm not for inventing a new unionist majority, its the same unionist bloc it always has been. I'm for more accurately defining it. When are large concetnartion of people in one area doesn't wish to be a part a politcal system, they should have the right not to be a part of it. Wheather it be the population of the 26 counties that chose to leave the UK, the Basques of Spain or the Danes of Northern Schleswig. Self determiantion is the fairest solution to the legacy of forming nation states out of ethnic groups. Irredentism causes nothing but problems.

Also the downsized Northern Ireland wouldn't be an independent state it would still be the anemic failed state entirely dependent on Britain, as it always was, it would just be smaller, less expensive and have less people who didn't want to live in it.  

If you think a united Ireland with 800,000 unwilling unionists is more workable, it is you that is deluded.

The defence and Lloris did a great job of stopping the triumvirate of Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao, with maybe a couple of hiccups where we got lucky. 

Mason played well in the first half with some excellent movement, he was anonymous in the second half though. Stambouli on the other hand did nothing in the first half, but became more involved as the game went on.

All of the attacking players didn't do much wrong, we just didn't put away the few chances we created.

One thing I noticed with Davies is that he seems to be able to pass it up to one of our midfielders regardless of where he is.

Townsend played both directions really well. Really helped Chiriches in our own third and didn't play a one dimensional attacking game. Looked to bring other men into play and almost had a weak foot strike go in. 

Speaking of Chiriches: he did well to not get caught out too much. We saw him drift inside a bit and allow them the side-line, but hell, not bad at all to be honest.

Stambouli and Mason were fine. Looks like Mason really needs a rest. Chadli similarly needs  a rest it looks like. They pressured the midfield as well as I expected them to against Mata/Rooney. 

Eriksen and Kane are looking more fluid. Kane looks tired but god damn he is becoming sublime. I'd like to see him get a rest so that his energy levels stay up and he doesn't become jaded.

Let me be more verbose: If you enter the United Kingdom illegally, have no leave to remain and no recourse to public funds then no, some avenues of appeal should *not* be available to you under the law.

It should not be permissible to find a British girlfriend and claim that just because you take her daughter to the park once a week, that establishes your Article 8 right to a family life.

If you have no right to be in the United Kingdom in the first place, then you shouldn't be resorting to desperate measures to remain.

In particular they should play to their only strength which is the publics support for their ""cost of living crisis"" mentality... So for example stronger legalisation on relevant areas like rental law (in favour of tenants), energy/water/oil companies (in favour of consumers) and cheaper public transport. They should focus less on talking about the economy where the conservatives obviously have greater public support. They could take a leaf out of the Tory book and simply match whatever the conservatives put on the table in terms of the economy...

That's a nice conclusion you reached, followed up by the smashing it over the bar comment. Mason is giving the ball away, absolutely, but I'm seeing him giving the ball away when he is trying to move the ball quickly from back to front. Dembele doesn't naturally do that; he dribbles and he often passes sideways. 

I love having Dembele play against teams where the CM's press high and are good tacklers. We're going to see this against Chelsea and I think playing patient possession will fit Dembele perfectly.

You're forgetting that back then there was essentially no choice. It was either vote Labour in Scotland or piss your vote against the wall. Since then, the SNP have emerged as an enormous political force and their success at Holyrood has made them a more credible choice to a lot of people. Current polls predict a landslide for them and SNP popularity has only increased since Murphy became Scottish Labour Leader.

&gt;I wouldn't be willing to write him off just yet

Unless he turns out to be some sort of political messiah (and his previous record isn't that good), I'd say he's basically a lame duck already. He has done nothing to help Labour in the polls and it looks like their strategy for winning the next election will be ""vote Labour or get a Tory government"", and as we've seen with the rise of UKIP, that line of argument doesn't seem to work.

Perhaps the action in itself isn't that significant, but we need to question the motives behind it. Why is it worth investing such a vast amount of resources on making such a fundamental legislation change? Perhaps it be better focusing on a school reform, streamlining the NHS, or something beneficial to the population.

Say the government's annual repayments on the loans is something around half a billion a year. You have the choice of leaving it the fuck alone and not refinancing, or you have the choice of borrowing five times as much (at a lower rate) to get rid of these ancient debts quickly.

With the former option, you have a steady annual decrease in your debt, continuing in the same vein as it has done over the last 200 years, with the added benefit of not having an extra amount of debt to pay off every year, because you've decided not to borrow against those loans anymore. Your level of debt decreases immediately, and continues to decrease, year on year.

With the latter, you've just increased the national debt by 2.5bn and will have to support that increase for years to come, until eventually, god knows how many years in the future, you reach the level of debt you would have been in, if you'd not paid off these historic loans which, let's face it, weren't hurting anyone.

Oh, and that's assuming you don't refinance the £2.5bn at a lower rate...and that's assuming our financial standing stays good and the lender doesn't increase the interest rate, or demand it back sooner.

false,ryanmcco,null,null,"Righty, I can chip in here. I was working in England for 7 years but recently got a job back here, I've been getting the train from Lisburn to Belfast since Sept... wife has been driving to town for 6 years.

The Roads are shite, even if the busses were quicker, you've got accidents and bombscares that will pretty much close the place down on a 1/month average.

I have to say I remember the old NIR and I am very much impressed by the new NIR.  The trains are very reliable and i'm yet to have had a cancellation or a significant delay.

But parking at lisburn station is utter shit.  If you aren't there by 0730 you're goign to end up parking up the side of Wallace park or Friends School.  There is enough room for 100's of spaces, but (sexist but true) there are a large number of middle aged women who arrive there at 7.15 and leave enough room for 90% of a car to fit into between each car.. meaning that instead of having space for 200 cars, only 100 fit in.  It fucking pisses me off and if i see you doing it, i'll be the angry fat guy with a beard screaming at you. :)

A monthly M-Link (smartphone app) is £80 between the two, I generally get a seat on the train and the wifi is okay, but never constant enough to do anything other than surf reddit... 

Its a 9 minute journey in to GVS from Lisburn, 11 minute on the way home.. Trains are at 0725, 0745, 0805, 0825.. on the way back.. 1638,1701, 1721 and 1740 nice and fast.

I tend to get the 0745 and be in work for 8am, leave about 1710 and am sitting at home with my feet up at 1745.

If I park in belfast its expensive, so i'd rule that out, my wife takes 45mins+ of horrible traffic each way, but she's down the titanic quarter.

You may be interested to know that they're building a big Park and Ride on the Knockmore Road which should have more spaces in 2015 (though, who knows if it'll happen)

I'd say take the train, its better than anything on the Road and far better value than anything i'd dealt with in London.",0,1419779778,null,0,false,0,cn7e29r,t3_2qhshz,t1_cn7e29r,t3_2qhshz,null,1425182506,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

false,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Surely as long as it works with the browser, the OS underneath makes no difference at all? Can someone explain why this would be the case and why they haven't fixed it?

The internet that you see is made up of open standards (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), which run in the browser, and then extra content provided through plugins (Silverlight, Flash, Java, etc) which have to be installed and updated separately. That's incidentally why Java and Flash are constantly asking to be updated. 

These plug ins have to be created for every platform that they're going to run on - someone has to create Flash for Windows, Flash for Mac, Flash for Android etc, and you're basically reliant on the whim of their corporate backer to do that. Flash was supported by Adobe on Linux for a long time, but it was dropped a year or two back. Luckily enough in that case Google stepped in to create their own reverse engineered plugin.

Until quite recently there was no decent way to stream video using the open standards, which is why YouTube and other sites have used Flash or Silverlight. Until very recently there was no way to do DRM using open standards, which is important for sites like Netflix that host third party content. Both of those have now changed, which is why Netflix is just starting to work completely cross platform. This is a big step forward.

Incidentally, the same process is going on for mobile apps. People are trying to create web apps that use open standards, and are not tied to Android, Windows Phone, iOS etc. That's what FirefoxOS is about. In general, this is an important thing. It means you are not tied to a single platform controlled by a single corporate backer.",0,1419780026,null,0,1419780331,0,cn7e52x,t3_2qkjwo,t1_cn7e52x,t1_cn7cvet,null,1425182471,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The thing is, if you read that one paragraph then yes it does seem sexist.

They want to reduce the numbers of those in prison and move more towards helping people be rehabilitated back into functioning members of society.

Some other sections from the manifesto:

&gt;CJ344 Current non-custodial sentences such as Community Service and Probation would continue to be used, but the use of fines would be replaced by measures which make reparation for the harm/ inconvenience caused. **In the short term emphasis would be placed on increasing the reparative element in sentencing and reducing the use of detention.**


&gt;CJ346 Sentencing practice would be constantly monitored to reveal:

&gt;a)whether it is being effective in ensuring reparation for the victim;

&gt;b)whether offenders are required to make reparation;

&gt;c)whether it is delivered in a non-discriminatory way as between different ethnic, gender and other social groups.

&gt;d)the extent to which it contributes to a reduction in crime.

&gt;CJ372 Only the Crown Court will have the power to order detention and only when it is satisfied that the public must be protected because there is a substantial risk of a further grave crime, or that the offences have caused such public alarm that the offenders presence in the community would constitute a threat to his/her own safety.

Used to work in retail myself and the whole 'hit targets or your job is on the line' is unfair and unproductive bull. A decent manager looks into why the employee isn't hitting targets and identifies ways to overcome their weaknesses (could be knowledge, confidence, lack of faith in a product). 

This practice makes the employee feel they have no choice but to 'bend the truth' in order to meet their targets and keep their manager off their back. Infinity was such a strange proposal that even the store manager couldn't tell me what happened at the end of the lease period and the rules changed on it so rapidly that often the employee simply couldn't keep up.

Basically you'd want a body to oversee it, allow for independent analysis of hardware and software and procedures, etc.

But there are plenty of ways to either anonymise or effectively anonymise data like this. Essentially you make sure that you record the person who voted and what they voted for independently or not at all. They could be link-able (but impossible without access to two sets of data that no one really has free access too) or simply record the two things completely independently with no link. Eg. you record that someone has voted, and you record the votes. So you can't vote twice, but also there's no record of where your vote actually came from.

I watched him play for england and he looked out of his depth, sure he is decent on the ball and can pick out a pass every now and then but he has a lot of downsides. He can show up big but often goes missing especially towards the second half of games where he fizzes out.

Final report

 vlaar wouldn't be my first choice but i wouldn't mind seeing him in red.

We should not sign delph, he isn't good enough to start and we have enough depth in the midfield already.

The idea is that they have access to the information, advice and expertise necessary to make an informed, rational and hopefully correct decision and ideally the constituency has elected somebody with a good moral compass. If they do a shit job, you should vote for somebody else who you believe will better represent your interests.

Of course it doesn't always work like this in practice and there are many, many situations where politicians/the government should rightly cave to public pressure, but this isn't ancient Athens, it's a representative democracy.

They are paying off these debts forever and then borrowing at 1.5% with a fixed term. It's basically paying off one credit card, with another credit card with a lower rate. 


This is most likely a good thing and crucial to reducing government expenditure. 

to massively over simplify:

You owe me 100 pounds and have been paying the interest of 4% every year, for 50 years. So 4 pounds (assuming we're not talking compound interest or anything else complex). You have paid me 200 pounds, but still owe me 100 pounds and will continue to pay me 4 pounds for eternity. Now what you do is get a loan of 100 pounds off somebody else, but at 1.5%. So you only pay £1.50 a year. Saving £2.50 a year. Similarly I would imagine that the borrowing will actually be in the form of a loan that is paid back over a fixed term, so instead of being paid in perpetuity these will be paid of in X years. Indeed you could pay 25% less (£3 pounds) and pay it off in 67 years.

Slightly unfortunate afternoon for Yoshida. He had periods of good play but struggled to cope with Hazard. The best fullbacks in the world struggle with Hazard let alone centre backs playing out of position.

Alderweireld played well again. I believe it was his shot that hit the score board? I've been a season ticket holder since I was 5 and can't remember seeing that, hilarious!

A real captains performance from Fonte today. When we were getting battererd in the second half he was instrumental in keeping our shape as well as putting in some excellent challenges.

Gardos impressed me when he came on. He looked composed and more then competent defensively. It's great to think we have 4 quality centre backs.

Solid debut from Targett. Good defensively but perhaps against less dangerous teams could do more going forward. Nevertheless we do have a very talented young fullback.

Had he been in Brana's spot today, he would have done the same while Luis bombed up the pitch. There were times when JT and Cahill were left isolated at the back and Matic and/or Mikel had to drop back thereby leaving gaps in the midfield.

New contracts really don't have a direct impact on the **possibility** of a player being sold but they do have a direct impact on the value the player has with the selling club which manifests itself in asking price/transfer fee and the higher it is, the fewer clubs that are actually interested which can reduce the **probability** of a sale.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/wiki/index

The info is a bit outdated and a bit biased, for example, St Pauls isn't THAT bad any more, but you can still use this info to get a general gist.

You're probably doing the right thing by not living in Bath as it's extremely expensive. It is nice though. 

Bristol is a lively place and there's good transport links everywhere really. If you can afford to live in the centre, do that, as you can't really go wrong. The X39 (?) bus to Bath runs quite frequently.

Alternatively, you could consider living in BS15/BS16 and taking the 319 bus to Bath, but I wouldn't personally do that as the bus takes a bit longer I think.

You could also live in Stoke Gifford and get to Bath via Parkway train station. The train is much quicker (Obviously)

Good areas **in my opinion**: Gloucester Road, Old Market, Broadmead, Harbourside, Clifton, Redcliffe, Horfield... and a few others.

Horfield and Gloucester Road are your best bet for finding a shared flat. As it's predominantly a student area and virtually half the properties there are shared lets.

A couple reasons why, for one Arsenal is keen on him and fuck them, and I really like his potential as an attacking center half. Everybody says we have Kalas as a future CB, but I dunno if I'm alone on this, I wouldn't mind having him tried out as a RB, similar to Iva. One thing for sure though is Kalas needs to be recalled from Koln, and loaned to some place that will actually play him, as /u/Mobile_leprechaun said, fuck FC Koln. The future back 4 then in this scenario has Schar as the attacking center half, Zouma as the more defensive one, Kalas at RB, and Dave at LB. 

This transfer would be for the sole purpose of the future though because the present squad as is needs no changes really. The one player who might move during the January window that I wouldn't mind seeing on the squad is Asamoah, but there's just simply no room for him.

Let's get a few things straight here, from the get go:

-The penalty against Reid was indeed a penalty.

-By the rulebook the goal Song scored was absolutely offsides.

That all being said, we were very unlucky not to get all three points, or at least not to pull one out of it. Now we've had a nightmare of a weekend and went from 4th to 6th, tied with Spurs but leading on goal difference. I didn't expect to get anything from a trip to Chelsea, but losing at home to Arsenal really hurt us. A point here was a huge point.

It's so unfortunate that Adrian has played his best two games of the year in back to back losses. He was outstanding again today. Absolutely top class.

Reid and Song were both very disappointing. Reid, you can't lift your leg and interfere like that. It's a penalty 100% of the time. Song, stop trying to do everything and just do the right thing. You're a good enough player to outclass your opponent in 1-on-1s if you just keep it simple.

I thought Carroll and Downing played well. I thought O'Brien was shit. I thought Amalfitano gave the squad a lot of energy. I thought Sakho should have been left on.

Can't blame the manager for how we played. We were the better squad for 88 of the 90 minutes, but conceded 2 goals in those 2 minutes. Leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

The good news is: halfway through the year we're sitting in 6th place. The second half of the season is going to be tough, but we know we've got the talent to slug it out with just about anyone.

We kept trying to attack down the right like we had Jenkinson's pace and crossing ability present. He wasn't there - so why didn't we go with the diamond and stick with a more fluid midfield? Jenkinson has been the driving force for our attacks down the wing. We should have relied more on our passing game in midfield. 

Their first goal was a penalty, for me. One you bitch about when it happens to you in fifa because your defenders went full retard briefly, but still a penalty. 

I would have preferred a diamond midfield as I said before, but I don't feel I can fault Sam for the decisions he made over these last two games. Were it not for the disallowed goal, we'd have had a point here. 4-3-3 CAN work for us, but it feels like we struggle far more to develop penetration into the attacking third with it. I know it's supposed to be an attacking formation and all but it just feels overly defensive - and we can't say that's just a function of Jenks being missing because we ran the same formation WITH Jenks at Chelsea.

First, was the erosion of debt by unanticipated high inflation.

&gt;

&gt;""the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as [Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell)'s discovery of the [laws of electrodynamics""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations)

&gt;__Scottish inventions and discoveries__ are objects, processes or techniques either partially or entirely invented or discovered by a person born in or descended from [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). In some cases, an invention's Scottishness is determined by the fact that it came into existence in Scotland (e.g., [animal cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning#Dolly_the_Sheep)), by non-Scots working in the country. Often, things that are [discovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation\)) for the first time are also called ""[inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventions)"" and in many cases there is no clear line between the two.

&gt;The Scots take enormous pride in the history of Scottish invention and discovery. There are many books devoted solely to the subject, as well as scores of websites listing Scottish inventions and discoveries with varying degrees of science.

&gt;Even before the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution), Scots have been at the forefront of innovation and discovery across a wide range of spheres. Some of the most significant products of Scottish ingenuity include [James Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt)'s [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine), improving on that of [Thomas Newcomen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen),  the [bicycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle),  [macadamisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadamised) (not to be confused with [tarmac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmac) or tarmacadam ), the [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) invented by [Alexander Graham Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell),  [John Logie Baird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logie_Baird)'s invention of television,   [Alexander Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming)'s discovery of [penicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin),  and the discoveries of [electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetics), [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar),  and [insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin). 

&gt;The following is a list of inventions or discoveries that are in some way Scottish.

My daughter married in May this year. We found the perfect venue and it was not cheap, but we knew that, if we went anywhere else, we'd always be thinking of what could have been. There were 70 adults and 12 children at the service (which was held in the same hotel as the wedding breakfast) and about another 50 guests attended the evening buffet. The total cost was broken down roughly as follows:

- Venue; including meal, evening buffet, drinks, etc: £15,000
- Decor, cake, DJ/Harpist: £1,500
- Registrar: £540
- Cars: £950
- Flowers: £1,500
- Photographer: £1,350
- Dress/Bridesmaid dresses/Groomsmen's suits: £3,000
- Stationery/Favours: £600
- Rooms at hotel for guests (funded by us): £1,500
- Wedding insurance/General other stuff: £600

**Total £26,540**

World War I: British government (HMG) borrowed about £1 billion (US$4bn) from US private investors to buy arms and equipment from the US (compared to about £5bn/$20bn from domestic investors).

1918-31: Repayments to US private investors were made after the War using reparations from Germany. The reparations weren't always payed and therefore HMG's payments were also sporadic.

1931: Young Plan (proposed by the Americans) cancelled most of the German reparations. As part of the deal, the US government announced a moratorium on HMG's war debts. Repayments never resumed.

1939-41: World War II Cash-and-carry: HMG bought armaments in the US. Under the Neutrality Act, they had to be paid for in cash, so HMG seized and sold all kinds of investments held around the world by British individuals and firms at fire-sale prices (they got IOUs for after the War). Ships were also sold for basing rights.

1941-45: World War II Lend-Lease: The US 'loaned' arms and military equipment to HMG, in the knowledge that they would never be returned. I think food supplies, etc., for civilians were still bought for cash.

1946: Anglo-American loan: The US government loaned HMG £1 billion/US$4bn in exchange for policies that helped US firms in the European market. The money was used (a) to pay the US 10% of the value of Lend-Lease goods held by HMG or in transit and (b) to pay for the cost of Britain's post-war military operations (German occupation, China coast, Persian Gulf, Greek civil war, oil for the worldwide naval presence, etc.).

I thought about mentioning risk in my early post but I left it out in the interests of trying (and possibly failing) to keep it brief.

The answer is that the risk attached to bonds is variable.  Obviously whenever somebody lends money they take a risk - there is a possibility that the person, company or other entity that the money is lent to may not make the payments required.  This is reflected both in whether you're willing to make the loan at all, and in what sort interest rates you might charge.  Bonds are no different in this regard.

When evaluating a particular bond the credit worthiness of the issuer is a fundamental consideration.  This also plays into the price of a particular bond on the secondary bond market.  There's a [whole industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating) devoted to rating the credit-worthiness of governments, companies and other bond issuers (although that industry has come in for a lot of criticism in the last few years for being less impartial than it should be).

Regarding NS &amp; I they are a branch of the government.  The money you have in Premium Bonds is effectively leant to the government until such time as you cash it in. In the meantime the government pays you and the rest of the Premium Bond owners 1.35% interest on average through the prize fund - that's not a bad deal for them compared with alternative forms of borrowing.",0,1419789315,null,0,false,0,cn7hszy,t3_2qj1e5,t1_cn7hszy,t1_cn6xqa0,null,1425180689,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

&gt;In [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment), the __bond credit rating__ represents the [credit worthiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_worthiness) of corporate or government [bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance\)). It is not to be confused with an individual's [credit score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score). The ratings are published by [Credit rating agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency) and used by investment professionals to assess the likelihood the debt will be repaid.

She's born an ordinary girl who, by her own choice, commits a heroic sacrifice and saves the universe by jumping into the time-stream. In other words, the story you think you saw is the one Moffat deliberately tricks the audience into thinking with the second half of Series 7, only to subvert in Name of the Doctor. You misread Moffat's favorite trick: Narrative substitution.

As for your example, that episode turned out to be a dream. And a big theme of the episode is how things don't always make sense in dreams. And even evaluating that under the pretense that she would have acted the exact same in a real situation, scouting out the room to see where the crab is (if it escaped the room or not) isn't an entirely unreasonable thing to do. The Doctor would have probably done the same, but truthfully, it's just a directorial choice meant to build suspense. Using it as a criticism of Clara as a whole is a weak argument, as the plot would dictate almost any character who entered that room to act in that way. And then again, dream.

I've seen much more sound arguments for Clara having a weak characterization (none of which I actually agree with), and though I know you were probably just trying to come up with a loose answer on the fly, your criticisms are largely a product of misreading her character arc and I find it hard to take them too seriously.

Sorry if it seems like I just singled you out there, I just saw your comment first and thought I may as well type out some thought. I also apologize for acting a bit stand-offish. And for being a little bit too apologetic.

Do you mean 'statute of limitations' - if so, not all laws have a statute of limitations, but some do.

In terms of debts, there is such a thing as Statute Barred Debt, but the requirements for a debt no longer being valid is that the debtor has made no payments for 6 years and no attempts have been made to recover money in that time. 

The government has been paying the interest on the debt continuously so it wouldn't apply.  Also the debts predate the law.

Also, if every time the government sold a bond, it was on the understanding that after so long it would just become worthless for no other reason than that time had passed, the government would find it far harder to sell bonds, and consequently the cost of borrowing would go way up, putting us more into debt, meaning we'd have to borrow even more, etc.

First of all something I've been typing for what seems like forever, is our lack of width, today he put Garbutt and Baines on and played Baines through the middle and Eto'o on the left? madness! the tactic seems to be slowly look for the passes, which doesn't work when they line 10 men up along the box line, but because our wing backs can't get into space without being left open at the back we try and walk it through a brick wall.

The passing is too slow and uninspired, which I don't put down to Martinez, I put down to the players, no ones moving, and when they do the pass to them is behind them which instantly kills the run, if I was Martinez I'd run nothing but 1 touch pass and move drills until their legs fell off. I'd drop Eto'o he's getting frustrated now, I'd play Garbutt at left back Baines left wing, Mirallas on the right ahead of Coleman Besic instead of Barry and Kone &amp; Lukaku up front, though after the performances over the last month, I'd drop the entire squad.

Teams know what to do against us now, we build up too slowly and when it breaks down send it all the way back to our defenders and all they have to do is slowly let their forwards press and it end up at the keepers feet then they win without fail the second ball and start a fast paced attack against us. Nobody wants to take a risk and maybe play the ball over the top or try and play a fast ball past the opposition because none of ours look like they'll move to get on the end of it.

I want Deulofeu back because of his selfishness now. He'd take a ball all the way to the touchline and whip it across which today was our best chances, coleman and Baines taking the ball to the corner flag and putting it across the box on the floor for someone to get on the end of.

The system needs to be tweaked, it worked last season because we let teams onto us then passed through them, but you cant pass through an entire team lined up on the 12 yard line, stop trying to walk it in and just tell Mirallas, Lukaku and Barkley to start hitting them.

the players are getting frustrated, the fans are getting frustrated and Bobby is too, the system works, we know it does but there needs to be a second system because teams know whats going to happen any time we come up against them. we need some surprises and some sucker punches in our game now.

Also it's no excuse but we should have seen 5 players sent off against us in as many weeks, it's disgraceful the lack of consistency being shown.",0,1419791050,null,0,false,0,cn7in0i,t3_2qmrnb,t1_cn7in0i,t3_2qmrnb,null,1425180300,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

I guess it's debatable, perhaps it is NK. But that doesn't change the fact that Gaza virtually is a concentration camp, and a pretty huge one at that.

&gt;That would be because Hamas fires missiles, suicide bombs or simply murders Israeli citizens as well...

Several points here:

* Before the 70s resistance to Israel was primarily conducted by the secular nationalists and the PLO, both were pretty decent. Israel allowed Hamas to develop by cracking down on the secularists but *not* on Hamas in order to create internal divisions and to weaken Palestine. Moreover, it was the West that created the Muslim Brotherhood and the other organisations that would eventually turn into Hamas. They **only** exist because of Western and Israeli policy.

* You cannot strip Hamas's actions from their historical context. I - obviously - don't support terrorism in any form but you have to see the terrorism of Hamas as a response to the terrorism of Israel, and the ethnic cleansing and almost industrial levels of murder that Israel has carried out since its inception. 

* If Britain or America were occupied for decades, wouldn't you fire missiles at the occupiers?

* Finally, let's compare [the casualty figures](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28439404) for the attacks by Israel and the attacks by Hamas. Over 2,000 Palestinian civilians killed during Operation Protective Edge, and only **7** Israeli civilians.

&gt;For the most part, you are correct here.

Glad you agree.

&gt;What International law has it breached?

That would be the stealing of land. I'll quote Wikipedia here:

&gt;**The international community considers the establishment of Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories illegal under international law**, however Israel maintains that they are consistent with international law because it does not agree that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the territories occupied in the 1967 Six-Day War. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Court of Justice and the High Contracting Parties to the Convention have all affirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention does apply.

&gt;Numerous UN resolutions have stated that the building and existence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights **are a violation of international law**, including UN Security Council resolutions in 1979 and 1980. UN Security Council Resolution 446 refers to the Fourth Geneva Convention as the applicable international legal instrument, and calls upon Israel to desist from transferring its own population into the territories or changing their demographic makeup. The reconvened Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions has **declared the settlements illegal** as has the primary judicial organ of the UN, the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

&gt;**The majority of legal scholars hold the settlements to violate international law**, while others have offered dissenting views supporting the Israeli position.

.

&gt;Unless of course you notice Israel provides Palestinian citizens of Israel equal rights, unlike EVERY OTHER country with Palestinians in the area...

*Sigh...* Israel does not provide Palestinian citizens with equal rights. In fact Hendrik Verwoerd, the South African Prime Minister and the architect of apartheid said:

&gt;""Israel is not consistent in its new anti-apartheid attitude ... they took Israel away from the Arabs after the Arabs lived there for a thousand years. In that, I agree with them. Israel, like South Africa, is an apartheid state."" 

But since you probably won't accept the opinion of a racist I'll skim over the reasons *why* Israel is an apartheid state.

&gt;In a 2007 report, United Nations Special Rapporteur for Palestine John Dugard stated, ""elements of the Israeli occupation constitute forms of colonialism and of apartheid, which are contrary to international law"" and suggested that the ""legal consequences of a prolonged occupation with features of colonialism and apartheid"" be put to the International Court of Justice.

Then there's the 2003 law that makes inhabitants of Iran, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, and areas governed by the Palestinian Authority ineligible for the automatic granting of Israeli citizenship and residency permits that is usually available through marriage to an Israeli citizen. One of Israel's chief justices said:

&gt;""This violation of rights is directed against Arab citizens of Israel. As a result, therefore, the law is a violation of the right of Arab citizens in Israel to equality.""

In addition,

&gt;Heodor Or chaired the Or Commission, which noted that discrimination against the country's Arab citizens had been documented in a large number of professional surveys and studies, had been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions, and had also found expression in reports by the state comptroller and in other official documents.

Perhaps most seriously,

&gt;In 2007, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination reported that Palestinians and Israeli settlers in the occupied territories are subject to different criminal laws, leading to longer detention and harsher punishments for Palestinians than for Israelis for the same offenses. Amnesty International has reported that in the West Bank, Israeli settlers and soldiers who engage in abuses against Palestinians, including unlawful killings, enjoy ""impunity"" from punishment and are rarely prosecuted. However Palestinians detained by Israeli security forces may be imprisoned for prolonged periods of time, and reports of their torture and other ill-treatment are not credibly investigated.

I wouldn't have expected the director of the American Jewish Congress to have a particularly anti-Israeli viewpoint and yet,

&gt;Henry Siegman, a former national director of the American Jewish Congress, has stated that the network of settlements in the West Bank has created an ""irreversible colonial project"" aimed to foreclose the possibility of a viable Palestinian state. According to Siegman, in accomplishing this Israel has ""crossed the threshold from 'the only democracy in the Middle East' to the only apartheid regime in the Western world"". Siegman argues that denial of both self-determination and Israeli citizenship to Palestinians amounts to a ""double disenfranchisement"", which when based on ethnicity amounts to racism. Siegman continues to state that reserving democracy for privileged citizens and keeping others ""behind checkpoints and barbed wire fences"" is the opposite of democracy.

And of course, the apartheid road laws. There are a vast number of point about these but for the sake of brevity I'll just quote one,

&gt;The human rights NGO B'Tselem has indicated that such policies have isolated some Palestinian communities and state that Israel's road regime ""based on the principle of separation through discrimination, bears striking similarities to the racist apartheid regime that existed in South Africa until 1994""

Surely the police forcibly not allowing them to enter the building would be assault, since they were entitled to be there at the time the first order was made?

Without any real opinion or prejudice on squatters, etc. this story makes me so mad just because of the games that were played by the police.

false,synx508,null,null,"Correct, but if the damage was caused due to a defect, either in design, construction or materials, then you are covered. The extended warranties aren't sold solely as insurance, there's a blurring of the lines that makes customers forget their statutory rights. It's sold more like ""what if something goes wrong?"".

Home contents insurance may well cover accidental damage, too, so it's worth checking to make sure you're not insuring something twice.

If something breaks under normal use before it is reasonably expected to do so, then it's covered by the sale of goods act, so the retailer needs to step in and sort the problem and preferably also give the manufacturer some strongly worded feedback. Ever such a lot of people don't realise this is the case. Some retailers (including those mentioned by OP) try to deflect complaints about lousy products by putting customers in touch with manufacturers directly. This becomes engrained and people forget that the retailer is responsible for selling products of satisfactory quality.

A friend repeated fell into this trap with a troublesome washing machine which she'd had ineffectually repaired a number of times and even replaced twice by the manufacturer, it was clearly failing because of inherent design problems or poor quality control. Eventually the friend was persuaded to take up the issue with the original retailer, which was a good move as they were shocked by the story and kicked the manufacturer's backside into upgrading to their top-of-the-range model and adding a promise that if this model failed they'd replace it for free with a different brand.

We rented from them for for a year and was going to move into another property (begrudgingly) owned by them and I was astounded by how a company could behave in such a manner and get away with it.

First of all they don't let you sign the contract until the day you move in (all my friends with other companys signed it when they agreed). They do this for the single reason that if they want to pull out before the move in date at ANY point they can and will. We had them do this one week before we were meant to move in meaning I was starting uni in two weeks with no house. They were so rude and unsympathetic.

Also from what I gather after reading other reviews of them that they are known to landlords as taking on houses that aren't fit to live in. All of my friends houses were in a bad state. Our house it turned out would actually get so damp that the walls would be soaking wet after it rained. Additionally when you complained about any damp issue they would either blame you for not preventing it or say there's nothing they can do (if you could even get to speak to someone at all). My friends with other agents had issues but weren't confronted with such disrespect when they reported them. They displayed a high level of deceit through the year of renting from them.

So after we had these issues with them we thought surely there must be some where we can complain about this company. No there isn't. Homelets is one of the only letting agents in Brighton who don't belong to a governing body. Additionally when we spoke to the council and the uni all they said is really there is 'nothing they can do' but 'get  away from homelets as fast as you can'. The guy at the uni said we were one of multiple people who had rang him. So basically they are unchecked so they can not be held accountable for there immoral practices.

Sorry for the long post but this is a shortened down version of some of the things I could have said. This was not just a one bad experience all of my friends had varying amount of bad feelings towards them after renting with them.  Unfortunately for student housing they are one of the biggest letting agents so they are hard to escape from. 

But overall my advise in looking for a house is above space and rooms look for mould damp and good heating/insulation. Then hopefully you won't have to speak to your letting agents. Also use 'Sussex student lettings' the day the list comes out the houses are cheaper and you usually rent straight from the owner which from what i gather is a better experience. Good luck my friend and don't let those crooked letting agents get to you!

Edit; 
I forgot to add if you are an international student don't rent from them AT ALL. My friend who went back home this year couldn't get her deposit back because 'they can't deposit it into an international bank account'. So they said she could pick up a cheque but she would have to come back and do it in person. So she did... but 'the person who could write the cheques 'was not in for the week'... complete CON ARTISTS operating under the guise of a company. TELL ALL YOUR FREINDS NEVER DEAL WITH HOMELETS.

The existing rule and the proposed one are bad in two ways: Employers in the UK need specialists, especially those who end up with research degrees. The UK cannot satisfy the demand locally and to some extent not even from the EU. EU students have their own top-notch universities where they don't have to overcome the language barrier.

There are several managers in the PcWorld/Currys setup that are ""bad eggs"", they are the managers of old, where customers didn't know and margins were large.

If you have a bad manager, you usually get bad employees.  It isn't that the employee is inherently bad, it's the direction they're receiving from the top thats bad, bad manager doing things outside of policy or procedure makes it firstly appear to the colleague that it's ok to not follow policy or procedure because the manager didn't, and secondly, it's ok to misadvise the customer.


Your friend, has a bad manager/trainer.  Because its nowhere in the training that wasting customers time is beneficial.


Your timescales (20/80) seems high, I'd probably put it the other way round for a quick sale, and 50/50 for a long (depending on the time spent asking questions about the product etc).  But yes, colleagues are targeted on the WEH, if you're unsure, they'll go to their floor manager to see if there is any discount to work with to try and hook you.  The KPI's (Key Performance Index/Indices) are high margin items, that the colleague is targeted on selling, (For the most part they make sense, buying a laptop you're going to need some form of Internet Security, maybe Office, perhaps you'd like us to set it all up for you and give you a 30 minute one-on-one demonstration because you've never used windows 8 before)

But yes, even though you have everything and just want the laptop, the colleague is still obliged to go through it and see what deal they can do with the manager.  Sucks, but the sales colleagues are targeted on their sales. 


But to your original thing, Go into different Currys/PcWorld stores and you'd be amazed at how a companies customer service level can change depending on the store.  It's something that personally annoys me, as regardless of how well I do or the store does, there are many other stores with terrible service and bad managers who drag the image down.

Speeding as a term is an odd one, as it can be discretionary. I personally, like I said before, have no problem with someone speeding (within reason) unless they are hindering other road users. 

By that I mean; Following emergency vehicles through traffic, tailgating, bullying road users (by honking or flashing lights). 

Our speed limits should be reconsidered yes, there are plenty of roads that should have a higher speed limit, but drivers arent trust worthy enough to respond to situations or changes ahead of them. By this, I mean, you could have a 30 limit a 50, but if a child is walking along said road, you have to respond to the chance that, that child may run out. Now it is not your responsibility to keep said child controlled, but it is your responsibility (within reason) to stop your vehicle enough to cause little to no harm to that child if they do run. 

When I said consiquences, I also mean that, normally, the person causing the accident due to negligence or speed, suffers less injury than the 3rd party. This is not an exact science but it is usually the case. If you cause an accident and you were speeding, you should hold your hands up and say 'yup I did it, I made the mistake' not spend 4 months terrorising a family with court cases because you don't have a backbone. There is also that always lingering probability you are going to take someones life. Can you live with that?

My point is, that know when to risk it, and know when to slow down.. You will never foresee what is round that corner.

false,wesleynukem,null,null,"I'm going to try to draw some positives from this, so I don't blow my brains out:

1) I remember Bobby talking last season about Baines playing as a holding midfielder... he assumed that role at times today and looked pretty good doing it (including that excellent assist to Mirallas).

2) Mirallas is playing out of his mind and when we sell him in the summer, we're going to make a lot off of him.

3) Kone is the anti-Lukaku... way better at hold-up play but lacks the same ability to create something out of nothing.

Of course, there were a ton of negatives:

1) Joel just isn't cut out to be a Premier League keeper. He is completely unable to hold onto the ball.

2) Barry looks lost, he's like the old man in your pick-up game who doesn't even attempt to play the ball and just wants to shatter your tibia.

3) If this was FIFA, our chemistry rating would be about a 40 (bad). McGeady looked like he wanted to shank Eto'o, and there seemed to be general confusion about what everybody's role is. Nobody provided a target when Kone stepped out of position to help out on the wings. And don't forget that play in the second half where our guys double teamed a Newcastle player, won the ball, and then the two Everton players stopped and stared at the ball, unsure of who was going to take it.

Final assessment: I'm not panicking, as 8-17th place are ~~all the same~~ somewhat similar, and it still looks like we're going to be in edit: the higher end of one of those spots. That being said, Roberto needs to show some initiative and bring in 1) a true winger 2) another CB and 3) a third keeper. Right now, Mirallas and McGeady are our only real wingers (save for Atsu, who's rumored to be leaving in January) and truthfully, Mirallas plays better towards the center of the pitch. I don't think Distin, Alcaraz, and Jagielka are done, but I also think you can't pair any of those two together – you need at least one quicker CB who can play with the ball at his feet.

I'd love to see a side that looked like

This is great news for you as a consumer, because it makes them answerable to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and the burden of proof is on RentSmart if you complain. If you genuinely believe you were mis-sold, then you need to register a complaint with RentSmart. Make it clear to them that you were misadvised at point of sale, and that you either want the service they provide to perform as you were led to expect that it would, or you expect a full refund with redress. Make it clear that you will take your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you are unable to reach a resolution with them. Be aware that when the Ombudsman looks at your case, it costs RentSmart £550 regardless of the outcome, and they know that.

I presume you signed an agreement in store and that document contains the terms and conditions in question.

I think if the author wants to critique foreign policy he should critique foreign policy as all three main parties have signed off on the Afghanistan war and have made very few political points off the war. The author could perhaps consistently title that the center has a failed foreign policy as well as the right and arguably the center left. The real failure of the afghan war is the lack of a functioning Afghan army which is bizarre since when Nato invaded there was a functioning antitaliban force the northern alliance . It wouldn't be nation building and less contractors would have gotten rich but instead of throwing money at karzai money should have been thrown at the northern alliance and perhaps one loyal Pashtun tribe even if it doesn't sound very good.

I basically had multiple active spots, all of which were extremely hard, raised and painful. The before pics are after I smothered my face with benzoyl peroxide. This was fairly successful for me, it helped to kill off the active spots but didn't prevent future spots. 

One day I just had enough and went to the doctor. I've been taking oxytetracycline for about 3 months, and I haven't had any active spots since. I can also no longer feel spots forming under my skin (I could feel them weeks before they actually came out). I also started taking the contraceptive pill which seems to have helped also. 

I revisited my doctor recently who offered to refer me to dermatology to commence roaccutane. I declined though, as my acne isn't even active anymore and I didn't feel the side effects were worth it. Instead I'm taking antibiotics for 6 more months. 

What I'm working with now is scarring I guess. My skin is smooth, but red where the horrid acne damaged it before. My current routine is as follows;

AM - Wash with cerave, moisturise with cerave (in the pump bottle)
PM - Remove make up with a wipe

It's basic but it seems not to be upsetting my skin. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to tackle the redness? I'm keen to introduce cerave SPF into my routine.

He's a bloody great player, but he's a poacher, not a magician. He'll get us goals but not in the way that Taarabt did. He won't randomly turn on the magic and score a goal on his own from a seemingly impossible situation, but if you leave him lurking in the box and you feed him he'll get you something. 

The entire team needs to work if Charlie is to work. People need to be pumping in balls into the box, delivering something to his feet or head. But no one did. There were no real chances ""created"" as such by us the entire game. 

Barton was poor. Fer was worse. But worst of all was Zamora, who won precisely nothing all game long. We need to start transitioning away from the ""hoof it to Bobby"" strategy, I think. It's not exactly a recipe for long term success. 

And therein the problem with Harry. He just doesn't have the tactical mind to make that kind of a change. We played his beloved 4-4-2 with two strikers and two wingers who can run at their defenders, and the rest of them can just fackin' run around a bit. The problem is that Hoilett and Philips just aren't good enough. And we have no plan b.

Most alarming of all is that we have now had all the ""easy"" home games, and now come the ""easy"" away games. Which means we have to win away or beat mid and top table teams at home. It'll be a tough second half of the season, especially remembering that we'll need a big points cushion for the difficult run-in. Hope Harry has his eyes on some good transfer targets this January.

I'd like a [pre-v-tech version as a streetfighter](http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r2/casebite/IMG_0471sized.jpg) for summer-fun, and the V-tec version for practically everything else.

I did design them myself, and the logos etc are all from the WipEout series of games, of which i'm a huge fan as they tend to use excellent design. Naturally; I'm also a big fan of The Designers Republic who did all the design for the first game. It's generally the style i'm most fond of: Stark minimalism and very well considered design. Bold, brash, playful and communicative.

I should also mention that i'm a graphic designer, but not prone to arty-bullshit too often.

As for printing; Not sure yet. But it'd all be applied as cut vinyl and not actually printed. The idea is to get the base-colour applied, then various logos and then a clear layer of vinyl to seal it all in, protect it, and give it a nice glossy finish. All for less than a paint job, and removable. So i can then either change it, or sell it and have the paint in the same condition as when i buy it.

My only issue with the pre-v-tec is the body styling. Not a fan. If i could fit a v-tec fairing kit to it: Bonus. Would totally do that provided it wasn't amazingly expensive.",0,1419801479,null,0,false,0,cn7o2a0,t3_2qksi5,t1_cn7o2a0,t1_cn7nltt,null,1425177698,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

So I guess I'll give you that - of the three new writers, two of them didn't do very well almost universally)

It's also interesting to note that out of the 13 episodes, 8 of them were either written by Steven Moffat or co-written with him.

A draw would have been seen as a good result before we played the match. They barely gave our players a room to shoot the ball. In matches like this you need a bit of luck to win and we were clearly denied a penalty. Our players played really good. Of all the teams that played today, we looked the sharpest even though we were just as tired as the rest of them. You are out of your mind, if you were expecting a riot. We are still sitting at the top of the League. Considering fatigue and all these matches played consecutively. In this period, i will always take an ugly 1 nil win or a draw against a top 7 team in the league. Now, we have another very tough away match against Spurs. I want us to win, but another draw won't be a bad result. This one hurts because we were denied a penalty, forget about the shots on target. We can't always create lots of chances. Their defense was solid, they were only looking for a point and there is nothing wrong with that. That penalty would have changed the game, they would have open up instead of just sitting like ducks.

edit: This what Jose said after the match about shots on target. ""Southampton defended with everything and they defended a lot. They played with a central defender at right-back, they accumulated a lot of players behind the ball and they did well with their strategy of closing everything. We tried everything and we dominated, we created a lot. Sometimes the shots on-target statistics are not the best evidence of the football played. We played a lot, especially in the second half.""

Rub in Lace Market is also a tasty new place serving barbecued and slow cooked meats. They do large platters that are nice to share with a few people. They're new enough to be very flexible in your requests, if you wanted a smaller child portion I'm sure they'd do it.

It's a 3 hour 45 minute drive from Ushuhia to the border crossing via the the only other town in the province (Rio Grande). It genuinely looks like there's literally one route across the whole thing.

Also this is an isolated province of barely more than 100k people (think Shetland Islands geography with a population of the Channel Islands). I doubt the local police had anything like the resources they needed. A 3 hour escorted drive against an organised mob is something British police would struggle with without a fair bit of foreword planning.

The mob are cunts - but I'm willing to give the police the benefit of the doubt that they did what they could. UNLESS they did have the early tip off and just didn't take it seriously enough.

If I remember correctly, Sherwood lost horribly against West Ham and Arsenal in the cup. If I recall, we didn't play very well. 
Also, the players who seemed to *want* to play for him were typically from the clubs roots. Smarmy comments about expensive signings aren't going to go down with higher-ups who forked that money out, whether they agree with him or not. 

Every manager has maybe said something controversial in the post match interview, but to say that he doesn't trust individuals, and that they know who they are, is perhaps a bit daring as an interim manager.

Now, I personally am neither for or against Tim Sherwood. As a player and coach for Spurs, I think he should be applauded. As a *head* coach, his behaviour was questionable and perhaps his time was too short to judge. Pochettinho may be a little more reserved in his answers, but I think his transition is speaking for itself. 

It's easy to get on the side of any fans by acting like a local boy. Take Lewis Holtby, for example. I love the character of that lad off the pitch. It just so happens that I rate him highly as a player, too. 

You see the same agenda now with the Redknapp family. They seem very bitter. I think it's fair to say that AVB usually only speaks about his past when questioned about it. Whereas we know that isn't the case with the Redknapps and Sherwood. 

But it all comes down to what you want in a manager. This is where the real divide comes in. Some rather lose or draw with pride, and some rather win with none. ",0,1419804902,null,0,false,0,cn7pvtv,t3_2qkgod,t1_cn7pvtv,t1_cn70rg1,null,1425176849,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Whether you believe Sanchez wanted London or not, we lost out to him and it's those kinds of deals that in my eyes tilted our season. We need to be able to bring over a marquee signing really.

We don't have that and the gelling of certain players in positions is showing. However, I do have faith in Balotelli slotting them in once Sturridge returns, them two with Sterling behind them - as shown once this season vs Spurs.

1.) I can sit at 70-75 comfortably all day long, without the engine struggling. I took my 250 on a tour of Scotland and Wales and it felt like the piston was going to punch through the fuel tank above 60. I imagine a more modern 250 will fare better but 80 seems to be the upper limit, with 70 being just beyond the comfortable cruising speed.

2.) Acceleration, I can easily get past those annoying ""slow but not slow enough"" drivers on single carriageways with a flick of the wrist. My 250 is great at doing 0-30, but can't do 30-50 quickly. The 600 has enough poke at any speed.

3.) It's just bigger, I have more storage space, my pillion is comfy without adversely affecting performance and I'm not blown around on windy days.

Strictly speaking a 400 would have suited my needs perfectly, but there's not an awful lot of choice for bikes that capacity.

To counter a few other points people have made regarding speeding - no - we don't all speed, and certainly anything above 85 is asking for trouble, and remember that above 100 on the motorway is grounds for instant disqualification. I can't speak for others but I enjoy riding too much to throw it away for 6 months over a stupid momentary act. 

I personally never do more than 10% over the speed limit, bar one dual carriageway on my commute that changes from 40 to 30 for a mile for no discernible reason.

2. Usually plastic pouches or smaller quantities in paper/foil wrapped although I think you could still buy it in tins. Not sure about that. I think it might have pretty much stopped by then. Certainly all the stuff I was buying was in pouches.
3. Roll up: Old Holborn (check spelling on that if you're going to use it) was very common, I preferred Three Castles which was a bit harder to find but had a more mellow taste.
Pre-rolled: John Player Specials, Marlboro, Rothmans come to mind. Lambert &amp; Butler possibly? Or was that later? Not sure if Silk Cut had arrived by then. Again think that might be later.

false,Mhoeb,1972crest,,"Yeah, this is a fantastic point. As ball-bustingly frustrating as today's draw was, I think at times we don't take into consideration how utterly decimated we've been by crucial injuries in the first half of this season. I'd venture a guess that our core spine of vinny-yaya-silva-kun have been on the field together for maybe half of our matches so far? Possibly less? And as much as I'd like to say that this makes me optimistic for the second half of the season, the cynic in me tends to think that this may just be a feature of this squad, especially losing yaya to afcon.

I'd love to be able to confidently say that come February or March our squad will be at full fitness for a title push, but history gives me no reason to harbor any such illusions. Mangala wasn't really brought in to dominate big english center forwards right away, but the nature of this squad is such that players are always being forced into situations they're not necessarily suited for. I mean, we're a world class club who's been playing fucking JM7 at striker. I'm not sure if the problem lies with the training staff or with this batch of players or with luck, but its a problem that I really don't foresee going away. 

By no means does this suggest that we can't win the title, i think we proved as much last year playing without kun for a majority of the season, but it means that when I see a performance like Mangala's today, where a player appears unprepared or over-matched, a part of me feels like I just kind of have to accept it a product of one of our weaknesses as a club right now.

We may not have a defensive pair at CB to dominate English forwards. Mangala seems to chase a yellow card every match and if that's because he's trying to assert dominance or not I don't know. However he can be far too eager and brought out of position which leaves one Martin Demichelis exposed. Today Kolarov was woeful which makes us look a little worse than we usually are, but this is a team so they should be analysed together and in all circumstances. Anyway, despite Mangala and Demichelis, didn't we bring in Fernando to help our defensive game? I can't help but feel a back 4 of Kolarov, Mangala, Demichelis and Zabaleta should be dominating Burnleys attack. I'm probably going off point a bit - I'm on mobile so I can't see your comment - but I do feel our defence is our weakest attribute...

...apart from the fact we have no fit first team strikers. Jovetic plays in a 2 striker system. That's fine, every player has their preferences, but then his partners are dzeko and Aguero. Two players who are known to suffer from injuries. How the fuck we looked beyond this in the summer window is beyond me. Let's look at Chelsea (I hate Chelsea but who better as an example than top of the league?); they play with one striker yet have Drogba and Remy on the bench for when Costa is injured. That's 2 strikers who would start for any EPL team. Dzeko has his on and off days; I'd never bet on him to score. Aguero is phenomenal when he's fit but we can't count on 1 striker to carry us to win the league. But wait, we have a team of pure quality right?

Yaya Toure. I still don't know where I stand with him this season. Signs of brilliance yet the words lazy, slow, arrogant, all come to mind when I think of him. He doesn't track back as much as I'd expect a world class CM to, he hasn't shown any of them steam train runs we saw last season and he's been rather arrogant throughout this campaign. Yet he scores, assists and does do enough to make his way into the team each weekend. He's off to AFCON soon and I hope it's the time Fernandinho steps his game up and plays the games of his life. Lampard will offer alternatives for rotation but it's a temporary solution. 

With a fully fit and in form spine - Hart, Vinny, Yaya, Silva, Aguero - plus Zaba, Nasri, Navas, Fernandinho, Clichy, Mangala (on his day) we are a team that could beat anybody on the day. But we can't keep everybody fit, we do make silly mistakes, and despite the quality we're still lacking that extra 5% to make us a top 5 international team.

If it's from older acne unfortunately PIE can be fairly difficult to treat. Your best chance is likely with healing/ soothing/ calming type actives. Some are reporting success with some of the Asian products containing snail mucin or fermented extracts. If you are interested in this route check out /r/Asianbeauty/

You can also try with ingredients known to thicken the skin, strengthen capillaries, encourage collagen to deposit and remodel - so in some ways similar to a rosacea regime. Ingredients like vitamin C (there are several forms), encapsulated retinol - see [our ingredients Wiki] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients) - maybe ginkgo biloba and/ or phytomenadione (vitamin K).

It never does any harm to review your diet and lifestyle, ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. This means your skin has everything it needs for healing and collagen remodelling (wound repair actually takes months).

&gt;Close Encounter With a Dalek - Doctor Who - The Waters of Mars - BBC
&gt;The Tenth Doctor consoles Adelaide Brooke, telling her about her role in human history; even the Daleks don't dare tamper the fixed points. (TV: *The Waters of Mars*)
&gt;__Fixed points in time__ were moments in the space-time continuum at which events were set in stone and could never, *ever* be changed, no matter what. The Time Lords knew which points in time were ""fixed"", which the Ninth Doctor said was a maddening experience to have to go through. (TV: *The Parting of the Ways*) This was called ""the burden of the Time Lords"" by the Tenth Doctor, who was trying to explain to Donna why he couldn't prevent Mount Vesuvius from erupting or save the people of Pompeii. (TV: *The Fires of Pompeii*)

false,Cerdo_Imperialista,null,null,"These answers are based on my personal experience as someone who took up smoking in the 80s:

1. On the whole I would say that regular, pre-rolled cigarettes were more common. Rolling tobacco was cheaper, so that's what you would buy if you were hard up, but it gave you tobacco stains on your fingers. Most cigarettes were sold in packs of 10 or 20, and many off licences also sold single cigarettes (illegally, of course), if you couldn't afford a whole pack.

2. The most common brand I remember was Golden Virginia, and it was sold in a kind of foil-and-paper pack. Tins for rolling tobacco were pretty much a thing of the past by then, I think.

3. Silk Cut (mild tobacco) and Benson &amp; Hedges (more flavour) were the ubiquitous 80s brands. Cheaper brands were Lambert &amp; Butler and John Player Special, which I would have regarded as ""old-people"" cigarettes. Of course Marlboro and Camel were popular brands too.

4. I'm hazy on the price, but I seem to remember paying around £2 for a full pack of 20 cigarettes. This would have been around mid-to-late 1980s - the price went up and up throughout the decade because of a government policy of increases in the taxes on tobacco.

5. &amp; 6. I haven't lived in the UK for 20 years, so I'm not especially au fait with the tobacco products they sell there now, but I wouldn't imagine there's any huge difference, except maybe in the range (there were no mentholated Marlboros back in my day).

Going into a match the vast majority of commentators will try and create a story for the match. We lose to a big team? Its Spurs doing the same thing they always do. We fail to beat a worse team? Spurs were abysmal and need to change everything. We beat a worse team unconvincingly? Well, we're not actually challenging in which case it would have been ""the mark of a great side"" so therefore we were lucky and still need to change everything.

It's not so much bias, as it is just general laziness. Commentators very clearly don't watch much more than extended highlights, if even that, of team's previous matches before a game. They then go out and deliver a commentary job that fits the interests and viewpoint of the vast majority of PL fans who watch their teams games, the big games of the season that are on sky, and match of the day's highlights.

You'd probably get some interest from the more salubrious establishments especially in high traffic areas like London. Think LateRooms, only for restaurant bookings. 

Restaurants ensure they get some cash for centralized offloading of cancelled/unbooked space that is booked through your site, customer gets a discount on their bill (if they turn up), and you get a 1% cut (or whatever). 

No Bitcoin required or legally dubious offloading of reservations b. You'd probably make a fortune.

false,michaelisnotginger,null,null,"**Why Everton are going astray**

**1. Injuries**

Obviously this is going to be an excuse and you would expect halfway through the season this to have remedied itself. However the nature of the injuries has been very staggered. As soon as one player has come back, another is injured which has led to a disjointed nature of the team. As soon as Barkley was fit, Mirallas was injured. When Coleman was fit to return, Stones was out. Barry and McCarthy have been injured by turns, Lukaku is playing through an injury. Literally the only positive has been Kone coming through and playing well in the last few games. This has mean the team has chopped and changed multiple times (Tony Hibbert at LB for crying out loud vs. West Ham). Compare it to last season where the team picked itself other than a few changes on the wings and the CAM role. This is compounded by:

**2. Wingers - what are they good for**

It doesn't take a fool to notice Everton are as wide as your average Vogue model. What wingers they have are haphazard (McGeady) over-the-hill (Pienaar) or cack (Atsu) - Mirallas the honourable exception. This has led to multiple central players - Barkley, Eto'o, Naismith - parked out wide. While Naismith is good at harrying and closing a flank down, this has stymied the roles of the full backs and meant all attacks are going through the centre and a partially fit ageing Barry. Teams have sussed this as Sam Allardyce is mentioning earlier by applying a lot of pressure to the CBs and Barry to limit the full backs even further and force back-passes to the keeper. This is not helped by the fact that:

**3. The lower* teams are playing much better this season**

*Lower as in usually lower, cause they're not now

Last season every team below the top 7 had an appalling run at some point - even Southampton, who I think went winless in 9 or something. This time last year Sam Allardyce was favourite to be sacked, there were huge questions over Mark Hughes at Stoke, and Swansea had their typical Europa league hangover. They have remedied it this season each using a formula we employed last season - two hardworking defensive midfielders pinging balls all over the place and breaking up play, a floaty 'no.10' sort in front sending balls through to a big man. In Allardyce's case if this fails they can wheel out the medieval siege tower that is Andy Carroll. Teams have looked at what Martinez did and adapted it and their lack of Europa has meant they are fitter to play the pressing game more effectively. However this is no excuse for

**4. Lack of intensity**

A high possession 4-2-3-1 as practised by Martinez is dominated by pressurising the ball, harrying opponents and then moving quickly with the ball. Players like McCarthy and Stones who can play out from the back are instrumental at quickly ensuring it gets to the flanks and counter-attacks break down. however there has been poor intensity this season. Every time Everton lose possession (and there are a lot of poor passes) they look likely to concede. Moreover their slow build up wastes players like Lukaku's strengths and pace. A tactical change is needed.

**5. Mental fragility**

**1. Transfers**

Maybe this is impossible now but ideally what is necessary is a new pacy left-sided winger and a ball playing centre back - probably a holding player in January and someone like Deulofeu or Konopylanka (excuse spelling). Longer term slowly moving out the Moyes-era players such as Distin and Pienaar is necessary and finding a worthy rival to Howard or making sure Robles gets a skate on.

**Work on tactical flexibility**

The advantage of 4-2-3-1 is that it is very useful. It can become a 4-5-1, a 4-2-4 or even a 3-4-3 depending on how it is implemented. However. Teams outside the top 4 know how to play. Stick 2 banks of 4 defending deep and wait for Everton to slowly build possession, then counter attack. Or wait for an error of which there have been TEN this season. unacceptable. I know Martinez has a lot to answer for but he cannot be blamed for sending players out to do that. The answer is something that provides bodies in midfield - Everton are consistently overrun in midfield and there is still little if any solidity there. Meanwhile using Eto'o, Naismtih or Kone to feed Lukaku only seems possible if Barkley starts from deeper in midfield as when he plays in the no.10 position he seems to stand off more. The barkley/besic combination worked well and I think with McCarthy that's a midfield trio that could dominate.

The full backs, Baines and Coleman, have always been solid if not outstanding defensively, their real strength comes in their attacking contributions, but they've been caught out of position a few times as they try and get forward to support an attack that breaks down because we can't hold the ball in midfield.

Howard has been having a poor season after being excellent last season. I don't really know why, maybe it's age, although it shouldn't be.

The main concern is in central defence, where Distin, who has formerly been really good for us, has been in very poor form all season. John Stones has probably been our most impressive centre back but we can't seem to get him fit. Alcaraz has played well at times but he can't stay fit and Jagielka hasn't been in great form and has suffered from injuries too. What we really need is Jagielka and Stones to get a clear run without injuries and give us some stability in defence. Then, perhaps the rest will come, but I don't know.

Generally, though, most problems are stemming from a lack of confidence - losing the ball while trying to play out from the back, panicky decision making - and a lack of stability due to injuries hasn't helped.",0,1419814654,null,0,false,0,cn7v3dz,t3_2qnv3u,t1_cn7v3dz,t3_2qnv3u,null,1425174358,-2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,-2

I could understand the ref making a no call there, but the fact that he booked Cesc is what got me angry. He didn't miss the call; he got it completely wrong, you know the exact opposite of what happened. 

You're right that we shouldn't blame the ref for that one call when we had 30+ minutes to go ahead after that, but honestly I was getting frustrated the whole match with him calling a foul every time someone on either team was touched. It disrupts the flow of the game. I thought it was a bad refereeing performance overall with one major blunder. 

I don't have to go ref a game to see how hard it is because that is not my job; PL refs are professionals and while they are not perfect, they should be held to a higher standard than what was provided today. Again, a no call is understandable; sometimes you can't be sure there was a foul (especially in the box). That's not what happened though. He did make a call; he was sure that Cesc simulated the foul which was the opposite of what happened. Unacceptable. Add that to how slippery the pitch looked out there with players losing their footing multiple times in the box (obviously not the ref's fault) and it was just a frustrating match to watch. Get off your high horse man. No one here is being uncivil or unreasonably angry; it was a major talking point in the match and Jose is right when he says that even if it wasn't a dive, the perception that Chelsea players dive lives on which is frustrating and could have a major effect on our season at some point.

I don't believe it'd be too much of an issue in terms of finding a basic job (pub, fast food restaurant etc), but your time scale of finding work in 2-3 weeks may be optimistic. Make sure you have stuff prepared before you get to England- stuff like having a CV in English ready, having contact information for references (ideally who can speak some English) and an interview suit (shirt, tie etc.). The job market is competitive, so you will give out a lot of CVs, and you will apply for a lot of jobs you hear nothing from. The more you can be ready when someone does call, the better.

You may not dream of moving into a place with four other people, but it'll take down the cost quite a bit for someone starting out.

For comparison, if you are looking for your own place, or a place for you and your girl, I would probably be looking to bring a bit more than that- with (for example) £400/month as rent, you'll probably pay 1.5 months deposit (£600) at the start as well, plus agency fees and other setup fees.

10. Newcastle United 0-6 Liverpool. Unless I'm missing one (Brighton?) I think this was the biggest victory I've seen, and coming right after the Suarez ban made it even more enchanting!

9. Glen Johnson's winner against Chelsea in Fall 2011. One of the first late winners I'd seen, particularly against an opponent of Chelsea's caliber!

8. Suarez's hattrick of hattricks against Norwich. Quite amazing :)

7. Manchester United 0-3 Liverpool. First time I'd seen us thoroughly beat them, and boy it felt good!

6. Liverpool 3-2 Manchester City. Really believed after Coutinhoooooo! And dat Gerrard speech too, my word.

5. Liverpool 1-0 Stoke, August 2013. Call me crazy, most of the match wasn't even that great, but damn if I didn't believe we exorcised our demons with that penalty save.

4. Gerrard 3-0 Everton. I hadn't the pleasure of seeing Stevie in his prime, and after a season of him struggling with injury, this was the closest I think I'll get. Wonderful match!

3. 2012 Carling Cup. Only cup win I've seen since I started supporting, it felt absolutely marvelous.

2. This seasons pre-season match against Manchester City. Third time seeing LFC (other two were Fenway games) and went nuts when I thought Sterling clinched it right at the end!

The only thing I think they got wrong is where they went, they went to what was always going to be a massively nationalist part of Argentina, as they repeatedly said, it's where the Belgrano sailed from. How many families of those who died still live there? If your family members have been killed while doing something you believe was just you're always going to be angry. The sinking of the Belgrano was controversial here, imagine what was thought of it in Argentina. I'm not getting into the rights and wrongs of this but I can't believe this wasn't predictable and known. They should not have gone there, it put their crew in danger. That doesn't make what happened ok as I'll come onto in a second.

The mob that attacked them are basically the Argentinian EDL. There are parts of the UK I wouldn't try to build a mosque in for a laugh, that is what this part of Argentina is like. I've seen others saying that this mob were state sponsored, the state sponsored body here were the Police. If you look at Google Maps there was no other route they could take them, the best they could do was to get them out as quickly as possible. The state acted to help them. Yes the state also thinks the Falkland Islands are theirs and runs a huge campaign on this. Our state ran vans around parts of England telling immigrants we were coming for them and that they should leave. If this group are state sponsored then the EDL are. The state also granted visas and almost certainly permits for the Top Gear trip. They would not plan this as it has made them look terrible and harmed their case. I doubt we'll see any non Argentinian celebrities coming out and saying we should give the islands back in the near future.

To anyone who thinks we don't have people like this in the country we do. Every country does, whether they are football casuals, nationalists or whatever label you put on them we all have a violent minority. The vast majority of Argentina treated the Top Gear folk with respect and friendship. It's a great shame that the whole country is being slated in this thread when the majority of it that we saw was a decent country like any other.

He actually played many great games for us. E.g, when we were playing teams like Rayo Vallecano or Deportivo he would be one of the first to start racking up the goals/assists.

Some companies, regardless of if you actually claim or not, will note a claim against you if you call them for advice whether to claim or not (something I highly disagree with) so try to get information without giving up your details.

Secondly, claiming will (probably) affect future insurance premiums, this will (probably) be decided in-house by each company but large claims will raise premiums (unless car insurance with protected no claims, under a certain set of rules for example) - small claims may be ignored by some companies but all will need to be declared for usually 5 years.

Again, depending on company, if you pay monthly by direct debit, they may force you to pay the final remaining payments before they will pay out.

Interestingly, if you're underinsured, a little known clause in most policies also means they will reduce any claim payout by the same percentage you are underinsured by.

Lastly, a claim will have no effect on your credit file which concentrates on account balances, on time and late payments (amongst other things but not claims).

It's in the governments best interest to distract the population with stupid shit like this so that they are not paying attention to the fact that the government is failing miserably.

The reason why so many people are behind the sentiment that Falklands are Argentinean is due to propaganda. I grew up believing that in 1981, the Falklands were peacefully populated by Argentineans and in 1982 it was invaded by the UK and hold ever since. This was not told explicitly to me, implicitly in the education I got as well as the propaganda I was surrounded while I lived there.

I got access to the internet in 1996 and it was very embarrassing when I discussed the matter with people from other places to discover how wrong my believes were. And then I was outraged... I was outraged at the government, the educational system, the fucking propaganda.

The Falklands war was started by Argentina because of a military government that was failing and needed to have a cause... to instigate nationalism. Thankfully, since the war was a disaster for Argentina, it cause said military government to collapse and democracy to come back. The Falkland's war should be treated, in my opinion, the same way WW2 is treated in Germany: ""It was wrong, we had a crazy leader and we followed him, let's not do it again.""

I don't have strong sentiments for Argentina, it's not part of my identity, but it saddens me greatly to see this, probably just because I have both sides of the story so I can see it. Many here pointed it out how bad this is for Argentina because of the missed tourist and publicity of a beautiful place. And that's true. It's such a waste of resources to keep talking and arguing and having a conflict over a short war that happened 30 years ago. Even Serbia doesn't have this issue and that conflict was way worse.

This continuation of the conflict doesn't help the Argentineans in the UK, the British in Argentina, industry, etc. I am hopeful it will slow down because now, with a globally connected internet, people like me can learn the truth about what happened there and people like you, britons, can learn the truth about what's happening there: education and propaganda.

That doesn't mean I didn't believe Clarkson's story about how the Porsche 928 has a special place in his heart (because it allowed him to get to Sheffield to see his dad just before he died) but this was a convenient BACKSTORY tacked on afterwards to act as decoy to the real reason why the car was chosen.

You can overpay pay more than 10% if you are now out of your fixed period, unless your product features what is called an Early Repayment Charge Overhang where your ERC ends, for example, in 2017 but your fixed rate ends in 2015.  Unless you're adept at reading mortgage offers I'd call your lender and see if the ERCs have ended (meaning no maximum overpayments).

Don't forget to keep some savings topped up while you can afford to - overpaying is great but once it's paid in, it can't be taken back out (possibly temporarily reduced, if your product allows underpayments/payment holidays).",0,1419821670,null,0,false,0,cn7yfo3,t3_2pe4ur,t1_cn7yfo3,t3_2pe4ur,null,1425172729,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

* The plot isn't centric on the Doctor,  but he is present and is known about. His information on DVD/VHS helps the main characters save their lives. His methods indicate that he is a very clever man to think of his dialogue in such a way (predicting their responses to what he's said.) Addendum - this may be due to the folder that Sally gives him upon meeting him.

* The TARDIS is a machine that is clearly important, powerful, and can perform a variety of functions. I think this is the only time we see it travel and leave individuals behind. 

* We also see the Doctor's planning on having the Angels surround the TARDIS only to trick them into quantum locking themselves. 

* You, the viewer are in the episode. Keep in mind, a lot of the times when the Angels move, it's because *our* view of them is blocked. This is the only episode that does this. 

* Within minutes, the most painful flirtationship (between the cop and Sally) is established and destroyed. Not only was he sent back to when it was even *more* difficult to be an black male, but he remembered his few lines of conversation with her and held onto them. Do you remember what you said to your first crush x-amount of years ago, in the best condition? Me either.

2. It came in tins and plastic bags and little blocks, wrapped in paper (a bit like soap)



3. Golden Virginia and Drum rolling tobacco.  SilkCut, B&amp;H, Rothmans, JPS Black, Marlboro. Camel  Don't remember any others at the mo.



4. I don't know how much loose tobacco was, but it would have been pretty cheap.  I do remember getting 10 SilkCut, a box of matches and a packet of chewing gum and getting change from £1.



5.  They didn't really.  The packaging was different.  Tobacco companies were stopped from advertising in magazines and on tv, but I don't remember when exactly.  Packets had a small warning from the Chief Medical Officer, whereas these days we have gruesome pictures of rotting teeth, or blackened lungs on one side of the pack and SMOKERS DIE YOUNGER on the otherside (or someother cheery epithet.)



6. People didn't use filters, they may have used a cardboard roach if making a joint.  The choices of paper weight/size were more limited.

7.  Pipes, bongs, chillums, you name it, it was there.



I hope this is of some help.

It wasn't a worldwide phenomena yet.

I was still a pretty new fan to Liverpool and the sport at this time, so I didn't get to see Istanbul or Gerrard's legendary screamers.  This was back in the days where if you wanted to watch soccer you either had to watch via a shitty Russian stream or download the match and watch several hours after it happened.  This was the first goal I had ever seen that actually made me jump out of bed and scream!  Babel struck it so beautifully as it sailed past a young Loris.  This was the moment that really solidified my love for Liverpool.  I can't think of moments in other sports where I was so energized and my heart was racing so fast then that moment.  Babel may be a goof with tons of lost potential, but he is still one of my favorite players just because of this moment and how it turned me into a true fan.

so teams have figured that they can pressure our centerbacks, and park the bus vs our slow buildups [this](http://imgur.com/boh0z7b) is how we build up right now, [here](http://imgur.com/VAJ0hNi) is a tactical view, as you can see, players are marked tightly, and nobody has much space when they get on the ball, and moreover by dropping a DM deep we are taking players out of the middle, all in the name of pushing Baines and Coleman up the field. We should however take advantage of the space they leave in the middle when they pressure us, by keeping Baines and Coleman further back when we build from the back, and putting our midfielder in midfield where he belongs. the opposition would have to either pressure all four defenders like [so](http://imgur.com/H5JwfSr), leaving space to ping in long balls to our central midfielders who can hopefully turn and find space for a fast attacking build-up. The type of attack where lukaku can get a ball on the run, not with his back to goal. when pressuring all four defenders turns out not to work, and they realize that they need to sit back, and defend the long ball like [so](http://imgur.com/H2b4jhF), Coleman and Baines can run at the defence, hopefully, once again launching fast build ups.

&gt;But in all seriousness, ""telling like it is"" was a nice change from the political speak managers usually indulge in. 

Yeah, from time to time, I agree. But i don't think a manager can get away with that week in, week out unless you got the walk to pair the talk. I.e. Jose Mourinho.

&gt;Holtby huh? If he's so good, why the loan spells? Also, you like his behaviour off the pitch? Didn't he get caught cheating on his girlfriend in social media or some guff? Not that I care about that. I like him too. He seems right up Poch's alley. Similar player to Mason in energy with a bit more skill. Maybe he'll be back in January but I haven't heard a whisper about it. 

As a footballer, I rate him very highly because of his can do and relentless never give up attitude. Yes, it's true he may need to be conditioned a bit in terms of defending, but at least he tries. He will run and run. He's a fan favourite already as the chants at Ledley's testimonial roared ""We want you to stay, Lewis Holtby, we want you to stay."" So maybe I share this opinion. 

Whether he cheated or not, I don't know. I generally watch what he does on the pitch, and what how friendly he is off. I think that's a private matter that the public has no say in. His appearances on Google Hangout chats, Spurs TV, post match interviews and social media posta about Spurs (despite being on loan) show that he clearly is passionate about being at Spurs. 

As for the loans, I couldn't answer that. I am a little surprised tbh. Maybe he lacks discipline in some aspect of his game.
