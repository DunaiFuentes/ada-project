However, I am serious here, I personally don't get how F1 can be considered a sport. We can all mock golf, darts, bowling, etc as not being real sports because a morbidly obese person can excel at it, and that it requires barely any movement at all. But you can't deny that however unathletic those sports may be, at the very least, they are 'sport' in the sense that participants compete only on ability. With F1, the quality of the cars is a larger factor than differences between the drivers' abilities. To my eyes, that is a mockery of the very essence of sport - competition. 

And another thing that gripes me about F1 (and motorsport in general) is that as a 'team' sport, it is rather very individualistic, in the sense that it relies so much on just the two drivers out of a team supposedly made up of 100s of people.

They dumped him because Alex wanted Brazillian CBs with him, which is why they bought Silva. They didn't buy Marquinhos until after Sakho left. 

Sakho (24) had more ligue 1 appearances than Alex (22) and Silva (22) in his final year at PSG. That season Sakho averaged a 91.6% pass completion rate with 4.7 long balls per game, Alex had a 92.1% with 2.7 long balls a game. Dude can pass. His defensive stats were also very similar to Alex's.  1.2 tackles per game for Alex, 1.1 for Sakho. Alex had a better interception per game stat at 2.3 vs Sakho's 1.7. 

And I'm not sure what their system is, but I don't think France gives out the captain's armband like candy. He's not the everyday captain, but for a 24 year old to be given the captaincy for a couple of games shows that he's not a scrub who relies on a good team around him.

I prefer when people here choose to identify as Irish or British (or both) because these are realistic, long-standing, historically viable nationalities.

That's called political irresponsibility where I come from, and you (like many UKIP supporters) seem to see it as a positive attribute!

However to me, he is a homophobic, racist, overweight and extremely ugly cunt, flapping that big hole in his face about, making guttural noises for all he is worth to impress nobody but other homophobic, racist, overweight and extremely ugly cunts 

I'm really not sorry if that offends you, I just say it as I see it, (if he hadn't acted that way ,I really couldn't say it that way)...

UKIP don't offer any alternative, **at all**.

They are simply a slightly different variety of ""preserving the status quo between Govt and their banker/corporate masters"".


I'd welcome you being able to refute that last assertion too, but UKIP haven't said *anything like* that they will restore a fair and equitable tax system, nor have they said they will act against the graft that infects the festering rats' nest of corruption that Westminster, Whitehall, and the City of London have become.

£20 still doesn't sound like a huge amount, though. So compare prices for common goods - for example, a loaf of sliced white bread cost about 5p in 1960 - or about 2% of a pound. Today a loaf of bread costs about £1.35, which is 6.75% of £20. This is a consequence of food prices (a basic metric for calculating cost of living) rising higher than inflation. £1 in 1960 could buy you a lot more bread than £20 can in 2014.

Whilst Swansea are no pushovers and Villa are our bogey team there's a little run of Burnley, Swansea, Leicester, Afc Wimbledon, Sunderland, Aston Villa over the course of about a month coming up. There's your chance to get going, especially if there are new signings or a Christmas Sturridge to add into the mix.

&gt;I think 6th place will see off Rodgers.

Disagree here. I think at this point 6th would show that we got going in the 2nd half of the season and made a good recovery. What I think would get Rodgers sacked would be finishing up worse off than his first season here. That would very clearly be a big step back and not just stalling.

We're currently in the same competitions we were in when Brendan took over, so a direct comparison is rather easy.

In 2012/13:

Premier League: 7th, 61 points

I get the point about the quality of the car making a difference, but I don't see how that means it's not a sport. Horse racing is considered a sport (and AP McCoy won SPOTY a few years ago), and that relies on the horses.

But you seem to contradict yourself. You say it relies massively on the cars (and the team who design and build them), but then say ""it relies so much on just the two drivers"". There's perhaps one other driver in the world you could have dropped into that W05 to achieve the same result: Alonso.

Regardless, there was huge competition this year from Hamilton's teammate in the same car. In fact, we can look to the Bahrain GP as an example of Hamilton actually being in a worse car (due to harder-compound tyres) yet still winning. Watch that race and tell me that Hamilton isn't a tenacious, competitive personality who is also very talented. F1 is not, and has never been, just about speed; it's not a drag race. It's about tactics and logic, knowing when to push and when to hold, knowing your opponent, his strengths and weaknesses and how that compares to your own, complete awareness of every part of your car and how that relates to the people around you. It's about those instinctive dabs of the throttle and brake to just bring that rear-end round the apex, that intuitive feel for grip and spotting it earlier than your opponent, knowing the layout of the track and various zones to the tiniest details, being able to physically withstand the G-forces involved. Sure, a better car makes some of those things easier, but it can also be more difficult physically and mentally. Hamilton spun a fair few times in practice sessions, but he never spun in the same place twice, because the first time just confirmed the absolute limits of the car at that point of the track.

Sorry, got a bit carried away there, but I love and enjoy this sport (and Hamilton).",0,1418604236,null,0,false,0,cmv1111,t3_2pas6m,t1_cmv1111,t1_cmuzf66,null,1425431474,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I'd have a starting midfield diamond of Lucas, Hendo, Can, Gerrard and then play Sterling off of either Balo or Lambert. That should be a physically dominant midfield that allows Gerrard to do his business up top. Alternatively, keep Gerrard back a bit at standard CM (not a deep position, though) alongside Hendo and put Lallana in for Can in a standard 4-3-3.

Then, in the second half, bring on Coutinho for Gerrard (assuming he'll be tired from playing multiple matches in a row, otherwise he can stay on and maybe drop to replace Lucas if we are pushing for an equalizer while Coutinho takes over his 10 role). Bring on Markovic for either Can or Lallana or even Sterling if the boy is tired (let's face it, he looks gassed a lot of the time these days).

That still leaves you one more sub for injuries or defensive adjustments. If we need to control a lead at that point, bring on Allen to tick the ball over (he should only be starting if he's in a midfield trio including Lucas and Henderson or maybe Can who can physically boss).

For the sake of clarity and consistency, I also don't see horse racing as much of a sport, at least not anymore than F1, so that answers one of your points there. 

I don't think I've contradicted myself at all. I was pointing out two separate observations about F1 which I have always found quite farcical. One observation is that F1 sees itself as a 'team' sport, but each 'team' relies a ridiculous amount on their only two drivers - i.e. the 'team' would 100% fail if the two drivers put on a crap show, the rest of the 'team' can literally do nothing about it. The other observation deals with the issue of competition which is a separate matter. I have said that the results depend almost entirely on the performance difference between the cars, but that does not mean I see F1 as a team sport. A similar comparison would be to say that tennis is a team sport because players rely on their rackets which have been designed and made by workers in a factory - that is equally  bizarre. 

As I have mentioned before, I think F1 is more of an individual 'sport' than it is a team one, and I reckon most viewers have the same opinion as well. For example, you'll probably find more Hamilton fans than fans of the 'team' he currently drives for. In essence, the sport is polarized by support for the individual drivers rather than support for the teams.

false,Paramnesia1,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; The background staff make virtually zero difference to the result of the matches in sports like football, rugby, cricket and tennis.

I'd warrant that if you took away the physios, coaches, and everyone else involved with running a football club, the team wouldn't fare nearly as well.

&gt; I don't think I've contradicted myself at all. I was pointing out two separate observations about F1 which I have always found quite farcical. One observation is that F1 sees itself as a 'team' sport, but each 'team' relies a ridiculous amount on their only two drivers - i.e. the 'team' would 100% fail if the two drivers put on a crap show, the rest of the 'team' can literally do nothing about it. The other observation deals with the issue of competition which is a separate matter. I have said that the results depend almost entirely on the performance difference between the cars, but that does not mean I see F1 as a team sport. A similar comparison would be to say that tennis is a team sport because players rely on their rackets which have been designed and made by workers in a factory - that is equally bizarre.

Well then, it's a competition between the drivers not to put on a crap show. You can't say the team relies a ridiculous amount on its two drivers and then say the results depend almost entirely on the performance difference between the cars. By your own admission, the team relies on the driver to deliver the result in the car they provide. It takes the skill of the driver to extract that performance. This also ignores the input the driver has into the development and setup of the car.

&gt; As I have mentioned before, I think F1 is more of an individual 'sport' than it is a team one, and I reckon most viewers have the same opinion as well. For example, you'll probably find more Hamilton fans than fans of the 'team' he currently drives for. In essence, the sport is polarized by support for the individual drivers rather than support for the teams.

Now if it was common knowledge in the entertainment and music industries, then the security services were also *well aware* of exactly what he was doing...

If the security services knew, it is absolutely certain the Prime Minister shared their knowledge...

So why then did Maggie &amp; Denis have Jimmy-the-nonce-Savile over for Christmas (on I believe eleven separate occasions)?

---
&gt;
&gt;Four of the Doctor's companions were, from top left and in clockwise order: his granddaughter, Susan; Stockbridge science fiction fan, Izzy Sinclair; his first companion after the Last Great Time War, Rose Tyler; and the Second Doctor's most constant companion, Highland Scot, Jamie McCrimmon.
&gt;__Companions__ were the Doctor's closest friends. (AUDIO: *Situation Vacant*, *No Place Like Home*) Such people knew the Doctor's ""secret"": that he was someone non-human who travelled in time and space in a police box-shaped craft called the TARDIS.  They often directly saved his life (TV: *Rose*, *The Family of Blood*) or provided him with a perspective that prevented him from abusing his Time Lord powers. (TV: *School Reunion*, *The Runaway Bride*) On some occasions, they were the proximate reason that the Doctor sacrificed his then-current life and regenerated. (TV: *The Caves of Androzani*, *The Parting of the Ways*, *The End of Time*)  On others, they lost their lives in pursuit of the Doctor's goals. (TV: ""The Traitors"", ""The Destruction of Time"", *Earthshock*, *Voyage of the Damned*, AUDIO: *To the Death*)
&gt;Because the term was a shortening of the expression ""travelling companion"", most companions did in fact voyage with him in the TARDIS.  Depending on the situation, other words were used to describe the same relationship — most frequently, ""assistant"".  However, it was unusual to hear the Doctor call his friends by *either* word. Different incarnations had different preferences.  The Third Doctor, perhaps owing to his unique situation of exile, most frequently used the term ""assistant"".  (TV: *The Ambassadors of Death*, *Terror of the Autons*)  On the other hand, the Eighth Doctor — whilst running a competition to find a new companion — was forced to define the word *companion* and eschewed the term *assistant* in favour of *friend*. (AUDIO: *Situation Vacant*)

Allen did his job. Moreno and Coutinho did not.

I've read comments like ""if we buy a few top players in January (DM, GK, ST)"". Looking at the table at some of the teams above us and without belittling the teams:

*  West Ham
*  Southampton
*  Newscastle
*  Swansea

They don't have ""a few top players"", they have a team of players who play to a plan and they support each other. Something that Liverpool is not doing. Bringing in Reus, Yaya Toure and Jackson Martinez (for example) won't fix the fundamental problem which is the team chemistry.

false,UK_Prime_Minister,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I think your previous point is that football relies on people other than the players just like how F1 relies on people other than the drivers, therefore F1 is as valid a sport as football is. You've misunderstood me, that is not the reason why that I don't see F1 as a genuine sport. 

For a supposed team sport, I do think F1 relies far too much on an individual's performance. In football, if a player lazes around and barely touches the ball, it'll just be like playing with 10 men, the other guys will work a bit harder to compensate. In F1, if the driver is having an off day, his 'team' lose, end of story, nothing more can be done. Do you not see the difference here between F1 and virtually every other team sport? This is why I dispute categorising F1 as a team sport.

&gt;You can't say the team relies a ridiculous amount on its two drivers and then say the results depend almost entirely on the performance difference between the cars.

I am saying that there are two (separate) problems in F1:

a) It calls itself a 'team' sport, but it relies far too much on the individual driver as I've explained above. 

b) If we ignore the debate over whether its a team/individual sport (the above point), or maybe even let's assume its an individual sport between the drivers (how most people see it), there is the obvious problem that the performance difference between the cars has a significant impact on the result, arguably more so than the abilities of the drivers. In no other sport, will you have such a situation where technology pretty much determines the outcome rather than the ability of the players using them. Sport is about finding out who is the best performer on the day. That is simple not true in F1 where there are major differences in the performance of the cars available to each driver. Hence why I don't think F1 is a sport. 

Your point about requiring skill to extract the car's potential does not address any of those two problems.

Back in the day, it looked great for people who don't have a house, and who were having difficulty affording them, but if it becomes a continuing cycle of councils building houses for tenants to buy, then we've just turned local councils into construction companies - in competition with Barratt and Taylor-Wimpey, but probably also state-subsidised.

If you want people to be able to afford houses then the solution to that (IMO) is wealth equality, social mobility and affordable houses / mortgages.

If councils are building properties, the purpose of those should be social housing, IMO - those houses shouldn't be sold off, reducing the stock of homes available for councils to allocate to those in need.

I guess if the rules allowed councils to sell off houses at a rate no faster than they were building them (or at their discretion), then that would address that concern, but then it wouldn't be a *right* to buy any more. The ability to buy would then become a postcode lottery based on whether or not your council wanted to build more homes (actually, I think this could work very well).

/u/ezekielziggy says that right-to-buy has worked well in Singapore, but Singapore is a small island - their entire nation is less than half the size of urban London, so central planning of home building (apartment blocks, presumably) makes much more sense there. 

I would be in favour of much, *much* more social housing, myself - at the peak, in the 1970s, over a third of the British population lived in council houses. [[cite](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs)] They weren't just for scumbags or the unemployed - teachers and nurses lived on council estates alongside office and factory workers.

/u/ezekielziggy talks about having a stake as a benefit of home ownership, but back in the day a council house was for life, anyway; meanwhile he complains about NIMBYism, but NIMBYism is a product of home-ownership, because it's fuelled with concern about house prices. I believe I read a study recently comparing UK &amp; Germany that tends to confirm this.

The thing that's fundamentally important right now is that we need more houses - either for councils to dish them out to people or, if you believe in the free market, then to reduce prices, both for people buying and for those renting.

How you achieve more houses depends on your politics - it's an ideological issue whether you believe in unfettered property rights or if you think that the citizens should own the ""means of production"". I reckon there's an extremely wide range of solutions, all across the political spectrum, to current housing problems, but I don't think right-to-buy is one of them.

You should also remember that the present government is more concerned about avoiding a collapse in house prices than it is in affordable housing. ",0,1418612492,null,0,false,0,cmv5e82,t3_2p6csm,t1_cmv5e82,t1_cmuwpjr,null,1425429366,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

**Anyway**...

Back to talking about the show, but still on Brand. I don't think the show format suited him well. When asked a question, he would drift away from it because he had a more important point to make. You could see his frustration at how slowly everyone else was talking and at not being able to jump in and call people out on their bullshit. 

This restrictiveness is best shown when he mentions banker bonus' during a question about immigration, round of applause, then back to immigration. But then a member of the audience brings it back up. She literally asked, ""why aren't we talking about that?"", which was laughably followed by ""moving on, a question about the NHS"".

I think just by getting that information across, he succeeded in his reason for being there.

Talking about the NHS, i found this whole exchange very odd.

&gt;Farage: ""We as a party have decided that nhs must be free at point of care and the privatisation under labour has not been a success""

&gt;Dimbleby: So you stopped looking at insurance policies?

&gt;Farage: No, we had a debate. Nothing should be off the table.

&gt;Dimbleby: So its off the table now?

&gt;Farage: We will fight the general election saying, we think the outsourcing to private firms that we have seen under the last two governments has not delivered value for money or good health care.

That whole exchange was worded so carefully and precisely, the important part is what he didn't say. He didn't say under a ukip government, they would stop privatisation. ""We will fight the general election saying"" is basically admitting that they are adopting that popular stance, but after the election they will just do what they want. Most likely, more privatisation or maybe even insurance based health care. Everything on the table, right? 

Then of course, Brand made the important point that 71 MP's have a financial investment in privatisation, which was swiftly moved on from.

I liked how an audience member called the media out on focusing on the personality, not the issues. I was kind of annoyed Cavendish didn't say she would make any effort to change that, she just kind of agreed and then moved onto another point.

I also disliked how Cavendish said we should be proud of London. Its a city. You should have pride in yourself and people close to you, not places. Patriotism is pride for success you had no involvement in and shouldn't be encouraged. 

The woman at 31:10 who brought up Canterbury Prison saying it was full of immigrants is either a ukip shill or an idiot, most likely the latter. That prison has been shut since january 2013.

I was pleased that Mordaunt mentioned that immigrants are net contributors. A rare slither of truth that I wasn't expecting from anyone but Brand or Cavendish.

Creagh made me laugh a little, desperately trying to explain labours previous nhs privatisation before anyone could use it against her. Despite that, I liked and agreed with most of what she said. Since my voting choices are Green Party (basic income, green energy focus, unlikely to win) or a tactical Labour ""don't let the tories in"" vote, she convinced me that a Labour government might not be too bad.

48:48 - Mordaunt, after giving a bumbling excuse to the nurses/MP pay rise question, immediately jumped on the excuse he said he expected her to give. Which was bullshit, because it was the NHS Pay Review Body that recommended the 1% pay rise in the first place, which was then shut down by government's Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt. I also think Mordaunt's point about privatisation helping medical research doesn't really have any weight if these potential future scientific advances are being speed up at the expense of current real life patients and hospitals. 

Lastly, while I understand Farages point that grammar schools result in more financial success, the joy at which he advocated the resultant separation of classes and increasing of the wealth gap was sickening. I also didn't think he really contributed much the whole debate. Just the usual ""immigrants are the problem"" spiel at the start, then a few snide petty jabs here and there.

Why Fazio is caught so far out is what truly concerns me.

Vertonghen takes a caulculated risk in an attempt to stop the ball, fails, stumbles, and then when he stops he's actually in a position  to occupy some space and deny a rebound that Hugo may push straight back through the center of the box. I can't say he wasn't ball watching there or why he stopped in that space but he's actually in a great spot to clear a potential rebound.

My take. Fazio should have been there to be muscling Bony, Verts should have been where Fazio was as he actually has worthwhile legs under him. Vertonghen's risk doesn't pay off, Davies magically sweeps up.

At the top end, Russians stopped buying earlier in the year, but returned after the summer break.

There is obviously an issue with stamp duty-clearly hits market above the threshold but provides a small boost for lower value stuff.

Where there may be a problem is with buyers from oil countries,which have obviously seen a big fall in income.

Russian money is gone with sanctions and rubel's collapse. And it's not back as the data from Kensington and Chelsea and other prime London areas shows (they have been on minus for over half a year now, they're even on minus year on year). Oil rich money is gone as their own countries are starting to feel a sting due to oil price crash. Chinese money is gone as the Chinese have their own property price crash at home and are putting strong restrictions on capital outflow.

On top of that both major parties now see rich property owners as potential milking cows. (Stamp duty changes add mansion tax)

I'm expecting BTL landlords to be milked post election with a money short government. As they're an easy target that won't bring any voter sympathy when hit.

The party in prime central London is over. The question is, is the party in other market segments over as well already.

2. Show that I still fulfilled the requirements of my HSMP visa conditions (age/earnings/qualifications)

3. Prove that I have ""settled"" in the UK by spending no more than 180 days out of the UK in the 5 yr qualifying period.  If you've spent 180 days consecutively out of the UK, you're almost by default not going to get ILR and if you've gone over 180days in total, you *could* be ok as long as that  is paid annual leave.

I engaged the services of premiervisa.com and found them a great relief as they knew all the ins and outs.  Their fees were ok, but they were worth every cent to me.

Or go talk to someone from Chatham House to work out why the Arab Spring had such mixed outcomes? Since Brand has not apparently done any thinking at all about what a revolution would actually look like, I find him a very dangerous polemicist because he seems to want to reproduce the conditions that have historically given rise to civil war (although I can't say that for certain because Brand is so deeply unclear about exactly what model of anarchy-socialism he is advocating; it seems to change depending on what sort of questions he is being asked on any particular day).

I don't think anyone thinks Brand is broadly wrong in his general thesis, but I think he should take his position a lot more seriously.

Yes, but that's a completely different thing from saying that breastfeeding should be discouraged because of it.  I was merely stating a medical fact (namely, that feeding a baby isn't always as simple as putting milk in because it sometimes comes back out) but not drawing any conclusion from it.

I also drew the analogy that coughing or nose blowing produces ""waste"" and it would be equally preposterous to suggest that people can't cough or blow their nose in public for that reason.  

But that's not to say that baby sick, snot, or other bodily fluids are comparable in their grossness.  

Women are discreet when breast feeding and (most) people are discreet when blowing their noses.  It's no big deal.  The fact that bodily fluids/waste are involved is largely irrelevant.  

The whole argument about whether or not babies are sick, how much more sick they are on breast vs bottle, if that's comparable to snot, piss, poop, etc., is a distraction.  From where I'm standing, it appears to be a knee-jerk response from people who have jumped into this thread and assumed that I'm the ""enemy"" because I dared to share my personal experience of both breast and bottle feeding which involved me getting covered in baby puke on numerous occasions.  That's a fact of life - not an argument against breast feeding.

These conditions and others aren't automatic disqualifications, but they can lead to disqualification or limited qualification on examination.

High weight or body fat content can also lead to disqualification, because those conditions are frequently accompanied by enlarged organs, damage to some organs, and large amounts of useless tissue that only serves to make it difficult to remove the organs quickly and cleanly enough for transfer.

That's what I'm seeing atleast. Coutinho has been quite poor this season and I don't feel like he deserves to start in our PL games. This might not be his type of game but he needs to step up his game and he has the chance to do that in these ""smaller"" games. I hope we get to see Sakho play again as I feel like he has a good chance of pushing out Lovren or Skrtel, or maybe participating in a 3 man defense although that could potentially be catastrophic. It's going to be a physical game so I expect our midfield three of Can, Lucas and Allen has the potential to control the game.

I don't think it's really the hippies/crusties to blame.  Sure, they have the occasional protest about fracking, or driving a motorway through an old forest, and stuff like that.  From recollection, these things usually end with them being evicted by force and the government doing whatever they wanted to do in the first place (albeit with significant delays and huge cost to the taxpayer).

The NIMBYs are a more serious force to be reckoned with.  Unlike the crusties, they attract widespread support from people in all walks of life.  They can *REALLY* get things stopped because these groups typically include local councillors, politicians, etc., who can ""influence"" the process.  A new social housing estate on the outskirts of our posh country village?  Not a chance!

That's unlikely to be a goer for any debts in sole name, and lenders are likely to be reluctant for any joint debts too. For as long as the debts are joint the lenders have the joys of ""joint and several liability"", and their position would weaken significantly if half of the debt was placed solely under the responsibility of the unreliable party.

We have in place specific rules on this subreddit to try and stop people moralising, so I will pick my words carefully: It sounds as though your wife hasn't considered her side of the responsibilities. It is easy to blame a past partner, but credit cards were used (in her name), the joint finances failed, the bills were run up and she is legally responsible for the debts.

She has also waived her legal right to obtain CSA payments. It's a bit of a logical fallacy to claim there was no point because he probably wouldn't pay anyway - he definitely isn't paying anything toward the children now, so how would she be worse off? I do not know the legalities around CSA or whether it would be possible to claim retrospectively, but if it hasn't been time-barred it might be worth pursuing.

You mention there is a charge against the property - is this a second charge from a lender? This implies they either took out secured additional lending (Ocean finance-esque), or an unsecured debt was capitalised against the property. If this is the case, all the spare financial resources should be focused on repaying this, as it can prevent re-mortgages and so on going ahead.

From a mortgage point of view, it sounds like you may be looking at an ""equity buy-out"". Effectively you want him to be removed from the mortgage and you to be added. The first discussion to have is with the mortgage lender, to see what their policies are (you would be assessed as a replacement borrower). Chances are this will be popular with the lender, as they're removing a poor credit risk and replacing them with a (potentially) better credit risk.

The lender will probably require you to seek independent legal advice. This is probably sensible anyway, as you may be letting yourself in for some pain if one of your wife's creditors petitions her for bankruptcy.

false,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Not really. According to statistics only one in three households in the UK is mortgaged. And many of them aren't leveraged to the breaking point.

I am by no means an expert (and welcome corrections from people who know more about this), but I think the larger threat is to the banks.

When Joe Customer takes out a mortgage for, say £100k, the bank effectively creates the debt out of thin air.  It then becomes an asset to them - it's effectively a promise that Joe Customer will pay them £200k (including interest) over the next 20 years.  

The bank can then leverage that equity to give them up to £6.6 million to invest in the market.  The current regulations require them to have just 3% equity to cover their debts, so it effectively multiples their money by a factor of 33.

The end result is that the banks have trillions in debt, much of which is ""gambled"" on the original stake of Joe's mortgage.

Assuming you bought the HSBC FTSE All-Share Index tracker (though it's worth considering a more diversified approach - investing globally is likely to reduce volatility), you would be paying 0.17% PA within the fund for their services, resulting in a total cost of 0.56%.

The cheapest alternative that I can think of would be Charles Stanley Direct of Cavendish Direct, both of which charge 0.25% PA fees, and you could buy the Vanguard FTSE All-Share fund which I believe charge 0.08% PA. Total costs to you: 0.33%, which is 0.23% a year saving.

Using [Vanguard's costs ""ready reckoner""](https://www.vanguardlearning.co.uk/sites/default/files/additional-resources/SA_Ready%20Reckoner_Sept2012.pdf), if you invested for 20 years, the Charles Stanley account would be worth 5% more thanks to compounding.

It's not a huge difference, but it is a difference all the same.

That's the whole point though - that's not necessarily true.

I don't have a TVL as I don't have a TV etc. I receive threatening letters about every two months and I have had a few visits where they will break their own home visiting policies, such as by trying to get information from neighbours.

I recently had a visit from someone who claimed to be from Mori doing a survey about TV viewing habits. I am supposed to believe that my flat was chosen at random in the middle of the block and three floors up? 

You don't have to answer your door to uninvited strangers and you certainly don't have to give your name or other information. Whatever they say you do not have to let them in. 

If you decide to cooperate with their shenanigans anything you do say will be twisted around and used as evidence against you. That's how they get most convictions for TVL evasion. They will lie about the law and their rights, they have no more than I do. Which is none. They will ask you your name at the doorstep without identifying themselves because they need your name for a prosecution. They will ask your neighbours for your name too.

It is good to get to know your neighbours and in this case it was probably OK. Of course it could have been any type of distraction burglary attempt. You could have asked her what her door number was.

Don't let them make you paranoid, but also don't be fooled by their tricks.

EDIT: This post is being rapidly down-voted.
I had a message that I typed a response to. That message got deleted but so as not to waste my thoughts my carefully considered response is pasted below.

The letters are designed to frighten people. Many of whom are innocent of anything. These and home visits are also often bullying attempts to enter peoples homes by breaking published policies, claiming legal rights of access and misrepresenting the law. Thus taking advantage of peoples ignorance and willingness to submit to perceived authority to make money.

If you complain or communicate with them in any way you will have given them your name which they need to start a court case against you. After that they will misrepresent anything you say or tell barefaced lies to build a case against you.

If you know that you don't need a TVL don't entertain them. If you know you need one just get one.

I don't have a fishing licence but the Environmental Agency don't come searching for rods. I don't have a driving licence but Swansea don't come looking in my garage. I don't have a TVL because I don't have a TV, Sky etc but I don't have to prove it to anyone.

Yes, it is a problem when people dislike their neighbours based on little more than their ethnic origin. I've got Asians living next door and across the road. They really aren't that scary.

Well yeah there is ingenuity, but not from the driver. And as I've mentioned already, this is an individual 'sport' in all but name. Its true that there is a team of people who design and build the car, but they aren't part of the sporting event any more than the racket designers and shoe makers are part of the 'team' of Federer or Nadal when they're out competing. If you want to consider engineers as part of a team in a sport, do you define engineering activities in general as sport as well? 

You may find it fascinating not knowing if a talented driver can overcome the handicap of his inferior equipment to win against his opponents, but I just find that farcical as a competitive spectacle. Competition is distorted when participants aren't competing on a level playing field. In any other sport, the competition exists to find who is the best at an activity on the day. With F1, it tries to determine the 'best' at two separate things with one result, and you invariably end up with a result that gives you a mixed picture - Is Hamilton really the best driver?

That they are ramming down the kids throats a very different version of history than what is tough in the rest of the UK. It's not that it's factually incorrect it's that they are concentrate on pushing without context the history that stirs Scottish national pride and anti-English sentiment. 

Like i said i don't know how true the above is but when you look at the voting figures for the recent Scottish referendum. Well I can't remember the exact figures but something daft like 80 to 90 percent of 16 to 18 years old voted for independence. Maybe it's just a coincidence, it just doesn't sit right with me at all that the ruling party in Scotland that are setting the tone of the kids education are also polling incredibly high with 16 to 18 year olds.

I still have no idea what the facts really are given the situation.  The one bit of rhetoric I did find that I actually agreed with was rephrasing the question rather than England vs Scotland, was Scotland + England vs Scotland alone.

false,courtenayplacedrinks,null,null,"The episode starts with quick flashbacks of the Doctor and Clara in the Tardis: fights we've seen them have before, but from a new camera angle. At first we don't notice, but by the third flashback we realise there's something standing in the background, a Silence. A few more flashbacks and we begin to realise that each time Clara has had a uncharacteristic mood or dragged the Doctor away to do something, the Doctor had been working on the same thing: how to find Gallifrey.

Flash forward. Clara is no longer around and the Doctor again feels like there is a presence in the empty Tardis. He seems to see something in the corner of the room, walks towards it, then forgets, going back to what he was doing. He enters some coordinates and pilots the Tardis away.

We're in an empty library, we hear the grinding of the Tardis arriving but it's cloaked so we see nothing more than a strange distortion in the light. A shot from inside the Tardis looking over the Doctor's shoulder shows there's a spacesuit on the floor with a skeleton inside it. We have a short, echoy flashback of River saying ""hello sweetie"" and ""of course, you don't know me yet"" reminding us of his first time meeting her in the library.

The Doctor turns away from the library and goes back inside the Tardis. He looks up, startled.

""How did you get in here?"" he asks. He's discovered the Silence again. He keeps his eyes trained on the Silence and questions it about what why it's here. While he stares the silence down he picks up a blackboard and chalk and writes on it. At a critical moment in the dialogue he looks away and forgets everything.

Cut to later, as the Doctor's doing some mundane repairs. He discovers the blackboard and reads the word ""listen"" on it. He stands perfectly still and works out where the Silence is. He traps it in a force field in a chamber just outside the console room and talks to it without ever looking at it. He realises that if he doesn't look at it it can't wipe his memory. He works out that the Silence has been distracting him, preventing him from going to find Gallifrey. He realises that the solution to leaving the universe to find Gallifrey was obvious: he has all the equations scattered about. He had worked it out months ago, he'd just forgotten.

The Doctor rattles the controls on the console and pushes the Tardis out of the fabric of the universe, trusting it to lead him home. On the journey the Silence keeps pleading with the Doctor, asking him to turn back.

Instead of arriving at the Gallifrey universe, the Tardis is drawn toward to an earlier version of itself outside Amy Pond's house, in the universe that the exploding Tardis destroyed. It materialises in the same position as the other Tardis and the crash sets off the explosion that would ultimately destroy the universe. A crack appears in the wall of 12's Tardis and then a flashback of River trapped in a time loop as 11's Tardis explodes, tearing up the universe.

In 12's Tardis silence has fallen. The Doctor panics and pulls levers madly on the console, screaming obsenities behind the veil of silence as nothing seems to work. Time loops back and there is sound again, then the crash as the Tardises collide and then silence as the crack opens, except this time it's much larger. The Doctor repeats roughly the same sequence of panicked actions, although there is now an explosion blowing out of the crack and the Doctor's sonic screwdriver rolls away under the console.

Time repeats one more time. This time the crack is consuming half the console room and a wind is rushing in blowing everything away from the crack, the Doctor has to hold on to the console just to keep on his feet. He stares helplessly into the light of the crack and sees a figure comes falling through. River tumbles out of the crack, braces herself with a heel against the console, picks up the sonic and transports herself and the Doctor to the secondary console room. She pulls some levers that jettison the the main console room and set the Tardis adrift in the space between universes.

She throws the sonic to the Doctor as silence lifts. ""Hello, sweetie,"" she says. Next episode: Gallifrey

Even their own website which they can edit, is a shining example of how fucking boring and uninteresting they are. They scream censorship when there is nothing to be censored. You don't have to be controversial, but you do have to be interesting. 

It's actually quite an impressive achievement. At a time when we are still in economic trouble, when conflict and disease are very public around the world, when climate talks are going well in Lima, when the torture program report has just been released. How a political party manages to be boring at the moment is quite an achievement, but the Greens have found a way.

false,nefron55,flair1,,"As a preface, I want to say that I desperately want him to succeed. I like his attitude and think he has shown glimpses of prodigious skill. Having said that:

Can you source the claim that he assists or scores almost every game and that he has created the most goal scoring opportunities in our season this year?

From whoscored: He's made 4 assists in 16 premier league appearances and 0 in 5 EL appearances. He's scored no goals in his 16 premier league appearances and 2 in his 5 EL appearances. Thats a total of 4 assists in 19 games and 2 goals in 19 games. Not too hot. 

Regarding his 'improvement since last season': it's not that simple. Two seasons ago, he scored and assisted frequently at Roma and was called an heir to Totti. Last year was a train wreck. Injuries and an unsettled team hampered his time settling into our squad. So even making it onto the pitch this year would be an improvement. Really, he's still far below what he was at Roma and what we wanted him to be at Spurs. That said, yes, he has been better than last year--I'm just not sure that's saying much.

Additionally, the 'hate' for him is not because he's a show-off. It's because he consistently loses the ball. He receives it in a good attacking position, but frequently doesn't quite know what to do after he's run forward. He dribbles when he should pass, passes when he should dribble and neither of them come off so well.

That said, I want him to be given more Europa/Cup time to try to regain some of his earlier season form when he was assisting more frequently. He's a crucial part of our rotation whether or not anyone here likes it, but he should be given dropped into the cup squad for a while I feel.",0,1418641220,null,0,false,0,cmveugl,t3_2pcl7l,t1_cmveugl,t3_2pcl7l,null,1425424151,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

Bad debt will cause capital problems and might cause the bank to become overextended or even struggle to pay out deposits, but it does not cause more debt to become bad, unless we are talking about something like a factory going bust defaulting on their debt and then their employees defaulting on the mortgage, but that is a whole different story

The way its done is: 200k mortgage will be translated into risk weighted assets, in this case its liekly to be around 160k. That will be then used to calculated the required tier 1 capital holding against that debt. The ratio is between 12-15% for most bank (which can be higher than required under Basel III, subjected to banks own discretion) in this case the tier 1 capital requirement would be 24k.

The 3% that you mentioned is the reserve, but its the other side of the equation it is how much reserves you need to hold against deposits. (Those deposits still need capital to be used to fund lending).

So our example of 200k mortgage will require about 206k in deposits and 24k in capital.

Now holding capital is expensive, so banks need to be somewhat selective how they use it. Which is good and bad at the same time. For instance a bank might be cutting out smallest customers from one of their portfolios (its a tad complex why it makes sense, comes to the way the risk on those is modeled), which means that the bank will be safer (less exposure), but as a small client you will have fewer options.

Crappy sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking

Afterword: People vilify fractional reserve system, but think of the alternative. You bring your paycheck to the bank and are then charges for every single service and on top of that essentially get a negative interest rate. You might get better interest rate if you commit to term deposit, but if you have little money that doesnt matter. It could force the poorer part of the population out of the banking system.",0,1418641547,null,0,false,0,cmvewow,t3_2pb8f0,t1_cmvewow,t1_cmve5it,null,1425424123,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

And this is defined.... how exactly? You can score from [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NksLn_VUjlI) [positions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0r7wb1z0Sc). I also doubt that.

&gt;Yes, he a bit of a show-off, but that's what everyone used to say about Neymar. 

Neymar also produced, granted in a weaker league but he also made a considerable step up in his first year.

&gt;He has definitely been a much bigger asset than Soldado and unlike Soldado, Lamela has really improved since last season.

What's with the Soldado hate? Let him play and let's support him.

My criticism of Lamela so far (pasted from another thread):

1) Loses the ball too easily too often dribbling.

2) Bit too conservative playing the ball, he's quite defensive in that regard like he's afraid of losing it. For example coming a bit deeper, receiving the ball and playing it back immediately. Why do that? 

3)  Needs to turn out more to play it. Whether this is a combination of him, lack of calls from the team (being told you can turn) I don't know but it's common with a few others too.

4) Needs to look up a bit more, sometimes he misses runners and passes he can play.

5) He should try and take a few more risks when passing. Like a ball in behind, over the top, playing someone through. It's like he's possession focused and doesn't want to lose it, which is nice, but the best teams play that killer pass. For example [that](http://youtu.be/HshqlTSOcco?t=55s) Fabregas pass. Who the fuck tries that? Could've not done it but he did. Lamela needs to try and take some more risks. Yes, things won't come off but he is a good player, he's quite able to do more things than he's letting on.

6) Please, for the love of fuck learn to tackle. He lunges in and goes to ground far too often.

7) Needs to get stronger. He's quite lightweight at the moment and doing what he's trying to do (beat a man and hold him off, get in tackles) he really needs to get stronger. It'll take time but he can get there. He doesn't have to be [Elokobi](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/George_Elokobi_1.png) but he needs to put on a bit of muscle.

8) Needs to stay out wide more, drifts in far too often. Occasionally sure but if there's no width, you're easy to mark. Having 4 players all within the 18 yard box is a piece of cake to defend and we don't want that.

9) Work on that weak foot damnit. He tried a shot at Hull so I'm guessing he's working on it. Doesn't have to be Messi with both feet but being confident enough to play passes and the occasional shot/cross will be more than enough.",0,1418642005,null,0,false,0,cmvezrw,t3_2pcl7l,t1_cmvezrw,t3_2pcl7l,null,1425392210,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Negative Eugenics is when you actively intervene in the reproduction process. So if for example the government mandated that all people who were unemployed must have a vasectomy.

That would be Negative Eugenics.

This policy is the government saying they won't give child benefit for a 3rd child is using the welfare system to discourage people from having more than 2 children using money as a motivating factor.

The government is NOT preventing anyone from having a 3rd child with this policy. Just saying they won't give child benefit for it.

It's a population control policy, and there's certainly nothing wrong with a policy that aims to keep population in check though incentives. Essentially the government backing of the concept of ""marriage"" is the same idea. Promoting family structure to maintain a good birth rate.

If it were that simple then people wouldn't hold alternative views. Unfortunately in order to get more children out of poverty you need to incentivise reckless parents not to produce more children.

Westminster *is* corrupt from top to bottom and you seem (as far as can be established in this thread) to think (by the act of omission at least) that that is ""OK"", ""fine"", and ""dandy"".

And if it IS low-paid work, then you can still claim housing benefit etc. 

The fact is, not everyone is going to have an amazing job. This is life. Never-the-less, people should contribute, and where necessary their income is topped up. Benefits alone is not a productive form of income.

Not only is the league less aggressive than previously, but, many small framed players thrive (Silva, Modric, Eriksen, Hazard etc). All those players have great close ball control, as does Lamela - so I think he can make it in this league. 

As others have pointed out previously, his decision making leaves a lot to be desired, someone in another thread just said ""he passes when he should dribble, dribbles when he should pass"" and that sums him up perfectly. On top of that he drifts inside way to often and lacks the pace to stretch the opponent on that right side.

Personally I think he would thrive in a 4-3-3 that looks something like:

         Lamela - Bentaleb - Eriksen

          Lennon - Kane - Chadli

In saying that, I don't think Poch will move to a 4-3-3 nor do I think that setup is better than what we currently have.

Going forward, I would like to see Lamela work on his game in the non-league matches, perhaps promote Lennon for the time being. Unfortunately we are not strong at RM.

As for the other two thirds, the Trussell Trust say that most food bank visitors are one-time visitors and don't come back for repeat visits. 

That said, they do also say that the vast majority of people visiting food banks is because of delays in benefit payments, which is entirely the government's fault.

I hate that opinion. They were massive yes, and losing those goals has hurt us a lot. Hopfully Sturridges return in Jan can ease that a little. They were our whole front line for god sake obviously it's going to hurt us, the team was built to support them. 

Arsenal, Spurs (twice), Everton, United - these are four big clubs that our midfield absolutely bashed last year. We hear all this talk about Suarez and Sturridge but in these fixtures our entire midfield was absolutely incredible. Especially against Spurs and Arsenal - completely overran them nicking the ball,creating chance after chance. 

Our midfield against Arsenal was frightening and they had arguable the best midfield in the league at the time of the Anfield fixture. The argument that Suarez and Sturrige totally carried the team undermines what we did last season entirely. They were a great line in front of a great midfield last year, and one we are sorely missing. How many clear cuts did we create yesterday? I'd say 5/6 - offensively that's all a manager/coach can do, it's up to the players to put it in the back of the net and unfortunately we don't have that with Sturridge injured right now.

A cycle of council houses becoming owned houses and the funds going into building new houses would be a great way to get social mobility going for many people who weren't born into the opportunities others enjoy.

Evidently private companies alone, under the current conditions of planning laws, aren't sufficient to get enough houses on the market, and I don't think we'll ever be able to reform those laws sufficiently to eliminate that problem in a democratic society.

My personal concerns when it comes to the concept of ""social housing for life"" is that it splits society into two with little mobility in-between. Teachers and nurses might have lived on council estates, but they'll be forever separated from other teachers and nurses who were born into an already successful family, and before you know it a future government would do another Thatcher as it would be a massive vote-winner.

I find the solutions both on the left (lots of social housing for life) or the right (no social houses, deregulate to encourage more construction) will just lead to a massive class division, not to mention a generational one.

This is where I took those words from. 

Now, I don't expect everyone on the left to automatically side with Brand, but I expect there to be some agreement on the substance of what he says. 

Russell Brand called Farage a 'pound shop Enoch Powell', warning that he was someone we needed to be careful of. I don't think this went down badly with Guardian/Independent/Mirror readers. 

In his last appearance on QT, he demanded more accountability from the banking sector. As for the specifics of this, I would expect left-wingers to side with him over anything Camilla Cavendish or Gillian Tett would argue for. 

Russell is anti-TTIP and wants the NHS to stay as it is (public and free at the point of use). Those even on the centre-right have a different view on both. 

This is what I mean. Russell Brand presents left-wing views to a wide audience. Now, I know a lot of people don't like him. I didn't for a while, but he grew on me.

I'm curious what the threshold is where they might decline someone from ILR and settlement on an income basis. Not that I have any issues working currently.

Just for your interest, on the website for ancestry visas it states the limit of 180 days outside the country applies in any 12 months. It doesn't seem to give a total limit for the whole 5 years? May be different to the conditions of your visa of course.

If you choose the 80s, UK corporate profits suddenly shot up very high, because of a sudden massive growth in them in the city &amp; financial services (remember ""the big bang"").   So comparing that position to just after a major recession may not be a fair comparison - if you were to choose say the 70s, when corporate profits were low, you might get a different answer.

An alternative comparison might be to compare similar countries, and the % of tax they get from corporation tax.... Britain turns out to be about average for OECD developed countries - more than the USA, but also more than France &amp; Germany.  See: http://i.imgur.com/SeKP8Ue.png

&gt;Following from this, when we embark on policy messaging around immigration, which is not an area where Labour has the strongest lead over other parties, we should ensure that this messaging is always done in conjunction with other policy areas. The purpose of this is to raise the salience of those issues in which Labour has a much clearer lead and stands to benefit more from their prominence with the electorate.

tackles the problems people are worried about, whether they express those concerns through the prism of immigration or not.

(a) listen carefully to electors’ concerns on immigration on the doorstep and engage
with their views before moving the conversation on to how Labour would tackle
the issues they have raised (whether they be housing, education, the NHS, etc.).
We should acknowledge electors’ concerns and contextualise the problem as

The reality is that the Labour orders are about ensuring candidates don't fall into UKIP's trap of trying to force the campaign to be entirely about immigration. The moment the entire election is about immigration, they've lost because the absolutist position of UKIP wins over. For example, the guidelines state that candidates should listen to the public's views on immigration, but don't attack those views no matter how tempting it is.

Labour have policy proposals for tackling immigrations, but they don't want their entire campaign to be focussed on it.

Immigration is an important issue to a lot of people, but it is also issue wrought with misunderstandings and complexities that make any discussion on it difficult. For example, people against immigration tend to also be against all foreign aid. Yet that foreign aid will cut immigration in the long term - since if we make developing countries less shit, people living there will be less likely to want to emigrate... But people don't want something that works in the long term, they want something that works now (even though what works now is harmful in the long term).

And if not, than French people would also not have to get a visa to come to the UK. Same with all other countries. I've lived, studied, and worked abroad in a few different European countries now and it would have been a nightmare to get visas every time. 

Added to that are the massive extra financial burdens that would be incurred by moving abroad. Visa costs, extra administrative costs for renting, or setting up a bank account that currently don't cause problems, having to pay the massive fees if we decide to study abroad. The latter is particularly pertinent - right now, British students can study in Germany or the Netherlands for a tiny cost, while the Americans have to pay the full amount. This opens up higher education to far more Young British people, and helps us to broaden our horizons. Unless travel, and studying abroad, are to only be the preserve of the rich (which admittedly is probably Farage's view) then leaving the EU would be pretty terrible, even if it would still be technically possible to visit other countries. 

We're leaving aside too the fact that EU immigration simply does not harm the country, when compared to the benefits we get, and the fact that the Tory policy of draining resources upwards is ruining opportunities. People may feel they can't get a job because of immigration, but they haven't considered that low educational standards are simply not setting people up for work. When I was a bartender, I had to deal with a few customers who would complain that their waiter was Polish, and that their son couldn't get a job (only happened a couple of times, admittedly). When I asked about their son, it quickly turned out that he didn't have any work experience and had only applied to a couple of places.

The same reason some people consider VAT regressive, because poor people spend a larger proportion of their income on goods and services, than the rich.

Poorer people often spend a larger portion of their income on goods and services that are cheap, that are low profit margin areas.  Ultimately by making companies less efficient, the cost will be disproportionately borne out by those who are lower income.  That is a theory anyway.

Myself, I don't believe that VAT is a bad tax because it's regressive, so I don't subscribe to that school of thought, but it is often said that higher tax on companies is somehow victimless, to paraphrase the contemporary philosopher Nelson Muntz, it's *like taxing someone in the dark*.

I dislike corporation tax as a concept in the UK because of how it plays with dividend tax and capital gains.  Myself I wish we would tax income the same regardless of source, which would allow us to abolish corporation tax if we had ADR style rules for non domiciled equity holders.

In terms of *actual* policy and what leadership figures like Farage and Carswell talk about, I don't think 'anti-immigration' is accurate.

Which isn't a huge issue in the first place IMO because the vast majority of immigrants to the UK from the EU are skilled workers anyway.

A good point Farage has made before though is the unfairness of how we treat EU and non-EU applicants. If you're from the EU there's basically very few requirements at all. But to keep numbers down we have to discriminate against non-EU immigrants, even though that may mean rejecting some way more talented people.

Adding to the fact that their president, after losing against Barça, said something like ""It must be the last defeat for the whole season, it's not acceptable"" and bam, 2 days after that, they lost to Guingamp

To be completely honest, if the coach stays till february, I'll be feeling way more confident than if it has to be changed soon.

BUT, if they realised that their good players are warming the bench, and actually decide to play them PLUS the coach realize that you need more tactic than ""lets play 4-3-3 and give it to ibra"", then it will be tougher, but still, I dont think Paris can win this, they can be a threat, for sure, but they dont have the depth and mental to overcome even the slightest difficulty

Those are literally your two choices.  If you have an option to save money somewhere - why wouldn't you?  It means you can either do more; or make more.  It makes total logical sense to maximize your profit by minimizing your costs.

Flip the coin over and you see economies of scale and the ability to avoid (avoid is not illegal!) tax allows you to either do more, or make more.  So why would you not do it?

Yes we can blame companies and wish they were more moral, but until Texas executes a one I think we need to give up on this whole ""Companies are people"" bullshit.

We should be blaming our government, for creating an environment where:

1. It is possible
2. It is tolerated

&gt;The low charge is on the exceptional part sale of the Auto Trader group. No complicated planning was needed to produce a low tax-charge: the government allows for tax to be deferred in this case if funds are reinvested.

&gt; The government is NOT preventing anyone from having a 3rd child with this policy. Just saying they won't give child benefit for it.

Yes, in order ""to help behavioural change"". In other words they want to change people's behaviour. Now back to your earlier comment:

&gt; So if for example the government mandated that all people who were unemployed must have a vasectomy. That would be Negative Eugenics.

... because it changes how people behave.

which is exactly what they are proposing doing. It's eugenics **regardless** of whether they do it by forcing people to have a vasectomoy, or changing the rules for child benefits, or making certain behaviours illegal, because **all are aimed at achieving the same result**.

&gt; It's a population control policy, and there's certainly nothing wrong with a policy that aims to keep population in check though incentives

Whether it is right or wrong has nothing to do whether it is eugenics.

Your argument seems to be: this is being called eugenics; eugenics is bad; I don't think the Tories are bad; therefore it can't be eugenics. There is a massive logical flaw.

- Idle corporate money (to prevent people keeping their wealth inside companies, but not doing anything with it.

Still, there are better ways to reduce the risks of the financial system if we just had the political will.

I just think it's very damaging to use words like Eugenics incorrectly. If you think this is a bad policy, it weakens your argument to call it Eugenics, because it makes you look ignorant.

Eugenics is specifically an active intervention into reproduction. This is not that. This would be simply stopping financial support of extra children.

For it to be Eugenics they'd have to FORCE people to stop having a 3rd child.

Even the quite strict One-child policy of China is a grey area at best. There were reports of pressure by the government for poor farmers to have vasectomies. That is authoritarian and morally questionable, but still not strictly Eugenics, **because they weren't selecting for genetic traits.**

This thread has shown me that a lot of people don't understand the strict definition of Eugenics.

Eugenics is strictly concerned with ""improving"" genetic traits of humans through selecting for various traits and that's it. That is not what this policy is aimed at or even would accomplish. **There is no Conservative agenda to breed out the ""poor"" gene**.

My opinion is that internships are fantastic - but unpaid internships are not. When you are doing a useful job, you deserve to get paid, and frankly it's a great way to start off a new member of staff - it's not a great loss to a company to pay somebody the minimum wage for 6 months, and then either extend their contract and raise their pay if they are a good member of the team, or go your separate ways at the end of the contract.

* the ends will be nice and tight at this point, but the middle will be loose, giving you something that looks like a mirrored Mauna Loa. You can hook these under the station below them as you sew, or after you finish sewing, bundle them in groups of three and stitch them together.

* additionally, you can sand which the text block between two boards and a vice and add several thin layers of PVA adhesive, like Elmer's. The thin layers are key because they will be more flexible. Allow them to dry in between.

Pros:

* It's really friendly, especially if you're LGBT.
* There are some fantastic local businesses and producers - if you like artisan foods, independent producers and that kind of this, you'll be in your element.
* There are loads of great pubs around, including the Craft Beer and the Evening Star.
* There are also loads of super fun gay bars on the seafront for those so inclined.
* You're on the seafront
* You're super close to Lewes for quiet afternoons out, and London for day trips and weekends away. You're also really close to Newhaven for a ferry trip over to France.

Cons:

* Probably the most expensive UK city to live in outside of London
* The live music scene isn't amazing, compared to bigger cities like London or Leeds
* Lots of hills to walk up and down!
* The centre of town is pretty horrible on a Friday/Saturday night. West Street has a reputation for being the rougher area as that's where the cheap drinking holes like Yates and Wetherspoons are.

The reality is that in terms of corporation tax in the uk, it's about the percentage of the tax take it's always been (ignoring years when it was unusually high), and that it's also about the OECD average.  That suggests there isn't a specific problem with corporation tax, or at least no new problem that we haven't had for decades.

In any case why focus on corporation tax only?  We can collect taxes from companies through employers tax contributions, vat, and much else besides. 

If there are a few companies who are abusing the system, and it seems likely there are, osborne's idea seems a reasonable (but probably relatively ineffective start).

Also, you seem to think that tutoring or music lessons require talent or aptitude.  They don't.  That's why 99% of kids who take music lessons learn an instrument:  It's something 99% of people can learn given the time and effort and instruction.

But it's *already* causing problems.

&gt;What really is the big deal? Seriously now.

People need to see the face of whoever they're dealing with, unless there's a security or medical concern that prevents such. I think you need to acknowledge that there being an issue and there being an issue that you don't agree with the basis for complaint on are two different things - but the former is already here, unless you can point to a lack of press articles demonstrating such (or a huge upturn in non-cultural adaptation of the niqab to illustrate how folk have embraced it).

&gt;We've already ascertained that the whole 'symbol of oppression' schtick is not the main point

Indeed, but it's an inseparable factor if we assert that the former is acceptable. I thought the point was that even if it was asserted that wearing a mask all day was socially acceptable, the issue of *why* it's worn becomes important.

&gt;as you said yourself you wouldn't ban the turban or the hijab.

They don't cover the face. I could (and up to a point, do) have an issue with any religious garb and what it states/ represents, but if it's (for example) a cross-on-a-chain, that's much more easily ignored.

&gt;This means that the face-covering-in-public aspect is your main problem. 

Again, it's not just my problem. You can choose to not see it that way, but if that were the case, we wouldn't have [tabloid fronts like this from Friday](http://imgur.com/USvKjaJ). It's not really suggestible that this doesn't represent a deeper problem people have with it, but we also need to deal with the both-ways issue - if it's really such a non-issue, then why the problem with not wearing one?

&gt; I don't see people getting up in arms about balaclavas, morph suits, football mascots, or walking down the street in a motorcycle helmet.

None of those use the same justification, and none of them are worn all day, every day, regardless of who you come into contact with. If you don't think that's the case, try it - but I'd suggest that most people would be able to see the difficulties doing so would create without having to do so.

&gt;Why should they be forced to take it off permanently?

I'm not sure 'in public' and 'permanently' are the same thing - I don't really see how banning something in private would be workable, but stopping it in public would send the right message. I could wear a gimp outfit all day at home, (if for some reason I saw fit to do so), but how far would I get trying to wear that everywhere/ anywhere, every day, all day? I'd get arrested - and rightly so, because I don't get to dictate what society accepts on a whim. It's the reasoning the naked rambler keeps avoiding (because he also wants to assert that his opinions are what society has to revolve around) - and keeps getting send to jail for.

&gt;Who does it harm?

Themselves and others. This should be apparent whether you agree that they should have the choice or not.

&gt;Who's rights does it infringe?

Their own, and others. Again, this should be apparent regardless.

&gt;What is so devastating to one's ability to live peacefully about somebody wearing a veil in public

Do you have a precedent where it's acceptable in the UK? That it doesn't create divisions for no reason? Or do you have evidence that seeing someone's face adds nothing to day-to-day interactions? Or is polarisation where it's at?

&gt;that simply asking them to remove it if they can't understand them talk is not enough

Again, we already know it's not enough - if it was, news articles like the above wouldn't exist. It's not something one should actually have to ask for in the first place - that alone creates a 'permission' that doesn't actually exist (or carry water).

&gt;and instead requires a nationwide prohibition with fines and jail sentences to those who flout it?

It's almost like we had to enforce seat-belts because wearing them is such a no-brainer, why would we need the law? Do you need other examples of the obvious needing legislation anyway?

&gt;What does the 'many' actually need here?

To see a person's face when you talk to them.

&gt; They need the niqab to be banned?

They don't. The wearers apparently do, in public at least.

&gt;That's a societal need now?

&gt;No, being anti-immigration does not automatically mean you're xenophobic.

Eriksen- too good to drop. 

Lamela- too expensive, and still too soon to drop. 

It's a double edged sword. We need to let Lamela play with a wing back. Having Walker back will fix our ""narrow"" attack issues on the right, and allow him to invert. If he plays consistently with him and becomes comfortable knowing Kyle is behind him and what having his pace will do defensively, maybe he will play like his old self. Erik's style is all about taking risks, and I think it's in the back of his head all of our defensive issues behind him to actually take those risks for fear of being the scapegoat, and it's also forcing him into more defensive duties, which is not his strong suit and like yesterday when he is poor doing it, brings down his overall performance. It's been tough for him. People don't understand this isn't FIFA. You don't have control over every player. They have to face the psychological aspect of the game too, and these thoughts most certainly run through his head regularly while playing. Might explain some of his indecision.

My daughter ended up with peritonitis earlier this year thanks to the NHS's 111 service.

Called 111 because she had a really bad tummy ache. They said gaviscon and leave it. Nipped to the pharmacist who said that it should work in 5-10 mins max. Tried that, sod all.  Phoned back about an hour later, was told it was probably a bug and not to worry and to call back if it gets worse.

After 2 hours she was vomiting bile and doubled over unable to move.

Got fed up with the useless tossers, called 999 and they said they'd send an ambulance out. An hour later, nothing, so I called back and was told there were 175 ""minor"" cases in the queue and that they had ambulance availability problems and that we weren't a priority and that they would call a taxi and pay for it.

Did that, she vomited the entire taxi, the taxi driver got arsey about a £20 soiling charge. Told him to fuck off and talk to the NHS as he was being contracted out as an ambulance. He was rather surprised at this and agreed!

Then a 3 hour wait at the hospital after a 5 minute argument with the ""Urgent Care Center"" staff desk who put her in line for a GP. Eventually a surgical reg was called because she was screaming the place down. Was in surgery within the hour then, appendix out and on IV antibiotics for 4 days. Surgeon was totally fucked off and said the entire thing was avoidable.

Bear in mind she is 10 years old. Took nearly a month to get her back on her feet after this.

I believe there is.  I also believe in the next 25 years we're going to start seeing some serious shifting in socio-economic policy as automation and software makes huge cuts into the single remaining sector of large employment (Service industry 83% of the UK employment)

&gt; and that it's also about the OECD average.

I'd say that just means there is a global problem which hasn't been addressed.

&gt;In any case why focus on corporation tax only? We can collect taxes from companies through employers tax contributions, vat, and much else besides.

-- employers tax --

Only until automation cuts workers down to minimal numbers - then how do you tax the output, they aren't going to pay the single robot maintenance person (if they even exist) £2m/year

-- vat, and much else besides. --

If a company is taking raw-resources from your (the peoples) sovereign land - they owe you a due.  If they have access to your population as customers - they owe your country a due, etc, etc.  The logical end game of a capital economy one entity owns everything.  Let's just hope if we stick with capitalism that one entity is benevolent.

I think (capitalistically) we are between two systems.  Country and Global.  Some countries benefit (Tax havens)  from the current situation while others lose out (Everywhere else).

Well stop posting from that position, your posts make you appear to be totally selfish and self-obsessed (which is what inspired the ""HINT:"").

Absolutely untrue, to be ""explicitly pointing out they were shitheads"" they would have had to have used the word ""shithead"" (or some linguistic mechanism that left no other possibility), they didn't, so please stop posting *your* assumptions as fact.

Also that the post is not pro-UKIP apologetics, is not apparent from the first paragraph as you have asserted, as I said I took it to be apologetics, you didn't, so what now? Are you going to sue me?


If you don't like the sub, don't use it.

If you want a sub that doesn't already exist, create it.

So exactly what *is* your problem?

UKIP? The simple solution would appear to be for you ignore posts concerning said.

Me (and the way I use the English language)? Then ignore me (no loss on my side I assure you, you've made no real contribution to the debate as far as I can see, and you come across as thoroughly unpleasant as well as self-obsessed)

If you are tired, take a rest.

If you don't want to be taken a certain way, then don't act that way, selfishly demanding people (and reddit) should conform to your ideal and/or standards is how you're coming across, because *that's* the tone of the posts you are making.

How *dare* you presume to tell others about the language (and style of language) they must use?

I can assure you about the way I use English, it's not done to patronise, rather I give people credit for being able to understand considerably more than Estuary English. I certainly don't aim my posts at the lowest common denominator because that *would* be patronising, and the epitome of condescension IMO.

As for ""debate requires two sides"" there is clearly *more* than your position to this particular debate, and you demonstrably seem to be trying to stifle it entirely, whining as you are about too many posts on the subject, and the clear presumption on your part that reddit should be adapted to suit you.

If your premise had merit, these threads wouldn't have anyone posting in them...

They do. 

Ergo it seems arguable and entirely reasonable that you are wrong in your assertion (and that people want to debate UKIP, be it from whatever political perspective).

I guess we should take 1 average UK genome and everyone should just be a clone of that too, otherwise the genes from the parents they never meet will give some of the an advantage.

See, now I am strawmaning.  Isn't this fun?

No, it's boring!  I'm not convincing you or anyone else.  So we should both stop and take each other seriously.

false,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"For every story there is against the NHS and the 111 number, there is another anecdotal one stating the opposite. 

My experience with 111 could not be more different. 

I am very much allergic to milk, not lactose intolerant but truly allergic. I can't eat it at all without going into anaphylaxis and occasionally I can't even be in the same room with someone eating cheese on toast for example.

I had some dinner out, the place I had my food at messed up and didn't update their allergy menu despite adding milk to the food I got. I made sure 3 times, via the internet menu, paper menu and verbally with staff. 

Half an hour later I was walking home and I could feel my self having a reaction. I've become fairly accustomed to my reactions so I can generally predict what's coming next. However this time it was far more severe than usual. Normally I get blotchy skin, gastrointestinal symptoms and the worst itching you can imagine. This time my heart was racing, my face was swelling and I was finding it very hard to breathe. My asthma pump wasn't doing anything and my anti-histamine didn't make it any better.

Yes, that's definitely a serious medical emergency and I should have called 999 but this was the first time out of many reactions that I felt as if I couldn't predict what was coming next and at the time I was preoccupied with trying to not panic and die. 

So I called 111. I explained and the lovely woman on the other end asked me a few questions and said 'I recommend we send an ambulance to you', I was hesitant (who knows why.) and at that point she insisted. She stayed on the phone while I walked down stairs, until the paramedic car arrived, by time I was at the bottom he was outside my door. A proper ambulance arrived about 3 minutes later. 

They pumped me with drugs and set me on my merry way to A&amp;E. I was triaged with some sort of urgency, the paramedics stayed with me for far longer than I thought they would have and made me feel at ease. Great bunch of blokes, they were even poking fun at me for being in the more severe part of A&amp;E because I was a little itchy while seriously ill people were about (which is exactly the sort of thing I find funny, despite anaphylaxis being life threatening especially when it's restricting airways.)

Everyone from start to finish were absolutely superb. They identified the seriousness of my situation despite my underplaying it.


I'm very sorry to hear about daughter and obviously there is no argument - they fucked up there.
I've got my own fair share of bad stories about the NHS through my own experience of family experience.
The NHS has it's problems, many of them! I'm not arguing against that. 
But it's unfair to put down such a large and complex system like:
&gt;If you don't argue the shit out of the NHS, they will kill you.

Sigurdsson was the better passer, and arguably the better shooter (considering he was shooting with his left and looked more dangerous than eriksen ever does with his right)

Sigurdsson was also the better defender, and played on the dominating team.

The only thing eriksen seemed to do better than sigurdsson was his positioning for the goal, while sigurdsson has been playing everybody BUT right in front of goal for swansea, eriksen seems to be only stuck on either wing or right in front of goal. And while his chances at scoring are much higher than sigurdsson's, sigurdsson is still creating much more goals.

And a playmakers stats are not defined by goals scored, but rather goals/chances created.

I guess you could still favour eriksen in this situation, considering eriksen is younger. But there is no question who has been the better player this season, or even this game.

Reading is nice. It ticks a number of boxes for you with the things you said you're interested in. 

There's a few gamers nights. I think there's a biggish gamers group which meets every month in a pub, there's a monthly games night in katesgrove, there's the nags head which has quite a few gamers drinking in there. 

There's loads of great pubs. The nags head being the most popular ale pub. Plenty of choice though, look up the ale house, the hook and tackle (just reopened, lovely and cheap), the hop leaf, the allied arms, the eldon arms, the lyndurst etc. There's stacks. 

It's warm enough here being down south and there's a couple of historical points of interest. There's the museum, the abbey, apparently there's a museum in the hospital which is really interesting, if rarely open. The jail has interesting history. There's lots of nice buildings if you look above high street level. Nice walks along the Thames etc. Uni campus is nice from what I've heard. It's a good, friendly town. Got everything you need without being so big you need to drive everywhere. Good markets for fresh food.

Some Guardian readers don't like him. That much is true. But if you don't like his politics, you probably are on the right. 

Brand is anti-TTIP, anti-privatisation of the NHS, in favour of higher taxation for the most well off and doesn't trust the Tories. If you're a Tory yourself, you almost certainly aren't going to like him for this.

Migs is a great shot stopper but has anxiety issues and has even admitted being nervous(not exactly great for a keeper). As this lack of confidence comes across to us, you can bet it comes across to the players.

Skrtel, in response to this drops deeper than he should which then drags Lovern back further than he likes. It means that when Lovern and Skrtel are making challenges they are mostly lunging challenges as they aren't close to the opposing players. 

This also creates space between the defence and the midfield that our Defensive midfielder(a 34 year old with a history of so many injuries behind him) can't cover. It's no coincidence one of our better games this season was when Lovern and Sahko played together and pushed up. This gave Gerrard a lot less ground to cover and the fact we had Studge's pace pushing the opposition back we dominated a then unbeaten Spurs very easily(and kept a clean sheet).

We also lack a lot of bit in midfield. Coutinho, Lallana and Allen are poor where tackling is concerned and as a whole the front players don't press as much as they did last year. 

Blaming one player, although a major part of the problem is lazy and doesn't tackle the issues as a whole. Yesterday Migs was replaced by Jones, but the defence still dropped deep on top of Brad, there was still acres of space between the defence and midfield, the slight players still were bypassed way too easily and although we pressed better than we have in a while it was still way off last season.

Corporations don't pay tax.  If they pay tax, then it's only because they made profit; which they made by charging customers.  And eventually (like for VAT) their customers are just citizens.

If, eventually, citizens pay tax.  We just need a method to ensure that the richest citizen's pay the most tax.

The solution then is to move to a tax that cannot be avoided.  So, we should set corporation tax to zero, and use unavoidable land value tax.  Finish off with a citizen's income to sort out the vast majority of benefits and the state gets a source of income and it automatically routes from richest to poorest.

Playing eternal whack-a-mole over tax avoidance schemes (which are legal, so corporations have a duty to avoid tax), is not the way to fix the state.

&gt;Power tends to corrupt and **absolute power corrupts absolutely.**

Becomes the game.  People start to squabble.  For instance, in my slightly over one year old company, I'm working a lot this xmas, it's easy for me, because having recently broken up, I've frankly got nothing better to do, and there is a hell of a lot of work.  However, one of the gang, and we are still only single digit in employees, took off 30 days just a few weeks ago, and is going to be taking 7+ days off again now.  This is already creating some friction, some people are asking why this person has more equity than they do, are we going to be paying them at all for this time off etc.  Now this isn't a problem for the 'core team', those who have been here longest, because of our skill sets having such little overlap.  But for those not there in the beginning they feel the need to prove themselves, sometimes sadly, incorrectly even, they do this by pointing to other people who are working *less hard*.

People are human, and humans are dicks.  I've pissed off more than once a couple of our guys, mostly because I get tired with how slow they can be to grasp an idea that I've firmly in my head.  It tires both sides, and it's vital to have an understanding of this.

It works for us, because we aren't the students union (this is a phrase we often use) and certainly not a democracy.  I like to quote a scene from Firefly, the chain of command is the chain I get to beat you until you understand who's in command.

The share of equity is also very un-equal, with my co-founder having the largest single holding, and majority voting rights, because he put up the vast majority of the seed funding, basically mortgaged his house.  My risk was a lot less, so my equity is.  We are also a lot more experienced in life I think than many of the valley scene are.  This means that we know that if the company works, one person walks away as a double digit millionaire, single for a few, and others just a few hundred K and a nice lifestyle job.  There is no doubt or un-certainty on this.

Compare that to the kid who never even finished college, never had been betrayed or fucked over on any business transaction.  Now they build something which is useful, and suddenly they get this rush of power and money.  You look at people like Zuckerberg and how he fucked over the one guy who had his back, people like Bre Pettis behave like they are 20 year olds too, and this is lapped up in the US start up culture.

Everyone I know, every last person from the US high tech start up scene has come away saying it sucks, or is a millionaire bitter that they aren't a billionaire.  Now there is certainly a selection bias, I simply won't be meeting with the most fortunate ones.  But the reality is many people are dicks, the younger you are, often the worse, why school bullying is worse than university and so forth.

But there is also the learning phase, many large firms are encumbered by difficult procedures and the like, but often, for reason.  Startups don't have these, and they gradually have to bring them in, this pisses people off.  Things get lost, people get hurt feelings, lines emerge between people.  As you get larger you have to just assign responsibility, you can't manage an entity of your new found size without it.  People see only their little bit, and lack appreciation for what someone else does, animosity starts to run high, this compounded by the fact many of these people have never had a relationship, let alone a business one before.  Like kids on the playground they simply don't know how to behave.

It also has to be recognised that many, many people in technology are a little bit towards the difficult side of the behaviour spectrum, add in lack of experience and you've got a very unpleasant atmosphere.

false,Delheru,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; VAT is a regressive tax system though (it hits the lower incomes more than the higher)

I'm not sure that's really the case actually, though if done in a simplistic way it absolutely would be the case. A lot of the essentials are VAT exempt, meaning the food, books etc do not have VAT on them, while laboratory robotics etc certainly do. 

Would require quite a sophisticated study to estimate which income percentage crowd actually gets hit hardest by VAT.

&gt; The fact that companies are announcing record profits while our government is cutting massive amounts of social welfare shows there is absolutely a need.

Nonsense. Depends on what the companies are doing with the money. There is no point for companies making record profits unless they send the money back to someone. There are a few options to this:      

a) They re-invest it back in to the community. Well then, think of this as government stimulus without having to tax OR waste money on government bureaucracy. Beautiful, and significantly better than taxing it.        
b) They re-invest it, but abroad. This is a little trickier, and - unlike ""a"" splits depending on where the company HQ is.       
b1) Local HQ. This works out fine as the returns on investment will ultimately come back to the UK economy.        
b2) Foreign HQ. This is maybe the least pleasant scenario, but on the other hand there is not that much to be done here. Or rather, any heavy handed measures here will simply chase the service away - see Google News and Spain.               
c) They make their shareholders wealthy. Well, this is where you get to tax those shareholders just fine.    

Basically there are a few choices here: 
Either you tax the money at the company level, the individual level OR a mix of both (which is what we try).      

The reason why the individual level is best is because none cares if their corporate entity exists in the bloody Antarctica. Or if they are represented by 5,000 legal entities spread all over the world. Neither of these options is really possible as an individual. Or if you're die hard enough about avoiding taxes that you go build your fortress of solitude in the Antarctica, more power to you, you nut bastard.

Eriksen is younger, and faster in acceleration. But other than that you cannot compare these players because Sigurdsson is taller, stronger, faster(full sprint), better at defending, better at passing, and better at shooting.

I still believe only Moreno, Lallana, and Lovern were bought as ""now"" players, while Balotelli was bought as back up for Studge or the occasional partner when we put 2 up front. Everyone else was bought with the future in mind.

Now half way in, we are seeing some good stuff from Markovic, Can, and Manquillo which leads me to believe these players can be good for us. Lambert has shown that although not a regular, he'll also be able to do a job as the third choice striker. 

Lovern has been inconsistent. Started well enough and now alternates with average and utter shite but Lallana has shown flashes although his lack of fitness and stamina worries me. I would like to see Rodgers stay on, as if we now have the numbers, the next logical sense will be to look to add 1 or 2 players per window.

That way you look at quality, and as you have the numbers you can just let it go if you don't get the players you want. Also, the younger players are showing promise and there's a lot of pace coming through. Realistically, next season we could have Sterling, Markovic, Ibe, Sinclair, Sturridge, Origi, and Balotelli to choose from up front. Adding into that the skillful palyers like Suso, Lallana, and Coutinho. We will have a lot of options soon.

* [VAT is considered regressive, because poor people pay more of their income as a percentage than rich people on it.](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2011/01/04/why-vat-is-regressive/)

* Taxing resulting in reduction of efficiency is much harder to demonstrate because of the whole macro/micro thing, but something like *The Undercover Economist* or *Freakonomics* will give a bit of background on what I was getting at there.

* Nelson Muntz from the Simpsons is a complex portrait of our inner demons, our id if you will.  He spreads the idea that the bully is his own victim, his actions, a product of his flawed perception of life, lack of empathy, understanding of consequences.  I use him to characterise the person who wants to make the world a better place, but not by doing anything themselves.  The idea that taxing corporations is somehow victimless is, that is to say has no effect, to me, I think it's an amazing example of cognitive dissidence.  If you are 'taking money out' of a system, it has to have come from some place, it will have consequences.

* The rules for taxing income for [dividends are different to that of regular income](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends/overview) The idea is, that as some corperation tax has been paid, the dividends should be taxed less.  I don't get the idea that income which is earned through a job, should be taxed differently to income that is earned from your savings, I don't see why we need to 'encourage' people to not have paid income.

I mentioned ADRs as an example of how the US deals with non-US entities in regards to trading equities.  It probably isn't worth looking at unless you have to, as it's very boring.  The point I was making is that we can have a tax for holding any kind of UK equity, whilst not being domiciled in the UK.  If you buy an equity, you have to have a UTR (Unique Tax Reference, which if I'd been in charge would have been called a UTI because I'm immature like that) if you don't have a UTR, you have to buy it via a system which requires the entity to make payment to HMRC.

However, if your software company turns out to need employees to come into the office, and that you feel you'll get a better selection by setting up in a metropolitan area (and that seems to be the case with, say, London), then you will pay significant amounts for your metropolitan office.

You've still missed the point though -- I said set corporation tax to zero.  The idea isn't to tax corporations, it's to tax landowners.  If you are rich from your software company, and you want to live in a big expensive house (and rich people _do_ want to live in big expensive houses) in big expensive areas, then you will have to pay more tax.

According to the Generalised Land Use Database, about seven times as much land is used for private homes and gardens as it used for commercial premises. So we would expect the tax collected from residential land to be about seven times as much as tax collected from commercially used land.

Commercially used land can be roughly categorised into i. high value city centre land, used for retail or entertainment outlets and offices, and ii. lower value out-of-town industrial estates and factories. The rental value of the high value categories is hundreds of times as high as for the latter, so the rental value of a hundred acre site for a factory at the edge or town is still probably lower than for an office block in the centre of town. So, the little low-land-use digital company pays hundreds of times more unless they are willing to set up shop in deprived areas.

Anyway, the point I was going to make is that so many people waste the time of the experts with useless shit (e.g. going to the doctor with a mild cold, or A&amp;E with a baby with the slightest cough) that they've had to put up these layers to protect and prioritise their time.

Yeah I know what a regressive tax is. I didn't know if there had been studies on what the actual end result was. The multitude of VAT exemptions make the end result trickier than a flat VAT would.

For example a VAT with everything exempt except luxury cars and private jets would hardly be regressive in practice, even though it is indeed a VAT still.

&gt; Except in your own reply you outline b2 - corporate foreign shore tax avoidance. and c - which allows for personal tax avoidance.

B2 doesn't really do much if there is no corporate taxes if the offshoring is artificial. IE the actual HQ is in London, the owners are largely in the UK etc, but there's a rather artificial HQ in Luxembourg. This means nothing if corporate tax is 0%, because the real taxes will be paid by the owners anyway.

C is way harder than avoiding corporate taxes, and the most likely ways to do it come with considerable personal burdens (180d+ pear year spent in Monaco and shit like that). The clear majority is unlikely to do this, and the loopholes to close are WAY easier than the ones on the corporate side.

Eriksen is more agile, has better reaction timing/acceleration, but as a football player he is neither as effective nor even comparable to sigurdsson.

Sigurdsson is just bale without pace, except better on his weaker and not as good at heading/defending. He has miles better vision/passing than bale but the crossing is fairly similar (however bale is more effective due to his pace when it comes to crossing)

I've got no axe to grind with you, but it seems you want to point the finger and then not be held responsible for your own actions, it was you that said (paraphrased) people need to stop posting about UKIP.

What's that if *not* censorship? 

Where have I vilified you? I simply responded to what you had posted. I certainly didn't malign you, or post defamatory statements.

&gt;Look, I'm all for a political debate, but this entire discussion isn't a debate, its just a shouting match. 

In what way do you feel *I* am responsible for that?

You entered the debate (as far as I was concerned) saying (paraphrased) that reddit was doing it wrong, too many posts are made about UKIP, and then telling me I was patronising (if that's not the seed of name-calling based unpleasantness, what *is* it?).

You complained about others posting too frequently on this subject, and that it has offended your sensibilities.

&gt;I'm going to leave this conversation here, my day has been shit enough as it is without having my credentials as a good human being questioned on an internet forum...

Awww poor you. It's fortunate you could displace responsibility for that onto myself (at least that's how it seems from my perspective) isn't it?

I'm not saying it's her own fault or anything like that, but a lot of people here are very quick to condemn the 111 operators when even the woman's family haven't yet heard the calls. For all we know she could have phoned up 23 times and said she had ""a bit of a tummy ache"". 

As you say, it's an inevitable consequence of a system that relies on people accurately describing their own symptoms over the phone. I know I'm terrible at that. If I tell my wife something is hurting she always asks me what ""kind of pain"" it is. I have no idea how to answer that question. 

The idea that one call handler would choose to neglect an old woman 23 times, or that 23 different call handers would choose to do so (or anything in between) seems far too awful to be likely.  

The only thing that we can say for certain is that it was a great shame that someone died unnecessarily. I hope her family finds the peace they need.

The answer, as in all similar questions, is maybe.

Despite my qualifications and experience, when I purchased my first house using a mortgage broker. He used a broker-only lender and I ended up with a reasonable deal. The lender paid him a procurement fee (read: commission) of £500 for the work - he didn't charge me anything.

The best direct-only alternative for my circumstances (first time buyer, 90% loan-to-value) was a marginally better fix for a marginally shorter time (iirc. 3.8% for 4 years vs 4.0% for 5 years). I made the decision that a longer fix was preferable.

In addition, direct mortgage applications tend to take a while, and we were on a tight timescale due to having bought a new-build and given our notice on our rental property. The mortgage decision/offer was given within 3 days of the application and the valuation conducted within a week of that. Compared to my experience working for the bank this was incredibly fast.

I think brokers make up an important part of the overall ecosystem, and given that most operate on a commission-only basis it is surely worth asking somebody local/reputable the question, and looking at what they can offer vs. direct alternatives.

Someone said that they were both on the left and impressed by a journalist, and you demonstrated that the journalist had right-wing beliefs.

I used a 'random lefty tumblr' as an example of the lowest possible common denominator of left-wing thought; Brand is slightly less awful than bad tumblrs, thankfully. So what I was saying was that there was no contradiction between being on the left and thinking the person espousing left-wing arguments made a less convincing case than someone espousing right-wing arguments.

Just as an aside, I read Keynes a couple of years ago and don't really see him as being 'left' in the way we would conventionally describe it - I'd argue that Mill or maybe Rawls are lefty *qua* lefty if we're going for the really big political thinkers that have influenced the modern left.

false,prepositionmoe,null,null,"Might look good on paper, but you're retarded if you're actually comparing him to those players.

Eriksen just got a fluke goal and assist yesterday in a game where he had a non existent performance.

Eriksen also scored a fluke header and assist against united at the start of 2014.

I'm going to remove those 4 created goals because they will probably never be recreated in the premier league.

So from that alone he is 10 goals and 6 assists, 16 in total. Which means he is probably on par with several other players tied 5th.

And exactly how many of those goals are from freekicks? 2-5 roughly. But I'll just say it's 3 even though it's probably either 4-5

And how many of those 6 assists are from sigurdsson literally pulling a goal out of his ass while at the club? 2-3.

So in open play, eriksen has around 5-6 goals and 3-4 assists. Which barely puts him over 10 goals created in 2014.

Granted, in reality he DOES have 20, but considering how the goals were created/scored and other things, and also factoring in mata being a bench whore, toure cooling dramatically off in form since the start of the season, and hazard being limited to chelsea's playstyle (which does limit assists/goals compared to playing for a team like united/city/liverpool) I'd say that stat isn't even remotely as impressive as it sounds.

And referring to the coaches, it is irrelevant that eriksen was chosen as cam over sigurdsson, as it is mainly down to avb's mistake at playing him as a winger while bale was occupying cam/cf. Tim played sigurdsson in cdm and occasionally lw, but there is no question that eriksen had very little (if anything) to do with where sigurdsson played on the pitch.

EDIT:

And no, Eriksen does not have a registered through ball this season. He might have had one last season but this season he does not.

And eriksen's assists (that i recall) have either been from a corner, butchered free kick, and of course sigurdsson. There might be one or two that I am forgetting but aside from what I mentioned he only has 2-3 assists.

We played to accommodate a world class player who has left us. Rodgers got that spot on, now we have to give him a chance to get the tactics right again. I believe he will. Yesterday we played better than we have in a while but lack of cutting edge and a few defensive errors cost us. 

If we get a confident, commanding keeper in, we'd see a higher line defence, more confidence, less goals conceded and we'd pick up more points.

So?  You still seem to think the goal is to get as much as possible from corporations directly.  It isn't.  They aren't paying that anyway, they must earn it in order to pay it.  Tax isn't a punishment -- if Google are making £6bn (incidentally sales is not profit) a year -- good luck to them.  We're talking about the best way to fix the tax system.

&gt; The modern economy in Britian is based on selling 'nothing'.  A land tax is a daft idea based on the 1800s view of economic activity.

Is land being used?  Yes.  Does every square metre of land have an owner?  Yes.

Well then it can all be taxed can't it?  I don't see what the 1800s has to do with that.  Why would you want to tax ""economic activity""?  If you tax something you get less of it.  Taxing land is one of the least economically distorting taxes because it can't be moved and is always necessary.


You need only look at the mess that is the property market to see that we are in a _worse_ position now than in the 1800s as far as allocation of resources to property goes.  That means we have more need for LVT, not less.

The alternative is what?  Another 100 pages of tax code specially to ""get"" those corporations?  That's worked so well all the previous times it's been tried, why do you think it will work this time?

I'd like to think we'll put out a more effective unit against them this time around. One of my hopes for that grim January Saturday was that Matty Phillips would have a storming performance out of no-where, but that wasn't to be. We might be more effective up the right wing this time around with Isla and Vargas, but even if only as relief for Zamora I expect Vargas to be up top at some point.

If Vargas does indeed start on the wing and Bobby is alone up front, then I don't see how you can't play Fer through the middle. I don't think  Kranjcar has the pace to zip in while Bobby holds the ball up.

Alternatively, I can full imagine Harry sticking with a 4-4-2, with Zamora and Vargas up front, and sticking with something like Fer and Barton at the edges of the midfield line, with limited instructions to attack so that they are nicely positioned to support the neutralisation of Baines and Coleman.

If we are going to get into a firefight, I think we need stellar performances from Isla and Yun.

They have a whole bag of tools to throw at the likes of Henry, Dunne and Caulker though. Lukaku, Eto'o, Mirallas, Barkley, McGeady. It's quite depressing.

This is true, that explanation for the word is something people came up with without knowing the actual etymology of the word.

The real origin for the word comes from a variant of the swedish word for law ""lag"" with a suffix added for the specific form. I'm not a grammarian so I will not go into details there. The old meaning of the word lagom would be something akin to ""according to law"" but not specific to judicial law more of something that was considered ""right"" or ""righteous"". Which would bring us back to the definition with ""just the right amount"" The word lag (law) has strong connections with making things right or whole as seen in ""laga"" (to mend, or to prepare a meal, to make right what is wrong) and the word ""olag"" which denotes something wrong or out of it's rightful place.

The time taken up by customers would be your biggest problem though, keeping the money coming in will be difficult if people buy one coffee then play a game for 30 minutes.  That doesn't sound profitable to me.

He's a former commodities broker who *defected from the Conservative Party*. 

He's made his living conventionally, his entire image is one of a conventionally British man and he's actively campaigning to govern the country and may feasibly end up in a coalition with the Conservatives. 

Brand on the other hand, actively encourages people not to vote for the major parties - Labour, the Tories, the Lib Dems and Ukip - because they represent the interests of the rich and the powerful. He wants nothing to do with government and is afraid of becoming one of them. He wants something radically different. 

Brand is way, way, way to the left of any major political party except maybe the Greens. UKIP though, are basically an extreme brand of the Tories. This is why the Tories are imitating UKIP instead of taking their lead from Russell Brand. 

And this is what makes the establishment view basically synonymous with conservatism. If you want to defend the status quo (the way things are currently run, i.e. the establishment), as conservative and right wing parties do, you don't allow the progressive change that Russell Brand and his ilk call for. 

You don't go to something radically new, you go back to something that existed before (a time before a welfare state, say, or the 1930s in the case of the Tories; or a time before the EU in the case of UKIP).

But most parents don't volunteer or get to know other parents. And our school doesn't release addresses or phone numbers in a book like they did when I was a kid. So it is possible that the parents ask the kids if they're friends or play together. Of the kid says no, the parents might assume it's an obligation invite?

Also, present prices are a huge part of the problem. The average gift from friends at my daughter's party? 30 to 40 dollars. So if your child is being invited to a lot of parties, you need to pick and choose. Or you bring a cheaper present and don't get invited anymore because parents are mean.

false,[deleted],null,null,"The reason an unpaid internship is unpaid (aside from because they can get away with it) is because it does not matter who does it.  If it required a certain skill set or talents, there would be people better or worse at it and employers would pay and pay more for the people better at it because it would be worth paying more for someone good.  But when the whole role consists of getting other people coffee while you hope to be given the opportunity to say something that might influence the spring collection, you are not working.  You're just there taking up space.

That's why I question whether these are ""real jobs"".  It's not because I don't think they involve hard work or long hours.  It's because there are vastly more, qualified, willing, people than their are positions.

Given that, is it ever reasonable to think that experience in that position will lead to a paying position?  Or that it will lead to a well paying one?

Maybe, for 1% of people who are very lucky and born with certain abilities.  But not for 99% of the people working them.

That is my objection, that's why I say these are not ""real jobs"".  If people want to contribute, we need more engineers, more scientists, more decent managers, more builders.  We don't need more (failed) fashion icons, more footballers or more pop stars.  People pursuing such paves should be aware of the risks and they should incur the cost themselves, saying it's not fair that no one will pay me a living wage to play football or work in fashion is the same as saying no one will pay me to reddit all day, even though that's what I want to do!

Sorry if this seems harsh.  I am actually pretty left wing (I think?) but I am a hardened realist.

Maybe it's my life experience:  I got a physics degree and then had to choose between being penniless and a researcher for 10+ years (1 step above an unpaid internship) or going to work in IT.

false,Hemmers,null,null,"We have short memories. We act as though everyone has a right to buy a home and the market should be managed to make that possible for everyone. Yet barely a generation ago many people didn't own their home, they spent their entire life living in a council house paying a small amount of (below-market-value) rent.

The change has been that rather than paying a subsidised rate to the council or housing association, you pay market rate to a private landlord.

With the right-to-buy schemes of the 1980-90s, much of the council housing stock has been sold off, leaving it in private hands (whether that's privately owned by the occupier, or being sold on a couple of times and falling into the hands of a private landlord). Ironically, this project to help people own their home *reduced* housing stock for lower income families as the councils had sold much of their housing stock, which was either occupied or being rented out by private landlords at market rates.

The problem is, lots of people don't *want* to buy a house. Students want a 1 year lease - they leave home to go to uni, work may well take them somewhere else once they've graduated. However cheap you make it, they probably can't afford to buy and then sell a house. Similarly a contractor maybe wants to rent a flat for 6 months because they're working away from home and don't want to relocate their family for the sake of a few months, but needs a permanent base to stay at during the week.

There is a legitimate market for renters outside of people who can't afford to buy.

Therefore you *have* to have rental housing stock, If you ban buy-to-let mortgages, then that doesn't eliminate the rental market - it simply restricts that industry to people with massive personal wealth who can afford to buy to-let properties with cash rather than the current situation where you have lots of 1-2 property private landlords - i.e. someone who's done reasonably well for themselves and has paid off their own mortgage who invests in a second property as a nest egg.

The market already attempts to compensate for this as buy-to-let mortgages have crippling interest rates (effectively business loans) compared to retail mortgages for a personal home.

Similarly, you don't pay capital gains when you sell your primary residence, but you do on other properties you own (holiday homes, rental properties, etc).

These act to reduce the attractiveness of residential property as investments.


The simple answer however, is to build more houses.

The population is growing, thus housing stock needs to keep up with demand. People are living longer, rather than dying and freeing up their home, and over the past decade we've seen much increased immigration than over previous decades (that's not a political comment, just a statement that we've had more in than out).

The UK's birth rate is the same as it was in 1980 (though it took a dip around 2000 before rebounding) yet people are living to be 80-90 instead of 70-80, meaning houses which would have become available are staying owned for an extra decade. Moreover, those are often family homes which retirees have kept, with many unused bedrooms only slept in when the grandkids come to stay, which would be better employed as a full-time family home.

So aside from physically building new homes, ""right-sizing"" occupiers is also important - getting people to move out of family sized homes into smaller houses (which often are more manageable and easier to clean/maintain for those of advancing years). It makes no sense to have retired couples living in 4 bedroom houses whilst families of 5 squeeze into a 3-bedroom semi. Of course it's not quite that simple because it's a wrench to leave the family home where you raised your kids, etc. However, due to longer life expectancy, those ""wasted"" bedrooms are now remaining off the market for as much as a decade longer than they previously would have. There are various ""house swap"" schemes where you don't need to part with your home but move into someone's smaller house whilst they move into your larger house, to mutual benefit.",0,1418661278,null,0,1418661815,0,cmvlmhw,t3_2pd7yg,t1_cmvlmhw,t3_2pd7yg,null,1425388959,28,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,28

false,prepositionmoe,null,null,"Not really random shit if eriksen will never produce such chances again. His header against united was nothing short of a fluke, even he himself admitted it on ekstrabladet. I don't remember his assist but I doubt it was anything special either.

And then of course his fluke goal and assist yesterday, he got his first ever corner assist in the premier league yesterday and I doubt he will get one again in a very long time. His goal was due to the swansea defender taking the ball away rather than letting it roll to the keeper, forcing it to a newly substituted fullback with little experience in the league, crossing it straight into his former team mates feet and giving eriksen possibly the easiest goal of his life.

Two games should NOT make such a significant difference. Especially when they are gifted in such a manner or cannot be reproduced. I see absolutely no difference between his header/corner or last minute winner or jagielka's last minute volley. Flukes.

I'm not referring to eriksen's goals this season as freekicks, however a lot of his goals last season were indeed freekicks.

And how many of eriksen's goals this season have been last minute winners? I wont take any one of them away from him aside the swansea one, but if whatever opposition just defender properly for the remaining 5 minutes eriksen would probably be on par with sigurdsson goal scoring wise this season.

And where exactly is the logic of comparing sigurdsson as a LW to eriksen as a cam? Eriksen is better as a winger because he has reaction timing/acceleration, which is key on the wing. But defensively he is worthless. Sigurdsson's body type is built for a playmaker/cdm unlike eriksen's, so naturally you should compare stats between the players being played in their preferred positions? Right?

Sigurdsson at the same age as eriksen: 18 games, 7 goals 5 assists in 18 games, 1494 minutes. Goal created each 99minutes

Eriksen's currently: 16 games 6 goals 1 assist. 1275minutes goal created each 182minutes (237 if you take away yesterdays game)

--------

Eriksen last season: 25 games, 7 goals 9 assists. 1975minutes goal created each 123 minutes(134 if united game doesn't count, 179 if you take away sigurdsson's goals that eriksen ''assisted'')

Sigurdsson's current season: 16 games, 2 goals, 8 assists. 1356minutes goal created each 135 minutes

The difference is, eriksen has overperformed compared to his abilities. Sigurdsson has underperformed. Yet sigurdsson's stats are vastly higher.

And that is only considering goals/assists, that is not considering his defensive duties/heading ability and general contribution which eriksen physically is not capable of.

Eriksen is a fantastic player, but he has only gotten worse over the years. Having followed him since his u17 days all the way to his u21 tournament in denmark (which sigurdsson played against him in and beat denmark in a 3-1 humiliation as a key role) Eriksen has only lost his pace more and more each year, while not gaining muscle mass or becoming a better defender/header etc. And this is only going to get worse, considering how his superior reaction timing/acceleration is the biggest reason behind his goals/assists (if you look away from free kicks and sigurdsson's/kane's individualism)

Eriksen WAS a very promising talent, now he is slightly past his prime and he isn't showing any signs of improvement in other aspects of football. While sigurdsson is much taller and can sacrifice some of his pace to bulk muscle mass and move further forward, or even back.

Factoring in someones ''age'' doesn't work like that if said individual BENEFITS from being young. Eriksen was much faster and skillful in his youth days, now he is slower and much lazier.

So not only is he worse than sigurdsson in attacking abilities (stats and technique don't lie) but he also lacks in other important aspects of football, defending/heading/work rate/physical abilities etc.

Please prove me wrong, I'm literally begging you. Because I know you cant and you know you cant.

EDIT:

I'd also like to go further into detail with sigurdsson, that despite his stats being vastly superior to eriksen's, he still hasn't been able to fully get into gear offensively. He could have many more assists than he already has and his goals have not come as easily as they have in previous years which is still being figured out. He doesn't get into the same shooting positions like he used to do, and priorities passing/crossing rather than shooting. But he still has two goals (3 if you count his goal against everton in the cup) and hasn't been far from scoring more either (krul/green/begovic all saved 100% goal scoring opportunities against him, in similar fashion to de gea against liverpool yesterday) while eriksen has been much more lucky with his chances

Sigurdsson 1. Eriksen 0.

EDIT 2:

I also forgot to mention a couple other things.

Eriksen has been the playmaker for the 4th-5th best team in england in recent years. Sigurdsson was swansea's playmaker when they were newly promoted and had a striker in danny graham (15 goals in 54 games)

So sigurdsson played for a worse attacking unit and had better stats than eriksen, and now he plays for a much better attacking unit and still has better stats than eriksen. Except now his stats could/should be better than they are, while eriksen is very lucky to have his current stats.",0,1418661312,null,0,1418662188,0,cmvln6r,t3_2pa8z0,t1_cmvln6r,t1_cmvk9qg,null,1425388950,-3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-3

Then why are officers running from call to call, missing breaks and not even getting the chance to use a toilet for hours at a time?

I'll tell you why - the police are currently the only agency who operate 24/7/365 and who will actually turn up. We can take 10 calls requiring an 'I' or 'S' response , and not a single one would be a criminal matter - missing persons, mental health crisis, overdoses, RTCs, drunks lying in the bushes, neighbour disputes, arguments, actual anti-social behaviour, percieved anti-social behaviour, suspicious persons, alarm calls, calls for people trapped behind closed doors, sudden deaths, stray dogs, concerns for safety, arguments about taxi fares, arguments about the cost of a restaurant bill, tenant/landlord disputes, breach of the peace, the list is endless. Then add on your 'non-crime domestics', where two adults in a relationship have had an argument (whether they've called us because they're both alcohol dependent and can't manage to share the remote without a third party telling them how) or two normal people who've had a barney that the neighbours have overheard (or parents can't manage their teenage children).

So on top of that you've got burglary, shoplifting, theft from motor vehicles, theft of motor vehicles plus a smattering of alcohol related assaults and it's a wonder there's any time left to stop and search anyone.

All this requires some sort of report. Whether that's a crime report, a vulnerable adult or child come to notice report, an intelligence or an ASB report, that's easily half-an-hour's work on top of the call attendance.

You can point to the headline statistics all you like, but the simple fact is that call figures are going up as other agencies struggle to cope (London ambulance service have basically sunk, there appears to be literally no out-of-hours or crisis mental health teams and social services may as well not exist outside the hours of 10am-4pm) and someone has to answer those calls. If you cut the police funding much further, those calls will stop being answered. The emergency response teams are tiny - out in the counties, you might have 10 officers for an entire force area doing everything overnight, and it's not a huge amount better in the met. We'd single patrol, but we literally don't have enough cars and we've nowhere near enough officers to do an old-fashioned home beat system.

tl;dr if the police only dealt with crime, and nothing but crime, you could cheerfully cut away. But they don't, and there's nobody else to pick the non-crime stuff up.

&gt;__Turkish delight__ or __lokum__ ([Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language): *Türk lokumu*) is a family of [confections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery) based on a [gel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel) of [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch) and [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar). Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are mostly gel, generally flavored with [rosewater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewater), [mastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastic_(plant_resin\)), [Bergamot orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange), or [lemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon). The confection is often packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with [icing sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_sugar), [copra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copra), or powdered [cream of tartar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_of_tartar), to prevent clinging. Other common flavors include [cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon) and [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha). In the production process, [soapwort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapwort) may be used as an [emulsifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsifier) [additive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive).

Seems to me that you knew enough about these laws to confidently proclaim what their punishment might be, but why are you fighting so hard not to show me what grounds you even have to thinking your own opinion?

&gt;Do you actually think that if I had fare-dodged like this and then not paid any of it back because I couldn't afford to that they would have just set up a repayment plan and allowed me to maintain my anonymity in the same way they did for this guy?

Yes - that is exactly what they would have done. And if you had reneged on that payment plan, you would have been punished for that - because you would then have committed TWO crimes. Moreover, the only reason we're even hearing about this guy is not because he was done for fare dodging, but because the Financial Whatever Authority got involved and made it public.

false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Corporation tax raises £40bn a year. If we agree that the states needs that money then under your 0% idea, it needs to be passed over to other people.

Yep.

&gt; What you are saying is that any company that makes it's living off selling ""nothing"" (IP, advertising, licencing, finance etc) would be exempt from tax.

Well yes; because every corporation would be ""exempt"" from tax to the extend they choose not to use land.  You are still ignoring what I've said repeatedly though: companies _already_ do not pay tax.  By definition they can only pay tax that they have earned.  If tax is lowered on them, that simply becomes another place for competition to drive costs down, and they will simply sell their products for less than they do now by exactly the difference in taxation.  Who then pays this tax?

These IP, advertsing, licensing and finance companies you speak of: do they have offices?  Where are those offices?  Do they have employees?  Where do those employees live?  Do they have customers?  Where do those customers live?

These companies that sell nothing, like ""finance"", where are they located?  Have a look at their balance sheets and see whether they have (a) zero assets in the form of land or (b) massive quantities of land assets.  Have a think about where the richest people in the UK live, and where they work and for what companies -- I guarantee you it is not Sunderland.

&gt; The people and companies that live on UK soil, and use inputs would now take on the burden.

What makes you think those people aren't already taking on the burden?  Where do you think tax comes from?    The richest people in the UK live in the areas with the highest rent -- it's they who would take on the burden under LVT -- what would be bad about that?

My ""plan"" (it's not my plan, considerably cleverer people than I have been advocating land taxes for years) is to shift taxation from taxation on productive activities like running a business, employing people, earning money, purchasing from companies, and shift it to unproductive activities like sitting on land and waiting to get rich off windfall earnings from the efforts of others.

The idea is to pick the LVT percentage such that total revenue would be unchanged (or whatever the government of the day decides it wants to take from us) -- the total burden would therefore be completely unchanged; but who pays it would change.  LVT makes richer people pay more tax; it makes it impossible for them to avoid paying it, and it is less distorting to economic activity (i.e. we don't dedicate time to arranging our affairs to avoid tax, we dedicate it to making the country wealthier).

As all three established parties (not *just* the Tories) seem determined to preserve the status quo (and thereby keep their noses in the trough), I stand against them all, until such time that is, that one or another (or indeed all) come out as determinedly against the current way that banks and corporations bribe MPs with seats on the board after they retire from politics, back-handers, etc in return for concessions/favourable legislation/preferential treatment now, and others who use their power to hide other (shall we say ;) ) ""nefarious"" activities.

There has been at least one time where we had even the best friends RSVP no because it was holiday time, so I re-scheduled the party after talking to some parents so we would be assured to have friends come.  I am not the only one who has re-scheduled a party for this reason. We are all pretty up front about it.

My oldest son has Asperger's, is homeschooled and is seriously light in the friend department.  I usually talk to the parent's to plan to be sure that someone comes.  We also give the option of taking a weekend trip instead of a party. He has chosen that the last 2 times.

My youngest son is super popular and very outgoing.  However, his birthday is 4 days after Christmas. NO ONE is in town.  We have always invited every single human we could find to have a handful of kids at his party.  Last year, I just told him that we would wait to have his party in mid-January when people are back in town.  Worked better.  So we are doing that again this year.

My brothers and I have birthdays in July.   We usually just had a combined family party with my brothers because everyone is gone in the summer. I was popular (at least in grade/middle school), so it had nothing to do with popularity. 

So sometimes it is about timing.  And sometimes you have to work a little harder and get parents involved to have enough attendees if your child needs some help in that area.

Drogba has scored most of his goals as a sub or against opposition that was not up to our level, precisely because he doesn't have the legs to play a full 90 at the highest level any more. The only goal not falling into either of those two categories is the one against united. He's been great, but he's a super sub. 

You don't have super subs as defenders. Terry is pretty much useless as a player if he can't play the full 90, which, as we are seeing with Drogba, isn't something we should expect him to do at the age of 36. Defenders get better by playing and training week in and week out with the same people to get a better understanding of each other.

Mourinho already said this season that Drogba is training much less than all the other players to not wear him out. This isn't something that you can do as a central defender, he needs to work with his team mates every week.

You say this isn't fifa and then you go on to compare a striker to a defender, when the physical expectations of their roles are completely different.

I tried the copper coil, and it wasn't for me so I switched to the Mirena. I'll bring it up next time I see my GP about my acne prescription, though.

The science in this review seems a little simplified and gushy. Some photos of her boyfriend's skin and an ingredient list would have  added more credibility I feel. Typically, I was thinking of trying Cleanance K just as it's replaced! I'll wait for more reviews on this version.

Anyways this one thing about her infuriated me so I always intentionally made friends with the ""losers"" in an attempt to prove something to her. She turned out to be right, but I guess I did too in a way. 

Like I said, known 3 people this bad. One of them stayed exactly the same. He didn't change at all, ever. Not even really today. Just exactly the same. We aren't really friends anymore but that is just because I did change and in adulthood you're not forced in to the same environments anymore.

A second one got crazier and crazier and crazier. Then one day he sent me a suicide note and vanished. I was crushed and very, very angry. Then he popped up a couple years later! I was happy and very, very angry. But it turns out he got admitted to a hospital for some time so I got less angry. Plus they actually really helped the guy. Today he's ""normal"" and successful and happy and outgoing and all those things I am very happy for him. 

A third also got crazier and crazier, but he has never gotten better. I get really upset about him a lot of the time I don't know how long he's going to really make it. :(

And my mom was right because you can't expect people to change, and sometimes they will try to drag you down with them, and people do judge you for who you hang out with. She was wrong because when people *do* change it is the most incredible thing to get to witness, and sometimes people will let you drag them up with you or even bring you up with them, and plenty of people actually judge you positively for liking everyone.

You need to offer affordable state housing that doesn't line the pockets of private landlords and pay of their mortgages so that the young generation can afford to save (with predictable rental costs) for their own property.

The solution is for the council to own more social property which they can use as council housing to enable generation rent to get savings down for a deposit.

Perhaps we ought to have a look""

But that's an example of the many and myriad demands on police resources - the government don't want a repeat of the 2011 riots, and the police certainly don't, so that's another thing response units need to be looking out for while they're doing everything else.

At the moment, police commanders are reluctant to say no to calls because they don't want to have to explain why someone's died after a call handler decided that police shouldn't attend. It might be, however, that it'll get to the point where they'll have to accept that risk, and face the wrath of the public, press, government and the IPCC in the event that they get it wrong.

If you keep paring policing to the bone, something's going to give and it will probably involve someone dying. As the bloke who had been lying in the middle of a 4-lane fast road because he couldn't cope any more said to me last night as we took him to hospital, ""You're all a bunch of cunts and I hate the fucking lot of you, but we'd be fucked without you"".

People keep ringing, so we must be doing something right.

With the new state pension, that period is 10 years.

The counter argument would be how much they also cost the state in addition to their pension. The new state pension is about £7.7k a year. A considerable stay in hospital would probably cover that. Add too the cost of using roads and every other cost the average person expends to the state.

There was a chap on the radio the other week who came over years ago and worked 3 jobs. Now he has no job and lives in the woods. Why? Because other immigrants were willing to work for less money.

&gt; New porn laws banning spanking and caning go too far and Government should not be ""sticking their nose into people's bedrooms"", Nick Clegg has said.
&gt; 
&gt; The Deputy Prime Minister backed Liberal Democrat MPs who are opposing a ban on a list of erotic acts being shown in porn because they have been judged “harmful”.
&gt; 
&gt; He said that some if the acts may seem ""exotic"" and others ""deeply unappetising"" but it is not for politicians to decide how people ""get their kicks"".
&gt; 
&gt; Last week protesters gathered opposite Parliament simulating sex-acts - such as ""face-sitting"" which will be banned under the new laws.
&gt; 
&gt; They were protesting against new rules introduced by the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 which mean that paid-for porn watched online will have to comply with the current British Board of Film Censors guidelines. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Mr Clegg appears to back the protesters as he said the new regulations had not got the balance right, and that the state should not invade the privacy of people’s bedrooms.
&gt; 
&gt; He told his monthly press conferences that he shared some of the concerns raised by his MPs: “It is not a prurient judgement of whether we approve or not of someone’s behaviour of the privacy of their bedroom. It is not the role of politicians to cast moral judgements on that.""
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s whether we think that in a free society, people should be free to do things that many people might find exotic at mildest or deeply unappetising at worst, but it’s their freedom to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; ""That seems to me to be is a classic liberal assertion.” 
&gt; 
&gt;  He added: ""Government is not there to stick its nose in the bedroom as long as people are not doing things which are illegal under the law.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It’s not really for us to judge how people get their kicks, but it is our role to make sure the law is upheld, and that the law does not encroach on private spaces where the law has no role to intrude.” ",0,1418666896,null,0,false,0,cmvonhv,t3_2pdnrc,t1_cmvonhv,t3_2pdnrc,null,1425387511,69,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,69

Terry has been lucky not to be injured, but right now I haven't seen any evidence to say that he needs to be benched next season. Even with Lampard last year there were a lot of signs that he couldn't be a starter for us anymore. He was constantly caught out of position and forced to make bad tackles that led to early yellows. There hasn't been any of that with Terry this season. 

I expect next year we might start to see the signs and maybe we start having this conversation seriously that he might have to sit some games out, but right now there are no signs of that.

FWIW It's not the public that own the Bank of England, it is privately owned and run for profit which means there is always more owed by the exchequer to the Bank of England (or any privately owned central bank) than exists.

Putting the owners of the central banks on trial for fraud and extortion of the public, and seizure of all their assets if found guilty however, *would* IMO be a step in the right direction.

At the moment we live in a society run by politicians that work for the banks and corporations not the British public, and therein lies the problem, we vote for them and they betray our trust (whilst keeping very quiet about who they are actually representing).


The proof of that would be that the £80 billion that Cocaine-George Osborne garnered in ""Austerity Tax"" was given away by the bankers in the £81 billion they paid out in bonuses (not wages, bonuses).

Porto- Won a Quadruple and went an entire league season unbeaten, with an 85% win ratio which is insane

Chelsea- Pretty bad, but following Ancelotti was always going to be hard and player politics were ridiculous that season

Tottenham- First season with Bale a win % of 50%, without Bale in the season he got sacked he had a win% of 65%, with 14 clean sheets in 26 games. One of the most unjust sackings I've seen.

Zenit- Got a win ratio of almost 70% so far, looking good.

false,JoeSalmonGreen,null,null,"I think you are referring to ICES. Quite a few of us were worried about this, I'm very against NHS privatisation or marketisation. Brighton Council is not the Green Party, it isn't even Green controlled, they are a minority administration and the 3 main parties do everything they can to play politics with the lives of the residents there to run the city into the ground and show the Greens to be incompetent. Given the Circumstances I think the local Green Councilors do quite well.

Anyhow I'll give you the response in full I received from one of the Councilors down their on the decision.

*""ICES is a service which stores, delivers and cleans equipment to help sick and disabled people live at home. The service is managed by Sussex Community NHS Trust (SCT) who provide most of the resources, staff and vehicles. The City Council have a small number of staff in the service and it is primarily based in a council building. The service is jointly commissioned by the Brighton &amp; Hove NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and the City Council, the funding split is 55% CCG and 45% council.*

*There have been discussions for some years about the future of ICES as its current building and resources are inadequate. Some years ago SCT explored moving the service to Brighton district hospital but this was not progressed due to lack of funds. The service is seeing 13% year on year growth in demand and will be subject to requirements for 7 day a week working as part of the government’s Care Act and Better Care Fund agenda. SCT recently gave formal notice that they will no longer be providing the service as they do not feel it is core to their strengths and they do not have the resources to invest in the service. It had long been informally known by staff, unions and partners that this notice would be given.*

*As a result the Health &amp; Wellbeing Board (a joint NHS/Council body) reviewed a range of options for ensuring that the city continues to have an equipment service once SCT stop running ICES. Given the tight timescales and limited finances the preferred option was to work with a neighbouring council, West Sussex, to jointly find a new provider for equipment services. This followed the council’s Adult Care &amp; Health Committee having given in principle approval to such an approach nearly a year before-hand. This decision had to be endorsed by the council’s Policy &amp; Resources Committee where an amendment was moved to try and stop a decision being taken. This raised complex legal questions given the junior role the council has in jointly commissioning the service so the decision was deferred pending additional legal consideration. A special meeting was held once these issues were clarified and the decision was made to proceed in partnership with West Sussex.*

*As the provider NHS trust didn’t want to run the service any more and the main funder, the local CCG, had made clear they would partner with West Sussex regardless, the council had a choice - split the service and have only 4 staff left to try and operate an independent local service (essentially not a viable option in any sense) or continue working in partnership with the CCG and join the West Sussex arrangement. West Sussex are using a private contractor for this who are committed to paying at least the Living Wage, are accredited to use the Local Government Pension Scheme and respect TUPE. This was felt to be the least worst option in the circumstances and no councillor voted against it.""*

I think the reality of the situation is the NHS is being privitised, and one minority administration in Brighton won't change that.

What is direct democracy in your mind and where is UKIP's firm manifesto commitment to it? They don't have a good record in terms of writing manifestos or keeping to policy commitments, especially when it comes to the voting record of their MEPs (for an anti TTIP party they have had one MEP vote on the matter and he voted in favor) http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/ukip-ttip-eu-trade-deal-2014.html.

When he came over he was a totally different kid, really cool. When we went back to school on Monday my friends asked about it and I told them that we were friends now. After that everyone started including him and he stopped all the nonsense.

Since then I tried to not let my judgement of people dictate who I associated with. Especially in middle and high school, I made friends with pretty much everyone. The ""popular"" kids didn't really treat me differently because I was friendly with the ""losers.""

Ask yourself why you were yourself in positions where you might get robbed. Ask yourself why you are putting yourself so far out there that you gave half a fuck about the actions of some intimidating chav. Did you have a good life to go back to? Did you have a wife and kid at home to take care of? 

The fact that you half-hoped you get the chance to brandish it or use it says it all, and that's coming from someone seemingly in control of himself. For every one of you out there, there are maybe 2 or 3 that let their fantasies overcome them, and then one temper flare and they're a murderer. They get so used to carrying their knife, maybe for years, it becomes second nature to them and the illegality of the action disappears. But the sense of power and confidence doesn't.

They begin to not bother signalling when changing lanes, because they know they'll come off best in a collision and they know all other cars will probably yield.

&gt;This is the crux of Liverpool’s problem. To attack in the ways they’ve been successful over the past year — fast, sudden raids on opposing defenses — Liverpool’s attackers have to remain higher up the field when the team doesn’t have the ball. To do that, the attackers need to trust the midfielders behind them to do their jobs. And then those midfielders have to trust their defenders. It’s a high-wire act made all the more dangerous by the fact that the players occupying these roles aren’t there for their defensive abilities. Gerrard plays as a deep midfielder in order to spring attacks with passes up to those lightning-quick attackers, Dejan Lovren is the side for his passing ability as well, and Moreno’s value comes from his blinding speed in getting forward.

...

&gt; Last year, Brendan Rodgers went with the latter, and Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge covered up plenty of defensive mistakes. Those two — with Sterling as a turbo third wheel — would just go out and score more goals than the other team. This year, that’s not an option, and Rodgers has been unable to adjust. He’s careened wildly from too open to too conservative and back again. We’re almost halfway through the season and Liverpool are barely clinging to the top half of the table. The question is no longer whether Rodgers can keep all of those balls up in the air; it’s too late for that. What matters now is whether he can pick them up again — and whether Liverpool’s ownership will even give him the time to do so.",0,1418673290,null,0,false,0,cmvs97q,t3_2pdai2,t1_cmvs97q,t3_2pdai2,null,1425385830,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Crap over the phone was insuring it which was quite difficult. Then on the first MOT we had to get the airbag working again which took two air bags bought off ebay plus about 5 hours using friends and friends of friends expensive diagnostic kit to turn off the light.

We think we'd have paid £300-500 to get it sorted in a garage.

As a first car I think you'd be mad to buy a CAT C/D. You're probably going to buy something that has faults and if you buy a CAT C/D I'd be confident that something seriously wrong will be missed.

Also if you do buy a CAT C/D you've got to reconcile yourself to the fact that it's going to be very hard to sell. There's no chance I'd buy a CAT C/D privately as it's bound to be 90% newspaper and araldite.

Pointing toward players like Pirlo, Totti, and Giggs is like me pointing toward Ronaldo and saying we should Hazard to be a 40 goal a season player. You're picking a tiny hand full of players who are pushing the boundaries of what we though was possible and saying we should expect Terry to do that to. While I would love for Terry to play well for that long, it just seems stupid to expect that he will be one of less 10 outfield players to play at the top level into his late 30s.

&gt; Some guys are like Xavi and crap out at 33

Not some. Most players drop off at about that age.

&gt; Even Gerrard was showing signs that he needed to be benched for a few years now

You mean the Gerrard who led the league in assists last year and made the PFA team of the year (http://www.thepfa.com/thepfa/pfaawards/bpl-team-of-the-year-2014)? I'm not saying he's been at his tip-top best for the last year or two, but he's had a significant drop in form this season. When players get to an older age, that happens quickly and without warning. 

I'm not saying we need to take him out right now, but we need to be prepared for a quick drop off to happen and having Zouma as our only real cover doesn't feel prepared.",0,1418673601,null,0,false,0,cmvsfwv,t3_2pafzw,t1_cmvsfwv,t1_cmvoyqr,null,1425385743,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1
