true,Dafman,eng-essex,Essex,"I smoked roll ups (10-15 a day) for about 10 years and I can only handle 6mg liquid. I tried 12mg but it was just too strong. So I would recommend 12mg at the most. 

My portable setup is a [Vision Spinner 2](http://myepack.co.uk/batteries/vision-spinner-2.html) and a [Kanger Aerotank](http://myepack.co.uk/clearomizers/kanger-aerotank.html). I would go with a tank made of glass as some liquids will crack the plastic ones. The replacement coils for the tank run at about £8 for 5 and they usually last about a week, 2 weeks max for each one. If aesthetics aren't an issue and you want something with an enourmous battery, there's the [MVP2](http://myepack.co.uk/itaste-mvp-v2-0-black.html) (which comes with a tank as well.)

As /u/paramount86 has said, Snake Oil is a very good liquid to try. I think a lot of good liquids come from the US, with places like [Cloud House Vapor](http://cloudhousevapor.com/) and [Spiritus Vapes](http://spiritusvapes.com/) selling those for the UK. Basically anything from those sites taste amazing. I was put off vaping for a while when I first started because the liquids you can buy in shops like newsagents were pretty nasty, but if you buy some decent stuff you will really notice the difference. It's also worth mentioning the PG/VG (the two main ingredients of eliquid) ratios on the bottles. PG gives you more flavour and a stonger (sometimes pretty harsh) throat hit, while VG gives you more vapour and tastes fairly sweet. I usually use 50PG/50VG to get the best of both, but most 'premium' liquids will be more VG based.

The initial cost of it all is a bit expensive but once you've bought a tank and battery you only really have to buy more coils and more liquid, which ends up being pretty cheap. You can pick up a 30ml bottle of liquid for about £10 and that will last a few weeks in my experience.

It is doing something useful, and by the way the welfare payments are basically just pension payments, housing benefit/job seekers/disabaility allowance is about 20% with the other 80% being pensions.

The way it works is the young pay for the old now, unfortunitley there was a baby boom and were trying to make up the shortfall through immigration so we can keep paying for pensions. a deficit doesn't really matter all that much when you can inflate away your debt (happens naturally). Every government raises money on capital markets and markets buy government bonds because their a safe investment in our case because we have the bank of england as a lender of last resort.

You say Welfare isn't useful, I say making people homeless on mass if they lose their job and the current people relying on it (pensioners, low wage workers, people with children) would be the most stupid thing anyone could ever do... hence why we don't do it... infact it's why no government does it.

Capitalism didn't put a man on the moon, an space race against the USSR did that. Mercantilism kicked off the industrial revolution not Capitalism. The wheel wasn't invented by capitalism, neither was gunpowder and medicine has been around for thousands of years largely out of a desire to help people for those 1000s of years (you may have trouble getting your head around that).

Working people have more to lose if they get caught rioting, so are far less likely to do it.

If you could lose your job, pay a huge fine, and possibly go to jail because you nicked a TV, then you're going to think twice about it if you have half a brain.

If you live week to week on benefits, have no savings and no job, there's far less punishment for you if you get caught. Any fine would be taken out of your benefits at a couple of quid a week, and a hell of a lot of the looters during the riots were repeat offenders. Most of the rioting was simply an excuse by certain people to go out and steal shit.

It's all about the risk/reward. The less you have in life, the more you're willing to risk it all.

This is why the UK prison service tries to focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment. If you can help an ex-con get out of that cycle of offending and get something in their life that they're not willing to lose, they're far less likely to re-offend.

The US system is all about punishment with the 3 strikes system and brutal prison conditions, and harsh punishments once outside that make it hard for them to be a contributing member of society. This system has shown a high amount of recidivism because the ex-cons are stuck in a repeating cycle of not having anything in their life to care about, so they are far more likely to risk re-offending.",0,1409928231,null,0,false,0,ck9wxi6,t3_2fj254,t1_ck9wxi6,t1_ck9sbj6,null,1427184287,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

**Name of product:** BIODERMA PHOTODERM MAX ULTRA-FLUID

**Price of product:** £15 (current full price on escentual.com)

**Where did you purchase:** Escentual.com I would keep an eye out as Escentual often do 3rd off deals on french pharmacy, which is when I got mine.

**Product claims:** ""Balance and protect your complexion with the Bioderma Photoderm MAX Ultra Fluid SPF50+, maximum photoprotection for combination and oily skin.

Guaranteeing maximum protection from sunburn, skin intolerance and premature ageing with its anti-UVB and extreme anti-UVA performance, the Photoderm MAX Ultra Fluid SPF50+ also directly protects the skin cells with the patented Cellular BIOprotection® complex.

The lightweight fluid is perfectly suited to the needs of combination to oily skin, feeling ultra-light and refreshing when applied. The colourless fluid melts into the skin and leaves no greasy residue or white marks.""

**About you:** I have oily, but pretty good skin. I'm not particularly sensitive and the reason I wanted to try this sunscreen was for the high PPD level of 40.

**Your opinion:** I really wanted to love this product as it has such a high PPD level. Unfortunately it makes my skin incredibly greasy, and doesn't sink in very well. I didn't find it left a white cast, but then my whole face is one big white cast so I'm probably not the best person to judge! I also found that because it was so greasy that make up didn't sit well on top. In summary, despite being marketed for combination to oily skin, I don't think this works for oily skin at all. Possibly for dry skin, but I couldn't be a judge of that. I would buy this sunscreen for holidays when I know I will b in the sun a lot (I'm a sucker for that PPD) but for everyday use, I will not repurchase. I will continue to use it until the bottle's empty though.

I think he probably will sign a contract because Juve will dangle a big fat signing on fee in front of him, probably in the next 6 months. And he knows that if he really wanted to he could force through a move in a couple of years anyway.  

&gt; There will be a war of teams offering him the best contract but not a bidding war. How often do bidding wars take place now?

Why would a team risk waiting until he has 6 months left on his contract when they could offer Juve money for him. That benefits Juve the most, and he's under contract there.

true,IanCal,null,null,"&gt; As far as terms go, well the difference between an ISA and a NISA was one, but you sorted that out in your post

Ok cool, so for a bit more clarification on that, there used to be a complex limit of how much you could put into cash or stocks and shares ISAs, but since July that complexity has basically disappeared now that they're NISAs. NISAs have a limit of £15k/year, if you see that figure then it's a NISA.

You should be able to put £15,000 a year into them, but there's a caveat.

You have £15000 of allowance each financial year (april -&gt; april). This allowance goes down when you put money in, but doesn't go back up when you take some out. So if you were to put your salary in each month and take it out again, you'd quickly run out of allowance. It's pretty much an encouragement to put money away and leave it.

&gt; As far as additional income is concerned I do have small sums coming in from my job (hourly minimum wage bar work) but also a pension credit (not currently paying, will be £85pm once I'm at uni again) which HMRC have told me in the past, takes a bit out of my tax free income allowance.

Nice. So you've got £10k a year of personal allowance, if you earn more than that you get taxed on the extra (so if you earn £11k in a year, you only get taxed on the £1k, not the whole lot). You're not going to be anywhere near that figure so you've got nothing to worry about there.

The reason I ask is that NISAs pay their interest tax free, which can be great if you're paying tax but if you're not then you can get higher rates without the worries about limits elsewhere.

&gt; but AER/APR??? Are they the same as '% interest'?

Yep, pretty much (I think I got AER and APR switched around in my post). There are some fairly minor technical differences, but they're what you mean when you say ""% interest"". There's more info on the differences here: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/interest-rates

When looking at savings, the key parts to look for are:

1) Can I get hold of my money (watch out for 1/3/5 year fixed deals, they can be great but they're not what you're looking for, also some have 90 day waits for money)

2) Are there any penalties for taking money out? (Some take interest away from you if you withdraw within a year, or more than a certain number of times per year)

3) What's the interest rate?

4) Is it safe?

That sounds like a lot, but the banks aren't trying to trick you. Accounts will have ""EASY ACCESS"" plastered all over them, any conditions are always made really clear and you can always just rock up to a bank and say ""HALP, please explain these things"".

4) is fairly important (in my opinion) but easy to check. Most places have FSCS cover which means that if the entire bank falls over, you can get your money back from the bank (up to £85k per person, per bank). Almost everyone you deal with will have this, but it's worth pointing out before you see a tempting rate from a small overseas bank. All of the accounts listed here have a note saying if they've covered, and again you can always ask the bank: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-accounts-best-interest

&gt; There's something about being a student which means I don't pay certain taxes I think but I'm hesitant to say anything confidently.

So you still pay most tax, but one that you get away with is council tax. That's paid based on the property you live in. If everyone in the house is a student, there's no council tax. If there's one non-student adult then there's a 25% discount, and any more than that and the full amount is due. This is nice to get out of as it's not based on your income but the property itself and can easily run over £100 per house/flat (not per person).

Sometimes though I felt your assessments were slightly overvalued. I mean yes, we do have amazing food and weather, but I cannot agree with that ""People are well informed about politics"" statement. Guess it's pretty much like in every other country - there are some dumbasses not giving a shit about anything, and there are more intelligent, well oriented people as well. But again, it depends on the place you live - and since you're living in Warsaw, apparently you dealt with the latter ones. 

There's a point, however, that I must strongly agree with. People in Poland are freakin' gloomy! I live in Glasgow for more than 4 years now and can't stress enough how I love the way people/strangers talk with each other here. I mean, it shouldn't be nothing extraordinary to say sorry after stepping on someone's foot, but people in Poland do not give a shit about such details. Well, I always try to show my positive attitude (such as a mild smile when both of us are looking at each other at the same time), but in Poland all I get in return is a ""Do you have a problem?"" question. And it's not because they care ;)

Isn't that the SNP? They promote a lot of centre-left policies now but the impression I get is they only do so as a means of achieving their aim of independence (they certainly have threatened to go against these policies where it supports their position as well). Traditionally they were called ""the tartan tories"" and were rather conservative themselves, and it's telling that in a number of their safer seats (like Banff and Buchan, Alex Salmond's former parliamentary seat), the conservatives achieved some of their best results at the last election, polling close seconds to the SNP.

I think you're right though. Before the Unionist Party (a scottish conservative party) merged with the England and Wales Conservative party, the UP was the dominant party in Scotland and even returned an absolute majority of votes in one 1950s election. People in Scotland dislike the Conservative party itself, not conservative ideology.

The driver sees the bike coming towards him, and he thinks ""okay, I've got time to pull out"". That thought then turns into him putting the car into gear, turning the wheel, and moving the car. Say that takes 1 second (would probably take 2 or more). At 97mph, the biker is doing 50 meters per second, so that straight away adds 50m to your calculations. If you do take it to be more than 2 seconds, then that's hundreds of meters of difference. You could even add half a second for him looking down the road and then turning to look into the side road as he starts to move - that's another 25m. Swap all that around to add on the biker's reaction times when he sees the danger ahead.

I posted this screenshot from Streetview in another thread, but [this](http://i.imgur.com/DdaKpj5.jpg) is where the bike was one second before the car started to turn, when the driver possibly committed to the decision in his head.

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"&gt; Why the fuck would Juve let that happen? If Real made a bid of £50m they wouldn't just accept it, they'd say to the other interested parties ""well Real bid €50m and we haven't accepted that so you'll have to bid at least €55m"". That's how negotiation works.

Because Juve won't have much choice and everybody knows that. Juve aren't in a good financial position and they 100% can't let Pogba leave for free, these top clubs aren't stupid and won't offer £50m for a player who's only got a year left. If Madrid offered £30m everyone else would just offer £30m and then Juve **NEED** to accept it if Pogba wants to leave or they get nothing for him the following year. You're acting like clubs are stupid.

&gt; Just because he signs a new contract doesn't mean he won't be able to move. He will sign a new contract, with a huge wad of cash attached to it. Then, two years later, he could just say ""right, I'm bored of Italy, I want to go to Spain"" and Juve wouldn't have a great deal of choice but to accept an offer. I know this will happen because footballers are greed and agents are even greedier.

That's risky though, with Pogba being as good as he is Juve aren't going to offer him a big wad of cash unless it's a 5 year deal in which case Juve could refuse to sell him in two years time when/if he wants to leave.

I train there early every morning because I work in the city centre, so here's a rundown:

* The equipment is excellent, there is a massive range of cardio machines, and the rowing machines are Concept 2s. There are plenty of mats for stretching, or doing some weird freakydeaky yoga poses like some of the old men do.

* The weights machines are great, there are 2 of the most popular ones too so you very rarely have to wait to use one. There are three cable machines too, which is rare in a commercial gym, let alone a 24hr one.

* The free weights area isn't too bad, there are 2-30kg DBs (not really heavy enough at the high end, but that doesn't affect most people there). There is only one squat rack though, and one smith machine, so if you go any time that isn't super early/late, you'll have to wait to use them. Extra olympic bar, small bar and EZ bar too.

* The staff are mostly pretty useless - some of the personal trainers there don't seem to have too much of a clue (unsurprisingly), but there are usually a few that seem pretty switched on

* It's clean, the showers are pretty decent and there are always tons of lockers, and for £10.99 it's a steal

* You get to see the most hilarious people in there from time to time, there are some real characters, who seem oblivious to the rest of the world going on around them

Downsides:

* Do not go between 5-7pm on weekdays, it's fucking mental in there. It's a combination of those girls who think that slowly cycling on a bike whilst reading Closer will get them to look like Cheryl Cole, and some total meathead estate agent gymbros who are unaware of exercises that aren't curls. You won't get anywhere near any weights, and will have to wait for cardio machines.

I say go for it OP, I'm glad I did. Just find the best time to go (I suggest 6/7am or 8/9pm) when it's relatively quiet, and you can crack on with things. Plus...it's only £10.99

They can be fined for this and presumably just don't care.  An employee is not required to operate PAYE and I can't think of any circumstance where he can be slapped for the company's failure on that part.

The accountant is correct in that he shouldn't register as self-employed.  In particular, if he does he is then doing something wrong.

One option would be to register with HMRC for self assessment.  This would achieve two things.  It would give him a tax reference.  *(This is separate from your NI number.  It'll be a ten digit identifier.)*

The first page of a return are for employment income.  He can enter his earnings and normally you would enter the tax deducted under PAYE.  If he puts in just the earnings this will generate a tax bill.

The employer's Class 1 NICs will be unpaid, but that's not his problem.  HMRC can pursue the company, if they so choose.

Additionally *(this is entirely optional)* if he wants he can pay the amount he thinks he should have paid as tax and NICs onto HMRC.  If he's disciplined he should keep it until the due and payable date and get some interest *(Yeah, I know.  Not much!)* on it.  If he's concerned he might squander it and find himself with a nasty bill he might be better paying earlier than he has to.

It's not a perfect solution, but it's workable and won't require a huge amount of effort from him.

No, because the Championship, League One and League Two are hugely more popular than their Spanish and German equivalents. You can see just by the crests on /r/soccer the large following the Football League has in this country. 

Adding a league of B teams, [as stupidly proposed by Greg Dyke earlier this year](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/06/greg-dyke-b-team-league), would be very damaging for these leagues - no longer could they loan a top youth prospect to help them gain promotion, as they'd just be sent to the B-side; the gulf, in both quality and finance, between the Championship and Premiership would grow even wider; and fans of these clubs wouldn't want to be playing against a B-side with no fans at an empty Premier League stadium.

The people going across are salafis. ISIS is a salafi organisation (same as KSA, Taliban and Al Qaida). This sort of violence, mentality etc... is part of that brand of Islam. They might come back but are they going to become non-salafis or rather go on to preach their brand of Islam to other vulnerable ""moderate"" muslims?

The answers are quite clear but people, especially the false liberal lefties and the people in control of the state don't want to confront the real issues because for the false lefties they use the issues to ""fight"" the right while the for the government it would affect their foreign(non-state) assets.

How does your friend work, does he work as a *true* employee: a fixed working day with fixed responsibilities and no control over his work, or does he work in a way that could deem him to be a contractor? If he's a contractor then self employment is the solution, and if he works as a true employee and the employer does not have a UK presence then it's possible that ""[PAYE Direct Payments procedures](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/pommanual/PAYE20100.htm)"" will apply and he can manage that himself without his employer taking part.

Working for foreign companies with no presence isn't something everyone does, but it's far from rare situation that no accountant has encountered before. I work for an American company that had no UK presence for a couple of years and had absolutely no problems, I just filled in a self assessment every year and paid the tax that I owed, HMRC didn't seem to have any problem with that. HMRC just want their monies.

The major problem your friend is going to run into (if any) is that he hasn't contacted HMRC, that's going to make him look like he's been trying to avoid tax. How long has this been going on for? If it's less than a tax year it won't matter much, if it's been multiple tax years he may run into problems with an upset HMRC.

I would recommend

* Ring around a few different accountants, it sounds like the one you spoke to isn't too great
* Speak to HMRC

&gt; When the shit hits the fan who is going to be held liable for all the tax avoidance?

Each individual is responsible for their own tax, HMRC will almost always hold individuals responsible for any unpaid tax.

True, I do appreciate your concern but to me that's the best result here. There shouldn't be too many of them and this is the only way we can maintain our sense of superiority re: morality and justice over dictatorships. We shouldn't undermine what our country represents for the sake of the hope that its a safer option to.  

That's my take anyway, I appreciate it wont be popular but I think this an important test of what Britain ""should"" be about.

&gt; **Russian claims that NATO promised not to enlarge**


&gt; Russian officials claim that US and German officials promised in 1990
&gt; that NATO would not expand into Eastern and Central Europe, build
&gt; military infrastructure near Russia’s borders or permanently deploy
&gt; troops there.

&gt; No such pledge was made, and no evidence to back up Russia’s claims
&gt; has ever been produced. Should such a promise have been made by
&gt; NATO as such, it would have to have been as a formal, written decision
&gt; by all NATO Allies. Furthermore, the consideration of enlarging NATO 
&gt; came years after German reunification. This issue was not yet on the 
&gt; agenda when Russia claims these promises were made.

&gt; Allegations about NATO pledging not to build infrastructure close to 
&gt; Russia are equally inaccurate. In the Founding Act, NATO reiterated “in
&gt; the current and foreseeable security environment, the Alliance will carry
&gt;  out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary
&gt; interoperability, integration, and capability for reinforcement rather than
&gt; by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces. 
&gt; Accordingly, it will have to rely on adequate infrastructure 
&gt; commensurate with the above tasks. In this context, reinforcement may
&gt; take place, when necessary, in the event of defence against a threat of
&gt; aggression and missions in support of peace consistent with the United
&gt; Nations Charter and the OSCE governing principles, as well as for 
&gt; exercises consistent with &gt;the adapted CFE Treaty, the provisions of the
&gt; Vienna Document 1994 and &gt;mutually agreed transparency measures.”

http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_109141.htm

I wish the leaders of NATO would do more to show this is false, because it is becoming a common theme.

&gt;What was Nato's business in bombing Serbia?

Stopping a clear and unequivocal genocide. Do you think it was wrong to stop a genocide?

&gt;If Nato is the international genocide police, then why hasn't it become involved in the many others that have happened in its existence?

They're not the genocide police, in the same way that I'm not the normal police.

How about not letting them radicalise the vulnerable muslims in the first place. What happens when they do get new recruits? monitor them also?

The only way I can make sense of this is if we are defining ""that big"" differently and How does domestic violence link in with this???? we're talking about jihad/terrorism here. 

You should seriously go find out what ""Salafism"" is before you start commenting on issues to do with Islam/muslims in this country! Most if not all university ISOCs are salafi controlled or strongly affiliated to salafism. Also understand salafism is a small fringe group of maybe 1-2% of all muslims but the narrative they sell is quite appealing to the otherwise non-religious UK citizens of muslim immigrant backgrounds.

I live in an area of Glasgow called Pollok, where a brand spanking new shopping centre and cinema complex are being built. Not to mention the fact that we're one of the most populated suburban areas in the city. I moved here in 2010, and as soon as I moved in I began asking about fibre from BT and Virgin. I was told that it would come on the 1st of January 2011. Later a map with details of this was published by BT, confirming my hopes and their claims. 

1st of January comes along and no fibre, they then updated the map to say it would come in September, September comes along and nothing, they then updated the map to say 1st of January 2012. After this rolled along, they got rid of the map. Apparently it was doing them more harm than good because not only myself, but others in the area phoned to call out their bullshit regarding fibre. It's two years later and still no fibre or cable of any kind in the area. One postcode over? Boom, it's flowing. They got it back in 2013, but not here and BT/Openreach have pretty much went silent on the subject. After speaking with a representative at one of Virgins stores, he told me that my area specifically was left out because BT believed customers here wouldn't buy the product. He also let me know that Virgin wanted to buy the area in order to provide fibre, but because of competition laws, they were denied. Something to do with BT owning the lines.

* The Moment grabs post time-war 10 and 11 to help WAR

What about all the managers that have played him in mid-week Carling/FA cup matches and then played him in the league? Are these managers all clueless too? How is Sturridge going to cope with Champions League? Is Rodgers expected to NEVER play Sturridge after a league game?

1. This is fine, you get an entitlement to have leave, not when you have it.  You're employer can say when you take it and when you can't take it (think teachers, or anyone working in any industry that has times of year where they are a lot busier).

2. Does that 17 days include bank holidays and any dates that are fixed by their calendar?  If you work 5 days a week then yes you have a minimum of 28 days holiday which includes bank holidays, but many work places will have certain days that are fixed, eg bank holidays and some days around Christmas.  So it may be that it's 17 days where you get to pick the date (so long as it's not in the first 3 months).
Or if you're only working a part year then obv it'd be reduced days, or if some weeks you are working fewer than 5 days then it will be reduced.

3. Holiday pay is based on the average hours you work over a 12 week period.

""There was very little discussion of the nature of the relationship between the two sides - that one [the Palestinians] was subject to military control by the other [Israel],"" the report says.
    
Researchers also found a strong emphasis on Israeli casualties on the news despite the number of Palestinian deaths being considerably greater.
And the differences in language used by journalists for both sides were also noted. ""Words such as 'atrocity', 'brutal murder', 'mass murder', 'savage cold blooded killing', 'lynching' and 'slaughter' were used about Israeli deaths but not Palestinian,"" the report said.
""The word 'terrorist' was used to describe Palestinians by journalists but when an Israeli group was reported as trying to bomb a Palestinian school, they were referred to as 'extremists' or 'vigilantes'.""
it also found ""Israelis were quoted more than twice as much as Palestinians in reports"".'

What about people with a decent income who have contributed plenty of tax but with savings? They get no help. It incentivises profligacy.

It's a cap, not a baseline. The current cap is £25k per year. If the cap is minimum wage, any job is better than benefits.

It is for some people. A really sensible one. Get a job stacking shelves and spend all your money on daycare for your kid with no money for food *or* live on benefits, look after your own kid and be able to look after yourself?

I have the great pleasure of working with a couple of hardcore RM fans and listening to them talk about Khedira is just like listening to Chelsea fans talk about Ramires - he isn't technical enough, he screws up simple passes, concedes too many fouls (Ramires actually wins a higher proportion of his attempted tackles, and concedes fewer fouls per tackle - http://imgur.com/y7G1I5m) followed by a grudging acknowledgement of the dirty work he does. 

I just don't see what puts him above Ramires that would justify the big wages he would undoubtedly demand.

We know that they didn't take direct ISIS chartered flights from the UK to Syria.  They mostly seem to have gone via Turkey, and I wouldn't be
surprised if they didn't exactly travel from Turkey to Syria via legitimate channels given their ultimate intentions.  The two countries have a large shared border, which appears to be mostly mountains and desert.  I'm sure they'd have no problem getting into Syria without there being any evidence of their movements, and the same would apply coming back.

So some guy shows up at passport control, who appears to be have been in Turkey for a few months.  What are the border agents going to do?  Deny him entry to his own country because they *suspect* he's been fighting for IS?  The law isn't about what we suspect, it's about what we can prove.  And even if there *is* evidence in his passport that he travelled on to Syria, that still isn't a crime in itself.  Unless these people are stupid enough to actually incriminate themselves, how are we going to prove what they've been up to?

People keep talking about prosecutions, but the British authorities seems to have a hard enough time bringing prosecutions against people who have commited crimes right here in this country (hello Rotherham! *waves*) so what chance do you think they'll have of prosecuting *possible* crimes, which *may* have been committed in a foreign land which seems to have descended into lawless anarchy?  Can you imagine any conviction on that basis holding up for longer than five minutes?

In the case of causing death by careless driving (CDCD), it is sufficient to convict by showing that the driver made a mistake. This is not like ""dangerous driving"" where there has to be proof of severe negligence, such as a driving at an inappropriate speed for a prolonged period of time. The actual consequences of the collision were less important to a prosecution.

The problem with CDCD is that the only relevant factors are the accused's carelessness (a very low bar to proove) and the fact that the deceased is deceased. Negligence or dangerous driving by the deceased is not a mitigation or a defence.

This is taken even further in causing death by unlawful driving (CDUD) for example running someone over while uninsured. It is possible for someone (A) to be driving like a saint, but without insurance, and to collide with a motorist (B) turning into a side road, killing them - A is almost certain to be convicted (as this is a strict liability offence) and is likely to serve a custodial sentence.

I guess there's an underlying need to trust both your child and their friends and good judgement when it comes to leaving your house alone. I have two anecdotes of other horror stories which are both funny and fucking horrible (read on..)

* The first - I threw a new years eve party whilst my parents were staying away from home. All went essentially well, but one kid fell asleep on my parents favorite sofa and yet more friends decided it would be hilarious to cover him (and subsequently the sofa) in flour, smoked salmon, cheeses, biscuits and all sorts of other shite. Cleaning the sofa took ages - could've been worse - but they could've just not done it... 

* The second - the horrible one - my college mates sister threw a party and we were all of a similar age. They had three pet Chinchillas in a cage in the kitchen. Some complete fuck-up (no friend of ours) thought it would be funny to swap their water feeder for vodka. They all died. One of my friends said it was the house owners fault for leaving pets out at a party...! They're not a friend anymore. 

So yes - there's a case for not leaving your house - but the number of house parties gone bad is greatly outweighed by the number of good, minimum damage ones (for me).

Post-2012 loans have an interest rate of RPI + 3% while in-course (currently 5.5% for the next academic year, 6.5% for the previous), this will go down to RPI once you graduate. Once the loan enters repayment the interest is dependent on your income. If you earn under the lower threshold (21,000 for Post-2012 currently) the interest will be RPI. The upper threshold is 42,000 and if you earn over this the interest will be RPI + 3%. These are the two limits and if you fall in between there is a proportional scale.

Agreed. My point was that not getting starts for his country will be dampening his spirits.

&gt;And show me the avoidable errors he's made for Liverpool this year? 

This year? Do you mean this season? This season which is 3 games old?

Last season? He conceded 50 goals mate. That's **fifty**, and some of them were toot, remember Negredo on Boxing Day? He scored off a shot a youthy keeper should've saved!

&gt;Or how about even during that fantastic run we had at the end of last year?

Yeah, he made some great saves. He's a good goalkeeper. I never said he wasn't. the point I was making is that he still has plenty to learn and, as it stands, he's one of our weaker players.

&gt;But people here like to parrot the same shit about ""commanding his area"" while looking past some of the fantastic saves

Firstly, it's not shit. It's a fact. 

Overlooking his frailties in favour of a handful of great instinctive stops doesn't make sense. Football's not a game scored on flair, it's about goals scored and goals conceded, and Mignolet concedes too many.

Statistically he's one of the weak links in the team. Sorry if you don't like it, I mean, I think he's a decent player and a decent lad too, but football's a sport, not a popularity contest.

He made showy cocktails with a shaker and added paper umbrellas and maraschino cherries, salt rims, slivers of lime etcetera. The teenagers loved it all. As they got drunker, the mixologist gradually reduced the alcohol content in their drinks. Conclusion: pricey but worth it.

true,devals,null,null,"Yeah... I put my faith in their insistence that the doctor was still the doctor... until this hideous move (and his callous remarks about Blue's recently dead brother- who he by all rights FAILED to save) on his part unfortunately proved just the opposite. The doctor is supposed to be the ultimate good, and cantankerous is fine, you can be cranky, grouchy and cynical, and still be good- but why are so many people so happy about having a cruel, morally impoverished man with little reverence for human life running around as the Doctor? To me, Capaldi's doctor has sacrificed everything that it means to be the Doctor for the sake of edginess and being 'dark'. Hate it, hate everything about it. 

According to the standards he (and we) always held himself to, this doctor has done nothing but fail at every turn. He couldn't find a peaceful solution in his debut episode (and could hardly be bothered to look for one), and he failed to do so again, even with all the strength of his very soul behind his (reluctant) effort. This doctor is weak; where's the triumph? Why so impressed? His moral fallibility makes his arrogance seem little more than undeserved self-righteousness. It's only been two episodes and I already want to see him either taken down a peg, or the back of him. 

Now this may be intentional set-up on the part of the writers, who perhaps had written themselves into a corner with these last few seasons of ""the Time Lord Triumphant"", but if this is the case, this nuance seems to be lost on the audience, who are too busy clamoring over themselves to heap praise on Capaldi and 12 as the ""dark, edgy, badass Doctor"" they've been craving to notice that he doesn't measure up to the legacy of the character.",0,1409943564,null,0,1409971311,0,cka4tf8,t3_2f113q,t1_cka4tf8,t1_ck4y7ku,null,1427180517,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It allows for Henderson to join Coutinho, or for Coutinho to move up to a 4-2-3-1 system, if we need to attack, and with a midfield trio, it hopefully nullifies Villa's midfield, as they'll likely play a 4-3-3, like they did against Hull.

It also means Lallana and Sterling can exploit the flanks of the 4-3-3 system, so hopefully they pull defenders out, leaving a gap for Coutinho in the middle for a slick pass to Balotelli.

I agree. I think we'll see a bit more of Lambert too. It's not as if we picked him up off the scrap heap, we bought him as a proven Premier League striker and hopefully he will show that.

I know everyone is excited about Balotelli but I'm really hoping that Markovic can get some valuable minutes.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"It is said that the Moment was the last device developed by ancient Gallifreyans (which means this probably occurred right as Rassilon, Omega and possibly the Other created the Time Lord society) but nothing else. We are also never given a concrete origin for the Hand of Omega on the TV show, but it was apparently developed by Rassilon and Omega to harness the powers of time and that the Doctor may or may not have been there at its creation. But we also know it could be used as a weapon. 

It is very possible that they attempted to create a device similar to that of the Moment but without a conscience (although they would have failed). It is also possible that they did not create the Moment but stole it from the ancient Gallifreyans and named it the Hand of Omega.

The fact that both have an affinity for the Doctor at the expense of other Time Lords would suggest that they have similar temperaments so I think it is very possible that if not the same device, that they are related devices. And I think it would actually be cool if they were the same device because it would really strengthen the overarching mythos between Classic and New Who and bring in the possibility of reviving parts of the Cartmel Masterplan. It would also explain why the Doctor seems to be on the level of Rassilon and Omega and why he seems to be the center of many time paradoxes and coincidences.

In my head canon I think that the Doctor is either the Other or in some way has met him and been imparted some memories. I think that the Other knew what Time Lord society would eventually lead to given enough time and prepared for many future possibilities. Around the time that the Doctor was at the academy he realized the possibilities of things going bad as dissatisfaction seemed to grow amongst the youth (especially with the high numbers of renegades that his class generated). For some reason he decided to take the Hand of Omega and remove it, ending up on Earth either because he knew of its future importance in the universe or because of some coincidence. 

This could explain the Doctor's initial affinity for Earth, why the Time Lords would have exiled him on Earth, why the Master was concerned with taking over/destroying the Earth especially while the Doctor was exiled there, why the Daleks also wanted to take over the Earth earlier in the series.

He never wanted anyone to use the Hand of Omega but knew it would eventually fall into the wrong hands so he ensured that once it did there would be no result but ultimate destruction. He wanted the Dalek's destruction to come by their own evil. Even at his craftiest he didn't want to be the one to pull the trigger on the Daleks. If the Hand of Omega is the Moment then that would explain why its reputation went from stellar manipulator (how the Time Lords used it) to galaxy eater (the destruction of the Daleks) and explained how it got its reputation as judging the user.

Whether or not they are the same device, I think using the Moment was the ultimate failure in the Doctor's eyes because he would be no better than either Rassilon/Omega and the Daleks who wanted to use the Hand of Omega to try and control the universe and the laws of time for their own ends. Essentially the Doctor was conceding defeat by saying he had the right to use the same/a similar device to control the universe and the laws of time.",0,1409944719,null,0,false,0,cka5fdw,t3_2fjtpv,t1_cka5fdw,t1_cka1wt2,null,1427180233,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

So what if he's coming off an injury? Plenty of players have injuries and come back just as strong as before they were laid up. His age isn't a factor either. 32 is prime age for a goalie. Experience is beyond valuable. Also, you obviously haven't seen Valdes play if you're willing to mewl about him providing some competition for Mignolet.

Let's not forget that he'll be able to help Mignolet grow as a player too, which will be invaluable to both him and us as a club.

&gt;Especially when the man just kept a fucking clean sheet!

Yeah, he did. He also conceded something like 50 goals last season and some of them were down to his positioning for free-kicks or his lack of control over his area. He also lacks when it comes to distribution and often looks uncomfortable with the ball at his feet.

He's a Liverpool player and for that reason alone he'll get my support, but it's silly to look past his flaws just because you like him. Oh, and it's downright pathetic to be abusive to other supporters and fans, just because they're not lapping at his nut-sack like you.

true,rough_outline,lfc68,,"Sturridge has 2 days of rest since playing against Spurs, in a competitive match, a game where he played 90 minutes. Sturridge then played 88 minutes against Norway, in a friendly.

Sturridge has now got an injury in his thigh, which is a soft muscle, soft muscle injuries are not freak injuries, they are the product of incorrect training methods, fatigue and/or over-use. Roberto Martinez, a man with a degree in physiotherapy once said ""I don’t believe in soft-tissue injuries. If you get a soft-tissue injury in football, a mistake has been made.""

Sturridge shouldn't have played practically the full 90 minutes against Norway, in a friendly, and something has gone wrong in training, if he strained his thigh, either the intensity was too high or Sturridge needed rest.

There's a reason we bought Balotelli, Rodgers wants to be able to rest Sturridge, so he doesn't have to play him every game, so he can rest him without a major drop in quality.

Personally, it's risk vs reward. The more matches a player is exposed to, and the less rest they have, the higher the chance of injury. That is painfully obvious, I don't think anyone would disagree. In an ideal world, every player would get the rest they required, however through the course of a competitive season, ideals are not always compatible with circumstance, so players who aren't fully fit will play, because the risk of injury is outweighed by the reward of victory, it can sometimes be worth risking a player for a win.

There is zero reward for increasing the risk of Sturridge getting injured by playing him for 88 minutes, after he's only had two days of rest for a pointless friendly, which leads him to getting injured two days with a soft muscle injury. Unless you think that Hodgson can learn some great secret with an extra 20/30 minutes, that he doesn't already know from watching Sturridge in all his previous England and club matches.

It just stinks of Hodgson's disgusting attitude of ignorance and arrogance, where he's happy to stick with the same methods that he's used for his entire career, never bothering to improve himself or his methods.

That doesn't explain why every other postcode in Pollok gets it.

&gt;I don't want to trash talk an entire area but from a business perspective, are BT likely to see a greater ROI from Newton Mearns or from Pollok?

Well considering one of the largest high end retail centres in Scotland is here and not in Newton Mearns, I'd say Pollok.

Again, your logic doesn't add up because Pollok already gets fibre... They're just avoiding certain postcodes within Pollok. If my postcode was in a run down area, I'd understand, but the property value here is the highest in the area.

In fact, it's the run down areas that get the fucking fibre! My uncle lives at the other side in one of the most disgusting parts of Pollok and he's sitting at a comfortable 80mb.

This one did, which is why they withdrew it. Just because there are lots of different causes of a disease doesn't mean you want to be exposed to any one of them.

Generally, without regulation, these things are likely to keep happening. Things are going to end up in the juice which are known to be dangerous, simply because the person mixing it doesn't know.

Regarding nicotine, do we actually know the long term dangers of exposure purely to nicotine amongst a large section of the population? How would we know?

It is about choice. I will eat whatever vegetables I like. I will smoke e-cigs or real cigarettes or a big fat cigar if I want to (as it happens, I don't), but I shouldn't impose it on others.

No one was being 'cunty' as you so unpleasantly put it. People were discussing his frailties. Don't like it? Fine. There's no need to be a blert about it though.

I mean, saying 'I don't appreciate the disrespect'? What planet are you on? He's a public figure. When he fucks up, he gets a bit of grief. When he plays well, he gets applause and effusive praise. That's football. What are you, 12?

&gt;I'm done with this conversation.

It needn't have even been a conversation. You could have just realised that you were being spiky with people for not sharing your opinion and unclenched a little bit.

&gt;I asked for more balance and not to slag a player off and I get people telling ME to grow up?

You didn't ask for anything! You made a snarky comment for no reason! Who fucking cares if someone points out Mignolet's weaknesses. He's a sportsman who gets paid an inordinate sum of money to perform, which means he's open to scrutiny.

&gt;You were way more abusive to me than I was to anyone slagging off Mignolet.

Please point out the abuse?

I didn't say **anything** abusive (about you or your BFF, Mignolet).

&gt;I simply said that I didn't like us mocking him

You need to take a deep breath and calm down, man. People get grief in life, it's no big deal. Not only that, but you can't gauge whether any of what was said was intended to be nasty or just a bit of good natured sounding off.

&gt;and you're saying that I'm on his nuts, mewling over him.

Saying 'I don't appreciate the disrespect' and then calling someone a cunt for, well, nothing at all, suggests that you aren't exactly thinking straight. Blindly refusing to acknowledge the man's shortcomings adds to it.

You can offer creative criticism without hating someone you know. And a bit of well intentioned mockery isn't the end of the world.

&gt;Your first reaction was to insult me

I did no such thing! I tried to lighten the fucking mood because you were being needlessly shitty with people.

&gt;You replied to me calling for calm with more name calling.

What name calling? Again, I did no such thing! Not only are you off the reservation over people having a bit of a dig at a goalkeeper, but you're a fucking liar too.

My comment in response to your 'calling for calm' (which was ludicrous) was:

""*You don't appreciate the 'disrespect'? He's not your Da, is he?
I didn't see any disrespect myself. I saw people discussing a player and his form, and appropriately giving him a little bit of a slagging for his mistakes.*""

Where's the name calling? Where's the insults?

&gt;Maybe you're the one who should grow up

Right, but broadband service is based on where you live not where you shop. I shop there from time to time, but I don't live anywhere near the area.

&gt; They're just avoiding certain postcodes within Pollok

Why would they do that though?

They will be sitting on commercial intelligence that helps them identify the areas that will be most likely to take up fibre and those areas are naturally going to be the target for investment.

It wouldn't really make sense to single out a particular post code or two for spiteful treatment unless the information showed a likely poor commercial return or there was some technical difference that meant that those streets wouldn't be included in the same roll out project.

I don't know if the link I posted was for your nearest exchange or not, but it could be as subtle as line length, different exchanges or even some variance in the street cabinets that meant that those streets weren't done at the same time.

The part about ""commanding his area"" being shit, is that it doesn't matter so long as he is making saves and not conceding a lot from corners. Even then, that is something that he is not directly in control of. Making saves is a better metric, for me, and Migs made 75 saves--more than Cech, Hart, and 1 less than Szczesny. De Gea and Lloris made more saves, but they played behind worse defenses, so likely got more opportunities.

A funny thing to note is that Mignolet had more punches than Cech, De Gea, Howard, Szczesny and Hart, only bettered by Lloris. Yet, here we are again, speaking of him commanding his area and how it is detrimental to Liverpool.

Mignolet is certainly not the best keeper in the world--that's for sure. But he is no more a weak spot than our defenders were last year. And as a GK, the difference is that your defenders can make 76 serious mistakes, you can compensate for 35 of them, and still you can get beaten 30 times just from their mistakes. That doesn't count brilliant goals or your own mistakes. It is an unforgiving position, and I think this thread indicates excellently how selective the memories of fans can be.

true,bockers7,lfc99,,"First off let me add that Valdes is a good keeper and he's still only 32 years old. At least another solid 4 years are expected from him. 

But I was going to say the same. If he was a top keeper other teams would be vying for his services. He was never that good, at least in my opinion. He is not gonna come here and all of a sudden be 10x better than Mignolet. Maybe he's a bit better but that's mostly due to his distribution and experience. His in the air ability has always been quite weak. Saying he is top 4 is crazy in my opinion. He was never even in the top 8 in his prime. Just the way I look at it. 

Before anyone asks, his prime was somewhere between 05/06 and 10/11. Buffon, Casillas, Van der Sar, Cech were always top 4, so he was never there. Then Julio Cesar, Reina, Dida, Lehmann all had better primes. 

At best Valdes in his prime compared to other keeps in their prime was 8th in the world. And that doesn't take into account Kahn from 05 through 08, Neuer and Llorris in 10-11, and Abbondanzieri at Valencia during his time there. 

So no, Valdes is not on TOP CLASS level of goalkeepers, but he is very good and we need good strong coverage back there. ",0,1409950722,null,0,false,0,cka8ico,t3_2fk22v,t1_cka8ico,t1_cka0gk0,null,1427178726,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

* /u/IanCal identifies the best NISA rate is 1.55%
* A [basic current account] will most likely get you 2.7%+ (income &lt; £10k, assumed student/stipend), and definately *a minimum* of 1.5% (income &gt;£42k).

To explain this a bit more: If you don't pay tax because your income is less than £10k, there is no tax advantage to NISAs, just compare the headline APRs and fees (you can get up to [5%] with no fee). If you're a normal taxpayer (earning between £10k and £42k), then you multiply by 0.8 to get the interest rate you receive (4% for the best account with no fee, 2.4% for the easy account above with £24 fee).

I suggested the Santander account first because it's the least hassle to set up (has the highest balance threshold) and if you take advantage of it's other benefits (paying bills), then you can even beat the fee.

&gt; The constitutional position in a situation of no overall control is clear.  When no party holds the majority of seats, the incumbent Prime Minister has the first call on forming a government, either as a minority administration or by building a coalition with another party or parties.

In practice I don't know of any election when it would have made a difference, it's as much a formality as whether the Queen is asking the PM to form a government or the PM is asking permission. There'll be exactly one person with a chance of commanding the confidence of the Commons, so the order that people try to form a government doesn't really matter. If the incumbent PM doesn't resign and tries to form a minority government when the other parties have negotiated a coalition with a majority, the coalition can pass a vote of no confidence to force the PM to resign and allow them to take over.

The only practical effect is that the incumbent is still PM while negotiations are taking place, until it becomes clear that someone else is better placed to form a government and he resigns.",0,1409953472,null,0,false,0,cka9tcm,t3_2ffeao,t1_cka9tcm,t1_cka535f,null,1427178117,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Newsletter hit a nerve,, hes some more truths .

Ireland is an island to the west of Britain but Northern Ireland is just off
the mainland - not the Irish mainland, the British mainland.

The capital of Ireland is Dublin. It has a population of a million people,
all of whom will be shopping in Newry this afternoon. They travel to Newry
because it is in the North, which is not part of Ireland, but still pay in
Euros.

Under the Irish constitution, the North used to be in Ireland, but a
successful 30-year campaign of violence for Irish unity ensured that it is
now definitely in the UK. Had the campaign lasted longer the North might
now be in France.

Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland. It has a population of half a
million, half of whom have houses in Donegal. Donegal is in the north but
not in the North. It is in the South. No, not the south, the South.

There are two parliaments in Ireland. The Dublin parliament is called the
Dáil, (pronounced ""Doyle""), an Irish word meaning a place where banks
receive taxpayers' money. The one in Belfast is called Stormont, an
Anglo-Saxon word meaning placebo, or deliberately ineffective drug.

Their respective jurisdictions are defined by the border, an imaginary line
on the map to show fuel launderers where to dump chemical waste.
Protestants are in favour of the border, which generates millions of pounds
in smuggling for Catholics, who are opposed to it.

Travel between the two states is complicated because Ireland is the only
country in the world with two M1 motorways. The one in the North goes west
to avoid the south and the one in the South goes north to avoid the price of
drink.

We have two types of democracy in Ireland. Dublin democracy works by
holding a referendum and then allowing the government to judge the result.
If the government thinks the result is wrong, the referendum is held again.
Twice in recent years the government decided the people's choice was wrong
and ordered a new referendum.

Belfast democracy works differently. It has a parliament with no
opposition, so the government is always right. This system generates envy
in many world capitals, especially Dublin.

Ireland has three economies - northern, southern and black. Only the black
economy is in the black. The other two are in the red.

All versions of the IRA claim to be the real IRA but only one of them is the
Real IRA. The North's biggest industry is the production of IRAs.
Consequently, we now have the Provisional, Continuity and Real IRA. The Real
IRA is by far the most popular among young graffiti writers simply because
it is the easiest to spell. ",0,1409953944,null,0,false,0,ckaa18i,t3_2fgvpz,t1_ckaa18i,t3_2fgvpz,null,1427178014,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Most of the people I know generally like Moffat and dislike Davies and vice versa. Really I think it just comes down to stylistic choices. Personally I find both to be equally exciting but for different reasons.

RTD's era seemed a little bit more unpredictable and tonally varied which always kept you on your toes for what could happen next. I enjoyed how his season arcs generally started out more subtly and built up (Bad Wolf, DoctorDonna/Song is coming to an end, You are not alone). I think it gives  a more gentle mystery that sticks in the back of your mind and worries you, makes you feel like nervous like something bad is going to happen, something that you hope the Doctor can stop but you really don't know if he can.

Moffat's era is more like a giant nested puzzle box where the mysteries are more in your face than subtle. Generally the feel was the same from episode to episodes and many of the episodes tied back specifically to the overarching plot. This makes it feel like you are trying find out where a massive leak is or where a line of thread goes, it feels a bit more explosive like a bomb will go off any minute but you don't know it is there so you don't fear it necessarily but you are prepared.

So it really depends on if you like a slow burn where each episode is individually exciting and the entire season arc is relatively mute or whether you like each episode to be relatively mute with an explosive season arc.

Which makes this new season interesting because it seems like Moffat may actually doing a more subtle mystery dropping crumbs ala Davies rather than the major plot threads. I mean so far its not like The Eleventh Hour where it pretty much sets up the entire mythos in one episode (the crack, Pandorica will open, Silence will fall). So far all we got is Missy bringing people up to heaven but the Doctor doesn't even know that yet.

My big objection is from the people doing things like what this post is trying to do--act like he's an amazing signing and we're getting a top player. He's old, coming off a serious injury (the injury part is what we said about Falcao once he went to United, mind you), and he wasn't wanted by many clubs, which makes me think he's asking for a very high wage. 

We can be excited about having someone like him competing for the #1 spot. But we don't need to lie to ourselves--he isn't a savior, and we don't need to act like he's far better than he is.

Virgin Galactic have already done test flights to &gt;100km altitude so looks like anyone who goes on a virgin galactic flight will, go to space. 

But you're right, it can't boost into low earth orbit, but why would you want to? LEO starts at 160km, you don't really get much more for going out that far, at 100km you get weightlessness, so that's your big 'I'm in space' tickbox done, well what else do you get? 

Well the view, the view from that height will be epic, when James May said [going into the U2 spy plane changed the way he saw the world](http://youtu.be/1PmYItnlY5M?t=6m35s), that was great, but he was only at 21km height, that's nothing, SSO is going to at least 100.

So the choice would be redesign it now, add in the requisite machinery, change the layout to make an angled deck and then buy the aircraft. Then when the time is right, sell the f-18s and buy most likely the F-35C anyway. There is a reason the yanks are looking to move past the F-18, even the Australians only want them as stop gap measures and supplementing a force of F-35s with electronic warfare and that sort of stuff. We'd then end up ripping out the steam catapults and put on electric ones anyway.

He was horrible last 2 years and now that he's had one okay game people are rating him. He's got bad vision on the field, poor pass completion and shit shot selection. He ruins our forward momentum in the midfield. Often he passes the ball at or behind a player instead of in front of a player who is in stride and it fucks us. It's why Fabregas is such a breath of fresh air. 

The reason why the back of our midfield was the section that needed repair last year was because it was missing a player as Ramires was a black hole of poor quality. We got Fabregas and now we look better. 

It baffles me how many people think Ramires is good. In /r/chelseafc people will defend the guy, but if you go into /r/soccer you'll get a much more accurate perception of him as a player. In fact I'm sure people on the main subreddit would rather we play him as it'd make our team weaker. Just a lack of overall technical skill. I think people just remember Barcelona and it gave them the impression that he was good.

The most important thing to understand that property is not an investment, it's a **business** (that you invest in).

Name them. Preferably countries with similar population spread as the UK, and not countries where everyone is in densely populated cities (e.g. Romania).

&gt; The fact is, our infrastructure (compared with other nations) is a joke, and I wonder if that's due to privatisation, lack of government funding, or other issues. 

All of them. The BDUK programme has some pitifully low target of 2Mbps or something. The government wants to be seen to do something, so it hands money to BT to roll out FTTC which is ""good enough for now"" but not for the future. If they had any foresight they'd mandate FTTP for their money. In a few years we'll probably be in a situation where FTTC isn't cutting it and BT wants more money to finish the job to do FTTP.

BT doesn't appear to be getting it either, hence the use of FTTC primarily (although they have built it with FTTP in mind). They seem to be looking at pole-mounted DSLAMs as the upgrade path, which seems utterly pointless when you can just run the fibre into the home for another few metres and never have to do it again.

I'd love to see the government build an FTTP network from scratch (or getting BT to build/manage one but with the state owning it), but that'd require spending money.",0,1409962071,null,0,1409962359,0,ckadhve,t3_2fkd82,t1_ckadhve,t1_ckadfgx,null,1427176399,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They never really took to naval aviation, which I guess is probably due to the fact that they never had any serious colonial presence, lacked a huge amount of coast, and spent the post war period being more worried about a Soviet land invasion.  

&gt; Buddy tanks are a basic necessity at this point...

Even the Americans have issues with naval mid-air refueling, the Viking was retired in '09 and they use F18's in a ""strike tanker"" config now. For serious refueling they rely on the USAF which is one of the reasons they have bases all over the planet. 

I would say that the F35C using with buddy tanks and a similar ""strike tanker"" role combined with that modernized C3 that Lockheed is pitching would be a good fit, but CATOBAR... So I think our only serious option at this point is looking into a modified V-22 as a COD/tanker. 

As for what we should have done, personally I would have argued for the carriers to be equipped with reactors and stuck with the F35C. Expensive yes, but as a long term investment I think it has a lot more potential than using a navalized 4.5th gen. The alternative would be to ditch carriers entirely and gone in with the Americans on a larger fleet of America class amphibious assault ships running F35B's and V-22's.

Right. Doing drunk maths. Using these as sources:

http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds

For reference the UK is at place 53 in terms of density (i.e. pretty damned dense) and at place 13 in terms of internet speed. 

Denmark are slightly faster than us (12), but at position 88 of most dense countries compared to our 53.

USA is 0.6 MB faster (3 places up the table) than us but over 100 places behind us (at 179) in terms of population density.

Finland has *way* worse population distribution (203) and comparable internet speeds (place 14 below at 9.1). And they're laying another core network ATM so will soon kick the crap out of us.

Sweden are, obviously, way more distributed than us (193), yet have a better speed (7).

The Czech republic are faster than both Sweden and Finland (at 6!) and *still* less dense than us (84).

So. 

&gt;Name them. Preferably countries with similar population spread as the UK, and not countries where everyone is in densely populated cities (e.g. Romania).

Done.

That's basically it. Davies is a talented drama writer, and wrote Doctor Who more as a drama than sci-fi.... and I think that's where most people have a problem with him. When he started doing the sci-fi bits, it got really cheesy.

But then you watch something like Midnight and it blows everything else he's written out of the water.

Moffat is a little more balanced, but I think tends to come off a bit more flat when it comes to drama. Like you said, Davies' characters were more rounded and better written. Davies is a better character writer, and it's sort of for that reason why liked his Doctors better... even if 11 is largely my favorite.

I think the best way to compare the two writers is to watch Midnight and Blink. Moffat can write the scary in-your-face monster. Davies can write the inner monster of the average human.

The buddy tanks is still your best option for an expeditionary force, the RN can use RAF tankers later but until they have somewhere to operate from they need a solution.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"Oh I know there is more to it then just that but on the surface most people  I know who like Doctor Who seem to gravitate towards one or the other. But I can say that as the arcs of Moffat's tenure bled into each successive season some of my friends lost interest. It becomes difficult to hold all those threads because there is only so much time and mental focus with which to address them.

I think Doctor Who's greatest strength and biggest weakness is actually its own conceits. So many episodes start out with great promise but are dragged down by the resolutions to problems. And with a show that literally leaves you with an infinite amount of ways to solve a problem, it is never going to satisfy everyone and the more plot threads you try to weave into the story, the more difficult it becomes to maintain them and conclude them all together satisfyingly.

This is why quite a few of the episodes that are universally considered the best have straightforward mysteries or plots often with either little resolution or a strong denouncement (even if time travel come into play): Blink/Midnight for the former and Caves of Androzani/The Silurians for the latter. Anything that meets the middle grounds seems to cause the most disagreement across the fandom.

When it comes to Moffat, I am pretty sure he never wanted to solve every question he has said in interviews that a character is only real when it has secrets from its writer/creator and has also said that he has intentionally left gaps for future people to pick up (in particular reference to Big Finish). In fact he pretty much addressed the main mysteries he asked in The Eleventh Hour: the Pandorica, Silence will fall, the cracks in the universe. He even showed us who River Song was. Whether or not people like or agree with these answers is up to each one as an individual.

Honestly I don't mind if everything is or is not answered as I have a pretty healthy head canon. Not that I discount what I don't like but rather that I love the gaps and the inconstancies because it challenges my own notions on the show.

The entire time they talk about the day they did it, it is always in concrete terms. They know what they did that day, they saw it. There is no way that they could remember the moment Gallifrey burned so exactly if they were all there to save it.

However from the universe's perspective he never did destroy Gallifrey and the Daleks (who mostly destroyed themselves) and instead saved Gallifrey. So basically the Moment limited the destruction of Gallifrey and the Daleks to the Doctor's timeline only. He survived the Time War because he had destroyed everyone. But the Moment saw that the Doctor did not wish to use it but alone there was nothing else he could do. 

She then gave the Doctor a chance to make the choice by pulling in the Doctor's from the future who had actually experienced using the Moment. She wanted to know if the Doctor was still capable of the decision after seeing who he would become. And he still decided there was no other way, that is until the three of them came to the shack together. 

So until Eleven made that final decision not to use the Moment, to the Doctor he had destroyed Gallifrey and it was in his past. But through the Moment he was able to save Gallifrey for his future incarnations. I would say this is further confirmed by the fact that he dies on Trenzalore in the future before The Day of the Doctor and does not after The Day of the Doctor.

Not only did the Doctor come to terms with using the Moment and heal his broken hearts of his failure to save Gallifrey, but he was also able to actually save Gallifrey because the Moment had seen all the stuff he had done after destroying Gallifrey and judged him to be a good man despite all the terrible things he faced (including his own demons) because even up to the end of things he always tried to be a good man (even if he stumbled along the way).

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"This is mostly my wildest dreams come true theory concerning the Valeyard and how I really wish they could bring him in for Capaldi’s run even though I know that in my heart of hearts it will never happen. But if Moffat were to actually do this I think it would be a master class in bridging the gap between Classic and New Who. I should also note as a disclaimer though that I have yet to read the scripts or see the leaked episodes so this assessment occurs with no foreknowledge of the upcoming season.

So first rewind time to The Trial of a Time Lord serials where we discover that the Valeyard is an amalgamation of the Doctor’s darker nature between his twelfth and final incarnation. The choice of words here were in no way deliberate (and yes I am reading into them), but based on recent events in the Doctor’s life, they could actually take on a different meaning. Matt was technically only the eleventh named doctor, but with the revelation of the War Doctor this actually makes him the twelfth “incarnation” (David Tennant’s crisis regeneration leaves him with the same incarnation). 

Now there are two further separate assumptions that can be made:

* On the terms of a full regeneration cycle this makes Matt Smith both the twelfth and final incarnation. If we take the Master’s statement to mean from the start of the twelfth to the end of the final incarnations (as he was not there to know that Matt’s Doctor was both so he assumed that this meant two doctors instead of one), then this could actually point to the Dream Lord being the genesis of the Valeyard (with further hints and a mention of the Valeyard being made later).

* On the terms of Matt being the twelfth incarnation and the final occurring sometime in his new regeneration cycle may still allows for the selection of the Dream Lord as the genesis of the Valeyard (who he becomes as a result of the new regeneration cycle).

In regards to the Dream Lord we know that he is a voice given to the Doctor’s darker nature. The Doctor even says that he knows who the Dream Lord is because there is only one other person in the universe that hates him that much. Some can take this to mean himself, however, the only person who ever seemed to truly hate the Doctor and all he stood for was the Valeyard. In the end of Amy’s Choice we find out that the incident was caused by psychic pollen, but with the flash of the Dream Lord in the mind’s eye of the Doctor, it is clear that the Dream Lord is still in there somewhere.

We already have ideas that Series Eight is going in a slightly darker direction. We also know that Moffat has said that there will be no Master (although Moffat lies more often than the Doctor). Personally I think this is the perfect time to bring back the Valeyard as we know that this Doctor will be doing some soul searching over whether or not he is still a good man, something he has always tried to be even in the Time War. To be confronted by his darker nature either in a mental or physical version of the Valeyard could elevate the narrative.

With the Doctor’s memories, the Valeyard could pretend to be a future incarnation of the Doctor at first and trick the Doctor into doing something bad. If he has some control over his appearance, he could take the form of the current Doctor and fool other people into thinking he’s the real one. If still trapped in his mind, the Valeyard could taunt the Doctor or distort his version of reality from within.

And even if the Master is brought back we already know that he finds the Valeyard to be a far more dangerous an enemy than the Doctor so it could lead to interesting interactions between the Doctor and the Master. It could lead to them being truly and honestly allied for the first time in their lives or the Doctor could make another deal with the devil as he had in Logopolis to fight the Valeyard.

Edit: When it comes to how the Valeyard became a semi-separate entity I also think that this could be as a result of the excess amount of energy that the new cycle of regenerations gave him. If he had been growing in the Doctor's mind he could have essentially stole some of that energy himself, but is therefore still tied to the Doctor.

And as for the Valeyard discussing his origins, I don't think he would tell anyone the full truth about how he came to be because that would threaten his own existence.

Stop comparing our lack of activity with world class players to other clubs.""

I don't agree with that quote at all. Once the new stadium is built, revenue will be increased in a very big way. Combine that with the whole of the NDP - hotels, Sainsbury's, offices, aquarium, zoo, free range no-GMO chicken farm, spaceport, auto manufactory, a reflecting pool for everyone to gather and solemnly ponder the immense depths of Arsenal's shittiness, whatever else is in it - and the club will be raking in the cash. 

Once all those investments start generating revenue, I can't see ENIC wanting to sell what will be an increasingly profitable asset unless they get a completely absurd bid. 

Also, I'd just like to point out that our shirt sponshorship deals keep being 1-2 year, short-term deals. Once the stadium goes up, and when we make the CL, a new deal will be signed for the crazy 10 year, 1 billion pound bullshit that our competing top-4 teams are increasingly getting.

Anyway, the article is correct in saying that we are basically in a building mode until the stadium is built, but I also think it's incorrect to assume ENIC will keep being stingy sods after that. They've wanted to run a profitable, or at least close to no-loss club. No shame in that. They've spent what they take in, more or less. Once the revenue picks up, it's reasonable to expect them to spend more.",0,1409969546,null,0,false,0,ckagdza,t3_2flcz5,t1_ckagdza,t3_2flcz5,null,1427173989,14,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,14

Everytime Mikel's name pops up you hear about how solid defensively he is and how he can lock down a midfield late in the game.

Also, this is a big misconception. One of the best DMs I have ever been blessed to see for us, and one of the best *ever* was Makelele. When he was on the pitch, you definitely noticed. The best DM are always constantly making interceptions, winning the ball back, and distributing the ball quickly and efficiently. You have to be blind to not notice it.

* Atletico have a policy of signing younger players and selling them for profit. Oblak is probably viewed as the longer term option, Moya something of a stopgap. Wages likely play a part.  
* He would never in a million years go to Madrid  
* Pellegrini managed Caballero at Malaga, has a history of signing players he has worked with before.  
* Ospina fits the Arsenal mould; fairly young, from a French team, cheap transfer. Arsene seems happy enough with Szczesny, he did get the golden glove last season. Ospina is currently benched.
* Napoli signed Andujar in January and loaned him back for the rest of the season.  Edit: meant to add, Valdes announced he was leaving in May e: nvm finding articles from much earlier. I'll leave it for posterity. So I suppose it's possible Napoli could have gone for him, but does he want to go there? And their choice has experience in Italy.

All these deals were tied up fairly early in the transfer window, if not before, at a time when the extent of Valdes' injury on his ability was much less clear than it presumably is now. It's still not certain how strongly he will come back from such a long lay-off. A few things are for sure, we're not a club that will offer the amounts that many of those clubs would offer, we are a club with a track record of taking risks on transfers and of those risks, at least recently, paying off more often than not. One other thing is for sure; Valdes played 12 seasons as first choice keeper at one of the most successful clubs in history during one of its most illustrious periods, and kept his place under six different managers e: five, though Van Gaal might have done better with Valdes between the sticks. To me that is 100% worth the risk that he might have lost a little of his cutting edge, which is not even certain.

true,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; We could get to the stage where we actually eliminate crime and most danger but find life dull and meaningless because of it.

Ignoring the first part, as I don't think crime cam ever be eliminated, many people do find life dull and meaningless.

But are we happier in general? I would argue that yes we are. 

Back before technology vastly increased the amount of free time we have, most of our waking hours were dedicated to the acquisition of food and survival. 

Even during the middle ages and up to the industrial revolutuon, we (commoners) spent most of our day dedicated to the production of food or other items we could trade for food.

It is only over the past 100 years or so that working hours have gone down, and people have more free time than ever.

This large amount of free time is both what makes some people happy, and others contemplate the meaningless of life.

 People deal with free time in different ways. Giving the average person large amounts of free time has different effects on each individual, similar to certain drugs. Some people choose to find things to do with their free time that makes them happy. Others choose to fixate on the loneliness of existence and pointlessness of it all.

true,Kougi,null,null,"This seems like a good answer. My Father left the UK in the 80s. He grew up closer to Cheltenham. Before I came to study in Bristol, he continuously told me that it was a dirty industrial city with little to no redeeming qualities. Telling me stories of the harbour generally not even allowing kids near it due to pollution, surrounded by slums - a city prone to riots, poverty and squatters. In his eyes, growing up, it was seen as a purely industrial city, with St Pauls riots being one of his primary memories of the city.

Last year he came to visit and was blown away by how clean and modern the city was. He couldn't believe how touristy the harbourside was, when the last time he visited it was in the 70s/early 80s. He recalled it being a smog filled mess.

I personally love the city. From the massive parks dotted around to the lovely cycling routes.
It feels like a very liberal and progressive city. Where you can work an office job wearing your most casual clothes.

That said, I think even people who have lived in Bristol for a decent amount of time still have misconceptions about parts of the city/outer areas.

Fishponds, for example - Many Bristolians I've met insist that it's the rough slums of the city, and that you're certain to be mugged if you take a stroll late at night.
Having lived in Fishponds, I never saw that side of it. It has a few wacky characters due to nursing homes (due to its close proximity to Glenside and abundance of nursing graduates).

However, from my experience, Fishponds is mostly comprised of retired people and uni students. It's well connected to both the city and UWE, with one supermarket too many. Rent prices in greater fishponds are soaring, and landlords are returning to renovate their houses. Its been going through a phase of gentrification for awhile now, yet many people still refer to it as the dangerous slums, despite not having been near the area for 10 years.",0,1409981746,null,0,false,0,ckakohg,t3_2fkguy,t1_ckakohg,t1_cka3ovw,null,1427171896,16,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,16

Ukraine isn't a NATO member state. They aren't even members of the EU. We can help them by providing diplomatic and economic support, but, beyond that? 

Ukraine really isn't our fight. And, put brutally, they're not worth risking World War 3 over. 

Kiev isn't worth risking nuclear missiles flattening Warsaw and Riga. *Nothing* short of a full-on attack on a NATO member state is worth that risk. 

Nukes change everything. NATO getting involved in pitched battle with Russia is a terrifying prospect for both sides, and Putin knows exactly how far Russia can push it- as do we, on our part.

true,roobens,lfc87,null,"They're not important in cold, practical terms any more, unless you're a team like Man United that struggles to qualify for Europe via the league. But there's a lot of romance and history behind the FA cup, which is the world's oldest football competition. Although you may not be aware, the early stages of the FA cup started last month, as teams from as low as the tenth tier of the league system have to play through 4 rounds before even getting to the real first round where the professional league teams from the three tiers below the PL enter. What this means is that every now and then you get a cup run from some tiny football team, and if they make it to the third round they could even play at Anfield or at some other big team like Man City, or even at a more lowly venue like Old Trafford. These unpredictable teams and history are what gives the FA cup its mystique and mostly teams would give it a high priority. 

The league cup is a bit of a joke for the upper echelon teams nowadays for sure. Basically the top PL teams just use it as a testing ground for youth, which tends to eliminate most of the big teams early on. Nowadays the LC final tends to be a mid/low table PL club and a highly ranked Championship club, although if one of the big PL teams' youth manage to get them through to the semi-final then often you'll see more resources and attention lavished upon in since at that point it's a reasonable proposition to win the thing without too much squad rotation in your first XI. Silverware is silverware after all, and everyone enjoys lifting a trophy even when all other fans say it's Mickey Mouse (which of course it is if any of our rivals win it). 

So basically for me I'd love us to win either, but in terms of its importance I wouldn't be willing to sacrifice much in terms of league performance to do so. Obviously neither of them is worth dropping out of the top 4 for, but I think I'd take a 4th placed finish and an FA cup over a third place finish and no FA cup. Others may not, but that's my opinion. The FA cup definitely still means something to most people.

If a company employs someone in the UK they are subject to UK employment legislation.  This includes the PAYE regulations.  It may be the case that where a company is in another country this is unenforceable, but they're still subject to the law.  *(The UK and the US have reciprocal arrangements which means the IRS could be asked to pursue it if it was worth the effort.)*

&gt; Do you think the Inland Revenue is going to say to your buddy, ""no, not your fault"" when he does have assets here, when they're able to attach his earnings for the rest of his life, until they've seized every penny they think they're owed?
&gt; The tax man does not give a fuck about the technicalities you're spouting - I'm sorry to be so blunt, it's probably due to my own experience in this matter that I'm incredulous of you.

The law is **all** about technicality.  Even if you were right the Tax Tribunals service would throw out assessments based on the company liabilities in a heartbeat  The only way to attach the liabilities of the company to an individual would require among other things that the guy was a director of the company.

You had a bad experience.  But you're working on the same sort of basis as a beaten wife who thinks all men beat women.

&gt; Your friend is de facto a business, a service-provider doing whatever he does on a contract basis.
&gt; Your friend is, de facto, self-employed.
&gt; This company in America does not give a fuck about PAYE or payslips - they're not obliged to deal with any of that under American law, the law under which they operate.
&gt; The American company obviously will have to account for these payments on their books, but the US IRS does not care that they're not treating your buddy as an employee, because he's not in their jurisdiction - as far as they're concerned, he's a foreign company providing a service.

If you want more pubs and bar crawl locations then you're better down Albert road. Get off the train at fratton for this and walk straight down fawcett road. 5 minute walk and you're on Albert. There are loads of pubs: the one eyed dog, the fat fox, little Johnny Russell's and the deco is not far. There is also many bars and cosy little venues such as wedgewood rooms, the atrium, the vaults and many like it. Mostly second years onwards down Albert road.... 

If you're after the slightly more 'upper class' night out then get off the train at Portsmouth harbour and check out gunwarf. There's a great casino, loads of bars and a tiger tiger. Mostly locals and some students around this area, it's a bit more expensive but can be a good night out.

* The first carrier won't be sea worthy until the end of 2017, but will then need to undergo extensive sea trials to get the ""ship"" part of the carrier established. Obviously these are two very new large ships that employ radically new technologies particularly in areas like engine management and weapon handling. Establishing safe new working practices for these areas will be needed before anyone starts thinking about embarking aircraft. 

* The second stage will then be limited air operations to get the ""airport"" side of the carrier established. The F35B is a new aircraft which will undoubtedly come with its own teething issues - and aircraft like the UK Licensed Apache helicopter have not previously been used extensively at sea, but are likely to be used on these new carriers since they replace our old amphibious warfare/helicopter platform.

Basically, the first carrier will be ready at roughly the same time as the aircraft are ready. At the moment a lot of people are catastrophising about the F35B in the media, but most defense analysts seem to think the project has overcome its initial hurdles and is now on track to deliver a very solid jet. Its actually very convenient for the Royal Navy, since the dynamics of air warfare have changed immeasurably over the last 5 years as drones have improved. There are now a lot of defense commentators calling for a much smaller contingent of F35Bs (perhaps as few as 40 in total) with a much larger proportion of new advanced drones like a navalised **[BAE Taranis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Taranis)**. These are ""drones"" but unlike early drones (like the [MQ9 Reaper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper) for example) these are more like multirole fighters with advanced performance capabilities and without pilot systems come at a much lower unit cost.

The bottom line is I think these two new carriers have worked out really well for us. We've dodged the bullet of jumping for nuclear power which is expensive and has few additional benefits over the much cheaper diesel electric generators. We've also gone for our own design which cuts crew requirements drastically, even compared with the new Gerald R. Ford class US carriers by automating many ship processes. As far as the F35B goes it'll either work out or it won't. Either way we'll have ""some"" aircraft as opposed to ""none"" which is currently the case. Besides, the F35B is only likely to be embarked for maybe 15 years... perhaps much less.

This guy should be in prison most likely if due diligence was done. I imagine this is also the least shady of the things we know about him. I live near here and from chatting to people in the wetherspoons up next to it and the stuff you hear is awful. There are a lot of very disaffected people living hear Highbury &amp; islington including a seriously diverse ethnic makeup of very poor people.

It's going to seem slightly skewed but there is an incredibly serious issue with councils &amp; the police not enforcing rules against non british/non white business owners (think back to the days of the Krays when this was last true in London for the  that ethnic group).

To be fair to the councils &amp; police are rightfully intimidated by these groups. They are dangerous and well organised and operate in pretty similar ways to gangsters of old but with greater impunity because the authorities don't want to seem racist (when really no one except media would think that to be true) as well as having little to no way of unravelling the complexity of their operations. As well as that when put in a legally compromising  position they just flee the country.

This applies to ""businesses"" like this one related to property/immigration scams/drugs/prostitution/money lending (a very common business) &amp; associated enforcing which form the core parts of the empires of the modern day media shy London gangsters.

More mainstream examples of the issues with councils enforcing rules are with restaurants. I have part ownership &amp; investment in 3 cafe/restaurants in London. Councils are very strict about enforcing the licensing laws and the penalties were huge as were the day to day running costs (rates/commercial taxes/insurances/employment costs etc). Talking to other business owners on the same high street as one place (in E london) they clearly were not incurring most of these overheads  (their restaurant was opening till 4am+ in the morning despite that being entirely contrary to the licensing laws awarded to them. In a different area (Brick Lane) almost all the restaurants breach licensing laws and yet no fines are levied and no licenses revoked. You can be sure if it was my partners that wouldn't be the case. 

Trying to bootstrap a profitable business in London and playing by the rules is nearly impossible

&gt;The short answer is that companies vary. Some operate profits and pay premiums to the government, others the opposite.

The government actually makes money when these companies turn a profit, same if they were nationalised.

The profits are tiny too, the biggest I can see is South West Trains	 with £47.5 million, but the average is about £15 million, barely worth it. If the government nationalised the railways like TFL is effectively nationalised, I bet ticket prices would be exactly the same, maybe even higher, TFL has quite high prices.

There are two new aircraft carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth which has been partly built and can now float, but the interior still needs completing and won't be ready **for sea trials** until 2017, and probably not for operations until 2020. The other ship HMS Prince of Wales is under construction for entry into service probably around 2022, possibly later... and is still in a very early stage of development.

We sold our Harrier II jets to the US because we knew there would be a gap with no carriers and could make contingencies to cover those few years. It probably wasn't ideal but it did save a lot of money, at a time when as you know we need money.

HMS Ocean (our helicopter carrier) was retired last month, and HMS Illustrious (carrier) in July. HMS Invincible and HMS Ark Royal of course were retired in 2011.

The decision to go ahead with HMS PoW is excellent, and we all basically knew it was going to happen anyway - they just hadn't committed to it.

    A second reason, however, was that I am indebted to the British welfare state; the very one that Mr Cameron would like to replace with charity handouts. When my life hit rock bottom, that safety net, threadbare though it had become under John Major’s Government, was there to break the fall.

I really don't get this association you have made between neo-conservatives (who I think you are best describing) and Putin.

Also, are you implying that people argue that Russia is some kind of model that the UK should emulate when it comes to migration and ethnic groups? I have never seen that myself.

What I will say about these Rotherham scandal (which I assume you are referring to), it did show something systemic and rotten in the various institutions that should safeguard certain peoples. Which is horrifying and something will need to be done.

They need to get some serious interior designers in and make the space work.

For a start if you raise the bed into a loft bed, that'll open up A THIRD of the floor space (3m^2). With proper structural cantilever supports, you wouldn't need a supporting pole in the corner, and it could be 'floating'.

With some clever thinking, the toilet space can become a shower/toilet combo - I've seen student lets that make use of airplane-like fibreglass cabins to contain them.

The kitchenette (and basically the whole flat) needs a hardcore extractor fan system in place.

Bulky things like hoovers, brooms, wash baskets, suitcases, and so on can be fixed onto the wall using integrated shelves and large hooks, or be redesigned to be collapsible. Instead of knife blocks, you have magnet strips on the wall. Instead of draining boards, you have grilled shelves above the sink.

The whole setup just reeks of lazy landlord/developer effort.

Edit:  [Beheading in Islam.](http://www.orthodoxislam.org/beheading-in-islam.html)

&gt;The legal evidence of beheading in Islam is the hadith narrated by Ali ra which states no capital punishment except by the sword. This is hadith is graded acceptable by Sheikh Turkmani in his book Aljawharat AlNaqi. Scholars however disagreed that whether beheading by sword is the only way for capital punishment or not but it is one of the ways. Islam however does not permit slaughter as it is too much a suffering and the minimum amount of suffering in capital punishment is sought. The evidence is the verse ""No extremity in killing should be done (Fala Usrif fil Qatl)""

Also, [here's an article from the quite moderate Slate magazine which deals with the association of Islam and beheading.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/02/decapitation_and_the_muslim_world.html)  One piece of trivia:

Countries that rank well on efficiency but not effectiveness should worry that investment in their education systems and sound management of resources is still not catapulting them into the super-league of global performers. 

&gt;The conclusion should not merely be a race to maximise efficiency—Britain could raise its ranking here simply by cutting teacher wages by around 10%, but that is hardly likely. **Instead, it needs to work out more rigorously what teachers should be doing differently, apply the best practice more consistently and allow poorly performing schools to be taken over by better ones.** The statistical deluge is enlightening. But the factor most likely to make a difference to outcomes is what happens at the chalk face.

In my view there should be mandatory space standards on new builds, in addition to improved quality requirements - the housing deficit allows crap quality to sell at top price because of buyer desperation.

Speaking generally:

I think in many cases people see housing as a pure investment, which it isn't. You can't simply look at it as a ""minimise cost, maximise profit"" endeavour, because there are real people living there and it is often their *home* for long periods: they deserve a good standard of life (much of which comes from housing); to be comfortable and secure; to get very good service for their rental payments. 

For example, we've all been stuck in situations where landlords and agents promise a lot and deliver nothing: completely uninterested in upgrades or repairs that improve the lives of their occupants, because they don't feel the discomfort of it being too cold or humid; paying excessively high heating costs, or refusing to replace temperamental appliances because it's an expense they see no financial benefit from; skimping on sound insulation, as they aren't kept up at night... 

Being a landlord comes with **a lot** of responsibility if you are going to do it properly.

true,LORD_CAKE_FARTS,num19,,"I honestly don't think the revenue increase will be enough to make too much of a sizable difference. 

Other than the fact that a state-of-the-art arena will be good for marketing Spurs as ""the next world-class club,"" I think some people are overlooking the cost of operating and maintaining a larger arena. That's one thing that the extra revenue will go towards.

Another thing is that the arena is expensive, so even when Spurs start their new marketing campaign, the revenue spike will be used for debt payments, meaning that it will be a while before the club will have the resources to back up their campaign. If the debt takes too long to erase, the lack of resources during that time will eventually lead to accusations of  ""empty promises"" from fans, leading to loss of interest from potential new consumers and therefore failing to gain world-class status. Consequently,  by the time the impact of the new arena comes full force, it will take even longer to convince world-class players to come to Spurs, even if Spurs have the money. Look at Monaco: all the money in the world, not enough respect to get all the world-class players they could buy. Even the ones they were able to get, they were not able to retain. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is: the greater amount of seats will not be the main factor in the economic impact of the new arena, but the way that Spurs can use the new arena as proof of them being a world-class club, thus giving them the recognition needed to lure top tier players to the club. However, if the debt from the arena takes too long to clear and Spurs don't have the revenue to buy the players needed to push them to the top, fans and business will lose interest, thus losing the initial advantage they had with the new arena.",0,1410001650,null,0,false,0,ckaogh3,t3_2fm55p,t1_ckaogh3,t3_2fm55p,null,1427170086,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

It's in the landlord's interest to provide a decent level of accommodation. Not only because you'll be able to achieve higher rental incomes, but because you're also far more likely to attract high quality long term tenants.

Long term tenants are more desirable as they require far less micro-management and are more likely to take care of the property they're living in, especially if the housing if of a high-standard to begin with.

The ingredients containing Diacetyl are broadly avoided by all good juice manufacturers and are already are routinely tested for by members of ECITA. (http://www.ecita.org.uk/blog/index.php/diacetyl-found-in-vip-butterscotch-eliquid/) I do however agree that all juice manufacturers should be legally required to have batch tests done, either independently or part of a trade group like ECITA.

Diacetyl on average is found in much higher doses in cigarettes compared to ecigs and the disease that Diacetyl is known to causes isn't actually found in cigarette smokers, suggesting the much higher dosage found even in cigarettes is too low to actually cause the disease.

""Daily diacetyl exposure from cigarettes 5870ug, compared with only 56ug from ecigs"" (Based on averages. Some juices have a higher Diacetyl content, but still much less than cigarettes).

I've spoken to a lot of fans who resent Tottenham being treated more as a business than a club, however necessary it might be. People who feel it's too much about making a profit, who feel their love of the club is being exploited at the expense of their wallets, who feel their opinions don't matter but because Levy and the other higher-ups just look at the season ticket waiting list and laugh.

Recently a friend of mine had his wallet stolen along with his season ticket. The club charged him £10 to print a new one. The line to collect the new one at the ticket office was massive, not helped by the fact there were about 3x as many StubHub dedicated collection booths as official Tottenham ones. 

Neither of those things are particularly abhorrent, but just little things that people can and do notice that push the 'business' side of the club maybe a little too hard and make people feel like the club is just lining it's coffers; selling off our players and not using the money to finance big name buys. (These are usually the same fans who forget the fortune we spent last year on reputable players that didn't work out as well as we hoped it would.)

I guess what I'm trying to say is some fans are fickle and don't realise, or don't want to realise, this money making process is necessary. But it's not helped by the club's characteristic silence over big matters, and Levy's annual letters that always say the same thing. We're obviously not going to get an article as open and blunt as the OP from the club, but maybe a bit more openness would help allay some concerns from fans whom pump into it the most money.

Ultimately, you can turn down some tenants and wait for better to come along, however if you're in need of somewhere to live you generally don't have the luxury of waiting long.

If there were a surfeit of good rental and purchase options available it would be great - but as there aren't, many landlords are free to take an approach of: ""take it or leave it, after all there are plenty of people who will pay for shit because there's no choice"". That's a factor of scarcity within the market that needs remedying.

I really think having such limited choices available is not in consumers interests. Ultimately, it shouldn't be about the landlord preferring to attract better clients and the consumer having to scrape about finding decent places - it should be about the consumer having a very wide range of good and affordable options where so they aren't ever forced into having to settle for a shitty place.

**SPENDING** (per capita):

* **Scotland** £11,370
* **UK** £10,320

**RAISED** (per capita):

* **Scotland** £8,221 (or £9,241 with 90% of Oil)
* **UK** 'under £8,320'* (or +£103 for 10% of oil if you want?)

**DEFICIT** (per capita):

* **Scotland** £3,150 (with 90% of oil £2,130)
* **UK** 'average person was well over £2,000 last year'*

*It didn't list the figure just said 'If you apply the same kind calculation to the UK as a whole, the net 'subsidy' for the average person was well over £2,000 last year' but if that whole figure includes Scotland's deficit before oil is added then it could be raising the average a little?

So conclusions:

* If you include Oil we all have about the same tax deficit in total £s.
* If you don't include Oil, Scotland gets a bit of a subsidy (which might be fair enough given the generally more rural population).
* Scotland raises about the average figure of tax before oil.",0,1410007494,null,0,1410007727,0,ckapjfv,t3_2fmnxq,t1_ckapjfv,t1_ckaoo7l,null,1427169517,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24
