So much redistribution upwards is already built into our economy (and plenty still happens through government with massive corporate welfare, bailouts, State-enforced monopolies, faux privatisations etc.) that when people have democratic control of a responsive government they tend to want to use it to level the playing field a bit with some redistribution in their direction for a change.

As for regulations, again, you're missing the larger context in which capitalist businesses operate as cost externalising machines, and without democratic regulation, will generate private profits by ruthlessly externalising all their costs socially - onto the environment (global warming, resource depletion), onto their workers (in terms of risking their health and welfare), onto their local community and the wider society (pollution, outsourcing/relocating work to developng countries, etc.).

My local area has been destroyed by Roma gypsies. They shit in the street, they have broken into 6/7 houses since they arrived in January. They assault people, they spit at people, they've even flung a bottle of piss at one of my neighbors. 

They have no respect for our culture, they laugh at us.. they care only about themselves and have no concept of a civil society, sanitation, or mutual respect.

I'm tired of being told I'm a ""racist"" or ""xenophobe"" by people that live in affluent middle class suburbs and don't see how the Roma actually act. Everyone I've spoken to who has ever lived around the Roma knows just how bad they are. It's not racism, it's just their culture.

They're not fit to live in a civilized society.  They all mooch off benefits and refuse to work. When they first moved here one of my left wing neighbors gave one of them a job cleaning his house and within 4 hours the bloke had nicked his laptop and iPad and sold them at a pawn shop. He's voting UKIP now, too. 

I've spoken to the local police and they can't do anything. I've put up a CCTV camera as have most people on the street, but the fucks wear disguises and so its impossible to prove its them. We all know it is though.

The neighborhood was quite nice before January - working class, but low levels of crime. Now it's an absolute shit hole. I'm considering moving but I don't really have the money to. I'm stuck in a shit hole and its getting worse every day, as it seems like every other week another batch of them arrive.

I'm tired of being told by Guardianista that ""they need our help!"". They can't be helped. You give them a job? They'll steal everything in sight. You give them money once? They'll harass you forever more and then attack you if you don't give them more money. You tell them to fuck off? They'll put shit through your letter box and smear it on your door.

I'm tired of all this bollocks. UKIP are the only party that would deport foreign criminals. Labour, tories, and the lib dems are happy to let more and more of these people into the country and to let them stay here even if they commit crimes.

The article reeks a bit of ""I was used to being a big fish in a small pond, but *everyone* here is smart and I'm not special any more"". He complains that he's not getting his money's worth, when he's getting more contact time than most students in this country who are all paying the same amount, *and* he's getting contact time with professors who are likely leading academics in their field. Cambridge isn't about spoon-feeding you material in lectures, it's about putting you in a position to engage with world-class experts. And yes, you have to self-motivate and do independent study too. *All* universities require that. 

&gt; I’ve not been prepared for my future; I don’t have a clue what I’m going to be doing with my life.

Neither do most other students in this country. *If* this is a failing of the university, then it is a failing of all universities here, not just Cambridge. 


He's right about one thing - Cambridge doesn't have much in the way of nightclubs. It's got some great pubs, and the colleges all have their own bars, but the clubbing is limited. It strikes me that this shouldn't be a deciding factor in whether a university is any good, but I guess it might be important to some people.

But putting all that aside, and assuming for the sake of argument that all of his complaints are totally fair, true and not things that he can change; 

This is one guy, and *every* university has a bunch of people like this guy who regret their decision to go there. Cambridge is no exception. But I don't know anyone in Cambridge who doesn't love it (except for the occasional person who didn't enjoy their course - problem solved as soon as they transfer to a different one).

I think the biggest question you should ask yourself is how keen you are on your subject. Cambridge is for academic people who love what they do - if you are keen on the idea of meeting and working with people who are as enthusiastic about your subject as you, then Cambridge is perfect. 

I also think the extra-curricular life is pretty great - despite what this guy seems to say, there's so much more than rowing and drinking societies. Pretty much any kind of activity you can think of - sporty, arty, musical, dancey, sciencey, the list goes on - you can do in Cambridge.

true,[deleted],null,null,"They are only being asked to wait 3 months before claiming.  Doesn't it seem strange that people can afford to go travelling for 6 months to a year but can't afford 3 months without JSA?  Was it sensible for them to give up their jobs and go travelling and the come back and expect a benefits cheque?  Is it fair to rest of us who paid in for that 6 months?  Benefits are meant to be there as the last resort, not the appropriate source of fund for someone returning from a 6 month holiday.

I would prefer a much more generous system but that isn't what we have and it does seem to me that most of the people listed had at least some hand in their own positions, that they could be accused of taking advantage:  Why hadn't they made any effort to find work in the UK before they returned?  Did they seek leaves of absence rather than just quitting before they went?

Take Emma for example:

&gt;Emma Birks, 36, was a volunteer co-ordinator at a worker's co-operative in Birmingham before deciding to go travelling in south-east Asia. ""I'd been putting it off and putting it off,"" she explained, ""and then sometimes you think 'life's too short'.""

&gt;Since she got back in March, Birks has had no home and has been living between the houses of ""three or four"" charitable friends. She has been surviving by taking handouts and using credit cards. Because of her work, she knew about the habitual residence test and never dreamed she would fail it.

So her plan was to quit her job and go travelling and then turn up back at heathrow homeless, jobless and penniless and expect to be housed and fed!?  She's 36 and acting like an immature 18 year old.  That's not a plan, it's taking advantage of a system that's meant to help people who are the victim of circumstance not a victim of their own total lack of responsibility.

I know it's harsh but I have paid almost 4k in NI in the last 6 months, why should I give that to Emma to cover her holiday plans when I can't afford a house?

a) You can make the crops have a higher food density (ie. more food per plant), so to get the same yield, you would use less area (also less failed plants) 

b) less use of insecticides/herbicides which can get into the local environment and kill of other plants, 

c) You can make the GM crops unable to breed - meaning no cross pollination with local plants.

Point c) can cause contention with 'damage to agriculture' though, as it forces farmers to buy up new crops every year (some disreputable companies actually do this deliberately to stop farmers re-using seeds). But, I suspect this is a new industry issue, it can be regulated against/the farming economy will adjust if GM becomes readily available.

The point is, good GM will allow for much higher crop yields (feeding more people) and much better for the environment in the long run (non-withstanding digging up more land to make crops, but traditional farming has that issue too).",0,1400754984,null,0,false,0,choabk7,t3_266wkd,t1_choabk7,t1_choa30x,null,1433905777,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

Once again you're **completely** misunderstanding me.

I'm saying that while yes, that policy sucks, *you have the capacity to change it* (if you become a member of the Green party).

It's a bit of a vicious cycle to discard them outright because of one policy you don't agree with. If the people who don't like that policy don't join in, that policy doesn't have a chance of changing. So the people who don't like it don't join in, so the policy remains the same, and so on ad infinitum.

that is the problem IMHO:  You should never be accustomed to a safety net.

People should not ever need them.  Saying ""but I thought there would be a safety net"" is not a good reason for you to have jumped from a building.

I don't think these people have ""fallen"", I think they have thrown themselves.  Should there be a safety net?  Yes of course.  Should someone who threw themselves down be able to complain if they slip through that net?  No.

At least that is how I see it.  It seems like all the people in the article were well informed about the system and expected to be able to claim and now find they can't for 3 months.  

That is less than £1000 in total (presuming that is all they expected to claim).  If they could afford to take 6-12 months off, travel and volunteer, why don't they have even £1000 in contingency or savings?

I've always enjoyed plinking beer cans in the garden with an air rifle, and I'm getting more into the competitive side of the sport now at a local smallbore rifle club. Looking forward to getting a shotgun too and having a crack at some clays.

As you said you're 'not calling for legality', it's worth pointing out that guns are not illegal in the UK, any more than alcohol or tobacco are. They're controlled, in the sense that there are restrictions on who can buy one, what they can buy, and where they can use it. That's as it should be.

There are about 25,000 firearms certificate holders in the country, which means a person who is registered with the police as a gun owner, who has passed background and reference checks, and who has been visited and interviewed by a police firearms specialist to make sure that they're a suitable person to have a gun, that they have somewhere to legally shoot it, and that they have secure storage for it. The police have a record of every gun held in this way, and regularly check them along with the amount of ammunition you're licensed to have.

There are many more people (maybe ten or twenty times that number) who just enjoy shooting at a local club or range, without particularly wanting to keep a gun at home. They don't need a certificate. Just turn up to your local shooting club and they will probably let you have a go with a rifle to see if you like it (you'll have to go at least twice before you're allowed to actually shoot).

When I got into shooting I was quite surprised at how little people in general know about the sport. Many people think guns are banned entirely in the UK, and others have no idea that there's any reason to use guns other than to commit violent crimes. Some are emotionally upset by the idea of guns and shooting.

With that in mind, I think the more we talk about it and point out in a conversational way that shooting is a fun sport enjoyed by normal people, the more comfortable the public at large will be with it. Fear comes from unfamiliarity.

From an economic stand point the UK has yet to recover from the credit crisis, and leaving the EU is not a clever economic decision. Several companies have already made clear that they will close their UK centers if the UK leaves the EU which would result in a large loss of jobs in a time where unemployment is already high. In addition to this our membership of the EU grants us inter-European exports and imports based on EU regulations - it's hard to say what would happen if we left, if we and the countries we trade with decide to maintain the current regulations then nothing much would change, however if we decide to impose higher tariffs on EU imports, or vice-versa it could negatively affect the economy.  The main point being it would result in an unnecessary uncertainty we don't need, especially with our current economic condition.

The other issue is with the travel and work restriction it would impose on Britons, sure we could stop EU immigrants from coming here, but it would also make it harder for us to travel, study or work aboard, which for me is a huge loss. At the moment I'm not restricted to the opportunities available in the UK, if a study or work opportunity comes up in the EU I can take it. Not to mention the fact if I feel like going to France or Amsterdam, or anywhere else in the EU, I can just hop on a plane or ferry and be off, without any visas or arduous procedures, I don't want to lose that either.

Not to mention we would no longer be liable to EU human rights regulations, from UKIP's website:
&gt; Remove the UK from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights

Since bitcoin transfers take under 10 minutes, I think the fair comparison would be the $86 or $95 fee option. The cheapest ($5) option requires sending from a bank account to a bank account and waiting 6 days for settlement/clearing. On top of all that, the effective FX rate used by WU is approximately 4.7%. So, even if you were to use the $5 bank-to-bank option, the total cost would be over $50 by the time the money was available to the recipient 6 days later.

Err how?

They still have to be paid, the difference is with no fees they are paid via general taxation.

If you've got 50% of the population going to university, that puts those who don't get a university education at a disadvantage (compared to say 40 years ago when it was about 5% who went).

So you are saying that those who were the unlucky 50% should pay for those who had all the benefit?

What we have now is kind of like a graduate tax.  Those who went to uni, pay for it if they start earning above a certain threshold.

The assertion that having such a high proportion of people go to university, whilst in many ways laudable, doesn't have an example showing that it benefits the economy.  In fact, working in software, I am well aware of the shortage of developers, the high cost of a good one is limiting our growth as a company.

true,creamyjoshy,eng-Surrey,Straight Outta Surrey,"Democracy can't function to it's fullest if there are fewer choices. I predict this will end with labour and conservatives being the only real powers in parliament. The people vote for them because of their lack of choice, not because they *want* any of them in power. 

I mean, with the EU elections, have any of the parties shown off what they're capable of? Or are they just shit smearing each other? Do any of these phrases ring any bells?: ""UKIP are racist"", ""Liberals are spineless"", ""Labour are incompetent"", ""Greens are idealists"", ""Conservatives are elitists"".

When is the last time you heard anybody saying ""I'm voting for this party because I **trust** them""?

With more parties, the parties are forces to actually compete for voters. They'll actually have to start getting good.

When there is more choice for people, democracy prospers. People choose to vote labour or conservative because nobody else chooses to vote for any other options. It's a vicious cycle. 

EDIT: I respect people's right to vote how they please, and I'm not advocating they vote for or against the liberals. You're right in that we'll still be a democracy, of course. But democracy isn't a binary 0/1 option. It's more like a spectrum, if voters have more choice, and so vote based on ideals that they find personally important, then you have a healthy democracy. If you have the option of two parties, well they don't really have to try very hard to appease voters. I'm just pointing out that the average voter will not take this long term scenario into account, which will very much influence how they vote.

true,portaccio,stmirren,,"I suppose I'm naturally pessimistic, but I think that performances at youth level rarely transform in to senior football. I've mentioned this before, but if you look at [the team that played in the u19 Euro final in 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_U-19_Championship_2006#Final) there aren't many that went on to play at a high level. Some of them aren't even pros now. So while some folk will look at Islam Feruz and say he's enormously promising, I can't help seeing that he'll be 19 in a few months and has never made a senior appearance.

On the positive side, I think Scottish clubs are in a good position now to develop young players. No-one can afford to bring in lots of quality players, so giving youth players senior appearances is a must. This season we frequently had five players from our youth system in the starting eleven. I have very high hopes for John McGinn. I think he slipped under the radar a wee bit this year due to all the good youngsters at Dundee Utd, as well as Stevie May. McGinn is still only 19 and must be one of the first names of the team sheet. He swept up at the Saints player of the year awards, and deservedly so. 

[See this nice assist against Dundee Utd (even if he does get a wee bit lucky with the final ball).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpXdrdBqZLc)

[Also against Dundee Utd, McGinn shows some excellent composure to finish this one off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzHmGOUGrY) 

You can never tell whether someone will make it at the top level, but McGinn is the best youth player I've ever seen us produce. The two players I've seen us sell on, Stephen McGinn and Simon Lappin, have knocked around the English Championship and League One, but I think John McGinn could do better than that. I'm confident he could do a job for a Championship team as he is now.

At 22, Kenny McLean is getting towards the stage where he can no longer be thought of as a youngster, but he is still one with a lot of potential. He can be a bit inconsistent; hitting a perfect 80 yard cross-field ball one minute, then misplacing a five yard pass the next. But he can really strike a ball. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0bKn_WDp6M) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iwzfqyt2hk). Sometimes he's played just off the striker, but he's also been tried as more of a deep lying playmaker. Personally I prefer him in the more attacking role. He certainly adds some class to midfield. Sadly, he has almost certainly played his last game for St Mirren.

As for other clubs, I think we all know about the promise at Dundee Utd. Gauld seemed to have a bit of burnout this season, but that's probably natural for someone his age. When I saw Hearts on the last day of the season I was impressed by Callum Paterson, playing in his natural right back position rather than as a striker. I don't think he put a foot wrong and he was confident in possession. Another one I've been impressed with is Stuart Bannigan at Partick Thistle. Like McLean, we may have to stop thinking of him as a youngster soon. Still, he's only 21 and is a precise passer of the ball and always seems to be available to receive the ball from his defence.

2) The usual things when buying a vehicle. There are plenty around so make sure you get one with a full service history. 

3) It is an annual inspection. **IT DOES NOT CHECK EVERYTHING AND IS ONLY AN INDICATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE VEHICLE ON THE DAY OF THE TEST**. Too many people think the fact a car has a valid MOT even a couple of months old means the car is in good condition. A MOT only checks for safety and emissions so it doesn't check for a worn clutch or if the cambelt is OK for example. A used car will come with a valid MOT.

It would be fine if the Brussels level of government restricted itself to issues of inter country importance but ever increasingly they have been deciding things on a much smaller level interfering with the national sovereignty of the member states.  

That isn't to say that all the legislation drafted through Brussels is bad, but for member states, and even more so the UK (with our common law system to name just one importance difference) a one size fits all policy frequently does more harm than good.

She's paid NI, but less than, for example, my Dad. Her pension, when she can claim it, will be something like £12 a week, compared to the full state pension of £140 or whatever a week my Dad will get on top of his company pension.

true,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,"&gt; He [Mr Richards] said that blocking of any kind by internet access providers was “highly undesirable” but that companies should be allowed to apply traffic management to optimise the consumer experience.
&gt; He said: “This should not extend to outright blocking, throttling or practices such as the anti-competitive prioritisation of a network’s own content and services. However, it is important that framework of regulation should be fully capable of addressing areas of serious concern such as child safety.”

The old ""not the children"" excuse.

&gt;Mr Richards also supported the provision of managed services by network operators to help them make “a return for investment they have made in their networks” – adding that this should ultimately be beneficial for consumer.
His words are likely to be welcomed by companies in the telecoms industry, which want to develop specialised services and charge different prices.

These semantics sound just like he wants the the opposite of Net Neutrality to me.

Thanks for your clarification. We've read FCA handbook several times and found it rather useful. As far as I'm concerned, the ""deposit"" account we have is out of the scope of FCA regulations, because the purpose for which the account is designed does not involve payments or money remittance. The only usage of the account is to buy bitcoins from us, as we are the counterparty in every single trade at Cryptopay. As long as FCA doesn't treat Bitcoin as a currency, our business doesn't have anything to do with regulations.

Imagine you are buying some electronics for your business and pay upfront via bank transfer. Do you think it has something to do with AML or Payment Service Directive in this case? I don't think so.

I'm quite aware of how other UK retailers work, but I do think that paying into someone's personal account involves more risks that working with us.

Slightly modified comment from that thread:

Assuming Lampard has a season left in him, Terry one, Cech two or less depending on the Courtios situation, I'd say David Luiz (assuming he isn't sold) as Captain and Gary Cahill as Vice-Captain, based on our current line-up.

I think Luiz is a big personality and someone who never says die when it comes to big matches. He still has some way to go in being disciplined, but I think as a player who already vice-captains his country it's a no brainier for us.

Gary Cahill suits Vice-Captain well, since he doesn't seem imposing enough to command the team, but is responsible enough to help lead it. I think he'd make a good partner with Luiz.

Ivanovich would be another good shout, as he captain's his country too, but given his age I can see him declining in the near future like Cole and our captain has to play practically every game.

The other players in our squad are either too young or wont be here (Torres, Ba, Eto'o) when JT and Lamps leave. I'd like to see what happens to Hazard as I think he might have a captain's quality about him, but I think it all depends on how he develops both as a player and a man.

Overall, you've got to remember that our future Captain and Vice-Captain have to be commanding, fearless, disciplined and unrelenting.

Precisely what practice are you referring to? When ever this is raised it tends to be out-dated or simply flat-out wrong stories.

Just to clear a few before you start typing; everyone buys new seeds every year.  Cross-contaminating suing farmers never happened in the real world. The ""Indian farmer suicides"" thing  was a myth. Re-using seeds in violation of the usage license *is* punished, with all proceeds from Monsanto doing it going to charity. Monocultures are independent of GMOs existing. Old varieties of plants are not being replaced and anyone can grow any variety at any time by visiting a seed bank.

No they don't have to be prosecuted before they can be described as evading justice. If they committed a crime such as torture, which it's beyond dispute the US did, then the lack of a prosecution is reflective of many things but not the absence of illegal activity.

Would the Greens have just stood there while genocide happened in Yugoslavia?

Would the Falkland Islanders have been left to the Argentine Junta to avoid a conflict?

I dislike even more the idea of those people paying for the splendor of others.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who had an awesome fun time at uni, did pretty much no work for their first year, and only regret not doing more fun activities.

&gt;My point was that I think it's dishonest of the lib dems to claim trebling fees was the only valid option in the current economic climate. Especially since it hardly saves any money in the short term.

Problem is, I agree with doing it.  I'm all about sustainability.  I don't like borrowing money for anything which isn't a sure fire return.  When I was a student, I spent a lot of time working for the Aim Higher and similar programs promoting science and engineering, running projects in schools which had few people go on to higher education and such.  I really value it.  That said, I think a lot of people back when I got my degree a decade ago, we reading useless bullshit.  The had courses with little educational merrit, bums on seats, charging the same.  I had the vice dean explain that getting support for shifting lectures to the 200+ people kind was vital if we were going to make the school I was in, 'economically viable compared with the humanities'.

Many Unis have been gearing up for running large scale sausage factory schooling of cheap subjects which yield little to no economic improvement.  This is a very bad situation.

Making a student think ""hmm will this be worth the £30k of extra tax I'll have to start paying back in 3+ years time"" is a great way of trying to do that.

If a degree is completely free, then they don't have to make a difficult choice, it's value has to be better than nothing right?

What we really need to do, is try and provide people with guidance and advice on letting them find something which is both in demand, and suited to them.

I think it's very responsible to make clear the costs up front.  It's the opposite of our policy on say pensions, so I really like it.

We're talking about a 0.3% increase in a year, which is high but hardly unprecedented. If we take an average large town in your county to be 40,000 then 120 people will have moved there.

I like to be reasonably sure of what I'm quoting :-)

&gt;they don't have to be prosecuted before they can be described as evading justice.

No, they have to be prosecuta*ble*. Legitimately, too - most of the lawyers I've seen making statements along the lines of war-crimes only did so once the act was irrelevant; they weren't saying that when it mattered.

&gt;If they committed a crime such as torture, which it's beyond dispute the US did, then the lack of a prosecution is reflective of many things but not the absence of illegal activity.

Correct - but there are many subsections of whats acceptable that really come down to individual countries. Is it immoral for our guys to leave the room while someone from the country that asserts it's OK to do the torturing? No, but then it gets messy as we delve into what different countries find acceptable, and that's where the problem really starts. I, for example, think that Uganda is criminal for persecuting gays, and that many middle-eastern countries are criminal for the way in which they repress women; but that doesn't mean I can start describing their rulers as evading prosecution.

&gt;I mean there are obvious questions about enforceability and the difficulty of bringing war criminals to justice. You could say (I think you are saying) that absent enforceability international law basically has no teeth on this

It's more a case of asserting that if we wanted to charge Blair/ Bush with crimes, it has to go through the U.N. - we can't base part of the charge on their bypassing the UN in order to invade (even if the process was stalled) and then bypass the UN for the likes of Kuala Lumpur because they won't proceed with prosecutions - at the very least, doing the latter weakens the charges.

&gt;but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it's breaches aren't completely obvious in this case.

I think we've broadened the scope a bit - I've really been discussing the legality of the invasion; torture methods and the like are an ongoing subject, not really limited to individuals like Blair and (to my mind) much muddier than invading someone that's poked fun at the UN for ten years *after surrendering*.",0,1400764931,null,0,1400765238,0,chocquo,t3_266hxz,t1_chocquo,t1_choc09z,null,1433906918,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I actually think its entirely disingenuous not to present it in that manner and saying ""its OK its only a few people here and there."" It may be but we still need to provide additional housing and services equivalent to several towns worth every year which needs to be paid for and no matter how much tax they pay its not going to be sufficient to fund several towns worth of public services. 

&gt;  If we take an average large town in your county to be 40,000 then 120 people will have moved there. 

Except that's not what happens is it? They tend to migrate to specific areas. Towns like Boston saw a massive rise in its population because lots of Eastern Europeans migrated there for work. Boston increased by 15% in a decade, the equivalent to the population of your city, London, increasing by 1.3 million people. How well do you think that would work out in London?

An increase of 212,000 might not sound a lot to someone like you who lives in a city of 8.3 million people but to people living in towns like mine where its almost twenty times the population of that town it is a lot.

Only it does. I can add a bank account and request withdrawals from you in FIAT without ever having to buy a single Bitcoin. 

&gt; Imagine you are buying some electronics for your business and pay upfront via bank transfer.

This analogy is redundant. You are satisfying a legal obligation on a contract you've entered into with the seller to buy goods at an agreed price. How you pay is irrelevant.

Your service does not SELL. I deposit and later I may *choose* to BUY. 

&gt; I'm quite aware of how other UK retailers work, but I do think 

You keep saying ""you think"". I'm going to be blunt; it doesn't matter what you think, it matters what the law says. Hire a solicitor and let someone legally qualified tell you what the law *says* you can do, not what *you think* you can do.

&gt;*In particular we note that the number of new NINOs issued to Romania and Bulgarian citizens in the first quarter of this year was 45,000, of whom around 10,000 arrived in that quarter. This suggests that our estimate of a 50,000 a year increase in the UK population of these citizens will be broadly correct.*

&gt;*It is also very significant that the number of non-EU students recorded as departing in the IPS last year was only 50,000, compared to an average inflow over the last five years of 155,000. This suggests that students staying on legally or otherwise comprise a major part of net migration.

Mod 2 isn't like Mod 1, there's no special manoeuvres you need to demonstrate, it's just a normal ride. If you're riding like that on the road you're putting yourself - and, albeit to a lesser extent, others - in danger.

I'm hoping the only reason you are having difficulty is because you're one of those people who suffer from nerves when they're put on the spot. I can't sympathise personally as I'm lucky enough to be at my calmest under test conditions, but my mum occasionally tells the story of how, when she took her driving test, she was shaking so much the examiner made her get out and walk around the car until she had calmed down a bit.

If it's not nerves and you're just a poor rider, I would agree with what others have said here and suggest you invest in some instruction. Failing that, look up the DSA standards on the internet and start practising riding as if you're on your test. When I booked my mod 2 I spent the 3 months\* leading up to it narrating my rides to myself. For example: ""ok I'm approaching a junction and I'll be turning right. Check my mirrors and signal. Quick head check and adjust my road position. Decelerate. Look both ways, quick mirror check, lifesaver and turn. Cancel signal, mirrors, accelerate."" I picked up a few minors but got through it on my first go, which made me happy since I needed 2 tries at my CBT, 2 at my theory and 3 at my mod 1. Riding didn't come naturally to me.

\* There was a long backlog that year. Ended up taking the test on my birthday, which coincidentally was the same day that the DSA went on strike in support of the nurses strike. The girl who was supposed to be taking her driving test in front of me got sent home. I was expecting the same treatment but it turned out they had only cancelled cage tests - bike testing was going ahead.

Why should they stop to let you past? Why should they break the law and go onto a pavement for your benefit? Why shouldn't they ride 1/3rd into the road as the highway code suggests (this prevents people from overtaking when they shouldn't)?

Also, If you're having 4 serious hazards a week involving different cyclists, it's more than likely you who is at fault.

My point is, they are all people. Different people with different reasons to be there. We need to all share the roads and look out for each other, even if that means your journey is slightly slower than it would be otherwise. 

(By the way, I'm not a cyclist anymore.)",0,1400768017,null,0,false,0,chodxil,t3_265c8c,t1_chodxil,t1_choai19,null,1433907477,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,RecklessFandango,,Bangor,"The problem with electronic voting, security aside, is privacy - your vote is meant to be private - you go to the polls and you prove to the staff there you're eligible to vote, then you take your polling card and vote for whoever. The card does not identify you, just who you vote for - the whole point being that you can't get a polling card without valid ID, so at best, all someone could find out is that you voted, not who you voted for.

To vote on a mobile, for instance, you would need to be able to both prove who you are AND vote anonymously. On the same device - this cannot be done, or at least not easily and in a foolproof fashion. You would have to electronically pass credentials in order to present a valid vote, which would tie your details to the device casting the vote, meaning that someone digging through metadata could, theoretically figure out who voted for whom.

Say some less than savoury types get their hands on a ballot box, the best they could do is see how many votes were cast for each candidate. Not that useful. But if they had a load of metadata with names attached to each digital ballot, they could go out and threaten to kneecap the people who voted for whoever they don't like - most people like intact knees. I certainly like mine.

TL;DR: privacy concerns - the polling stations need to both know who you are and they also need to not know who you voted for.",0,1400768061,null,0,false,0,chody61,t3_267cnv,t1_chody61,t3_267cnv,null,1433907486,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

Look at how different athletes who've suffered the injury have dealt with it. Basketball is a great example, since this problem is most prevalent in that sport. Players like Dwayne Wade and Chris Paul had it cut out and quickly taken care of, and while they were back on the floor in a matter of weeks, they're both plagued by knee issues that have increasingly affected their performances as they get older. Someone like Derrick Rose, on the other hand, chose to have it repaired and fully rehabilitated -- and he missed the last 6 months of the season.

People reference the Torres injury; they forget that he originally had meniscus repair in January 2010, was out for 4-6 weeks, returned, was in blistering form, and then aggravated the same problem in April against Benfica in the Europa League (a game in which he scored two goals and played 80 minutes after getting hurt in the early stages of the match. I'll never forget that performance). EDIT: Torres then rushed himself back *again* for the World Cup. He was never -- and I can't stress this enough, because this was definitively the turning point in his career when you look back on everything -- ever the same player after that second surgery.

The bottom line is that I'm in shock, and genuinely worried. Luis has been indestructible for the majority of his career, and this is an injury that you cannot rush or try to brush off -- especially when you're dealing with an athlete who'll do anything to get back on the pitch.

This can raise your credit card spending at no cost to yourself (since by paying them off in full you never pay any interest) and hopefully maybe even pay back a little in rewards.

By only planning on spending smaller amounts cashback type cards might be worth looking into:

1. If you have a Santander 123 Current Account there is no fee for the Santander 123 Cashback card, otherwise the £24/year fee. 3% cashback on travel (up to £300/mth spend), 2% cashback in department stores, 1% in supermarkets and 0% cashback elsewhere. The fee requires about £800 travel spend to cancel out before you start earning actual cashback (unless you have the current account).

2. The Amex Platinum Everyday has no fee but requires £3k spend to get any cashback at all. There is an introductory 5% cashback for up to £2k spend in the first 3 months. After that it is tiered at 0.5% cashback on up to £3.5k. For £3.5-7.5k 1% cashback and for £7.5k and above 1.25% cashback.

3. The Amex Platinum credit card has a £25/year fee. There is an introductory 5% cashback for up to £2.5k spend in the first 3 months and cashback is a flat 1.25% after that with no minimum spend to qualify. With the annual fee you'd need to spend around £1.2k in the first year and £2k in subsequent years to cancel out the fee, more would start to earn you actual cashback.

There are also some non-cash rewards cards:

1. The Tesco credit card rewards 5 points per £4 spent either Tesco stores or on Tesco fuel, elsewhere you only get 1 point per £1 spent. Clubcard points can be redeemed in-store for 1p/point or for 3-4p/point by exchanging them for special Clubcard Rewards. The reward rate works out at anywhere from 0.25% (spend not at Tesco and redeeming in-store) up to 5% (spending in-store and redeeming by Clubcard Rewards) in vouchers.
2. MBNA offer a Visa/Amex card combo. Their site seems a bit opaque for finding out what you can do with their reward points but MSE has it down as a 1% return in vouchers or a 0.8% return in cash for spending on the Amex card. Spend on the Visa card comes back as half that.

Airline reward type credit cards usually require a large annual spend to get the decent rewards. The exact figures vary a lot between cards but unless you are spending at least £5k a year, if not more like £10k a year, they aren't really worth it.",0,1400768384,null,0,false,0,choe2x9,t3_261ezg,t1_choe2x9,t1_chnjijw,null,1433907548,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

true,kris_lace,null,null,"I'm at a loss for words really. It's concerning if cyclists are by law not allowed to go on the pavement full stop and are encouraged to take 1/3rd of the road. On my commute there are large spells of 60mph country roads which can comfortably fit two cars so it's no problem in that sense - yet cyclists regularly go along these roads probably because it's scenic. There is steady traffic going each way so when one cyclist is on one side they will usually be holding up about 10 cars or so who can't overtaken into the other lane because of the oncoming traffic and also the nature of the road not having safe overtaking areas. The cyclists literally face forward giving no regard at all to this mess behind them. They are definitely ""hobby"" cyclists as this road is not really near anything. If they were doing my commute they'd arrive at their destination at mid day likely. Also they have no bags and sometimes there's more than one of them.


The worst hazard I've come against is two cyclists on each side of the road holding up their respective lanes if you turn a corner into that, you have to slam on the brakes. What's annoying about the pavements is a stretch of this road has a deserted pavement along it, and it's dead straight so you can see a great deal ahead and behind. If I was a cyclist and knew it was unlawful I'd still go on that pavement rather than hold up traffic during rush hour. If an officer stopped me I would plead he saw I was exercising sensible judgement rather than sticking it to the man. But that's me, I wouldn't suggest braking the law to anyone else. 


Being as level headed as I am able, I am willing to admit that this situation is primarily a road design issue rather than people enjoying their hobbies. So despite my annoyance at the added conjestion and hazards just for the sakes of peoples hobbies during rush hour.. I am happy to instead channel my annoyance at the road designs. Outright some roads should just be illegal for cyclists, these are also the roads that are illegal for lorries too. The alternative being they dropped the speed limit drastically - but you can imagine mine and others rage at  dropping the speed limit for commuters for peoples hobbies. 


But still in my opinion if I had that hobby, JUST because it was lawful to do so wouldn't mean it's sensible and I would still avoid hazardous routes and certainly would avoid rush hour. And I would certainly, certainly have empathy if I am holding up a queue and not letting them pass.

It's primary role should be as a humanitarian force. I know they already do little bits and pieces but we have the resources and capabilities to do a lot more. Of course a small part of it will have to remain a dedicated fighting force, to stop genocides and other atrocities (I don't think drones are necessarily a bad thing, if we use them properly).

If we are helping dozens of countries through disasters and helping build infastructure, feed people, give medical attention etc. we will be able to have truly strong alliances with them. Our trust doesn't need to based on something as flimsy as nuclear weapons.

I would also argue that having nuclear weapons make us more of a target to countries with nuclear weapons, not less.

Also, even if we have another great depression (which seems like a realistic possibility) no one is going to invade the UK. Not in our lifetime atleast. We are a tiny island surrounded by allies (one of the reasons I support the EU) with very little in the way of natural resources compared too quite a few countries.

What countries could realistically take us on? The US? They aren't going to attack us, we don't have much oil and fortunately have a strong relationship with them. Thanks to our strong relationship with the US, any other country would be insane to attack us. 

We used to lead the world. I see no reason we couldn't do that again. Dismantling our nuclear weapons is a first step. I'm absolutely an idealist. You may think that makes me naive.

It's extremely likely the situation in Syria would have been mirrored in Iraq, likely with far more extreme savagery. There's also the question of how Iran's nuclear program would have influenced a Sadaam led Iraq. There could have been a middle east arms race involving Iran, Iraq and the Saudi's, most likely resulting in the Israeli's having a go at kicking off WW3. Big if's with far greater consequences than the actual outcome in Iraq.

That said the  invasion caused horrendous suffering for the Iraqi people. The Americans were too trigger happy and never took in to account the religious and ethnic divides nor the neighbouring countries fueling the flames of a civil war. Disbanding the Iraqi Army and Police broke the rule of law in the country and put hundreds of thousands of unemployed gunmen on the streets. Taking troops from Afghan stretched the allies too far and resulted in not only lack of control of Iraq but a Taliban resurgence in Afghan. 

The there's the whole issue of disregarding International law, sure it seemed the right thing to do at the time but now it's consequences are being seen with Russia's aggressive impunity in Eastern Europe.

Right... and that's exactly why Trident is so important. We are only a small island. And according to Russian documents from the cold war, and our intelligence services, they would pretty much blanket the entire mainland anyway. (I can't find the link right now, sorry!) But basically it's not like housing the weapons in one particular location makes it a target.

I suppose you could argue that having nuclear weapons at all makes us a target for attack, but so would our large economy, our natural resources, our great strategic position on an island and many other things including our figurehead and symbolic position.

true,Change_you_can_xerox,null,null,"&gt;No, they have to be prosecuta*ble*. Legitimately, too - most of the lawyers I've seen making statements along the lines of war-crimes only did so once the act was irrelevant; they weren't saying that when it mattered.

Are you saying there were no objections to the legality of the invasion or torture at the time they were happening? That's bogus. And even if there was no objection at the time, the question is whether it's legal, and that's irrespective of whether or not individual lawyers object at a point in time.

&gt;Correct - but there are many subsections of whats acceptable that really come down to individual countries. 

Torture and aggressive wars don't. Look up the definition of a peremptory norm in international law.

&gt;It's more a case of asserting that if we wanted to charge Blair/ Bush with crimes, it has to go through the U.N. - we can't base part of the charge on their bypassing the UN in order to invade (even if the process was stalled) and then bypass the UN for the likes of Kuala Lumpur because they won't proceed with prosecutions - at the very least, doing the latter weakens the charges.

With all due respect this is legally speaking total gibberish. The UN isn't a prosecuting body. The ICC is, and since torture and aggression are also peremptory norms they also fall under universal jurisdiction and thus national courts can also prosecute.

Ideally what I'd like is if we researched a less cruel way to test research that give reliable/robust evidence for correlation (or better causation, at least as robust as mice currently are) and then test those parts on volunteering humans. That's a long-term plan though, that none of the parties offer.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"I kind of know what you mean and with further explanation, it's not quite as bad as the usual, over generalised, cyclist bashing that (you must admit) your previous comment seemed to be.

I agree with you to the extent that, if indeed these people are just out for a nice ride and nothing more, they ought to avoid rush hour. although I still wouldn't rule out that they are just going to work (all roads are near something and you probably don't know all the businesses in the area; also you don't need to have a bag, they may store their clothes at work).

I also agree that the road designs are shit. I don't think it makes sense to ban cyclists from certain roads though, certainly not in the absence of reasonable alternatives. It seems unfair to force the people who have to power their vehicle using their legs to go the long way round. For the same reason simply ""avoiding hazardous routes"" is not always an option. I'm not sure that dropping the speed limit is the answer either, although mainly because it wouldn't make much difference as it wouldn't actually stop driver from going above it. Although I would add, the ""because drivers would be annoyed"" argument is exactly the reason we have a shit cycling infrastructure in the first place. The answer is for everyone to be aware that there might be cyclists and to drive with due care and attention. If you are going around a blind corner, don't go around it so fast that it would be a problem to have to stop suddenly. It might not be a cyclist, it might be a broken down car, or a sheep, or a tractor, or a fallen tree or anything really. 

If you are behind a cyclist and you can't safely overtake, then don't. Just wait until you can. As a former cyclist (it's not really feasible for me anymore since I changed jobs), believe me it really does feel awful to have a queue of traffic behind you, but you do just have to keep going. Stopping and starting all the time become dangerous in itself (its not a good idea to keep making unexpected manoeuvres) and, if you are commuting, you'd end up adding a lot of time to your own journey just for the sake of not adding a few minutes to someone else's. Not just that but turning your head to look behind can send all but the most accomplished of cyclists off balance and if some impatient berk has chosen that moment to overtake too close, you could find yourself swerving right under his wheels. So, yeah, they know you're there and they are doing their best to minimise the inconvenience, make sure you give them plenty of space and patience and it'll be safer for everyone. 

But, as you say, those that don't need to be there should avoid it altogether at peak times. I don't, however, believe that you could ever know for sure, so I would advocate the benefit of the doubt in all cases.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I don't agree with the EDL but the UAF are a rentamob bunch as well, why not condemn them both?

Because it doesn't fit the narrative of the story being peddled by the press.

The preferred story-telling style is now that things are simple and clean and there are goodies and baddies and if at all possible we like to make it clear who the baddies are by suggesting they're just like those germans with the natty uniforms and the hats with the skulls on in the forties.  Nuance is to be avoided if at all possible.

A couple of years ago when the EDL were protesting in Bradford the police were out in force and the EDL people were kept within the reclaimed park area close to Forster Square station.  There was no significant trouble caused by the EDL, not necessarilly out of good comportment, but because the police did their job well.

However, there were people who covered their faces with hoodies and scarves clambering over people's cars and throwing things at the police.  This as an aside resulted in a number of people including myself being locked in a store *(after the shutters were lowered)* for about half an hour because the manager was afraid they'd put the windows in.

Now, in all fairness this wasn't major violence.  The police chased them off in pretty short order.  Normal service resumed.  There was absolutely nothing that justified significant press coverage in this.  **Except** that there was coverage of the EDL demonstration.  And, if you're going to make a significant news story about, *""A bunch of people held a meaningless protest and the police successfully maintained order""* in context, *""...while a seperate bunch of thugs ran amock in the name of counter-protest.""*probably would be contextually relevant.

Probably sells less papers than, ""Come sneer with us while we look at the racists!"" though and it certainly avoids having to have an adult conversation where you explain that pointing out that when a seperate bunch act like thugs that's not the same as being an apologist for the EDL.",0,1400773461,null,0,false,0,chogdg8,t3_267f19,t1_chogdg8,t1_chodl3l,null,1433908692,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; Well, let me explain the direction I think our military should go. 

I agree with that. Criminal that we ignore Darfur yet jump into Iraq.

&gt; If we are helping dozens of countries through disasters and helping build infastructure, feed people, give medical attention etc. we will be able to have truly strong alliances with them. Our trust doesn't need to based on something as flimsy as nuclear weapons.

The people you help will likely not be the very same people that take up arms later on and pose a threat.

&gt; I would also argue that having nuclear weapons make us more of a target to countries with nuclear weapons, not less.

Sorry but that is utter tosh. No country has dared to question our sovereignty in any military capacity since our possession of a nuclear weapon.

&gt; Also, even if we have another great depression (which seems like a realistic possibility) no one is going to invade the UK. Not in our lifetime atleast. 

Again, this is wishful thinking. Wait until people are hungry.
Considering we have no direct economic control (power of the market! :D) it always remains an undesirable possibility that we might return to warfare.  
You mention Europe but their far right is worse than ours. While I hope it never happens its still possible we will fight again.

&gt; What countries could realistically take us on?

In order of possibility: Russia, China, Israel, Pakistan, India The US, France. The ones that have nukes. 

&gt; The US? They aren't going to attack us, we .... fortunately have a strong relationship with them.

You seem to forget that once we were at war with our former colony. The Anglo-American loan agreement demonstrates how the US might behave should we go against their wishes in the future. It we want to remain politically relevant then we have the possibility of ruffling feathers.

&gt; We used to lead the world. I see no reason we couldn't do that again.

Riddle me this. What do the powers in the UN security council have in common?
This is the most significant chair in terms of international security and you have to be a member to stand any chance of ""leading"".

&gt; Dismantling our nuclear weapons is a first step. I'm absolutely an idealist. You may think that makes me naive. Personally I want to live in a Utopia (or at the very least play a major role in creating a Utopia for future generations). That isn't naive, its ambitious.

No, you're just a future dead person. The world is not nice, the world is cruel, bleak and unforgiving.   
People don't care unless we force them to care. We build a civilization upon these barren rocks, we structure it to reward those that care, are kind, are optimistic and are ambitious because we want that world to exist.  
However if the walls of civilization do tumble then that completely changes the ethics game.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Renting isn't all bad.  The problem is that this is a bit like having an article written by someone on a zero-hours contract that suits them and pays enough for all the bills and some pocket money left over.

I rent.  The flat I live in is a bit run down and could desperately do with renovation, but it's quite lovely and really pretty big and I pay less than what looks like the market-rate for where I am.  *(You probably have to look at the fact that the landlord probably needs to pour several thousands of pounds into bringing it up to scratch.)*

The letting-agent my landlord uses aren't precisely awesome but on the few occaisions I need something fixed they get someone out the same day.  *(Twice the locks on the door failed.  (The second time due to a bodge job on the first occaision.)  Once a pipe split after it froze.  Once the (fairly ancient) boiler died.)*

I am, as renters go, relatively lucky.

Then again, every year the rent does rise more than my salary does.  A couple of times a year I get sent a letter that says, *""We're coming to check on the property.  You don't need to be in.  We'll just let ourselves in and prowl around your home.""*  Although they haven't and I have no reason to anticipate it, my landlord could give me a couple of months notice to clear out.

I doubt they'd refuse me the right to moderate redecoration, but if I wanted to paint the walls a dark purple I doubt they'd go for it.  The kitchen and the carpets throughout desperately need updating.  The shower is old and feeble.  It needs a lot of work.  I'm not going to do it.  If I had a long-term lease I might.  If I knew I could stay ten years I might consider it worth spending my cash on carpets, or a newer shower.

The Weimar Republic comment in that article seems backwards.  From around 2004 I could see that the housing market was over-inflated.  I didn't seriously look at buying because a catastrophic crash was obvious and inevitable.  But what I didn't anticipate the desperate lengths the government would go to to protect the banks.  There was no market correction.  *(It took about a year for prices to return to pretty much where they were.  The over-inflation now is worse than it was in 2008.)*

In retrospect I was wrong not to buy on a 100% or close to 100% mortgage.  

It's not going to get any better.  The nearest I've seen to a proposed solution is Labour promising to build 200,000 houses a year by 2020 if they win the election.  It's not enough houses, it's too long in the future and promises have a tendency to get forgotten.

Many people aren't desperate to own their own home because of what the likes of the Guardian often diagnose as an inate desire to own property.

It fucks me off that the default reaction is to tell me to go and be a glory hunter just becasue I want to see the club have some god damm ambition and have the audacity to point out the fact that we have won nothing and have zero chance of competing in the Premiership for anything worth winning.

Everything I said is a FACT. We have won NOTHING. We have challenged for NOTHING. We have shown ZERO ambition. We have sold ALL our best players over the years. Its been the same under Learner and Ellis. Its been the same under every manager since Big Fat Ron. Its been the same for pretty much twenty fucking years. And the whole time, I have been there, credit card and ticket in hand, printing money for the club - and for what? 

We ARE a shit club. The Villa fans seem to have a shared delusion that we are something special. We are not. We are only there to make up the numbers. I've said numerous times that I personally want us to go down as it would make it interesting again, I think it would get my passion back..... as we are damm sure not going to win anything. Some day, I want to take my kids to see us fight for the title. But its never ever ever ever going to happen. Im just being realistic and Im not going to suddenly switch to Man City just becasue we are shit. But at least I accept that we are shit rather than live in this shared delusion of grandure. If we went down, who knows, I might at least be able to take my kids to see us fight to win the Championship. As it stands, all I can do it pay thousands a year to see mediocre nothingness. 

The other 5000 clubs do something. They go up, they go down, they have things happen. Not us. We are just mid to bottom table nothingness, there are never any really exiting transfers, never any particularly interesting media stories, never any particularly interesting gossip, we dont even have a universal character to hate. We are the epitome of a mid-table boring nothing ever happens team. We have been for 20 years. Next season will be the same. Too good to go down (sadly), not even remotely good enough to achive anything. At best we get a UEFA spot.... yay we quality for the tournament that we dont give a shit about so we play the kids in the semis. This is how its going to be for another 20 years, just like the past 20 years.  I want excitement. I genuinely hope the clubs sale is handled piss poorly and we end up going down. Ill buy my season ticket again then, just as it will be different.

Fuck me, the Blues might be shit, but at least they are going through something exciting. Even I was on my edge of the seat in their last game of the season. I couldnt give a shit about ours. Its wrong. But either way, I will be there next season yet again, letting the club rape me of my money...and for what?

&gt;**Q441:** Someone has left a car on my land, what should I do? *(This counts as your land, as you say in your answers that you own the spot)*

&gt;If you decide to move it yourself, or make arrangements for this to be done, you cannot have it moved straight away. **You should give the owner a reasonable amount of time (say, 14 days) to remove it**. The safest way is to put a notice on the car stating that if the car is still there after in 14 days time then you will have it removed. If there are number plates on the vehicle, send a recorded delivery letter to the registered keeper giving the same information (and keep the proof of postage and a copy of the letter). A Form V888 from the DVLA will get you registered details so long as your request is considered legitimate.

&gt;Once you have given reasonable notice that the car will be towed away you will prevent the owner from subsequently claiming theft or damage to the vehicle. **If you sell the car to, perhaps, a scrap dealer, you can keep the costs of removal, but any surplus should go to the proven owner if s/he ever turns up.** If the car is worth more than scrap value, then you may be best advised to seek legal advice from a Citizens Advice Bureau or solicitor as to the best course of action.

Looks like you can make some money too!

I rather agree with them, to be honest.

We don't have any major deposits of either in the UK, to my knowledge. What the UK needs (and I really don't see why this isn't something that could unite left and right) is energy independence, and renewables are the way to go for that.

&gt;&lt;Snip&gt;

&gt;It surely can't be too hard to apply some consistent standards to the rental market can it?

I think the simple explanation is a two-part thing.  Prior to Right to Buy councils maintained vast stocks of social housing.  Living in social housing was ordinary.

One of the major benefits of social housing is that it is *(or should be)* a basic standard at a basic price.  I think this was generally the case at the time.  This means that you have something like a national baseline standard and cost.  My flat is nicer than council flats I lived in in the past.  But if it was only a little nicer, I'd only be willing to pay a little more than the baseline cost.  If it was a **lot** nicer I might be willing to fork out considerably more.

Council housing is still really cheap.  But if you go to the council and say you're about to be made homeless and you'd like to be put on the list for a flat you're likely to be told the expected waiting time is years.  if you want to wait for a house with a little garden the waiting time could exceed your life-expectancy.  *(No, no source.  I indulged in a little hyperbole.)*

Because Right to Buy was so generous most people took it up and the people left behind were kind of the left behinds.  This is the start of where you get the thing of looking down at council tennants.  Just like most things you don't need all council tennants to be scum to make life Hell.  Just one will do...  

I lived many years ago in a huge block of flats where one tennant would play music soul-crushingly loud *(loud enough to be clearly audible well over 100m away)* until the early hours.  You call the police, they come out, the music goes down for a few minutes and then go back up, call them again.  At one point this person seriously beat another resident in the lift, after he'd been asked to turn the music down.  That earned him a custodial sentence, but it started again a few months later.

But just like, *""If not all, clearly MOST Romainians are thieves!""* and, *""If not all, clearly MOST Civil Servants are Lazy""* these people lead to, *""If not all, clearly MOST poor people are lazy, benefit-scrounging scum!""*  Sources:  London Met Police Force and the good folk of the Daily Mail.

Once you lose a baseline protection for housing it's left to the market to decide the price.  But it's not a free market like you read about in an introduction to economics book.  This is a market with heavilly constrained supply.  What should happen is that increasing costs due to demand outstripping supply leads to an increase in supply.  But *(and our planning and building regulations and a whopping dose of NIMBYism are major contributors to this)* this hasn't happened.

Then you get the Buy To Let investors who think and see in terms only starting and ending with money.  These people don't care if the rents are reasonable.  They don't care that the flat they're letting has plasterboard walls from one flat to the next.  They don't care that most Buy-To-Let housing is built with electric convection heaters rather than central heating, because it's cheap to install, even though it's too expensive to run.  They don't even want to deal with their tennants and so they use predatory agents who charge obscene fees.  

*(In the flat I stayed in before this one at one stage I had water pouring through a light socket in the ceiling.  The letting agent the landlord used told me they had called the agent used by the landlord of the flat upstairs and that was their responsibility discharged.)*

The solution is to fix the supply side of things.  If we did this you wouldn't need to regulate everything to death, since providing good quality housing, or a better service would lead to renters being willing to pay more money.  Unfortunately I think we're more likely to see a french style revolution with beheadings than a meaningful increase to the housing supply.",0,1400778115,null,0,false,0,choim8n,t3_267rii,t1_choim8n,t1_chohaih,null,1433909750,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Keep the annual mileage low, experiment how much having a higher voluntary excess will save you. I'm not sure if you'll get cheaper for only having ""Social and Domestic use"" or if ""S&amp;D and a single place of work"" changes. 

Were you a named driver on a car when learning? You're probably still active on that policy -phone that insurer and see if they can take that little bit of experience in to account as you'll be on their records.

If you add your parents (providing neither has a recent claim, ~5 years) as named drivers that can provide a big discount. It could even be worth having one of them as the main driver and having you as named, although this is only a good short term plan as you are unlikely to earn any no claims discount while doing this. You'll also need to make sure that they drive it as much as you do if you choose to have a parent as the named driver. 

Comprehensive policies can often be cheaper than 3^rd party, particularly if other benefits are taken in to account. It might also be worth investigating policies that put black boxes in to your car.

Back on point. 

Cardozo is awful. He's old. He seems to be only able to shoot with his left foot. He can barely beat a man. He is huge (like 6ft3 or 4) yet doesn't score headers, even from set pieces. He's slow and big yet gets shoved around as easy as Sterling did before he suddenly became as strong as The Hulk. He's spent like 3 months of this season injured. From what I've seen of him (around 10 games) he looks like a squad player for a West Ham or a Newcastle or Swansea. Not Liverpool, not by a long stretch. 

If he can't do it in the Portuguese league right now, what's going to happen when he's thrown in here? Aspas was good in La Liga and look at him.

Clearly, you've been loyal and I applaud that but the negativity changes nothing. I called you a glory hunter because you want a club that challenges for things, that has ambition. Villa doesn't and unless something drastically changes, it never will. I don't see what's wrong with that. I don't think we're special, that's the club I've always loved. I accept Villa for it is.

In the current format of the Premiership, ambition equals financial risk and we already tried that. Unfortunately, Chelsea, Man City and other bank rolled teams have shown more ""ambition"" (ie financial clout) than we have. To support ambition, is to support money backed wins and that's not why I'm a Villa fan. It's a crappy truth but that's the way it is.

I agree relegation and then a Championship run would be exciting but we haven't been boring all the time either. In the last 20 years, we've had tantalizing (and financially insane) attempts to break into Europe, relegation battles, some truly exciting players to watch (even if they haven't stayed), nurtured quite a few England players, a league cup win, new owners and sung Salifou to the tune of daddy cool. We had Paul McGrath's legend building performances despite battles with alcoholism, that Matt Lowton goal, Ashley Young's diving, Martin Laursen's knee's, Dean Saunder's tongue, Mellbergs beard, David Unsworths transfer and countless other narratives, legends and moments of hair pulling frustration and elation. 

The problems with Villa aren't Aston Villa problems, they're modern football problems. Ambition equals money and we're not that club. Modern football is boring because it's predictable, the league table may as well be a wage/fees table.

I want nothing more than to be proved wrong by scouse Cafu but his positioning is just awful most of the time (See Cardiff game 6-3 just from memory). Also, he's just not a great tackler I mean he didn't start every game and he was still dribbled by the most times in the league I'm sure some of this is down to his positioning too but at some point he needs to put a foot in.

I don't want people to think I don't like him because I realise he's kind of the youngster people want to see succeed and I do as well as I've said. But positioning and obviously tackling for a defender is incredibly important and he needs to dramatically improve on it. I think a lot of people are ignoring his mistakes because he gets stuck in at times and he's a proper scouser so people love him. I see some people saying we don't need to sign a rb/lb cause we have him and that's just nonsense he's nowhere near the level we need at the moment. I'd be playing him in the cup matches and maybe against a weaker team in the premier league if necessary and that's it next season while he improves his game.

I realise this may be an unpopular opinion so please argue your point instead of downvoting.


Edit: I didn't comment on his attacking play because his passing is good enough and his crossing is the least of my worries our defenders.

After that they had lost enough goodwill from the public that they are  screwed. If they threaten to leave, the Conservatives could have just accepted a general election knowing that the Lib Dems would have been wiped out. I'm not really sure about replacing Nick Clegg, they don't have an abundance of good candidates (since the next leader would have to be an MP). Other than Vince Cable they don't really have anyone that has any kind of public profile, and it doesn't seem like he is that interested in pushing it. Probably because he realises that the Lib Dems have no way where they can end up looking good.

So I think they were screwed as soon as the last election results came out, if the Conservatives had got a majority, they would have done well as an opposition party, and had the chance to gain a significant amount of support (especially when we consider with hindsight how poor Labour have been).

You could read it on his face when he had to come to collect something from the air, such as in corners, he didn't believe in himself.

* They refused to stand against a bill which would have locked ex-prisoners out of the democratic process

* As a nationalist party, they cannot command true support from across the community like Alliance can; Alliance is a party of unionists, nationalists, and everyone in between, by comparison the SDLP is a party of nationalists and nationalists only, except for their one unionist council candidate

* Neither socialism nor a shared future is their priority anymore, their priority is nationalism; hence, they are a typical orange vs. green party which cannot solve the two biggest issues in Northern Ireland: sectarianism and segregation

* They have literally done nothing recently beyond introducing that carrier bag levy

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"it's a valid point but, in my opinion, the Dutch league is a stronger competition than the SPL to start off with as there are few higher quality squads in the league with Feyenoord, FC Twente, PSV and Vitesse (granted Vitesse really now that they are Chelsea B for the most part).  The overall calibre player in the Dutch league is higher, it may be younger and less experienced than you would see in Scotland but there is much more talent not only in players but managers (Koeman, Cocu, Van Basten) in the Eredivisie than the SPL

Really i think it comes down to style of play....both Lennon and FdB were the big fish in the small pond but there is a distinct difference in how their teams play and how it would translate to the PL (as well as Europa/CL)...FdB may play a controlling possession based style of football but it still has the ability to be very attractive and is very organized.  

Lennon is a much less organized approach and his team plays a much less attractive style of football. You would think given the fact that Celtic are worlds better than anyone in the SPL they would be much more aggressive and entertaining but from what i have watch quite a bit of their play was stale and mind numbingly dull to watch.

Regardless of who the manager we appoint is we need to consider more than just success in another league when making the decision.

&gt; This SDLP council candidate has apparently been involved in drugs-type stuff

Really? Is that for sure? From what I read on that article there didn't seem to be any clear indication that he was a drug dealer. Just some social media hear-say, perhaps?

&gt; One of their MLAs had dodgy tax affairs, that Conall McDevitt boy

Fair enough, but he's one bad apple. No party has total immunity from unscrupulous types like him.

true,ggow,null,null,"First of all, the Bank of England is owned by the British Government. It issues British money, not English. Calling it 'English money' is either intended to rile people up or is because you're talking about something you don't understand. 

I'd love to know what your definition of 'real' is because being legal tender is a pretty poor definition. All 'legal tender' means is that someone is obligated to accept it to pay off debt if you present it for that purpose. Nothing more, nothing less. As far as I'm aware, McDonalds is no more obligated to accept BoE notes than Scottish Bank notes when you place an order because you're not technically paying off a debt. 

&gt; If it weren't for English money

And where does 'English money' derive its value from? Well, the Bank of England issues a promise but that promise is backed up by holding foreign reserves, gold, and through various other mechanisms. 'English money' holds no intrinsic value; it's value derives entirely from the strength of the promise the BoE makes. Similarly, the Scottish Bank notes derive their value from the strength of their promises; their promises are backed up by holding other assets i.e. BoE bank notes. 

Let's be honest here though, you're just trolling. Right? The simplest way to prove you wrong is to consider these: What came first, money or legal tender statuses? If legal tender came after money then 'legal tender' cannot be a part of the definition of money. As money preceded the concept of 'legal tender' then money need not be 'legal tender' to be considered as real money. Another thought, does the US Dollar cease to be real money when you remove it from the US and take it to the UK? It's clearly not legal tender here but it's still money.

So, going by loss % this year at Southampton (31.5%, 39.5% win this year)  you'd say that 15/16 Spurs have a good chance at winning the title if Rodger's first/second seasons and loss% are anything to go by.

39/31.5= almost 25% more losses for Rodgers at Swansea, 25% more wins for Poch at Southampton in their first full seasons in the PL v Rodgers at Swansea. So, extrapolating from there we can see 52.5% win (76 points) from Poch next season, 85% win and 105 points in his second. SIGN HIM UP!

Or, it's because it's printed by the bank of England and used predominantly in England and Wales, rather than NI and scotland that don't use their money directly. 

&gt; As far as I'm aware, McDonalds is no more obligated to accept BoE notes than Scottish Bank notes when you place an order because you're not technically paying off a debt.

no, they aren't. Your landlord is though, just like your bank. 

&gt; 'English money' holds no intrinsic value; 

Nothing has intrinsic value, this is a non-point. Reality doesn't care if you're trading in gold or copper or bits of paper that say they're worth money. 

What matters is that people give something value, and people give Scottish notes value because Scottish banks hold the amount they've issued in bank of england notes. Those banks could decide to start making their notes out of plastic, or kittens, or anything they want and the notes would be no more or less valid in a legal sense. Is it pedantic to make the distinction? maybe, but I'm not the one who started a page long conversation about it am I. If it really didn't matter then people wouldn't discuss it. 

&gt; If legal tender came after money then 'legal tender' cannot be a part of the definition of money.

that's some intro to philosophy shit, I'll think about that. On the other hand I've never said anything about money only being money if it's legal tender, and I've even called Scottish banknotes money throughout, so maybe I already know what you're saying.

true,ggow,null,null,"&gt;it's because it's printed by the bank of England and used predominantly in England and Wale

Being printed by the Bank of England doesn't make it English. The BoE is the UK of GB and NI's central bank. It is not England's. BoE is, in that regard, a bit of a misnomer. It is still quite common to use BoE notes in Scotland. As to the predominance of the English as users, that's mostly a factor of population size. BoE notes are British. Calling it English is wrong. 

&gt;Your landlord is though, just like your bank

Only if you're in debt to them. The bank need not accept a deposit in anything but legal tender. If you're paying in advance, the Landlord can specify the payment method and can specify whatever he wants, even banning legal tender. Either way, BoE notes are not legal tender in Scotland. No notes are. 

&gt;this is a non-point

But it's not a non-point. It's an important thing to remember. You're saying Scottish notes aren't real because they only hold value by virtue of the Scottish Banks holding BoE Notes. That's true but it doesn't make it any less 'real'. All money does that including the seemingly 'real' BoE notes; they're backed up by loads of different assets. I wasn't saying anything other than that; obviously the BoE can issue notes in what ever format it wishes. In that regard, it's just like the Scottish Banks. They can issue notes in whatever form they want so long as they're backed up by other assets. 

&gt;but I'm not the one who started a page long conversation about it am I

Actually, yes you did. 

&gt;If it really didn't matter then people wouldn't discuss it.

That's not true. People discuss interesting trivia all the time. 

&gt;that's some intro to philosophy shit, I'll think about that

It's not that difficult. If 'real money' must belong to the group 'legal tender', and that group doesn't exist, then 'real money' cannot exist. Given that we know real money predates the existence of that group, then belonging to that group cannot form a part of the definition of 'real money'. 

&gt;On the other hand I've never said anything about money only being money if it's legal tender

You seem to be saying that Scottish Money isn't real. It's clearly real money. I'm not going to reread all the comments to see if you did say it had to be legal tender to be considered real but I think you did. 

&gt;and I've even called Scottish banknotes money throughout

At the very least you said it wasn't 'real' money. What's the distinction between 'real money' and 'money'? There isn't one, at least not within this context. To say Scottish Bank Notes aren't real money is to say they're not money. You have been saying it's neither real money nor money. 

&gt; maybe I already know what you're saying.

I'm not so sure.

&gt;The national __flag of [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan)__ ([Dzongkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzongkha): ཧྥ་རན་ས་ཀྱི་དར་ཆ་; [Wylie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration): *hpha-ran-sa-kyi dar-cho*) is one of the [national symbols of Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_Bhutan). The flag is based upon the tradition of the [Drukpa Lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drukpa_Lineage) of [Tibetan Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism) and features [Druk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druk), the Thunder Dragon of [Bhutanese mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Bhutan). The basic design of the flag by Mayum Choying Wangmo Dorji dates to 1947. A version was displayed in 1949 at the signing of the [Indo-Bhutan Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan%E2%80%93India_relations). A second version was introduced in 1956 for the visit of [Druk Gyalpo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druk_Gyalpo) [Jigme Dorji Wangchuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Dorji_Wangchuk) to eastern Bhutan; it was based upon photos of its 1949 predecessor and featured a white Druk in place of the green original.

Flanno had a good season, id go as far to say a great season based on the start of the season expectations, he wasn't supposed to have featured anywhere near as much as he did but when we needed him he stepped up and never looked out of place or overwhelmed, the only game I honestly thought he looked completely shit in was against Newcastle but then again a few players did.

He's not the complete package but how many u23 year olds are? and how many u23 are playing in defence for the top 4/5 teams *anywhere* in europe? (in their leagues, not top 5 teams in europe)

the biggest complaint everybody has is he doesn't get forward enough or well but BR who specialises in attacking football im certain will be able to remedy that in no time, also its worth noting that not all defenders are developed to get forward like BR playing style requires so this is all new in the learning process for him and he honestly hasnt done that bad at it, while he might not get forward as often as we all like he rarely lets somebody pass him when he's in the way. His positioning can be a bit off but again i think that comes down to BR's playing style, when you are required to press and move up you can get caught on the counter and i think he's taken the blame for a lot of plays that were not his fault.",0,1400787898,null,0,1400788175,0,chonivj,t3_267zbf,t1_chonivj,t3_267zbf,null,1433912130,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

They can deliberately let peering links get congested without actually deliberately throttling the traffic. The proposals don't say ""you must always have enough bandwidth for the maximum demand to every site on the internet, ever"". It would be impractical to do that.

&gt; No. It could happen here. Yes we do have choice unlike those in the US, but this is still possible.

It's incredibly unlikely. We have tens of ISPs, a handful of which would be in any power to pull stunts, and where everyone can move to another ISP quickly and easily. 

That's why, without any legislation, our ISPs have engaged in good practices - for example, BT and Virgin are explicitly named as being part of the Netflix openconnect program, which necessitates free peering with Netflix and hosting their content servers within their network. Several ISPs have voluntarily agreed to ""be neutral"".

&gt; In fact, I think this was already a practice before net neutrality law came in effect, before then, some ISPs were throttling all bittorrent traffic. Now they don't do that any more because of the legislation.

This is the thing. There is no legislation, it is still a proposal. There's nothing to force ISPs to stop torrenting bittorrent, but those that did probably stopped because their competitors didn't do it.

You think people should vote even if their apathetic or not-interested. The other person thinks people shouldn't vote if they don't want to. Sounds as if you'd be in favour of compulsory voting.

The freedom is there for people to choose to vote or not. It isn't up to you to tell them whether they should vote or not. An addition of an abstention box on the ballot paper might help, but even then you have to care about politics enough to want to actually go through the process of crossing that abstention box.

Yes politics has an effect on the life of virtually everyone, but that doesn't mean all people care about it, and nor does it mean they have to care.

I have sympathy for people whose homes and businesses are threatened by the construction of the line - HS1 has shown that tunneling and 'cut and cover' styles of construction are possible. This must be looked at for HS2.

We do need HS2 though - by the end of the decade we will have replaced 125mph HSTs on the Great Western and East Coast lines with... 125mph Hitachi IEP trains. Not exactly brilliant progress in 40 years. We are way behind the rest of Europe on this - France now has [budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouigo) high speed rail, for example.

&gt; It is obvious that more capacity is needed, and from what I do know, upgrading existing lines would cost nearly as much as well as causes years of chaos.

If you don't build HS2 be prepared for every main line in the UK to be closed every weekend. [For 14 years](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/27/hs2-weekend-rail-closures-cost-backbench-mps). We can't keep tweaking our existing railway network.

The West Coast Main Line is the major problem for capacity. It's not just about passenger trains being full and standing, it's also a problem of how many trains can use the route. As demand for both freight and rail travel increases, this problem is getting bigger. Eventually the route will become 'full' - no more trains can use it So what do you cut? Express trains? Regional trains? Freight?

If you build HS2 you can leave the WCML to a few intercity trains, lots more regional trains, and a hell of a lot more freight. Which is another thing, transporting more freight by rail will also help our overcrowded road network.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Tight oil wells typically require directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”), which take lots of money and energy (not to mention water); initial production rates per well are modest, and **production from each well tends to decline quickly**. Therefore more wells have to be drilled continually in order to maintain a constant rate of flow. This has been called the “Red Queen” syndrome, after a passage in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass. In the story, the fictional Red Queen runs at top speed but never gets anywhere; she explains to Alice, “It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” **Similarly, it will soon take all the drilling the industry can do just to keep production in the fracking fields steady. But the plateau won’t last long; as the best drilling areas become saturated** with wells and companies are forced toward the periphery of fuel-bearing geological formations, costs will rise and production will fall. When, exactly, will the decline begin? **Probably before the end of this decade.**

Then mysteriously lost the relevant security footage.

Then the police told the press he had had an unrelated heart attack, that they had been helping him, and actually protecting him from bottles thrown by protestors, which turned out to be fabricated. Then they allocated a fraud and incompetent to provide the autopsy, which wrongly exonerated the police from all responsibility.

In both cases, the independent examination of police actions started more than a week after the event, and investigatory officers were drafted in from the police force which was accused of wrong-doing.

But the police do something completely trivial which directly affects a government minister (like heckle the Home Secretary at a police conference, or say that Andrew Mitchell called them Plebs), and suddenly reform becomes some vital and immediate necessity. These people are a joke.

I also think he can come across a bit diva-ish at times.

Nolan basically refused to take part in any training and the show became this weird farce in which Gerry would follow Nolan around and try to get him to do some exercise.

true,Quietuus,eng-wight,Vectis,"Yeah, we obviously want to avoid opening up new coal plants above anything else. However, I think there's a strong danger of nuclear vs renewables being treated essentially as an either/or option; nuclear power plants are very heavy engineering, a huge investment that will draw from the budget that could be spent on renewables which, as you say, take a long time to pay off; which means we have to invest sooner rather than later. Also, (and here I depart rather from the eco-hippie image) I think the kind of renewables we really need to consider are the dramatic mega-project sort of things; things like a tidal barrage on the Severn estuary. We also (and this is another reason why I'm supportive of the greens) need a government that's not afraid, quite frankly, to run roughshod over NIMBYs to get renewable projects in place, using whatever methods are available up to and including compulsory purchase. A lot of the technology and even a lot of the capital already exists, but things are constantly held back, mostly by 'country retreat' sorts who think being able to see a wind turbine from their house will devalue their property. We also have to keep in mind the total cost of nuclear going forward, including disposal and decommissioning; I know these are problems which better technologies and methods have severely reduced, but they still exist. A sensible compromise between the pro and anti nuclear camps would be to work out a clear long-term exit strategy from nuclear power and to make sure an amount of money is spent on renewables directly proportional to that spent on nuclear, including funds set aside for future decommissioning and an emergency fund for any possibly nuclear accidents (this would be a political gesture as much as anything, I think).

At this point not only is the car without an MOT, it's also without insurance. That's more than enough grounds for the police to seize the vehicle.

&gt;
&gt;You must have motor insurance for your vehicle if you use it on roads and in public places. 
&gt;
&gt;You do not need to insure your vehicle if it is kept off the road and declared as off the road (SORN). This rule is called ‘continuous insurance enforcement’.
&gt;
&gt;If not, you could:
&gt;get a fixed penalty of £100
have your vehicle wheel-clamped, impounded or destroyed
face a court prosecution, with a possible maximum fine of £1,000

I could see her getting a contracting job in a few weeks at most, a permanment maybe a month or two, depends how picky she is. There's a strong demand for medium term contracting jobs in the IT sector as well. 


I have no knowledge of your field, but there's plenty of finance companies in and around london, so certainly i'd expect less than 6 months.


Costs wise i'd expect a 2 bed flat that's 30 mins from the centre to be around £1300 a month, plus bills of probably another 300 or so.  Food is probably £75 a week , call it another £300. Travelcards will cost another £300 for both but those are only really for when you have jobs. for a single person sharing a 2 bed flat i spend about £1100 a month for everything, so about £2000 for 2 seems reasonable. 


One problem you might have, a lot of letting agencies will want 6 months rent up front for people coming from abroad , because they cant do a credit check on your finances. I know a few friends from abroad who have had that problem.

Its just that if every case now has a physical injury damage claim on top of the car claim its going to cost more.

Sorry I mean mortgaging away the future of all. That is you get a payout now but future people have to pay that money back into the system (higher premiums etc). Like the way that today's liability insurance costs makes it difficult to organise active public events (to insure against accidental injury for example) whereas in the past it would have been much cheaper.

Not once have I had that nervous feeling of turning it on in the morning and not knowing whether it's going to work or not. Not once have I had to worry about partitioning fucking drives to do a backup and worrying about whether one of them has corrupted. Not once have I had to worry that I'm missing the latest software/bug updated. Not once have I had to pay £120 a year that I used to pay for professional virus protection on PCs.

He has played RB quite a bit but I heard that was purposely to get him more comfortable/better on the ball so that he can be a ball-playing CB. Roberto has definitely said on more than occasion that he sees Browning as a CB. I definitely think we will see a bit of browning at some point next season. Maybe after a loan spell.

You don't need to be a mechanic to swap a busted hard drive or some fried RAM out of a computer, if something in my computer dies, i find it and swap it for something else. If a Mac dies and you dont have warranty or insurance, buy buy a new mac. 

Fair enough if you've got money to burn and can just be like ""Fuck it, I'm buying a mac because derp a derp a derp."" But paying over a grand for an entry level computer is fucking ridiculous. 

I paid £750 for my computer with a monitor and 3 years warranty and it's the equivalent of the £1,749 mac but I've got a better graphics card, how is that justifiable exactly?

Yeah, you pay a premium to not have to fix it. Macs only come in premium so they look more expensive, but it's hard to find, say, hardware that matches a Macbook Pro but that ships with Windows for appreciably less money. Windowsy laptops tend to be cheap and plastic and they tend to not last very long.

My Thinkpad is a well-built (ish) laptop that shipped with Windows 7 and cost about £30 less than an equivalnt (and prettier) macbook pro. £30 on a £1k laptop's really not a huge amount to pay for it to look nice.

No party is perfect, and we're no exception, but regardless of our shortfall on equal marriage within the Assembly, we still work very strongly for the LGBT community on all other issues, including tackling homophobia and standing up against Edwin Poots' gay blood ban.

Anyway, generally, apple's laptops are better designed and better made than their windowsy counterparts, they've had a habit recently of being where innovation happens (how the hell did it take this long to start increasing pixel densities in screens again?) and they are *so* much better supported since you can just wander into an apple store with one and get help with it. Though Lenovo are innovating with keyboard layouts, I suppose...


Apple own the whole system so it all tends to work better and some of us probably wouldn't fix our computers even given the ability to - I upgraded some of desktop a few months back and it was one of the most tedious things I've ever done. When I filled my thinkpad with juice the other month I spent on parts almost the cost of replacing it wholesale anyway...

Slight variances between elections (we have fancy pants electronic voting for our STV elections and stuff) but the general gist is that the boxes are emptied out first of all, and the votes are counted. This is to ensure that the number in the box tallies with the number of votes recorded for that box - make sure that someone's not been 'stuffing' the box. 

The next stage is a sort. So you put all the Labour votes in a pile. You put all the Tory votes in a pile, and so on. Normally this is done with like pigeon hole things and folk ""post"" them into the right pile. 

These piles are then counted into bundles of 100. Should be counted by more than one person. For political folk observing, this is when they tend to get involved, when they point out the ones that have been put in the wrong pile. Then you get a count of how many votes each party has... 

There's also the issue of questionable ballots. So the agents go up with the Returning Officer to go over any ballot that someone has queried. This includes the blank ones, the spoiled ones, any ballots with an identifying mark, and so on.

&gt;If elected I will stand but will not work for people who play dirty tricks and dirty politics.

It's sad and rather disappointing, especially with the timing, because they have at least proven there is an appetite for a party to fill that liberal pro-union gap. 

I would love to know what John McCallister was thinking by repeatedly bringing this dispute into the public domain via interviews. Especially given the sensitive nature of the 'rumours' (not even allegations yet) that should really be dealt with as quietly as possible until solid evidence one way or another is found.

Something seems very very off here.

I know it's also been rumoured that UUP have approached McCallister about moving back to UUP, and co-opting him into a seat, so I wonder if that has any role to play. (http://sluggerotoole.com/2014/05/21/ni21-was-john-mccallister-pushed-before-he-jumped/)

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"To use a food analogy: it may have all the same ingredients, but it uses a totally different recipe. There are no other episodes like it, which makes it a terrible representative of the whole (or even just the new) series. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a good episode - it's easily top ten material - but it's a terrible example of what to expect from the show.

The best introductory episode IMO is The Eleventh Hour. It does everything that you say Blink does: It shows that he's out saving the world and helping people, but it does a *much* better job.  I'd even go so far as to say that the episode is a microcosm of the series as a whole, that the story touches almost every point characteristic to the series. Most importantly, it gives a brief explanation of all of it (whether explicitly through dialogue or storytelling) which is actually an impressive feat in that it summarizes 50 years of storytelling.

New watchers will get a brief overview of who the Doctor is, along with a brief explanation of regeneration and the history of the character. They will see time travel, they will see aliens, they will see the iconic blue box, they will see him gain a companion, and they will see it presented in a manner representative of how the show normally goes.

Either way, he's proved this season that he still has what it takes to not just compete at this level but that we can rely on him in the #1 spot.  I think he has to be commended in his adoption of Martinez's system. You mention he doesn't really have many more touches than last year, but surely if you looked at the type of passes he's been making this season, youll see plenty more balls spreading the play and dictating the game from the back rather than long balls up to Jela/Fellaini that was the norm last season. Howard's play has change dramatically, he's far more often put under pressure and forced to make accurate passes and thoughtfully distribute the ball whereas last year it was more, 'ok we're in trouble, lay it back to Tim so he can hoof it out of here' mentality. 

I think you're right in terms of the increase in shots that we're allowing. Our team moves much more fluidly and defensively we're hard to break down with lots of players getting behind the ball as soon as we lose it. We're seeing a lot more frustrated shots from range which Howard is able to deal with, so I definitely don't believe that it's a concern, more of a mild statistical drawback of Martinez's system.

He goes on to say

&gt; Labour MEPs have condemned the mass surveillance programmes used by the US and EU member states where meta data was not used for security purposes but could be leading to serious violations of the law and privacy, including evidence used in secret courts.

So there's some context to an out of context quote you picked from his thoughtful, page-long response so you could get your pathetic, angsty little ""fuck you"" out.

EDIT: other highlights

&gt;The European Parliament report has a host of recommendations, including a digital bill of rights or digital habeas corpus, increased international protections for journalists and whistleblowers, as well as proposals to strengthen EU cloud computing (but not to fence us off) and proposals on IT security and encryption standards.

Hey, i bet you read that before making your dumb remark

&gt;In order to safeguard the high standards of data protection in the EU and the existing EU-US transatlantic agreements concerning data transfers from EU citizens to the US, it is clear that there should be no inclusion of data protection provisions in the TTIP agreement, leaving this instead to both the current EU data protection legal framework and existing and upcoming international agreements.

Labour MEPs have been actively involved in shaping the EU's data protection laws. You probably cannot tell me what they are or involve. Maybe you should try googling.

&gt;In respect of net neutrality, which is point 3 on the Charter, Labour MEPs are in favour of as much protection as possible for consumers through allowing access to internet services for all, however, complete unrestricted access to the internet and online services should not come at the expense of authorities being able to block and restrict illegal images and materials.

which is something I never claimed. Stop making straw man arguments please, all you're going to do is mislead people who are skimming our posts and not paying full attention.

Well that's debatable. It's no more or less real than a piece of paper with ""I'll give you five quid"" written on it in crayon, wheras BoE coinage and in some places notes have actual legal meaning and value.

no

people don't get angry over it, which you guys seem to be. All I did was point out that scottish money is printed by a private company who can do whatever they want with no real consequence, and you're all mad because of that. 

&gt; If 'real money' must belong to the group 'legal tender', and that group doesn't exist, then 'real money' cannot exist.

Or alternatively, definitions change over time?

&gt;You seem to be saying that Scottish Money isn't real.

no, I just think it's utterly arbitrary what form it comes in. The company that makes it can replace notes with elephant dung if they want, and nothing will actually change. If that happened for BoE notes or coins people would care, though.

It's name is an historical artefact; it doesn't set the nationality of the currency it issues. The Pound Sterling, currency code GBP, which the BoE issues is British. 

&gt;which is something I never .... Paying full attention. 

Pecten if you hadn't said it, I wouldn't be a straw man. You did though, and you were wrong. 

&gt;well that's debatable....meaning and value

Obviously it's debatable, we're debating it. I think you'll find that it is more real as the weight and degree of promise placed in the promissory note is far higher than a piece of paper with crayon writing. I mean, you're right, that crayon note could have as much value as a fiver but no one accepts it as having that value, ergo it's not real. 

Also, the GBP does not have a legislated value, just legal tender status. That does not bestow upon it value; that derives from the same place as the Scottish notes: A promise that ultimately goes back to the Bank of England's governor and the credibility of the Bank of England as a company. If there was a legislated value there would be no exchange rate fluctuation. The GBP is a free floating currency, it has literally the opposite of a legislated value.

I'm not angry. I'm bemused by your ignorance.

In this case they haven't. Not in the manner you're meaning. 

&gt;it's utterly arbitrary what form they come in

The same can be said of literally every currency in the world. Paper and coins are a convenient way to do it  therefore it's used. The Bank of England could decide that they'd face in toenail clippings as a currency tomorrow and there be very little that the Government could do about it. The same is true of the ECB and The Fed and so on. So long as the promises backing the medium app are credible, and people are willing to accept the notes(which really derives from the promise) the currency has value.

So it's around 75% of Scotland, which is useful to get a sense of scale. But that's still less than 7% growth in 10 years for the total population. 

Now you raise good points about the need for additional infrastructure and services. Well let's look at the main reasons of migration (source: http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/long-term-international-migration-flows-and-uk) 25% arrive with a definite job and a further 35% arrive for formal education. The ones arriving for definite jobs are providing income which can  used to pay for any additional expenses, they are also people that have been specifically recruited by companies due to their skills which are probably in limited supply in the UK. The people arriving for formal education are paying significant fees and are also generally here on short term visas, with significantly high proportions leaving after their education, (which is actually part of the reason we see such large emigration figures from the UK).

The parts which may cause concern are the 28% that come, looking for a job (13%), other (10%), no reason stated (5%). This works about to about 125,000 people for the current year, however there is not much clear about the other and no reason stated. 

Anyway we've managed to reduce the people of concern from 4 million in 10 years to 1.25 million in 10 years. So to add a burden equivalent to the population of Scotland it would take over 40 of this years worth of immigration. This is in the worst case where all 28% of these immigrants are providing nothing for us. I think in reality this is likely to be much less but I accept I can't prove that with the data available. Anyway in 40 years time I believe we will be thankful for all this excess immigration, when we are trying to support our rapidly aging population. Luckily for us, most of these immigrants are young.

First off, we aren't going to hold out for Jurgen.  We are trying to settle the management position sooner rather than later be it Poch, FdB or by some ridiculous miracle Ancelotti. We won't hold the position for Klinsmann.

Secondly, the US just gave Klinsmann a long term extension.  They also gave him the keys to the castle when he first signed on so that he would have control from senior side down.  The extension wasn't rooted on just his performance with the senior side, it was also a reflection of the work he has done with the other levels.  He has built the plan that the US are sticking with moving forward.

Landon may be decorated and popular but as talented as he is the USMNT's success or failure at the WC was never going to be decided by just a single player.

You win one of these stupid competitions and get a chance with the team. You really impress Rodgers, and he wants you to come back for a few more days. You keep on impressing him, and he wants you to take part in some training session matches to see how well you do.

To everyones surprise, you do really well and even score the most goals! This goes on for a few more days and BR decides to sign you on a 20k a year contract. Nothing too big so if it doesn't work out, like it likely will, then nothing is lost. 

You don't even make the bench for the first few weeks, but then Sturridge gets injured, and you're brought onto the bench, just incase. Nobody has any idea who you are, and when they find out you've never played a match, they laugh at you.

It's a match against United at Anfield and we're 2-0 down with 15 minutes to go. Borini isn't looking great, and there's nothing to lose, so Rodgers throws you on. With your first touch of the ball, you score a tap in! It's a dream come true! A few minutes go by and the ball falls to you just outside the box. You see the headlines, and you go for it.. and it's right in the top corner!! But the job isn't over yet.

In the last minute, you pick the ball up at the halfway line and do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vmm-xCq4To). Everyone goes wild! You're famous! now you're on a 20k a **week** contract! Then you do the same against Chelsea &amp; Arsenal &amp; Everton and you're breaking the scoring records! Now Real Madrid want to sign you and people are calling you the best player ever!

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"I'll give another shoutout to /r/IWantOut - there's a lot of knowledge there.

I've done exactly what you did, minus the partner and kids. /u/buried_treasure is right that the spouse visa requirements were made much more stringent about two years ago and your husband must basically already have a job in the UK that pays good money or you might be out of luck from the beginning. However, don't let that stress you too much. Have a look at the UKBA site or just ask on /r/IWantOut.

Rent prices are very high throughout most of England, although depending on which part of Chicago you live in, you may very well find Leeds more affordable. It's also a nice city.

Don't worry too much about shipping stuff as I typically advise people not to take too much. Most electronics designed to heat up, or that have a spinning motor, won't work in the UK. Only electronics with some sort of AC/DC converter built in will work properly, so things like computers and most charging units are fine. Don't anticipate bringing any TVs. DVDs and Blu Rays are in a different region. You can pick up a multi-region player in the UK for relatively little money, so don't bring one from America. Plan to buy most of your electronics in the UK. Bring a long a small stack of US Letter sized paper - it's not used anywhere outside of parts of the Americas, so if you need to print out a form for the US and mail/fax it over, the extra paper might come in handy.

Financially, your husband will have to do most of the heavy lifting. Until you've got permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain), you won't be able to register on the electoral roll, which is one of the key components to qualifying for credit in the UK. Some banks might offer you a handful of cards with low limits and high interest rates in the meantime, but expect any major credit purchases to have to be done in your husband's name until you're permanently resident. Also note that credit history does not transfer to other countries, so you'll start over again in the UK with a blank slate.

Americans *cannot* exchange their driving licences in the UK and must go through the entire testing situation all over again. As soon as you can, apply for a provisional licence. You do not need to pass any tests to receive this, and there's no time limit between getting your provisional licence and testing for the full licence. I *highly recommend* taking driving lessons - ask locals for recommendations for a driving instructor. Driving conditions in the UK couldn't be more different from most of the US. If you can't drive a manual car, you'd better learn, since most instructor's cars are, and if you pass the driving test in an automatic, you'll receive a restricted licence that only allows you to drive automatics. This could hinder employment prospects if a company car is common in your field, and you intend to work. Before you leave, get a record of your no claims bonus and driving record from your current insurer and state DMV. Some insurance companies in the UK do occasionally exercise discretion and offer lower rates to people with good driving records from other countries.

If you intend to work, make an appointment with your local JobCentre as soon as possible to apply for a National Insurance number. You'll need this in most situations in accepting a job, anything related to tax, and the NHS. Also sign you and your family up for a local GP sooner rather than later. Note that your husband might technically have to wait for 12 months to 're-establish' residency in the UK before being allowed to use NHS services free of charge. However, as landed immigrants with leave to remain, you and your son can get them from day one. Bring records of all immunisations and doctor's notes detailing any and all medications you three currently take. Your UK GP will work with you to get the prescriptions filled in the UK.

Chicago clothes will work well enough and if you want to keep costs down, bring as many of them as you can and plan to dress in layers. Winters in the UK aren't technically that cold based purely on temperature, but when you factor in the rain, damp and incessant wind, a temperature reading of around freezing can quickly feel much, much colder. The only small thing I'll caution is that the American sense of style can often look a good 10 years or more out-of-date in the UK, so if you do find yourself with disposable income, it wouldn't be terrible to have a look at the locals and then buy what you see as you find it. Americans do have a habit of sticking out like a sore thumb due to the very casual ill-fitting 1990s looking clothes, by UK standards. Also, shoe sizes are marginally different in the UK, so learn your new size. It would even be worth learning both your UK and EU shoe sizes, since I'm increasingly seeing shoes in stores with no UK sizes printed on them.

In terms of shipping other items, you could bring any furniture that has particular financial or sentimental value. I would warn against bringing beds and mattresses. Mattress sizes in the UK are different from the US, and you'll have a hard time finding sheets that fit well on a US mattress. Also, most people in the UK only use a bottom fitted sheet on their beds, and cover themselves with a duvet (basically almost the same as a comforter) with a washable duvet cover. Because of that, many stores in the UK have a very limited selection of both fitted and flat sheet packs, with most stores just selling fitted sheets separately. If you really want that top sheet, you'll need to spend extra, and don't be surprised if you sleep at someone's house and there's not one on the bed.

Try to acquaint yourself with Celsius and leave Fahrenheit behind at the departure terminal - few people under retirement age really get Fahrenheit and the temps won't be reported. Resist the urge to convert and just get used to feeling things in Celsius. Same goes with the metric system in most uses. On the other hand, most people in the UK weigh themselves in stone and pounds, not pounds alone like the UK. A stone is 14 pounds, so a weight would be something like 10 stone 6 pounds, which is 146 pounds. Or you can say fuck it, be a rebel, and weigh yourself in kilograms only.

Make mental notes of different words and terms used to describe things as you hear them. For the most part, you'll need to remember words that exist in both places but have different meanings, eg. 'fanny' (US, cheeky term for rear end, UK rather slang term for vagina). A big one to watch out for: spaz or spastic. I know in the US this is a somewhat light-hearted term referring to someone who acts a bit strange or hyperactive. In the UK, it's consistently voted as the most offensive word there is, where it's become used as a vulgar insult for people with cerebral palsy and other mental disorders. DO NOT, under any circumstances, throw it out in public. Most people in the UK aren't aware that it has virtually no negative connotations in the US, and Tiger Woods got in a LOT of trouble when he said in a British TV interview that he was off his game one morning and, ""playing like a spaz."" Don't make his mistake.

The system of choosing schools is rather different than that in the UK, and there's a lot more freedom to choose schools in your area and less of a rigid 'catchment' grid drawn up by the school board like in America. As a result, applications for good schools in the local area are often quite intense. Check online (a site like mumsnet.com) and ask locals for references as to which schools are the best. The proximity of your house to a preferred school *is* still a weighted factor, so do bear that in mind, but don't think it's the be all and end all like it can be in the US.",0,1400814399,null,0,false,0,choz12x,t3_268dr3,t1_choz12x,t3_268dr3,null,1433917619,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9
true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"PART 2:

A lot of food stuff you like in the US won't be available in the UK. This is especially true of 'junk food'. There are surprisingly few cereals in the UK, and even fewer with all the shitty sugar and fake chocolate shit crammed into them. No Lucky Charms, Apple Jacks, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cereal - the breakfast foods look like a health foods store. Eggs in the UK are processed differently and *shouldn't* be refrigerated unless they were sold that way. Leave them on the counter or in a cupboard. Expect to have to make do with the ingredients you have, and know that you'll have a hard time reproducing most American recipes because you'll always be missing at least one ingredient it seems. Go with the flow and learn to make stuff people in the UK do. Also take advantage of the excellent Asian food shops and make more international cuisine. Mexican food is almost impossible to find throughout the UK - I've only seen a handful of proper Tex-Mex restaurants in London, and it's still just not the same.

On the whole, you'll love it if you get used to being in a different situation and learn to accept and adjust. Despite what most people in the UK seem to believe, the UK genuinely is 'European' and *quite* different from American culture in general. People have a totally different outlook and way of viewing things. I typically find that some Americans totally get it, fold into society, and never leave. The rest Skype their relatives constantly, watch NBA games on their laptop and moan about how things close early. They don't last that long. If you don't mind me asking: what are some absolute 'essentials' - things like television, sports, restaurants, etc. - that you genuinely don't think you could do without? I can try to advise on that integration side of things. I would recommend getting up to speed on British pop culture by watching television and asking your husband to explain references. So much of British humour is based on referring to television personalities from the 1980s and local/regional stereotypes about accents, behaviours, famous residents and whatnot. In that sense, it's somewhat inaccessible to foreigners who don't get the inside jokes. All that aside, if you are good at adapting and up for something new, you'll love it.

EDIT: Don't forget that as a US citizen, you're still required to file federal (and possibly state) income taxes regardless of where you live or earn your money. This is a pain in the UK because the tax year is different, so you might have to ask any employer to recalculate your earnings and tax withheld based on the US tax year, or simply nominate a different tax year to the IRS. Most big online filing services like H&amp;R Block and TurboTax can do foreign taxes. Also, your child will be required to file upon reaching age of 18.

Another thing to do before leaving: renew any identity documents that might be expiring, particularly your driver's licence. You can't renew abroad so it's worth doing if it's expiring soon-ish. Also make sure that you've got legal copies of vital records like a marriage certificate and birth certificate, since you'll be needing to refer to these a lot. Try to set up a UK bank account as soon as possible after arriving. American debit and credit cards are some of the last in the world to still use the magnetic swipe. All of the UK has got a chip in the card that's validated by your PIN during each transaction, so some shops and restaurants aren't even able to accept swipe cards any more. The sooner you get a UK payment card, the better. Setting up utilities for your house is virtually the same as in the US.",0,1400814417,null,0,1400814812,0,choz1ba,t3_268dr3,t1_choz1ba,t1_choz12x,null,1433917621,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

 [**Safe standing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe%20standing): [](#sfw)

&gt;__Safe standing__ is a term used to describe various design options in stadia to allow spectators to stand at events. It is primarily used in the context of [football in the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_United_Kingdom), where a series of fatal incidents led to legislation requiring major clubs to develop [all-seater stadiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-seater_stadium) during the 1990s. Since then, fans groups have campaigned against the ban on standing accommodation, arguing that new design options would allow designated standing areas to be built in compliance with all safety laws and guidelines. As these options are outlawed in [England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales), safe standing in practice originated in continental Europe, primarily Germany. This occurred because although [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) and [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) required all-seater stadiums for international competition, it was not mandatory for domestic matches.

I am a second semester student in oil painting at a junior college here in San Diego, and the assignment was to paint something with atmospheric interference -- in this case, it's the foggy gloom. Of the 3 paintings we did this semester (fire, underwater, atmospheric interference) one had to have a person in them. For me this was it. My teacher said that Doctor Who would still count as the theme, because it's celebrating 50 years of British pop culture, and DW is part of that.

**Edit: clarified why I mentioned the Beatles.**

It's my first time painting faces as well as people and fabric. Mistakes were made, but I stand by my submission. I even framed it in a TARDIS blue frame.
