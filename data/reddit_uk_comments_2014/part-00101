It takes more effort to build a good farm system than to build a good first team, because it's not as simple as throwing money around.

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","&gt; Now you're probably wondering why I posted this here. If I were to say this in the street I could well be arrested for hate crimes.

I honestly don't think you would, if you explained your opinions like you have here. Screaming ""I hate muslims!"" might get you in trouble, but that's not really the same. 

&gt; I can't stand people who actually support women not being allowed to leave their houses without a man. (As is the law in many Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia)

But how many people do that here? I think treating women as second class citizens is abhorrent too, but saying that someone who's muslim automatically thinks that's ok isn't right. I'm sure an awful lot (majority? no idea) of muslims think that's wrong too.  

Being against muslims you meet in the street because you assume they're ok with the idea of women being kept housebound, that really is just racism. 

Saying you're against muslims because of that is a little like saying you're against the UK/white people/christians because of the Iraq invasion. 


&gt; However, if a Muslim woman walks up to me in a complete burqa (not a niqab, a burqa) and I can't make eye contact then I won't connect with that person, anyone could be under there, the main reason I hate Islam is because if she took it off her family would most likely berate her for it.

You may be right, and that situation is wrong. However, I think I've only seen a full burqa once. How often do you see one? Bearing in mind I work in Bradford, there's not that many of them about. To be honest, I don't see many face covering veils either, though a huge number of women wear a headscarf.

Y'what? I said:

&gt; People are not allowed to say these things with their own identity because we've accidentally turned things like racism into a scar as opposed to a treatable disease.

i.e. racists are often demonised in our current society.

&gt; We need to be able to accept racists as part of our rich culture and let them air their views (irrespective of how ignorant we might feel them to be). If we force them to bottle up like they do now the pent up frustration just manifests itself in other, potentially more dangerous ways.

There have been studies done on religiosity vs x where x is something bad like wealth, violence, crime etc. and in just about every case it seems that increased religiosity is a disadvantage, sometimes a severe one.

But, even without doing any studies we know that it's the scientific approach as opposed to the religious one which has yielded *all* the advances in medicine and technology.  We live decades longer than we used to because of advances in rational thought - not because of people who tried praying harder.

And I think that it's hard to imagine concluding that the rise of the burkha, the hijab and the treatment of women in Muslim societies is anything other than because of cultural-religious reasons.  It should be no more controversial than the claim that Western opposition to gay-rights and women's reproductive rights is motivated by conservative Christianity.

Outside of the West, there are several countries which proscribe the death penalty for homosexualtiy and/or atheism.  I think, without exception, all of them are Muslim states.

And finally, you don't need to be a statistician to deduce that the deeply religious of all stripes are likely to be in opposition to concepts like the true age of the universe or evolution.

So, yes, it's a good debate tactic to insist on scientific proof when confronted with a claim that you find distasteful, but in this case I don't think it really washes.  It doesn't wash any more than someone in a historical debate insisting on scientific proof that fascism was a harmful ideology.

true,InitiumNovum,irish,Ireland,"&gt; According to McGuinness he left the IRA in 1974, at which time he was apparently a local commander in Derry. Is your speculation based on anything which proves otherwise?

Well he's clearly lying, he was caught several times during the 80s using ""we"" when talking about the IRA and its activity at that time, it's pretty obvious who he was engaged with. He just kept quite about it because he was entering politics and didn't want his affiliations to muddy his chances of getting elected. Sinn Féin during that time was basically the political wing of the PIRA. It's a similar story with dissident Republic organisations today in Ireland and their associated political wings, for example, the RIRA has a political wing called the ""32 County Sovereignty Movement"" and you can bet that everyone in the 32CSM is a member of or gives some assistance to the RIRA. 

&gt; Your absolutist position would seem counter-productive to me. History gives us many examples of those who sought to violently oppose the forces of the state (and indeed oppose other paramilitary forces) and who are later awarded political roles, honour and respectability. It is only with your enemies that you can make peace, and the peace process owes a lot of its success to McGuinness.

You should make peace with the innocent, but not with the guilty. Let's not forget that McGuinness has never apologised for his involvement in the PIRA. Those on either side of the divide, either on the loyalist side or the republican side, who were involved atrocities should not represented future generations of Irish or British people.

The choice of forming a government composed of both majority and ""opposition"" parties seems to be quite a deliberate choice to compel cooperation in the aftermath of a long, divisive and bloody civil-war. 

The alternative would appear to be having successive governments formed by majority unionists, and a return to armed struggle. Nice one!

true,stevemegson,null,null,"Lots of hire companies will offer day hire, but anything shorter will probably be hard to find (of course if you hire the boat for the day and bring it back early they won't complain). Your main problem is that narrowboats cover 3 miles per hour on a good day before you take off 15 minutes or so to work each lock, and places to turn around could easily be a hour apart. If you only want to be out for 3-4 hours then you need a very conveniently-placed hire company to put a couple of locks and a turning point in range.

From [Rose narrowboats](http://www.rose-narrowboats.co.uk/day_boat.htm) the nearest lock would be around a six hour round trip to Hawkesbury junction and you can turn there too, but it's a terribly boring lock with a rise of just six inches. In the other direction, Hillmorton locks are more satisfying and have a tunnel on the way, but the round trip would be a full day of eight hours or so.

[Anglo Welsh](http://www.anglowelsh.co.uk/dayboats.php) near Stratford is more promising if you want locks, with six within three miles. You could make that round trip in a bit more than four hours, but once you go through the first lock there's no turning back early if you get sick of working locks. In the other direction, you could cover two locks each way within four hours or so, or turn around after the first.

[Union Canal Carriers](http://www.unioncanalcarriers.co.uk/day%20boat.htm) in Braunston would give you the option of heading up the six locks of the Braunston flight and through the mile-long Braunston tunnel before turning around, but you're committed as soon as you set off because there's nowhere to turn around on the way.

I'm not going to go too in depth into this as I don't have the time, but I'll link a few clips below which are highly suggestive of McGuinness' direct involvement with the PIRA during the 80s. 

""... we don't believe that winning elections and winning any amount of votes will bring freedom in Ireland. At the end of the day, it will be the cutting edge of IRA which will bring freedom.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzvpMlHuIrs

Here's another suggestive video where McGuinness talks about the consequences of IRA members acting treacherously. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch5u8YbOyIE

He's another extremely suggestive video where McGuinness is giving a speech to Sinn Féin members. Notably he says ""The reaction of the British government to the IRA's military campaign and Sinn Féin's successful electoral strategy in the six counties is testimony enough to that government's inability to overcome the resistance of a new generations of IRA freedom fighters, supported on equal terms by articulate and committed Sinn Féin freedom fighters.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMkr4ifDtOA

There are also interviews from whistle-blowers about McGuinness' and Adams' direct involvement in IRA operations. Unfortunately, one such key interview is under lock and key in Boston College in the US despite many attempts by the British authorities to get hold of those tapes -- the content of those tapes were brief  on by a former PIRA member, Delores Price, from the late 90s onward; she, along with her sister, Marian Price, participated in the bombing of the Old Bailey in London in 1973 which injured 200 people. 

&gt; So, no room for Mandela love in your position then? Anyone involved in any War of Independence? any Civil War? any resistance to a brutal regime? None of them have any hope of a role in peacetime? 

I have sympathy for Mandela because he was fighting a fascist state. I have sympathy for the early Irish republican movement because they were fighting against the likes of the Black and Tans who were notoriously brutal. I have no sympathy for the IRA during the Irish Civil War, they rejected the democratic decision of the Irish people to agree to the Ango-Irish treaty, most Irish were more pragmatically in that they didn't want an unnecessary long bloody drawn out war with Britain in which they would likely lose. The IRA was not a necessary or justifiable force during most of the Troubles. One might argue that it was necessary up until the disbandment of the Stormont government, which had no regard for the civil rights of Irish Catholic in Northern Ireland, but not afterward.

""Eihei Dogen (1200-1253) brought Soto Zen from China to Japan and is one of the most revered masters in the history of Zen. In the Raihai Tokuzui, Dogen said, ""In acquiring the dharma, all acquire the dharma equally. All should pay homage to and hold in esteem one who has acquired the dharma. Do not make an issue of whether it is a man or a woman. This is the most wondrous law of the buddha dharma.""

In the 13th century here is a zen master saying that women and men are equal. Again:

""On the other hand, the Vimalakirti Sutra teaches that maleness and femaleness, like other phenomenal distinctions, are essentially unreal. ""With this in mind, the Buddha said, ’In all things, there is neither male nor female.’"" The Vimilakirti is an essential text in several Mahayana schools, including Tibetan and Zen Buddhism.""

The cultures surrounding buddism itself may have been sexist but buddha himself was not

""The Buddha admitted there was no reason a woman could not be enlightened.

In general, I would always suggest thinking about what you will say to them before doing so. Telling the truth can be a form of self-incrimination.


As an example, say you are doing 35 in a 30 and drive past a parked police car. You notice and slow down to 30, but it's too late, they are following you now. 500 yards down the road the lights go on and you get pulled over. The first questions will involve you are your vehicle (name/insurance/owner), answer these truthfully. When it comes to the question ""Do you know how fast you were going"" just answer ""Yes"". Don't tell them how fast you were going, they are fishing for evidence to give you points and a fine. 


Also, don't be a dick. Get watching those reality cop shows and you will soon realise the people that get taken back for more questioning are the people who give the most hassle. Be helpful and direct.

true,Andures,null,null,"Denial of what? I'm not even a Chelsea fan. The problem I have is the idea that Chelsea/Manchester City/PSG are being operated in a farcical manner. They are not. They spend money that they have. Talking about net spend is pointless, unless their negative net spend is in debt that they are unable to repay. A wealthy person can afford to operate a business at a loss for a longer period of time, a poor person cannot. Farcical is spending money that they do not have, something which Chelsea/Manchester City/PSG do not have a problem with. 

&gt;The oil rich clubs will keep using dubious revenue streams (Man City sponsors themselves) 

Hahahaha. You mean the sponsorship that has been cleared by UEFA? Is Liverpool's sponsorships by American companies that have ties with FSG (like Warrior and Dunkin Donuts) dubious? 

&gt;but if they had to stand on their own finances like most clubs they would go over like a lead zeppelin.

Are you saying that Manchester City, Chelsea and PSG will all crumble in the next 2 years due to FFP? 

Manchester City currently has the 6th highest income in the world. Liverpool is around 80 million behind them. City is able to spend 80 million more than Liverpool annually. Over 5 years, that is 400 million more than Liverpool. 

Chelsea's revenues are about 60m more than Liverpool annually. They've spent, on average, about 40m more than Liverpool annually for the last 5 years. They are actually being prudent. 

Net spending looks only at the buying and selling of players, which is in no way the primary revenue generator for clubs, so using that is insane. 

If you want to talk about debt, Liverpool has been averaging 40 to 50 million losses annually for a while now, and the owners are definitely not oil rich billionaires. I strongly suspect that if, right now, all the owners are prevented from putting in any additional cent into the clubs, Liverpool's legs might be much wobblier than those of Chelsea, Manchester City and PSG.

The third clip is particularly interesting, in that he clearlly makes a distinction between both the leadership and the members Sinn Fein and the IRA, as he speaks in favour of Sinn Fein taking seats in the Dáil, rather than have republicans rely solely on violence. 

So, no... none of this supports your allegations that McGuinness' membership of the IRA continued past 1974, that he ordered the murder of Lord Mountbatten, and that he ordered the Brighton bombing.

Are you saying that those you have sympathy for shouldn't be given public attention and should have to live with their legacy?  Or does that not apply to them for the reasons you sympathise with them?  If that's the case, your pronouncement might need some clauses in there to make it less prohibitionist and more reflective of your actual position.

&gt;Dressing like it's 500bc in the 21st century, supporting sharia law in the UK, large percent of their community not working, forming ghettos, etc they don't respect our laws, culture, or people.

Another sweeping generalisation. This would be hardline, fundamentalist Muslims and are not representative of Islam as a whole. Any form of fundamentalism, not just religious, behaves this way so to ascribe this to Islam is fallacious. You can't spell fundamental without mental...

&gt;The average muslim in UK wears religious clothing 24/7, supports sharia, and is religiously fanatical.

No, they really don't. The ""average Muslim"" you are talking about would again be a new-wave immigrant with no grasp of the local culture. History has proven time and time again that this is nothing to do with Islam (rather it is to do with being non-native in a new culture) and that this assimilation takes several generations to occur.

I do agree with your interpretation in many ways, but it is important not to paint Islam with this brush. To make such a sweeping generalisation only serves to stifle the discussion. Ever wonder why you can't discuss these issues without being called racist? It is because for every intelligent and honest discussion there is, there are at least 5 other people making blanket statements which gives those who practice these things the shroud of persecution under which to hide.

true,UndercoverFiretruck,1986,,"For the sake of adding discussion and not just calling you crazy, Di Maria has been used by Ancelotti similar to the role you're suggesting this season along with Modrić and Alonso in Madrid's 4-3-3. Partially because Bale took his spot on the right, Khedira got injured, and because Isco lost form, he's been working that midfield for a while now. He usually presses all over the middle of the pitch like crazy and when Madrid get possession back he dribbles with his speed and skill through the opposition defense and lays it off to one of Ronaldo, Benzema, or Bale. I guess you could attribute him as the link that makes Madrid's transition from defense to offense so deadly and quick. 

Now, Willian and Di Maria are pretty similar players. Both have speed and skill as well as a beautiful shots and the most obvious, wingers who's main position is on the right. I'd say Willian has the edge defensively speaking but they both put in great shifts considering their position. The key difference between them in my opinion is their decision making and intelligence when it comes to counter attacking or any sort of play in the final third. Di Maria knows how to time his run, when to release, and who the best option is to release to. Not only does he know, but he executes it flawlessly a good majority of the time. Willian, not so much. It seems that he's always the one to slow down our attacks by dribbling to the corners or passing back. He's someone I simply wouldn't exactly call deadly on the counter. Not deadly when it comes to either passing, dribbling, opening up space with a dummy run, or finishing. Don't get me wrong, he's a great player who can and does bring fluidity to our movement of the ball but I don't see how he would fit in the pivot unless we change formations to have a third midfielder. Think about it. He performs best when we play possession football. You see him do one-twos with Matić and our defense all the time as he slowly distributes our team further and further up the pitch. That's what he's good at. When we're defending he drops back and chases tirelessly after the ball. If he improves on his decision making and vision then in the future I could see him being tried out but for now I think we would be left too exposed. If he was in charge of transitioning our attack (and let's face it, that's the main reason why we would play him there) right now, 5/10 times we would as quickly as we got the ball lose it and concede since our players would be trying to defend a counter while just seconds before countering themselves.

The combo of Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale is hard enough to contend with, but pair that with the form Modric and Di Maria are in and us with no Matic to lock them down is frightening. Luiz and Ramires could do a job but I think it would take the best performances of their careers. Id rather save them for the final. 

Atletico play too similar to our style just with more aggression and with the form they are on it would be the matchup Id be most nervous about. 

Bayern we have played against recently and were unlucky not to come out on top. It would allow us to play counter attacking to our fullest capabilities and we know what to expect from them. Not saying they would be anywhere close to the easiest option, but the one I think would favor us most.

Secondly, as pointed out above, their style of play suits our defensive strengths, Real and Atletico do not, and would quite possibly force us to play more defensive then we would like to. 

If **not** Bayern, then Real because Mourinho clearly had issues with some players in Madrid so surely he has a pretty clear idea of how to exploit them (i.e. Pepe, Ramos).

My sole aim and motivation is to able to make them into good human beings and teach them that hard work in the long run pays off. 

The essential subjects students need to be taught in my opinion are: Maths, English, Science and Philosophy. I think Philosophy should focus on morality and justice. This should be taught instead of critical thinking, which in my experience and talking to my friends, everyone regarded as a easy, not important, why even do it, laughable subject. It seemed so childish and unimportant in my view and I really didn't care. I also think there should be General Studies one a fortnight or so, where they teach about everyday finance, sex education, important laws etc. 

Of course this should be taught alongside other subjects like History, Geography, languages etc. Oh and also Programming C++, HTML5 or Java should be taught instead of ICT!! I'm pretty sure the subject ICT will become obsolete in the short future and Programming will become essential.

I really really do not think adopting an ""Asian Style"" of teaching is a good idea. Basically what this style promotes is just getting good grades with the sole purpose of using it as a signalling tool for getting into good universities and good jobs. There is absolutely no room for deviation from the curriculum, little to no creative thinking and just trying to produce robots that can do an exam well. This doesn't necessarily prepare them well for real life. What is the point of getting 100% in an exam when you have little common sense and cannot do your job that doesn't concern any theory?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ah good! No problem. Nobody tells you these things, uni's don't tell you anything and the BPA website makes it looks pretty simple but it's certainly not. The amount of people who do their 3 year undergrad then find out they're not a psychologist is shocking. 

Here's pretty much all the 'advice' I can give and again, it's a lot so sorry for the wall of text and sorry if I get presumptuous again. Hope it helps though.


How it works is at uni from 1st to 4th year, you're trained as a scientist. After that you continue can work as a researcher/do a phd, or you go and do the clinical path, so it splits off. Or you can go into HR/Marketing  etc. which majority of people do because they started psychology thinking they were going to be counselling someone over their dead dog and don't want to do stats. 

Generally you don't do both clinical and then research because a phd is 3 years, (7 years study) or a masters/doctorate is 3 years (7 years study). Plus to get into a phd you'll need a year or two work experience as a research assistant and as I said to do clinical it's same as an assistant psychologist. So that's a good 10-15 years before you settle down into a stable job. 

If that's what you want to do though, you would 100% do the research/phd path first, then apply for clinical path after because phd will help you getting accepted into clinical whilst if you do clinical it would be senseless to 'downgrade' to a research psychologist later. 

You can do clinical research without being a clinical psychologist though, like research into therapies, research into mental illness populations etc. It's far easier to do the research path than clinical. Or you can do clinical, and work as a casual academic - lecture at unis etc. I'm sure you've seen them ask in your classes who wants to do clinical and a good 20 people put their hands up, then who asks research and 2 put their hands up (everyone is terrified of statistics).

I've not a clue about NZ. I wouldn't bother about how respected a university is, the course is the same for honours everywhere and it's highly practical. You can be a great uni, but an dreadful psychology department (E.G USYD). What's going to matter is you get a good supervisor, work/volunteer experience and life experience, on top of a HD/1st degree. The degree to show you can work hard, the experience to show that you're right to be a psychologist.  

I can tell you what I did, which was time consuming, but it's worked.

- I did a BA, didn't get into any honours/4th year.

- Went travelling for a year, decided I still wanted to do clinical psychology but in the UK, did all this research and enrolled in a B.Psych degree in AU.

- Because I'd already done the BA, I just repeated 1 years worth of core subjects and was told I didn't have to repeat electives/first year subjects. I worked my arse off over the year and saved all my money  and got into an honours.

- Did honours which is a very difficult year. They do this to wipe out more people from applying for clinical, and worked as counsellor as there is no 'practitioner' training, even though the next step is get a job as an assistant practitioner where your 4 years uni is for the most part useless. Got my paper published.

- Moved to UK, had savings from AU etc, look for work as an assistant psychologist/RA. Most were impressed with the thesis/having two degrees/previous experience in the workforce/volunteer work/travel/my own personal experiences. Still not enough because you're competing for jobs against people who have had previous jobs as psych assistants and the jobs are few and far between.

- Did a UK masters in foundations of clinical and health psychology to bolster my resume and make some contacts in the profession. Also helps with doing the doctorate.

- Got an assistant psychologist job

- Keep working assistant/RA posts (you'll usually have to work in two jobs so you explore two areas and apply for doctorate every year until I get an interview.

A good way to think of it is if you want to permanently move to the UK to continue your study, especially doing a doctorate where they aren't going to accept you unless you're planning to stay and work in the NHS, what's 2 years extra in Australia to get free education and save money? If you get into an honours (apply every fucking uni there's 600 applications at each uni and 25 spots! You might have to move across Australia for it) 1 year is nothing in the long run.

Also something that is daunting is you might feel like you're falling behind your cohort etc. I was 23 when I did my honours and the youngest of the 25 students in the course. When I started I thought I'd be the oldest and I was 'behind' everyone and had to learn it's not a race. Nobody had directly come from their 3 year undergrad. Most students were in their late 20's early 30's and had 'life experience' of some sort so they'd already begun culling people for clinical. Even as an assistant psychologist, the average age is 28 even though you can start applying in the UK right out of undergrad (at around 21)


So on top of the good marks you have to be driven and have 'life experience' and be able to reflect on that experience and how you've grown. They look for things like travel, your own experiences in mental health, volunteer work (It's good to volunteer with lifeline/beyond blue/MIND charity in UK etc for a year during honours/undergrad to make yourself stand out and get that assistant psychologist job). 

It's cut throat and a big ask for a job that pays £22k a year but it's incredibly fulfilling and always interesting and by putting you through so much competitive shit at uni they're just secretly preparing you for the onslaught of more shit when you're in the profession.

Hope that's helped!",0,1397090256,null,0,1397090600,0,cgojw1c,t3_22lgb0,t1_cgojw1c,t1_cgo6f7c,null,1433287025,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,Macky_Hauser,null,null,"There are many reasons why he is one of the best who ever did it. But like a lot of people have said, his preparation is unmatched. He plans for everything. I think early in the season when he didn't rotate the squad that much and played the guys almost three times a week, was because he wanted to prepare them, for what it takes to win not only the league but the CL. I also think next year you will see a big difference when we play in the league cup and also the fa cup. But he plans for everything, i am sure that he has been planning for the semi-finals of the CL since last summer. Plus i think he has the Liverpool game all planned out as well, and what it will take for us to get all 3 points, and don't be surprised if Nando has a huge game. Because for all his talk about the strikers he knows they are old enough and strong enough to handle the pressure that he puts on them and also all the shit they get from all of us. ha! That is one of the reasons i think he sent Lukaku out on loan, because it will never be Lukaku's fault if Everton don't succeed. At Chelsea if he had a slump like he did in the middle of the season, people would be bashing the kid. So Mourinho does what he does best, he let the kid leave, and let him mature and learn. But you also see the response of our strikers as of late Eto'o having a great run of games, Nando's work rate, and Ba, who is a true professional and does what is asked of him with no fuss. 

So pigging backing off my fellow Blues, this is just another thing he does well, among a ton of other stuff.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Seems a fairly stupid policy. If someone is in arrears specifically because their property is too big, and assuming it is possible to find a property swap for them, why not change the policy to allow them to move?

The HA I was doing some oversight work for until last year were considering this. The policy was put in place to prevent people dodging debts, and before the spare room cap was implemented. My attitude was ""change the damn policy when it's clear they are in arrears specifically because of the cap, move them to a smaller property if you can and cut a deal on the debt"". However there are a few things the board raised. Firstly, the word ""damn"" was upsetting. Secondly, it's a long game. If the HA's keep this policy then it makes the impact of the bedroom tax more apparent, which will make it easier to repeal, and councils will just provide discretionary payments to cover the difference anyway. Thirdly, many people impacted are people who have been good tenants for years, look after their homes, pay on time and really consider the property to be their home rather than just a place they are living. It would be hard to uproot these people and stick them in shitty bedsits with drug addict neighbors and general population fuck ups without generating a huge amount of additional support requirements and ASB cases.  There is also the issue of not having enough properties of the right sizes, and the issue of people not having enough money or support to physically pack up their stuff and move houses. Lastly, I needed to re-read my Terms of Reference when it came to acceptable language.

&gt; The bedroom tax has good and bad aspects, imho, but if it forces HAs to re-assess their policy so that small families are encouraged to swap homes with larger families, that benefits everyone.

I thought it was a good idea to begin with, however I now hold the opinion that it's a giant cluster fuck. HA's and councils don't want to deal with it because the logistics is a nightmare, there aren't enough properties and it was implemented way too quickly for it to ever be successful. The government really needs to kill it asap, then rethink the implementation process. All they've done right now is just issued a pronouncement and wandered off to the next project. Done properly this could work, but this wasn't even half-assed properly.",0,1397091314,null,0,false,0,cgokcz7,t3_22mj1e,t1_cgokcz7,t1_cgogjdi,null,1433287246,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I will more than likely vote for them next month and next year. 

Unlike many will accuse me, I've read their policies and understand their beliefs. I don't agree with all of them by any means. But I'd be damned if anyone completely agreed with any party on everything. 

I am absolutely anti-EU for a plethora of reasons I won't go into. But that's the main reason.

However I also like their immigration and education policies among others.

I don't agree with their stance on gay marriage nor the environment, but to me they are not a priority. Therefore when looking at which party to vote for, that's quite far down the list. 

They're nationalistic yes, isolationist? Not by any means. 

Their policies aren't racist nor fascist or anything else.

I hope they can steal a few seats in 2015 and go into a coalition with the Tories. Put pressure on them to leave the EU and implement their better policies while the Conservatives can moderate their not so good policies (gay marriage and environmental for example).",0,1397092418,null,0,false,0,cgokujw,t3_22c70i,t1_cgokujw,t3_22c70i,null,1433287543,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

When I was looking for a new house with friends, they explained how much it would cost, we said that sounded fine. We looked around the house, it was poorly kept but poor students need cheap rent, we decided we'd take it. We went back to the agent and he drew up the contracts for us. 

Unlike my friends I had done the maths, to work out financing properly. When we came to sign the contract, I was the only person who read it properly and discovered that the rent was %60 higher per person than the agent said that very morning. I refused. When I asked the agent how the price had gone up by thousands since this morning, he said it was the gas bill.

TLDR: In the space of 4 hours estate agent tries to get us to sign a contract for a house, with wildly inflated prices since the first price. Claiming in the end to be the gas bill.

Why is the English league ""more physical"" or why is La Liga ""soft"". Part of it is the style of the players/teams, but part of the reason (and something that affects style) is how referees call the game. La Liga referees call things tighter, promoting more tricky dribbling and slighter players. Premier League referees allow more contact, promoting harder tackles and stronger shoulders. 

La Liga referees aren't ""right"" and Premier League referees ""wrong"" or vice versa, they're simply interpreting the (intentionally vague) laws of the game differently. Compared to most other sports, the rules of soccer give referees an immense amount of latitude. It is why, for example, advantage exists. The rules give referees the ability to use their judgement to determine whether it is advantageous or not to call a foul. Referees are given the responsibility of determining how much stoppage time to give, even though it would be quite easy to have an official clock that stops like in most other sports. 

Differences between individual referees is simply an extension of this. Given that the rules intentionally give referees power to decide some things rather than strictly applying a rule, and the acknowledged impossibility (at least until we get robot referees) of every single referee calling every single thing the exact same way, it follows that the proper way to judge a referee's ability is not what they call in a contextless universe, but rather whether they presided over a fair game. A fair game means treating the infractions of both teams equally. 

This kind of presentation, of all of the ""uncalled penalties"" presents a biased pictures that doesn't help you understand things better. Without including the context of how the game was officiated, anybody can cut any video to present any narrative about refereeing they prefer.

Jones described himself as ""nine out of 10 drunk"" and claimed not to recall the robbery.

But the shoulder strap snagged round the man's neck and despite his victim - who uses inhalers - gasping for breath, Jones refused to release his grip and dragged him off the scooter as it toppled over.

The 23-year-old, from Nuneaton, finally managed to untangle the bag's cord and fled.

But he returned to loiter around Coventry's Arena Park shopping centre car-park minutes later unaware that CCTV operators had caught the February 18 attack on camera, were monitoring his movements and had relayed details to Coventry Police officers.

Jones was charged with robbery, but claimed he couldn't remember anything about the incident and refused to accept the attacker caught on camera was him when shown the CCTV footage.

But he was picked out by both his victim and a supermarket security guard witness during an ID procedure - and at Coventry Crown Court he was jailed for a total of 40 months after admitting robbery.

From Wikipedia:
Within days of joining Manchester City, Balotelli was involved in a car crash.[141] It was reported that Balotelli was carrying £5,000 cash at the time – and that when a police officer asked why he had such a large sum of cash Balotelli replied: ""Because I am rich"".[142] Off-field activities involving Balotelli have included driving into a women's prison in Italy to ""have a look round"",[143] and throwing darts at a youth team player during a training ground 'prank'[144] – all of which have been confirmed to be true.""

As far as my understanding goes, and I may be wrong because I'm no expert - They pretty much used the Anglo Irish bank (who went along with the whole thing, right to the point of their downfall) as their own personal gambling ring which, when it all came tumbling down, left a lot of people's businesses and livelihoods ruined. 

The extreme leniency shown to them by the justice system, mainly due to the ""one rule for rich people, another for the rest of us,"" mixed with the great lawyers they had, funded (importantly) by their continued, hidden wealth (tens of millions of which were funneled off/laundered and remain unaccounted for - this is what the documentary specifically explores) is another factor that has contributed to the general hatred for them. 

They brought a lot of jobs to a forgotten part of the world, yes, but any good they did was far outweighed by the damage and suffering they caused. The fact they've pretty much gotten away with it and retained many millions is why people are so aggrieved. I can see why. I'd be pissed off too if an oligarch ruined my livelihood. 

As for the death threats mentioned in the article you posted, I wouldn't be surprised if Quinn was behind it himself. Nothing would surprise me about that guy anymore.

I understand your point of view, and yes it would be sad for Courtois, but here is why Chelsea won't, and absolutely shouldn't waive this clause should we draw Atletico. At the end of the day Chelsea FC is a business, and that business' revenue will greatly increase should we make the Champions League final, and even more so should we win it. From that standpoint alone I cannot see a scenario where we let Courtois play without Atletico paying.

Further, these clauses are **common** in international loans. Ever since Morientes knocked out Real Madrid when he was on loan at Monaco teams have been adding financial requirements for their loanees to play against them. This is not new. This is not unique to Chelsea. Atletico signed this loan deal knowing full well this was the case.

**Sentiments don't win championships**. No player is bigger than this team. Could this affect Courtois' view of Chelsea?

&gt; The ironic turn of phrase is ...

No really, explain what he meant.  You have described his wording as ""nuanced"" and ""ironic"".  I'm always up for an education in nuance and irony, so can you analyse what he said and show the irony?

This analysis may be different depending on what sort of irony you think was being deployed by Lord Tebbit.  Just to help you, I would imagine that you'd have a hard time demonstrating that it was Socratic irony, as I don't think he was actively engaged in a debate with anyone else at the time.  Dramatic perhaps?  Comic?  I don't want to lead you.

You might want to employ the following breakdown, to show the nuance and irony:

**The actual phrase used**

...


**The meaning that was intended to be conveyed**

...

**Identify the form of irony used, and explain it**

This isn't grasping at straws, this is just being precise about language.

&gt; No really, explain what he meant. 

What he said was: 

&gt; ""Mr McGuinness is there on the coat tails of the Irish ambassador – it's up to him whose company he chooses to keep. It makes it very difficult for the Palace and for the Lord Mayor. Mr McGuinness owns up to being a member of a terrorist organisation, those who suffered at the hands of the terrorists are not best pleased. The Queen no choice in matter; she can hardly refuse to invite the Irish ambassador. I imagine it is difficult for her – her family has suffered at the hands of the IRA. There's always the possibility that a member of the Real IRA will be so outraged by Mr McGuinness bowing to the Queen that they might shoot him in the back for it. We can but hope.""

The nuanced bit of the interview is the discussion around the feelings the Queen might have towards the situation and the diplomacy involved.

The ironic turn of phrase is the final two sentences. What he obviously meant by this is that as far as he, Tebbit (and perhaps also his disabled wife) were concerned, McGuinness, as a former member of a terrorist organisation, has no business at the palace and he Tebbit would not mind if McGuiness were to reap what he sowed. 

The irony used here [is that described in the second example in the Webster dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/irony).

Benitez always wanted the CB to bring the ball up the field, because the opponents hated it. The way it worked was that the opponents set up a box with the midfield and defenders to stop alonso, gerrard, torres and kuyt to get passes from the two LFC CB, with two strikers putting pressure on the CB with the ball (most often Agger). 

This worked pretty well, exept when Agger played. This is cause Agger waited for the striker to come at him, then took two or three huge steps up the field, leaving the strikers behind him. Boom, and suddely the opposition is defending with 9 men instead of 11. This is where they start to panic. One of the midfielders now have to put pressure on Agger, otherwise he will have a free lane and score blackburn style. Gerrard moves over behind him bringing CM nr2 with him. Now suddely alonso has all the space in the world, Torres looks for the pass behind the defenders. Liverpool had the perfect players to play like this 08/09..Agger the perfect CB for this.

[Here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24636682) is when it was first mentioned, then finally came into effect on [23/01/2014](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25847014). [Here](http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2014/01/checklist-when-taking-out-a-new-phone-or-broadband-contract/) is the official ofcom guidance. It states:

&gt; Under Ofcom guidance which applies to contracts for fixed minimum periods starting on or after 23 January 2014, if your provider increases the regular (usually monthly) subscription price (or prices, if you agreed that different prices apply at different times) beyond what you agreed to at the point of sale, it should:

&gt;(a) give you at least one month’s notice of any such price rise; and

&gt;(b) allow you to exit the contract without penalty if you choose to exercise that right.

&gt;**Price increases to services outside your agreed regular subscription price**

&gt;The guidance does not apply to any price increases for services outside of the regular subscription price. These could include international calls, calls to Directory Enquiries or premium rate numbers where you’re charged on a call by call basis and billed each month on top of your subscription.

&gt;However, your provider must still consider the application of Ofcom rules and general consumer law to any price increases for such services. **It must give you the opportunity to leave your contract if the proposed increase is likely to be of “material detriment”.**

&gt;If it does not do this and you think that the relevant price increase(s) will have a materially detrimental impact on you because of your circumstances, you should raise this with your provider and provide evidence to support your claim.

You could always run your own business part time on the side and when things are more established you could apply for a different type of visa or even citizenship.

You must understand that these rules are not there to persecute you but to stop benefit tourism.

A better example of that would be if the intended meaning was exactly the opposite.  This is one we're all familiar with.  Like ""Yeah, because driving while drunk is always such a good idea!"".

Making up something else and claiming that that's what he meant isn't great really, is it.  I could just as well say that the irony was that he really likes turnips.  See the irony?  He *said* ""we can but hope"" that the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland gets shot in the back by a terrorist organisation, but what he *meant* was ""turnips taste yummy!"".

However, the ""Islamic Threat"" is just a political scape goat and fear mongering tactic and nothing more. It's like communists in the US in the 50s. 

I deal with muslims every day. I went to school with muslims. I've been in muslim families houses for dinner. I buy goods of muslims in the shop on a daily basis. I get taxis by muslims regularly. I go to the muslim take away often. 

I have yet to experience outright homophobia on ANY level by any muslim in my life. 

Sexism and misogyny may go on, but the ones I know seem to treat their wives with a good bit of respect. 

The only person I have ever met who genuinely practiced Islam and prayed 5 times a day turned out to be the softest lad I've ever met. 

The only homophobia I have experienced has been from WHITE BRITISH MEN. 

Of course in places like Birmingham and Bradford it might be a lot different, but as far as I'm concerned the ""Islamic Threat"" is far beyond anything rooted in reality, and I see people who fall for these political tactics as no different to Germans in the 30s with Jews. 

Yes, there are parts of Islam that are not compatible with our values like the fundamentalist family who tried to kidnap their daughters lesbian lover because of ""Family Honor""; but ya know what happens when someone does something like that which *isn't* compatible with our values and laws? They throw them in JAIL. 

That's the only time you hear about the ""Islamic Threat"" though really, isn't it? The news. 

Have you noticed anti-islam sentiment seems to have flourished over the past few years? Why do you think that is? It's because the news likes to stir up a frenzy. 

The fear in your head is projected into you by flashing screens to the point you start to look at the muslim man across the street differently even though you've known him your whole life and he hasn't actually changed, but because your brain is being warped by flashing screens constantly telling you to be afraid of the evil muslim man across the street you can't help but be brainwshed into irrational fear and hatred.

Most of your exposure to muslims comes from the fear mongering news and flashing screens telling you to be afraid of them and hate them for their wicked ways, as apposed to going outside and talking to actual muslims.

And perhaps if the person who made the statement hadn't been the victim of a terrorist attack and spent the rest of their live caring for their spouse who was disabled in the attack, then the reaction might be different again. I expect most people would take these things into consideration.

Anyway, this is a stawman. I'm not really saying Tebbit should/should not have said what he did or whether or not what he said is reprehensible. I'm simply saying that he hasn't called for anyone to be killed (which was your earlier point).",0,1397124209,null,0,false,0,cgouatc,t3_22lltv,t1_cgouatc,t1_cgou7uf,null,1433292064,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You are so blinded by your rage that you are actually saying the UK visa system exists solely to split up families!! Have a think about what you are saying.

What will help is accepting that this is the way things are right now and working with the system. You have to be honest with yourselves, what are your real options? What options do you have, where you both meet the requirements? Immigration is not somewhere where the rules are bent for your being a top-notch person, they are hard and they ain't changing for you.

Big Pharma is driven by profit, as is any other industry.

On the other hand, government subsidy for research, or even a new public-funded drug company, sits very uncomfortably with anyone with notions towards small government and minimising state influence on every day life. As mentioned above, Equilibrium had some interesting points.

true,tastesliketurtles,1953,Chopper Harris,"Depends on your definition of quality.

I just don't see what the this is trying to get at. A big part of what made the 4-3-3 so successful was Drogba, Duff and Robben. A 'big man' striker with two natural wingers feeding him from the outside. We are no longer gifted with Didier and old school wingers like Duff appear to be nearly extinct in modern football. The 4-3-3 worked so beautifully because Jose introduced it during the days in which 4-4-2 was the formation of choice. Defending such a flat midfield was a dream for Makelele, and behind him was possibly the best back four ever. On the counterattack we then had Duph/Robben/Cole to stretch the back four and then the ball could either be crossed into Drogba or passed into the path of players like Lampard making a late run into the unoccupied space that 4-4-2 left between the midfielders and back four. 

Football has changed. So have the formations and the roles of each position, none more so than that of a midfielder. Since the days of Claude Makelele, the defensive midfielder position has become more of a necessity than an option for managers. Players in this position add a layer of protection in front of the back four, eliminate the space between defense and midfield as well as provide the late run that Lampard trademarked in his glory days. Their counterparts further up the field in the attacking midfield or 'number 10 role' are also extremely popular in the modern game. Taking advantage of any space between the midfield and back four, feeding the striker and scoring quite a few themselves makes it an extremely desirable position to be filled by fast, creative players. The AM role is a big reason why having a double pivot has become so popular. It is not uncommon to see multiple players attacking the space between defense and midfield, and while Makelele was amazing, he too would probably have difficulties dealing with players like Hazard, Mata, Silva etc. who now occupy the AM position. This is why a 4-3-3 would not be the best formation in todays football, especially considering the fact that the mid-table teams have gotten considerably better since Jose was first in charge. 

My proof of that would be Liverpool, who often employ a 4-3-3. Yes, they are top of the league, but they are being propped up by two strikers in the form of their lives, and they are extremely fortunate for that. They have conceded a whopping 40 goals this season, more than any of the top 5 aside from Arsenal who have conceded the same amount, more than Man United, even more than Crystal Palace. If you watch them play, there is so much space when a team is on the counter, and often times they concede multiple times. They are just extremely lucky to be able to lean on Suarez and Sturridge to out score the opposition, being that both are in the form of their lives. I know it's an odd comparison, but I would bet anything that even in the event of Liverpool winning the title, baring some serious investment during the summer, there is little chance of them maintaining the success. The point of this is that I don't think the 4-3-3 is defensively viable any more. The one thing that pissed me off most about this article and probably sent me into this long rant was the fact that the columnist suggested that it would be better to switch back to the 4-3-3, which would imply moving Hazard and Willian out of their natural positions into the wings and then act like Torres or Eto'o are the kind of strikers that can thrive on crosses. Using Ba is conceivable in this kind of setup, but I seriously doubt he can offer us even close to what Drogba did.

I'm certainly not trying to act like we aren't suffering from a lack of scoring, because we definitely are. But I can't stand how this guy seems to be so sure that a change of formation would make Torres or Ba a prolific striker and thus score more goals. The one simple thing to remember is that you build your squad around a system, and our system is well oiled in the defensive aspect, what we're lacking most is a capable striker. The argument that 4-2-3-1 is what holds us back is complete and total bollocks and if you want proof of that, look at Manchester City. They use the same formation, and three of their four top scorers in the league are strikers, with 20+ goals each.

There is more I could rant about here but I won't. All I will say is that it is preposterous that the midfield trio we have 'clogs up' the midfield and thus somehow, through some kind of magic, results in our strikers scoring less goals. The truth of the matter is we need a capable striker who actually has the capacity to operate off of the support of some world class attacking midfielders.

Edit: I also really hate the fact that this 'columnist' implies that it is embarrassing to use a double pivot against sides who are lower in the league. Nowadays every top side has a few losses to the likes of Villa, West Brom etc. Mid table and lower teams don't really lay down to the likes of Chelsea and United like they used to. They fight and sometimes knick a point, and other times even win.

true,Rynoh,null,null,"There isn't really much difference in what we do and what this article calls for.  

A 4-2-3-1 is designed to have a pivot.  That means when one player makes a run forward the other slides slightly deeper and fulfills the holding role until his partner returns.  It is designed to allow either player to get forward with cover.  Playing a Matic/Ramires pivot allows either to get forward without restricting their offensive abilities.  A 4-3-3 with Matic holding restricts his creative ability and stifles fluidity making us more predictable and easier to mark.  

As far as congestion goes that isn't going to be fixed with a 4-3-3 either.  It isn't like Hazard, Oscar or Willian don't hang out by the touch line.  Right now our strategy is to have them cut in, interact with the striker and each other to create confusion and develop passing lanes or shooting opportunities. We can have them hang out on the wing in more rigid positioning but we don't have a target man to ping crosses to or to hold up play.  

The article claims these forwards haven't forgotten how to score but Torres never recovered his speed after the knee injury and Chelsea aren't afforded the space to run into that these strikers had at previous clubs.

Pochettino actually scares me in that i think he could be AVB mk2.  He has Southampton playing great football, and it is nice to watch. But he is also a ""system"" guy and he got sacked at Espanyol when he got his long term contract and started clearing out players that didn't fit the ""system"", the same system he runs at Southampton. At Espanyol he left after he lost the locker room and the stands from in part being unbending in his belief that the system would work.  Sounds all too familiar for me. Just like AVB he could go on to be a fantastic coach but that rigid adherence to a ""system"" concerns me.;

I can't see Klinsmann leaving the USMNT, he has been given the keys to the kingdom, is well paid, likes living in the states (he has had a home in LA for years before taking the job and i believe he is married to a woman who is from the states) and has the rare alignment of being a national team coach with realistic goals.  As long as things are improving with the US program he won't catch flack.

I don't want Laudrop. I think he is prone to get bored of his projects, i could see him doing well with us for a season and then wonder why PSG or Real haven't offered him the gig and let everything go to shit.

Ancelotti would be fantastic, don't see Real sacking him even with the down season. But he would be the perfect fit.  I am actually pretty sure that when he was unemployed and Harry was on trial for his dogs tax returns that we were lining him up to be the replacement if Harry got convicted, then by the time that the season ended and Harry was sacked he was employed by PSG.

Think back to Stevie adjusting to the deeper role. 3 or 4 games he was given of 6/10 performances until he was able to play it well. Likewise Hendo over last season.

My theory is that you can't improve younger players from the bench, they need to play, make mistakes and feel trusted regardless. Training cannot replicate this.

I would think that a better strategy is to play the younger players and have old hands on the bench - Toure, Kuyt, Eto, etc etc. 

If you are not good enough to start, I think the younger players should be loaned, as otherwise progress will slow.

&gt;So basically they have tax credits of £150m. They have to report that as an asset on the balance sheet but it basically means they are exempt from £150m worth of tax. Seeing as how football clubs almost never make enough money to pay much tax it is not worth much at all.
I work in finance but i'm not an accountant so i can't explain the nitty gritty but basically no it is not cash they have made.
Posts like these annoy me because without context there will be a whole lot of people thinking United made £150m. They certainly did not, in fact they actually lost money.

More game time I expect  

* *In what defensive setup (players and formation) does he fit best?*  
He strikes me as best in the centre but adequate at left back. I think a utility player is useful so it'd be great if he could retain that whilst getting stronger  

* *As a regular at the age of 22, do you consider inexperience to still be an excuse for frequent mistakes?*
We have plenty of young players out on loan and not as many as I'd like pushing for the first team, so I am happy that he is involved. Mistakes are to be expected from young players so no issues there.

Knowing Villa he'll get sold for nothing, go to a team that play him regularly and he'll eventually get bought by a top team and become an England regular.

Honestly the biggest indicator for me is no one from the club (like Ayre, as an example) has said that they believed we were compliant.  If you look at City/Chelsea as examples, they both released public statements where they said they were compliant which means they must feel pretty strongly that the math works out in their favor.

First thing's first though and we need to make it back into the CL again next season, then worry about the implications of FFP.

When Ade wants to work he is fantastic whereas we he doesn't want to work he is a waste of talent and time and if LvG is capable of getting Ade to buy into what he is preaching then i think Ade could be very successful. On the other hand, if Ade doesn't buy into the philosohy/culture/attitude i don't see LvG even trying to deal with him, i think he would just ship him out and move on without a second thought. You either buy into what LvG preaches and you work or you are surplus to the club.....in truth, i think it is less about how LvG would handle Ade and more about how Ade would react to a manger like LvG.

I would hope that AVB's decision to freeze Ade out served as a wakeup call that, in truth, he has needed for years.  This is a tremendously talented player. But if he had the work ethic and personality to match his considerable talent he would never have ended up with Spurs.  He would either still be with City or he would be at Real.  He would be the £30m striker that people talk about moving between the big boys.  Luckily for us his attitude issues and work ethic are perceived in a manner that the big boys don't even want to bother with him.

Also keep in mind with Ade that it has been said tht effectively City's subsidizing of his salary goes away after this season if i am not mistaken.  Meaning that Ade's salary jumps by a considerable amount (rumoured to jump into the £125k - £150k/wk range). That would make Ade very expensive and 30 years old which is a fairly bad combination with someone like Levy.

There have been some recent games where we have had trouble unlocking defenses when we don't completely overwhelm teams early with our pressing/quick counter combination. We have managed to get full points thanks to individual brilliance of SAS and some other players, especially winning penalties. Might it be useful to train in a similar way as the way you outlined above to create a ""Plan B"" so to speak if we find ourselves unable to break down the defense after 60 minutes or whatever (esp. over the summer for next season), or do you think that would be too much distraction/noise instead of focusing on perfecting the system Rodgers has implemented this year?

Brendan does not want the CB to start the offensive play, he wants Gerrard or Lucas. The advantage with dropping the CDM, as Barca and Arsenal also do is that the defence have a harder time putting pressure on the ball when Agger and Skrtel is behind Gerrard as alternatives. Gerrard is the team quarterback, if no one is open forward he takes the easy ""checkdown pass"" to the centerbacks, takes new position and try again.  In 08/09 we had 1 striker, and one monster CAM. We needed the CBs to start the play to get more payers up the field. With all the weapons we have now we don't need that. 

I believe that you need to have a plan B to go all the way in the PL. It's to easy for teams to prepare to stop you. You know someone who never, ever has had a plan B? Arsene Wenger. Now there is a few teams in history that has managed without a plan B, Guardiolas Barcelona and Wengers invincible Arsenal for example..

true,[deleted],null,null,"Is Baker good enough for Villa? Depends on how you classify Villa. A team that wants top half? Not at the moment.

Has he improved since he became a regular? Yes.

How can he further improve? Positioning. Marking. Concentration. Distribution. Also **heading in the opposition box!** Every bloody game him or Clark get a relatively easy header and plant it wide or over. Baker is huge and gets his head to the ball often. He should be getting 3 or 4 goals a season off set pieces.


In what defensive setup does he fit best? Clearly CB alongside Vlaar in 4-4-2. He's a standard no nonsense left centre back. Not a left back. Not a sweeper.


Do you consider inexperience an excuse? Yes. Completely. He's only had 2 seasons playing regularly, and he has spent much of that time at left back, with similarly inexperienced players around him and an inexperienced midfield in front of him. It's tough for him to develop like that.


What do you think will happen? Baker will have to improve a lot to prove he is good enough to be a premier league regular. I think we'll keep him at least another couple of seasons and hopefully he can develop well.


Baker is far from a lost cause for me. He will never be an international or champions league calibre player because his technique and passing aren't up to it, but he could certainly be a starting centre back for a top half premier league club if he develops well from here.

No, not currently. His biggest strength is flinging himself at last minute blocks, often due to a poor decision he made. That's not the sign of a decent Premier League player. Ideally, he'd be on loan to a Championship side.

&gt;* *Has he improved since he became a regular?*
Yes, but he's still not top flight class.

&gt;* *How can he further improve?*
He needs to think through what he's doing and understand positional play better. I don't think Lambert has shown any indication that he or his staff can improve this with the younger players.

&gt;* *In what defensive setup (players and formation) does he fit best?*  
He needs a better class of player around him, Vlaar is great for this. Kinda reminds me of Curtis Davies for that.

&gt;* *As a regular at the age of 22, do you consider inexperience to still be an excuse for frequent mistakes?*
Partly, though some of the errors he's made should have been coached out of him by now. 

To be fair to him, the managerial turnover hasn't helped in this regard.

For starters I think you'd need a rather more traumatising experience than burning your hand or whatever.

Most people suffer a broken bone or some kind of semi-significant trauma to their bodies when growing up, are we going to turn around and say that these traumas *significantly* affected their personality in all cases? 

Also, just to bring this back on point, we're talking about *dogs* here, not people. I love dogs and acknowledge that they have distinct personalities to a degree, but hardly to the same extent as people, at least not as far as human perception can detect. Their personalities by and large are predicated upon their pack animal nature and centuries of breeding for certain traits, which is why we find them such affable companions. There are also variations between breeds and individuals to a lesser extent, and being neutered can also affect this. In this particular case we're talking about two dogs raised by the same person, who is by the law of averages probably a middle-class person in a particular kind of stable environment. The dog's life will consist of a training regime when it's young, a couple of walks a day, being petted, chilling out and being fed. Maybe something extreme could happen, most probably not though.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Keep in mind that Ramos was not a great coach and Comoli has proven not only with us but with LFC that he is shit as a DoF.

To say the team is in the situation because Baldini signed players is ignoring the issues that AVB had on the field (not to mention off he field with seemingly the rest of the entire club). AVB wanted a DoF, we got him the DoF he specifically wanted, once he was sacked he complained that he didn't get the players he needed/wanted. Yet 2 of the major players he wanted Willian and David Villa we made approaches for and after touring the facilities and meeting with AVB they decided to pass on the club and go elsewhere. As replacement for those two we brought in Eriksen/Soldado (and Soldado was one of the players that AVB gave the ok on), that's not a bad compromise.

Maybe the situation we have with the club at the moment is because AVB's tactics and unbending adherence to his system didn't work and we followed that up by appointing an unqualified novice with no grasp of tactics or squad selection to manage the team.

To say that the DoF system won't work in England is ridiculous, it is widely used with success in Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, Holland, Brazil not to mention (considering that the DoF is essentially a GM) the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the NHL.  The PL is big and involves a great deal of money but to say that a system that works not only in other countries but other sports (incidentally which also involve massive amounts of money) can't work in England is naive.

Redknapp deserves credit for what he accomplished, but in many ways his success was lightning in a bottle.  He landed at Spurs with the perfect combination of players and timing. He landed with a team that had an emerging Luka Modric and Gareth Bale (incidentally both arrived before Harry) and then picked up VdV (a gift from Levy) and coincided with LFC going into a 4 year down period and City only starting its accession to the top. What Harry did for us was fantastic but to say that is the only manner that will work is short sighted.

When you say ""this"" do you mean widespread corruption and abuse of power? Because there are plenty of examples of ""Bobbies on the beat"" being involved in all kinds of activities.

Also, neither of those polls revealed their methodology. This is pure speculation, but I suspect that Londoners, Liverpudlians, ethnic minorities, Muslims are much more likely to distrust the Police. 

And, there is evidence to show that since the 60s, trust in the police has shrunk by 20% using figures from a [Royal Commission report (referred to in this article)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26730705). 

Either way, roughly 1/3 of the population do not trust the people who are supposed to be policing by consent. [Peel's 9 principles](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26730705) look laughable in the context of news reports in recent years. 

Your answers basically sum up the attitude of the Police in general to a stream of shocking stories. Which is a shame, because it means that the ""bad apples"" really do poison the barrel. 

You deserve better as a member of the force and we deserve better as citizens.

EDIT: And what do you think about the measures that I suggested in my previous post. Namely: 

Having a Police regulator that wasn't staffed by the people it was investigating.
Longer sentences for convicted police staff.

Atletico without Courtois is a comfortable win in our book. And Bayern is no where near as deadly as last season. 7-0 aggregate on Barca compared to a 4-2 agg with one of the worst ManU teams in recent history.

 Pep has turned them into a possession focused team that while still is one of the best teams in the world, allows chances. Last year they shut out Messi and a fairly good Barca. This year they struggled to control Welbeck  and with a bit of luck/not freaking out when they scored, United beats them. With Bayern, we draw in Germany, then win with Eto up top at home. Mourinho will out manage Pep, again, and Chelsea will crush Pep's fragile confidence, again.

It's one thing to make CL this coming year which looks pretty likely at this point, but it's another thing entirely to do it in a sustainable fashion.  That said, our form has been very good since the additions of Sturridge/Coutinho so if we can keep it up (and at this point it's been too long to have been a complete fluke) I suspect we'll be alright.  Additional depth and quality won't hurt, but for me I'd focus on the league again next year and let the CL chips fall where they may.  Even just participating in the group stage is worth a shed ton of money to the club so it's more imperative that we (for me) do well in the league and fall short of making it past the group then say making it to the semis and fall short of CL the following season, if that makes sense.

Chelsea will definitely be spending in the summer as it looks they may be moving on all 3 of their strikers, United is clearly in need of something, Arsenal looks set to spend a fair amount.  

Thoughts on City though since you're a supporter?

As to your last point, I don't anticipate us making any blockbuster moves this summer, maybe a decent fullback who can come in and compete and provide depth, so I think our potential really comes down to further development of the players we have already. To that end, a number of players have made huge strides already this season.

I do think City and Chelsea are changing the way they perhaps do things a bit.  Chelsea seem to have gone with the 'buy all the best young players in world football and send them on loan' approach which frankly makes a lot of sense if you can pull it off.  They get to keep the best of them (the Courtois's if you will) and sell the others at a tidy profit (De Bruyne) which allows further investment using the gain.  Zouma is another one they sort of quietly picked up this year.  Frankly, this approach makes me more nervous then their historic big buys as over the long term it's going to make them very, very strong.

As for City, they seem to finally have what I would consider a very good squad with a fair amount of depth themselves.  Commercially they're coming along nicely and they are massively investing in youth and bringing in the likes of Txiki/Borrell/etc means they probably intend on having a world class youth academy moving forward.  I suspect they won't spend nearly as much net moving forward as they may have in the past as they move to a more mature business model.

United are still a juggernaut financially, but thankfully their owners are awful.

One issue is the building trade, and its not that foreign builders are better, its that trade work is not minimum wage, and foreign workers can undercut or work for less, as they often are in this country on their own, sending money home, and sharing living space with several other foreign workers to save money. Their living costs are very low compared to a British builder who may be trying to support his family here. Trade workers have seen their income cut by up to 40% in some areas.

Many Polish builders who have brought their family's to try and settle in this country have been struggling to find work recently as they themselves are being undercut in the same way.

In particular, they made it so that political legitimacy in the lands supposedly promised by God to the children of Abraham always belonged to those who *came to it from elsewhere*.

I think he is wrong that Liverpool is just a flash in the pan because I think that our fan base is large enough to temporarily keep up and we are historically one of those top 4 everyone is trying to catch.  I found some TV ratings from 2011 (which is a huge deal for commercial deals) and the Liverpool vs Man U game that year had 500 million viewers worldwide.  The champions league final that year only had 300 million.  The world cup final was 700 million.  The reason that LP can attract commercial sponsors is because of this.  In fact, I'm willing to bet right now that THIS weekend's match against Man City will be one of the highest viewed sports events ever.  Given our relative positions, our style of play, and the fact that we are the only game on at that time means we should be a massive draw.

Recycle and you will have almost no rubbish. I have friends who are amazing at this and they've inspired me to work at it. Think twice before you buy fast food or coffee with disposable containers. Anything that you use once and then goes in a bin is a complete waste. You use it once and it goes in a landfill forever? How is that not the most insane thing ever?

* Take 5 minutes to make a morning coffee, or a packed lunch and bring it to work. 
* If you have to have a Starbucks coffee in the morning ask for a regular cup. If you need it to-go because you're a super busy commuter then why didn't you just get up 10 minutes earlier and have a coffee at home?
* Buy more basic food ingredients with less packaging.
* Use the food waste bins


Take a trip out to Dalmahoy Hill. It's a beautiful little hill next to the old RAF base. There's an old landfill there that's been filled over. There are tubes in the ground to release the gases and warnings all over the place of the dangers of possible explosions. That's the reality of where our rubbish is going. That's how landfills have to be managed once they're filled.

In addition to that, even if the council were amazing at their job that rubbish has to go somewhere. Most landfills are sealed with only clay and a thin plastic sheet which has now been discovered to leak. Landfills are poisoning the next generation's water supply.

To the OP, did you really need to buy a disposable cup of coffee or could you have waited till you got home for coffee?

This isn't by luck though, we spent a long time looking for the right dog, talking to the people at shelters, meeting her before we adopted etc. That's what I think they meant, by adopting an adult dog you can see their temperament as it is, and speak to the staff that have gotten to know them. That's a better indicator of what they're going to be like when you get them home than their genetics. Of course there are dogs with personality problems in shelters, but you don't have to take those dogs, there are still plenty that end up in shelters for various reasons but have no personality problems.


I'm sure you that if you have raised one dog from a puppy, you could raise another a similar way. I think it's also likely you'd give it special treatment because it reminds you of the beloved pet it was cloned from, and you'd end up with a more spoilt and badly behaved dog. Either way, it's never going to have the same quirks, like and fear exactly the same things, have the same habits etc. The truth is you are never replicate your favourite dog exactly or anywhere near, which is the whole point of cloning in the first place. On the other hand if you are just looking for a dog with a similar temperament, you can get one a lot cheaper than £60k.

The first player walks up, hulking, massive, breathing heavily. It's Steven Gerrard, and my god, the jersey! It’s a coat of flames, with a Carlsberg logo, burning brightly, and as the skipper raises his hands to the sky, a flaming Liverbird erupts out the back and shoots into the sky with an enormous screech! Unbelievable! Behind him, in a flying V formation walk Ivan Rakitic, Fernando Reges, and Luke Shaw! They’ve all signed 10 year pre contracts! The glory!

That's not accurate - apart from Westminster, all EU elections use the [Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) system.

Briefly: You have a single vote in a constituency with multiple seats to fill (in the case of NI's European elections, 3 MEPs). You rank the candidates you would like to give your vote to in order of preference, including as many or as few as you like. 

Initially, everyone is ranked by first choice votes. If anyone has at least a quota (the number of votes needed to secure a seat, which is 25%+1 of the total votes cast in a 3-seat constituency), they are elected, and their excess votes are redistributed to their second preferences (that is, all those above the 25%+1 needed for the seat). If nobody has a quota, the last-ranked person is eliminated, and all of their votes are redistributed to other candidates according to their second preference.

This process is repeated until all of the seats are filled, and has the potential to give rather different results than a simpler multiple-vote approach, as fractional transfers can often prove important.",0,1397149475,null,0,false,0,cgp2ng8,t3_22mj24,t1_cgp2ng8,t1_cgogh9i,null,1433296065,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

However:

No employee can be treated unfavourably, so if 'some of you' are working them all and others aren't, you would have a case for grievance. Also, if you booked holiday and incurred costs you can kick off about that, too. 

Don't bother looking in your contract pack and trying to derive what is right and wrong from there, an employment contract is about much more than the stuff written in black and white. There are implied terms and all sorts else. 

Speak to your union rep and if you don't have one, that's why this sort of thing is happening. Get one. Free legal advice comes with membership and I can assure you that no HR department I have ever worked with is well versed in how the law works, let alone the letter of it. HR are not there to ensure you get treated fairly, they are there to ensure the richest people in your company don't get in trouble. They are not your friends and will not be looking out for your best interests.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Keep in mind that Ramos was not a great coach and Comoli has proven not only with us but with LFC that he is shit as a DoF.

Who hired them?

&gt; To say that the DoF system won't work in England is ridiculous, it is widely used with success in Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, Holland, Brazil not to mention (considering that the DoF is essentially a GM) the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the NHL.

If it's ridiculous to say DoF doesn't work in England and then why do your examples of its success not include English clubs? It has been tried many times and never worked. Once you put a DoF in place it undermines the manager and affects his ability to control the dressing room and do his job effectively. This might not be an issue in other countries but it clearly is in the UK.

&gt; If you choose the right personnel to put a DoF system in place it will work. But you have to get all the parts correct, we as you said are horrible at choosing managers which causes massive issues and would cause massive issues whether there was a DoF or not.

If it is going to work then as you say it's massively important to make excellent appointments. This is something that is clearly beyond Levy. A DoF system is doomed under Levy because he'll never put the right people in place. If Levy is going to stick around he needs to hire a manager and let him run the show like he did with Redknapp. That way we have a chance.

&gt; Redknapp deserves credit for what he accomplished, but in many ways his success was lightning in a bottle. He landed at Spurs with the perfect combination of players and timing. He landed with a team that had an emerging Luka Modric and Gareth Bale (incidentally both arrived before Harry) and then picked up VdV (a gift from Levy) and coincided with LFC going into a 4 year down period and City only starting its accession to the top. What Harry did for us was fantastic but to say that is the only manner that will work is short sighted.

You can play down Redknapp's achievements all you like and put it down to good fortune.

Certain people/items/debts/companies are riskier than others to invest in. What does that mean? It means there's a greater chance that they will not repay/be able to repay their debt. As a result, if you choose to invest in something which has higher risk, you also expect a higher rate of return.

An A-rated debt (whether company or individual) has a minimal chance of not being repaid. As a result, the interest paid on it will be absolutely minimal, usually. You can hold hundreds, thousands of different debts (mortgages, company bonds etc) rated A+ with virtually no chance of losing your money. You're never going to make much money off them though.

A junk-rated debt does actually have some chance of defaulting/not being repaid on time. If you hold 1,000 of them, odds are that at least 1pc will default (and if something major changes, like energy costs or the cost of credit) then a great many more may default. As a result you need to be receiving higher interest payments from the rest of them to compensate for the losses you make on a few of them.


At the end of the day there are some very fiscally irresponsible people. It is a shame, and all efforts should be made to improve their money-handling. 'Payday lending' and overdrafts are both expensive because there is a lot of risk involved with lending to people like that.

Even with an overdraft, if the bank does not regain access to the money it has lent you when it expects to then it is (by definition) suffering a loss because it cannot then put that money to use elsewhere. Hence the hefty interest rates, which are also slightly punitive to encourage people not to abuse their overdraft facility.

Ultimately people need to understand that borrowing money will, for most people, lose them more money and happiness than they will gain (unless it is for an investment like a business or mortgage). You have to stop the spiral of debt early, before you regularly find yourself thousands of dollars in the red.",0,1397149972,null,0,false,0,cgp2w4f,t3_22oj5d,t1_cgp2w4f,t1_cgoz25a,null,1433296179,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

So I can definitely see Leeds being sold for 100+ in a few years if we perform well and hold a couple of seasons in the PL.

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"Call Shelter's Housing Advice Line: 0808 800 4444 (8am til 8pm). 

By law your landlord must have put your deposit into a deposit protection scheme within 30 days of you signing the lease (they send you a certificate), if s/he didn't you can take them to the small claims court and get up to three times the amount of your deposit awarded back to you. If s/he did you can use the relevant scheme's arbitration process to settle on an amount to be deducted. The adjudicator's decision is final (although you can still take them to court if you don't agree) so get your dates straight and your evidence together.

It's no good the agent telling you on departure that 'all that needs doing is a patch of paint on the wall and the oven cleaning', the agent should be providing you with a check-out inventory and that they have not will be frowned upon. It's the landlord's responsibility to prove that any works needed doing as a result of your tenure, and that does NOT include wear and tear; they may have to provide evidence of getting competitive quotes for the works and provide a receipt for the works having taken place. 

Shelter are really, really really good with this sort of thing, so do take the time to call them.

**What you need to do right now though** is contact your landlord straight away saying 'dear landlord, I agree a deduction of up to £50 for the cleaning of the oven if you can provide the relevant proof of payment to the cleaner, otherwise I would like my deposit of £pounds returned to me within 10 calendar days please, as the remainder of your stated deductions fall under the definition of wear and tear as stated in the lease.' It's important to put the amount you're expecting returned to you in there and that you want a response within that time period, because that's the period these arbitrators allow landlords to have to reply to you after you have formally stated to your landlord that you want x of your money back, dispute it with you or simply ignore you. Then you can instigate their formal process and/or take them to court if you wish. 

If s/he didn't use the deposit protection scheme you may wish to pick up the phone and suggest that, as s/he has broken the law, if this isn't sorted in a timely manner, you'll be taking him to court, and a court could award x3 the amount of the deposit, the £80 small claims court legal fee, plus reasonable expenses such as the cost of you taking a day off work to attend court if it's required. 

This is how the process runs in short: 

- Send landlord email asking for x amount to be returned to you, and ask for a response within 10 days (I would suggest adding in the time this has already taken in your email as it will strengthen your case with an arbitrator or court)

- If no response, by day 14 you may lodge an official dispute via the protection scheme stating whether you wish to use their service or go to court

- They will not allow you to start this until you've made reasonable attempts to negotiate with the landlord

- If the process fails due to lack of evidence or whatever, you can then still take them to the small claims court

Edit: the arbitration process via the three deposit protection schemes **is free**. But as I said, their decision is final, you can't dispute it once both parties have provided their evidence (but you can still go to court).

It's important to note that not all of your preferences may have an effect - obviously if you vote for a party which stays in the race for a long time, preferences for parties which are eliminated before them won't be reflected. 

Wearing my cynical hat, I suspect none of the listed parties really have a chance of getting in - between them, the greens and the alliance were barely a third of a quota last election. Among those parties, it's usually first preference votes which are taken as a marker of support, and the limited transfers they see are usually neglected.

Having said that - I would consider making sure you rank the front-running parties somewhere on your list, even if you vote for smaller parties first. You don't lose anything in doing so, and given demographic drift in NI in recent times it's just possible the third seat may actually be competative this year, so it wouldn't hurt to have your opinion reflected there.",0,1397150862,null,0,false,0,cgp3bog,t3_22mj24,t1_cgp3bog,t1_cgohb27,null,1433296383,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6
