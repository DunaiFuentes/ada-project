true,whatatwit,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; It's fine if you have medical insurance and a decent job.
&gt; 
&gt; You wouldn't even see the costs. 

I'm afraid that that's not right.  I was moved by a giant tech company to the Bay Area and expected it to be a bit like BUPA but no - you get to see every glorious line item.  That's because the insurance wants to tell you line by line in their euphamistically called [Explanation of Benefits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation_of_Benefits) what they won't pay for and why.  By the way it comes as a secure pdf not in an online website. They have all sorts of ways of not paying like:

* Exceeds reasonable, usual and customary - which they just make up

* Item Not Covered - which means it doesn't even count towards your max deductible!

* Exeeds limit for your plan, etc.

In theory you can appeal but when you have hundreds of these lines say from a hospitalisation and you are looking after a family member in a crisis it is almost impossible.
When you do appeal to the insurance you are met with mainframe like systems, voice activated phone systems, and eventually people in Indian call centres measured on how much they deny.  It really is a lot like dealing with an old-fashioned telecom company that does not genuinely need to compete and you can't get anywhere.

If you complain to your employer you find personnel is outsourced and employee benefits further outsourced with pretty much the same lack of knowledge or interest in fixing the problem.

I could tell you more but I have to go look after the family members concerned. The whole system is closed, defective and corrupt.

You seem to be spoiling for a fight.

I'm pointing out the folly of your words. You go on to talk about teachers seizing phones. What has that got to do with, and I must quote you again as it seem you're unaware of your own words, ""pointing out some uncomfortable truths about the perpetrators""? You're saying some teachers are being negligent of their jobs...you *know* this for a fact, you say. So you're saying *you* are personally aware of people passing round rape on phones and a teacher who has ignored it. Where did this take place? What haven't *you* contacted the police? IF you did what was the outcome?

I'm not saying *you* have been copy pasting Stormfront stats around, I was citig an extreme case of ""pointing out some uncomfortable truths"" that you believe will solve the problem. Up until now you've *still* been unable to tell me how it helps. You've simply described what decent police and good teachers *should* be doing in your eyes, which to my knowledge the vast majority already do. So again, in terms of ""pointing out some uncomfortable truths about the perpetrators"" what is it you believe isn't being done?

&gt;There seems to be clear parallels between the reluctance to enforce the law here just as there was with the Asian gangs.

Really? Like setting up a [*whole* unit dedicated to the crimes were talking about](http://content.met.police.uk/Site/gangcrime), that has been in place since the late 90's? That kind of reluctance?

&gt;social services become aware girls are being raped and there are talked to about conflict resolution and finding new hobbies. it's fucked.

Even if this were true, exactly what is it you expect them to do in the face of a girl reluctant to press charges? Simply arrest any swarthy fellow that next passes to make an example? You are aware how the police and law enforcement works, right?

Now back to these teachers you personally know of seemingly hiding rape that you are also aware of (odd world you move in, but who am I to judge). It's now *your* duty to shed light on this. Don't be coy, name names. Name schools. It is rape after all. Unless you're exhibiting the same said reluctance.

&gt;gang mediation, and 'diversion activities' are not acceptable alternatives to prosecution for rape.

Again, where is your proof people are somehow coddling *known* rapists? If you can't understand the need for the work that I posted above there's little else that will suffice for you. As I understand it the statistics you so helpfully provided seem to fly in the face of your theory these people are somehow not being arrested and sentenced.

They're stretched seriously thin, it's one of those things where I'm not sure the public really realise just how sparse the cover can be sometimes.

A few weeks back I was giving a statement to the police and learned that for a huge area, covering three towns and all the rural properties in between there were two of them.  Twenty thousand plus people and their properties, social problems and silly decisions the responsibility of two young policemen.

If its for year 14/15 - you might well have to pay all the arrears quickly and then negotiate the payment for the rest of the year as the council will want it up front.

If the summons is in your name, you can go to court and explain your self but its easier (and a bit cheaper) to just pay what is outstanding.  

TBH your lucky that you have received a summons - my council (Cornwall) will do the court order thing in secret after a single letter saying you are in arrears and then just send in the bailiffs 30 days later.  This has happened to me 3 times now - once when the bank screwed up and I was out of the country and twice whilst I was in Hospital (not that I would have been able to go to court but it would have been nice to have been warned ect)

They said that in A levels they usually forgive a B if all the grades level out in the end, so unless there are extremely many applicants this year, you should at least be given an interview.

These are generally very relaxed and you're not there to be judged, but rather for them to get to know you, so it's important to let your interest in English shine and be yourself. 

However, don't try too hard to persuade them that you're the one they want.

McHattie, Paterson, McGhee, Henderson, Walker, Oliver, Carrick, Robinson, Billy King. So I'd imagine they might currently be underrated. McGhee especially has been linked to English Premiership clubs.

And Billy King's brother Adam has moved to Swansea, so he should probably have that potential acknowledged. Jay Fulton also went to Swansea from Falkirk and has already started Premiership games, with Kingsley going to Swansea too.

There's Jack Harper who plays in the Real Madrid youth teams - he's constantly touted as the biggest thing in Scottish football in the years to come, but I don't think he's rated very highly on FM.

I don't know what the methodology is behind [this site](http://footballyouthtalents.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/world-best-young-players-born-in-1998/) but it rates a number of Scottish players:

- Calvin Miller, who also won some kind of international award for his age group

- Robbie McRorie

- Jack Breslin

- Michael Kelly

- Adam Hodge

- Greg Kiltie

I'd also say Stevie May and Chris Kane at St Johnstone are underrated given their respective scoring records this last year. As is Craig Wighton.

Sheffield United fans rave about Stefan Scougall.

And then there's a couple that I don't even know if are in the system - Charlie Gilmour at Arsenal and Joshua Laws at Fortuna Dusseldorf have been getting good reviews at u-16 level.

I know Mark O'Hara is rated very highly by Kilmarnock fans.

There's a young guy called Jordan Allan, not sure if he's in the game. The youngest player ever to play a competitive match in the UK, just moved to Wolves.

Charlie Telfer has just moved to Dundee United and is expected to get first-team action, I think currently he is very much a youth player in FM.

true,iamaravind,lfc12,,"well that's the thing, Madrid would prefer to keep di Maria cause both Ancelotti and Ronaldo like him, he's instrumental to their team play and the fact that Ancelotti has already blocked him for being sold in the last two windows tells you how much he respects the guy. but i agree if he is sold, he will go to Monaco/PSG.

Secondly, Man City will yes be all up on him cause of the Pellegrini/Malaga link, but there's **three catches**, one is that he'll again be a part time player behind the likely starting trio of Silva, Nasri and Navas. 

Two, is that they already have some sanctions from UEFA cause of FFP violations, so have to curb their spending to meet set requirements, meaning as is widely reported they can only afford to loan him then pay a big upfront fee to buy him.

Three, and not a widely known fact, is that City currently have 17 first team non-home grown players in their squad. With Mangala expected to sign, that takes it up to 18. BPL rules allow only a maximum of 17 such non-home grown players over the age of 21, so as far as foreign signings go, they're a bit streched out atm. Yes the arguement could be made that they can sell some to ease this and buy more english talent. But look at who's being rumoured to leave: Milner, Sinclair and Richards. All Home Grown, which just piles on the shit they have created by buying all these foreign talent instead of investing in English Youth.

First off, as sad as it is that these people have to come here from their countries to find work and a better life, its unacceptable to be letting them in. 
There is currently 7billion+ people in the world, the UK holds a population of 60million give or take, thats less THAN 1%. We currently have a major housing problem, with rising prices, lack of housing and unaffordable housing. We have a 6.8% unemployment rate, 4million+, and are currently experiencing cut backs the likes of which the country has never seen.
Yet you Idiots want to let these people into the country because they deserve it? Because they should have a right?
It is not ours, or our neighbours fault these people have been born into a poorer country,  and as sad as that is we just cant provide for these people. 
We struggle to provide for under 1% of the worlds population, and you lot want to take in more? Please explain to me, where do they go? What jobs do they do? Where do they live? 
Charity is great, but charity isnt about giving to people, charity is about teaching people. Give a man a fish, feed him for a day, teach a man to fish feed him for life! These people need to be sent home, and need to be educated on how to make their lives better there, they need to understand that life isnt better here, and that they can make something of themselves at home! 
Even after letting these people in, do you think their lives are better? They are taken advantage of from day one, they cant work legally, they dont live here, so they are underpaid and over worked, they are abused by gangs and companies that hire illegals. They live in cramped conditions, and tend to not have a better life than at home, to top it off immigration usually catch up to these people, they are removed and end up back in their original position. Is that really a better life to live?

true,katemonkey,null,null,"So I live in Nottingham. I'm a bit biased in that regards. Nottingham has a good nightlife (if you avoid certain areas filled with drunken douchebags). Nottingham has a few nature reserves and nice parks all within public transportation distance.  Nottingham is small(ish), but big enough to support a lot of neat things.

Leeds is a fun place to visit. The last time we went up there, we enjoyed the market, we enjoyed a couple of very nice restaurants, we enjoyed the Armoury Museum, and we enjoyed Tropical World, which was a ridiculous indoor zoo-type thing that shouldn't have been as fun as it was.

However, no matter how great it is, I can't live in Leeds. This is why:

I went up a few years ago to visit a friend. We had a good time, we spent most of the weekend in her place watching TV (it was that kind of nerdy friendship), but then we decided we should probably go out and get some air and actually eat dinner somewhere.

There was this lovely Moroccan place within walking distance of her flat, so we headed there.  And the food was lovely.

She was a student at the university there, so she lived in a place predominantly populated by students.  We were eating on the main road into town, so plenty of students were going by the restaurant's windows, dressed up in stupid costumes, obviously already drunk, the kind of thing you like to peoplewatch, but you're so glad that you're indoors and away from them.

One group of boys stopped, and one of them proceeded to slide down his trousers and start rubbing his dick against the glass, looking at the two of us the entire time. His vacant eyes stared at us, and he kept rubbing his dick, until the owner of the restaurant rushed out and started pushing him away, shouting at him.  He hobbled back out onto the pavement, his friends laughing at him.

We were laughing, because, seriously. Seriously. What were you trying to do, scare us? Make us overwhelmed with lust? Be so amazed with your penis that we instantly lost all appetite for our lovely dinners and instead have to follow you to whatever shitty chain nightclub you were going to, where you'd drink too many Carlings and then pass out halfway home?

But it means I'll never live in Leeds. Because in my mind, Leeds = Dick.

Every single truck that enters Calais port gets searched by French security staff. After this, select vehicles then get searched by UK Border Agency staff using a number of different technologies. When I was there (left in 2006), CO2 probes, floor mirrors and heartbeat monitors were used, together with X Ray machines in Dover and at the tunnel in Coquelles. 

The best way to stop people hiding in trucks is for the drivers to properly secure their vehicles - tilt cords and padlocks, customs seals etc. I'm not sure if it's still the case now but drivers would be fined if people were found in the back and they had security devices but weren't using them. Companies were fined if they failed to provide their drivers with the products that could secure their vehicles.

The ""making"" part is interesting in my opinion. It's one of these things where the letter of the law is satisfied but the spirit of the law is a bit less clear.

When accessing a file on a web server (just for purposes of the example), your web browser doesn't *move* the file from the server to your computer, it *copies* it. There was one instance of the file, now there are two - you have created a copy. Similarly if you were to save files to CD/USB. In fact, the usual operation of the browser and filesystem will probably have created a few copies just in their general operation.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"If I understand correctly, though, once your computer equipment is seized hard disks, SSDs, flash sticks etc are unlikely to be returned if there's the slightest trace of an illegal indecent image, intentionally downloaded or not, and irrespective of prosecution.

I'm guessing the logic is that the image is still illegal, but removing the image so that it 100% definitely cannot be recovered is extremely difficult, so no-one's going to pay for that.

Even those secure removal programs that overwrite the files with random rubbish many times over cannot ensure that the relevant sectors weren't swapped around by the drive to prevent excessive wear or because a sector appeared to have an error on it - mostly a problem for SSDs, but still potentially an issue for hard disks. In theory, the content of those swapped-around sectors is still accessible in the free space, and those swapped-out-due-to-errors sectors could theoretically still be accessed by changing the drives firmware.

IMO it's pretty silly - if an image got on your hard disk by accident, it's obviously out there and a lot easier to get hold than by using specialist data recovery techniques that even the CIA would only use in very special circumstances. Even so - the law probably just says the illegal images won't be returned, with no allowances for ignoring absurd recovery possibilities.

In any case, by the time the seized equipment has been searched and returned, it may well be obsolete anyway.

true,kvqyzx,null,null,"&gt; once your computer equipment is seized hard disks, SSDs, flash sticks etc are unlikely to be returned if there's the slightest trace of an illegal indecent image

You're correct, but not really for the reasons you think.

The investigation will be done on a bit-for-bit copy of the media - a forensic image - not on the original media itself (As an aside, that's why the whole ""enter a duress password and wipe the disk"" scheme is laughably useless).

Removing files from disk is simply a matter of overwriting it with a single pass. Something like DBAN will do this, although it relies on the disk controller to accurately tell it about bad sectors, etc and has problems with SSDs due to things like wear levelling. Modern disks (SSDs included) should support the ATA Secure Erase commands - that's much better.

The issue usually isn't with returning the equipment especially after an acquittal - that's easy as I outlined above. Just flatten the disk and hand it back. The issue is with returning the suspect's *data* - personal files entirely unrelated to the case - that's where the resource constraints come in. It's a very manual process and potentially fraught with legal difficulties in itself. 

The main reason that equipment is retained though is in case of legal appeals, which could last for years afterward.",0,1405853118,null,0,false,0,cj2h1ct,t3_2b73qu,t1_cj2h1ct,t1_cj2gwlw,null,1434804432,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

tiident wasn't set up to deal with rape.  

Didn't read the article? Now that gun and knife crime has fallen they have deigned to protect the lowly wenches.  finally.  15vyears after that documentary came out,  and there have been others since.

It's an odd world's II live in being married to a teacher? 


Does it make you feel better to pretend that there is not a problem with the moral compass of the black community?

So I tried to cut and paste it to a word document to see about editing it while having a running character total and my computer decided to not actually admit it ever existed.

So I'm sat here with a mostly blank comment box and a red message saying ""this is too long (Max: 10000)"" like a dickhead. I'm not typing all that shit out again and to be quite frank you can go fuck yourself if you think I'm going to try given your allegations against me regarding expenses. Pro-tip: my job does allow for expenses for everyone, it'd be easy to fuck about with them, but we don't do that because we have a regional budget and it'd detract money from some of the comforts we have at work which we would like to keep. MPs do not have that motivation because everything is subsidised and they don't have to worry about profit margins because tax.

Comparing CEOs and Directors to MPs is stupid because each company has about twenty Directors at most and one CEO, we have hundreds of MPs and their shadow equivalents. 

If you must compare Corporations to Governments then you should do so for everything and not just pay, up to and including how pay is earned. If you worked for any company and asked for your pay to be doubled while giving back nothing in return you'd be laughed out of the room.

Increasing pay doesn't guarantee that the best and brightest will come to the job but it does guarantee that greedy dickheads will be more enticed by it.

The Government has for more than a decade now actively refused to update certain aspects of infrastructure or public services and have recently decided to fire hundreds if not thousands for some bullshit about debt reduction when having debt can be a good thing because credit rating.

We live in a disillusioned time where the Government protests its' impotence but is always seeking more power to do pointless bullshit where police are regarded with suspicion and we are constantly doing business selling arms to the worst people in the world and then wondering why people hate us.

Losing expenses is unlikely to happen in any scenario because of the incredible opposition MPs put up to the expenses system being so much as reformed slightly, much less abolished.

and finally, fuck you sunshine, I don't take what I'm not owed and I'm not owed what I don't work for. If that concept is so alien to you then frankly I wonder why you get to be the cynical one here when it comes to expenses fiddling, especially given that the people that actually did all that are the people you're seeking to reward.

Yes, I understand that.

&gt; Modern disks (SSDs included) should support the ATA Secure Erase commands

I didn't know about that - maybe those commands didn't exist last time I took an interest in these things?

&gt; Just flatten the disk and hand it back.

That's not exactly what people have in mind when they want their equipment returned. Working condition as-when-seized would generally be appreciated. If you're going to trash it, it's the legal systems fault that it's now trash and the legal system should pay for disposal of that trash thankyou very much. And where there was no crime, compensation for destroying property would seem obvious too.

&gt; The main reason that equipment is retained though is in case of legal appeals

Of course no-one is going to appeal if there's not going to be a prosecution.

I know from past experience in my family that it takes a long time even to get around to searching equipment. And once the police get the idea that actually you're not just innocent, but it's actually impossible for you to have committed the crime you're accused of, that leads to two more sources of delays...

1.  You're now a low priority for the search - no point rushing to search something where there's nothing to be found.

2.  Arse-covering.

With that combo, you have to cause big trouble to get your equipment returned even in months rather than years.

Sorry to belabour this point, you seem not to understand so I'll try again.

So tomorrow people *outside* law enforcement, education, child protection and welfare services, healthcare and other social volunteer groups find out that this is a widespread issue that they didn't know of before.

So now your local butcher knows. Your taxi driver, your plumber, your accountant and school dinner lady. What now? Exactly what has changed? The people tasked with the problem who already know about the problem and are already trying to solve the problem  are still the only ones all of the above will look to to solve the problem.

Damned if you do damned if you don't eh. Fuck them for only reducing *some* crimes, the lazy bastards.

No, it was set up to deal with gang crime. Gangs carrying out rape would be one of those things. It would be impractical to set up separate units for each and every statute that requires prosecution.

&gt;Does it make you feel better to pretend that there is not a problem with the moral compass of the black community?

And there we have it. I was unaware my morals were so skewed. Why just the other day as I pulled my own dear mother off her latest rape victim I thought ""what should be done about us?"".

So I defer to a better mind than I. What should be done about us?

You simply keep reiterating there is a problem. You seemed to have an idea how it could be better tackled when you started, but now you seem to have no answers apart from some ill thought out advertising campaign to let the general public know black people have a problem with their moral compass. What this would achieve, you're once again unable to clearly articulate.

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean, but I assume you're attempting to say you're  married to a teacher? Well, have they seen these rape videos? Why aren't they doing anything about it? What's wrong with *their* moral compass?

There needs to be some adjustment in terms of how EA Sports Ignite works to facilitate the open nature of PC architecture, rather than the closed nature of console architecture.

Under current rules you can choose to buy an annuity or use capped/flexible drawdown. If you want to buy an annuity and you have several different pots you can simply do the annuity application and tell them you have several different pots. The annuity provider contacts each pension and gets the money from them. However some providers do not allow drawdown, so you need to find a provider who does allow it and move your pensions to this provider.

How does it work? The problem is that a single offer could be applied to multiple subsets of your items (e.g. if you have the items for a meal deal + another sandwich). At least Sainsbury's checkouts seem to choose the subset that minimizes the total price, no matter in what order you're scanning the items. But if it applies offers live, there are two possibilities: it applies an offer as soon as possible and it potentially screws over the customer or it sometimes removes previously applied offers, which seems like it could get confusing.

true,elevendayempire,null,null,"Director. IIRC Eccleston's main beef was with Keith Boak, the director for the first block of episodes. RTD had always wanted to work with Boak, but hadn't taken account of one important detail; people tended not to work with him twice. I can't speak to whether he was bullying crew members, but the consensus is that Eccleston had pretty much made his decision to leave after the first block was filmed, and that Boak was the reason why.

Boak's largely responsible for the tonal misfire of the first block of episodes (Rose/Aliens of London/WWIII) – the ""childish"" feel that so many have complained about. Note that by the time they got around to filming Aliens of London/WWIII, RTD had stepped in and added more mature scenes (Mickey and the Doctor in the TARDIS, for example).

RTD also approached Geoffrey Sax, director of the Paul McGann TV Movie, to helm the first block of episodes; unfortunately, Sax was off in the US directing White Noise. It's one of the great ""what ifs"" of Who; if Sax had directed the first block instead of Boak, Eccleston would probably have done at least one more year of Doctor Who. 

Interestingly, the alternate ending of The Parting of the Ways reads like it was intended to lead directly into New Earth; the TARDIS reports that Rose is dying, having absorbed the energy of the Time Vortex, so it makes sense that the Doctor would want to take her to the best hospital in the universe (this takes account of the fact that The Christmas Invasion was a late addition to the series).

The current thinking in the industry is that flaws with the systems can counter-intuitively give the impression of irritating delays - although overall the systems are still faster than checkouts whilst using fewer or the same number of staff and most of the delay is actually psychological. 

For example I've noticed Sainsburys and Asda have tweaked their systems to be slightly more gentle with the *""Please Place the Item in the Bagging Area""* warnings, as they are deeply infuriating. Wireless payment for purchases under £20 is also being rolled out which speeds the payment process up considerably. It also helps that consumers are getting used to the technology and understanding some of the previously cryptic messages like the enraging *""Unexpected Item in the Bagging Area""*.

Most of the current issues come from the accuracy of the scale mechanism... and in fairness it has a pretty tough job to do discerning between items like a 4 pack of 2L bottle of soft drink (9Kg+) and small items like a gift card or battery that might not even weigh 20g. Their plan at the moment is for the next generation kiosks to move away from product weight as a security mechanism... either to computer generated random checks (Waitrose already do this on their self-scan (not the same as self checkout) payments) OR things like mobile phone logging or a kind of high tech RFID mechanism.

I don't think that it would require someone to intentionally download a specific image, but for someone to intentionally download content that includes the image. Otherwise a person could browse websites showing extreme images with no risk of prosecution.

* Tesco tend to buy larger warehouse style premises on land they own, often in town centres. Aldi and Lidl build smaller ""medium"" sized stores often on cheaper land closer to their target demographics (for example typically on the edge of council estates or in cheaper parts of a shopping/town centre).

* Aldi and Lidl only stock a very small number of items - about 1500, whereas most Tescos stock closer to 40,000. Strictly speaking Aldi and Lidl are discounters - they sell normal or premium quality products at lower prices by making savings on their supply chain and premises - as well as deals with the product manufacturers. Tesco on the other hand stock products at every level of quality. Their basic range is actually a basic slimmed down product with fewer or lower quality ingredients, rather than a discounted product like Lidl sell.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;The subsection (c) defence probably won't work for Internet browsing as visiting a website could count as ""requesting the image"" (applying how browsing works with copyright law). I don't think that it would require someone to intentionally download a specific image, but for someone to intentionally download content that includes the image. Otherwise a person could browse websites showing extreme images with no risk of prosecution.  

How is ""requesting an image"" interpreted in copyright law? If you don't mind sparing me the research...  

For what it's worth, I'm not trying to draw a distinction between deliberately accessing an image and deliberately accessing a webpage in order to view an image. The situation that I think might be covered by defence (c) is if you were to view a website without any prior indication that it might contain an extreme pornographic image. It's hard to see how that course of action would sensibly count as ""requesting"" the image, but perhaps the definition in copyright would suggest otherwise.

&gt;...but those are for the defendant to prove.

That's certainly a fair point which escaped me when I wrote my previous comment. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would work in practice. It isn't possible to prove that a defendant had no cause to suspect the extreme pornographic nature of an image, is it? That would be proving a negative. Again, I could be reading it wrongly, but it seems that, for the defence to have any purpose, it must be possible to prove defence (b) if there is nothing to suggest that the defendant did have cause for suspicion. I can't see how else the defence could ever be applicable.

Incidentally...

I've also found that the self-service machines don't seem to always recognise deals which the staffed tills have previously picked up fine. You have to call a staff member over (then wait half an hour for them to notice you, even if there's barely anyone else around) to get it fixed.

Between that and their other issues (annoying little things like you can't pick up a bunch of smaller items and scan them all before placing them on the bag side or the till can't cope and having to wait for a staff member if you have anything that's sharp or has an age limit attached) I still much prefer staffed tills.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I doubt Suso will stick around to be honest.  If he does then we have 6 players for 3 positions, and we're bang on where we want to be.  Competition in the squad is extremely healthy.  If he doesn't then we're 5 players for 3 positions, which is still great.  There will be plenty of games this season and with injuries as well, each should find plenty of time on the pitch.  BR has managed the playing time of Coutinho and Sterling very well in the past 2 seasons in spite of not really having good other options when he rests them and we need to be careful not to overplay them anyway.  We'll be totally fine if we have them all.  Think of it this way:

----------------------------------Gerrard/Can/Lucas---------------------------------------

---------------------Hendo/Can/Allen ------- Isco/Coutinho/Lallana-----------------------

Sterling/Markovic/Lallana-----Sturride/Lambert/Remy-----Lallana/Markovic/Sterling

I wouldn't expect to see Markovic starting most games this season.  It'll take him time to get his feet on the ground in England and he'll need to go hard on the weights to adjust to the more physical nature of the league (just like Sterling when he came through).  He's an awesome super sub to have who will slowly carve out his own spot.  Lallana is great coming from a wider position as well as through the middle, but with Isco/Coutinho you can expect him to start wider.  The only real potential victim in this is Coutinho, and even then he'll still see plenty of game time.  I'm not thrilled about seeing my future favorite player take a step back in the pecking order, but Isco is just much better at the moment.  

As for the formation... Coutinho was the 8 in the midfield 3 for a few games towards the end of the season (including the City match, where he was outstanding against Yaya/Fernandinho) and he definitely played his best football there.  I doubt we'll go 4-2-3-1 because it doesn't suit BR's tactics well enough, it's too rigid.  He likes to have a fluid formation that changes shape pretty drastically depending on the phase of the game.  Even with the diamond, when we defended it turned into a 4-3-3 and then reverted back into the diamond as we moved forwards.  This is why he's buying so many intelligent and versatile players, they're very adaptable.

I can get in and out of Aldi in under an hour without having to deal with too big a range of products, trying to decide if the bogofs are actually good value and the temptation of all the strategically placed potential impulse buys.

Tesco seems designed to squeeze the last penny out of shoppers in sometimes very devious ways and I resent being treated like a mug. Since it is geographically my corner shop I will pop in there for the odd item, but do a big shop there? Never again.

The opinions of the British government are reported domestically as being taken seriously across the world but to think that Russia, the US or China give that much of a hoot is to be arrogant to the extreme about the importance of the UK.  I imagine that the Danish government believes that the Danish standpoint is taken seriously around the world too, yet we here hear nothing of that country.

Being part of the the EU has probably allowed us to be higher up the pecking order than we should rightfully be. As a small country it can only help us to be part of a larger community - should we get dragged out of the EU then I fear we'll have to become even more subordinate to US interests in order to for anyone to notice us.

Regardless, the writing is on the wall. Whether it's a matter of population numbers, military power or economic strength, the UK's historic power is certain to be something which won't continue long in to the future.

The only solution I can see is quietly sitting down with Israel and making it abundantly clear that support for them will be withdrawn unless they tow the line, completely, and that this is their one chance not to be humiliated in front of the rest of the Middle East and if they comply quietly they can try to spin it as positively as they can.

I think singing about freedom is allowed but singing about killing the queen and British soldiers etc isn't.  There's a fine line.

There are four 1KG bags of veg here. Thats's 4KG / 7 days = 571g/day.

Let's look at the nutrition:

Frozen peas = 68 calories per 100g

Frozen sweetcorn = 115 calories per 100g

Frozen broccoli = 30 calories per 100g

Brown rice = 353 calories per 100g

Assuming you eat 1/7th of each every day you'll end up with 97 + 164 + 43 + 505 = 809 calories per day for your main meal. 

Whole milk = 67 calories per 100ml
Sainsbury's Basics wheat cereal biscuits = 359 calories per 100g, or 65 per biscuit. It's a pack of 24 so most days you have have 3. With 1/7th of your milk you get 195 (biscuits) + 191 (milk) = 386 calories.

So you get 809 + 386 = 1,195 calories per day. Very little protein, very little fat. Mostly carbs. Just like OP's selection, you can't live on this.

Go back - I said that our ""larger than life"" presence in international affairs was because of historical accidents like winning a permanent place on the anachronistic but significant UN security council. I'm aware that Denmark doesn't have such a place - hence it being something that makes our country more ""significant"" than theirs.

Our relations with the US are far from symbiotic, instead being more cautiously parasitic. Us holding on to their nuclear coat tails whilst they cosy up to us when they need UNSC backing or military assistance to invade somewhere like Afghanistan or Iraq. The same doesn't apply in reverse - the Falklands / Suez.  As long as we are useful to the US, and we have useful idiots to go along with it, then we're ok to sit in their shadow.  

Being ""home"" of the Anglosphere grants us additional favours. Obama himself has said that the UK should remain part of the EU - we're a useful bridge between the US and rest of Europe. Again - useful to the US. 

In a bygone era of Empire we didn't have to worry about being useful to anyone else - we were the superpower. Now we're not. Historical accidents like the UNSC membership will carry us so far but don't expect to be able to count on that forever, it's an anomaly that will one day have to be reformed/restructured less the BRICS (population 3.3 billion) , and I'm thinking of India and Brazil in particular,  end up having to make their own ""UN"".

It will give us a spark of hope as Sanchez and Reus did before him, there will be fake rumours that he is open to a move to Liverpool and then he will go to Man City. Since when have Liverpool actually signed a world class player from a big club?, We have always bought good players from average clubs (Mascherano from West Ham, Alonso from Real Sociedad, Torres from At Madrid, Suarez from Ajax, Sterling from QPR, Lallana from Southampton) the only exceptions to this I can recall in recent times are Sturridge, Sakho and Coutinho (if Inter is still considered as a big club). And lets face it, a big selling point that made these players want to come was the fact that they could play with Suarez on a weekly basis. Since when would a player from one of the top clubs(Bayern, Real, Barca) even consider coming to Liverpool when there are better clubs in the hunt for them with more world class players to play next to and more money being offered. I know that we finished second last year and it wasn't all because of Suarez but when you have a choice of playing next to Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and a Steven Gerrard who will probably retire soon, and another choice of playing next to Aguero, Silva, Yaya Toure. It isn't really a debate which team you choose (unless history means a great deal to you or maybe you were a Liverpool supporter when younger). The last time I can remember a player coming from a world class club to Liverpool was Luis Garcia (and arguably that was before Barca truly became a world class club) and no, nuri sahin on loan does not count.

I'm not a hero but i would proudly be prosecuted for my beliefs, though in terms of the law it would be better to put the fascists in their place for harassment by knowing exactly where you stand. I've tried googling the law but it yielded nothing crystal clear.

I understand any songs about killing british is seen as incitement or provocation. The most notorious that baffles me is the roll of honour. The worst part i can think of is ""england you're a monster"" the rest is singing about solidarity (perhaps it's becaise its seen as glorifying enemies of the crown...) yet people have been given jail time. It's a shambles.

This is a government that, when their practices are struck down by the courts as illegal, their first response is to create new, more draconian watertight legislation that makes it legal again! And you want to trust these people with your basic rights?

We helped create the ECHR, it's utter lunacy to leave unless our politicians have decided to take another approach with regards to human rights.

If you have a left back like Baines, you need someone who can cover, like Peinaar.  Oviedo won't do it, and I don't think his attacking contribution is any better than anyone else we'd play on the left, and  Mirallas at least does track back some.  I don't see Oviedo as more than a bit part player.  He could be pretty good for a team like Stoke, or Villa, a solid premier league club, that is well-established, but really isn't going anywhere.

He is not the best in the world at his position right now, but he is more than capable of being just that in 2 years.

While I agree that a LB is a priority, and maybe an RB or CB I think spending money on great defenders isn't the number one priority in sorting out our defence, I think it is to have a better defensive strategy. Sakho has the potential to be one of the best CBs in the world (he's still only 24) and Skrtel is definitely good enough for a top side in the PL. Agger Kolo and Coates + possibly Lovren or some other new signing of his quality is more than enough as back up.

&gt;__Cumbric__ was a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics\)) of the [Common Brittonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Brittonic) language spoken during the [Early Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages) in the *[Hen Ogledd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hen_Ogledd)* or ""Old North"" in what is now [Northern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England) and southern [Lowland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands) [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland).  It was closely related to [Old Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Welsh) and the other [Brittonic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittonic_languages). Place name evidence suggests Cumbric speakers may have carried it into other parts of northern England as migrants from its core area further north.  It may also have been spoken as far south as [Pendle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendle) and the [Yorkshire Dales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Dales). Most linguists believe that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent [Kingdom of Strathclyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde) into the [Kingdom of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland).

We have signed players like Sahin in recent years and, going back a couple more years, have managed to sign players that all the top clubs were after (Cisse being one of them - I know it didn't work out, but still). Edit: I think Morientes was still considered world class when we bought him - he just didn't fit in.

Also, Liverpool is still a respected team, we were once the most dominant force in Europe. Now we are not. But that reputation is still there. That spirit is still there. And, probably for the first time since our fall, we are building a long term project where we are moving back to brighter days. 

Not all players will buy into this idea. Some are motivated more by money, others geography, other's recent success. But some worldclass players might buy into our project.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"My understanding of copyright (although the CJEU could change it at any moment) is that when a person clicks a link to a webpage they are requesting the content, and a copy of whatever is on that page is made, on their computer, by them. There was a fairly controversial case [NLA v Meltwater] where it was even held that where a person opens up an email they are creating a copy of the contents of the email on their computer (even if they didn't ask the sender to send it). That case was appealed and referred to the CJEU so was overturned on another point, and didn't really discuss some aspects, but might be applied by analogy.

The general approach seems to be that when a website is visited copies of files are made, they have to be made by someone, so they are made by the person who triggers the process. There is a causal link that begins with the person clicking a link and ends with a copy being created. Of course, copyright law cares less about intention, so criminal law could be different.

I imagine that if someone visited a website, had no indication that it might contain illegal images, and then backed away quickly (and cleared caches etc.), a court would probably go with defence (c) applying. But I can also imagine some overzealous police officer or prosecutor arguing the other way, resulting in guilty pleas or at least a long pre-trial period. Particularly if this was all there was to go on and the person had already been arrested.

On defences, it was my impression that defences worked that way as well (adducing evidence, the prosecution having to disprove beyond reasonable doubt) but the article I was reading on these laws stated that it was a ""prove on balance"" thing. They may be wrong, particularly when the ECHR is applied.

As for not checking, that is understandable, but a little disturbing. The fear these sorts of law create (particularly wrt the complexity of the law and how hard it is to understand) helps stigmatise what is arguably perfectly harmless interests (assuming that vore is that - I don't know if there is evidence).

It's also worth noting that defence (c) doesn't apply in the case of 'normal' indecent images of children; that only has the legitimate reason defence and the (b) defence. When the law was passed it made sense as the PoCA applied to taking photographs, distributing or publishing them or possessing with a view to distributing. But the law has been changed to cover ""making"" photographs, ""photograph"" has been expanded to cover computer files, and ""making"" has been interpreted by the courts as covering downloading.",0,1405869894,null,0,false,0,cj2l1u8,t3_2b73qu,t1_cj2l1u8,t1_cj2i2jb,null,1434806417,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It would be a big gamble, and would start a race to the bottom.

They probably don't want to as well - Aldi and Lidl have found a niche that wasn't being catered for in Britain, selling good quality but basic merchandise at a low price, but they won't become as dominant as Tesco once was. Tesco just need to find what their niche is and start doing it as well as they can. Sainsburys actually seem to be doing relatively well in this respect.

IMO its part of a trend of British consumers becoming more like American consumers; we used to buy most of our shopping in one big go at one shop. Tesco got big by doing everything and doing it relatively well, and doing it at a time when British consumers were getting significantly better off from the late 80s to the early 2000s. But now real incomes have been falling, and people are shopping around to get the best deals. I once saw an interesting statistic about how many different stores consumers in Britain and America go to when doing their grocery shopping, In Britain it was one or two but in America it was more. I suspect this is changing.

The Scottish club, which currently dispute the previous qualifying round to the group stage of the Champions League, was the most suitable destination to find the Yellow Submarine among several clubs that asked for him, including Rayo Vallecano de Madrid.

However with the departing of Suárez and our qualification into the CL, we're gonna need depth in basically all of our positions, to be able to rotate the squad and make sure everyone isn't too pushed for the tournaments we're in. 

Suárez left a hole in our offense, we currently have Lambert and Sturridge as our two strikers at this moment, with Borini looking at an exit very soon. If we manage to purchase two strikers, Remy is looking like the first, we'll have enough for the competitions we're in. 

Additionally, the midfield was further strengthened by Rodgers' delve into that market. He purchased three strong players to help us in the attacking side of the midfield and with the playmaking, which will definitely be a big part of our next season's football. 

The defense also still needs work. We have Flanagan and Enrique at the LB position and currently Johnson at RB.

Transfer betting is very volatile because the bookies are shit scared of getting cleaned by somebody with inside knowledge, so even a relatively small amount of money wagered can and will greatly affect the price. In addition to the jumpiness of the bookies, rumours started off an ITK account on twitter or whatever can result in multiple wagers which will also drive the price down. So while odds for certain markets can be a reliable indicator of how things are going to pan out, transfer odds are most certainly not.

No it hasn't, we were solid at the back under Dalglish and Clarke. Defending is a collective effort that involves the whole defence and midfield, so throwing money at it is unlikely to solve any problems.

We need a quality left back and another CB to compete with Sakho-Skrtel but anything more than that would be overkill. Sakho can be rock solid, Skrtel is good, Agger is great cover, a fit Enrique is very good and Johnson can still do a job.

Because all those foreign 'cash' buyers from China are actually leveraged up to fuck on their domestic assets. China has undergone an expansion in credit that dwarves ours. When growth slows, many of these entrepeneurs will be exposed and unable to repay their debts. All that foreign cash may dry up very quickly. And they know it - that's why there's a massive dash to buy foreign property, to expatriate as much as they can, as quickly as possible. It cannot go on forever.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;On defences, it was my impression that defences worked that way as well (adducing evidence, the prosecution having to disprove beyond reasonable doubt) but the article I was reading on these laws stated that it was a ""prove on balance"" thing. They may be wrong, particularly when the ECHR is applied.  

I haven't done in-depth research (it's Sunday!), but Halsbury's Laws of England suggests that the question is currently unanswered by case law and mentions the possibility that a persuasive burden of proof with respect to these defences would infringe the defendant's ECHR right to the presumption of innocence. You may disagree with that interpretation, but I mention it for what it's worth.  

&gt;As for not checking, that is understandable, but a little disturbing. The fear these sorts of law create (particularly wrt the complexity of the law and how hard it is to understand) helps stigmatise what is arguably perfectly harmless interests (assuming that vore is that - I don't know if there is evidence).  

Yeah, I agree. From the definition of ""extreme pornographic images"", I have to ask myself:

- Does it portray an act which threatens a person's life (or satisfy any of the other subsections of s.63(7))?
- Does it portray the act explicitly and realistically?
- Would a reasonable person looking at the image think that the person in question was real?  

Three obvious problems with this.  

Firstly, even if I can say ""yes"" confidently to the first question, which I would assume that I can, I won't be able to judge the answer to the other two questions until I've seen the image and potentially committed the offence, not being confident that I'll have a valid defence. That makes it virtually impossible for people who want to seek legal examples of vore porn to do so safely.  

Secondly, a depiction of a real person in a realistic but openly fictional scenario could easily qualify as extreme pornography. The statute requires that a reasonable person would think that the *person* depicted was real, but not that a reasonable person would think that the *act* depicted was real, only that it was realistic. Was that the legislators' intention? It seems unlikely.

Thirdly, as you say, it's incredibly difficult to figure out what the law actually is and exactly what you're allowed to do - I don't think we've managed to do it, have we? That confusion entails the risk not only of catching people out who have no intention of doing anything illegal, but also of discouraging people from doing things that they would actually be allowed to do. As hard as most people will find it to relate to the appeal of vore (and without having looked, I don't think I get the appeal myself), it's pretty illiberal to rob people of harmless expressions of their sexuality or curiosity.

So, yeah. Not a great law, as far as I can tell.",0,1405874520,null,0,1405874741,0,cj2mtl6,t3_2b73qu,t1_cj2mtl6,t1_cj2l1u8,null,1434807269,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There's no blip about it - the world respects us because of our first class financial and legal sectors. Regardless of history we are still very influential.

China has a landmass near on 10x the size of the UK - to support their growth they *need* high speed transport. We would benefit but manufacture isn't our primary industry so there's much less of a need.

No, you do. Please link me to all of these liberal types running local councils.

What measures? What part of ""institutionally racist"" *don't* you understand?

&gt; Just because bad things happen at the right-most end of the political spectrum on local councils doesn't mean that the left-most end functions perfectly. 

There is no left end. Are you even listening to me? Local politics is a political graveyard for people deemed not good enough for national politics.

No, it's not. Just one link to one story where someone says they tried to prevent something like the ""Trojan Horse"" but were censured because of political correctness.

Don't know how or when this deal happens, would be good if he could move before January (to Everton), because I think he could get more playing time and adjust better during summer/autumn than coming into an already ""done"" squad in January.

In Tesco they achieve this by having clusters of 6 or 10 self-service checkouts supervised by a single member of staff.

In Aldi &amp; Lidl they tend to have a single person on checkouts and when they get busy they ring a bell and someone leaves the floor or the warehouse to open a second one.

Stalling of self-service checkouts would seem to be disruptive in a Lidl or Aldi.

Watch the midfield start to counter attack, the ball moves quickly from the back of the midfield to the front, ball comes to Ramires who played the ball behind the run of play/to the other team/shoots it too optimistically from far beyond where he can score.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"They were solid at the back with Kenny because of the way we played as a team.  Brendan has a completely different tactical game in mind, and some of our defenders don't work particularly well in that system.  Skrtel in particular I think is the oddball of the group, and I like the Lovren link because it would get us someone in to shore up RCB.  Sakho's a beast and if he stays fit, we'll be ok there with Agger as very reliable cover.

The fullbacks are the biggest issue by a wide margin in my opinion.  Johnson has just been poor for a couple of seasons running now.  You don't just go from great to shit like he has, but for whatever reason we can't seem to get him going again.  He's getting older too, we should be looking at a new RB who is suited to BR's system.

We missed Enrique hugely at LB last season, which made us struggle a lot.  Cissokho was terrible in his first few games but ended up a reliable defender, just nothing else after that.  Flanno stepped up huge but he's not good enough to rely on week in-week out if we're looking to mount a challenge for one or more trophies.  Again, a LB that is suited to BR's high intensity, end to end idea is going to be priority buy.  Moreno is exactly that, which is why we've been after him.  I'm still hoping that one comes good, he'll be worth it.

We wouldn't be just ""throwing money at it"" as you say, because they're clearly identifiable positions that we don't have the type of player we need in yet, thus it's money well spent to get the right ones in.",0,1405877588,null,0,false,0,cj2o2ew,t3_2b7ip5,t1_cj2o2ew,t1_cj2lyrv,null,1434807904,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

...but if you want to change the goalposts, great!  You're on even worse grounds with grammar.  Standard English is just a variety of English amongst many  - the standard variety - and has almost exclusive use in formal contexts for the written form.  Reddit and twitter aren't formal contexts.  The number of different varieties of English just within the UK is very large, and if you start to think that there's only 'one' correct form - as chosen by nice rich folks who are empowered to tell other people they're wrong - then you're deluded, ignorant or willfully bigoted.  CORRECT is whatever is naturally understood by two interlocutors of the same dialect.

When Irvine Welsh writes in his own and other dialects, Is he 'wrong'?  When west country people have all forms of 'to be' as 'be' - I be, You be, etc. - are they 'wrong'?  What about 'right' version of all right/allright/alright?  What about a Professor of Genetics who uses 'us data' in place of standard 'our data' informally - that is, in his natural dialect?

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"We need a backup keeper, Vorm is much better suited to fill the role of backup GK and have similar plyaing style to Hugo than Brad is....means if we have to play a backup keeper (be it in cups or by injury) we don't have to adjust the manner of defending as Vorm is good with the ball at his feet and isn't afraid to come out of net.

Swans have signed Fabianski who presumably wouldn't have left Arsenal to be a no.2 (as he could have just remained with Arsenal if that was the case) and don't have need for 2 talented GK when they have some more glaring issues to deal with.

For Vorm, he could probably start for a mid/low table team...problem being most of the teams in that area have a GK already or have more pressing issues that need to be dealt with first.

In addition Vorm makes something like £18k/wk in wages at Swansea, he isn't going to get a raise with Swansea and most of the teams that fall into the mid-table wouldn't be able to offer him much more money than he is already paid. 

So for Vorm you have a 30 year old GK with little market for his services at the moment...and while he probably has anywhere from 4-6 years of PL level play left in him he may not have many more opportunities to get an improvement on wages.  His best option to get an improved contract would be with Spurs, LFC or Arsenal (all rumoured to be interested in him) as a backup where he would probably get his wages close to doubled and still get a fair amount of playing time.",0,1405878251,null,0,false,0,cj2ochn,t3_2b80rl,t1_cj2ochn,t3_2b80rl,null,1434807970,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

This isn't proper advice, but I'd consider renouncing your role as executor because it can only really cause you trouble.

To have a legend like him back would bring much needed leadership to the squad. With Lampard and Cole gone that would fill a gap. I assume we would get him for free as well which is great. To have him continue in the club as a coach would be wonderfull.

But what would he bring to us as a player? He was mediocre (at best) in the PL in his last season for us. He showed up in the big CL-games though. We need someone who can score 20+ goals. And I just can't see how Drogba doing that this season.

United brought Scholes back as a short term fix for their midfield. Wasn't that one of the reasons that Pogba left them? When you have able, young talent in your club. Why not use them instead of bringing back older legends past their prime?

Now travel just 4 miles down the road to a bigger stand alone Asda, which stands to have no competition from anything in that radius, the prices are back up there. 

I, like a lot of the people here have already said, hate going to Aldi/Lidl due to the depressing atmosphere but I completely love how they are promoting competition. Too long have the big four chains been getting away with monopoly in this market. Tesco used to be go to for my local weekly shop, but their prices have for the long time now been eye watering. No wonder Waitrose has seen a large increase in the business. Teso and such, have pushed their middle class demographic into open arms of the businesses that sell premium product for almost exact same price and vastly improved quality.

If Costa doesn't score for three games (and has three bad games), i'm sure Mourinho would at least start Torres/Lukaku for one game. Ba earned his spot over Torres/Eto'o after scoring several vital goals in different games in a row. It only takes one to two really good games in a row to show that you earned a starting spot. When you get that chance, you make the most of it. Like Ba did, and try to keep it. It depends on his performance only really. It's not like he is going to be locked out of playing time forever, he will get some time. What matters is if he can show Mournhio that what he does with his time is better than Costa/Torres.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"I think there are a number of things to consider. 

1) when he was in power there was an awesome spin machine in place that we have never seen the like of. 

2) Blair changed the rules on sitting tenants which saw a massive rise in the ""buy to let boom"" which trebled house prices making houses unaffordable for many and meaning a life of renting was transferring wealth from young to old and poor to rich
[house prices under Blairs leadership](http://i.imgur.com/kxkAwNV.png) [ source](http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/uk_politics/07/blair_graphs/html/default.stm#event_9)

3) Economically Blair inherited a steady growing economy.  People didn't vote John Major out for failure but out of boredom. Lots of the Blair growth was people spending against the value of their property

4) The Minimum wage was introduced so low as to make no difference to many people. It is only necessary now as the cost of housing is so high.

5) More people, in work, are in need of financial assistance. Their biggest out going is the cost of housing - a side effect of Blairs rent reforms.

6) Blair didn't start the change to minority rights. Legislation towards the LGBT community was already changing under Major. Majors government started the move to equality and changed the age of consent form 21 to 18 [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#United_Kingdom_.28and_dependencies.29) and it was a consevative/liberal coalition that saw marriage equality introduced.

7) Mass immigration started in the post war years when people came from the ""commonwealth"". Blair signed a free market treaty that had EU migration as a stipulation. The initial estimates were of 2,000-3,000 immigrants from eastern europe. Blair didn't intend to make a more open Britain they just miscalculated. 

8) Blair never properly regulated the financial or housing markets helping to contribute to one of the worlds largest economic collapses in recent history.

Blair was a mediocre domestic prime minister with a mixed but overall failed foreign affairs record. The only thing truly exceptional about Tony Blair was the PR spin.

Oh, me too. It's not that I believe someone should have someone do it for me, so much as that I resent not seeing a cost reduction as a result of them alleviating themselves of a working member of staff in getting me out the door. I'm doing some of the bloody work, so why am I paying as much as the guy being served by staff?

The problem with the packing you mentioned is your requirements there are in contradiction to the cost-savings they're doing in order to allow you to shop at those prices in the first place. Bringing in more staff would raise the costs. This is why I feel self-service checkouts (shitty as they are) would actually be a practical solution, even with trollies. 

I tell you what, the best self-service checkout experience I had was when the staff put it in a staff-only mode for me. In this mode, the till does not wait for you to bag items and then check their weight every time, and it lets you add and void stuff willy-nilly. It was fucking awesome, scanned everything instantly, no delay, really fast, I had a whole trolley scanned and packed and paid for in no time.

&gt;

&gt;The __1983 Football League Cup Final__ was a [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) match held on 26 March 1983 between [League Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup) holders [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.), who would go on to win the [FA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) later that year. Liverpool won the match 2–1; [Norman Whiteside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Whiteside) scored the opener for Manchester United, before [Alan Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kennedy) equalised with 15 minutes to go. The winner was scored in the 8th minute of extra-time by [Ronnie Whelan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Whelan).

&gt;Had Manchester United won the League Cup as well as the FA Cup that year, they would have become the first team ever to have won the two competitions in the same season. Instead, Liverpool won their third successive League Cup, and the second of three successive League and League Cup Doubles.

&gt;The match was played at [Wembley Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_(1923\)) in front of approximately 100,000 spectators.

So instead of saying ""why don't Israel just stop firing back"" why aren't people saying ""Maybe Hamas should stop firing missiles altogether, let alone from populated areas."" 


The Iron Dome will not be 100% effective, and letting people fire missiles at your country uncontested doesn't send a good message to anyone.

How would you feel if your country was being bombed and your government were just letting them get away with it because it might look bad if they retaliate?


To suggest Israel just let someone attack them is absolutely insane.

It does not mean the police can't investigate you, it does not mean the police can't talk to you, it does not mean the police can't put in place reasonable measures to prevent a crime occuring.

I really get your point, but the problem with it is it's based in a fantasy land where bad people don't exist, and when they do exist they go to court and go to prison. The vast majority of abusers will never go to court, let alone prison. Like I said, it's not a crime that is very easy to deal with with our justice system.

Even went to Paris and watched them in a bloody airport hangar once too. I have touched Matt Berninger!!! Who I had a bit of a crush on for, oh, three years. 

I'm also stropping a bit that I haven't sorted my life out enough to go to Rock en Seine or Pitchfork Paris this year - friends will be there and I will be jealous... esp if Sigur Ros are playing again (although I got quite irritated at all the talkers last time!). I haven't looked at the lineup because I'm crap at window shopping, I just get sulky :)

Next year will be better!

I love their music but I walked out of their last gig because it was pretentious performance art and I had a hangover, five inch heels on, and couldn't be doing with any of it. Especially as the man my former friend was seeing at the time turned up with his girlfriend and awkwardness ensued all round.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; A lot of fellas do that though love. Not all of them, but I've seen a fair few (and dated a few) where the minute you move in together, they virtually stop seeing their mates or organising things altogether. Which is pretty unhealthy if/when the relationship splits up and they realise they haven't bothered staying in touch with anyone who'd help them get through the relationship split! I'm not a fan of it, it's idle, it's lazy, and it's relying on one other person completely. 

Aye, I've seen it a tonne of times. 

This guy did it once before and promptly abandoned me on three times when I've really needed a friend. When I was at my lowest he was never there (I had no-one), when he needed me I've always been at his side, which is probably why it annoyed me in the past.

I think seeing him a weekend or so ago and realising that there was nothing behind his eyes but scorn and arrogance really changed my perception. No longer was I going to be bound by this person who was mentally holding me back, I was just going to turn my back, wish him a good life... but one that I do not want a place in.

My girlfriend turned round last night and said she was worried about me with it, I appreciated it. But I'm long past caring now, I realised that the guys and girls around me were far better friends than another.

Like you said, people grow apart... but some people don't grow, they just become hateful.

&gt; When I was about to leave my husband I had to get in touch with his brother to ask him to keep an eye on him (I knew he would be suicidal) because he had NO friends left. Nada. Not one that I could contact.

Ha. If think that's an insult then you've led a mercifully quiet life. It's an informal, humorous way of noting that you're behaving in a fractious, agitated manner.

&gt;the whole purpose of my original comment was that people on here can use whatever terms they want without getting insulted for it.

I never insulted anyone for using a different term. I just pointed out the correct one.

&gt;I never said ""like what I say or fuck off""

I was paraphrasing but, yes, you did. Telling me that I've no right to point out anything because 'this is an American site'. 

I'll say again, because you either didn't read my response or chose to ignore it:

This site is populated by people from all over the world. The free exchange of information is great, is it not? I mean, I've learned a lot from people all over the world regarding a whole host of things - because I've an open mind and I want to.

...the issue here is that many of the people getting their knickers in a twist **don't want to**, which is a negative trait that many people associate with a swathe of American society. You want in, but only if you can change something and have it **your** way.

&gt;You have an opinion, terrific, telling people what they should and should not do is however not an opinion ""By all means love the sport. Play it. Talk about it. But don't try and change it.""

Where in that statement did I *tell* people what to do? I gave **my** opinion and a bunch of entitled little irritants lost their shit.

I'll say this, and I won't say more once I'm done:

The sport comes from my land. It's part of my culture. Every Saturday for as long as I can remember I'd go the match with my Dad or uncles, it's part and parcel of life for most people here.

If you start Americanising it, talking about franchises, jerseys, dee-fence, and off-fence you're gonna rub people the wrong way. I'm stoked American people are starting to get into football. It's good for the sport. I just think you should be trying to be included, not chopping and changing things for your own comfort.

Broken leg, broken arm, three broken ribs and a punctured lung. He had the bloody cheek to get the police to call me to collect his stuff from whichever grotty bedsit he was staying at (literally a stone's throw from my flat, talk about a lazy ARSE) and I told them to call his brother. I think he was in hospital for a month or something.

&gt;People are fucking nuttier than squirrel shit aren't they?

Haha, they are indeed, and that really made me laugh :D. Well, he didn't want me to leave him. He'd spent the proceeding month (I gave him a deadline to get out) wandering around crying. So, it wasn't unexpected. Unfortunately for him he'd fucked me off beyond redemption and I gave no shits. Well, I called his brother to say 'I'm going to leave him and I think he'll be suicidal.' So that's enough of a shit given after seven years and a marriage to the most despicable yet charming man I have ever met, I think? I could've not warned his brother (whom he hadn't spoken to for two years) anyway.

&gt;and when I answered he'd be a condescending bastard about my life choices...

Such as what??

Jayzus, sounds like he did some serious harm.

My pop did that. When I bought him out of the house he went and rented just down the road for sake of 'familiarity'... fuck that for a game of soldiers.

&gt; Haha, they are indeed, and that really made me laugh :D. Well, he didn't want me to leave him. He'd spent the proceeding month (I gave him a deadline to get out) wandering around crying. So, it wasn't unexpected. Unfortunately for him he'd fucked me off beyond redemption and I gave no shits. Well, I called his brother to say 'I'm going to leave him and I think he'll be suicidal.' So that's enough of a shit given after seven years and a marriage to the most despicable yet charming man I have ever met, I think? I could've not warned his brother (whom he hadn't spoken to for two years) anyway.

Sounds like you did the good and honest thing and he was still an ass-clown. It really shows that people are just fucking nobheads regardless!

&gt; Such as what??

Oh if I was going out partying for three weekends straight in Holland he'd have something to say about it. Or if I was considering certain things he'd give his two pence and be THAT guy about it.

&gt; So, a spoilt brat. Uh huh. 

Yup. He's an arsehole to a lot of people who've tried to help him. His parents don't help though...

No plans! We've said we're going bike riding up to a local national park, going to have a picnic on the highest hill and smoke some Cohiba's and drink wine. That'll be a laugh!

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"You have to be shitting me. New Labour instituted some good policies- few now contest the value of the Minimum Wage, and the independence of the Bank of England still has many fans. But this really is at best a rose-filtered view, particularly now that we have the benefit of hindsight to examine the effect on policy and behaviours.

Under his premiership the constitution was utterly trashed as they made a hash of devolution (I am not saying there should not have been devolution, but certainly not in the incompetent manner in which is was executed). The political culture of the UK was harmed as spin in its modern sense poisoned the well- trust in the political system has never been lower, largely by the necessity of professional politicians in the post-spin era. Blair was the first PM to blur the line between political  and civil service in employing Alistair Campbell as a public servant, an unthinkable change before his time and one that has subsequently proven a cancer in UK politics. He fudged reform of the House of Lords, kicking the discussion for viable change back a generation. He also engaged as PM in overt corruption, granting contracts that were proposed for public tender privately to party donors including Lakshmi Mittal, Paul Drayson and the near £2bn awarded to Rod Aldridge's Capita after his donations to the party. Not forgetting either that Richard Desmond made a donation days before the DTI expedited and signed off his takeover bid for Express Newspapers, and Bernie Ecclestone's £1m. The inheritance of deliberately muddled Lords reform and party donations was the Cash for Honours scandal, the first of the thousand cuts that have rocked UK politics.

The underlying strength of the best economy ever inherited by a UK government was obliterated post-2000 by rampant house-prices that Brown specifically said his job was to avert as part of his famous 'no more boom and bust speech'. Even some of the strengths such as the empirically demonstrable improvements in the NHS and other services was achieved only through a strong economic inheritance that was all shagged out as the productivity of government spending fell by 16%, a huge drop. The economic trend of the growing economy followed one from 1982-2000, bar the early 90's recession and ERM. Brown even made a point of campaigning and then governing in his first three years as Chancellor by saying that New Labour would follow Conservative economic policy until 2000- it was part of a strategy to convince the electorate and investors of continuity following a change of government. So even though many have criticised others' assertion in this thread that Labour's first few years were not down to decisions they made it is evidently true that the economy was in rude health in 1997 and that economic policy barely shifted until the year 2000. It is not a coincidence that after this time the public debt grew quickly, even in an era of record yield in tax revenue, so even pre-2002 poor decisions were being made in economic policy.

I mean there are a thousand other things that could be said too about that era, this is just off the top of my head and I'm fiddle-arsing on my phone (and this is already a little insanely-long and rambling) be it the introduction of tuition fees, removing student grants, good days to bury bad news, the '99 Chicago speech ""Doctrine of International Community"" that was the foundation of destabilising the entire MENA region, undoing one of the only good things the Tories did and throwing away 20 years of improving the Penal system and keeping young offenders out of prison, throwing away the progress the Home Office were making following the work by Dr John Marx on drug addiction, and so much else. 

New Labour did institute some good policies, as noted, but competency is not a word I'd associate with them- the lasting structural damage that has rocked UK institutions, inequality issues, post-secondary education, security, a thousand things were somehow worsened even after decades of other poor governments. I think the view is rose tinted as it always becomes years later, just as when people get misty-eyed over Thatchers era. It's an effect that's amplified x1000 when you are dealing with a government as incompetent as the current one.

Distribution would thankfully be quite cheap, but the lead times on orders could be quite long unless we have a large initial batch made.

That said, if this is something that generates a lot of interest within the community, I will certainly make serious enquiries as to the viability of producing and distributing these and get back to you all with some concrete numbers on pricing and availability.

I'm single, and in a 2x bedroom house on a quiet street, I'm paying £500 for it in the Belmont Road area of East Belfast. I've got Virgin Media 120Mb/sec available and I think BT fibre as well. Mobile reception is decent for emergency backup with 3G as well. Theres plenty of good food available on the Upper Newtonards Road, good access to the Sydenham bypass and other A roads for getting to the Motorways, and 24hr tescos/petrol stations nearby for grabbing that emergency 3AM pint of milk.

If you want to pay £2000 thats up to you, but I'd say you can get something decent for £700, and there are plenty of good local furniture stores that would get you any additional furnishings delivered reasonably cheap (I had a bed delivered practically next day for £10 for instance)

Without making it a personal finance thread, I don't see the point in spending London Style money here - you won't get a london style lifestyle out of it and as hard as Belfast tries to pretend to be a big important expensive city sometimes it really isn't.

If you are still pulling that money when you are here, I'd really consider using the opportunity to make some overpayments in the pension pot, or get the deposits saved for some property before the prices start rising too much.

Yeah, maybe over a few generations. Not in one month, one year, or even ten years.

&gt;is it stupid beyond words to think that because people do something potentially dangerous that somehow makes it ok to want them to die

Let's look at the situation. To arrive in Calais, these men would have either walked through, or at least stopped off at multiple EU member states before arriving at the UK/French border. That means they've had multiple opportunities to claim asylum which, if successful, would give them immediate respite from whatever it is they're fleeing.

These are EU states we're talking about, not Banana Republics. Someone needs to explain to me why they aren't seeking asylum with their immediate neighbours, and then the neighbours to those neighbous (and so on). If you've failed to get asylum by the time you get to the UK, after passing through the whole EU, and then the UK rejects you asylum case, then I don't believe your claim to asylum.

So when these guys are jumping in the wagons of lorries in Calais, I can't see how they're doing it to seek asylum. I've seen the footage of North African refugees in sketchy rafts heading to Italy and Spain, and I think they have huge stones, and since the country they are directly coming from is a shithole, it makes it easier for me to believe their claim on the face of it.

So, to answer your question, if I think you're doing something without humanitarian merit, at the cost of working men, then yeah, I have little sympathy if you get hurt. I wouldn't go as far as to install traps, but I certainly would go as far as to not guarantee their safety.

*If* this is just about economic migration, then we can have that conversation: I want to see the border opened up to the whole world, on a merit-based system. The bar doesn't have to be particularly high, but I'd like to see trades and skills throttled according to demand and population growth control.

The rules are completely separate for a Junior ISA - so yes, there is a 'loophole' insofar that someone 16 or 17 can have a full 'normal' ISA and also a Junior ISA in the same tax year.

There are some rules - you cannot have a child trust fund, for example, and hold a Junior ISA (I believe).

£7.84ph isn't decent pay. It's far too low for the price of stuff today. It's not even a ""living wage"" which is £8.80 for london. (£7.65 in UK) (2013 figures)

 £10ph would be a decent minimum wage. £6.31 is not enough. People get tax-credits etc... because of minimum wage being so low. Tesco etc...are being essentially subsidized by tax payers. They get bigger profits while our taxes go to cover the mess they make by creating the hard working living poor.

£10ph minimum wage would give more people, more money to spend. Good for the economy and businesses. 

&gt;Tesco's pay isn't too bad

I strongly disagree.... society should expect more as a bare minimum. You are worth more than having to work hard just to scrape by and get into debt. You are worth more than £6.31ph.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"I looked at the twitter account she mentioned, and yup he's a bit of a troll (although I've yet to see good evidence he's a racist). However, pretty much every polemicist in the public eye receives such online mockery - I don't think it only happens to highly ideological feminist columnists.

Love him or loathe him, take Richard Dawkins as an example of another writer with controversial opinions.  Practically every single tweet he posts is met with trollish replies.  Do Guardian writers leap to his defense and weep bitter tears about our cruel culture of misatheism?  No, they do not.  Or what about the right of center writers who get accused of being literally hitler on a daily basis?  Nope, not a soupçon of sympathy.  In fact, come to think of it, the Guardian reacted with glee when Robin Thicke was recently pilloried on Twitter in an online AMA.  Huh.  I guess compassion is only for people we agree with.

Also- attacking ideological feminism is not the same thing as being a misogynist.  I think many of Penny's columns are richly deserving of mockery. Does that mean I must have an ingrained hatred of all women?  I hope not.  

Of course misogyny does occur online, but I also think that some feminist writers are too eager to play the victim and some even use it as a way to dodge honest criticism.  

Edit:  I'm happy for people to disagree with me, but I'm not happy that people resort so quickly to the downvote button in an attempt to punish anyone they disagree with.  If you think I'm wrong, then let me know.  Who knows?  Maybe you can change my mind.

Westminster feels like an alien world to me and im a 50 min train ride away god knows how it must feel to a man in Inverness or Aberdeen. if Scotland is finding itself increasingly at odds with england then they have to go their own way, i hate slamond but when I read his statements i find it hard to not agree with him, if Scotland doesn't want to spend 60 billion on weapons that have never been used but at the same time make them a 1st strike target then i would be angry having them forced on me too. If Scotland wants a more socialist state and to keep education and healthcare free then good luck to them i wish we had that attitude here. Of course the argument i know is that they cant afford it and salmond is making false promises but he says one thing and  the no campaign another, i don't know enough of the economics to pass judgement on that. 

I also think its fucking hypocritical that on the one hand our government is saying lets get out the EU it does nothing for us and at the same time trying to tell Scotland not to leave the union. 

i await the outcome with nervousness, i really really hope our country stays together and if it doesn't i will be fucking heart broken and Cameron should be given a a union flag a bottle of whiskey and a revolver, if that man does what napoleon and Hitler couldn't then he deserves to go down in history as the worst prime minister we've ever had.

Folders show previews of images these days, and files show up in ""recently opened"" history menus. I think some versions of Picasa would offer, by default, to index every image on the computer, and then show a screen full of thumbnails every time it was opened.

And yet in relation to this conflict you don't even follow ""better to let a murderer go free than execute a dozen innocent people.""

I'm trying to understand you.

Maybe you think it's okay to kill people who are guilty of trying to kill you, even if you could make it very difficult for them to kill you without killing them. If then you also think that most of the people killed aren't innocent, you could endorse Israel's attacks. But quite a lot of them are children, and you surely don't think they're guilty of firing rockets at Israel. So I don't think it can be just this.

Maybe you also add a thought that killing guilty people is in itself good, and it makes up for killing innocent people? Perhaps to kill ten rocketeers one may kill five innocent people. If you'd let the ten rocketeers live, they'd have killed two innocent people. But killing guilty people is good, and it makes up for the three deaths of innocent people.

Both of those involve moral premises I wouldn't accept, but taken together (with some facts I also disagree with) I can understand the logic as it applies to this situation.

Or perhaps you think that Israel can, by force, end the conflict and bring something like peace, but letting Hamas and Palestinians alike thrive would result in Hamas finding better ways to kill Israelis than they currently have, causing more innocent deaths than are caused by Israel's actions.

There I would understand the logic, and just differ on my perception of facts.

Please set aside your upset at the unfairness of the situation, or at the way people see Israel as the villain, and Hamas as good, and stop mentioning that kind of thing. It's true that I don't quite understand your moral code yet, but I'm sure it can't involve balancing the deaths of innocent people against anger at outsiders' unfair views.

true,jgms,newcr-1,"Kompany, Hummels, Silva, Stones.","Seems to me that he's already on Mourinho's bad side, which is a hard thing to knock. He was there for the first few games at Chelsea last year and took a spot behind Eto'o, Torres and Ba as a striker. And then there were the strange comments between the two of them during the year where Lukaku was insinuating that Chelsea didnt really seem to care about his time on loan and Mou shot back.

I think that Mou would let him leave before he goes to preseason with Chelsea, he wouldn't try to block a move if Lukaku decided he wanted out. We know he doesnt rate Lukaku highly already and we also know just how much Lukaku thinks of himself. Lukaku on the bench at Chelsea just doesn't seem like a good fit given everything thats been said.

Honestly I'm just speculating, Mourinho could love him for all I know, but the evidence at hand suggests that Mourinho doesn't think too highly of him, and Lukaku wants to go to a club where he can play. Given that Juventus, the last of the Champions League teams interested in Lukaku just signed Morata, it leaves him with few options. Just us, Chelsea and Wolfsburg with offers on the table. I dont expect him to pick us but all the same I'll be surprised if he stays at Chelsea.

He seems as though he is a player with no filter, some of the comments he made about Anelka (and a few other times that I can't remember) were ill-considered, and I imagine he could be quite impulsive. 

I remember one quote from Mourine along the lines of 'He knows exactly why he is on loan, you will have to ask him', which suggests there is more to it that a pure player development/ strategic move. 

That being said, I feel Lukaku and Chelsea are happy to sit it out and wait for an offer that suits them both. Lukaku knows that he is an in demand commodity, and Chelsea know that if the worst comes to the worst they can always loan him out for a fee again.

true,sad_violin,lfc12,,"So we are not a force to be reckoned with? How does Lallana's arrival not do the exact same thing for us in the eyes of Arsenal fans? Arsenal have way more money than we do. We can't prop the squad up on academy graduates and splash a lot of cash once or twice a window. The wage bill won't allow for it. Instead, the system we play will produce stars so that we don't end up paying out the ass both in terms of wage and fee. I agree that bringing in Khedira would help the midfield, but it's economically unfeasible and there are much less obvious ways in which the squad is improving day by day. 

Also, if by ""nobody"" you mean the author of the article, then yeah, you didn't really read the article. By accusing LFC of not getting a big name, the author is disregarding Lallana's purchase. Homeboy is gonna be world fucking class. 

We don't play ball the way we do. This isn't Fifa. Those big names coming into squads also require a serious restructuring of tactics and squad dynamics that take a long while to get straightened out. The system makes the players, but also the players do have to make the system as well. You will see a generation of highly sought after stars be produced by Liverpool in the coming years. The purchasing of marquees prevents their development. 

Frankly, fuck it. I don't need instant gratification, I'm looking forward to watching the squad grow over the next few seasons with Rogers.

All you ever see is little tributes to the Palestinian people who are facing fire *because of Hamas*. They are caught up in it and put in danger because of Hamas attacking an ultimately superior military force. You're saying Israel should just get attacked? Like their actions are the only ones responsible for the deaths of innocent people? 

Why are you so bent on ""understanding my moral code"" like that's what's in question with the whole conflict? or is my moral code going to change the mind of those in power in Israel or at Hamas?

These are posts linking to Hamas attacking their *own country and killing their own civilians* because they are shite at being a military force, and you think Israel should just get shot at because fuck it, it isn't hurting them *even if it is drastically hurting Palestine*?

Israel taking action. Tremendous violent action at most, completely irradicating Hamas would at the very worst let Palestinian people go on living their lives, and those in Israel go on living their lives. 

Israel just getting shot at (Which i'm not sure why you think this is so great) and using the Iron Dome isn't always effective. Not only does it not completely protect them but it doesn't do anything about the fact that Hamas are still firing their bombs and hitting Israel *and* palestine.


Your whole thing of trying to look somehow morally superior with the ""letting guilty go free"" bullshit simply does not apply in this conflict. Both sides have factored in that Innocent people will suffer, no matter what (unless theres a truce which we know Hamas doesn't want), but there will be less innocent lives lost, and less colateral damage, and a nearer end to this conflict if Israel is successful in their incursion into Gaza.

true,imdrinkingteaatwork,lfc99,null,"&gt; It's calling the majority, who are heterosexual, homosexual because they care about how attractive the team are.

It's not homosexual to find someone attractive.  Homosexuality has to do with sexual attraction and sexual intimacy, not thinking someone is good looking.

&gt; It's not slagging gays off in any way, it's saying that some people are acting contrary to the sexual preferences.

It is though.  It is saying that thinking men are attractive as males is wrong/different.  This doesn't have to do with sexual reference at all.  You can think a person of the same sex is attractive and not be a homosexual.

&gt;  You know what does stand in the way of true progress? Being an insufferable twat who always acts like society is out to get them.

Definitely not doing that.  I don't think anyone is out to get me.  I just think more people should be conscious of the damage their implicit bigotry does

&gt; Is it homophobic ( which mind you is a stupid term since not many people are scared of homosexuals) to call someone gay because they're acting gay?

It is homophobic if the implication is that however they are acting is wrong or somehow not acceptable.  And i don't think the word is dumb, it is a bit naive to think you have to be directly scared of homosexuals to think their is some sort of underlying fear, fear of change perhaps?

&gt; Playing the gay card does not give you free reign to act like a prick.

Who's playing the gay card?  Who's acting like a prick?

&gt; People being incredibly sensitive to a subject and easily offended makes me side against them

What a narrow view.  Maybe you should look at yourself a bit instead of just thinking everyone else is wrong.  Why should the people hurt by your words have to change?

&gt; The sad thing is its the stupid minority which is the stereotype. 

Yes.  It is the minority who understand that implicit bigotry causes a lot of damage and leads to  the acceptance of explicit bigotry.  That is the problem.  I really don't understand how people can be so selfish.  Your words hurt people, both implicitly and explicitly, but it is they who need to change?  Seems extremely backwards.

&gt;  I believe that putting someone on a pedastal is demeaning and not letting them be equals, you treat them like they aren't part of society.

That's quite an assumption you've got there.  Who exactly is being put on a pedestal?  Where am I saying anyone is any better?  I'm just saying don't propagate the notion that homosexuality is against the norm or something to laugh at.

&gt; Equality should entitle them to have jokes about their sexuality, much like the rest of society has joked about their demographic.

I hope you're not serious.  You're literally saying homosexuality is a joke.  So much so that even homosexuals should joke about it.  It's sad if you don't understand how hurtful that can be to so many people, even if you don't intend it to be.

Why? I know people ask about it on reddit a lot, but most American households (nearly 75%) have cable TV or satellite, which means they can watch every single LFC game legitimately on television. And why the hell would anyone choose a shitty 240p stream over HDTV? With the exception of the preseason games, most American LFC fans watch games on television

&gt;haven't been to a game in their life 

This is an interesting thing to say at a time when LFC is in the United States. Have you *seen* the number of posts on here about tickets? And do you have any idea how *far* some people are traveling just to watch LFC play in a friendly?

Why would Americans be any less likely to own genuine merchandise than anyone else?

Like most American fans, I've spent hundreds of dollars on official merchandise, and yes, I have a few knock-off items as well. Why?

and

&gt; Israel just getting shot at (Which i'm not sure why you think this is so great)

when I've tried to make it clear that I think both sides are doing bad things, and should stop. We both agree that Hamas should stop, so there isn't anything interesting to be said there, which is why we're rather arguing about what we think Israel should do.

But I think maybe I'm closer to understanding you now, because you don't seem to like ""killing guilty people is good in itself"".

Rather you say

&gt; there will be less innocent lives lost, and less colateral damage, and a nearer end to this conflict if Israel is successful in their incursion into Gaza. 

But do you think that 300 people will be killed by Hamas rockets between now and the next Israeli incursion, in a few years perhaps? 

28 people have been killed by Hamas rockets since 2001. Do you think that less than even 28 of the Palestinians killed in the past weeks were innocent? 

One of the posts you linked to is skeptical of the figure of 119 women/children/elderly dead so far. Do you think the figures are so falsely reported as to make the real number of women/children/elderly dead less than 28?

You don't have to type out any long paragraphs if you don't want to. You could just give yes or no answers to those three questions.

If you like historical stuff, Carlisle, the only city in Cumbria and largest population centre (although it's tiny compared to Glasgow) has a large castle and the Tullie house museum and art gallery which has a load of stuff on the history of the borders. Near Carlisle, there's also a lot of Roman stuff, such as Birdoswald Roman fort and parts of Hadrian's wall. If you like Roman stuff, there's allsorts running along Hadrian's wall between Carlisle and Newcastle. Carlisle is an easy train journey from Glasgow. There's a ruined castle in Egremont, further into west Cumbria, but I wouldn't say it is worth a visit. Whitehaven though (my home town) is a bit shit, but it is linked by train and was a major maritime port in it's heyday (the founder of the American navy trained in Whitehaven) so it has museums on maritime trade throughout the last 400 odd years and on mining, which could be interesting if you like that kind of thing.

CB carries more responsibility then RB/LB, granted not much more, but there is more on their shoulders. A mistake is the end for them.

It's like talking to a brick wall that doesn't know it's own stance.


It's as simple as this. 

Hamas are bombing Israel. they are shit with weapons and are also accidentally bombing themselves. They are also intentionally bombing parts of Gaza in order to fight the IDF and then pegging any civilian deaths they cause *on the IDF*. They are launching attacks from schools, nurseries, hospitals, densely populated civilian areas (when there are plenty of open lands for them to not draw fire to these areas.) And they're trumping up their figures to make it out like it's Israel doing the killing. *They are using the people they think they represent (which they don't) as human shields.*


Israel is attacking Hamas and there is some civilian loss as colateral, but it's extremely limited in comparison, but no less tragic.


Whilst both sides are extremely sketchy, to question Israels morality when they march into Gaza to directly face Hamas (as opposed to just bombing the afore mentioned places they love to set up camp) there is the chance that there could be civilian loss (even if it's caused by Hamas bombing Gaza) but that is something the world will have to deal with. 

The only reason something as horrible as civilian death is something people will have to deal with is because Hamas has fucked off the treaties, carried on attacking Israel and inadvertently Palestine and they have 100% forced Israel's hand in taking action. 



It's simple logic. don't attack everyone and expect to get away with it. If it were the UK in Israels situation, every single fucker in the country would be crying for the government to go into the enemies land and route the fuckers out. 

People that question Israels position in this at the current moment are simply trying to look morally superior *at the expense of the lives of many people in many places that just want peace*. 

If you want to look good, feed a homeless person or stroke a dog. Don't jump on the ""we hate Israel"" bandwagon because the only thing it serves to do is to make you all look stupid.

I can't see Soldado going - he's got great pedigree and suffered some personal trauma (miscarriage) that would have definitely affected his confidence in a new country on top of the pressure. He seems to be integrating well in the team now and also came in for big money (apparently a lot of add-ons though) and is arguably at his Peak, he won't gain value and he's coming of a very medicore season so nobody will make an offer Levy will take. Not that I think he deserves to be sold or should.

Ade...problem with Ade is the dude relies on being a starter. He can produce the goods and is a great Prem stiker that sometimes makes me think I'm watching someone World Class. Problem is, he's also hit/passing his peak now and man, I don't think he's consistent enough. It's tough because he would be a great option in a similar mold to Bony if Soldado just never finds his feet. But if Bony &amp; Ade are away for the AFCON, Kane wouldn't be enough. 

Man, I'm more confused now than I was before. I think if Bony is in, we should sell Ade. If he's playing a heavy rotation role, which he'll have to if he stays, I don't think he's a player that will produce unless he's getting a run of games and *feels* the main man.

If someone has been accused twice and pulled the consent defence twice, being cleared; there's an element of there being no smoke without fire.

He's already been cleared of the two, which lets be honest are ""warning signs"" the police ""should have seen"" in the eyes of the tabloid press when he goes and kills the third, future one. This is what the police are faced with; this is the ""more"" they ""should have done"" and they are doing it.

If you're someone who sails close to the wind where consent and drunk girlies are concerned, a shot across the bows in the form of a doorstep visit may make you think twice.
It's a largely unquantifiable statistic, but it's invariably going to prevent offences.

I saw a car driving around one night on duty, wasn't happy with the fact the solo male occupant was doing laps of the town slowly, so stopped it. Chap says he's looking for a friend he's supposedly picking up, whatever, he goes on his way, no crime committed and I'm none the wiser, with no suspicion really.  Anyway, 9-10 months go by and I get a call at home from some random DCI, asking why I'd checked this guys car on the night. It transpires he'd just been nicked for a stranger rape, same MO, same area, hence their interest.

I'm really sorry, but you can't just talk to your father about this, because you can't trust him. 

If you go to him with your concerns, then you have to assume that anything he says in reply is a lie.

If your father had wanted to be honest with you, he could have come to you with a deal in the first place, when he set this thing up - he could have said ""I want you to own this company, and I'll run it for you"". He didn't, maybe be he knew what you'd say. Instead he did something dodgy, and you can't expect him to go straight now (he may not even be able to extricate himself from this mess).

Your father has done something illegal - if you don't go to the plod, you risk making yourself accomplice.

I suspect you already have a nasty feeling in your guts, because you know already that what I'm saying is true.

If he stays healthy and continues the way he is playing (which it looks like he will be) you will easily win that bet. 

The fact that Ramires probably won't be competing with Matic for a spot much helps a lot. If we play 4-3-3 or a narrow 4-1-2-1-2, he will fight against Oscar/Cesc/Willian. If we play the 4-2-3-1 or 4-2-2-2 he will fight against Cesc/Van Ginkel (or start alongside Matic). Only people competing directly with Matic are Mikel and Van Ginkel.

So's Newcastle, though the castle/city walls are quite destroyed - near Chinatown tho, so lots of good food. Depending on the time you visit, the Life museum and Hancock museum may have an exhibition that interests you. 

Edinburgh has really nice medieval/historic things to do, as does York. York has a pretty cool viking museum called Jorvik, my friends from Northern Germany loved it when they went the other week, but I can only vouch for it like 10yrs ago which was the last time I went. 

Bamburgh Castle isn't a long drive from Durham really, so I imagine you could find a way there. Aesthetically it is really good imo, the surrounding area is fun to explore and quite dynamic! Something about the castle that just makes it really good to explore/etc imo. 

The Lake District is a must-see, idk about rail access as we've only ever driven there from Durham. 

Metro Centre isn't as good as it used to be, but I still enjoy walking about as you never really see stuff like it around here (Newcastle City Centre is still the best for shopping atm imo).

This means that Lukaku would become our 2nd choice (After Costa) and Drogba will be there to tell them how to be a striker in the EPL and jump in if someone is injured, Also with the FA cup and CL It'd be good to have such an established player.

The thing is, Drogba isn't just a random 36 year old Striker, He's one of the best Forwards the world has ever seen. He'll probably only come on with less than 30 mins to play and we need a goal or 2.

Remy is going to be on a lot lot more than we pay Borini, but we don't know how much more yet. There's certainty there that he'll be on higher wages, which means there's not a direct ""6mill earned"". There's no certainty on how much we will be paying him though or how long his contract will be, so there's no way of knowing how much money we've saved, if any.

Of course it does. We fought war against Germany and Japan. Shit, we even used nuclear weapons in Japan twice. Now they are trusted allies. They have managed to move on. So have we. Yet the Middle East is still a shit hole. Of course time lessens things. The Middle East has had ample time to get their shit together. 


&gt;After 9/11 i thought no one could still be this dumb. When terrorism and extremism is allowed to propagate and thrive, no matter where you live its your problem. 

You are contradicting yourself. You say that we caused the problems by interfering, but when I say we should leave them alone, that is also wrong? We can't stop terrorism thriving because anything we do just makes things worse. 

One reason these dickheads hate us is BECAUSE of our constant interference. They want to be left alone, so let's just leave them. If they want to go door to door killing each other because they believe different fairy tales, that's fine by me. They're a lost cause as far as I'm concerned. But if they step out of line and attack the UK or our allies, we stamp them back down like the shit they are. 

&gt;Many of the problems we have at home (freedom of information, mass surveillance, extremism and terrorism) can be linked to the things we did in the middle east.

All the more reason to stop doing anything. 

We should develop alternate energy sources. Then we don't need the Middle East at all and they can all die for all I care. 

As for our domestic policy, it's time to start being more ruthless. Deport any cunts involved in terrorism, and simply close any visa agreements with those countries. Require every single person from the Middle East to go through extensive checks before coming to the UK.

'Echo of Glory' is also a key to this season's kits, which commemorate the 10 year anniversary of Bill's passing.

Exactly what you suggest was done in Lebanon: Israel withdrew and the UN was supposed to be in charge of ensuring Hezbollah didn't cause any mischief. Instead, the UN stood by while Hezbollah amassed tens of thousands of long range missiles and then started a new war with Israel a few years later.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"From a financial standpoint, absolute flop. After 3 years he's cost us more than a million pounds per goal from his 50 million transfer...not to mention his enormous wages. Normally it's not something we should concern ourselves with, but due to the club's commitment towards remaining FFP compliant his transfer has directly prevented us from moving on and replacing him with another big-ticket striker until now.

From a performance standpoint, still disappointing. In my opinion, it's fair to compare his form here to his form at Liverpool, and it's easy to see how far from grace he's fallen. He's not met the high standards that he himself set, which he openly admits. He hasn't been completely useless, and has had some nice moments. However, that's not enough to justify the playing time he's gotten at our club. 

From now on I don't really mind having him around; Jose has another big money player in Costa which means he won't be pressured to have Torres start games. The best thing for everyone, though, would probably be for Torres to leave. It would free up a roster spot, take his wages off the books, and give Torres a chance to get back in form somewhere away from his troubles before he really starts declining (he is 30 after all).

true,ctni,null,null,"If you want working from home and/or the big money coming from CompSci you pretty much need to move into freelancing/contracting. But even then some clients insist you work on-site in the shittiest of places for most of the period of the contract. There are other downsides too - no sick pay, no benefits, sometimes long gaps in between work, you've to sort your own pension.

Some consultancy gigs also have a decent work from home element, but again, you can wind up stuck in some industrial estate in the middle of nowhere for months on end depending on the client/project (and the programming work is generally nil). I was contacted by an England based firm who offered over double my current salary to do on-site consultancy work for them for clients in the area I specialise in (which would mean I could still base myself in Belfast and just fly over when/where needed - and there could be significant 'bench time' between projects). If I wasn't recovering from major surgery at the time I'd have taken it.

I can't remember the exact details, but a friend told me of a co-worker who was at a senior developer/technical architect level, wound up getting hired by a firm in America due to the expertise he had in some particular area (I think it was scalable enterprise web services). Works from home in NI, for the most part, flies over for the odd week, and due to the time difference he can push most of his work until the evening.

And with some areas of expertise, you can wind up so valuable/irreplaceable to a company that you can basically start asking for better pay and more favourable working conditions. Good data scientists seem to be in demand at the moment.

You won't get there automatically, but it isn't unheard of, and is something you can make the right moves towards - although if you want flexibility you need to be somewhat flexible yourself, be improving yourself constantly and take whatever openings arise.

One thing though - your CompSci degree becomes mostly worthless very quickly. If you get a good one (1st or a 2.1), you've got a chance to use it to get into the Graduate schemes of e.g. Accenture which are a good start. But a year or two in, forget about it. It's a combination of the results you've got with the work you've done, what you know and who you know after that. There are people who came out with thirds and desmonds who catapulted way ahead of me in payscale a few years in because they got the right knowledge in specific technologies (e.g. iOS, Data Science) at the right time. Or they found out they were shitty developers but half decent project managers, and had a wide enough professional network that they found someone willing to recommend them for a post in their place.

(Although none of that is to say you can't have a good career and a comfortable life in the Northbrooks and Liberties, but if you want the 'big money' and/or a more independent/work from home lifestyle, from what I've seen you'll generally have to think outside those.

I'm shocked I've found myself thinking Eccleston's Number 9 is my favorite doctor (I thought nobody could do a better Doc than Matt S; now I like them all, but 9 is my favorite. Martha's my favorite companion (go figure!). And while I haven't seen all the (reboot) episodes yet (missing a few specials and a few of S2 of the reboot), **Dalek** with #9/Rose ranks high for me. I just love ""EX-TER-MIN-ATE""!

But best? I think because I watched them backwards, I screamed with joy when **Aliens of London** and **WWIII** came on because Harriet Jones' origins, Eccleston's doctor portrayal, and Rose were all pure joy for me. It's got to be my #1.

But then of course **Stolen Earth** ranks up there, too (more Harriet, Rose with her weapon and ""wanna trade"" from Donna's dad. ♥) Easy Top 5 favorite. (But I get mixed up on the timeline parts in Journey's End. I haven't seen one of those specials from that ""off year"" so maybe it'll seem better later on?) But I'm a sucker for the ""all stars"" episodes like this one (Harriet, Rose, Martha, Capt Jack, etc).

Actually, Stolen Earth *would* be my favorite if Eccleston was in it, probably.

I'm still not 100% on what is continuity for him and what isn't. When 10 met Wilfred in that diner and Wilfred was like (not actual dialogue) ""Why are you so scared to die? Didn't you say you could regenerate?"" and 10 says something like ""It's different, a bunch of stuff changes, and in the end it's like another man walking away in your body.""

The look on his face is helpless, like he was John Cusack's character at the end of Being John Malkovich, locked inside a head, can't influence anything, permitted only to view.

They behave superficially so different, except that it's always a little alien, abstract, strange, and of course the faces are different. But if any of them were next to each other talking and were presented to you as different people, you'd never go ""You guys are both alike because of such and such.""

We're told he's the same guy, so we accept it, because we have to, because it's an important part of the narrative. There's very little holding it together, minus the shared memories, really.

Just imagine an 11 scene with 10 doing it, and some of them are so far off they just don't jibe. And they shouldn't. Even if it was still 10, never turning into 11, he is still a person (even if he's an alien person) so he'll learn and mature, etc.

But even their tastes (food and otherwise) change. It's a name, and a birth date, and a future death date. That's the connection.
