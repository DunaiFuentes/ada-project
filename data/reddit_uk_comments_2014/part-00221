**But** if you really want a brush like that, I recommend either splurging/saving up for the Hakuhodo or Rae morris. There's no point in buying a cheap knock off that only looks similar but hasn't got the brush qualities for the job (you'll just end up not using it) or one you can see yourself using now, but as you progress and want to downsize your collection/ have a set of products that are perfect for their intended tasks/for your skin etc [i.e. holy grail], you'll have to fork out the money to upgrade it to something of a better quality. 



Lastly, the Nars brush is scratchy and the quality isn't equal to the price. 



It's up to you what you do. It's just a piece of advice I wish someone had told me last year and each year before that. [Personally, I'm using what I have and waiting to downsize my collection before buying some Hak brushes]

We had to work our asses off to find the right manager and the right players. So far we have the right manager. He's different than the others. He changed the way people look at Liverpool FC.

The elite players, unfortunately, only come with success or second best. We cannot beat Chelsea, City, United, etc. at their own game. Dauntingly, we have to create a new way to get around them. And we've seen that last season. Without the consistent high stakes gambling of super players every window, we found a way to almost win the title. Think about it; the way Chelsea etc. do business is reckless and in many ways unfair. But would you really want some billionaire to pour his money into our squad like theirs? I don't like it one bit. 

The fact is that only with a title win or CL success will we be able to pick from the best players in the world. We are just outside that realm and with different constraints. But I think Brendan and FSG value prudence over pzazz. This will all take time. Another good season and we could be there. The Reus' and Vidal's and Isco's could become feasible.

true,imdrinkingteaatwork,lfc99,null,"&gt;How are you in a position to determine how happy anyone is..?

You took happy literally.  The way happy was implied was that there support --as in their own style-- was not sufficient so they had to borrow from others.  They were not happy with their level of support so they chose to imitate others.  Yes imitation is the highest form of flattery, but to some degree it becomes devoid of meaning because the sentiment behind the action has been lost.  

&gt; 'Moving on' sort of amounts to not responding to the question. Doesn't make what you said any more reasonable, accurate or correct.

What he heck?  I said I moved on because I admitted I was wrong about the usage of the phrase.  As in why aren't you moving on from that point as well?  As in you were right and I was wrong why do you feel the need to mention again?  I didn't answer the question because it falls back on things I said to which I have already recanted...

&gt; You, again, are making this determination of people 'pretending to be something they're not'. You are alone in this opinion. It is supported by 0% fact. Understand this, please.

And you don't think you are condescending? 

You're original comment on the matter was:

&gt; you're the only one making the distinction that there's a difference between American supporters and local ones.

You are kidding yourself if you think there is no difference between American supporters and local ones.  Like I don't know how you are even saying that.  And then to say I am the only one that thinks that?  In this thread maybe, but search any thread and you will find opinions like and even more extreme than mine.  You are LITERALLY ignoring everything about Liverpudlian culture that goes into the local support.  Next your going to tell me an American's hatred fro rival clubs is the same or how they became a supporter in the first place is the same.  They.  Are.  Different.  Not worse.  Different.

""Pretending to be something they're not"" may be a bit harsh, but it is make pretend to some degree.  No one is saying they have no rights to be fans, but the context behind why Liverpool supporters do what they do is going to be lost.  Why they sing the songs they sing.  Why they hate the things they hate.  It's always going to be borrowed without the connection.  Because however global the club might be, their history is rooted in the actual city.

***Side note***: and I did not want to bring this up, but I hope you know how difficult you have made this by not quoting a single thing I've said when you type out your retort.  I have no idea what you are talking about each time, so not only do I have to read what you said; I now have to go back to what I said to gather the context.

&gt; Again, just stating that something isn't true and offering an opinion on my personality offers absolutely no explanation for how you arrived at this point.

Wow.  You are a tad frustrating.  I have said several times, in several places how there is more than just geographical differences.  I mentioned above the cultural differences.  I'm sorry, but repeating yself over and over to you has become tiresome.

&gt; I'm not arguing for sameness of culture, but you're talking about people, these people's intentions and insisting that they're less happy and are out to copy others.

Refer to what I said about what [I thought] was implied with ""happy"".  You are missing SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much nuance in this discussion.  Here you are thinking  I am saying these people are unhappy and explicitly copying others because of it.  You are really hard to discuss with.  I'm saying, their level of support (from a distance, their own chants, etc) is not sufficient SO THEY mimic what the home crowd does.  That is important to note too.  In America, in Indonesia, in Australia, the home crowd is not present.  These are exhibition games.  They are LITERALLY being exhibited to the world.  Many of the fans have taken up the traditions OF THE HOME CROWD, but that does not and wil never make them the home crowd.

&gt; This is delusional and doesn't need disproving because neither I nor you are in a position to determine that regarding people we don't know. 

I don't think so.  I think what I said is easy to prove, just you misconstrued ENTIRELY what I was saying.  And before you say ""just saying that it is easy to prove is not proving anything,"" I feel like I proved it in the paragraph above.

&gt; I disagree, because I'm criticizing them with excessive fact and example in addition to my opinion. You're, in the majority of these cases, are just saying I'm wrong and that what your opinion is, is.

I have no idea what this in reference to.  Like at all.

&gt; I bring it up only in response to you exemplifying that despite acknowledging this, your argument stems from the same opinions that you've already agreed are incorrect.

That is cuckoo.  My argument does not stem from the same opinions.  My initial argument was that the traveling Kop was much more literal.  All the rest of my opinions are about cultural appropriation.

&gt;Yes, it is, but the topic isn't our difference of opinions, it's you insisting that yours is correct and mine is not. You're comparing our opinions like they are facts, but only one of us is offering any sort of fact. I'm also the only one really making comparisons to other things that are identical in their point's basis, where you are generalizing - which is the wrong thing to do in almost every case. In this case, when you're talking about the specific emotions of people, the reasons they do things and how they want to be viewed (not how they are viewed, but how they in their own minds would prefer to be viewed, something which is unique to the individual and cannot be generalized), it offers very little to anything to think that you're in a position to do so.

I don't recall you offering much in the line of fact.  And the generalizations I am making aren't the evil you are making them out to be.  They leave plenty of room for alternatives as they admit they are generalizations.  I am talking about American fans in respect to their fandom.  All American fans are American.  That is no generalization.  All American fans are not Liverpudlian fans.  That is a tad of a generalization but only if we talk about dual citizenship, which reaches a grey area when you tak about Cultural identity.  Can you identify as both?  Well if you do, something has to be lost from one side or the other, because some of the culturalisms require singularity.  I am not taking about the individual emotions of people I am talking about implicit tendencies liek doing what the other fans do because of x.  The reasoning there is a generalization, but then again I am only really talking about the generalized people.  And I am talking about EXTREMELY broad concepts in relation to the supporters, which caaaaaaaaaaaan be generalized.  I am not talking about specific individuals and their EXACT life history in regards to all decisions regarding their Liverpool support.  The broad things are like why they do the things that originate in Liverpool.  A fairly adequate assumption (though ADMITTEDLY a generalization because not EVERYONE would) would be that they do these things to be like their Liverpudlian counterparts or that they think it is what they are supposed to do.  I am not saying this is always the case.  In fact, I am only saying always when it is things that have to have a clear cut distinction one way or the other, like being from Liverpool or anywhere else, having A Liverpudlian culture or any other kind.

&gt; If you're not clinging to that, I fail to see what points you're bringing to the table anymore, other than just picking apart my replies line by line to disagree with them.

This is condescension.  I am going line by line so my rebuttals have context.  It's necessary for any discussion.

&gt; You stated your perverse generalized opinion of American culture.

You missed the nuance of the generalizations, hope I clarified, but how on Earth is it perverse?

&gt; An appeal to public opinion is an attempt to see you cast even a shred of doubt in how you're forming these opinions.

What exactly am I supposed to be doubting?  Should I doubt my opinion that an American supporter cannot know the context of Liverpool FC's history from they perspective of a Liverpudlian having never experienced it from that perspective?  Because that is what this boils down to.  WHy should I doubt that?  Why should I doubt that that makes them **DIFFERENT** kinds of supporters?

&gt; Much of what you're telling me are things one simply cannot know, let alone use to support an argument based on generalizations and opinion.

I really hope I cleared this up at least a little bit.

&gt; . [in reference to my generalizations] I don't know why, and I don't know why you find that it serves as any sort of evidence to support your opinions.

Really hope I made this clear.

&gt;  Generalizations like those which you've made are part of the reason why American soccer culture is the way that it is.  It's always easier to generalize, and obviously depending on the topic at hand, almost always extremely inaccurate. 

Maybe expand on that a bit more.  I don't believe you; I think America's soccer culture problems run deeper, but I am inclined to listen.

&gt; The difference is, my generalization is actually accurate and I say it based on the wealth of info/cases out there which are readily accessible to all. Like I said, google some images.

Quite the double standard.  Again, I hope I cleared up  the veracity of my generalizations above.

&gt; The whole concept of support is about embracing something, and when people link arms to do it together..it's generally approved of and the preferred behavior.

Never am I not approving or inferring others should not approve.  I am simply, as I have been the whole time, saying the supports are inherently different.

&gt;  I think there are a lot of people who would be very upset to hear the opinions you've offered here and would prefer not to be associated with you as a result of it.

Damn.

&gt; The most minor example of this is the up and downvotes throughout our discussion.

Not a very scientific measurement, no?

&gt;  Notice all of your negative votes. People clearly disagree with you.

A downvote means a disagreement always.  Never strays from that.  Be it ignorance or maybe me not stating my case well, I will take their ""disagreements"" with a grain of salt.

&gt; You're basically flipping them all off saying ""nope."" You're entitled to your opinion, of course, but when it's sort of blatantly just..incorrect..you have to eventually doubt it. 

**There is LITERALLY nothing incorrect in saying, which I have been saying since nearly the very beginning, that non-Liverpudlian supporters are not the same (NOTE: never here am I saying better or worse) as Liverpudlian supporters in more ways than just their geography.**

&gt; You're basically flipping them all off saying ""nope.""

I touched back on this because it is so condescending.  If I was just flipping them off and saying ""nope"" I wouldn't be going to great lengths to discuss the topic.

&gt; If we're both Americans, how can you tell me that I'm oblivious to how American's are perceived because I'm American..if you're American and talking about how we're perceived. I mean, wtf.  You can't go explaining something to someone you say doesn't get it because of qualities you share

Wow.  I'm not saying you don't get it BECAUSE you are an American.  I am saying it is a common American tendency to gloss over the sentiments of others.  Accidental xenophobia if you will.  It is so common in our country (so many not seeing anything wrong with or even justifying the National anthem at EVERY EVENT EVER as an example) to view our traditions as the only traditions, and never even trying to empathize with how others may view us.  It goes hand in hand with the idea of ""American exceptionalism"" we are always hearing.

&gt; Also, you have no idea if I'm born and raised abroad and living here now.

You are absolutely correct.  That was a definite assumption on my part.

&gt; But that doesn't stop you from not implying but directly telling me that I am a bit oblivious. 

I did say ""I think"" and if that does not admit fault for any and all assumptions, I don't know what does.

&gt; Again, calling me naive? It was an example of how I would feel about foreign support for my local club.  It's not about whether or not RBNY would actually get to the level that Liverpool is, in terms of support.

Come on.  Seriously come on.  You ARE being naive if you think over 100 years more of being a club wouldn't change some things about how you felt about other support.  Or that being raised in an ABSOLUTELY foreign culture wouldn't change things either.  COME ON!!!!!!  American's views of foreign support is different from foreign views of American support.  You HAAAAAAAAAAAAVE to get that?

&gt; The fact that you missed this one is sort of appalling, and further speaks on behalf of the view that you seem to be here more to stick it to people than to offer anything else.

What??? HOW!?!?!?!  Who am I trying to stick it to?  What are you talking about???

&gt; You've made it extremely clear that you're very comfortable talking about things you know nothing about.

Again... what do I know nothing about?  Do I not know that America and England have different cultures?  Do I not know that Liverpool and America are different places?  In regards to my points, WHAT DO I NOT KNOW!?!?!?!

&gt; You seem to think you have all the answers, even when they're about what goes on inside the heads of complete strangers, myself included.

I may have deduced a lot on a few assumptions, bt i feel like I did a pretty good job of admitting when and where.

&gt; You're not using my words to accurately respond to my words, at this point, you're just trying to say what things 'are' and leave very little (read: no) room for you potentially not knowing wtf you're talking about.

I don't understand what you are saying here...

&gt; The sheer fact that it has to be explained to you that you can't say ""they do that because they're not as happy' or that these people are pretending to be something..speaks on behalf of whether or not I'm talking to a rational person here.

I hope you realize I was using happy as ""being sufficient"".  I am confused as to why you took it so literally.  As for pretending, isn't it?  At least to some degree?  If so much of the home support reflects home tradition wouldn't mimicking that be at least implicitly pretending?

&gt; You don't know why they do what they do unless they say so.

Hundreds of thousands of social scientists would disagree.  That is fundamental to sociology, anthropology, and even psychology.  I don't think I overstepped my bounds at all, and I hope that was explained above.

&gt; Nobody flew a banner that said ""YEAHHH, WE'RE JUST EXACTLY LIKE THE SCOUSERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE AIMING FOR, WE DID IT AND WE'RE ALMOST AS HAPPY AS THEM NOW WOOOO"" or anything even remotely close.

It's peculiar to me, how for you everything HAS to be on the surface or it is simply unknowable.

&gt; Arriving at vastly different concepts from the same information which nobody else agrees with and that you can't actually prove..speaks for itself.

Good Luck

Kind of a condescending conclusion as well.  I really do hope you read what I wrote.  You have created a villain out of me when the crux of what I was saying is that foreign support and home/Liverpudlian support are inexorably different and always will be and that certain psychological aspects come with an attempt at appropriation.

Henderson and Can can bomb on forward from midfield and offer enough options for the player with the ball to pass on to.

&gt; Nastasic, Javi Garcia and Alvaro Negredo, would be sold if a reasonable offer comes in – as long as they complete the £30m signing of Eliaquim Mangala.

The popular method for describing new doctors seems to be old doctor math, so here we go.  (If I were 12 myself, this would be written on a chalk board BTW). 1+4+7=12. He has the prickliness of 1, but despite being roughly the same age as Hartnell when he began the role, he is much more spry, and his physicality is reminiscent of 4 in my opinion.  He also has remembered 4's tendency to shoosh people, which I find delightful. As for 7, he is Scottish and the first actor nice Sylvester McCoy to play The Doctor in the regular series who was alive when the show first aired. Also he makes the maths work. 
Most importantly however is this: he is fantastic! He has gravitas we have not seen in  NuWho and is in no way merely derivative of previous doctors. The new Doctor really is a new Doctor. Feel free to get excited.

Torres was my single favorite player before he came to Chelsea, but now I want him to leave. It's not like I hate him or anything, but he just isn't worth his massive wages. As a Chelsea fan, why would I want the team to pay lots of money to someone who won't play well?

I understand that we can't blame Torres for being on high wages. No one forced the club to pay him that much. It's also his right to stay here for two years and collect his money if he so pleases. Chelsea fans should hope he does his very best whenever he plays for us, and as long as he work hard and tries, we should support him. But don't tell me that it's good to have him on the team, and that we should love every single chelsea player ""just because.""

The fact is that Torres is costing us a shit ton of money this year. His presence affects our ability to buy another striker to improve our team. So as long as we are paying lots of money to someone who does not produce and also keeps us from signing someone who will, please don't blame us reasonable fans for wanting to see Torres leave.

(Which to me, are regular or somewhat regular starters).

I can't say that I subscribe to that notion 100% but it's interesting to think about...

**Last season** - We had six transfers in (Alberto, Aspas, Mignolet, Toure, Ilori, Sakho) plus two on loan (Cissokho, Moses). You could argue that only Mignolet and Sakho worked out. Perhaps the jury is still out on Alberto. That's a 25% so-called success rate (which jumps to 50% if Alberto and Ilori turn out to be starting XI regulars).

**This season** - So far we have Lambert, Can, Lallana, Markovic, Lovren and Origi (who goes back out on loan) + the possibility of at least one of Moreno and Manquillo + ... that Remy-esque striker, perhaps? Who knows.

But that's about 8 players coming into the squad. If *half* are a success (as measured by what I mentioned before)? I'd be *extremely happy*. Even if only 25% worked out (two players at the moment), I'd be extremely happy especially considering that we have a lot of our starting XI somewhat in place.

Origi will be loaned out but won't make an impact for a few years yet, hope he gets a chance though.  Finally, I think Lallana will be disappointing, not bad, but disappointing given his fee.  I think his signing was a mistake, although desperately hoping he proves me wrong; he is going to be the player we spend the whole year arguing over.

I think Moreno if we get him will prove a good purchase as well as Lovren.  Can has looked good in preseason and his calmness is something which I think will prove his most important attribute to the team; I see him as a sub we bring on when we need to settle the game down.  

Markovic is the wildcard for me, I think everything depends on his ability to mentally handle the pressure of expectation.  I think he'll need a year to settle in but his performance at Benfica suggests otherwise so we'll see.  Hopefully we will bring in a fourth striker, I would really like to see Lacazette as I think he could function as a rotation/cover option for Sturridge.

For starters, the [student's union](http://www.shef.ac.uk/union/awards.php) is consistently recognised as one of the best in the country. They have club nights most days, including Pop Tarts on a Saturday which was voted the best student night out in the UK.

There's lots of different pubs and clubs to cater for every taste - including the legendary [Leadmill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadmill) and [Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_(nightclub)) . There is also the Tramlines music festival, which takes over the city every year and generally has good bands.

For outdoor pursuits, parts of Sheffield actually lies with in the [Peak District](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/international/enquiry/sport/thepeakdistrict), so it's really easy to get into stuff like climbing, cycling, walking, as well as less sporty activities like photography, camping or going for a brisk walk and then stopping at a pub for a pint.

true,HealthAnxiety,null,null,"Hi there. My wife and I are an American couple who had the exact situation this time last year. We arrived on the 31st of August with a week in short term accomodation. When did you want someone to start looking? The potential problem is, we could see a flat listed online--gumtree or citylets--and if the flat was still available, they'd schedule us for a viewing. Most of them would be group viewings. Somtimes we were viewing either in a group of ten to twenty other people at the same time, or we'd line up. In either case, essentially whomever had the first chance to say they wanted it would be the person who got it. When there was a line and the first person said they'd take it, the rest of us in the queue didn't get to see it. What I mean to say is, you may be paying a person to go see things that you may not even get the chance to discuss because it'll be rented at or just after the viewing.

In the States we have rented places just after seeing pictures online. Here, as someone mentions, you have to be there in person. That was what made it so difficult for us. When we arrived last year, we had 7 days in short term accomodation. We spent about 8-10 hours every day either doing viewings--which we started showing up super, super early for--or trying to set up viewings. I kid you not, the competition to find a decent place was so intense that it became a full time job, and we didn't know if we would find a place before our short term accomodation was finished. We were then searching for more short term accomodation at the same time. It was ridiculous. 

Also something to keep in mind. We were at a disadvantage as well because there was a bit of a catch 22. The rental agencies wanted 6 months' rent in advance because we were from out of the country, and it had to be from a UK bank account. The issue with the banks was that we needed an address to get an account. We knew the Uni was going to provide a letter of introduction for my wife as a student which would allow her to get an account, but that took some time. If this is the case for you, do that as early as possible.

We ended up finding a private landlord through gumtree, and he still required 3 months' rent in advance. Be prepared. We brought over a ton of documentation showing that we could (barely) afford this, since it was so much at one time, and that may have helped. You might want to think about documentation as well. You never know. It was a tough week but we finally hd a place rented on the last day of our short term accomodation. It was so, so stressful to figure all of this out as we went along. If you have other questions, I'm more than happy to answer questions. Just thought I'd give you some insight into how our experience went at the same time last year--and that chances are if you send someone out to view, it's possible that the place could be rented immediately, or that the landlord or agency would need you in person to do anything about it.",0,1406875550,null,0,false,0,cjdrvpg,t3_2c9nk0,t1_cjdrvpg,t3_2c9nk0,null,1435011996,4,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,4

July was okay. Got old. Girlfriend got old. Made some good choices, rum was had, cigars were had.

August should be okay. Got a weekend in York, Weekend watching fireworks go BANG in the sky, a free weekend full of rum and friend-time, got a weekend at a chilli festival... that'll be a laugh.

&gt; Also, plans for the weekend? 

I really want to get spannered. But my girlfriends brothers better half is one of those arty-farty wine drinkers... I myself am taking rum. I will tell them of the delicious pint of it I am drinking and how the flavours are very aromatic and full... if they start anyway.

true,ceelo_purple,null,null,"The teaching of History (and many other subjects!) in the UK varies considerably because we allow students to specialise much younger than in the US.

An American student will study a general curriculum from K-12, whereas British compulsory schooling only lasts until age 16 and History is only a required subject until age 14. (We do start school earlier than the US, though so it's not quite as bad as it sounds!) 

Another thing (for my generation anyway) is that the teaching was modular, so we wouldn't have a class on American history where we learned it all in chronological order. Instead we would have lots of different modules throughout our school year and any of them might touch on America if it were relevant.

We also did a lot of project work, meaning that you might be doing a module on, say, Ancient History and have a choice of whether you wanted to do a personal project about the Greeks, Egyptians or Romans. Meaning that you might only do in-depth learning on one of the three.

Okay, so that's the framework for the history I studied. I started school at age 4 and the first American history I remember studying was a few years later during a module on the Age of Discovery. We looked at explorers like Cook, Columbus and Magellan and I think there might have been project work because I still have the little hand illustrated booklet I did on the voyages of Cook and I still remember some of the lyrics to the little play my friends and I did about the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, but I don't remember doing anything specific on Magellan. (I can tell you that when I was seven, they were still teaching that ""Columbus's contemporaries thought the world was flat"" bullshit.)

Two or three years later, I did a module on WWII For Kids. (Technically it was just a module on WWII, but there was a strong focus on children to make it more relatable.) We read The Machine Gunners and Goodnight Mr Tom and we had to write poems about The Blitz, Evacuees and the Home Front. We looked at the Kindertransport and the Holocaust too, although mostly in terms of the gradual restrictions on European Jewish kids than on the nitty gritty details of the death camps, because we were still pretty young. The focus was very much on how the war affected Kids Like Us and since American kids weren't particularly affected, there wasn't much of a US focus. We did talk a little about America's role in the European theatre and at one point, my grandmother came in to talk to the class about what it had been like to live through and to let all the kids in my class try on [my grandfather] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24np1r/what_is_an_interesting_fact_about_your/ch9b16i)'s old Battle of Britain flying helmet, which they went absolutely *nuts* for.

Age eleven or twelve, I had a module on Slavery, which covered the Triangle Trade, the Abolitionist Movement, the American Civil War and Emancipation. There was an emphasis on Britain's role, so we didn't learn about the textile industry in the Northern US being part of the triangle, instead there was a focus on the Lancashire cotton mills. Similarly, the primary sources we looked at for the abolitionist movement were mostly from British newspapers and politicians. We didn't cover the American Civil War in the same detail that an American student would. We never learned generals' names or specific battles and I don't think we covered the ""states rights"" argument or the other justifications that were given for the war. It was simplified down to ""At home we stopped slavery with an act of parliament, in America it was a more fundamental part of the economy, so they went to war over it internally, but they eventually did the right thing too."" (We did at least acknowledge that for a while slavery in America allowed us to have our cake and eat it too, having banned slavery in the UK, but still exploiting the economic advantages of cheap US cotton.)

We did a module on WWI somewhere around this age as well. There wasn't much of a focus on the US, beyond a consensus that your isolationist policies totally screwed us and that the death toll would have been smaller if you'd [shown up earlier] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/The_Gap_in_the_Bridge.png). (Sorry.)

We did a module on Suffrage and Civil Rights when I was twelve or thirteen. The main focus was on the UK women's suffrage movement (I was at an all-girls school at the time and suspect that my teachers were once again placing a focus on the parts they thought would hold our interest), but we also covered stuff like the Levellers and the Reform Act in the UK. Content from the States included the US women's suffrage movement, Jim Crow laws and the American civil rights movement. We also studied the ending of Apartheid in South Africa, although I suspect that was on the teacher's own initiative, since it was current affairs rather than history.

At this point I could choose which subjects I wanted to study for my GCSEs. (A previous generation would have known them as O-Levels. If you're a fan of the Harry Potter books it may be helpful to think of them as the OWLs.) Some subjects like Maths and English are compulsory at this level, but subjects like History and Geography you can choose whether to continue with. The UK doesn't have the equivalent of a high school graduation. You sit individual examinations in each subject and are given a mark for each that you show future employers. For this reason, students select the classes they're better at or which will help them to get the job or degree they want in the future. For the final two years of compulsory schooling, all your time is spent working towards these exams. I chose to ditch Geography and keep History.

So for GCSE History you had to pick a module and study it in depth. There were multiple modules you could choose from depending on which exam board you were studying with. This was usually chosen at the teacher level, so all the kids taking History GCSE at my school did the module on 20th Century History which focused on America, Western Europe, Russia, Japan and China. Over the next few years I covered America's role in WWI, the League Of Nations, the Jazz Age, Prohibition, The Dust Bowl, The Great Depression, The New Deal,  Pearl Harbour, America's role in the European and Pacific theatres of WWII, the Bomb, The UN, The Cold War and Vietnam.

I chose not to pursue History from age 16 onwards, so I don't know what American History was on the A-Level syllabus. (I had a friend who studied History at A-Level, but her focus was the Middle Ages, so it wouldn't have included you.)

So while the Revolutionary War and Westwards Expansion got mostly overlooked in my schooling, I think that overall I studied a *lot* of American History when you consider how young and remote your country is compared to, say, France. Also when you compare it to how much South American or African or even Canadian history we studied.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"Actually, we have a pretty good scouting network. Houllier's work, mostly. We have strong networks in Holland and Belgium in particular, actually. There are lots of technically sound players in both leagues who could make the transition.

As for the reason these players aren't getting the chances they might have gotten elsewhere... I covered this somewhere else. It's the same reason we have one of the best academies in Europe but don't seem to promote many players to senior level. We don't have the luxury of taking time, and bringing them through alongside top players where they can develop in a relatively safe environment. We don't have a danger room, we throw them straight into fights with sentinels. This is the real reason Lambert is bringing in experience. Not because he honestly thinks the young players he has brought in aren't good enough (with a few exceptions, like Bowery).

So yeah... I still think you're being overly harsh. Things really aren't as bad as you're making them out to be. We're still in a pretty decent position. Let's put it another way... how many young players from other teams in the bottom half of the Premier League would you take over existing options at Villa? I doubt there's many. And even if it does take them a few years to be ""good enough"" so what? Players typically hit their prime in their late 20s. That's kind of how it's *supposed* to go.

That money is more efficiently spent on things such as nuclear fusion research, which will eliminate all users needs for the current neoliberal approach employed by The Conservatives or New Labour. Neoliberlism works as an effective recovery machine, it fixes a capitalist driven money-based society.

Why do we let money drive our society? **We the people** have the right of power in democracy to have a little belief in one another, be a good citizen because if everyone is good to one another, we can all live better lives (see the United States' constitution). To me 'The Green Party of England and Wales' is the political movement  we should all support if we want to see real change. It is as simple as that.

The ultimatum facing Humanity now is one simple thing. Climate change is **real.** Whether human's have contributed significantly (or even at all) to that change remains debated, but the simple fact is it is changing. This planet is dying. Let me simply link the Fermi Paradox as to ascertain the significance of The Earth, and it's **existence**. Life as we know it is such a rare possibility, simply by the chance of uncertainty in Physics, Metaphysics..Pataphysics...we are very very lucky to be here and we need to take better care of what really matters to us. If we do not, I don't think Humanity will be here in 1000 years' time.

I hope that there are other people out there who feel (something) to what I'm saying here. All that really matter is that people ask questions. Knowledge is power.

true,Clackpot,,An Irn-Bru fist in a Black Velvet glove,"You're gonna like this.

Wine is bloody difficult to navigate; there are no hard and fast rules; wine critics are capricious and it's subjective opinion anyway; the market is saturated with mega-agribusinesses that spend as much on promotion as production; labels or prices don't mean shee-it; terroir, location, varietals, methodés, chateaux, and styles all vary widely and form no reliable guide to what's under the cork.

Consequently, the only reliable method is to ***drink ALL the wine!!*** Seriously, it's the best way, you'll thank me, your liver will thank me. Told you you'd like it!

Slightly more practically, if you want to share someone else's knowledge and recommendations, get yer arse down to Majestic, they are about as good as we've got for reasonably cheap wine with excellent choice and generally reliable quality and interest. There's a half-case minimum but they'll give you tasting notes if you want, or go at a quiet time and they'll hold your hand and guide you around. They generally have a few things to try as well.

Slightly less practically, get on a ferry and go to any large supermarket in France, and you'll have a *mahoosive* selection of viticultural riches that have been produced by enthusiasts not accountants. French supermarket wine is fucking fabulous.

Some personal musings :-

* Asda have suddenly got very aggressive about prices so there're some half-decent wines at very decent prices.
* Likewise Aldi - small selection but some of it is really rather good.
* Avoid all the capitalist lickspittle lackey running dog megalabels : Hardy's - fuck off; Jacob's Creek - go rim yerselves with a rusty corkscrew; J.P. Chenet - eat shit and die; Nottage Hill - nott a chance. You are purchasing as much promotion as wine.
* *You get what you pay for!!* Seriously. If you're paying £6 for a £12 bottle of wine that's half price, you just avoided paying £12 for a £6 bottle of wine. Whoop-fucking-ee.
* Tasting notes on the label don't mean jackshit - have you read the pretentious fucking spabble some of those twats pollute the label with?
* Try to begin to learn what you like but don't rely on it too much - grape varieties are probably the best guide but it's very vague, so for instance I am a huge fan of magnificent Chilean/Argentinian malbecs, but French malbec was famously so awful that it was fit only for blending into vins de table until they started flogging it on the coat tails of the South Americans a few years ago.
* Remember that every now and then you'll consume a bottle of something brilliant ... and it'll be the only one, when you buy another it will seem ordinary. There's no accounting for it, it just happens sometimes.
* What was good one year has no obligation to be good the next. For instance a few years ago I guzzled cases and cases of Argento malbec, it was dazzlingly good and quite cheap; nowadays it's just another label with red shit inside.
* Look for the ABV and find the level you prefer. I'm an incorrigible drunk so I like very full-bodied reds (14%-15%, oof) which might offend more delicate palates. But I make a cheerful exception for lower ABVs in lighter styles which are well-suited to hot sunny afternoons - the Italians are brilliant at this and make splendid wines for consuming at sunny pavement cafés, Sangiovese, Chianti, yadda yadda.

If you mean _""what American city is most like ***yours***""_ I would probably say downtown Boston.

Also, I get the impression it might be tied with Seattle for its citizens having the most ""European"" attitudes and lifestyles (if at all).

If you mean _""which ***British*** city is most like ours""_ I would have to say that only London might come close, but only when compared to NYC (as in being a huge metropolis with massive public transport, having a large financial district, and ridiculous housing prices).

I think everyone appreciates that there are due concerns about endangering lives even when revealing genuine security abuses that should be reason for caution in security services whistleblowing. I think Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras (et al.) have conducted themselves excellently under such pressure. Claims that they have endangered lives have been extraordinarily dubious and predicated on [equally dubious releases](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/23/uk-government-independent-military-base).

When informing the public about abuses in the public services, however, there is very little room to justify censorship on the grounds of national security. Still, however, there is so much obstructing whistleblowers from coming forward. The *Medicineballs* column of Private Eye Magazine has a long history of reporting on the mistreatment of NHS whistleblowers and is worth looking into if you're interested in more information. I think the largest obstruction for all whistleblowers though is the weakness of the public domain. It should be the realm of strength where information when brought to light causes definite action.

true,codeduck,southafrica,Saffer at large,"I think this article misses the mark.  The F-35 is not intended to be an air-superiority fighter - that role belongs to the F-22 (or the Eurofighter in the case of the UK).  The F-35 is intended to be a highly-networked, advanced strike fighter with the ability to penetrate air defence networks and attack enemy targets with stand-off weapons.  It's a sniper, not a brawler, and any F-35 pilot who gets involved in a dog-fight has failed.

The intention behind stealth aircraft is to be able to engage enemy aircraft from beyond visual range, without the risk of being engaged in return.  Whether the F-35 and F-22 will be able to do this against equivalent aircraft is up for debate, but the point is that there is nothing out there in the sky belonging to any other Airforce which is in the same class when it comes to low-observability.  That is the tactical advantage these jets bring.

You cannot view modern air combat in the same way as Korea or Vietnam.  Modern weaponry is good enough that the F-35, operating as intended with the support of F-22s and E-3 Sentries, will likely never need to enter a classic turning dog-fight.

TL;DR the F-35 is basically a faster, more maneuverable F-117A, not a stealthy F-16.

Our WWII history lessons mostly focused on The Blitz, Dunkirk, the French resistance and evacuees. Obviously American involvement was discussed with regards to D-day and the atomic bomb (taught in a fairly neutral way) but I think that was it from what I remember. I believe friends that studied WWII for GCSEs more in-depth did study more of the US involvement but for my GCSEs we studied the Industrial Revolution instead).

In no particular order, in primary school (up to 2000) I remember learning about:

- Ancient Egypt

- The Bronze age in the British Isles

- Vikings!

- Ancient Rome

- Roman Britain and their empire

- The Celts (in my case, very local history, as well as Boudica)

- Victorian Britain

- Henry VIII

- Oliver Cromwell

- History of castles

In secondary school (2000-2005) I remember learning about:

- WWI (in particular how it started and trench warfare)

- WWII (as mentioned before)

- History of the UK (how England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland became one country)

- The slave trade (US touched on here, but it was more about how Britain was involved, not what actually happened to the slaves in the Americas)

- Industrial revolution (I found in incredibly dull at the time and we spent two years on it, but it's the one topic that has really stuck with me as I can see how it changed the world so much)


Very little about the US or other colonies. Pretty sure India didn't get touched on once, which is weird as I've found learning about the East India Company totally fascinating lately.

Bookmakers do like to make money.

&gt;The odds change based on where the money is being placed, which means the only 'bias' would be towards the side where there are more people so confident of their result (for whatever reason, be it inside knowledge, personal experience or gut feeling) that they are willing to put their own money on the line for it.

An oversimplification. Bear in mind crowd psychology and cognitive biases.

&gt;In terms of a 'scientific model' for predicting the outcome of a free-will vote, it's as good as any.

Citations?

&gt;In a market with only two possible outcomes, you don't often see it get much closer to a certainty than 1/8, even taking into account that the bookmakers actual predicted probability will be longer than this.

Or the bookmakers just need to be accurate on a long-term basis, which doesn't mean that specific odds are guaranteed to be accurate.

Undertaking is dangerous, especially past a driver clearly not paying attention to the road. It also marks you out as, what is known technically in the highway code as, an 'Irredeemable arsehole"". You do not need to speed either, merely indicate and move into the right lane once there is space to safely do so. If cars behind you manage to catch up due to their speeding then they can wait patiently for you to go back into the middle lane etc.

Honking and flashing lights does you no favours, unless you are driving a BMW or Audi, in which case the correct procedure is to drive at 90-100mph at all times with your headlights on, even during the day, and to ensure you keep this speed until 3m before the bumper of the car in front. Optionally you can indicate right to allow the driver in front to know you wish to get by. BMW and Audi drivers are, interestingly, not labelled as 'Arseholes', because this would be a redundant label.

A Mercedes or VW driver may also attempt to mimic this behaviour, but always remember they merely made the incorrect decision when purchasing a car and will eventually realise their mistake and trade in for the correct variety of vehicle at a later date.

Then the weekend after i'm helping a friend move house with some ferrets. so that'll be interesting. I dont think the ferrets can carry very much though.


and then Sept/Oct some more awesome friends of mine are visiting london for various periods, so that will also be great! :D

At GCSE level it's fairly simple, and I was an exemplary student, I think I got A*'s in them all. At a-level I struggled a little, as it was much more learning based, and less intuitive. For me I'm better at subjects that involve understanding and deriving rather than learning facts. At A-level I got an A in physics, B in Maths, and C's in biology and chemistry.

At GCSE I found chemistry quite interesting, but I became disillusioned at A-level. 

At uni I went on to study physics as I didn't want to limit my options, but again found this much more challenging than A-level (though it was interesting), it was also heavily maths based. I switched degrees and did computer science, something I initially wrote off as being too easy. 

Ultimately I'd say you need to study things which interest you, otherwise you will struggle to do well in them. I always had an interest in computers and programming, but being indecisive I didn't want to limit my choices at the time.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Another slight, central midfield creative midfield player with good technique. Like *another* Tom Carroll, just a bit younger. Just with that little extra Portugese flair as he's born in Lisbon IIRC. 

Seems to be have been around the Youth setup forever, since 2011. Actually scored 2 awesome goals against Reading U21's at the back end of last season - [interview here](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs-tv/interviews/lameiras-happy-with-his-two-strikes/)

He's at that stage where it's make or break I think. He's 19, so has age on his side compared to say Cebellos, Carroll, Mason &amp; Pritchard -  15 apps for the U21 league last year with a handful of goals &amp; assists. Whenever I read match reports on our u21's or highlights it's always ''the *impressive* Lamerias beats 2 Arsenal players..'' or ''Lamerias with another good shift'' and such. Played well in the Next Gen tournament a couple years ago too. So all things considered - I think he needs a good loan now to show what he can really do - Championship would be perfect imo. Unless Poch sees something in him and it'll be a Bentaleb rise into the First Team but I doubt it. It's funny mentioning Nabil - there's an article that mentions at one stage Bentaleb looked a better prospect in a more advanced position, compared to the MC/DM role we play him in, when we lost 5-3 to Sporting youth. 

* Pushed forward after Lameiras was substituted, Bentaleb unfortunately only had five minutes to impress in the number 10 position before being replaced himself, although in that time alone he began two promising attacks.

* Overall, Bentaleb’s performance suggested that he is not cut out for the rough and tumble of the holding midfielder position, but has more than enough skill and ability to develop into an excellent playmaker.

Kinda ironic right, especially considering the ''What is Bentaleb'' thread we had on here recently.

So yeah, echo'ing what I said before he needs First Team football now with adults. A good loan to a good footballing side. Derby with Carroll perhaps. Maybe even a good footballing side abroad as he's spent 3+ years with us in England. Then after that if he impresses enough - try ease him into the first team (Cup games, Europa early stages) but if not - try get a decent profit for him like a couple million. Depends what Poch sees in him. He might have a Bentaleb rise, but that's doubtful.

Also to add that Onomah seems to have better potential and is [catching up to him fast,](http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/spurs-delighted-josh-onomah-progress-4022897#.U9tyifldXi8) despite being 2 (iirc) years younger.

Plenty. Forecasting is a large area of research.

[This](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1503350) goes one further and concludes that betting exchanges (like those on Betfair) are more accurate than bookmakers themselves, and I'd be inclined to agree with them, even though the system is more or less exactly the same. Incidentally, Betfair's exchange is offering [roughly the same odds](http://www.betfair.com/exchange/politics/market?id=1.110033387).

I also feel (and he's said himself) his injury still mentally plagues him in 50/50s and despite saying he feels strong, as a combative DM I'm sure it bothers him. Problem is, will anyone pay 20m? Napoli didn't even wanna pay 12. And I don't want to see Capoue leave (I think he'll prove his worth as one of the better DM's in the EPL/Europe) and I posted tons of stats up on why I think that (if you wanna see, let me know, you might have already), mainly from his last full fit season. He didn't even play in what, a dozen games? 8 starts or something? A full season and you'll see the real Capoue which I still think can improve a little.

One interesting stat - in one 33 minute cameo v Palace he made more interceptions than West Ham, West Brom and Sunderland (IIRC) combined over 90 minutes. And his form for Tolouse was one of the best in Europe ''stats'' wise, and he was the best and most intimidating DM's in France. He's built like a brick shithouse who can maintain 87-90% pass completion rates. So if it's a choice of those 3, for me it's Capoue/Scheniderlin despite my absolute LOVE for Sandro.

I can't speak to Sinclair's workrate because I mostly watch the 10-20 minute highlights on lfc.tv, and you won't see a ton of what he does off the ball in those videos. He looks like a poacher, though. His pace would probably compare favorably with premier league strikers, but he's still not built like a man. Like you'll look at him and he'll look like the 17/18 year old that he is. Definitely not physically developed like Ibe or anything, and nowhere near as skillful as Raheem. 

He's comfortable on the ball though, and like I said, he has that nose for goal that can't be taught. You have to remember that academy players very, very rarely make it through to the first team. Just have to temper expectations a bit. 

He definitely isn't ready to contribute  to the first team yet. I think best case scenario we see him play another year in the reserves/academy, then go on loan next season. I think he has a premier league future, but I don't know if he'll be good enough for our first team. That's something we'll have to wait and see with as he develops.

* found Marcus Edwards in the middle. He beat three defenders before finding Dhanda – who cut in and curled a beauty into the top corner from the edge of the area.

* Four minutes later they had a third courtesy of Tottenham Hotspur forward Marcus Edwards, who met a long ball and controlled perfectly before finishing right-footed.

* but a fourth duly arrived courtesy of Edwards who sealed his brace in emphatic style.

* With 49 minutes on the clock, Dhanda cut down the left and played it to the feet of Edwards, and he produced a fantastic strike from just inside the area to grab his second from 14 yards.


Heres a writeup done on him (posted before). Another real talent we have.

*Marcus Edwards, of Tottenham Hotspur, in the Under-16s, who lights up in the role in the hole, the systems and the technical approach now apparent in the national teams are the same. England is bedding in a new DNA right down through the age groups – hopefully for ages to come.*

Another writeup from ''Next England Youth Breakout Star''

*A standout at U16 level for both Spurs and his country, Edwards is a lively and flexible midfielder whom the club – who have been developing a strong batch of youngsters with the help of concepts such as NextGen Series – have high hopes for. Though he hasn’t been moved up this time around for the U17 squad (team-mate Joshua Onomah is in, however), some feel Edwards has what it takes to begin skipping stages much like United’s Wilson.* 

Pretty sure scoring 2 and assisting 1 for the U17's means he's moved up? They think he'll skip age groups he's that good though.

- Dejan Lovren, £20m
- Divock Origi, £10m

- Total: £89m

We apparently had a budget of £60m; add that to the £70m-ish we got for Suarez and we have a total budget of £130m. (£130m - £89m) + £26m (Borini + Agger) = £67m. (I think. :P)

From that total left over, I **do** think we'll need another striker as Sturridge and Lambert alone aren't enough. We are now also getting closer to Moreno and Manquillo. 

I imagine Moreno will cost us £20m, and Manquillo is a loan who  I believe will cost us £6m to buy after 2 years. That still leaves a truckload of money left to spend if we need to, either on a decent striker or a marquee signing.

I could get a cheapo for $30 and a goid one for $100 - $200. It also seems that the violent crimes are more violent and happen when it's not necessary. A lot of times there isn't another crime they are trying to commit, three or four guys were bored so they decide to jump an elderly lady and take screw drivers to her, or whatever. These things seem to be happening more during the day, with people all around and no one stops to help anymore. Everyone pulls out the cellphone to record it and put it on youtube later. It's disgusting. 

Then there are the police. Now, while there are a lot of good people in uniform you also have cops killing civilians in the same manner. Right in front of onlookers. You are more likely to get killed by a police officer then from a criminal. Some cops treat everyone like they are criminals.

true,[deleted],null,null,"State owned industries can be successful, as certain examples the author pulls out clearly show- but they only work when the state itself is well managed, highly efficient, and so on.

Take Singapore, for example, (which by the way has a super-efficent privatised universal healthcare system that supports the poor whilst spending less than 3% of GDP), the state in Singapore is extraordinarily efficient.  It's leaders are the highest paid in the world (I believe the PM earns several million dollars), its government works well (though is more than a little authoritarian), and the country as a whole functions excellently.  

But let's face it, some countries do state-run enterprise better than others.   In nations where publicly owned corporations are run by skilled businesspeople, pay salaries similar to the private sector, and cant be shut down or rebuilt every 5 years when a new government comes into power, they can be highly successful.  

But this is the UK.  Home of endless bureaucracy to the point of ridicule.  Capital of government waste.   The place where the first thing Party B does upon coming to power is reverse anything that Party A did, just because they can.  The place where state-owned industry has, for so long, been proven to be terribly inefficient, so many times.  

I don't mind trying again for some things, but we're not Singapore.  And, for that matter, the US military situation is not exactly state-controlled.  Massive private companies like Lockheed as well as thousands of smaller contractors supply a large chunk of the US's needs.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"In fairness, the F15 that came into service in the mid 1970s is hardly the plane that flies now. They went through an extensive improvement program between 1983 and 1985. Around the same time McDonnell Douglas built a spin-off all weathered version called the F15E Strike Eagle. Despite the similarity in name and appearance it is largely a separate aircraft. Then in 1997 the aircraft engines were upgraded, and in 2007 their radar was replaced. There's now an ongoing program to update the avionics and interface. The same can be said for the F16.

They also don't use **our** harrier, and never did. They built their own licensed version (which is extensively different) called the McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier **II**. We made a spin off of their spin off (confused yet?) called the BAE Harrier II (also known as the GR5, 7 and 9). Both are them are derrived from the earlier Hawker Siddley Harrier which was an entirely different aircraft - the GR1 and 3 variants are the 1960s versions made famous during the Falklands war, and they were fully retired during the 1980s.

I disagree with your point that the F35B is an expensive mistake, and I'm going to try and convince you because I think your view is born out of genuine misunderstanding. Most defense sources both in the UK and elsewhere now agree that the direction air forces are going in is rapidly towards unmanned aircraft. In the past this has meant fairly crude aircraft like the [MQ-1 Predator Drones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_drone). They are basically cheap airframes with moderate endurance that can launch a limited number of weapons on ground targets or undertake surveillance, nothing more. However, newer models under development like the [BAE Taranis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bae_taranis) are more like multirole jet fighters that can take on a range of tasks - even dogfighting with a manned jet fighter. 

The real question in the defence aviation industry now is *""What should the balance of manned:unmanned aircraft be?""*, and the truth is nobody has an answer because no modern airforce has really had to put it to the test. There is actually a very strong argument going on in UK defense that is pushing for a roughly 3:1 ratio of combat aircraft - and in that context it makes excellent sense to have an extremely modern, versatile, manned 5th generation fighter like the F35B, to back up a larger force of impressive but less capable unmanned combat air vehicles, and the ""all purpose"" manned Eurofighter Typhoon can continue to fill in the gaps.",0,1406896437,null,0,false,0,cjdweij,t3_2cbik6,t1_cjdweij,t1_cjdu79v,null,1435014226,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

If there are any additional furnishings that you don't want (for fear of damage - e.g. pictures, rugs) then ask for them to be removed and stricken from the inventory. We made a mistake once of ignoring a broken childs toy bike from the previous tenant - it was included in the inventory so we ended up keeping this thing around right up to the end and put it back when we left!

You can get an agreement they'll fix it after you move in but my experience (renting several properties) is that landlords tend to become a little lazy once they've got their monthly paycheck and I've had them ignore things they promised to fix for years.

Damp and condensation are the responsibility of your landlord, not you! The agency may try to get you to sign some kind of additional bit of paper about condensation (because it's a big problem in the UK). Resist signing it as much as possible. If you do happen to sign it, don't worry too much - I don't think it's been tested in court yet - just make sure you report all instances condensation damage to the landlord as soon as you see it. They may ask you to open the windows etc... but I find this highly unreasonable especially during winter - the onus is on them really to have work done to ensure proper ventilation in their property. Just stick to your guns on this one and fight any claim that it's your responsibility.

The most important advice I think comes towards the end of your contract.... don't bring these up with the agent, they are employed by the landlord, act in the landlords interests and will certainly deny knowledge of your rights. Off the top of my head:

* There is no legal requirement for you to re-sign (therefore paying a renewal fee of any kind) after the initial contract ends... you can stay and roll onto a statutory rolling tenancy with all the same terms.
* Landlords must provide an itemised list of damages and estimates within 10 days of the end of your tenancy which you can come to agreement on. The deposit is YOUR deposit and YOUR money, therefore they must agree with you on how much is needed to cover the cost of repair....
* They must return the deposit to you, with agreement of deductions, within those 10 days! If they don't supply the itemised list or don't supply your deposit within that timeframe, then you are entitled to demand the whole lot back without any deductions (do not rely on the TDS resolution option - go straight for the Courts).
* Repair means bringing something back to it's original state when took on the property... not NEW furnishings. E.g. they can repair the curtains or replace them, they can't charge you for a new set of curtains.
* Damage != wear and tear. E.g. if the carpets become worn through normal use then that is not something you are liable for and cannot be deducted from your deposit. Of course, if the carpet is damaged through spills or burns - then you are liable - but similar to the above, the landlord can't charge you for new carpets - only repair (a spillage might require only cleaning). Furthermore, all furnishings have a life expectancy, if you rent a place with old and worn furnishings then the value of them may be little to nothing. If something does become damaged, you are only responsible for the damage up to the CURRENT VALUE of the item, NOT for a NEW replacement.",0,1406896841,null,0,false,0,cjdwiz8,t3_2cbsuo,t1_cjdwiz8,t3_2cbsuo,null,1435014276,16,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,16

Infact, the only failure I can think of with the Typhoon was in the export market, where it was undercut in cost by several similar jets, though none with the performance and flexibility of the Typhoon. Unfortunately though, at a time of international defense austerity it meant that nations were unwilling to ""buy into"" the quality of the Typhoon, opting instead for cheaper alternatives.

If recall correctly, the sports touring tyre they were offering me was gonna be £160 ish fitted for a pair, 160 rear 120 front. 

I would not ever skimp on tyres though. I seem to remember fifth gear did a test on car tyres, and whatever the outcome was, I definitely remember the name brands (Michelin, Dunlop, etc) stopped a noticeable amount quicker than the no name brands. Whilst that test was done in cars, I'm sure the same applies to bikes, and with the sort of drivers that are out there, I want the most grip possible for emergency braking and cornering. 

Remember that on a bike the contact patch of the tyres is way smaller than a car, and unlike a car, when that contact patch fails you will fall off and probably be injured in the process.

true,Unlinkedhorizonzero,,Belfast,"Since A lot of you don't know what its about I'm going to explain a little about it. It isn't commemorating the IRA or paramilitary outfits nor is it glorifying terrorism in anyway - It is a commemoration and remembrance of the thousands of innocent men and teenagers taken out from their homes in the middle of the night, tortured and humiliated all due to the belief that they were paramilitary/IRA by the RUC. 

The RUC had false information on people and even tried to intern some that were already dead (example of how wrong their information was) - This lead to mass amounts of fathers, sons and brothers taken from their homes in front of their families and soccumed to a list of torture treatments against their will. 

In depth interrogation with the use of hooding, white noise, sleep deprivation, prolonged enforced physical exercise together with a diet of bread and water.
Deceiving detainees into believing that they were to be thrown from high flying helicopters. In reality the blindfolded detainees were thrown from a helicopter that hovered approximately 4 feet above the ground.
Forcing detainees to run an obstacle course over broken glass and rough ground whilst being beaten.  This was just a few examples.


I don't personally approve of the parade marching through Belfast but the ""PUL"" (sorry for generalising) community only see it as a glorification to terrorism and the IRA and see fit to attack and riot in an attempt to stop it. They can't grasp the concept that no-one from the protestant aspect of Belfast had to endure these tortures simply because of where they lived and what religion they were.

Yes, stabbings are more common, but they are also much less likely to lead to anyone getting killed. Personally I think a big factor in the lower rate of murders is the fact that people don't feel the need to go Rambo and escalate a dangerous situation by pulling out their own weapon and giving the criminal no choice but to use theirs. If you get mugged, you give up your possessions, let the police pursue the matter and carry on with your life intact. It's not good but it's far better than trying to defend yourself and getting shot.

I guess the big difference is that we don't see life as a competitive, survival of the fittest thing. Somehow we have so far avoided all being killed by the criminals. I think being constantly on-edge about the possibility that any person you meet might want to kill you and your family for no reason must be pretty exhausting.

You don't mention if you are a homeowner yourself. If not, this may restrict the BTL market further as most lenders require you to own your own home.

That said, if you are not a homeowner then you may be able to buy your parents' property on a residential mortgage and deal with costs/apportionments via a deed of trust or the like - again, you'll need a good mortgage broker and solicitor.

The $1 Trillion figure quoted isn't the buying price, it's one of the estimates for purchasing, flying and maintaining a fleet of well over 1000 aircraft for over 30 years - but the sensationalist figure is never explained properly in the press.

Yes the F-35 is draggy, and guess what, so were other highly successful designs like the Phantom. Also the author gets several points of fact wrong - the F-35 was never intended for VTOL operations and was not designed for this, and yet this is asserted as being the case. If the author doesn't know the difference between VTOL and STOVL then I have little confidence in his other capabilities.

Lastly, this simulation is about an aircraft with it's capabilities not fully up to spec yet (still in testing), the full scope of which are certainly not in the public domain. It's also assuming that the aircraft are 'the survivors of a cruise missile strike on their bases' - so basically with a massive handicap in terms of numbers. How can the model accurately predict the radar signature of the F-35 (which is classified), the capability of the Chinese radars (also classified), and 1000 other details all of which are top secret, or simply unknowable?

Olof was the person that trigged and challenged me. This drove me to want to do more on the pitch.

Olof had a winner mentality like no other. He simply refused to lose, not only in football but in practically everything. And when he did lose, which rarely happened, he refused to admit it. I think this mentality was what took him a long way in his carreer.

I’ve been doubly lucky when it comes to Olof. Firstly because I got to play with him, and secondly because I got know the person Olof Mellberg, not only the player.

If Olof in my opinion is the best Swedish defender of all times, I think the person Olof is even better.

It is sad that Olof now chooses to end his career because I’m sure he has much more to give.

I wish Olof Mellberg and his family all happiness and love in the future.

true,dave8001,null,null,"The 7th Doctor was met with a number of problems.  Including the fact that the controller of the BBC at the time did not like Doctor Who; and made it his mission to get the show cancelled.  

Sylvester McCoy is a good actor, and played the role of The Doctor well.  His final performance (during the movie) was just brilliant.  However; due to budgetary constraints the series vision was reduced.  

I remember one scene annoying me because they used Cathy's Café in Eastenders for a scene in Remembrance of The Daleks; and I know...its the BBC, so it is likely that they will use and re-use a lot of sets to ensure the best use of their budget; but it would be like them using the console room for the TARDIS as a Doctor's waiting room in Eastenders - just a bit ludicrous.  

As well as that; I was not a fan of Ace.  I found her quite annoying, so there were a number of factors that made the 7th Doctor's run unfortunately not as good by comparison to others.  

Given that Sci-Fi was pretty in at the time of the return of Doctor Who in the UK; and the budgets had changed...I was pretty sure that they would be able to do a much more rounded job than had happened with the final run of Doctor Who in the '80's.  

Unfortunately, when the show returned I felt underwhelmed by it.  I thought that they tried to make The Doctor fit the prescribed definitions of what society deem as ""cool""; and it was my opinion that this was never him. Furthermore, with the use of Billie Piper as the assistant it kind of didn't sit well with me.  So when it returned initially I didn't actually watch the show.  

I was also quite a big fan of David Tennant; and when I heard that he had went for the role, but was turned down for Christopher Eccleston; my thoughts were ""why?  he'd be brilliant for the role?""  

I must say (all apart from my opinion of David Tennant) I was completely wrong.  

I started watching when David Tennant eventually did get the role; at the Christmas Special.  For the first couple of years I avoided watching Series 1; and only went back to it when I had been off sick from work for a few days in 2008; and it was the week between ""The Stolen Earth"" and ""Journey's End""; and because I was on edge due to the cliff hanger between the two; I needed to see new Doctor Who...then remembered that I had never actually watched any of Series 1.

I then sat there and watched the whole lot in about 2 days, and (apart from the pilot, which I'm still not too fussed over) I couldn't believe that I had never watched it.  How ridiculous it was that I had allowed hang ups hold me back with the show for almost 4 years.  

So in short...I wasn't too enamoured by the prospect of the return; but wish I had gotten over myself and actually taken the time with the show; because I could have been part of the family a whole year earlier.

It's my parents at fault, but when NR more than double the repayments for the mortgage when interest only payment period ended, at a time of recession, when my parents are on reduced hours and have had to eat into savings, it's not going to end well is it? 

The quotes we have for this property are much more reasonable, and we aren't going to go interest-only payments at all, so we shouldn't have the sudden jump in payments they had. Besides, like I said, the house can be covered by myself and my brother (tbh, probably myself on my own if needed) if they end up not being able to pay.

I guess the march will show us, one way or the other. Any references to the IRA, Bobby Sands or any of the rest of them are, in the eyes of anyone watching, going to nullify any of the points you've made.

I think the starting lineup for Burnley might go something like this:

     Azpilicueta - Terry - Cahill - Luis 
                Matic - Mikel

Similarly there is no unique message or truth in his work. He unlocks few hidden truths, lifting the blinkers from no one. Relying on crude juxtaposition or unconvincing metaphors he is no smarter than a rat he once used to stencil.

His political stunts in Gaza were easily criticised and his muddled anticapitalist stance while being sponsored by Nike (complete with baffling anti corporate bumf in the notes) was stupid. Not as stupid as the commercialised copies that have been made in his absence though. Cheep and tirelessly tacky
 These are as much his art as the actual stencils on a wall. Mass produced in an age of reproduction, surveillance and comodification, a shame none of this 'artistic' merit can be attributed to him. More the stall holders and cheep printers knocking him off.

The enigmatic invisibility is perhaps his only strength insulating the man from criticism as he is not there. He is an artistic fart, invisible and a little too close to shit.

true,jimheenan,null,null,"Oddly, at least for me I probably learnt a lot more about US history from classes that weren't actually history classes, we covered the klu klux klan, and slavery in Religous &amp; Moral Education (RME) and hence a bit about the US civil war as its precursor, and I'm fairly sure we also briefly covered African Slavery in English of all classes. We also bizarrely covered the American Dream in modern studies (aka politics)) which looking back on it always reminds me of an Al Murray joke in that we don't have a British dream because we're awake.

In history (though it could have been RME) I think we learnt about Native Americans. The only other thing I can recall relating to US history, specifically from History classes was the mentioning of the US involvement in WW1 and WW2, though in each of these the focus was not on the US but mostly on trench warfare for WW1 and the holocaust, western front, atomic bombings and the blitz/Battle of Britain for WW2, we might have covered El Alamein and Stalingrad but then I'm quite interested in WW2 history so I may have learnt this out of school. We might have also covered the Cold War too with the main bits being the Cuban Missile Crisis and the moon landings.

We mostly learn about UK specific stuff, roman occupation, victorian era, industrial revolution (and don't quote me on this but in England I believe the Norman Conquest, English Civil Wars &amp; War of the Roses are covered, here in Scotland they aren't or at least weren't covered for me to my knowledge), the gunpowder plot, the formation of the UK (aka the acts of union and union of crowns) and possibly (I don't know if I learnt about these in school or just from news/other people) The Troubles and the Falklands War. Being in Scotland we also covered Scottish specific stuff such as the Wars of independence and the Jacobite Uprising. 

The wars we cover generally directly involve the British Isles. Although when we cover wars we usually focus on the bad shit and how it affects people or how it affected the region it was fought rather than focusing on battles or who won and who lost which I think is a much healthier way of doing it. We don't focus too much on our wars during the empire colonialism days since we'd still be covering them (although I do wish they covered the [Anglo-Zanzibar war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zanzibar_War) since you would be able to cover it all in one lesson :D). It's easier for teachers to say, we did some good stuff but we were also cunts in doing it, and focus on the effects the empire had on the UK, the world and the more massive wars (napoleonic, WW1 and WW2), instead of the nitty gritty.

I've probably missed a lot of what was covered but then we did have a shit ton of history to learn about. (Note in high school I did the compulsory 2 years of history but didnt continue it on for my standard grades/highers, - I chose geography, so I probably didn't cover anywhere near everything the class taught, we also covered historical stuff in other classes too like RME and personal &amp; social education (SE)).

There is a fair amount of US stuff we don't cover, I don't think we cover the war of 1812 at all as it was in comparison a small war sandwiched in the much bigger napoleonic wars, which I think we did cover or at least mentioned. I don't think the American revolution is covered in detail or even at all either but I had knowledge of it before leaving school. 

Sorry for the wall!

tl;dr we cover some US stuff, but probably not the stuff you think we cover.

I don't see how the blog post you linked to refutes this; it's talking about betting exchanges as a means for gathering intelligence, and at worst, says it isn't as reliable as whatever means GCHQ use, which I don't think anyone is disputing. The article even links to a book which supports my point.

It doesn't matter whether the market is a football game, a referendum, or Who Shot Phil - the format is the same. Bookmakers wouldn't have entire arms of their business for specials (non-sport) markets if they weren't making them money (read: making accurate predictions. If they predict odds that are too long for a particular result, they will pay out more than they take in, thus losing money, just so we can stop the back and forth on your first point). 

&gt;Citations?

Why/how do I need to provide a citation for my own opinion? It's incredibly unlikely that a bookmaker would massage the odds for one side in this market, as both Brits and Scots use it, which exposes them to unneeded risk. It's also impossible for a betting exchange to come up with shaded odds, as the odds are not set by the bookmaker, but the bettors themselves.

Using a bookmaker's odds to conclude that the referendum will more than likely end up in a 'no' outcome is a perfectly legitimate method, and one which has been used for decades.

2. make sure you know where the money for every person's costs (mortgage interest / maintenance / rent) is going to come from.  it will get very complicated if the house needs a new boiler and your bro can't afford to pay for half. likewise, you need to be confident about the rent you will receive from your parents.  i assume they are close to retiring (if they haven't already) and you need to know what rent they can afford and hence what you will receive long-term.  this will mean them being very open about their financial situation with you, which might be awkward now but important in the long run.

true,inawordno,eng-westmidlands,Brummie,"Well I don't know about blasphemous but as far as contemporary music goes The Beatles had the most impact and it's definitely not unreasonable to consider them theist important and innovative band of all time. They changed so many facets of pop music which we now take for granted. 

My only criticism comes in hailing them as the first band to do X when another band had previously done X but just weren't as popular. I don't think it takes anything away from them though. They grew as a band and evolved along with the music scene whilst trailing new paths. 

I love the clash by the way. 

&gt;I'm not saying they're *bad* lyrics, just that you can't honestly suggest that nobody in the last decade could come up with lyrics of such utter genius as ""all you need is love, love is all you need""

You sound sarcastic so I assume you think they're bad lyrics. It was written by someone who wrote some really poetic stuff, so we know he is capable of it . The idea was to send a sort of simple message because they believed it was just that. 

&gt;I think the Beatles are overrated, but it would be ridiculous of me to pretend they were poor lyricists, or songwriters.  

I think overrated isn't a bad shout. I still would class them as the best pop artists to have ever lived. 

&gt;I personally think The Clash are the best band of all time, they're at least in with a shout. But some people (including people born decades after they broke up) seem to think that its not allowed, blasphemous, or somehow *wrong* to have the opinion its anyone other than the Beatles. 

You can take loads of Clash lyrics out of the song and they sound ridiculous. I still love their lyrics and think they do what they wanted brilliantly. ""Everybody says what's he like, and everybody says is he alright"" - is terrible on its own. But I think they're brilliant lyrics. 

I'm not really arguing against you I hope. My point is that it's unfair to take these things out of context; historical or otherwise.

It's not unreasonable no. They've almost certainly got the strongest case. But I don't understand why its so cut and dried to some people.   
Plus, the same people who argue the Beatles more or less invented modern music say in the same breath that modern music is rubbish, implying they've not done a very job. 

&gt; You sound sarcastic so I assume you think they're bad lyrics.

I genuinely don't, I just don't think (those particular) lyrics are especially great either. They've got some great ones, but those particular songs aren't anything special imo.  
But no, they're by the Beatles, ergo, they're classics that any other band in history would sell a kidney to have written. 
I think ""Baby I Love You"" by the Ramones is a great, simple track, if it was by the Beatles, you might well be saying ""oh its simple on purpose, fantastic lyrics"" etc etc.

Courtois has just barely started training while Cech has multiple preseason games under his belt.  I see no reason why we wouldn't start Cech in the first game.

As much as I love Ivanovich, I see Azpi taking the right back spot most games, unless Brani is in superb form.

I like Fabregas playing further forward than CDM, but that could work too.  MVG and Matic are like a smaller wall in front of our back 4.

Once he's match fit, Oscar will likely start in the right mid spot rather than Salah, but this is day 1.  I see Cesc moving back and forth in mid a lot, he'll drop back to almost CDM, feeding balls over the top to Costa(and the other AMs), and he'll make runs himself when Costa is out wide.

If Johnson goes I imagine Flanagan will get the nod to start at right back if we don't sign anyone else.

I'm in two minds about Johnson, on the one hand I think we should keep him and allow his contract to run up, we'll need him with the increase in games, Brendan might sort him out and he could surprise us.

On the other, we could sell him and with the money, get a solid senior right back.

There's something worrying me about having just Flanagan, Kelly and Manquillo, who I don't think many of us know much about, as our only right backs, there's not a whole lot of experience there. Flanagan's put in a good season, still relatively short on experience but he worries me the least, Kelly's injury prone, hasn't really played much in the last season or two, Manquillo is an unknown quantity at this stage, could turn out to be great, but could easily flop.

1). The only thing he really did wrong was not getting close enough. He had his body in the way to show him wide, and was jockeying decently. Its at a distance that 9/10 times we'd be fine with letting them have a go from there. I don't want Johnson to run out and overly commit because then the attacker can skip around him, and have an even better chance.

2) I agree that he should foul him there, take the yellow, and run it off. He does *alright* defensively at the half way line. His body positioning is to stop the attacker from cutting in and exploiting the massive gap between Johnson and Skrtel. He makes the attacker take a heavy touch to push it wide which is fine, and allows the midfielders to get back into the box in time. He also catches up to the attacker. I think he could've done more to stop the pass, but its hardly poor defending. The fault for that goal lies more on the defender (Flanno? I can't tell due to the shit video quality) who was picking up the goalscorer. Flanno lets the striker drift way too far away from him, and should be tighter that the striker doesn't have time to let the ball run across him and shoot. 

3) Skrtel is doubled up on, and for some reason decides to be aggressive and rush out and challenge the header, which I wouldn't want him to do there. While Johnson could've done more, that could've been said for the entire back 4 who could've shifted across to help, and Lucas/Allen/Gerrard who should've picked up the initial man. While Johnson didn't help, the entire sequence is shambolic defending and its unfair to focus that solely on Glen.",0,1406907305,null,0,false,0,cje122j,t3_2cbxps,t1_cje122j,t1_cjdzbut,null,1435016601,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

I read your blog post in full. It offers some sceptical opinions on whether it is more useful than other intelligence gathering methods, which is fine. As much as I do not wish to use your own methods of arguing, this is a single blog post. It doesn't even say that prediction markets don't work. I gave you examples showing that they do. I don't know what more you want.

If you want the idea applied to politics rather than sports, how about [this paper](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/0895330041371277)? It shows political betting is very much a thing, and has been used hundreds of times to predict the outcome of elections.

&gt;But those arms exist to make money, not necessarily be accurate. 

Can you please explain how bookmakers make money by getting the results of their markets wrong? 

As for your need for 'citations' for why shading would not be used in this market (something that would be obvious if you knew anything about betting exchanges, and something I already explained in the second half of my previous post), look at page 4 in [the second paper I linked you to](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1503350), which will explain to you what shading is.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"It depends on a few things, I think we can all agree that Chelsea and City are way ahead, and will need a miracle to catch up, which puts two places up for grabs between a lot of teams.

Liverpool, Arsenal, Man Utd, Spurs and Us are all in the mix, and there may well be a surprise in there somewhere (if, say, Newcastle's purchases explode).

I think Arsenal have to be favourites for third place, they have improved upon their team last year, and will have Theo back soon, who is utterly vital to them. If, and it is a big if, Arsenal stay fit, they will be right up there... If they have another injury mess, then who knows.

Then I think second favourite have to be Man Utd- they are spending heavily, and smartly, and have a good manager in. They could take some time to adapt, but I honestly expect them to be right on our heels all the way through the season. A bad start however could derail them for some time, as confidence is low there. 

Then Liverpool, who, like Man Utd are hard to predict. They could realistically get anywhere between top 3 and mid table depending on how their new transfers gel, and how Brenda changes the system. They have lost their talisman, and wasted a lot of money.. But Brenda is a very good tactician, so he will make the most out of what they have.

Spurs are more of a wildcard, but Poch went into So'ton and was able to force him game on the team very quickly, so they are worth mentioning. I don't think anyone really expects a top 4 challenge from them, but they have a lot  of quality.

Then there is us. We are probably the easiest team to predict- because we have not made many changes to the team. We still need a winger and a backup for Barkers, and we will be stronger than next year (with more depth, and our kids with more experience), but if we are to challenge then we need to get off to a flying start. 

If we can secure 7 points from our first 3 games, then I can see us challenging for the top 4... but if we fall short of that, then I think other teams will make good on a head start (akin to last season), and will be tough to catch. 

In terms of league finishes.. I say we get top 4 around 15-20% of the time this season- but as I said throughout last year, as long as we are growing and improving every year, the final table standing is not the be all and end all long term.

* There was no herbal tea.

She blamed us for not making the diagnosis when there was nothing to find.

Of course, there are some more serious problems thrown up. Misdiagnosis is common because of the nature of the work, communication is and always will be an issue and doctors and nurses will and do make mistakes.

I'm very worried about this system, I don't think it plays to our strengths, and it has a dodgy track record in the Prem, with the exception of Hull last year. But we are not Hull, we are not a disciplined bunch of team-focused, tactically-minded players, and we will get pulled apart by teams with high technical ability. We lack goal-scoring midfielders, wing-backs who can cross from deep, and CMs who can exploit space in the middle of the pitch - all of which are essential for a 3-5-2. What's more I think we'll be defensively vulnerable as our current crop of midfielders are positionally hopeless (exhibit A, Joey). 3 at the back demands a lot of the positional sense of its midfielders, as they effectively have to zonally cover the entire middle third of the pitch when not in possession.

Firstly, the SNP do not vote on English matters which do not affect Scotland out of ethical reasons. This is different for labour and the lib dems that force their scots MPs using the whip to vote. 

The reason it's a slight grey area is that even though a bill or vote might not directly affect Scotland, a vote passed or failing to pass ends up affected scotland indirectly due to the Barnett formula. So voting for or against a bill which at a glance doesn't look like it will affect scotland, does 

An example of this is NHS privatisation. While health care is devolved, if England votes for increasing privatisation the funding decreases and as does Scotland's due to the parity of Barnett.

GCSE to A-Level is the biggest jump in terms of difficulty. You need to pick subjects that you are good at, but more importantly, that you'll enjoy. At your age I picked maths because I was good at it. I hated it and subsequently did quite badly. Try to get a good spread of subjects, look at what they require in the course. So for example, try to pick one essay heavy subject, one coursework heavy one and one that relies more on exams. That way you don't be snowed under doing the same thing at the same time for several subjects. 

As a tangent, university isn't all its cracked up to be. There was a time when it was a necessary path in life but I personally think that time is over. With increasing fees it seems crazy to say that one path fits all. In reality, I have plenty of friends who didn't go to university and now enjoy successful careers in the areas they love. If you want to be a lawyer, teacher or scientist, sure go to university, but if you're not certain then an apprenticeship is much more rewarding nowadays.

England alone is a nation of over 50 million people, having it governed by an English parliament consisting of hundreds of MPs would offer very little improvement in efficiency and accountability over a British parliament serving 60 million people.

I think this is the main problem with the idea of devolution in England. For Scotland and Wales, devolution satisfies both those who simply want their nation to be a more 'proper' nation by having its own government and those who want greater control over affairs more pertinent to them. An English parliament will not bring any of the practical benefits of devolution, all it will do is eliminate the west lothian question which isn't particularly troublesome in practice any way. Therefore it will be difficult convincing some people it will be worth having. Conversely, regional assemblies, as you noted, wouldn't be based on any sort of cohesive regions within England that have historical basis. Places like Yorkshire and Cornwall would be obvious candidates for having their own assemblies, as would a number of big cities (London already has its own assembly and this could probably be repeated in places like Birmingham and Manchester), but in other parts this would be more difficult, especially where there are neighbouring counties that have historic rivalries.",0,1406912978,null,0,false,0,cje49ro,t3_2cbx15,t1_cje49ro,t1_cje2d28,null,1435018029,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Snackasaurus,England,"London ","Motorbikes are sadly extremely easy to steal. You can have all the security you like, but there will always be a tool to cut through it. I had a £130-ish Abus chain which was snipped through like paper by a thief with a hench set of bolt croppers. They had targeted my bike specifically, and they came extremely prepared.

The only thing you can do is to make life as hard as possible for a thief, along with keeping your bike as discrete as possible. If you can park it anywhere less visible than the road (garden, shed, garage, driveway) you are already reducing your odds of theft. You should get an alarm/immobiliser too, look on eBay for cheapish ones. Many can be easily disabled, but if you can park your bike where you can see and hear it, you can improve your chances of catching someone if they do try something. Chain your bike to something immovable, like a lamp post, or invest in a ground anchor. You could look at Almax chains too. They are too heavy to take with you, but they are pretty much un-croppable. Sadly though, nothing will stop a scrote with an angle grinder unless you catch them red-handed.

One of the most useful things you can buy is a 24h monitored GPS tracker (such as Biketrac) and have it installed professionally; these can be removed by a thief once located, but if your bike is nicked, it will buy you some time to have the police help track it down before it is stripped down. These are quite pricey though.

In A Level we had two options, modern history or early modern history (also classics but that doesn't count do much in my opinion ) Modern History included civil rights in America as well as Russia in the twentieth century, Reformation in Britain and China under Mao.

true,BestFriendWatermelon,null,null,"It will inevitably sound spectacularly, unashamedly arrogant of us to say this, but British history is already exploding with great people and extraordinary deeds.

How much should we devote to each subject? British history (as compared with ancient history, which deals with the usual European bias Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, etc) is generally taught from 1066 to the aftermath of the second world war.

So to give 7 to 16 year olds a fairly comprehensive outline of British history, you really have to fit at least: 

* Norman conquest, including Battle of Stanford Bridge, Battle of Hastings, the Doomsday book, Norman castlebuilding

* The Crusades, including Richard the Lionheart, the siege of Damascus, fall of Jerusalem, krak des chevaliers

* Medieval England, including the Angevin Empire, Hundred Years war, the plague, feudalism, Magna Carta, Scottish wars of Independence

* Tudors, including War of the Roses, Henry 8th's wives, the protestant revolution, dissolution of the monasteries, establishment of the Church of England, Bloody Mary, Elizabeth 1st, Age of Discovery (Henry the navigator, Columbus, Magellan),Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish Armada

* Stuarts, including Union of the Crowns, the civil war, Charles 1st's execution, Oliver Cromwell's dictatorship, wars with Spain, France and Netherlands

* British Imperialism, including the Glorious Revolution, William of Orange, English subjugation of Ireland, Queen Anne, Act of Union, Hanoverians, the Jacobites, War of Spanish Succession, *13 colonies*, Battle of Blenheim, Peace of Utrecht, British trade dominance, wars in India, *seven years war*, *American war of Independence* Evolution of a constitutional Monarchy, *the slave trade*

* Napoleonic wars, including the french revolution, storming of the Bastille, Napoleon, Battle of Austerlitz, Admiral Nelson, the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar, Duke of Wellington, the Peninisula war, the Grande Armee, French invasion of Russia, the battle of Waterloo

* Age of Enlightenment, including the Agricultural revolution, Age of Enlightenment, Newton, Darwin, British Africa, Captain Cook, South Africa, the Mahdi in Sudan, Cecil Rhodes, British India, Queen Victoria, the great game, Crimean war, Zulu wars, the Boer war

* WW1, including Suffragettes, rise of Labour and the Unions, Irish independence, Triple Entente, Balkan Powderkeg, Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, Schliefen Plan, British expeditionary force, battles of Mons, Ypre, the Somme, Passchendaele, Jutland, Marne, Gallipoli campaign, Russian exit, *American entry*, Spring offensive, Tank warfare, Aerial warfare

* WW2, including interwar years, rise of Nazis in Germany, Communism in Russia, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Phoney war, Norwegian Campaign, Maginot line, Ardenne Offensive, Fall of France, Dunkirk Evacuation, Battle of Britain, the Blitz, North Africa, Operation Barbarossa, *Japanese and American entry*, Burma, V2 Rockets, *Normandy landings*, *war in the Pacific*, *Italy Campaign*, Battle of the Atlantic

(note the italics where America gets a sizeable mention)

etc, etc, etc. Mention goes to America where relevant. We don't pretend that our Allies didn't exist in WW2, nor ignore the war in the Pacific. Nor do we ignore the American war of Independence, but in relation to Britain's history it's only about a 1 hour lesson. We know who George Washington is, woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, because they affected our history. 

But schoolchildren don't learn about Jefferson, Hoover, or even Lincoln. Why would we? Around the time of the American civil war, Italy unified, Germany emerged as a great power, Japan underwent modernisation, Europeans scrambled for Africa, etc. Each of these, from our perspective, is just as significant as the American civil war. None really get inclusion in our history lessons. There's not enough time to fit in British exploits of the time, such as the New Zealand wars, the Afghan wars, the opium wars.

Somebody from China would be shocked that we don't mention the Opium wars in British history classes. There's so much going on, that even if we doubled the time devoted to history lessons, we'd still be filling it with more stuff left out of British history long before we felt the need to include the rest of the world's.

&gt;ISRAEL has long been protected by its famed “iron walls”. Now those walls have a rooftop. Israel’s arms manufacturers have devised an anti-missile system, offering what they call an “Iron Dome” overhead. Iron Dome’s manufacturers claim it is the fastest and most reliable such system to date, able to shoot down missiles with a launch-to-impact time of 15 seconds. The $1-billion programme, subsidised by the United States, has served Israel well in Operation Protective Edge, its recent campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Palestinian militants have lobbed almost 1,000 missiles into Israel, but **Iron Dome's interceptors have struck down 87% of their targets,** according to the Israelis, allowing life in Israel’s cities to proceed more or less normally.

There are two reasons someone might vandalise your bike - personal (maybe you pissed someone off), or impersonal (because they're the type of utter fucktard who will ruin your shit for the heck of it).

To avoid the first, try not to piss anyone off. To avoid the second, make sure your bike is ""out of the way"" - people are lazy and most of the time won't go *too* far out of their way - they'll just pick an easier target. Keep it off the road, out of sight, put a cover over it, etc.

You could set up a CCTV camera, but it might be better to focus on prevention - you might catch someone in the act on CCTV, but then you have the task of figuring out who the hell that person is.

**Theft**

The idea is to make the act of stealing your bike not worth the time/effort it will take to steal it - someone isn't going to want to spend ages angle grinding through a chain and sawing through a disc lock for some old rusted up cheap Chinese bike.

The first line of defence however is again to keep your bike out of sight. Nobody's going to nick it if they don't know it exists. You are going to be seen coming and going on it though, so nothing's perfect... but even a cover is better than nothing.

If you can afford it, and/or you have an expensive bike that's worth the effort to steal, buy an Almax chain, and a ground anchor if you don't have anything fixed to chain it to. (Even the best chains are useless if a couple of guys come along and lift it into a van.)

Alarmed disc locks are good in addition to the chain - as /u/j00pY said, having something through both wheels helps. Remember that an alarm is useless if you can't hear it though - say if you're listening to music, watching TV, etc. Alarms go off all the time and everyone else will just ignore it.

An immobiliser won't stop someone from lifting the bike into a van, but it might stop joyriders from hot wiring it.

Finally you have tracking devices, but these can be expensive and won't stop the bike being nicked in the first place.

Then there's the custom options - I'm currently cooking together my own solution: a custom alarm/immobiliser/tracking device. It has a tilt switch on it that will trigger a text message to my phone the minute the bike is taken off the centre stand, and will then start tracking.

*Anecdotal Thing*

If the police tell you to move your bike for any reason, say if it's an ""obstruction"", don't do it until you have another place to move your bike to. I made this mistake - and what you have to remember is that if the police *do* remove it, you actually have a chance of getting it back - which you don't if anyone else takes it!",0,1406917552,null,0,false,0,cje6tbo,t3_2ccl8b,t1_cje6tbo,t3_2ccl8b,null,1435019242,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

Check your contract carefully. If there's no specific mention of the post-dated cheques, refuse to pay this way. If there is, consult legal advice.

PS: incase it wasn't clear, your landlord is a crook. Expect a year of hell, with threats, angry phonecalls, your rights being walked over, landlord entering the property without the legally required [24 hours notice](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/housing_e/housing_renting_a_home_e/common_problems_with_renting.htm#h_the_landlords_rights_of_entry), changing the locks, etc.

You're right, we haven't seen enough of Frederick to say he's the better option. And he's not, at least defensively. But he can be.

**How do you think this season will go?**

There's still a ton up in the air as to how this season plays out. While we've had some very, very positive transfers, the rest of silly season has been an utter disaster. Our most promising player is in jail after beating up two women (allegedly). Our record transfer is on the shelf indefinitely for the second straight season. Our board is bickering with our gaffer. Our best player has been in a contract dispute all summer. It has been a mess. Judging by how things have gone, we could finish anywhere from 8th to 20th. That isn't an exaggeration.

**Which three players should other fans watch out for**

Cheikhou Kouyate, Winston Reid (if he stays) and Aaron Cresswell. Kouyate came from CL side Anderlecht and looks incredibly smooth, strong and purposeful. Cresswell was the best defender in the Championship the past two seasons and looks menacing going forward. Reid is head and shoulders above anyone else on the team talent-wise and is the most underrated CB in the Prem.

**How will they line up**

While most fans are calling for 2 men up front at times, we'll likely see the same 4-2-3-1 we saw most of last season.

**The Lineup**

GK: Adrian

LB: Cresswell

LCB: Tomkins

RCB: Reid

RB: Demel (with some Jenkinson)

CDM: Kouyate

Yes, he is inconsistent, but there have been many games in the past, even under BR where is the best attacker we have on the pitch. He isn't Pacheco or even Reina from 2 years ago where they simply aren't getting it done to an objective standard. Glen Johnson still has moments where he is a match winner. I don't even think he's been consistently bad for the last 2 years, only consistently out of form relative to what he's capable of.

I understand the heat a bit, I really do. He hasn't been as good as we would've hoped. Can you say Flanno has been, though? Is Glen any more inconsistent than Skrtel, who had an up and down season like I've not seen in a while? Skrtel's individual errors hurt the team immensely last year, relative to the way the league finished. But because he had some top performances, everyone has glossed over that.

Criticism is okay. You're right that top clubs have to be more ruthless with what they demand from their players. I just don't see the point in making a ton of snide comments (which you are only a drop in the bucket of, I might add, so I don't want to act like you solely go around talking shit about Johnson) about a player being on Liverpool because they aren't consistently good (or bad, I might add).",0,1406922863,null,0,false,0,cje9p7i,t3_2cb3v1,t1_cje9p7i,t1_cje8j8m,null,1435020636,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Exactly.

But why sell Chiriches, who to me (imo) has looked *very* promising, is more than happy with his role at the club and has spent one season with us. Musacchio isn't gonna be ridiculously cheap, especially after a great season this year and I can't see him coming purely to play second fiddle to Jan. Unless we move Chiriches into a DM role ;) I actually think dude has the technique to work there. Or unless we sell Chiriches for a ridiculous amount. Still makes no sense to me. 

This one makes zero sense to me personally? I'd rather we spent the ''Musacchio'' money on someone like Ranocchia, Loic Perrin, Matip, Doria,  - hell, even Fonte, Ashley Williams or Curtis Davies. Or just throw 30m at Laporte. The EPL is a different ball game defensively to La Liga where the ball is ping'd around more and technique is more valuable.

Our EPL coverage over the last 5 years has become incredible. Now that NBC(free over the air channel) has the rights we even have 1 or 2 games shown for free each weekend.

Manoeuvrability is important when you are defensive and that is the only time when it comes to be important. Manoeuvrability since helmet-mounted sights has become far less important in offensive situations, because with a helmet-mounted sight and an off-boresight missile you do not have to manoeuvre to somebody at 6 o'clock. You can actually shoot them when they are in your 6 o'clock almost—that is the difference. I would say it is a difference in what is important in air combat capability.

&gt; However, from the mid-20th century onwards, other historians became critical of even this nonjudgmental use of the term for two main reasons.[10] First, it is questionable whether it is possible to use the term ""Dark Ages"" effectively in a neutral way; scholars may intend this, but it does not mean that ordinary readers will so understand it. Second, the explosion of new knowledge and insight into the history and culture of the Early Middle Ages, which 20th-century scholarship has achieved,[39] means that these centuries are no longer dark even in the sense of ""unknown to us"". To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians avoid it altogether.[40]

&gt; Historians who use the term usually flag it as incorrect. A recently published history of German literature describes ""the dark ages"" as ""a popular if ignorant manner of speaking"" about ""the mediaeval period"", but then immediately (in the next sentence) goes on to use the term ""dark age"" to mean ""little studied.""[41]

Equally, I know bloodletting and witch hunting happened, but they continued until far later.  You still have heretics burned at the stake in Britain well into the 17th century for example, and the [Witchcraft Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_Act#Witchcraft_Act_1735) only started being about conning people rather than actually committing magical offences in 1735, at the start of the 18th.  The article you link about bloodletting goes on to mention that it's only seriously questioned at the start of the 19th century.

That's all I'm really disputing: the use of the outdated term 'Dark Ages' and the suggestion that bloodletting and witch hunting are somehow characteristic of it.  ",0,1406923847,null,0,false,0,cjea7u4,t3_2c8lbq,t1_cjea7u4,t1_cjdtd9b,null,1435020886,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Montero will start as a sub for either Routledge or Dyer. Will most likely replace Dyer as the season progresses. May mean Routledge switches to the right, but Montero also played on the right in Mexico.

I have a feeling Bony is going to be sold towards the end of the window. If so, straight swap with Gomis. Otherwise, Gomis will be brought on for a winger and we'll push Sigurdsson wide making it a 4-2-2-2 or normal 4-4-2.

I think this is the season where Ki starts taking on the Britton role. Meaning injuries/killing games off will dictate when Britton plays.

When rotating the CAM position with Sig off the field there are a few options.

* Shelvey as CAM, Ki and Britton at DM.
* Bony at CF, Gomis at ST.

I'm assuming DeGuzman won't be coming back.

The group work, it'll be something like building a tower with a competition between the two groups. Ignore the competition, what is important is communication with your team. Main points to remember in group work:
 is never shoot down someone else's idea. 
If someone in the group is quiet and not getting involved, talk to them, ask what they think, get them to contribute
Use the phrase ""&lt;Insert fellow person's name&gt; had a great idea, lets just build on that &lt;inset your own better idea&gt;
Never aggressively dominate the conversation, be heard but don't talk over others

For the structure interview, follow the STAR system. They'll ask you questions like ""Give me an example when you went above and beyond of what was expected of you"", the STAR response is S- situation, give the situation you were in, T- Task, what was the task that you were required to complete, A - Action, what action did you take to fix/tackle this? and R - Result, how did you action help improve the situation and Task

""He has one daughter, Melody Rose, born seven months ago after a brief relationship.

Sterling added: “Some of the stuff you see is unbelievable. I’ve read stuff that I’ve got five kids and another on the way. It’s just crazy and it’s completely wrong.

“I find it funny to even think about it. If you bite at it, rise to the bait, then it makes it worse.

""I just laugh it off about some of the stuff that people say.

“But I’ve got no regrets. It’s a difficult thing for me. I want to concentrate on my football because I’m so young. It’s probably taught me to be more professional in how I go about living my life now. That’s really important for me.”

The loans bit seems to be based around the idea that when you're born the government creates an account with something like £100m in it using your birth certificate as collateral. When you take out a mortgage, the bank gets the money from that account to give to you, so there's no need to pay them back. You're not reneging on a contract, because the bank is actually not out of pocket on the deal.

true,kde01,king,,"No thanks. We've just brought in Dier, have Fredericks around the fringes of the first team looking to break in, and we already have Naughton. Would rather keep Naughton, as he's much more reliable than Richards will be. If he leaves, I'd rather go with what we already have in an academy prospect (Fredericks) with a 3rd backup of Dier (who can play LCH, RCH, and LB as far as i know).

Risky business this one. And if we get him and sign him on a good deal just to watch him flop there's no way we'll be able to move him on...",0,1406925894,null,0,false,0,cjebai7,t3_2cd3wh,t1_cjebai7,t3_2cd3wh,null,1435021417,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3
