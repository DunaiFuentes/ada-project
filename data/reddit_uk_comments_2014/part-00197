true,1iam,rangers,,"We were basically pushed into administration by Craig Whyte not paying any taxes for much of his time at the club. He borrowed money from a company called Ticketus that, in return for several years worth of season ticket money, gave him enough to take over the club. The tax Whyte didn't pay added up to around £9m (I think that's the correct figure). Why didn't HMRC act sooner in issuing threats of administration? Whyte was allowed to carry on not paying any tax until it got to a ridiculous amount.

The EBTs had been hanging over us for a while at that point but as long as Rangers contested it it wasn't a ""proper"" debt, just something that could become a (massive) debt in the future if our appeal was thrown out. However, the phantom debt that HMRC hung over our heads for so long ended up damaging us because we couldn't attract any decent buyers, and so a guy like Craig Whyte comes along and wreaks havoc.

The situation now is that the people who set up the newco to take over the running of the club in place of the liquidated company essentially overspent massively and took a lot of money out of the club for themselves. Now some sections of the fans want the board out (they say they want assurances that Ibrox and Murray Park won't be sold, but there's a lot of different agendas), although the board itself is much different to the one that took over the club in 2012.

I think that's the most basic summary I can give you, but I'm not entirely sure if it's all accurate as it was a couple of years ago now.

&gt;___The Mists of Avalon___ is a 1983 novel by [Marion Zimmer Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Zimmer_Bradley), in which she relates the [Arthurian legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur) from the perspective of the female characters. The book follows the trajectory of Morgaine (often called [Morgan le Fay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_le_Fay) in other works), a [priestess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest) fighting to save her [matriarchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy) [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celt) culture in a country where [patriarchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) threatens to destroy the [pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_polytheism) way of life.  The epic is focused on the lives of [Gwenhwyfar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinevere), [Viviane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viviane), [Morgause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgause), [Igraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igraine) and other women who are often marginalized in Arthurian retellings. [King Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur) and the [Knights of the Round Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_Round_Table) are supporting rather than main characters.

Frankly the transfer committee has been playing football manager for the past 2 years, with the exception of sturridge and coutinho i think we have wasted a lot of money. Ilori, Aspas, Assaidi, Coates, Alberto, Allen and Borini (unlucky) thats about 200-300k in wages and 30-40m+ in transfer fees. Has anyone of these player had regular playtime or even first team chances with the exception of borini and allen. When they get chances it is in a odd cup game or 10 min cameos, you cant except a player who hasnt played in months to prove himself in 10 min cameo. We bought mignolet for 10 million when we had reina, tell me how does that make sense , you sell your first team player first or negotiate simultaneously, not buy mignolet and get stuck with Reina. 10 million was 25-30% of our budget for the year. Rodgers flat out refuses to play players who arent giving their 100% in training, then why buy these players when you think they arent good enough, or is he trying to prove a point to the transfer committee that its his team and if his targets are overruled this is gonna happen, i dont know.

Despite all this, this summer has been good for us, we have improved the squad. Lallana, Can and Lambert are good players and with lovren, markovic, another left back and bony or remy coming in, i think you are really underestimating us. We have an established system, coutinho, sturridge, henderson and sterling will get better this year, enrique is back and i think we have improved on all fronts except for loss of suarez. We have lost 1 player and will add 6-7 good players. We have Ibe, suso and texeira, who will want to do well and prove themselves. we may not win the league but you are underselling us if you think we cant compete or that we wont do well.

The people.

When you get tax revenue from them, and pay them back in jobs, that's really just redistributing money, not creating new wealth. This is why economies that rely too much on government jobs collapse. Look at Greece. That's exactly what happened.

They pumped up the economy with debt and creating unsustainable government jobs. It's the private sector that keeps the country going. That's where the real money is made.

No. They mostly understand that it represents the ideas people had at the time, that it's an ancient text and shouldn't all be taken literally.

Same with Muslims.

true,G_A,NoBike,'06 SV650s,"Couple of things regarding the second point.

250s and 300s are very common recommendations over in /r/Motorcycles because they don't go through the process of the L plate with a 125, then a restricted license at 33 or 46 bhp, and then finally the full license after two years.

Because of that, there's very little small displacement street bikes sold in the States. In Europe, we've loads of 125s, but very few &lt;500cc bikes.

On-top of this, looking for a modern 300cc bike is just going to hurt the bank even further. All modern 300s are very new, even buying new is going to be costly and as you pointed out, your first bike should be one you can drop without crying.

Assuming you are viable for DAS ( based on your desire to start on a 250 ), I'd suggest looking at a bike like the GS500 as a starting bike. Very reputable, time proven machines. Nothing fancy about them, they get the job done, they happen to be perfect for the 46bhp restricted license without a restrictor meaning you might find one from a training school with lovely framing around it further protecting the bike, and they're of the lowest insurance group in that displacement range.

Alternatively, the common step up from a 125 in the UK is a 650 twin. Kawasaki have their strong finance plans for both variants of their ER6, you've Suzuki's SV650 also in both faired and non-faired variants, or you could look at something more adventure styled such as the Versys or the V-Strom.",0,1405058721,null,0,false,0,ciu9s62,t3_2adtb4,t1_ciu9s62,t3_2adtb4,null,1434659115,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

Not really debatable. Özil is definitely world class. The best part of his game is he works in the shadows. You don't realise how essential he is until he's not there anymore. I assure you he'll have a much better season with Walcott and Sanchez there now. He relies on other players runs so he can pull off the famous passes he is known for. The injuries to Ramsey and Walcott were when the major criticisms started coming in and it's no coincidence. He needed them.

&gt;Yes

Wow. You are actually reasonable with one of them.

&gt;Definitely not.

Why not? He had a superb season, Arsenal's horrible medical team fucked him over once his crazy stamina ran out and he slotted right back into the side and won Arsenal the FA Cup. To come back into a side straight away and perform is the mark of a world class player. If he has another season like that again I don't see how you couldn't call him a world class player unless you were intentionally trying to discredit Arsenal players like you are.

&gt;Can't even make the Germany starting 11. Hummels and Boetang are world class, Mertesacker isn't.

*Boateng first of all. And what are you talking about? He was Germany's starter when they came into the world cup. He had to be taken out of the squad because of the flu that spread around the German camp affecting 7 players. Mertesacker may not have the pace, but he has the brains of a world class defender.

&gt;The same Koscielny that Sakho (not world class) bullies out of the France team?

Koscielny is clearly better than Sakho it's just that Sakho scored a goal to get France qualified for the world cup so Deschamps overrates him. Once Deschamps realised he made a mistake Kosc was right back in the side and performed admirably. He put Sakho back in the next game and what happened? France went out of the world cup.

&gt;That's like saying if Pato didn't have glass ankles he'd be good too.

But Pato has terrible injury struggles. Walcott got an ACL which can happen to any footballer. He doesn't have a history of injury. If he performs like he did in his last full season then he will be world class.

You can be biased all you want and underrate our squad however much you want. At the end of the day even with your complete discredit of the Arsenal squad and overrating of your own squad Arsenal still comes out top with more world class players and there's more signings to come. This is only the beginning of the post-stadium debt era for Arsenal.

He operates primarily as a [midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder) and is comfortable at playing both in attack and defence.  Pogba was described by his former club [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.) as a ""powerful, skilful, and creative"" player who has ""an eye for goal and a penchant for the spectacular"".  After his transfer to Juventus, he gained the nickname *Il Polpo Paul* (""Paul the Octopus"") for his long legs that look like tentacles during tackling or running.  He received the [Golden Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Boy_(award\)) award for 2013, given to the best under-21 player in Europe.

Q: What would happen if the angels did get inside the box?

A: It was briefly explained in the episode.  The Angels consume time energy as their ""food"", and the more time energy they consume, the more powerful they get.  If they got into the time machine, they would be treated to a big buffet of time energy that could make them powerful enough to do massive damage to the solar system (""switch of the sun,"" as the Doctor puts it).  In later episodes, we find out that consuming time energy allows them to breed and also distort and scramble time.


Q: What would happen if you were to break the statue, if you could break it at all?

A: The Doctor explains briefly that ""you can't kill a stone.""  Basically, you can't break them.  It's elaborated on in a later episode when we see that inflicting scratches is about as far as you can get.

Q: When will I be able to sleep again?

Also, a bit more info on metadata:

A German politician recorded all his metadata, and you can play through the visualisation and information of it here:

http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention/

You can learn quite a lot about him and his movements, and I'm not even sure this data includes the source or destination of communications. With those, you'd have a pretty clear picture of what was going down, and exactly how to get more information.

And also the obligatory quote from the former director of the NSA, Michael Hayden:

[""We kill people based on metadata""](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/06390427191/michael-hayden-gleefully-admits-we-kill-people-based-metadata.shtml)

So anyone that tells you metadata is harmless remember: sure, it maybe harmless for you - ""if you've got nothing to hide..."" but you best make sure you don't do something wrong, or the government doesn't quickly change it's mind over what's right or wrong, otherwise your metadata could, in albeit incredibly extreme cases, lead to your untimely demise.

A common response to this is ""but I trust the government"" and I would be lying if I said I didn't have some faith in the current government - I think we're lucky to live in a *relatively* civilized and democratic country. However, trust must be a 2 way thing, and the blanket collection of all metadata for everyone, has not only been ruled [an interference of our fundamental rights to privacy and data protection](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=req&amp;docid=150642&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=313776), but also suggests that the government do not trust us.",0,1405063529,null,0,false,0,ciub5d3,t3_2acxk8,t1_ciub5d3,t3_2acxk8,null,1434659841,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

In the long term you will be paying interest on your mortgage and interest on the borrowed money. Not good.

Saving the grant on the other hand is a great idea as that money is yours to keep!

If you want to improve your financial situation, and save for buying a property, the first step is to cut your living costs, live frugally and save that money. Money you earn honestly has no strings attached once it hits your account.

Apart from Sturridge, Coutinho and Sahko it would be hard to say that any of the other signings have made a positive impact over what we already had.

I think Lallana will be one to add to that list and Lambert may prove a decent addition.  

We just don't seem to be able to attract proven talent to the club as has been seen with Sanchez. Whether that is because of financial constraints or other reasons is hard to tell.

true,Thetonn,null,null,"The Tories tend to stand up for private business, make concerted efforts to ensure they are economically strong and growing. They try to encourage higher levels of investment by private companies and particularly foreign ones and tailor their economies around them. Ultimately, if what you care about is a growing private sector and more money for the country being generated in the long run, they are your guys. They tend to try to solve the worlds problems by changing the incentive structures which lead to those problems, which is less invasive but less effective.

Labour tend to stand up for the public sector. Nurses and teachers and the like will tend to get higher wages under their plans, and more state investment in the public sector happens under their watch. The problem is this money has to come from somewhere and that tends to be higher taxes or higher borrowing. This can be really good, or problematic depending on your views on Keynes and Friedman.

The Lib Dems are intended as a happy medium. They want to facilitate economic growth to help the poorest in society. They also have a broad coalition of generally populist policies that they support, such as getting rid of university fees, getting rid of the lowest tax threshold and reduced nuclear weapons. The problem with them is that they are a much smaller party and can only get power through coalitions where they have to compromise. Naturally they will have to give away a lot; and they aren't that good at preparing people for this as it would harm their short term electoral chances. They tend to be the easiest to support because you can plausibly claim they believe anything and one of them would, and they are the least obviously corrupt.

UKIP are a radically populist party which has collected a number of populist ideas which a number of people care about, like Grammar Schools, lower taxes and disenfranchisement from the EU and Westminster, and attached them to the policy of leaving the EU. They want this for many reasons, such as using the funds in question to provide social policies they like in the UK and creating a much more internationalist rather than continentalist policy. Most of their supporters are nice and not racist but are tarred by a number of bad apples which resulted from their small party status and problematic recruitment policies.

""Dear Rt Hon Alistair Darling,

I write to you with concerns over the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill currently being put before Parliament.

The blanket retention of data; phone calls, text and internet search history, has long been a clear violation of innocent peoples civil liberties, and the European Court of Justice clearly agrees having repealed this regulation. It is clear that the government, and anyone who supports this legislation, does not support the right to privacy, and cannot be trusted to uphold the civil liberties of this nation.

The new laws being voted on are far from transparent and there is not an open debate taking place to discuss their merit. This leads me, and many of my peers, to conclude that short term security and the interests of a minority are being prioritised over the long term security and civil liberties of the people in this country. We believe there is significant danger of this irreversibly damaging the UK's integrity and principles of fairness and democracy.

I am deeply troubled by the Westminster Parliaments disregard for the democratic process and a citizens right to privacy. This episode will give me plenty to consider before the referendum on the 18th September.

The addition of a striker, who's primary focus would be to put chances away, might be the scoring outlet needed, to replace the 31 goals and 13 assists, provided by a certain someone in the previous season.

Let's face it, there's probably not a single player out there, who could make up for the lack of statistical efficiency when our current #7 leaves. Therefore making up for those goals and assists will have to be a team effort. In terms of assists the team might need another addition to improve the creative spark. Lallana is a very good start, but surely we'd need someone like Shaqiri or Griezmann, maybe Marković to further our teams ability to break past defenses and create goals. It also helps to have a focal point of such an attack.

While Sturridge is an outstanding striker, placing sole responsibility on him for the entire season is very risky. Lambert has proven quality and will surely chip in with some goals, Borini had a decent season at Sunderland, but we'll want to add some more quality to our striking team. Bony ticks many boxes in terms of quality and ability. He's very athletic, technically proficient,  has a great awareness inside the penalty box and would not cost an arm and a leg to obtain. The only concern is, were his 25 goals previous season a one off, or is there permanent quality there, maybe even a bit of room to improve.

Liverpool will be a significantly different team next season. Not only because of the players coming in, the departures will affect this as well. It's pretty clear the team will need another striker and another attacking midfielder. For me, Bony and Shaqiri would be the optimal additions. Previous season LFC did very well not only because of individual technical and athletic qualities, the mental ability of the individuals and consequently the team as a whole were outstanding. Rodgers is surely aware of this and is likely looking to add players who are mentally on par with the rest of the team.

I'm all for things like MacMillan nurses, say, and things like the Red Cross probably get you much more bang for your buck in terms of improving human well-being.  Christ, millions of people still die annually from things like malaria and dirty water, which are far cheaper to sort.  As far as I'm aware, cancer research charities rake in billions annually and all we have to show for it over the last decade or so is a few highly specialised drugs which can maybe tack a few extra months onto the lives of people with specific diseases.  Most of the advances in cancer treatment seem to have already happened, and it's very much diminishing returns on investment these days.

Another problem is that it's hard to decouple things like earlier detection from increased survival rates from new treatments, as [this article](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-early-detection-of-cancer-and-improved-survival-more-complicated-than-most-people-think/) explains rather nicely, so it's very difficult to quantify benefits.

I'd much rather focus charity money/energy on things like improving human welfare in poorer areas by improving public health (the single biggest driver in improving human lifespan), infrastructure.

true,Quagers,null,null,"&gt;aggressive marketing of high-calorie foods and wholesale reductions in day-to-day physical activity.

We are aggressively marketed at for lots of things, cars, pay day loans, even health foods! Doesn't mean you have to go out and buy them, for me that is a personal responsibility issue every time not societies one.

&gt;People didn't just suddenly lose their willpower 40 years ago!

I am not saying that, I would say that it requires more will power to stay fit now than it used to, certainly more day to day concious thought. (I don't like using 'willpower' since those that rely on it to lose weight normally fail.) However thats not insurmountable and I don't think that means that normalising surgical solutions is the answer. 

Few things from that paper, firstly it looks at people who are already overweight, who intrinsically will find it harder to keep weight off. Thats no problem with the paper, its what they are looking at, but it means if you are using it to support 'no one can maintain lower weights' you have to include all the people who are at a healthy weight the whole time.

Secondly the key bit in the abstract is,

&gt;successful long-term weight loss maintainers (average weight loss of 30 kg for an average of 5.5 years) share common behavioral strategies, including eating a diet low in fat, frequent self-monitoring of body weight and food intake, and high levels of regular physical activity. Weight loss maintenance may get easier over time. Once these successful maintainers have maintained a weight loss for 2–5 years, the chances of longer-term success greatly increase.

Which is basically saying that a much higher percentage of people who adopt good healthy strategies do succeed. So we come back to education and personal motivation. 

You can chuck out all the physiological reasons you like but the simple truth is if that was the case no one would be able to stay healthy. The fact that a large proportion of the population can brings us right back to personal responsibility.

1.

This is the best case scenario, but also highly unlikely.

2. Paul Dacre goes to court to stop people taking photos of him, and wins, setting a precedent about paps and public figures which can then be used by others to get paps to stop annoying them.

3. Paul Dacre goes to court and loses, allowing the Kickstarter-funded Pap to continue irritating him. The high profile nature of the trial brings awareness to the general public about the invasive nature of the papparazzi, which may then result in slightly improved laws governing some of their activities and thereby protecting the privacy of individuals and their families.

4. Worst case scenario, nothing changes, Paul Dacre is annoyed for a year or flies to the Caribbean to avoid things, but then it's over and nobody really cares and nothing happens as a result, but it does sow the seeds of change for when circumstances allign some time down the road.

&gt; First of all, none of the story is factually true. Amal's mother is not Druze. She has not been to Beirut since Amal and I have been dating, and she is in no way against the marriage — but none of that is the issue. I'm, of course, used to the Daily Mail making up stories — they do it several times a week — and I don't care. If they fabricate stories of Amal being pregnant, or that the marriage will take place on the set of Downton Abbey, or that I'm running for office, or any number of idiotic stories that they sit at their computers and invent, I don't care.

&gt;But this lie involves larger issues. The irresponsibility, in this day and age, to exploit religious differences where none exist, is at the very least negligent and more appropriately dangerous. We have family members all over the world, and the idea that someone would inflame any part of that world for the sole reason of selling papers should be criminal.

&gt;I'm the son of a newsman; I accept the idea that freedom of speech can be an inconvenience to my private life from time to time, but this story, like so many others, is picked up by hundreds of other outlets citing the Daily Mail as their source, including Boston.com, New York Daily News, Gulf News, Emirates 24/7 and so on.

&gt;The Daily Mail, more than any other organization that calls itself news, has proved time and time again that facts make no difference in the articles they make up. And when they put my family and my friends in harm's way, they cross far beyond just a laughable tabloid and into the arena of inciting violence.

&gt;Dear Mr. XX

&gt;Thank you for your email. I wholly share your concerns on the proposed Communication Data Bill.

&gt;I believe it is important that the police and security services can keep up-to-date with modern technology, however this bill is too widely drawn, is unworkable
and gives far too much power to the Home Secretary without proper safeguards.

&gt;I am very concerned that this Bill would give wide ranging power to the Home Office, provide far too little protection for people’s privacy, and include no proper safeguards over cost.

&gt;It is astonishing that the Home Office have had so little discussion with the internet companies who need to deliver this legislation. It is vitally important that if such legislation is introduced that there should be a new round of consultation with technical experts, industry, law enforcement bodies, public authorities and civil liberties groups.

&gt;I will be writing to the Home Secretary to urge her to re-think this Bill and have a more thorough consultation on communications data and the Communications Data Bill.

What could be more authoritarian the the extremes of corporate capitalism right wing pseudo-""libertarians"" from the American tradition want?  Their calls for a sort of capitalism on steroids, inspired as they are by the malevolent astroturfing PR-led propaganda of ultra-neoliberal thinktanks, would see most of the world's population living under a sort of neo-feudalism as corporate serfs.  Anyone who studies history (as these sort of people clearly do not given how ahistorical their positions are), will be aware that freedom is proportional to property, indeed property might be said to _be_ freedom, and such a system as theirs which is steeped in historical State-sponsored theft and murder, and grounded on exponential growth and ever increasing inequality, must necessarily lead to increasing authoritarianism.  And history shows that it has, whether it's private capitalism or State capitalism.

&gt;Allowing people to keep their own money is not a subsidy, whatever other advantages they get from services provided by the state as a result of other tax. 

Of course it is.  They are subsidised relative to those others who have to pay the taxes to maintain the services they use.  If corporations don't pay their taxes, workers have to make up the shortfall, and yet the corporations make far greater call on State services to protect their interests (these days, as democracy goes down the pan, they pretty much run the State to serve their needs).

&gt;If a company wishes to operate in Britain, where services such as transport and healthcare are monopolised by the state, there is almost no choice but to use those services due the lack of viable alternatives. Some businesses would no doubt not be viable without that state intervention, but most would find other accommodations and adjust their price accordingly. 

There's a statistic out there which I'll look out if you want it which shows, either for FTSE100 or Fortune500 corporations, that about half have been saved from bankruptcy by the State during their history and almost all have received some substantial form of largesse.  If you look at corporate interests in the UK, a significant and growing proportion of them make more than half their turnover from the State trough.  Under any genuine model of private enterprise, these corporations would not be considered private, and yet they are being used to enrich private individuals.",0,1405075912,null,0,false,0,ciudme5,t3_2abtbx,t1_ciudme5,t1_ciud5r9,null,1435474461,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;That a statue from a memorial was mounted on a bonfire.

It was mounted on a pallet at street level. You're filling in blanks with assumption, doing LADs work for them.

&gt;&gt; You're blinded in that case. And giving a pro loyalist view has now been elevated to 'defend active paramilitarism'? Wise up.

&gt;Woah woah woah. I wasn't talking about giving a pro-loyalist view, I was talking about flying paramilitary flags.

Nobody I know supports paramilitaries or their flags. Bit by bit they'll get removed from parading life. But that's same on both sides. Besides, bad as it is it's not 'active paramilitarism' - that would be killing/maiming people, another thing many accounts here conveniently gloss over.

&gt;Have you considered that that's because the majority of unionism isn't doing anything wrong, and oddly enough that's not newsworthy? 

You make this point on a sub that routinely posts 'nice bakery on the lisburn rd anyone?' 

The point is bad news stifles normal newsworthy stuff from developing. That Lanark Way bonny had a continuous stream of people coming from outside the area to get their picture with it. There are various events connected with Orange Fest. No one wants to see that when it's wall to wall on some bullshit instantly taken as fact.

&gt;Either it's okay to burn people or it isn't. 

Wat. Burning people is bad m'kay? The IRA did enough of that. Go ahead, ask Anderson - it was her main life achievement when being selected to stand for election by the liberal SF.

&gt;And can you honestly not see a difference between flying a KKK banner and reorganising a flag timetable in the city centre? 

Oh right, so this entire flag thing is being represented by one single piece of cloth that, much like the statue, no one knows who actually put up and which dominated 'discussion' here for one fucking day.  Never has so much political capital been wrung out of a 4x3. The alliance botherers were out in force with their cocks firmly in hand on that one. Plus their bedfellows the perpetual 'end all loyalism' Republicans. You'd think the 'middle' would catch themselves on.

I thought we were discussing the flags on the bonfires. Doing stuff to flags is a political statement, just like taking the national one down from a public building.",0,1405078370,null,0,false,0,ciue4pj,t3_2a8iw4,t1_ciue4pj,t1_ciudi74,null,1434661426,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,MGharibian,newcr-6,"suffering at the hands of Martinez' evil twin, Fartinez","I live in California, but a lot of my family live in london and are chelsea supporters so for my whole life i was a default chelsea supporter. That is, I never watched a game but just kind of went along with the chelsea crowd because that's where my family was. Then I watched a single game and was upset I had ever worn the jersey– it was no heart, hike it to drogba, ugly football. So then I decided that if I was going to put on a jersey again, I wanted it to represent me in some way, my personality. 

I started checking out Arsenal, because my best friend and his whole family were crazy Arsenal supporters, coming from the dad since he lived in Iran. They even had a red and white car. I immediately didn't like them either upon watching them. There's just something that sort of *clicks* with that team that your heart is aligned with, no matter how much you fight it. I've seen that manifested in a lot in supporters of the big 4– semi glory hunters who have clicked with let's say, West Ham, but always fight it and try to force their heart on Arsenal. Can't work.

Anyway, the kind of person I am, I look for heart in a team, and I quickly realized that the way the EPL worked, the heart was pretty concentrated in those teams trying to breach the top 4 but not quite there yet. That was Everton and Spurs. I started watching the games, and I liked Kaboul and VdV and Benoit and Bale and such, and I actually  even went to watch one of their games against the LA galaxy, but it didn't take long for me to recognize that this wasn't the team for me. There was no loyalty, no history– this wasn't a *club* fighting to be in the top 4 like I had thought, but a group of *individual players* fighting to do so while wearing Spurs shirts. It seemed like whenever the players got good enough to rise, they did so as fast as possible, while leaving Spurs behind. 

Then I found Everton. A club with a rich, beautiful history, known for being warm and passionate, with players fighting to raise the name, with players staying at the club because they truly loved it. Baines was a great indicator of this for me at the time, best left-back in the world (if you count lahm as a right back) and he stayed with Everton because he loved it. I started the next season watching a ton of different games, but it didn't take me long to realize Everton were my team. The rest is history!

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"From an anthropological viewpoint, the words that the English use define their class and background.

There's a great book on this called ""Watching the English"". It's an anthropological study of the English and it covers the use of the terms ""dinner"" and ""lunch"".

A (horror!) Daily Mail article references this: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2608173/So-CLASS-YOU-A-wickedly-funny-perceptive-new-book-answer-hinges-favourite-marmalade-buy-M-S.html


&gt; Dinner/tea: Nothing wrong with this word: it’s only a working-class hallmark if you use it to refer to the midday meal, which should be called ‘lunch’. Calling your evening meal ‘tea’ is also a working-class indicator: the higher echelons call this meal dinner or supper. But the uppers and upper-middles use the term supper much more than the middles and lower-middles, rarely describing an evening meal as ­dinner unless it’s a particularly ­formal occasion — and never, ever using the term dinner party.
For the higher classes, tea is taken at around four o’clock, and consists of tea and cakes or scones (which they pronounce with a short o), and perhaps little sandwiches. The lower classes call this afternoon tea.
All of which can pose a few ­problems for foreign visitors: if you’re invited to dinner, should you turn up at midday or in the evening? Does ‘come for tea’ mean four o’clock or seven o’clock? To be safe, you have to ask what time you’re expected. The answer will help you to place your hosts on the social scale.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; What could be more authoritarian the the extremes of corporate capitalism right wing pseudo-""libertarians"" from the American tradition want? Their calls for a sort of capitalism on steroids, inspired as they are by the malevolent astroturfing PR-led propaganda of ultra-neoliberal thinktanks, would see most of the world's population living under a sort of neo-feudalism as corporate serfs. Anyone who studies history (as these sort of people clearly do not given how ahistorical their positions are), will be aware that freedom is proportional to property, indeed property might be said to be freedom, and such a system as theirs which is steeped in historical State-sponsored theft and murder, and grounded on exponential growth and ever increasing inequality, must necessarily lead to increasing authoritarianism. And history shows that it has, whether it's private capitalism or State capitalism.

I could equally point out that revolutions that endow states with extensive powers (French, Russian, Chinese) tend to lead to periods of incredible violence and often mass murder. Freedom is indeed proportional to property, so having large amounts of property in private hands is a key way of limiting the authority of the state. 

&gt; Of course it is. They are subsidised relative to those others who have to pay the taxes to maintain the services they use. If corporations don't pay their taxes, workers have to make up the shortfall, and yet the corporations make far greater call on State services to protect their interests (these days, as democracy goes down the pan, they pretty much run the State to serve their needs).

Is there an example of this you can think of? The greatest public expenditures tend to be on pensions, the welfare state and healthcare, none of which is of peculiar advantage to a corporation. 

&gt; There's a statistic out there which I'll look out if you want it which shows, either for FTSE100 or Fortune500 corporations, that about half have been saved from bankruptcy by the State during their history and almost all have received some substantial form of largesse. If you look at corporate interests in the UK, a significant and growing proportion of them make more than half their turnover from the State trough.

So far as I can recall, saving a firm from bankruptcy is generally defended as being in the public interest for reasons of jobs or financial stability.

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"I have some issues with what he says.

As he says, the amount of money donated to charities in the US has stayed at 2% of GDP since 1970. And yet he only just said about how successful his organisations were in taking the high advertising route.

He's doesn't demonstrate any evidence advertising actually grows the total amount of money donated to charities, rather than redistributing it to those charities that spend more on advertising.

If it's a zero sum game, then charities spending on advertising, and overheads such as ""the magic of the experience"", only succeeds in reducing the amount of money that's actually spent helping people.

I agree that charities shouldn't be afraid of spending money on big projects, or over many years, or ""losing"" money on unsuccessful projects, but I think comparisons to the private sector are flawed.

Private sector ventures are profit making. You invest money in a venture that will sell goods and/or services, and will generate a return on your investment. If you're a successful investor that same money can be invested time and time again in many different ventures and it will grow.

That doesn't apply to charities. The money you donate doesn't grow, and you don't get to give it again, it's been spent. You hope it will benefit society; which is why people are so reluctant to see it spent on overheads and advertising, particularly if it's spent on advertising to you, the person already giving.

If it is very hard to increase charitable giving overall, as it appears, then spending 40% of funds raised on overheads, is a real waste of resources. If every charity increased spending on fundraising by 40 percentage points, would the level of donations increase by 40%? If yes then his plan for charities running high overheads is an effective strategy for society as a whole, if not then he's wrong and his critics are right, he is a parasite.",0,1405079142,null,0,false,0,ciueb4q,t3_2aetov,t1_ciueb4q,t1_ciud0zg,null,1434661558,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

That is completely incompatible with the argument that it is a physiological effect which we can do nothing about without surgery. As is the fact that 20% of obese people do manage to keep their weight loss off, if it was physiological that number should be practically 0.

&gt; Pretending that advertising isn't manipulation of individual choice is to ignore the billions spent on it worldwide because, surprise surprise, it works.

I think there is the old adage which is very appropriate here ""If someone told you to jump off a cliff, would you?"". Blaming advertising is a weak attempt for individuals to avoid taking responsibility. Companies have no intrinsic desire to sell you junk over healthy food, they make money off either. They respond to what the consumer wants, advertising is to make you buy their junk instead of someone elses.

Last Updated: 10th July 2014

NIGHTMARES of Brazil’s horrifying World Cup exit could haunt me for quite some time.
I am still coming to terms with my nation’s 7-1 mauling at home to Germany — and even now the memory of it sends a shiver down my spine.

It was very, very difficult to sit through and it will take years to forget.

Nobody expected it. And to see the tears on the faces of the fans and players alike as the disaster unfolded shows just how much of a shock it was to us all.

For Brazil to have won the World Cup on their home turf would have been incredible. And to have missed out — especially in the manner that we did — has left every one of us heartbroken.

Blame should not be apportioned to individuals, though.

My pal David Luiz came in for some stick but, until that game, he had been undoubtedly one of the best players at the tournament.

On Tuesday night, it was more a case of everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong.

Once the second goal went in, there was real loss of belief and this is the only way to explain shipping four goals in just six minutes.

It was ugly but, in fairness, our style of play throughout the whole tournament was not all that pretty either.

We could not keep the ball and play as we wanted. There was something not quite right — and we’re not sure why.

Which makes it all the more baffling considering how fantastic we were at last year’s Confederations Cup, where we romped to the title.

We must improve but that does not mean we must copy the Germans’ style.

As impressive as they were, it is not as if they have changed the way the game should be played.

Their success is a product of players working with each other for several years, who now have an almost telepathic understanding as well as super ball skills.

You can see how strong they are by the fact they have reached the semi-finals in their last four major tournaments and I believe they will win it now.

I got quite a lot of stick at Tottenham training yesterday from German midfielder Lewis Holtby in particular.

But he knows as well as I do that it was a freak result — and if this Brazilian team is given more time to gel they can come storming back in competitions to come.

After all, it is not just through luck that we are five-time world champions!",0,1405080265,null,0,false,0,ciuel8p,t3_2acs63,t1_ciuel8p,t3_2acs63,null,1434661774,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

true,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"&gt; 28million people manage to keep to a healthy weight.

Nah, it means 1/3rd of people in the UK are a healthy weight.  Overweight is associated with increased risk of many health conditions.

&gt;That is completely incompatible with the argument that it is a physiological effect which we can do nothing about without surgery.

i didn't say we can't do anything about it without surgery, just that surgery is highly, highly effective vs 20% effectiveness for conventional weight loss programs

&gt; As is the fact that 20% of obese people do manage to keep their weight loss off, if it was physiological that number should be practically 0.

No, it means that 20% of people are able to keep it off, for whatever reason.  All physiologies are different, due to genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences.  For example, I research the impact of maternal obesity on offspring.  If your mother is obese during pregnancy, you have a greater risk of developing obesity and metabolic disease in adult life. 

&gt;I think there is the old adage which is very appropriate here ""If someone told you to jump off a cliff, would you?"". Blaming advertising is a weak attempt for individuals to avoid taking responsibility.

But they're not asking people to jump off a cliff - they're asking you to pretty please buy this chocolate bar they've put right by the till and advertised to you since you were a toddler.

&gt;Companies have no intrinsic desire to sell you junk over healthy food, they make money off either.

They don't, but that's what people want, as a direct result of their evolved physiologies - in case you didn't notice, fatty and sugary foods taste good, hence why the clampdown on fats in foods backfired with the rise of added sugar to replace fats.  They then have an intrinsic desire to protect their own interests, which are heavily invested in these unhealthy foods - it's very telling that ""personal responsibility"" is a phrase parroted by Big Tobacco, Big Alcohol and Big Food to avoid taking corporate responsibility.

Bottom line is that even if you disagree with the ideology of bariatric surgery, it's the most cost-effective method of inducing persistent weight loss and the reason it's being expanded is as a public health response to a massive public health problem.

On the face of it we WANT 4th and nothing below that is good enough. Simple. As. But really, if we finish 5th (or even 6th if its a competitive year) we are quick to admit are faults and begrudgingly take it. However, AVB changed all of this. In a sense it's probably the most spurs fan have been confused in a while. He was young and so ambitious with great ideas. This caused a lot spurs fans to relax a little if we didn't finish 4th with him at the helm in the first season, which we didn't. Then the second season came where so mnay new players were bought, again confusing things. This then created a new set of expectations where some were, again, ok with us finishing outside the top 4, as AVB is *still* young and had to cope with a huge intake of new players but a majority (by a small margin) were getting frustrated and wanted 4th again, which AVB was not delivering. With Sherwood yes it is a ""unique case of alienating everyone.""

To really answer your question: No, the fans nor Levy will turn on Pochettino in the first season, that I guarantee.

If I have to do anything involving the DWP where they're likely to fuck me about or give me the run around I contact the DWP then immediately follow-up with an e-mail to my MP. It's a surprisingly effective way of avoiding problems and I've had issues brought to the attention of Iain Twatface-Smith.

I've recently had to do this to claim the Severe Disability Premium as I'm on support group ESA and also receive middle-rate care component DLA, live on my own and no-one receives Carer's Allowance for me. I only found out about the Severe Disability Premium because someone in the know told me - there's absolutely on mention of it on the Gov.uk website (let alone how to claim it) and Jobcentre Plus don't seem overly willing to tell anyone about it.

It also turns out that trying to get the form off the DWP to claim it (IS10) is a nightmare with people chasing them for months and never receiving it before eventually giving up.

I'm not saying that there's a deliberate policy to try and avoid paying out the Disability Premiums to ESA claimants but given that the premiums are cumulative, with the Enhanced being about an extra £15 per week and the Severe being an extra £60 per week on top of that, there's probably a hell of a lot of people not being paid money they're entitled to because the Government and DWP appear to go out of their way to hide information about it.

I live in a nationalist flashpoint, just finished working off the fall two weeks ago and now work in east Belfast. What I've noticed is that loyalist's don't take their flags down, they just don't and it looks really ugly. Other areas have flags around Easter then take them down, some random bars like The Felons have flags all year round but the entire areas isn't painted and flagged up. I find it really uncomfortable getting to work and taking the bus past say, freedom corner. 

I get annoyed that there will be tyres burned in estates near me that I'm going to have to breathe the fumes off. If anyone challenges that, or anything to do with bonfires, or try to stop a march from causing a riot, a big huff is thrown by politicians and community leaders. My uncle is a fireman and has been for years. If another Protestant neighbour of theirs rings and say's they think the bonfire will be unsafe, he goes out to assess it and gets a load of shite and abuse if it is in fact unsafe.

I have zero trust in the DUP. I have Protestant friends and now work mates that have zero trust in the DUP. They don't care about the people at all. Shortage of blood donors? Let's not let gays give blood in case they have AIDS. March can cause a riot and result in injuries/millions spent in policing and clear up? We're not even going to discuss this like adults! Bonfires cause air (and noise) pollution? So fuck, if you don't like it you clearly hate anyone with Protestant/ Unionist/ Loyalist background.

It's a complete joke. My familys business is in an industrial estate quite near Mount Vernon.. EVERY YEAR something is stolen from the car park around it for bonfires. There were two years in a row where the actual signs were taken because it's a Catholic owned business. The police did shit all. My dad got annoyed and said he'll take them back himself (signs for a warehouse aren't cheap, and neither are pallets), and was told he'd probably end up being arrested for inciting violence.

The UK Population is 68mil, 28mil is roughly 1/3, I used your stats (although admittedly I did make a basic maths error of doing 1 - 0.66 = 0.44, so the actual number is 22million)

&gt;All physiologies are different, due to genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences.

Basel Metabolic rate, the energy you expend at rest, has been found to differ by only ~20% (&lt;500 calories) in most individuals. Physiologies are different yes, but not so different as to make it impossible for most people to lose weight if they adopt a healthy lifestyle. All these things you mention may make it harder for some people than others but not physically impossible, they are not excuses.

&gt; they're asking you to pretty please buy this chocolate bar they've put right by the till and advertised to you since you were a toddler.

Thanks for the perfect example, it is the parents responsibility in this situation to ensure their child eats healthily, toddlers don't have bank accounts or cook for themselves, it is solely the parents responsibility. (and just FYI, most supermarkets have signed up to a charter to stop doing this)

I am not against bariatric surgery in extreme cases where people have repeatedly refused to lose weight, clearly it is the common sense approach to reduce long run costs. What I disagree with is that 'obesity is a disease' or biariatric surgery becoming anything other than an option of last resort, thankfully I'm glad to see that that is aligned with NICE's view,

Some goes on administrative staff and managers. And yes, you do need them and no, volunteers won't cut it.

Some goes on computer systems and other office stuff. Again, IME, the bare minimum.

Some goes on paying people to move sorted, donated goods around from shop to shop within a region if it's not sold the first time, take rags to a rag dealer, and to deliver leaflets and the like. Every pound possible is squeezed out of donated goods.

true,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"&gt; Basel Metabolic rate, the energy you expend at rest, has been found to differ by only ~20% (&lt;500 calories) in most individuals. Physiologies are different yes, but not so different as to make it impossible for most people to lose weight if they adopt a healthy lifestyle. 

I fully appreciate this; however, there is far more to net weight gain than basal metabolic rate.  A healthy lifestyle involves maintaining physical activity and eating healthily - the majority of genes associated with obesity do so via increased appetite, be it via increased sensation of hunger or reduced satiety.

&gt;All these things you mention may make it harder for some people than others but not physically impossible, they are not excuses.

And that is precisely my point!  Over a period of decades these things drive obesity - the ""path of least resistance"". Net daily energy gain in the US is only ~20kcal a day, for reference.  It's the small differences that add up. 

&gt;Thanks for the perfect example, it is the parents responsibility in this situation to ensure their child eats healthily, toddlers don't have bank accounts or cook for themselves, it is solely the parents responsibility. (and just FYI, most supermarkets have signed up to a charter to stop doing this)

I was aware; the fact that they've banned it demonstrates its power, as does the scaling back of advertising of junk food during kids TV.  You are severely underestimating ""pester power"".  

Anyway, my point wasn't about kids buying junk food, but the power of advertising to alter consumer choices and negate educational efforts.

&gt;What I disagree with is that 'obesity is a disease' or biariatric surgery becoming anything other than an option of last resort, thankfully I'm glad to see that that is aligned with NICE's view

Please, please, please back that up with some evidence, anecdotal or otherwise. I'll tell you now, that is complete nonsense. Are you talking about the flying of the Union flag on designated days, in line with the rest of the UK, as recommeneded by the EQUALITY commission? Or are you talking about his defense of residents of North Belfast? His objections to the re-routing of this 1 stretch of road on a very long parade, a parade which is one of THOUSANDS? 

If Sinn Fein is trying to ""wipe out every ounce of Britishness"" from Northern Ireland, where are there more flags in Sandy Row than there are on Windsor Castle? Why are there more OO parades than at any time in history? Why is Martin McGuinness shaking hands with the Queen of England?

This notion that republicans are trying to erode Britishness is a complete non-sense and a manufactured myth. These are facts.

Tell me about the endemic racism, xenophobia, homophobia, bigotry and 19th century conservatism in Nationalism.

Tell me about how the Nationalist and neutral political parties turned away a world renowned mediator because they couldnt make ANY concessions.

Tell me about how the Nationalist and neutral political parties threated the institutions of democracy because 1-2% of the population wanted to bang drums and play whistles down one stretch of road.

These are facts. This notion that ""we're all as bad as each other"" is untrue and unhelpful.

Populist Unionism is a disgrace and i truely, genuinely feel sorry for those Unionists that don't care for racism and bigotry, don't care for the Orange Order, the Unionists that want a properly effective political representation for the things that matter.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; I think convincing the electorate that paying people who don't work, even if they're not disabled or just having a run of bad luck will be a much harder task than UBI advocates seem to think.

Sure, it's not an obvious ""of course we should do that"", but then neither was legalising homosexuality, introducing an age of consent, stopping child labour, creating universal suffrage or Magna Carta. All of them required work. Some more violent and focused than others.

&gt; Take drugs policy for example, there are numerous examples from around the world that show that our current policy is outdated and we'd be better off replacing it. Apparently if you ask the electorate what they think of people who take drugs, they'll say they should rot in jail.

About a third of the adult population in the UK have taken drugs at least once in their life according to most studies.

I don't think a third of the electorate thinks they should rot in jail, and most of them likely tried it and decided it wasn't for them. They would probably prefer not to have a permanent criminal record for it, and would likely think others shouldn't either.

Of the remaining two thirds, about half of them probably don't think people should rot in jail for taking drugs. Combined, they are enough to reform drug policy in the UK.

The problem is the other third that agree with the sentiment that this is all very evil: they're the ones who vote.

Convincing the people who vote that they have the power to fundamentally change society in remarkable ways is the challenge. That's the only challenge.

Enforce the law. Have councils take down illegal flags, with PSNI protection if necessary. If the majority of the people agree that they have no place on the streets, why are they allowed to remain in place?

&gt; Get involved in their community, reach out to others, develop trust, seek understanding, breakdown barriers?

&gt; Or say 'I fucking hate the lot of them' on the internet.

Of course the latter isn't constructive. And the latter is easier said than done. If someone turned up at the Sandy Row bonfire in a GAA top offering to help out, I can't see it turning out well. It's this self-fulfilling prophecy of making outsiders unwelcome and never learning to empathise with alternative viewpoints. The people who are out there 'mixing' are probably not the ones making generalisations.

&gt; Rioting generally considered a bad thing, when did I say otherwise? Happens when either side doesn't get their way, an issue cemented by the parades commission. I don't attempt to label the people of Ardoyne scum though.

I agree that the Parades Commission needs looking at. The way it operates on a case-by-case basis feels a bit medieval, but there's no crossparty consensus on the principles by which they should operate. That reform can't happen until the unionist parties go back to the negotiation table. 

The thing is, we share a culture that has a lot of UK elements, a lot of uniquely NI elements, and a lot of Irish elements. Haass was attempting to shift the balance point to include more aspects of Irish culture, which haven't been represented outside the nationalist community. But, Haass failed to recognise what a huge change that would be, and he wanted to move far too quickly. 

Nationalism needs to be doing more to depoliticise aspects of its culture and make it more acceptable to their neighbours, e.g. create incentives for GAA clubs to rebrand if they're named after a militant. There was a piece a while back about people from traditionally unionist backgrounds learning to speak Irish, and that was great to see.

Yes it is. It is the very definition of racist that we base the decision entirely on where you come from. How is it that a Chinese wife of a Brit with a PhD can't come in, but an unskilled European can come and bring their entire family? That's totally non-sensical.

&gt;Being in EU gives positives for both ways as in EU nationals can come here easily, while British can do so the other way round. 

And yet NET immigration to the UK still keeps piling up. More people come here than British people leave. Maybe it's because we are the best and more desirable country in Europe to live in. You yourself are a Polish immigrant, and since you could have moved anywhere in Europe but chose here, you must agree ;)

&gt;As a Brit you can't migrate without any problems to any non-EU country.

And that is entirely up to those countries to decide. But fwiw, if you have the skills, qualifications and money, it's not that hard to get into most countries.

&gt;Because suddenly you can wake up, say ""I want to live in France"", buy a ticket and simply live there, without any burden of bureaucracy? In fact, you can even visit a country during holiday and decide ""I want to stay here"" and that's it.

There are times The Daily Mail will report actual facts that other newspapers will leave out - often because perpetrators of certain crimes regularly fit certain stereotypes and papers like The Guardian and other left-leaning organisations like the BBC want the public to believe these stereotypes are not possibly true.

The complaints about The Daily Mail and The Sun usually come from The Guardian readers. What you need to understand is that The Guardian is a left-wing tabloid. It's publication roll is even more predictable than The Daily Mail. Let me give you a menu of every single Guardian paper in the last year:

* outrage
* socialist outrage
* black outrage against the white man
* unionist rage against the capitalist
* anti-Tory stories
* more anti-Tory stories
* Labour-are-heroes stories

Is this balance? Of course not!

He was scuffling before Tim and was probably not pleased at yet again having to be out on the left but his form dropped noticably once Tim came in the manager slot.....whatever Tim was selling, Jan clearly wasn't buying. I genuinely think he was bothered by the fact that we had put an amateur in charge of the squad, this is a guy who came out of the Ajax system and who was accustomed to a certain level of professionalism and preparation....last season it seemed like we threw both of those things out the window (Hugo's comments about the setup seems to confirm this) and Jan clearly was bothered by it.  

I think Jan looked at that and his reaction was effectively to shut down.  Not the most desirable reaction but not an unheard of reaction in athletes, or for that matter normal people, when playing/working for someone they genuinely don't respect or like.

As for selling him, regardless of what you think of him, i just don't know that we can afford to do so.....The pricing on CB's this summer is staggering (in part thanks to the mop-headed mistake waiting to happen being sold to PSG for stupid money), Lovren looks like he will land at LFC for £20m-£25m, Mangala is rumoured to be valued at £40m, Benatia will be on par with Mangala, Marcos Rojo (who isn't nearly on par with any those players) is being talked about at ~£15m.....Jan in form is just as capable of any of these CBs and if we sell him....we won't be able to bring in a player of a similar calibre, not to mention we will then be looking for 2 CBs who are capable of being 1st team and would have to be integrated into the squad. 

I think we would be much better off holding onto him and letting Poch have a chance to reinvigorate Jan.

Is it worse than not being able to support your family? 

&gt;And this is a fact? According to who exactly?

For a start, anyone who makes their living with a trade, such as builders, carpenters, electricians, plumbers ect... 

&gt;And do you think that even if that was true the money ""saved"" on cheap employees went exactly where? To Cayman Islands? It wasn't put back into economy or lead to opening of new work places? 

What a load of rubbish. Sorry you lost your job to a person who will work for half what you usually earn, but don't worry, your supporting the British economy. The multi billion pound construction firm you used to work for makes more profit now. 

&gt;What about reducing certain prices, which I am sure many Brits were keen on having, like fixing a pipe in their house for not rip off price

A lower price doesn't always mean a better price. You can buy ridiculously cheap cloths from Primark, but there is a cost to that, namely the enslavement of the people who made your cloths. You can get cheap prawns from Tesco, but they were probably caught on what is essentially a slave ship. 

Sometimes things cost money for a reason, it's not a rip off, its the value of the service, but all most people can think about is how much it will cost them, not how much it costs other people. If you are living in a 3 bedroom house with 10 other builders, and sending your wages home each week to a country where they will stretch 10 times as far as they do here, you can afford to work for less than the person living in this country, struggling to provide for his family.

&gt;Build more houses! Also, don't tell me that 1% increase in population somehow lead to housing crisis, as this is exactly the number of citizens from the biggest A8 country.

How many more houses, 100,000 per year? 200,000 per year? How do you predict how many houses you will need if you have no control over how many people can live here. 

When 200,000 people are coming to this country every year it is going to cause strain on the housing market, and infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. We don't have spare infrastructure just lying around unused, most is already at capacity so numbers like this are causing problems. 

&gt;So? Is this such a bad thing? The UK is already a nanny state and you want to make it even more? Globalisation leads exactly to changes like that 

Yes its a very bad thing if you put any value on community, on a sense of belonging somewhere, like many people do. People who's family have live in the same town for hundreds of years having to leave because they cannot but a home there any more is disgraceful, and a huge sign of a problem within society. It has nothing to do with being a nanny state, its about not ripping families apart, its about being able to live near your elderly parents so you can look after them in old age, and so that they can see their grandchildren, and help to raise them. 

&gt;people change places of work, skills and place of living. Just look at the USA.

People should choose these things, not have them forced on them. When you say look at the USA, I assume you mean in the depression era sense, where people were forced to travel around the country by sneaking onto steam trains, following the harvests for work and living out of bindles.

&gt;

&gt;Though mainstream nationalism in Wales has been constitutional, there have been violent movements associated with it. In 1952 a small [republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism) movement, *Y Gweriniaethwyr* (*The Republicans*), were the first to use violence when they made an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport) leading from the [Claerwen dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claerwen_dam) in [mid Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_Wales) to [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham). 

&gt;In the 1960s two movements were established in protest against the drowning of the [Tryweryn valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryweryn_valley) and the 1969 [investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_of_the_Prince_of_Wales#Investiture_of_Charles.2C_Prince_of_Wales): [Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudiad_Amddiffyn_Cymru) ('Movement for the Defence of Wales', also known as MAC) and the [Free Wales Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Wales_Army) (also known as FWA, in Welsh 'Byddin Rhyddid Cymru'). MAC were responsible for numerous bombing attacks on [water pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pipelines) and [power lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission) across Wales. On the eve of the investiture two members of MAC, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, died as the bomb they were planting on the [railway line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_line) to be used by the [Royal Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Train) exploded.

&gt;The late 1970s and the 1980s saw an organisation calling itself [Meibion Glyndŵr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meibion_Glynd%C5%B5r) (*the sons of Glyndŵr*) responsible for a spate of [arson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson) attacks against [holiday homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_homes) throughout Wales. In the 1970s, a Welsh Socialist Republican Army arose, whose initials in Welsh spelt out the English word ""DAWN"".

true,MrSqueegee95,lfc68,,"&gt;I like Bony but with all attacking mdf's looks like it will be one striker most of the time Sturridge main man, so price important.

This is exactly it in my opinion, if we can get Bony for around £15m then great as we have a brilliant back-up for quite cheap.

But I would much rather us sign a player than can play striker and also play wide, Sanchez was someone who could do this but we missed out on him, Suarez could and that's why the SAS worked so well.

I am excited about Markovic because I think he will be a brilliant purchase and will be a quality player, but I would also like us to sign someone like Griezmann who can play wide and as a striker.

I also think a lot of people are putting success down to the players too much, if we can play the style we played last year I don't understand why we can't be successful. I don't think we will win the title or challenge for it, but top four and I would call that a successful year as we would have the resources to build on the squad we already have. Our most important person is Brendan Rodgers, he is young and is improving season by season and I have complete trust in him.

We don't have to beat Chelsea/City/Arsenal/United to get in the top four, obviously it helps but we don't have to. With the way we play we can beat most of the lower teams and still get top four, and getting a more solid defence will help that.",0,1405085107,null,0,false,0,ciug4qr,t3_2af8jn,t1_ciug4qr,t3_2af8jn,null,1435474317,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

I'd see it more as trying to have an equal playing field, heritage-wise, rather than wiping it all out - that'd be impossible to do and in my own opinion that whole theory comes from those who brand themselves in the 'PUL' community.

Was thinking about this in another thread. I think nationalists are pleased to have the Irish aspect of our culture legitimised in any way. This happens to come at a time when Orange culture is being criticised and asked to compromised. That doesn't make for a concerted campaign against unionist culture, rather a recognition that one 'side' has been overrepresented in the past and redressing that balance.

Of course we have many aspects of British culture, as well as aspects of Irish culture - bear in mind that 100 years ago, there was no contradiction in being an Irishman and a British citizen.

We stayed in one of those wee terrace houses off the Lisburn Road while our house was being done up. My dad thought it'd be nice to bring me and my little brother to watch the bands. 

All was well, until we got back to he house. We could go up an alley to the back of the house, but there was a group of men pissing up against it. When he got to the front of the house (I remember this all so clearly), there was a man squatted on the footpath taking a shit. So, my dad walked to the front of the Lisburn Road and found 3 RUC officers. He told them what was going on, they seemed interested enough and went to take a statement or report, I don't know but one had a little note pad anyway. Then they asked his name. My family have Irish names, and I remember all three men turning round again. They completely ignored my dad. When we got back to the house, trying to avoid all the waste, we stayed inside until the crowds had left and my mum and dad got out the bleach and buckets of water. 

So for me, I can't fathom the idea of the 11th or 12th being a shared cultural, family event. The idea just doesn't work.

Another difficulty claimants can face. WCA descriptors are only published in DWP documents that're aimed at professionals and contractors. Can't have claimants understanding on what grounds their eligibility is being judged. And then they need to understand the descriptors.

Personally I'm pretty lucky as my GP used to work for the DWP (he got out a long time before ESA though as even then he felt he wasn't actually helping people and was under pressure to not award incapacity) so knows all the buzzwords and understands what information to include in supporting evidence.

They would see each other, would make the journey every few months (they would buy as much time as they could with the little money they had), they would communicate over the internet, by telephone … but it would not be the same. So there would be only one way to battle the inertia of events and the decisions of adults. And that was by training. Like never before. Luis was playing in the Nacional youth set-up and, if he made it as a professional footballer, later he would have the chance to go and play in Europe, and that way he would be closer. That's the way he had to do it. And he had to start as soon as possible.

&gt;""That was when I really realised that if I wanted to be close to her I'd have to work hard. I'd have to wake up. So I set to work much harder than I needed to. I wasn't free to go there nor her to come here because of the money situation. So I had to train to the max to be able to succeed in Europe.""

1. Bony (and Davies, and Vorm, and Michu) = wanted by other clubs. No shit. All quality first team players when healthy.  

2. I believe GM when he says no offers have been received. Teams might have called and inquired about each player, but if GM says no formal offer has been received, then I believe it.

3. I believe our club has a price we're looking for in each player. As it stands, we have a strong club intact that is ready and capable of a top 8 finish in the league, and maybe more. Why do we need to sell?

4. I believe those prices are what other teams have inquired about, and they're skeptical because our prices are high. Our prices are high because we don't need to sell. 

5. If our players have buy-out clauses (like Bony's reported 19 mil), I think it already would have been matched. 

6. My guess is the club is wanting about 25 mil for Bony, 12 for Davies and 8-10 for Michu. Clubs aren't willing to match, and that's why no moves have been made. We're simply asking for too much. 

Of course, it's all speculation. We could sell all four players by the end of next week. If we do, it's because GM and company think the price is right. So far, that hasn't been the case.

It's kind of the same issue with people calling for a star striker. It looks more and more like Brendan favours a 4-3-3 with the option of occasionally the 4-4-2 diamond and thus any striker we brought would either replace studge, which won't happen or would have to be happy sitting on the bench a lot.

City/Chels can pay those players £150k to sit on the bench which softens the blow, we can't.

No issue with that.

I genuinely don't like that he shut down under Tim, but i fully understand the reaction.

My whole stance on the situation with Jan is that we are not in a position to unload a player of his calibre. We are likely moving Dawson which already leaves us looking for a CB capable of playing in Poch's system which is proving to be an expensive endeavour, and we aren't trying for someone on the level of Jan.  

Assuming Dawson leaves and we were to sell Jan we are left with Kaboul (who is injury prone), Vlad (who certainly seemed to have a few appearances that were similar to Jan in terms of focus), meaning we would need to chase at least 2 if not 3 CBs....In a market where Lovren is £25m, Luiz is £40m+, Mangala and Benatia are £35m+ and even a player like Rojo is £15m we aren't in a position to just rework our entire defence or more importantly *improve it* in a single summer and expect it to perform at the level we need.

And the immigration is causing that?

&gt;What a load of rubbish. Sorry you lost your job to a person who will work for half what you usually earn, but don't worry, your supporting the British economy. The multi billion pound construction firm you used to work for makes more profit now.

One view, which can very well be called rubbish. You are somehow assuming that all migrants work for half the normal wage and that all migrants work in places where big company makes extra profit. Don't you think something simply MUST be wrong with your assumption?

&gt;A lower price doesn't always mean a better price

Of course but it doesn't always mean it must be something worse! Good that you noticed the Primark and Tesco's prawns. How many people complain about it? Nearly nobody? Yet, Primark is increasing its profits and people love it. Why? Maybe because people aren't really interested in certain things as long as these don't touch them personally (even in theory).

&gt;If you are living in a 3 bedroom house with 10 other builders

And you suddenly assume all migrants live in 3 bedroom house with 10 people. Have there been any study regarding that? Maybe it is a problem seen higher than natives but I wouldn't assume something marginal as being a norm, as then I would say that all Brits are lazy and live on benefits.

&gt;How many more houses, 100,000 per year? 200,000 per year? How do you predict how many houses you will need if you have no control over how many people can live here.

It is easy to predict, only the government isn't smart enough to do that and simply should try a bit more.

&gt;When 200,000 people are coming to this country every year it is going to cause strain on the housing market,

How much time do you need to build a new school? I saw one being built in basically few months. It's also not that somehow 200k people moved to one city, they usually distribute quite well among whole UK, making 1-2 extra child places in certain school, not whole class.

&gt;Yes its a very bad thing if you put any value on community, on a sense of belonging somewhere, like many people do

Seriously, do you know at least one person who has most of his family/friends in one place and they all have been staying there? It's often the completely opposite case, when people move places to get out of that community.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;It's because we have open borders and hundreds of thousands of people from Europe come here

And hundreds of thousands of Brits migrate from UK to Europe. What's wrong with that? Even more people migrate to the UK from non-EU countries but that suddenly isn't an issue?

&gt;Read the massive thread two days ago where people have wives and husbands from outside of the EU who have MAs and MScs but who can't come into the UK. People are separated from their family for years because the current system is so fucked up.

What's that got to do with the EU people? 

&gt;It is the very definition of racist that we base the decision entirely on where you come from. How is it that a Chinese wife of a Brit with a PhD can't come in, but an unskilled European can come and bring their entire family? That's totally non-sensical.

Why haven't you made a comment regarding the commonwealth? If we go with your thought, then the UK should also quit from the Commonwealth to treat all people ""equally"".

When you are a part of an organisation you can very well be treated differently as this is a perk of being in such. Ukraine isn't in NATO, hence Russia could fuck with them. Should Ukraine sue NATO for not defending them?

And the same applies to non-EU migration. They need to apply for a visa just like you have. In the EU both countries don't have to do that. Also, you seem to forget that many similar agreements exist around the world. For example Australia and New Zealand have free movement between themselves. Bloody racists!

&gt;You yourself are a Polish immigrant, and since you could have moved anywhere in Europe but chose here, you must agree

Language! I've learned English at school and at private lessons. If I knew German I would probably (I learnt it a bit in school but hated it) I would migrate there as I could visit home country easier.

Fun fact - I came here on student visa, before the A8 expansion. It was hard but possible. What I've noticed is that there were many EU migrants who were working illegally. Since the EU, they don't bother working illegally. It isn't a completely valid argument but gives a certain point of view, that building borders and still having people who don't add anything may be worse than the EU-type solution - although obviously that increased numbers of migrants.

&gt;More people come here than British people leave

Take into account that this can change. UK is already losing land to the sea ;)

&gt;But fwiw, if you have the skills, qualifications and money, it's not that hard to get into most countries.

But if you don't? Don't forget about Brits who don't have either of that, yet they still has a chance to migrate in the EU without any problems.

&gt;I don't believe that very rare occurrence and flexibility is worth the massive price we pay

Massive? Isn't anything positive coming from EU migrants or the EU itself? I think you are too much one sided here.",0,1405089497,null,0,false,0,ciui2gw,t3_2aei71,t1_ciui2gw,t1_ciufw61,null,1434663414,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"You're right, you didn't comment our transfer market activity, you just sort of vaguely mentioned that we need to get to the point where we can afford players. But, if you can't spend enough to attract top players, which we clearly can't (whether directly or indirectly), then you have get it right far more often than not in the transfer market. I don't think that's really very possible and especially not for a club that can't spend a boatload on players (big money transfers are the easiest to get right).

Yeah, I concede that there is no script, despite how important money is. But that is a rather hopeful, and I feel a bit delusional (not intended in an insulting way) point of view.

Honestly, what Arsenal did with the Emirates will not happen for us. I feel extremely confident in saying that. They built an entirely new stadium and they have, by a wide margin, [the most expensive average season ticket price in the EPL](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/19/premier-league-ticket-prices-club-charge-the-most). They are £255 more per ticket than Tottenham, the second most expensive, and £275 more than us, the third most expensive. Looking at individual tickets, our cheapest single ticket is £38, which is far more than Arsenal's at £26. But our most expensive ticket is £74 less--over less than half as much--as Arsenal's at £52, while AFC's is £126. FSG have come out and said that ticket prices will stay the same or lower with th redevelopment, so we can't expect anywhere near their increase in revenue.

Overall, I guess I just see a massive flaw in people pointing out how we need money to get success, need success to get money. I understand it is a vicious cycle and all that, but why some think it's still possible for us to ever become like United or Real or Barca is beyond me. It simply won't happen unless we're willing to spend mountains of cash and violate FFP. Clearly, we aren't (and it's probably best fitting with the ethos of the club).

true,bottomlines,null,null,"&gt;And hundreds of thousands of Brits migrate from UK to Europe. What's wrong with that? Even more people migrate to the UK from non-EU countries but that suddenly isn't an issue?

NET immigration is +200,000 this year alone.

&gt;What's that got to do with the EU people?

It has absolutely everything to do with EU people. Net immigration of 200,000 to our small country is absolutely mental and unsustainable. But we are powerless to stop EU immigration, so the only way to keep the total number down is to be very harsh on non-EU people. Otherwise we have totally open borders and the total would be far, far in excess of 200,000.

My argument is that if we got rid of the open borders with the EU, we could have a much fairer immigration policy which would assess people on what they can bring to the UK, not simply where they were born.

&gt;Why haven't you made a comment regarding the commonwealth? If we go with your thought, then the UK should also quit from the Commonwealth to treat all people ""equally"".

I'd say the exact same about the commonwealth too. We shouldn't be forced to have open borders with anybody we don't want.

&gt;When you are a part of an organisation you can very well be treated differently as this is a perk of being in such. Ukraine isn't in NATO, hence Russia could fuck with them. Should Ukraine sue NATO for not defending them?

A bit of an abstract point. The fact is that the UK is a strong, rich and desirable country. So open borders really don't work in our favour as much as a ""proper"" immigration policy would. As for protection from war, again we can form any military treaties and alliances we want with whatever countries we want. That's not really related to immigration.

&gt;And the same applies to non-EU migration. They need to apply for a visa just like you have. In the EU both countries don't have to do that. Also, you seem to forget that many similar agreements exist around the world. For example Australia and New Zealand have free movement between themselves. Bloody racists!

I am not forgetting that. The example you named is silly. Australia and NZ are roughly equivalent countries. However the UK is significantly more attractive, and just outright better, than most European countries so the circumstances are very different. Also, did an anti-Australian party recently get almost 40% of the vote in Australasian continent elections? I don't think so. Popular opinion is now going against open borders with the EU and it has been going that way for 10+ years.

&gt;Language! I've learned English at school and at private lessons. If I knew German I would probably (I learnt it a bit in school but hated it) I would migrate there as I could visit home country easier.

Bingo. Our English language is yet another reason why people want to come here. 

&gt;What I've noticed is that there were many EU migrants who were working illegally. Since the EU, they don't bother working illegally.

It's a very good point, and definitely a plus side from immigration. I'd rather have people working legally and paying tax than not. But there's no reason we can't change our immigration policies AND hammer employers who are caught hiring illegals. I'd happily propose that the employer pays a £100,000 fine for hiring an illegal immigrant. That would put people off pretty quickly.

&gt;But if you don't? Don't forget about Brits who don't have either of that, yet they still has a chance to migrate in the EU without any problems.

Well that's fine, but again we would be free to form any new agreements we want with individual countries in the event of ending the open border system.",0,1405091658,null,0,false,0,ciuj6f7,t3_2aei71,t1_ciuj6f7,t1_ciui2gw,null,1434664016,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then you dispute it afterwards... Or not, because the school did nothing legally wrong in this case so disputing it is just a waste of every-bodies time.

I do think that the governments obsession with banning children from going on holiday during term time is ridiculous nannying, but in fairness, to get a criminal record for this you need to: 

1. Either not ask the headteacher for permission to take your child out of school or ask and then get denied, and go on the holiday anyway.

2. Get issued with a £240 fine and not pay it, despite obviously having the money as they've only recently gone on a holiday to Australia..

3. Get issued with a court summons and other legal threats and still refuse to pay the fine.

There's being stubborn and then there's just being stupid. Right now people have to accept that if they take their kids out of school without permission, they have to pay the penalty. They should factor that in as part of the cost of the holiday. Fair? No. Common sense? Yes.

I chalk his passing inaccuracy up to not playing with those players regularly. Outside of the Ayew brothers, Ghana had a lot of trouble getting the ball to flow freely from one player to another. Their offense looked clunky, and the only reason they were in games was their athleticism.

But speaking of athleticism... Atsu is a FREAK. He's fast. He's strong. He's a capable dribbler. Would absolutely add an element to our attack we're currently missing.

I think he'd be an upgrade over Jarvis, and probably better than Downing, considering Downing plays a more ""attack-minded"" midfield role and only managed a single goal last season. I know, I know, Downing was pretty unlucky to only get one, and he didn't exactly play poorly, either.

true,user24,,I got flair!,"My biggest advice would be: Treat your savings like any other bill; set up a direct debit from your current account to your ISA and just forget about it. If you save £50/month, that's £1800 extra saved by the time you finish uni (assuming 3 years). It means that if you need to go over you'd got to specifically go into your internet banking and cancel the DD that month, which makes you think more about it.

1. I'm on repayment plan 1, so not sure how much of this applies to you, but I'm not paying mine off early. It doesn't count towards my credit score I don't even feel it coming out because it comes out automatically through PAYE. Also, you only have to pay it back once you hit a certain threshold, so it's not something you have to worry about for a while.

2. Compartmentalise your budget into what you actually spend. Always be reviewing it. I use cash for everything that's not a bill. I find it helps me be disciplined about how much I'm spending. YMMV. The biggest thing here is to make sure you treat food money as entirely separate from general living money. That way you never go hungry. I literally have envelopes of cash with labels like ""Driving lessons"", ""Shopping"", ""Swimming"" etc on them, and keep my spending cash in my wallet. I top them all up to the calculated amounts at the beginning of the month. Any surplus either goes on a takeaway or is saved... usually the takeaway ;) You don't have to go as extreme as that of course, but just getting into the habit of seeing some of your current money as reserved for X, Y and Z can be really helpful.

3. no idea ;)

4. This is entirely your call, and depends how much risk you're willing to take. I am quite risk averse with money so mine is just in an ISA.

5. You've got about 20% of your assets in shares; that sounds fair to me.

6. Yes, but be careful you don't lock money away that you might suddenly need. A few months isn't going to make much difference in the long term, that's why I like ISAs, they're separate from your current accounts but they're not completely inaccessible.",0,1405093143,null,0,false,0,ciujz46,t3_2ace4n,t1_ciujz46,t3_2ace4n,null,1434664424,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Yeah but I never said we could become like that. They've got years of development behind them, while relative to them, we don't. Perhaps its a long, long term goal but I don't think its reasonable honestly.

What I do think is that we can break the vicious cycle of ""you need success, to bring in money, and money to bring in success"" by investing in our matchday revenue. Its something we can control, and isn't influenced by success, as the desire for tickets will always be there barring anything ridiculous happening.

It's the [Just World Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis) - the idea that the world is fundamentally just and fair, so if something horrible happens to someone then they must have deserved it somehow.

I don't know why it's such a common, popular fallacy but I suspect it's because it absolves adherents of the requirement to empathise with the unfortunate - if you automatically, *instinctively* assume that everyone who deserves sympathy must deserve what they get then you don't have any inherent moral obligation to care about them, sympathise with them or spend any time or money or resources to help them as one human being to another.

Equally, it also has to be a lot more comforting to believe you live in a universe where if you don't eat babies or rape a nun then you're guaranteed to be ok, compared to a universe where you might still go bankrupt, lose your job or get hit by an a meteorite *whatever* you do.

Oddly enough, the Just World Fallacy also works the other way as well - [as people get more wealthy or successful](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/social_darwinism_and_class_essentialism_the_rich_think_they_are_superior.html) they typically start to view themselves as ""better"" than poorer people - smarter, more intelligent, more deserving, etc.  That trend also typically holds true whether their wealth or success comes from personal achievement or skill, or merely change (eg, winning the lottery).

Nonsense.

Generally poor behavior, but not indicative of every individual member of the order. Not to mention the horrible relationship between the two communities anyway.

Civil and religious liberty for ALL, that what we promote and stand for, whilst also staying firm to our own religious beliefs. The qualifications of an Orangeman does condemn bigotry, which is read at every meeting and to all new members, the degrees of the order condemn bigotry also. Then there are lodges all around the world, (including places that were never British Colonies) I hardly think our Brothers from Ghana would accept the term racist.

A political battle that secured the civil and religious liberties won in 1689, some of which James II had removed from Protestants during his reign, solidified the role of parliament and had a greater effect on Europe and further afield than it ever really had here.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;NET immigration is +200,000 this year alone.

Both EU and non-EU. I don't know how many Brits left for the EU.

&gt;Net immigration of 200,000 to our small country is absolutely mental and unsustainable

63mln citizens - second largest in the EU. Germany has even higher immigration (if I remember correctly). UK isn't also a ""small"" country in relation to its size.

&gt;I'd say the exact same about the commonwealth too.

You, personally. Farage wants tighter ties with Commonwealth countries.

&gt;The fact is that the UK is a strong, rich and desirable country. So open borders really don't work in our favour as much as a ""proper"" immigration policy would

Yet, the UK isn't the only rick and strong country in the EU. Also, the EU's point is to raise standards among all EU countries and that can already be seen with the A8 countries, only after 10 years after their accession. The point being that the EU wants for all EU countries to be strong and rich.... but that obviously takes time and isn't guaranteed.

&gt;However the UK is significantly more attractive, and just outright better, than most European countries so the circumstances are very different

Not really. For example, why 1.5mln Brits reside in Spain? Also, western and Northern European  countries are quite strong as well.... while at the same time new opportunities are opening in those ""less attractive"" countries and I bet more and more Brits are taking these into account.

&gt;Also, did an anti-Australian party recently get almost 40% of the vote in Australasian continent elections? I don't think so.

I don't follow Australia's politics but UK was always an outsider of the EU, hence no wonder anti-immigration and anti-EU approach while global crisis kicks in.

&gt;Bingo. Our English language is yet another reason why people want to come here

At the same time UK is earning quite a LOT because of that fact that English became universal language. Not saying about the fact that it is getting more and more often than an English person doesn't even have to know local language when moving or migrating overseas in the EU.

&gt;But there's no reason we can't change our immigration policies AND hammer employers who are caught hiring illegals. I'd happily propose that the employer pays a £100,000 fine for hiring an illegal immigrant. That would put people off pretty quickly

Does even death penalty bare people in the US from committing serious crimes? In fact, they have one of the largest crime rates but other things sum up to that as well. The point being, there will always be an illegal market, hence why in US from time to time they allow for the illegal immigrants to change their status as they know it is probably a wiser move then to have them on the sideline of the society.

&gt;Well that's fine, but again we would be free to form any new agreements we want with individual countries in the event of ending the open border system.

And that would take ages. Just look at simple things. How long did it take for the whole EU to reduce and eventually remove roaming charges in the EU? Knowing that EU countries could be really pissed off on Britain (they may think Britain quit due to ""being better""), very few would be happy to sign any agreements soon after.",0,1405094765,null,0,false,0,ciukue6,t3_2aei71,t1_ciukue6,t1_ciuj6f7,null,1434664927,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Oh and ignore the hype about London, it's just as bad there, in fact it's probably worse.  As you've been out of the country for a few years most employers will see that little sentence and throw your application straight in the bin.  You'll have to take a much lower paying job first and apply for higher positions as you go along.  Believe me, you're probably looking at a two year stretch in the UK before you can land a job paying above 19k.  Unless you have a medical degree.  Or haven't you heard about the above 300,000 people that leave the UK every year, it's called 'white flight'. 

Any job you see that pays above this you can guarantee there's a temp worker who's been there for the last 12 months doing that same job for peanuts and the job has that persons name on it. It's only advertised because they legally have to, but take it from me, there is no job.

So go to a temp agency and do the same and god help you if your contract is with a company that only ever hires temps, then you're screwed.  If you can think of anything at all that you can do where you currently are, then do that.  You will have the biggest, nastiest, most painful shock of your life when you come back.  I'm not even being overly negative, just telling you the truth.  Don't hope for a miracle of everything just falling into place,because it won't.  You must make realistic plans for a long haul.

Reports in Portugal suggest that Markovic has not yet been given the green light to travel to England.

The hitch is not expected to ultimately prevent the deal going through and the 20-year-old has already been given permission not to continue pre-season training with Benfica.

chelsea: is a oil club meaning they got tons of money, and i can say whitout a doubt the most defensive team in the league, they get results, but by god they are friggen boring to watch, there coach would win the trophy for most anoying coach ever, even if he didnt participate.

man city: are the current league champions, we finished 2 points behind em last season, its a oil club meaning it has tons of money, but despite winning the league and having tons of great players, the team somehow lacks grandness, perhaps its just the lack of history, and the fact that, they have been in man uniteds shadow for sometime.

man u: this club aint worth talking about, basicly they held on to there aging players for to long, and now the team lacks leaders, the captain wants to leave, they finished 7 last year, and frankly its gonna take time for them to rebuild, perhaps in 2 years time.

behind these teams everton, tottenham and last year also southhampton was the runner ups, that is beside man united, since they ended in 7th. southampton lost most of there players, in this window its gonna be tough, everton seems to be keeping there players, and tottenham well they blew shit load of money last year, and basicly got very little out of it, they also switched coach a couple of times, wich says something about the problems they are facing.

I agree that Liverpool's demand for ticket sales will probably never deplete, but the commercial money will. Therefore, matchday revenue is not really the savior. It can be, in concert with a number of other things.

I don't know, I guess I've always been assuming we could at least reach Chelsea's level of consistency in the EPL/CL in a relatively short period of time. But we continually miss out on players because of money despite playing amazing football and having a massive fan base. A guy like Sanchez going to Arsenal is so puzzling for me, but it just happened. Yes, Wenger is a great manager, but he gets fuck all in terms of results in the last 10 years. Yes, their squad is as good as ours on paper, probably better now that we lost Suarez, but they inevitably end up losing players to injury because of their personnel. I can't understand that one except to say that they must have offered him a better wage. I honestly don't think it had anything to do with winning, and I'd say we have just as good a shot at winning anything as Arsenal, pre-Sanchez, does.

Anyway, it's been an interesting discussion. I don't really know what I'm trying to prove, except that I don't think the narrative we have in our head regarding Liverpool's path to success is actually plausible. I don't think there is long-term success to likely occur without getting the players we haven't been able to sign. Suarez, in my opinion, was literally our only in with the world's best. And he's just gone. Yes, maybe we'll have another player become another Suarez, but will they go before we can use them as an anchor for world-class players?

It was nice if you were a protestant in England, perhaps - but how do you square the claim of religious and civil liberty with the Penal laws and the Protestant Ascendency in Ireland? James' defeat undoubtedly made things worse for Irish Catholics for (depending on what you want to count) several decades through a couple of centuries. 

Sure, I can imagine that might not be the official line the order takes when talking about what it's celebrating, but it's incredibly naive to expect the population whose ancestors suffered as a result of sectarian laws passed following that battle to ignore it and clap along with how good a day it was to be Protestant. And this is of course not at all helped by the events surrounding these groups in the intervening years and the fact that some (whether in lodges, bands, or associated hangers-on) *do* treat the celebrations around the 12th as a time to rub ""themmuns'"" nose in it.",0,1405096962,null,0,false,0,cium3vb,t3_2afl2a,t1_cium3vb,t1_ciukj1c,null,1434665735,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6

http://dsa.org.uk/companies/nsa_ir_be_nl_uk_ltd


&gt;NSA, the maker of Juice PLUS+®, is a privately owned company with headquarters in Memphis, US.
Founded in 1970 by its current president Jay Martin, NSA has evolved its person-to-person marketing model into the unique Juice PLUS+® Personal Franchise system of today.
Under Jay's leadership, NSA has grown from a small direct sales company into a highly profitable, multi-million dollar company operating in more than 20 countries.

&gt;NSA (IR.BE.NL.UK) Ltd
Established in 1986, the operational support office for the UK, Ireland, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Spain, is located on the outskirts of Milan at the Centro Direzionale Colleoni, Agrate Brianza.
Shay O'Brien Jnr is the Managing Director &amp; Master Distributor for the 6 markets. He has been with NSA since 1989 becoming one of the most successful Personal Franchisees worldwide. Professionally he can not only count on his great experience and knowledge of the field but also on several years of Company management, which make of him a man of wide perspective and modern mind.

&gt;Today, almost 40 years and more than $7 billion dollars later, NSA remains not only on the leading edge of the ""direct selling"" industry but at the forefront of the health and wellness industry as well. Jay Martin continues to share his lifelong vision for improving people's lives through both the documented health benefits of Juice PLUS+® and the Juice PLUS+® Personal Franchise, a powerful tool for building financial well-being.

&gt;Currently, NSA continues to improve Juice PLUS+® and the whole family of Juice PLUS+® wholefood-based nutritional products, based on 26 different fruit, vegetables and berries of an exclusive quality and manufactured to a high standard. But the single most important factor that separates Juice PLUS+® from other nutritional supplements is the large and growing body of research conducted on the product - 17 independent clinical studies proving its bioavailability and efficecy on the body, have already been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and as many are currently underway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Labelling any criticism as ""senseless moaning"" bothers me. I think I had some valid points. 

Sylla, Luna, Bennett and Bacuna are piss-poor. Do you remember how many goals Bacuna was directly at fault for last season? Lowton was always an extremely poor defender and seems to have a rotten attitude. It has taken Lambert 3 attempts to solve our problem at left-back and he still hasn't done it. It doesn't matter that we paid relatively low amounts for these players, if they can't do a good enough job then they are a liability. I'll give you Vlaar, but I'm yet to see him dominate in a Villa shirt. He did very well for the Netherlands but he must translate that into club form. It will be great to see Vlaar + Okore play together. The less said about Clark/Baker, the better.

It is frankly astonishing that Aleksander Tonev made it to the Premier League. Helenius arrived and sat on his arse for a year. He couldn't even play when Benteke and Kozak broke their legs and is most remembered for having his shorts pulled down by Vertonghen. Now he's gone back to Denmark to get a game. As it stands right now, we spent upwards of £1m on a consolation goal against Sheffield United.

KEA and Westwood, combined, do the job that one good midfielder could do. KEA is a tenacious workhorse with very little skill or quality, and Westwood keeps things ticking over with his 5-yard passes but has no physical presence or defensive quality. Get *one* good midfielder in who can do both of those jobs and, hey presto, we've suddenly got extra room for an attack-minded midfielder. I know I'm simplifying it a lot, but you could see last season our midfield was so lacking in any creativity that we usually bypassed them entirely. The long ball from Guzan to Benteke was our specialty. 

Delph has been a revelation, but to fully credit Lambert for that might be a bit much because part of it was circumstantial. Injuries and inexperience greatly hampered his progress before Lambert arrived. Likewise, how can you credit Lambert for getting Weimann into ""good form"" when he was one of our worst players last season? Gabby, with his pace and strength, always had a couple of explosive games per season mixed in with many poor ones. Nothing changed. He has always been consistently inconsistent.

Lambert made a big song-and-dance about banishing the high-earners to the reserves. They had no place in our team. Bent, Hutton, N'Zogbia, Given and more were spoiled goods and we were better off without them. Well, after letting them rot in the reserves for a year, we've decided we need them back. Bent looks worse than ever, but I suppose we need the reinforcements. It is laughable how it has happened, though. I think it undermines Lambert.

&gt; Things aren't looking good and I'm not happy either but people need to calm down, at least until after the World Cup is done and we are closer to the end of the summer. If he doesn't have a buyer by then Lerner will invest. He doesn't know soccer, but he knows business enough to know we're worth more in the Premiere League.

Then what's the point in signing these free agents who are well past their sell-by dates? If we get a new owner, we will have money to invest in the squad. If Lerner stays, according to you, he will invest in the squad. So why are we snapping up these free players?

What makes you think Lerner will suddenly invest in the last few weeks of the summer if we don't have a buyer? And even if he *does* suddenly pour £20m+ into the budget, and we manage to get some first-team players in, then that means we're stuck with the likes of Senderos, Joe Cole, Bendtner and Kieran Richardson for 2 years.

I know Bendtner and Richardson are only rumoured, but you catch my drift. We're signing all of these guys on 2-year contracts or more and we won't be able to shift them next summer.  I suppose you could make an argument for squad depth.

To me, though, it reeks of confusion at the club. Lambert doesn't know what's going to happen so he's hedging his bets. Another season of struggle seems inevitable.",0,1405097778,null,0,false,0,ciumlcs,t3_2aac3v,t1_ciumlcs,t1_ciu3vaz,null,1434665832,-1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,-1

What I'd personally like to see is efforts made to make the Irish nation inclusive again. Protestants in the south seem to be left to their own devices, but I think the divisions created by British policy in Ireland would be better healed in a UI by actively embracing that the Irish nation has different traditions.

This means I'm on the half rate of money and I do not get exemptions for prescriptions/dentist etc as i'm not technically on income related ESA. At the moment I have to send in GP certificates regularly to confirm that I cannot work and my condition hasn't improved. I've also sent them copies of any relevant medical letters, such as after seeing my specialist, and I also update them whenever something severe happens so they have a record of my A&amp;E visits.

I'm worried about the medical assessment as it is very long and tiring, and I will have to educate the assessor about my condition as it very rare (EDS) and people assume i'm being overly dramatic about my symptoms (I have debilitating chronic pain and dislocate major joints, most recently a shoulder and my neck). The assessors aren't known to be the nicest, my sister's outright said he sees a lot of people faking ME (the reason why she can't work).

She's now doing work related activity stuff, which is going to get her on some (already free and widely available) courses. Once this is done staff will look at jobs with her and she will need to explain why she can't do each one.

true,CaptainPedge,null,null,"At your first meeting at the job centre your advisor will write up a Job Seekers Agreement (JSAG) which lays out a personal plan for what you need to do each week to receive your payment. This will usually be apply for a certain number of jobs per day  but may have other things attached as well.

Depending on your age and qualifications, they may decide that you need to be doing more to actually get a job. They may send you on a computer course or basic numeracy/literacy (but if you have been holding down a job as you say chances are you are already above and beyond what they would be able to offer you).

After 2 years on JSA you will be enrolled onto The Work Programme. This is where it gets a bit shit. At this point your only contact with the job centre will be a fortnightly signing on session (takes about 5-10 minutes if you do't have to wait) however they pass your details on to a private company of their choice (you get zero say in this) and this private company then takes over the task of getting you a job. They can demand you go on meaningless courses, send you to irrelevant seminars, enrol you onto work experience programmes and other such nonsense all with the threat of a sanction (meaning your benefit payment will be cut off. Yes, thats right. A private company put in a bid to the government for the ability to cut people off from their benefits). This work programme lasts for two years. If you are unhappy with the way your work programme provider is treating you, tough. You have no recourse.

After that, you get sent back to the job Centre and put on Post Work Programme support. PWP is 6 monthly meetings with an advisor, on top of your regular fortnightly signing appointments where they will try to continue the types of thing the WP provider were offering. I actually found this slightly more helpful as my advisor seemed to understand my circumstances as a mature student and understood that until I actually graduate with a proper qualification I was kinda stuck with what I had when I left school which was honestly not that impressive.

After those six months are up, that's it. You have a fortnightly appointment to sign on and otherwise left to your own devices.

All in all, its a system to get you off JSA. They really don't care if that means that you get a job or just sign off and stop bothering them.

Also, d'you mean backdating of HB (claiming for a time before you submitted your claim) or backpayment (giving you the money you were eligible for since your claim once they make their decision)?

Edit- Actually, I'm finding it difficult to find any reference HB backdating rules that involve the start of the tax year. Shelter's website says ""Backdated awards can only be made for a limited period, depending on your age, for a maximum of either three or six months."" With no reference to the start of the tax year. 

Edit2- Regardless, on the topic of premiums it shouldn't have to be backdated. As soon as you meet the eligibility for the premiums, they should start paying you. The IS10 form should not even exist. It shouldn't be up to the claimant to show they're eligible. For me, the DWP already had all the information that showed I should be receiving the premiums. And even if it were expected of the claimant to provide the same information again, as rev9of8 says, they don't tell you the premiums exist, the criteria, or how to claim it. And that premium also means for me that I'm treated as an over 35 for LHA. So that's the difference between being given the house share rate, or the one bedroom rate of LHA. It seems like they use the IS10 to treat the premiums as a separate claim which can now be subject to limited backdating period rules.

Starting at the lowest-class end -- Aldi and Lidl (discount chains) used to be sneered at but I think now many people have realised cheap doesn't necessarily mean chavvy in their case.

Iceland is pretty trashy, they have (had?) a long association with Kerry Katona as their brand celebrity which kinda says it all if you're into that sneery class judgementalism.

Asda is pretty working class I would say, not really considered trashy like Walmart tho.

Tesco brand I see as in that kinda top end of working class, lower-to-middle middle class area, sort of 'aspirational' to be middle or upper middle class but not really at that level in reality.

Sainsbury's is pretty bang middle middle class I guess.

Waitrose and M&amp;S are at the more 'posh' end of the spectrum (although we're still talking upper middle class more than bona fide upper class, as the bona fide upper classes surely don't shop in a _supermarket_, darling.)

I don't really know where to put Morrisons.

Note that this isn't even about who shops there really, it's not like I'm saying these shops are solely patronised by people of those narrow little bands, most people simply shop wherever is geographically convenient tbh -- it's just the subliminal associations of their brand placement I'm talking about here.

In the meantime Murray wanted to sell his share in Rangers, couldn't find a legit buyer and settled for escape with Whyte's offer.

The reason that people have a go at Murray is for handing the club over to a shyster without any real checks on the guy. That shyster then bankrupted the club through wilful non payment of tax, which is another matter altogether from having a tax dispute. 

Did HMRC bankrupt rangers? No of course not, they didn't win the tax case. Did Murray bankrupt Rangers? No he wasn't there at the time, and as is now proven he didn't leave a huge tax bill behind.

 [**Peep o' Day Boys**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peep%20o'%20Day%20Boys): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Peep o' Day Boys__ was an agrarian [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant) association in [18th century Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_1691-1801). Originally noted as being an agrarian society around 1779–80, from 1785 it became the Protestant component of the sectarian conflict that emerged in [County Armagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Armagh), their rivals being the Catholic [Defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(Ireland\)).   After the [Battle of the Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Diamond) in 1795, where an off-shoot of the Peep o' Day Boys known as the Orange Boys defeated a force of Defenders, the [Orange Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Order) was instituted, and whilst repudiating the activities of the Peep o' Day Boys, they quickly superseded them.   The Orange Order would blame the Peep o' Day Boys for ""the Armagh outrages"" that followed the battle.

 It looks like Arsenal have a lot of cash right now and are willing to spend it and im pretty sure they can afford better wages than us.

2) Manchester United. For obvious reasons.

3) Real Madrid. They absolutely stink of corruption - check out the sale of their old training to the Madrid council despite the fact they were gifted it decades earlier. I dislike a lot of their players, and similar to the view of another poster in the thread here regarding Man U, they take the view that they are a gift to football due to their heritage and image.

4) Spurs. Their club irritates me in general and their fans have been real shitheads over the years, for similar reasons to Chelsea's.

true,cokeandhoes,null,null,"&gt; but Question Time is a shameless travesty of a programme

I've heard this a few times, but you can't help it that politicians now are so refined and all follow the American school of politics. It's not Dimbleby's fault that politicians are experts at saying nothing. 

Their mouthful parlance such as 'at the end of the day' and 'the fact of the matter is' have even intruded everyday vernacular. You can ask any question, but if they're all going to start by first offering their sympathies to the victims for a whole ten minutes and then answer the actual question by whatever has polled best, then it's not a problem with the show, but political debate in general.

I guess Dimbleby could cut off everyone and say, ""Yes, we all know you feel for the victims but what about..."" But, I think the press would jump on him for being insensitive.

Still, when local issue arise and the audience push their local representative as guests on it, that's when you get real debates on that show.

Edit: There's always a woman in the audience who brings up a very localized concern and I love watching the guests wondering why she's bothering them with 'petty' issues.

true,machoki,null,null,"Yo guys. I watch Hungarian league every week and saw a lot of him, I can give you some information about him:

He is verstile, he can play CB as well. I heard he played CB at Hamburg (5 games in the senior team) before coming to Hungary 2 years ago. He played RB a couple of games, but it was out of necessity.

A little bit about him then. He got kicked out by Hamburg because he had an argument with the coach. And he didn't play for the u21 national team for the same reason. Here in Hungary none of these happened, he had two different coaches and both like him. I doubt he has any of those issues any more he matured a lot here.

He plays for Ferencváros, which is the biggest, most supported clubs, and it's really hard for their supporters to accept and like any player, but he succeeded. I have to say here a little bit about the level of Hungarian league: We haven't sold any Hungarian player to the top 5 leagues in 5 years (maybe foregners neither). So far in Europa league qualifying 2 teams played against to teams in Malta with the score of 1-1 and 2-1. The 1-1 game was away and played by Ferencváros. Of course the league is better than the Maltese league, but the teams are of the level of low championship and league 1. Ferencváros now has Thomas Doll as a coach, who maneged in Bundesliga, and before that Ricardo Moniz, now at 1860 Münich.

Besic: Positives: Was the best player of the league this year, and last year. Never stops running, if I remember correctly in 2 games this WC he ran the most. Very good technique, he'll only give the ball away in the very last resort, he'll do anything to pass/dribble the ball even in tight situations, with very good success rate. Amazing tackling, and likes to hastle opponents very much. He plays a bit like Sissoko + the technique. He's fast, his acceleration is above average. Shows leadership as well.

Negatives: Bad shots, not very good with long balls, and his heading isn't outstadning (not really bad though).

I predicted that he would sign for a low, maximum middle level PL club, so if he really goes to Swansea it's a big step for him. His work rate and and always wanting to get better help him to succeed nevertheless. I wouldn't be suprised if he had a couple of bad games, but with playing time and confidence of the coach he can do what Swansea fans would excpect in a few weeks, months in the PL. In my opinion it's more likely that he succeeds than doesn't, about 80%-20%.

If you have any questions just throw them on me, don't really know what to say.

PS: Several lists about players with the biggest potential had him in it when he was 18-19.

PS2: Martinez really praised him during the world cup in the commentator box, so that means a lot. Ferencváros will only get 30% of the transfer fee, because that's how Hamburg let him join them for free, so the transfer could be complicated.

They use the following in the title:

&gt;Girl gang who kicked woman in the head while yelling 'kill the white slag' freed after judge hears 'they weren't used to drinking because they're Muslims'

Which is factually correct, but clearly a complete spin on the trial. They've purposely made it sound like they were freed *because* they weren't used to drinking alcohol. That's not the case at all. Their Lawyer could have said 'Your honour, Walla walla bibo balla ding dong' and the title could have read:

&gt;Girl gang who kicked woman in the head while yelling 'kill the white slag' freed after judge hears 'Walla walla bibo balla ding dong'

The real reason for why the Judge was lenient with them is at the bottom of the page:

&gt;Judge Brown said that ‘those who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside’.


&gt;But he said he accepted the women may have felt they were the victims of unreasonable force from Mr Moore as he tried to defend his girlfriend, and handed the defendants a suspended sentence.


So the Daily Mail framed it as a judge letting a muslim off because they weren't used to alcohol when really he reduced their sentences because the victims partner beat the shit out of them. 

Disgusting vile newspaper. 

And in case you think that no one could possibly read the article that way, the top comments are:

&gt;NO EXCUSE!!! If these women were white they would have been jailed

And 

&gt;Don't know how they were able to convince the Judge that they were Muslims when they were in clear violation of the religion by being drunk anyways. Disgusting behaviour ... if they don't like 'white slags' they can always go back to their country of origin.

So, say your card has a £2000 limit, you've already used £1300 of that credit. You want to take the last £700, pay it back immediately so that you're back to £1300, except this time you'll only be paying interest on £600?

Yes it'll be a little different but as a whole, the team is still pretty top notch(with some small areas for improvements).

I have this feeling that you didn't grow up in the 80s when what you see on Doctor Who from that era is literally what every sitcom on TV was pretty much. A lot of shows were ""filmed in front of a studio audience"" (Doctor Who is not one of these) so they were pretty much actors on a set. Modern technology and the advent of computers rapidly increased the quality of TV shows. Cameras, mics, everything basically became a lot better and more portable, editing techniques became better, broadcast technologies improved, everything changed. If you watch anything from the 80s or before (eg Red Dwarf) you'll notice it looks exactly like Doctor Who from the same era, you can't really expect things that are that old to compare to todays stuff. I get a really heavy nostalgia trip when I watch the classics, I remember when TV was like that as a kid and it takes me back, so while I get where you're coming from about the classics, I can't agree that they should be remastered or anything, the nostalgia is a huge part of it for a lot of folks.",0,1405105215,null,0,false,0,ciuqx59,t3_2af9yt,t1_ciuqx59,t1_ciun6k5,null,1434668082,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Why is being able to track Metadata a 'bad thing'? 

The ISPs hold the metadata, a court order is issued to access the metadata, this is then used in the investigations as required.

it is not as if they are holding the entire contents of what was text and when, simply the when, this allows Geo-locational evidence to be collected

&gt;Suspect A says they were not at Location A, however Metadata shows there Mobile was used to send a text message to Suspect B at Location A at the time they claim they were not there.

i got some advice from the CAB and was told to complain everytime a mistake was made or a rule was broken (you wont believe how many times they break rules) and to appeal the decision when they stopped payments over no sick note being received (i had one to cover 12 months).

when i started to take the advice all payments where made until a decision was made on the appeal (in not sure if they still do this, its was 2010-2011). It took three months, no effort on my part but i was sent all of the paperwork to read and kept updated. 
i won (they 'found' the sick note and admired fault) and was given all of the money they hadn't payed me and £1,000 compensation.

##Club &amp; Manager  

Wanted to come to PL, had good feeling about Southampton after he came here to meet with Les Reed. Likes PL a lot, best league in the world etc.  

Is a manager who likes to see his team play football, likes to play attractive football to watch at the club, he likes to bring through youth and we have a great academy, and he has great experience bringing through players etc.  

Is a communicator, every person in the club is important and necessary to bring Southampton forward, and he looks forward to that.  (Nice for the fans to have him tweeting etc, see how things are going).  

Players and staff have been great, fantastic and organised, look like a real family which he really likes (mentions good atmosphere once or twice in interview).  

(When asked about club's ambition and going forward:) Spoke to experience players, like Jose Fonte &amp; Steven Davis because they have to keep the ambition in the dressing room, and they’re happy to be players of Southampton. He promised them, and he promises the fans that at the start of the season we will have a very good team.  

Looking forward to the friendlies, especially Leverkusen. Good because opinions based on training sessions are one thing, but in matches is another. Nice for fans and local teams to have the local friendlies.  
Looking forward to being at St Marys with the fans.  

##Team / Transfers / Rebuilding  

Was told in his first meeting with Reed that Lambert/Shaw/Lallana were already going, but after those we are ""not a selling club""... Does point out (quite rightly) that there's always a lot of player movement in football.  
Will continue with philosophy of team, continue bringing through young players, continue on from last season's success, and still have ambition to go forward.  

Big challenge to rebuild, especially after great season, but they are used to rebuilding every season with young players in Holland.  

Lovren to report back on Sunday (following holiday due to World Cup). Has spoken to Lovren, who made his feelings clear, but Koeman and Reed both want to keep him here (reiterated the old cliche of still on contract), but don't know what will happen come Sunday. Not happy that Lovren went to the press about it.  
Wants players happy to play to Southampton, will talk to ""players"" (Lovren) and if there is a difference in opinion (if Lovren isn't happy playing for Saints) then it will spoke about and a final decision will be made with the board if nothing can be done. ""expects Lovren to be here at start of season"" - but doesn't know.  

No bids for Schneiderlin yet, no intention of selling.  

Southampton will get some players in, Pelle deal is still on, and Koeman thinks maybe by this weekend. ""It’s close but it's still not signed"", ""we hope maybe this weekend to have him as second new player of Southampton"".  
Can smell (sense?) what happened in the club previously, in the dressing room previously.  

Need some more players to bring competition with the rest of the team players. Impressed with the quality of players Saints are looking at, with a great scouting system, every day they talk about new players, young players, U21. It’s only been 10 days though, and wants more time to gain a better opinion on the squad.  

Osvaldo was meant to be back, didn’t turn up, ""medical reasons"", but has a contract and should be back. Wants to have a good atmosphere in the team (he doesn't specifically state that Osvaldo may ruin that), hasn’t spoken to Osvaldo. He will have to come back and do training on his own because he’s late. Talks will occur with player, manager and board. But not happy with the way he brings things to the press either and there will be talks about that too.  

J-rod progressing very well, working very hard, impressed by how hard he’s working but needs more time to recouperate. Notes his strong character to have to keep doing fitness stuff while everyone else goes off to train.
  

##Youth

Impresed after 10 days with first team, impressed by training facilities, impressed by how the boys are training.   

He's impressed with the youth here, impressed with their training, and (though interrupted elsewhere in the interview: is impressed with the training facilities etc).  

Lallana is a great player in his position, and Tadic is a great player in his position too, with similar qualities that he knows very well from Eredevisie.  

Lot of potential in our squad, don’t need 3 months for that, just need 3 or 4 days, great talents and great potential. Young players will have opportunity to play in the first team.  


##Miscellaneous (**my opinion on some retarded press**)

Press are also fucking annoying (my opinion), keep asking him about Suarez &amp; Barca (once eary then AGAIN at the end, ffs), United &amp; Van Gaal (for about 2 minutes or more), in his first Southampton interview, also interrupt him when he was about to say his feelings about the club (misunderstood a question, but was about to say nice things about us, i.e. impressed the training grounds before they cut him off to ask another Lovren related question).

NI was a bigoted cesspit in 1922, and its a bigoted cesspit in 2014. If this state still exists in another 80 years it'll still have 'Peace' walls, a militarised police, paramilitaries, and a parliament that institutionalises sectarianism. 

If we want to see real political progress we need to get rid of the border. 'Our wee Country' is not sustainable economically or socially. The border casts a shadow over just about every political topic in NI.

So we can keep trying to make Stormont work, or we can try Stormont mk2, mk3, mk4 etc etc, each time we will hit the same brick wall. We are trying to force to parties from across a sectarian divide to govern a state that was invented solely on sectarian lines.


Edit: One other thing I forgot to add, having our sectarian divide *roughly* follow the typical left/right divide, coupled with the necessity for cross-community support for any actions taken by Stormont, guarantees political stagnation.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"So as I see a lot of comments addressing why Spurs are going to be better, let me take the other road; why Sanchez &amp; Debuchy don't count for a damn thing at Arsenal.

Sanchez doesn't give them anything they don't already have in Walcott, Ox, and Serge Gnabry. He's 25, 5'7, and they paid 3 Christian Eriksens for him. Yay. Is he going to play as a striker? great, either a 5'7 guy is leading your line, or Arsenal are vastly changing what they do to fit him in. He's playing on the wing you say? Too bad he can't cross to save his life. He's really only ""world-class"" when he has chances to run at people in space... which he won't get often at Arsenal, because everyone in the lower half of the table parks the bus against them and just says ""play in front of us"".

Debuchy is their 7th defender; he was *fine* at Newcastle last year, but he's not exactly God's gift to full-backs, and Arsenal just paid 1 Christian Eriksen for him. Oh, and at 5'10, he can't do the one thing Sagna could which was key for Arsenal last year; fill in at CB. See, Arsenal only have 3 CBs; 1 of which is secretly a statue that has to be wheeled around the pitch (Mertesacker) and 1 of knows the training staff better than the coaching staff (Vermaelen). Moreover, all 3 of their CBs went to the world cup, and Vermaelen went and got himself injured. Again. They lose one of those guys, or Vermaelen doesn't come back from injury, and boom, they're playing the same CB pairing twice a week through the whole fall - having both your CBs staring down 30 appearances before Christmas is a recipe for a 2nd half breakdown... which happens to be Arsenal's MO.

Moreover, they still only have ONE holding midfielder (Flamini) and ONE striker (Giroud) who have the talent to play in the Premier League; anything happens to either of them, and Arsenal are up a creek. Don't  get me wrong, Sanchez &amp; Ozil (and Debuchy) are big signings, but it would be like us signing another Goaltender or two; we're already set there, we don't need them there. Same with Arsenal and full-backs/ attacking players; They now have Rosicky, Cazorla, Wilshere, Walcott, Sanchez, Gnabry, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Podolski who can play in that attacking 3; that's 9 players for 3 spots; they are **3 deep** along their attacking front, and not even *2 deep* at Center back.

&gt; That said, I firmly believe that bankers/big energy/big business have a fairly strong hold on the world, they manipulate systems, artificially fix rates, hold monopolies on commerce and bully smaller companies out of existence, etc etc.

It's like I always say to conspiracy theorists. Why would the bankers, politicians, royal families, CEOs, heads of state, oligarchs, civil servants and so on need a secret conspiracy to run the world? They already run the world openly! You don't need to make things more complex than they actually are; of course, when you scrape away the surface, you'll find that an incredible number of conspiracy theories are actually just elaborate methods of proving that the Jews (or some other group, Arabs are starting to slowly gain in popularity) are responsible for everything bad in the world. What's disturbing is when people spout these conspiracy theories without even realising what they imply. When I hear someone say 'Rothschild' I do a 180.

The biggest problem with conspiracy theories though, in my opinion, is that they sap people's political energy. What could you actually do to counter a totally monolithic global conspiracy? The answer is absolutely nothing; not as an individual, not as a community, probably not even as a nation in most cases. You can't vote because they control all the candidates, you can't do grassroots or direct action because they'll hunt you down, you can't even have a revolution, because they'll win.

find a niche that you like. For me it's IT (and a subsector in IT specifically) It'll help you later on when you have advanced as specialists are hard to come by and get paid accordingly.

Try to be honest to yourself: If you don't like it, try find something else. It's a miserable job to do if you hate it as it's tied in with hitting targets.
I find the above really depends on the company for me. I like where I work, what I do and the people I work with, so I do well. If it was a shitty climate, I'd suck and would be miserable.

If anything, any job is a numbers game. if it doesn't work out the first few times with applications, keep trying. You can only get a job you applied for.

1) the Govt will not be responsible for the Metadata, your ISP will

2) The Metadata (and only the data requested) can only be obtained via a Court Order (just as it is now)

It's because we have over the years devised a system that really does not allow for much dissent. If party line says ""you will vote this way"", it seems very rare for an MP to vote against it.

Quite frankly, I'm a grown adult who works for a living. No MP has a right to tell me what to think; if anything it should be the other way around. But it doesn't seem to work that way.

Peace has been exchanged for land, but abandoning territory to Hezbollah and Hamas has unquestioningly failed. Attempts at negotiation have been almost entirely fruitless despite the Israelis being willing to make massive compromises due to the weakness of the Palestinian leadership.

A fine can only be issued by a court, but when issuing the fine the court must place a default sentence alongside that in the case of non-payment (a custodial sentence). As the sentences handed down in this instance are not custodial, it is clear that they are not being sentenced for defaulting on a court-issued fine.

It's surprisingly hard to actually work out the legal status of the ""fine"" imposed by the local council, but as it was by the statement of the council's representative issued by them and not a court, it can't be considered a fine in the strictest legal sense.

Therefore, since we're not looking at sentencing due to a legally-defined default, but instead on monies owed under law as a debt to a public institution, it would *not* be criminally enforced, but civil.

Following this logic it must be assumed that they are being given the sentence for the act itself - the act suggests that in effect you have broken the law by doing this regardless, but the council won't press charges if you buy them off.",0,1405111462,null,0,false,0,ciuuclv,t3_2afgz2,t1_ciuuclv,t1_ciuitil,null,1434669643,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

&gt;The lack of NHS beds has been a problem for a long time. I distinctly remember the Conservatives ripping into Labour for it under the last government (not that they have done much to improve the situation).

Exactly. And from the second link: 'The number of patients travelling to seek emergency treatment has more than doubled in two years - from 1,301 people in 2011-12 to 3,024 in 2013-14.' 

This just shows they've made the problem that they were blaming labour for *worse*.

Yes, of course cuts were necessary, but when they are first of all cutting healthcare at all which is something that is obviously so necessary for a society to function properly it seems ridiculous.

As I said before, it seems likely to me that it is easier for governments to just treat it as a vanity project valuable to a large proportion of the electorate who hold significant political capital to the point it is not worth opposing it.

The difference between Israel and Nazi Germany is clear and obvious, the Israelis are not creating camps to industrialise the murder of Palestinians en masse, they have a strong perceived cultural and religious link to the land that is overriding strategic concerns, they have enough territory already for the population that they hold. Furthermore, the Israelis are more civically nationalist than ethnically nationalist, they accepted Jews from Africa to Russia, the Middle East to America. They also accept Arab Palestinians within their borders as citizens.

No one who is not entirely ignorant, or anti-semetic (of both) would make allegories between the two situations. Yet such comparisons are legion in the anti-Israel press and amongst people who do not know what they are talking about. They tend to take people trying to mould isolated words and situations which do not reflect the present day situation into attacks on Israel to try and delegitimise them.

The situation is simple: they are annexing territory which they have an element of administrative control over and a perceived historical tie to. They might be doing so due to cultural reasons and not economic or strategic, but that is what they are doing. This is different from claiming any and all territory from people you identify as being ethnically inferior to you and disregarding all claims they have.

You are probably not anti-Semitic; but a lot of people out there are. It makes sense therefore to avoid anything that makes them feel like their hatred is legitimate.",1,1405115926,null,0,false,0,ciuwoam,t3_2afk4e,t1_ciuwoam,t1_ciuwa2e,null,1435473733,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

By no means would I say we are a selling club. But on the other hand, taking our level as a club, we never bought our way to success either.

Barcelona can wave their ""mes que un club"" flag all day long but truth is, they have been buying their way to success for the best part of the last 20 years I have been actively following football. Starting way back to (the original) Ronaldo till neymar and Suarez. Their academy is brilliant, don't get me wrong, but they have always been mixing it up with marquee signings. And kudos to them, is strategy has paid its dividends. Although they are massively in debt -to the Spanish government mind you- and their dealings are sometimes controversial -wink wink neymar-. In all honesty, this is the concept for many clubs. 

Not for us, though. We don't do that. 

Now, don't get me wrong. We do have our spending sprees. We -most definitely-tend to overpay for players. Not on that level, though. We tend to take raw talent, embrace it, nurture it, and transform it into world class. 

We truly are a special club. For all the tribal nature of football, I truly believe that the power of our fans, history, stadium, mentality is truly something unique, extraordinary. Players have left this club for the right and the wrong reasons. Not one of them, however, has lost his touch with the club. Owen wishes he never left, Luis Garcia has become more of a fan than an ex player, Alonso follows our games while in practice with real, mascherano dedicates a European cup to us, Torres reminisces his time with us. 


We do things our way. We are a truly special club. And such a club deserves only a handful of legends. A few players that realised what is truly important and sticked with us though thick and thin.

I've lived through the departures of mcmanaman all the way to today. We've always come back stronger and trust me, we will again.

Tl;dr;
We're special. Forget Suarez :) ",0,1405116544,null,0,false,0,ciuwzdt,t3_2afc86,t1_ciuwzdt,t3_2afc86,null,1434670877,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
true,jakegrubbs19,lfc99,,"Thanks for only sprinkling in the condescending tone. However, I digress. Suarez can really play anywhere along the attacking line. He can play either wing and use his pace and abilities to not only beat defenders, but to draw defenders from out of the box. He can play in a lead the line type position where he is the focal point of the attack. From this position he can take on 2, 3, 4 defenders. And he probably will. And most of the time he may lose possession. He can play in the hole behind the striker as the creative outlet. With the ball at his feet, he requires attention not only from the man guarding him, but the rest of the defense because he can pick a pass brilliantly and he can score from just about anywhere within the attacking half. 

That being said, he has his flaws. For Suarez to be Suarez, he needs the ball. He needs the ball to get into the flow and rhythm of the match. If he goes too long without the ball, he can get angry. Especially with teammates when he feels as though he could have done better with the ball. And you will be able to tell instantly when this is occurring. He will yell and scream when it is not played to him and when he does receive the ball, he will try one too many things and end up losing possession. 

At Liverpool, this isn't that serious of an issue because EVERYONE knew that Suarez was our creative outlet and there were rarely issues of him not being played the ball. But when his tantrums started up with his yelling at his teammates, it could be overlooked when he curls in a beauty from a set piece. 

This is the biggest issue I feel Suarez will have at Barcelona. I do not think he will enjoy playing second, or even third, fiddle to anyone. And when he starts getting frustrated, his emotions get the best of him (Has bitten three people, has been charged with racial abuse, and flipped off the Fulham fans).

&gt; You call unionist politicians bigots?

Some are, some are not. It's pretty difficult to tell how a politician actually feels. Some may be pretending to be a bigot for votes. Some may be pretending to be a non-bigoted for votes.

&gt; I look at Gerry Sinn Fein who although appear to be the ""nice guys"" by voting for gay marriage etc. actually are trying to wipe every ounce of Britishness out of Northern Ireland.

I don't think he is trying to wipe the britishness out at all. He just wants a United Ireland and is being ruthless about it. I still don't feel at all comfortable with him as a major figure in government.

&gt; You call unionists out on contentious parades?

I don't know why the routes they travel matter. You can hold memorial marches anywhere. Having to walk down *INSERT STREET* because it's tradition seems stupid and arbitrary to me. I'd rather all parades are kept as far away from main traffic flow as possible irrelevent of who is marching. I see celebrating the deaths of hundreds of people from both communities as destructive and cheering for the battles that got them kill as distasteful. To each his own I guess.

I vaguely remember seeing a reporter asking unionist politicians if they had proof (beyond doubt) that creating a united Ireland would give their constituents a better future, would they become republicans? The unionists said they would not. The reporter then asked republican politicians if they had proof (beyond doubt) that staying in the UK would give their constituents a better future, would they become unionists?

Speaking from personal experience (although I doubt my experiences weren't the norm as I've seen WCA guides address these issues), the assessors ask questions which aren't related to the (often innacurate) information they extrapolate from answers. So unless you know what square hole they're trying to fit your round answers into, they can make you out to be absolutely fine. 

And they also use closed questions. So you might have information relevent to a descriptor but if you don't know the details of the descriptor, then you'll just answer yes/no and from that the assessor can again... make shit up. 

Or they just might not ask you a question that's very relevent. All the circumstances whereby a claimant is automatically treated as having limited capability for work or limited capability for work related activity aren't even mentioned on the ESA50 and nor was I ever asked about them during the WCAs. Despite one applying to me. 

There's also the very narrow definition of illnesses they use. Where if you don't fit their selectively chosen symptoms, you're fine. 

And also my assessor wrote in my ESA85 'Chouxinabox claims to have x disorder', then she detailed how I have the classic symptoms of said disorder. But concluded I don't have that disorder. What criteria they use to assess the existence of x disorder, I still don't actually know.

(also, I have examples of these, but felt like it was too Chouxinabox-centric to go on about how assessors specifically used these tactics in my WCAs, so I'm sorry if they're too general to understand)

So yeah, unless you know exactly how to 'correctly' phrase your issues, you're fucked.

In my eyes it's simple: a winger is a player who plays on the left or the right and tracks back, players who do not track back often are forwards.

Have you ever heard Sterling referred to as a forward? The media in the UK ALWAYS refer to him as a winger, I'm not sure where you're from so maybe this is a cultural thing.

I'm not sure if Sterling played the majority of his minutes in the center, can probably look at a few heatmaps and see but when I did that a few months ago I remember seeing that he played the majority of the season on the right.

true,fogard14,null,null,"Calling a player piss poor doesn't mean they are.  We disagree on that and it is hard to accurately make an argument about that over the internet.  Stats would favor my argument when it comes to Bacuna and Lowton playing well.  I think Luna and Bennet still have potential but are liabilities when starting at this point, so I think we most definitely need a left back. 

I most certainly wouldn't give Lambert all the credit for Weimann or Delph however I'd give him quite a bit of credit for one reason.  He played them when most people wouldn't have.  Andi had a poor season this past year but a great season is first year under Lambert.  There is absolutely no doubt Gabby has played much better under Lambert than in recent memory.  When it comes to Vlaar the statistics are clear.  He is the difference in our defense and has most certainly dominated some games in a Villa shirt.  I also think Westwood has been one of Lambert's best signings (especially for the price) and could prove to be huge for us in the next couple years if we find someone to complement him and Delph.

He tried to banish the players and it didn't work.  Nobody wants them. Might as well try to use them.

We are snapping up free players on low wages in order to have some depth which we have been sorely lacking in recent years.  If I were a coach last year would have scared me into finding some squad players in case of injuries. Best case scenario they play well and contribute to the team.  Worst case scenario they provide some competition, experience, and peace of mind without costing much at all.

I don't disagree that a lot of this reeks of confusion at the club.  However we don't know whats going on.  We can't assume.  It doesn't pay to piss and moan a month before the season even starts.  Give it some time and try not to think about it.  I understand your frustration.  I share a lot of it.  However I still maintain I don't want r/avfc to become like other Villa fan sites.

I feel we need another AM, another 2 left wingers (or 1 good one, and one who can act as a utility man in attacking midfield) another defensive mid (highly doubtful we get Rodwell) at least and another CB.

On top of that we need a goalscorer desperately,  because we won't get top 8 without one.

For me- realistic targets could be:

CB: Manga would be great as a long term replacement for Distin, but I feel he is a bit pricey from what I have seen. I would be happy with a solid youngster here, as Distin, Jags and Stones have enough about them for the league (however them staying fit is a huge risk), and Kenny might even get a shout in Europe/ Cup games, as he looks like a pure Martinez player... Young as fuck though so he might want to keep him out of the limelight. 

A free transfer, or a cheapy older player would be fine if we backed up the business with a nod to the future.

DM - Besic and Guilavogui (or someone with real physical presence, which we will need in Europe if we are playing more youth players) would be good.

Attacking Midfield areas: Adama Traore (loan) as a Europe and impact player looks to be coming, which is great... But in terms of buying... I think.. we... brace yourself... we should buy Moses. He is young, he performed amazingly under Martinez in the past, and he is hugely out of favor at Chelsea, so we should be able to get him cheap. He was vilified at Liverpool, but fuck them- he didn't fit their system, but he would fit ours. Someone like Kalou would be good also, he could be a real player for us... But I don't know about his attitude, he would compliment Coleman so well on the right, freeing Kev up to move into the middle or on the left. 

Strikers: Ba I don't hate, but don't know if he is worth the wage, I don't think Hope is anywhere near good enough.. But would be happy to be proven wrong.

Unemployed people are defined as those aged 16 and over who are without work, available to start work in the next two weeks and who have either:
a) been actively seeking work in the past four weeks, or
b) are waiting to start a new job they have already obtained.[3]
Those who are without work who do not meet the criteria of unemployment are classed as “out of the labour force”, otherwise known as “economically inactive”.

6.6% unemployment means 2.16mil 'unemployed persons' divided by 32.7mil 'economically active'. There's still 8.8mil economically inactive people between the ages of 16-64.

Cutting people off is one, rather crude, way of decreasing unemployment.

My reasons against reunification would be more practical than ideological though. The North is an economic and political basket case that I don't think the republic could handle, even in good times. The entire state would have to change radically to absorb the North's economy, as well as to accommodate and integrate a new and substantial unionist minority without violence. It just doesn't seem worth it to me. As selfish as this sounds, I'm quite grateful Northern Ireland is largely the UK's problem and not ours.

I'd prefer it NI stayed in the UK more or less as is, but with both the UK and Ireland together pursuing tighter European integration so that borders in general aren't that big a deal anymore. We are living in more of a post-nationalist world as each day goes by, so the whole NI question just feels more and more redundant to me.

That idea is probably a bit too ambitious though - the thought of the UK taking a pro-active role in the EU is probably a bigger pipe dream than a unified Ireland. So I don't know...

I feel that without one of those two players on the attack, we start to lack ideas in how to break down a defensively solid team.  If a breakthrough happens without either of them playing, it seems to be either a set piece, throwing in a bunch of crosses and hoping, or taking potshots from distance.  With Osman or Pienaar, there's intricacy of play, clever one-twos, smart runs, the play needed to break down a solid side.  I'm particularly reminded of the draw at Stoke last season where Osman came on and won a penalty in the 90th minute.  Throughout that whole game, Mirallas was the only one who came close to scoring, and that was twice from outside the box.

And with the world being as turbulent as it is lately who knows what way things would go in that respect. If unification did happen and we had to accommodate the north it wouldn't happen over night. We'd do it sensibly and at a pace that makes sense given the conditions. 

As for rowdy unionists, if unification has happened there would obviously be less of them than there is today. I'd say the moderates would integrate much like the unionists of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal did. Whereas the Loyalists would possibly stir up trouble but they showed in the troubles that they couldn't match the organisation of the republicans and couldn't do much more than shootings without collusion with security forces. I'd say they wouldn't be capable of restarting the troubles. 

On top of that if a post unification government was on the ball they'd make sure loyalist areas were given jobs and facilities and generally make their lives better so that they don't resort to violence. Give them a stake in society and they won't cause as much trouble.

The way I see it, if reunification has come to a vote then the economic and political conditions are suitable for it anyway. I can't see it happening in the first place otherwise.

You're making a largely irrelevant point re the identity of the club. You've taken the scope out much further than what I'm commenting on, and taking my point out of context.

I agree with you in respect of our wider identity. But what I'm referring to is merely our identity from a football perspective. The kit. What is intrinsically Manchester City? Shouldn't we have a kit in which any football fan would instinctively recognise as MCFC colours?

And we do, I believe.

That's why I particularly dislike the constant mish mash of of club colours in recent seasons.

Call me fussy, but it irks me a bit.

I do think there is an importance to the colours we wear, and I know that I'm not alone in this sentiment. Some blues care a lot, some are relatively ambivalent, some are indifferent.

I suppose it's also a part of me wanting to retain what I recognise as Manchester City during an unprecedented period of change at the club. There's always the horrid example of Cardiff, although that remains an extreme example of course.

I'd just like to see our club colours respected a bit more by kit manufacturers, as it is part of what makes Manchester City, Manchester City, however trivial you might wish to make it. We can argue about the importance of this, but we shouldn't overlook the fact that most other domestic and European clubs have set colours, and kit manufacturers don't mess with them the way they do with ours.
