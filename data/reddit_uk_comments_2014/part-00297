I've read the Olympics had a negative effect due to it pulling funding from boring things like local pitches etc. This combined with the selling of of school playing fields does not bode well for public health.

I would argue that direct investment in improved sports facilities, cycle and jogging paths and cheap access along with greater emphasis on promoting health and sport for all would have a beneficial result rather than pissing money on the Olympic committee and McDonald's etc. through tax breaks.

&gt; In 2010, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport outlined the UK Government's plans for this legacy, and included ‘harnessing the UK's passion for sport to increase grass roots participation, particularly by young people—and to encourage the whole population to be more physically active’.3 However, since the games were awarded to London in 2005, there has been an overall decline among 16-year-olds to 25-year-olds in sport participation. 
&gt; 
&gt; These findings are a cause for concern especially as a recent analysis of the burden of disease and life expectancy showed that physical inactivity has a major negative health effect worldwide linked to coronary heart disease, diabetes and cancer.

My morning, and now afternoon, is a bit shit and here's for why: I asked my manager last week if I could have the 11th off and perhaps work a different shift in the week and Mondays are supposed to be the days he comes to the store I'm training in and we have meetings but he didn't come. He came Sunday but he usually shows up both days, trouble is I had a day off Sunday. And he's forgetful so I dunno if I can just go ""well you said I could have the day off"" and not come in or what. I have his number but he'll be busy with another group if trainees at another store, and it feels like he couldn't be arsed to come in yesterday because I'm the only trainee on shift that day.

I've also lost my Wednesday day off which winds me up because I was actually planning on going to see a mate at Uni as that's their free day too. Now I have Sunday and Tuesday off. I don't need or want a break after 1 days work!

&gt;Stop jailing addicts for possession of drugs including Class A substances like heroin and cocaine, says Nick Clegg
&gt;Lib Dem leader says it is 'utterly senseless' to impose custodial sentences
&gt;He argues people need to be treated not 'chucked' behind bars
&gt;Plan is Lib Dem policy and  has not been agreed with the Conservatives
&gt;Heroin junkies to be given foil on the State to encourage users to not inject

Drug addicts caught with Class A substances like heroin and cocaine should not be 'chucked' in jail, Nick Clegg has claimed.
The Deputy Prime Minister said it was 'utterly senseless' that people who needed treatment were instead thrown behind bars when found with small amounts of drugs for personal use.
But the Home Office insisted the courts need to have the power to imprison serious offenders who cause 'the most harm in our communities'.

Mr Clegg has repeatedly put himself at odds with the official government position on drugs.
He has called for a Royal Commission to examine all drug laws, something David Cameron rejects.
Now Mr Clegg has vowed that at the next election the Lib Dems will promise to abolish prison sentences for drug possession.


Mr Clegg said: 'Drugs do untold harm to individuals and to communities. We need a radically smarter approach if we are serious about tackling this problem.

'Liberal Democrats believe the first step is to recognise that drug use is primarily a health problem. Addicts need treatment, not locking up. It is a nonsense to waste scarce resources on prison cells for cannabis users.
'Simply chucking people into prison and turning a blind eye is the lazy option because all it ends up doing is making the problem worse.

'I've always believed that if you're anti-drugs you should be pro-reform. That's why we will ensure nobody will go to prison where their only offence is possession of drugs for their own personal use.
'Instead these people should receive non-custodial sentences and addicts should get the treatment they need to stop using drugs.

'These reforms will ensure that drug users get the help they need and that taxpayers don't foot the bill for a system that doesn't work.' 
More than 1,000 people a year in England and Wales are jailed for possession of drugs for their own personal use.
Mr Clegg says half are for possession of cannabis, but says millions of people know 'intuitively that it does not make sense chucking a 22-year-old into prison for the possession of cannabis. The people who should be behind bars are the criminal gangs, the Mr Bigs'.

He argues that the UK should approach the drug problem as a health rather than a law and order issue.
In a swipe at Mr Cameron's party, he said the Tories were slow to realise that it was time to rethink drugs laws.
Mr Clegg added: 'The Conservatives are what it says on the tin — they are conservatives. They take a long time sometimes to move with the times.
'If there was evidence that banging them up works then all their misplaced tough talk would be justified. But it does not work.'

The Lib Dem manifesto will include a commitment to end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and move the drugs and alcohol policy lead from the Home Office to the Department of Health.
In addition, the party will promise to establish a commission to assess the effectiveness of current drugs laws and alternative approaches, including further work on diverting users into treatment or into civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record, which can seriously affect their chances of employment.

However, the Home Office defended the current law. A spokesman said: 'Drugs destroy lives and cause misery to families and communities and this Government has no intention of decriminalising them.
'The vast majority of people caught in possession of an illegal drug are not imprisoned, with only 3 per cent of offenders found guilty of a drug possession offence last year being sentenced to immediate custody.
'It is vital that the police and criminal justice system have a range of measures available to them, including community-based interventions.
'But law enforcement and the criminal justice system must also have the tools to deal robustly with serious and repeat offenders who cause the most harm in our communities.'

INFOBOX in aticle

Drugs paraphernalia will be given to heroin addicts for free by the government in a bid to deter them from injecting the substance.
Users will be given free foil to help them heat up the class-A drug in an attempt to encourage them to inhale it and thereby avoid the risks of contracting diseases such as HIV.
Aluminium foil is used to warm heroin and breathe in its fumes to get high.
Under current laws health professionals are banned from giving out foil to addicts, but the new rules, thought up by the Home Office, would end this practice.
The scheme is likely to draw criticism from anti-drugs campaigners for fear it could encourage people to take drugs.'

http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-fi-film-tax-credits-20140831-story.html

&gt; Louisiana has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of so-called runaway production, earning the moniker Hollywood South. But a report for the state's office of economic development said its film incentives ended up costing taxpayers there nearly $170 million in 2012 — even after the economic benefits were counted.

&gt; The Massachusetts Department of Revenue estimated that for every dollar of film tax credits awarded, the state got back only 13 cents in revenue from 2006 to 2011. The net cost to the state was $128,575 for every film job created for a Massachusetts resident.

&gt; Michigan, New Mexico and most recently North Carolina have scaled back their incentive programs in one way or another over concerns the cost to taxpayers outweighed the economic benefits.

&gt; North Carolina lawmakers recently decided to drastically reduce film incentives on the heels of a state report that found $30 million in tax incentives led to the creation of just 55 to 70 new jobs in 2011.

&gt; ""Our economists tell us it's the worst return on investment of any of the tax-credit programs,"" said Rep. Paul ""Skip"" Stam, the Republican speaker pro tem of the North Carolina House of Representatives.

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"I'll be honest, firstly £3bn wont really get you a lot of infrastructure. £3bn isn't even really that much when you consider how long the ships take to build.

Say the aircraft carrier takes 10 years to build, thats £0.3bn (or £300m) a year. Since budgets are done yearly based on taxes receipts that are expected over the next 12 months when you've got a huge budget the size of a country to deal with £300m a year is practically nothing.

I'm an auditor and if I had was looking at something where a company was spending £720bn A YEAR and they said ""You know we are really worried about this item here, which costs 0.04% of our total budget every year I'd tell them it's a waste of time looking at it.

Secondly, every hopefully agrees we need to spend SOMETHING on a military, otherwise there would be dire consequences. For one it would ruin our ""special relationship"" with the US which is frankly based more on our strategic military value then our economic one. Secondly one of the primary functions of a government is to protect it's citizens, which it can't do without a military.

So if we need to have a military what do we spend it on? Aircraft carriers are simply the must have item for any country that wants to be able to project it's power across the globe. This doesn't just mean bomb people either, evacuations and rescues can all be based off an aircraft carrier.

If you compare this with the government's pet infrastructure project, HS2, I actually think aircraft carriers are a wiser investment.

HS2 will cost £42.6bn (over 10 times what the aircraft carrier costs) and will take about 15-20 years to complete (£2.13bn-£2.84bn a year, nearly the entire budget for the aircraft carriers).

Now to be fair it will also generate it's own revenue via fares, which the government predicts to be  £34bn over 60 years, or £0.56bn a year for 60 years. When you take the revenue away from the development costs, you're still left with a cost of £10.6bn, or about £0.6bn-£0.7bn a year cost (double the aircraft carrier). Thats assuming the £34bn is profit not just revenue, which I hope it is otherwise the government is pulling a fast one.

Once complete HS2 will benefit several cities in the UK, the biggest one being it halves the time it takes to get from London to Manchester, a reduction of 60 minutes. 

The BBC says each train should hold about 1,100 passengers and based on government revenue estimates they are expecting to make about £1,461,187 a day in fares. 

If we assume tickets on average will be about £100 a ticket, they will need about 14,000 people a day to use HS2 (or 14 trains using the track). If we assume this is reasonable, it means that we are spending £10.6bn to save (at a best case scenario) up to 60 minutes a day for 14,000 people. 

To compare, if we spent the same amount on aircraft carriers, we could have about about 13 aircraft carriers making our navy the second most powerful in the world, second only to the US.

So yeah, I kind of get what you are saying, but when it comes to spending £3bn of the government's money on an aircraft carrier I'm not overly bothered as it has plenty of benefits. On the other hand the government's drive for ""infrastructure"" improvements is resulting in a huge bill to save some time for a handful of people. So be careful what you wish for.

**TL;DR An aircraft carrier costs £3bn and takes 10 years and gives us logistical, international and military benefits. HS2 will cost at least £10.6bn and will only save some time for about 14,000 people a day.** ",0,1412685775,null,0,false,0,cl2rf0c,t3_2ijequ,t1_cl2rf0c,t1_cl2qtbi,null,1426644458,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Most universities are however very commercially aware and will have detailed breakdowns of the costs for each course.  They use these for internal financial management, but are extremetly protective of them and would be reluctant to make them public as they wouldn’t want competitors to know their costs.    


It’s also worth knowing that there is no requirement for the fees from students on a particular course to actually be spent on that course.  It’s very common for the fees from courses that are cheap to run (e.g. primarily book-based courses like English, history, politics, etc.) to subsidise courses that are more expensive to run (eg. Engineering, lab-based sciences, etc.).  So depending on your subject, you might be getting either a lot or not very much for your money.

It only pays 0.5% cashback, but it has no strings, hoops or loopholes. It also has no-load overseas spending.

I've concluded that chasing cashback deals is too much effort. I've spent the last two years doing it and it's messy. It's resulted in issues like having an Amex that nobody accepts, having issues with closed cards that don't stay closed, and so on. 

Nationwide just generally do the job right and give a reasonable incentive to use them. On an average credit card spend of £10k PA I'm missing out on ~£50 from the previous credit card. Or £4 a month. Or £1 a week. It's just not worth the time or effort.

That said, the ""optimal"" path would be to use you Clarity card for £300 of spending, stop at that point (bagging 1.7% cashback on that), and spend the remainder with another provider. MSE has a list of good cashback offers. None are as good as Amazon (in my opinion).

Obviously it's inconvenient to not be able to do animal experiments easily. However, the UK still manages to consistently perform high quality research on an international level. In fact, in terms of impactful research, we are 2nd in the world, only behind the US. This may be *because* of those restrictions pushing scientists to work hard on alternatives - or at least to create a very solid foundation of evidence before moving onto animal studies. That solid foundation built upon methodical experimentation is going to lead to better things than a lazy animal-based study (which you will commonly see coming from asian countries) which only presents basic findings.

With newer creations such as induced pluripotent stem cells, we will start to see even less animal testing in the long run, and I know that a lot of the big journals are not as keen on mouse/rat/rabbit studies as they once were. It's really turning out that mice and rats aren't so great for predicting how humans will respond to something. This Nature review from 2010 (http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v9/n3/full/nrd3078.html) says that animal models are simply inadequate for the advanced drugs that we are now creating.

Why would an egg floating in space increase in mass? *Where does the mass come from?* How can a newly hatched space thingy lay an egg *bigger than its entire body*?  That was so ludicrous they didn't even try to show it on-screen.  This isn't some kind of esoteric physics that you can handwave because nobody understands it anyway.

Some kind of throwaway line about the growing creature developing a [singularity mcguffin] through which it sucked matter from elsewhere in space would have solved this problem, although it wouldn't have made the rest of the episode make any more sense (nobody had any way of knowing whether blowing the creature up would be at all helpful).

How can giant spiders with teeth be ""~~multicellular~~ single-cell organisms""? This was not only stupid but completely unnecessary.

The moon has been an egg all this time and *nobody has ever noticed before*? It continues to be an egg for millennia after this and *nobody ever mentions it*?

Story-wise, I was underwhelmed.  I missed the abortion metaphor until I came here -- it was overshadowed by the contrived  ""innocent alien vs all of mankind"" dilemma. But now I can't unsee it, and it's a pretty disturbing abortion metaphor. Yeah, I can see how the writer may have been framing this as a pro-choice story because three women get to make the choice... but in this analogy, the three women are not the pregnant woman. The Earth is the pregnant woman. The Earth risks injury or death if it allows the foetus to come to term. When the Earth is asked to make a choice, the Earth votes to abort (OK, actually, the governments of Europe and Africa vote to abort. It's not terribly democratic, but it's not like they had a lot of information to go on anyway). Then the Earth is overruled by a small panel of people who have the real power to enforce the decision.  That's... kind of creepy, really.

And of course it's all a massive narrative cheat because the shell harmlessly disintegrates and the baby space thingy lays an identical copy of the moon, and somehow these two magically massive bodies moving around in space have no adverse effect on the tides, since people are watching them from a perfectly calm and normal beach.

The Clara/Doctor argument possibly made the most sense out of the entire episode, but it felt hollow and unearned because the rest of the episode was so terrible.

In terms of my current skincare routine, I'm pretty clueless about this stuff as prior to the pregnancy never needed a skincare regime. My current routine has developed from a process of trial and error as a lot of things seem to irritate or dry out my skin. 

I cleanse with St Ives Blemish Fighting Facial Scrub three times a week (I find it too harsh for everyday). On the other days I use Boots Tea Tree and Witch Hazel Foaming Face wash.

In fact a lot of those figures are a bit misleading. For a start they are purely talking about total GDP and not returns to the exchequer. Then they are taking the number of people employed in the film industry and then claiming that ""For every person employed in the core UK film industry a further job is supported through indirect and induced multiplier impacts."" They then use this claim that they seemingly pulled out of thin air to double their contribution. Finally they add another £1.4billion of ""Cultural tourism, trade and merchandise""

You are not telling me that if the UK film industry did not get £750 million in tax cuts then all of that £4billion would suddenly disappear from the economy. For example, would people not buy merchandise from the upcoming Star Wars movie if it were not filmed in the UK?

So the question is, how much of that economic activity would really disappear if the subsidies were not there?

false,UK_Prime_Minister,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"This is what happens when we allow for the expansion of the university system to cater for courses and people who in all honesty should not be in higher education at all. 

University was supposed to be about academic pursuit, instead today, it serves for most people as merely a stepping stone to a job. It absolutely disgusts me that it has been degraded to this level. Yes, it may be elitist to have this view, but it isn't elitist just for the sake of it - no more so than in any other area of life where you simply have to be the best at that particular area in order to rise to the top of it. When university was like this a few decades ago, it was sustainable because there was only a small minority of people going and they tended to be the best in their respective academic field. So it was acceptable that the taxpayer should shoulder most of the costs because these relatively small number of people would go on to produce good research and other contributions that benefit the rest of society. Now, with the huge number of people going to university, most of whom simply go off to a job that does not require a degree in the first place (although it say so) and therefore not produce anything good out of their university education to the benefit of the rest of society, that system of funding cannot be sustained or justified. 

One of the biggest mistake of the last Labour government, has been to push onto society the view that people SHOULD go to university if they want to be successful. That view is now so entrenched in our society, that jobs which 2 decades ago accepted people straight out of A-levels, now require university degrees from all applicants. People are convinced that they have to go to university and that creates a feedback loop which further reinforces this perception in our society.

An instant-access cash ISA might be the way.

* Once your emergency fund is full, start a stocks &amp; shares ISA. Put money into this regularly and buy low-cost index tracker funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, HSBC have some good options).

Firstly, something I've seen on here a lot was the whole deal with the toy solider. I really think this is a non-issue seeing as how the toy solider would have already been passed through Danny's timeline as a family relic, ending up with Orson who then gave it to Clara. Since Orson and the Doctors timelines are separate it's probable that it is the same toy solider. 

If Danny is the Master he must be the Master at his youngest form, its been pretty clear in Doc-who mytho that Time Lords dont regenerate back into children (for example River Song was a child who grew up into Mel, she didn't regenerate from an adult form into the younger verison of Mel). So if you get behind the idea that Danny is indeed the master then you have a lot of explaining to do seeing as how the Master is known to have grown up in Gall.

But I think that stress and panic can cause people to make bad decisions. It's easy to sit back, when you've got plenty of money for food, to think of ways to save money. When you're hungry and tired, you just want a quick fix, so chicken and chips it is.

Also, if they don't have the facilities to make use of cheaper food then they have to buy pre-made. e.g. pots and bowls for preparation of fresh vegetables, beans, rice. Refrigeration/freezer to make large volumes of cheap food and store it.

I do say that we are paying for profit on their second home, and all it's running expenses.  Have a look at the lists from the expenses scandal a few years ago.  They were filling these second homes with all the ameneties that the rest of us pay for from our salaries.  They claim cookers, and fridges, refitting of kitchens.  Food, wine, Sky, the best computer money can buy, the fastest Internet money can buy, toilet paper, gas, electricity, etc, etc.  All allowed because they are happening in their ""second home"".

All the while, the housing market in London is going up and up, and the longer they own that second home, the more profit they're making.  They need only get themselves an interest-only mortgage, find enough money for a deposit (easy when your day-to-day living expenses are covered by the tax payer) and then wait ten years.  All that capital gain is then theirs.  

Second home though, so capital gains is due, right?  Noooooo, you simply designate this second home as your first home for a while (if it was their first home, then I want all the expenses that we paid for it back), and no capital gains is due.

What stops them, in fact, deciding to flit between these two homes, redesignating each as the ""second home"", whenever they're there, getting lots of repair and maintenance done, and then flitting back to the other once the invoice is settled?  I suspect nothing stops them doing that.

People argue that it's a drop in the ocean on a national budget -- but this is 650 people who should be morally irreproachable (after all the one power that an MP has is the ability to make law) spending £100 million on expenses.  That's 650k per MP _on expenses_.

Imagine all your essentials were being covered -- that would make every penny you earn, essentially, disposable.  You could then invest large portions of that and make yourself even richer.

They don't even see it as bad; that's what makes it worse.  When caught, they don't even think they should be embarassed, they just wheel out ""well, I've got to make regular trips between home and constituency, blah, blah, blah"", as if that somehow explains 650k of expenditure.

No it's not, My wife took time out to care for our children. We didn;t agree to that simply because we thought a babysitter was going to be an abuser. We did it becuase we thought it was best for the childs development. Which so far seems to be fine.

If she was working full time and going to day care, we both agreed that spending time with er mother was far better for her emotional security rather than leaving her in a room full of strangers at such a young age.
Paranoia had nothing to do with it, you should had noticed that be the there parts of my post. Or maybe you just picked up on the anti-feminist areas?

My arguments is that Mrs Cleggs is more interested in her career than her children, and that, in my opinion is harmful to the child's development.

I picked up on the ""have what men have"" because it was a feminist statement. men don't have all the best stuff.
and I have no idea where that myth comes from. in fact, i dare say it's completely 100% false.

&gt;If a woman wants a professional career, she's perpetually hamstrung by views like yours.

Complete rubbish. She is perpetually hamstrung by her own anatomy. Something which neither politicians OR men have any blame what so ever. It sounds like you're un-happy with your anatomy, and men actually have nothing to do with this.

Oh, and don;t down-vote my shit because you don't like it. it makes you look like a spoiled pig.

&gt;So a woman should devote her entire life to her children, to the exclusion of her own personal hopes, dreams and desires, while her husband's perfectly free to do whatever he likes as long as it earns a salary?

this is the exact mentality that destroys any attempts at feminism.
A woman should devote her life to what she seeing as important. if her own personal hopes don;t include looking after her children then that's her choice. You even have a right to it!

&gt;while her husband's perfectly free to do whatever he likes as long as it earns a salary?
See, this is the exact de-tached mentality that I'm talking about.

do you think men in a family keep all their money for the pub on Fridays, wheres as a mother who has recently given birth gets her money from the tooth fairy?

seriously, you're not even trying to be reasonable.

Plenty of corporations are compelled to provide ancillary benefits to the communities in which they operate as a condition of either doing business or gaining one of these ""handouts"". The fixer must surely believe that the benefits outweigh the tax concession, assuming he is not corrupt.

Did you not notice how he thinks Clara's face is all eyes and that Courtney is 35 years old?
About the suit, I noticed that too, but costume management most likely didn't.
That story arc would definitely be cool (and cooler than the actual plot, I'm convinced), but you're reading too much into plot holes. 
Another thing - Clara can pilot the TARDIS (*sigh*), but only in timelines of people connected to her. That's why Danny (she thought about him while piloting) and that's why the Doctor (she thought about him while piloting).

&gt; Similarly, if you accept that we live in a society based on law, you have to accept that all people have a set of inviolable rights (note, not privileges doled out by the state, but natural rights) and things like 'right to vote' and 'right not to have your government send you away for torture' are pretty high priority.

The right to liberty is a natural right, but the whole point of a prison sentence is that you have lost some of your rights. That's why you're in a prison cell to begin with.

The current migration policy in the EU has nothing to do with race.

It has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with nationality. 

If you're going to claim the EU migration policy is racist because it is based on nationality, you may as well call *any* migration policy between two countries based upon nationality (e.g. our open borders with Ireland, our preferential treatment over some other countries in getting Visas for Turkey) racist. Or you could call any trade agreement between two countries favouring goods from those countries (e.g. the proposed new free trade EU from a lot of anti-EU groups) racist. But you wouldn't, because it isn't based on race, it's based on what nationality you hold.

Why is he rejecting large chunks of his past? (Did you know that his very close friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart taught maths for awhile after he retired? I think the Brig's daughter Kate is going to have some interesting conversations with the Twelfth Doctor later this series...)

Now look at Labour.  With Blair, Brown and now Ed Milliband, it's clear that Labour are hopeless at getting rid of unpopular leaders.  There were a few attempts to ditch Blair and Brown when they were at their most unpopular with the public, but ultimately the vast majority of Labour MPs stood by their leader.  And the same is happening with Ed Rubberband.  The public has not taken to Ed.  Labour know this, but they're not going to do anything about it.  Even if Ed loses the next election (which is looking more likely now), the party faithful will wait for Ed to resign rather than force him out.  And this is why Labour spend most of their time in the political wilderness.  The Tories are ruthless with their leaders, but they know how to keep themselves fresh.

Because they don't want to pay you, and want to add hoops for you to jump through in the hope you'll fail.

My fiance had to go through the same thing - claiming ESA for depression, and needing to be assessed by ATOS. And as with you, the assessments themselves (he had two) set back his recovery. I had to go with him - he was too anxious to go alone or to take the bus, and they said we'd get a travel cost reimbursement but we never did. They stopped his benefits and screwed up the appeal (they said we'd get a letter telling us the hearing date within 10 to 15 weeks. The next letter we got told us we hadn't attended the hearing so had been denied benefits), and because I was just about earning enough to support us both, with further help from my parents (in the form of not paying them rent to live in a flat they bought for us to live in), he decided it was more trouble than it was worth and gave up.

What's your coping mechanism? How do you normally deal with this sort of thing when you go out? Do you plan your schedule and create alternate plans for if, eg, you miss the bus etc? Do you keep your fingers busy with some little activity like shuffling a deck of cards or making origami cranes or whatever? I've heard people have used crochet to help deal with anxiety, and I heartily recommend it as a hobby anyway.

In any case, planning in advance so you don't have too much that's unexpected should help. Maybe consider the kinds of questions you might be asked, and prepare answers for them.

Be warned, though. The first assessment with ATOS my fiance had, the first thing the nurse said after ""take a seat"" was ""have you thought about suicide?"" Just like that, no introductory questions, no easing in gently, just straight to the big question. Which shook my fiance up a lot. And left me pretty stunned too (I'd never be allowed into his therapy sessions if the therapist was talking about that sort of thing, it's not something you talk about in front of a third party, and the nurse should have asked me to step outside for a minute for that, for the sake of patient confidentiality).

On the other hand, the lady in the second assessment session was nicer and friendly and made my fiance feel very secure and confident, but that resulted in him being assessed as ""not depressed enough"", because it was a good day and a nice lady so he wasn't as bad as normal. So maybe even if you do feel relaxed and confident, don't let it show, don't smile, don't relax, play up your symptoms a little.

I went to hull school of art and design and failed second year where I didnt attend for 80% of the academic year and spent most of the time in panic and stress and going through all the worst case scenarios and events that were going on in my life at that time. Not only did the school overwork us but they didn't listen when we came together as a class and said ""this is too much"". On top of this I had my own personal problems which all just seemed to pile on top of each other and it didn't really help that student finance was delayed for me every year either for whatever reason, but my family were too poor to help me as much as I needed and could spare £50-100 a month. I had a job throughout first year which helped me eat until I finally got my loan in February and was able to pay my rent. But after that I felt too emotionally and mentally broken to get another job I felt like I couldnt do it and no one would want someone who's feeling down.

After that I moved to university of Huddersfield hoping for a better experience. Second year there was a lot more enjoyable and I learnt a lot and I finally thought I was okay for a while and that it was the previous course I did and not me. But then I went into third year were I didn't enjoy it much and lost motivation (in comparison to second year). And I started to feel similar again to my failed year in hull. It wasn't the same tho. I wasn't overworked or anything like before. But I was starting to hate what I once loved doing and feeling really down again. 

Regardless of my own personal experience (and big ramble here), one thing I've come to notice is that I was never alone when I felt how I felt. I mean, when I failed second year and moved uni, a good chunk of our class failed and I moved uni with a friend of mine to Huddersfield. I came to realise that I don't think I've ever met anyone at uni (who I became friends with and got to know - and even a few who I barely knew) who weren't depressed at uni at some point of it and just wanted out.

What does benefit fraud have to do with this? I'm talking about benefits people are fairly entitled to.

""and never actually looking at the huge, wide scale depravity that occurs with corporate welfare abuse and fraud""
This is a massive talking point on its own, but a few things I will say:

1) Giving tax subsidies to businesses to provide jobs for the local economy is not the same thing as benefits to individuals.

2) You can't actually tax companies. They aren't people, they are organisations and all profits are either re-invested in the business, given to owners/shareholders (as dividend), or employees (as salary). A business does not keep money for its own sake. Any tax you levy on a company is effectively just an increased cost for them in doing business, and (just like any other increased business cost) will lead to higher prices for the consumer. So taxing companies is basically just a stealth tax on individuals, and a poor one at that, as it has a negative effect on overall growth, making everyone poorer. 
The exception to this is when talking about a company like Amazon, who pay no corporation tax but are competing with those that do.

Ashley Westwood - came from League 2 basically. Expected him to be off the pace coming from a lower division like that. Was puzzled why Lambert didn't phase him in more gradually. Played awfully in his first couple of games, wasn't used for a month, probably did a lot of work in training, came back and has been good for us ever since. Every now and then he is still caught by the pace when he is trying to tackle, and it makes him seem like a malicious player.

Christian Benteke -  had a somewhat decent cameo as a substitute in his debut. In his first game from start however he didn't impress too much, seemed to lose the ball too often, and had a bad first touch. Improved a lot over the next few games and had a fantastic first season for us. Never reached those heights after his first injury, but hopefully he can get back to that level soon. 

Fabian Delph - I always believed in him for some strange reason, just as I do with Bennett, but I'll be the first to admit that his first years at Villa he seemed out of his depth in the Premier League. Took massive steps during Lambert's first season, and is in my opinion, our best player. 

Charles N'Zogbia - I've given up on him. Whatever he showed at Wigan was most likely a fluke that lasted way too long. He is well into his prime, had experience from the Premier League before joining Villa, he's been given too many chances, and he still performs like that. What else can I say than I look forward to getting rid of him. 

These are the players that I would compare Sanchez' first games with. Three of them got massive advantages over Sanchez with their age and also coming from lower leagues. La Liga's pace should be closer to the Premier League than League 1 &amp; 2 and Jupiler League. I would like for Sanchez to prove me wrong, but I think he will end up somewhere in between El Ahmadi and Makoun. 

I know that there are a lot of different players that haven't performed to well in Villa the last few years, but from what I remember these five players have had the worst couple of first games. And yes, that means I would pick Heskey over Benteke, Hogg over Westwood, and Bowery over Delph, if I just judged them by their first couple of games.

Gender is how you perceive yourself. Usually a man perceives himself as a man and a woman as a woman but sometimes a biological (sex) man perceives herself as a woman and vice versa. 

A ""sex change"" doesn't actually change the biological sex but tries to make the body look more like that of the perceived gender (turn a penis into a ""vagina"" and gain tits and more hip fat for instance).

North London has only 1 team, there is another team from Woolwich that plays nearby for some reason. - explaination: Woolwich is in east london just south of the river, and is where the Arsenal come from, hence not really from North london. Only Spurs. Arsenal also known as Woolwich wanderers.

It is best if we don't have stars, our stars all leave for real madrid (recent) or ManU (historic). 

Players of great note (but not stars! as stars get sold..)

* Eriksen - everything good that ever happens starts here
* Hugo Lloris - everything bad didn't happen because Hugo singly stoped in from happening 
* Lamela - all our hopes and dreams are carried within
* Chadli - Smooth like a Dolphin - enough said (for a silly time listening to other spurs fans the Fighting Cock podcast is great)
* Capoe - the Wall - its like watching someone play 'nope' with opposition midfields

We also generally have all the midfielders, none of the strikers (since Berba left), and actually... our defense seems okay now.. which is odd and not very spursy

Spursy = if something bad can happen from a good position, it probably will, usually with a heavy dose of irony attached to the event. 
eg. Spurs strikers all start scoring amazingly - somehow, we will still miss out on the Wenger Shield due to the scum(another name for arsenal) going on a 10 game win streak to deny us on goal difference (the actual truth will be that we threw away a very winable game 2 weeks earlier that would've locked it the previous week).

Wenger Sheild = 4th place ""as good as a trophy"" oft quoted from that manager of some Woolwich club (see what I did there).

We are Traditionally a Cup team, were the first non-league team to ever win the FA cup(1901) and the first team to win the double of both the league and the FA cup in the same year (1961), we have won the FA cup 8 times, last in 1991, which at the time was the record (ManU and Scum have since passed that).

we are also known as the yids(only to each other - never by someone else!), and the Lillywhites.

Hopefully that gives a small window into some of the character of the club that you now support.

false,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; What do you mean when you say you’re “generally critical of equality”? Is there no division of wealth you’d find problematic? If, say, 99.99% of the wealth was concentrated among 0.01% of the population, would that be ok? Is there any number of 9’s which would cause you to think that the division has effects on society which are bad?

I'm not really interested in questions that are unlikely to have any practical implication in the real world, and the idea that an infinitesimally small portion of the population could control an infinitesimally large portion of the wealth is a scenario that invites such questions.

So far as British politics goes I think it is the default position that ""equality of opportunity"" should exist in the basic sense that people are not prevented from doing anything because of class, race or sex. You might term is ""equality before the law"" for the sake of clarity, and I agree with it so far as public service goes (I'm a little sceptical as to whether private firms should be allowed to discriminate on those grounds in hiring, but that's a side issue).

When I say I'm ""generally critical of equality"" I refer to the modern concept of it, where people expect each demographic to be equally represented in all fields, and for issues of class, gender and culture to have no effect on how people live their lives. Obviously that's the hard version of the view, which is rare, but milder forms are very common, particularly on the left. 

Why that bothers me would take a long time to explain, but I suppose at root I dislike the authoritarianism involved in implementing it. This kind of rolls into another of your points: I value freedom above equality, at least of the modern sort. Clearly that basic form of equality before the law is a prerequisite for freedom, but I would say the more extensive forms of equality are antithetical to freedom, or at least the sort of freedom I think desirable. That clearly impacts my view of Wilkinson's policy advice, and probably his work too.

&gt; Whatever the dictionary versus colloquial definitions of “polemic” are, you used the word to denigrate Wilkinson’s work and I’m contending that there was no good reason to do so. You let Saunders off very lightly because you agree with him – and he may be right, but his arguments aren’t convincing or entirely honest and, from an academic, I would have expected something with far less obvious personal bias and far more substance.

I called Wilkinson's work a polemic because I don't believe it is sound in its logic, whereas I think Saunders' work is sound in its logic. Both clearly have personal biases. As for general engagement, I think for the majority of the public the technicalities of the argument are too fraught right now. If science reaches a consensus opinion on this issue then I think it should start talking to the public. I just don't think that time is now.",0,1412695231,null,0,false,0,cl2v7tz,t3_2ib9w2,t1_cl2v7tz,t1_cl1zsou,null,1426642609,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also incidentally the argument about tax avoidance has always seemed a little skewed to me, yes it's entirely legal but given then the state has paid for the education of their employees (quite useful if they can at least read after all), their health when they get sick, the police and courts that prosecute those that may steel or vandalise at their sites, the roads that get people to their sites as well as the public transport etc why do they then not have to give something back?

No, the Welsh Government offered it lower 'rent' to do business in a particular area.

The money isn't being spent on you, it goes into the main pot for the university and the main expenditure they want to finance is research. Universities are judged on their prestige,  which is based on the people they have working for them who are judged (roughly) on the quality of their work. 

Fees are causing a huge headache because people like you now want to be treated as a customer, paying to be educated. And to be fair you have a right to that. However the university does not have the resources to both cover its main reason for existing (I.e. furthering human knowledge) and provide you with intensive education. If they don't pay for the best research and researchers their reputation and prestige will drop and they'll attract less students even if their teaching is excellent.  If they have excellent research then they have great ratings and attract lots of money pots... I mean undergrads, who then complain about the quality of teaching. And nobody cares.

false,DirtD4er,null,null,"My thoughts:

First, lets pause for a second and look at our DEPTH!  We have had every signing this year look to be coming good.  Sakho (!!!), Valencia, Song, Amalfitano (I love his work rate, plus he looks SO French), Zarate, Cresswell, and Jenkinson (I doubt there's a chance we could get him permanently, but that would be nice).  We have Carroll and Nolan out injured, along with Noble, and we're still playing like this?  I started following West Ham in 2010, and this is easily the most excited I've been about our potential.  We have so many potential formations we could play besides 4-5-1 it's awesome, and I'm starting to wonder if Sam's tactical rigidity previously was limited by his player selection or not.  I mean, we're playing 2 up front!

In regards to the diamond, it is sounding like Sam is OK for sticking with it for now; 4-3-1-2 is here to stay I think, as long as we keep playing 2 strikers.  I think the key to it is our strikers at the moment, I'll touch on that in a bit.  Downing in the hole is looking excellent, and Noble/Song/Kouyate makes a pretty good base for the diamond.  Obviously we're not playing wingers with this formation so we're lacking width, and are tending to clog up midfield a little more (interesting choice for BFS, no?).

So the lack of width is our primary area of concern with this formation, which is why we see Cresswell and Jenkinson marauding so far forward (potentially leaving us open at the back to a counterattack).  I think the reason we're not seeing them exposed so far is the work rate of Sakho and Valencia (man I love these guys!), they are running back on defense, working down the wings, tracking the opposing fullbacks, and then running back up top when we get possession.  And they are scoring goals for us.

I think we stick with this until Nolan and/or Carroll make a return into the starting lineup.  (Come on Sam.  Leave Nolan out of it, he's past it, we all know it - but he's just about right to make a super sub).  Nolan in my opinion will not work at the top of the diamond in this formation due to his obvious lack of stamina and work rate; I think it's a large part of why he's been subbed in at the end of the last two matches is that he can still run for about 20 minutes, even if that's it.  Hopefully Sam will continue to choose the formation and the team over his Captain Kev.

Carroll is an interesting situation.  With Sakho and Valencia playing so well will he even have a place in the lineup when he returns to fitness?  Can he play in the diamond?  I think he's underrated with the ball at his feet, but he's such a weapon with his head that without wingers whipping in crosses, and his less of a work rate compared to Valencia and Sakho, he won't be as good a fit in that formation.

Which gives us an awesome second option, if I was in charge.  Sub in Nolan and Carroll for Sakho and Valencia if they aren't performing, push Downing out to the wing to whip in crosses.  Suddenly we're playing a whole different style, we're switching it up, and it's a style most of the team has a lot of experience with.  They know how to play it, even if it is somewhat ugly.

I haven't mentioned pressure to play Carroll as our club record signing.  I don't know if that's an angle worth examining or not, in regards to playing time, but I think it's interesting (whether positive or negative) that Carroll and Jarvis, both of whom were record signings at the time, are probably not in our best 11.  But neither of them are so terribly bad they don't have a place in the team either, which brings me back to my first point:  DEPTH!",0,1412696904,null,0,false,0,cl2w2cv,t3_2ihx86,t1_cl2w2cv,t3_2ihx86,null,1426642213,3,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,3

false,HedonisticVibrations,null,null,"Because the Film industry has huge and clearly defined linkages to other industries that bring people into the UK, for tourism purposes as well as purely for making movies, thats why. Its essentially marketing the UK overseas to a very wide selection of people, perhaps greater than any other industry that we have. 

An example of this is Visit Britian. The most succesful Visit Britain campaign ever, was a simple map of the UK showing where famous films were made. (Im sorry I dont have a source for this, I was told this during a presentation at the World Travel Market last year, ill see if I can dig it out as I am sure I have it somewhere). 

It is also pretty naive to think that the film industry is the only one getting tax breaks, it might be the most high profile, but personally feel that is because of the clear evidence of it in affect, there is the UK on screen to millions of people in full technicolour, surely showing the policy is working, getting the UK out there. 

Cultural benefit is difficult to measure, maybe impossible to quantify in monetary terms, and there are clear arguments against doing so but it comes down to what type of nation you want to be. Do you want to be a nation where cultural and creative industries such as film are supported and able to thrive, or not. 

Personally I would rather the creative industries be supported, they provide jobs to people, especially the young, help diversify our economy, are usually on the forefront of technologicaly advancement and general 'creativity', have clear linkages to tourism, one of the biggest inudstries in the world, is good for people in general, have cache on the world stage and market the UK as a great to do business with a creative and cutting edge workforce.

Their manifesto reads like a fantasists wish list precisely because they know they'll never be in government. This becomes a self fulfilling problem as if they don't take themselves seriously, why the hell would the rest of the electorate? 

Personally I have it fairly easy - I live in a Lib Con marginal, so my choice is really only between them (if you disagree with tactical voting, that's fine, I want my vote to matter, and without PR that means voting tactically). 

Conservatives are promising £25bn in cuts... without specifying where those cuts are coming from, that worries me. Ulimately, though, you know where you stand with the Tories. They will harm the poor, they will pander to the rich, the elderly and big business. They will do these things as a matter of *principle* - and probably try to spin it as something else. 

Labour - Yes, Ed is weak, but that's not their problem... their problem is that they've lost their guiding principles, they don't know what they stand for any more other than being the NotTory Party and generally preferring being in power to not being in power. There's a reactive twitch towards ""fuck the rich"" at the moment which I don't much like either (yes, they should pay their fair share, and yes it should be more than the less well off... but I'm not sure about all the proposed layers of taxation, and I'd much rather companies were forced to pay their fair share too - and yes, I know how complex that is). 

Lib Dems - I have some sympathy for them. **Tuition Fees was not their fault** they never expected to be in government, and the Tories were never going to let them keep that promise. As a matter of principles I sort of know where they stand on most issues, conference has been all about ""look how different from the Tories we are"" rather than ""this is what we stand for"" which is a bit of a shame, but probably necessary.

I'm not even going to talk about your depression, etc, because I've never suffered from it and i'm not naive enough to think I know what you're going through.

So here's what'll happen - your atos assessment is strict and very focused. Its designed to determine not how hard you'd find it to follow a daily working schedule, but to find out how much you can do.

It would be easy for me to say ""don't panic"", and I can imagine how hard you'd find it to not panic, but really, this is what you need to do. There is a clear and simple process to follow and all you need to do is jump through the right hoops at the right time.

Its most likely that you will be deemed able to work following the assessment. You will get a phone call a couple of weeks later and they will tell you what happens next. You will need to immediately sign on for jsa. This will be processed the same day you phone them (and you HAVE to phone them, you can't do it online and you can't do it at a Jobcentre. There's a process in place at the DSS which means they process your new JSA claim immediately if you're coming from ESA) and you will not suffer any break of benefits. Do not put this off. Despite what you've heard about jsa, refugees from esa are common and I've basically been treated very nicely - meaning mostly I'm being ignored - my job search isn't being checked and what help they can give, they have given. So far I've got a new pair of shoes out of them, which could have been a full suit, and I've got a claim form to help with funding for a £2000+ professional IT course.

The esa claim will go for mandatory reassessment, during which time you can't get esa, which is why you sign on for jsa. When the reassessment is done, they'll phone you again. If the decision is upheld, you can appeal by taking your case to tribunal. The tribunal request forms are online. Its at this point you should look for representation and help from places like the CAB and any benefits advisory service which might operate in your area.

Once the tribunal date is set, you can go back on esa until the court date. You can choose to attend or not, and you should get every medical professional involved with your treatment to write something in support.

Once again, don't panic. look on it as just a bit of a blip in your year. Do the legwork, be honest at the assessment and keep your nose clean and bullshit your way through the month on jsa. You'll be fine.

* Edited for typos, because my phone typing sucks.

Extra: All the way through the Reassessment process, I've had a phrase repeated to me: ""We know you have health issues which make it hard for you to find work"". They do take account that you aren't in actual fact employable - or at least that you're far less attractive to an employer than the 50 or so able bodied people they've also interviewed. At my introductory JSA interview, I said point blank, when discussing the requirement to do around 35 hours a week Jobsearch, that everyone who claimed they were actually doing the 35 hours a week was lying - the reply, from Jobcentre staff was that, as they couldn't prove the people were lying, they were ignoring it and accepting the timings people were giving them. Unless you have the misfortune of getting a hardass claims advisor, you can make up as much of your Jobsearch as you like. You just need to LOOK LIKE you're doing it.

You'll only be claiming for a month or so, so as long as you LOOK LIKE you're doing what they want, you'll be fine.",0,1412697770,null,0,1412698853,0,cl2wid0,t3_2ik7ul,t1_cl2wid0,t3_2ik7ul,null,1426642006,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

false,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Because the Film industry has huge and clearly defined linkages to other industries that bring people into the UK, for tourism purposes as well as purely for making movies, thats why. Its essentially marketing the UK overseas to a very wide selection of people, perhaps greater than any other industry that we have.

I am a bit sceptical about this. I can see why people who have chosen to visit the UK might want to look for film locations, but that's not the same as coming to the UK purely because a specific film was made here. 

When I was on holiday in Italy, we went to Turin and I enjoyed spotting locations where the original Italian Job was made. That doesn't mean that I chose to go to Italy purely because of a movie though. 

&gt; It is also pretty naive to think that the film industry is the only one getting tax breaks

Why should any particular industry get tax breaks over other industries?

&gt; Do you want to be a nation where cultural and creative industries such as film are supported and able to thrive, or not.

I don't believe that tax breaks are the most effective way of promoting cultural activity. They do seem to be open to abuse (Gary Barlow springs to mind).

false,bustergonad,null,null,"The point of the question, and the extreme case it posits, is to see if you truly think that an extreme distribution of wealth i.e. extreme inequality, makes any difference. You’re no fool, so I’m disappointed you dodged it – but either way, it illustrates my point.

I’m no believer in *total* redistribution of wealth, that would be the other extreme and both extremes are wrong – I know you’d agree with the latter case and hoped you would in the former, though you declined to answer. It’s not controversial to state that there has been a very substantial change in the division of wealth to the benefit of the rich. I think this is relevant to the health of a society (and a bad thing). Are you saying it has no bearing on society, it’s not a metric that matters? Or that it does, but you don’t care because your freedom takes precedence? 

I also believe in equality of opportunity (who doesn’t?) but it’s simplistic to claim that it’s easy to achieve and just a matter of ignoring how wealth is acquired and distributed, or making the law blind to race, gender etc. Being born to rich parents, white, in a wealthy country, being the first born in a family, male, good looking and many other factors give unfair opportunities to a lucky few – they tend to do better than others. I’m guessing that, like me, you were born lucky in several ways and often discount that luck when we measure our success. Opportunities aren’t as equally distributed as all that and it’s certainly not as simple as there not being legalized discrimination.

I’ll not comment on British politics – I lived there for a while (and miss it), but a while ago, and my knowledge is doubtless dated.

Each demographic being represented in every field isn’t what I had in mind and does sound like extreme social engineering – my primary concern is the distribution of wealth, since that’s changed so much recently. I think there’s a large area of acceptable variability for things, but when there have been large changes, as there have been, there is a bad effect on the society and action is required, if only to explain why the condition exists and if something can or should be done. I think we’d both agree that extremes on either side are bad. As thinking people we’re not obliged to swallow either Wilkinson or Saunders whole, they both obviously have axes to grind. If only some of Wilkinson’s points are valid, then there’s a reason to take action, he doesn’t have to be 100% right and present every possible analysis beyond dispute – nobody meets that standard. If you can only concede that it’s possible there’s a range of distribution of wealth which benefits everybody in society, then we’ll have found common ground. There’s no avoiding the authoritarian aspect of this since tax policy has a huge effect on it, and that’s not going away any time soon.

I’ll add at this point – though we disagree, thanks for making some interesting points and remaining civil throughout (except for your first message, which I assume was due to you having a bad day or too much experience on reddit).

A subsidy however can be a number of different financial incentives to offset the price of something. Although this can be tax breaks it can also be loan guarantees, or one time financial contributions. Agricultural policy subsidies for instance include direct financial payments under the Common Agricultural Policy, as do fishing subsidies.

Well you can, in the form of Corporation tax. It's not a stealth tax, everyone knows about it, it's not hidden, it's not called something else or collected on the pre-tense of being one thing yet actually being another.  It's not an increased cost of doing business any more that forces costs up any more than Income Tax increases personal wage.  It's a % of profits that are paid back paid back to the country the company operates in for the privilege of doing so.

Unfortunately too many massive companies like to do the old tax avoidance ruining things for the rest of us by either forcing up our own personal taxes or by forcing cuts on public spending.  

And it can be beneficial to companies also. 1 example would be to have an exemplary health care system. If the NHS had more money, provided by corporations paying what they owe, then the general overall health of the country would increase.  Less people regularly sick the less man hours lost due to illness.

Same with public transport, better, more reliable, cheaper public transport system, thus less people late to work (or not at work at all in the case of really terrible weather like heavy snow) thus less man hours lost. Also cheaper public transport means cheaper overheads to companies that regularly have staff travelling the country.

More money to spend on schools. Better educate young people entering the work market giving companies a better selection of people to choose from thus having more intelligent, diligent, hard working people that could prove very beneficial to them.

Better schools, better healthcare, maybe more police alongside an improved welfare system and a host of other things creating a general better standard of living for everyone and you'll find crime goes down. Less theft, less graffiti, arson etc ... means companies have less to pay in insurance premiums.

Companies having money isn't the only thing that fuels growth, but a health, stable environment to operate in with a happy, healthy and stable work force.  That only comes from the money the country has to spend on the it's own up keep, and that can't always come from the work force for the privilege working, but must come from the companies that make money here for the privilege they have of making that money here and benefiting from the society around it.",0,1412699708,null,0,false,0,cl2ximd,t3_2ijequ,t1_cl2ximd,t1_cl2uqao,null,1426641536,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Not to mention the other companies that own and run nuclear reactors across the country, which are potentially in planned, or unplanned shutdowns.

So which part of my original comment isn't true?

My point was that if the Nuclear power stations were running to planned and expected operations (2 EDF reactors are currently on unplanned shut down) the wind energy probably won't have produced as much as nuclear power on Monday morning.

The fact that the wind power has produced as much as nuclear power for the first time isn't solely to do with the number and ability of wind farms to produce energy, its more to do with unforeseen shutdowns and a very windy night.

I'm not saying it isn't an important mile stone for renewable energy sources, but I think we need to recognise the factors that have lead to this milestone being reached.

&gt;In that case it's become obvious why you actively choose not to understand my analogy, and turn this into a race issue.

I was questioning why YOU were making it into a race issue, when the OP article is about a man, who has links to a racist organisation makes racist comments to a man, whom he dislikes already, being a good samartican. If that doesn't make you a cunt, nothing else will

&gt;“He was swearing and saying things like ‘why would I take that off you, you Muslim, you’re not British’.

If he was a member of the KKK and shouting at black people, I'd call him a cunt too, even if he wasn't being racist at someone, when you're trying to be helped and you throw that back in their face. YOU ARE A CUNT.

It's something we see a lot of on the internet and I wish we as internet citizens could learn to recognize a little easier. A few things:

""Doctor Who Event"". Really? Nothing more creative of more appealing than that? That's already a red flag to me, if this were something legit you'd have something a little more catchy that people will remember, ""Doctor Who Events"" happen every weekend currently when Doctor Who comes on TV.

You are NOT allowed to sell tickets on amazon. [See here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_cn?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200685950), I wouldn't expect many to know this, but it should be a red flag when a vendor you've never bought tickets through before and never see tickets on, is suddenly selling tickets. I assure you 100% if you go to amazon that you purchased a ticket through here, you will be refunded. There's no way he'll be able to stop you. They will side with you, they often side with you regardless anyway, this is a breach of their terms there's no reason they won't side with you. 

I would avoid attending events that aren't at least somewhat endorsed by the BBC. First, you're going to get stuck with writers or bit players or behind the scenes people, the major actors won't be able to appear for contract reasons if the BBC isn't involved. Second, if the BBC isn't involved who's to say you're not being scammed? Another red flag. 

Finally his reactions, these are the reactions of someone who's been busted and is trying to save face. He'll blame others and try to destroy the evidence, he's still trying to cash in on those who may not be as on top of it as others and see stories like this. 

Spread the word if you're in these areas, if you see posters or something up for these events, put your own up next to it or take it down or write on it how it's a fraud, everyone needs to know. Maybe call news outlets in these areas, they surely like exposing people who are trying to take advantage of others.

An innocent party who gets stopped and confronted can use *reasonable force* to leave the premises if a security guard attempt to detain them falsely.

My experiences with local youth activists and those I've met on demonstrations were what finally put me off the party for good- they're so often blissfully unconcerned with economic reality. Only in the Greens would you find, say, people going on trips to Venezuela out of uncritical admiration for Hugo Chávez, for example.

&gt;I'm not sure there is any 'bizarre populism' in their manifesto.

Populism is probably the wrong word. But their manifesto this year had some flat-out unrealistic stances - the EU switching to 45% renewable power generation in the next 16 years and, in the same period, cutting overall energy usage by 40%, for example. 

I like a lot of their policies a great deal- their stances on animal welfare and agriculture are the best of any somewhat-mainstream party by quite a way. But things like their stance on emissions reductions *alongside a total opposition to nuclear energy* are insane. 

&gt; If you could recommend a more sensible course of action than joining and campaigning for the Greens to reform our broken political system, achieve a greater degree of economic justice and avoid environmental destruction I'm all ears.

Given the unfortunate persistence of FPTP, the Lib Dems. On policy and record, they're significantly better than (modern) Labour or the Conservatives- and, unlike the Greens, *actually have a chance to get things done*.

Policy is formulated by consultation with and votes from the general membership. In coalition, a great deal of that policy has managed to make its way into the government's programme- including the first serious attempts at electoral reform and an elected House of Lords that have ever got that far.

false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,"&gt; collected on the pre-tense of being one thing yet actually being another

This is exactly what Corporation tax is. The pre-tense is that you're taxing a company, but the reality is that you are taxing people involved in the company, be it the owners, employees or consumers. Why? *Because a company is not a person.*  Companies don't exist for their own self, they exist solely to make money for their owners, providing jobs/salary to employees in the process.

So if we take 20% of their profit yearly what will that mean? 

Less money is invested back into the business, which is bad for long term growth and sustainability of the business and the livelihoods it supports. 

Less for the owners as dividends. This seems great on the face of it, but of course in reality dividends are taxed as income anyway! So they'd get the tax there either way.

You could say it's also 20% less for employees, but in practicality they are paid whatever the market rate is for labour regardless. If the labour rate is too high, the company doesn't make any profit in the first place.

Now if this is a local or national company, the lower investment back into the business due to profit taxation will lead to a less competitive business on the world stage, thus a smaller less successful business and less employees. 

It gets worse still if this is a multinational company. Multinational companies already know what margin they are willing to accept on their product before putting it on sale. So if we tax Apple's UK profits at 20%, what will they do? Put up the price of iPhones 20% in UK shops. They aren't going to simply accept that they make less money in the UK market than elsewhere. Of course in practicality a lot of multinational companies don't really pay any corporation tax, which makes the whole matter even worse, because it means that national companies are operating at a huge disadvantage against multi-national companies that can funnel away profits to a subsidiary in Barbados.

Also consider that investors want the best rate of return on their investment. So if UK company profits are taxed where they aren't in Argentina, all things being equal they will of course invest there instead as they will get a better return. The whole thing is a vicious circle.

Do you understand any of what I am saying here?

We all know what they're capable of but Lansbury especially just looks well off his usual all action game and could do with a kick up the arse to show him that despite constant premier league interest and the fact that he's definitely one of the best midfielders in the Championship he still has to be at the top of his game to keep getting game time.

The whole atmosphere of the show during series 5 felt extremely dumbed down. The episodes were simplistic and sloppy. The Doctor was a child himself (although Smith's performance definitely matured during his era).

It first struck me when I first visited the Doctor Who Experience during the trial run in London Olympia. Everything about it felt so childish. I was the oldest one there that day and I was 16 at the time. There were kids playing with the toys they'd just bought from the gift shop. It was the one time I questioned the audience of Doctor Who and the first time I ever felt too old for the show. 

Things definitely improved in series 6 (although not drastically) and then again in series 7. 

I guess I just didn't like how young the main cast were, I don't think Smith's Doctor was very strong and suddenly the stories had lost their charm and cleverness.

We've played some pretty bad sides at good times - several of Blackpool's players were probably still introducing themselves to each other on the pitch, Reading had about half a side out, Fulham spent half the game seemingly trying to get Magath sacked etc, and when we have played reasonable sides, we've had some pretty smash and grab results, like Bournemouth and Shef Wed.

That doesn't mean we've been terrible - you're not going to be unbeaten and 2nd in the table after almost a quarter of the season by being a terrible side - but we've been quite reliant on a couple of key areas to get us the results. Our centre backs - particularly Mancienne - and keeper have looked solid, and with Assombalonga and Antonio making the most of their chances, we've been able to pick up a fair number of points.

Take those areas away though, and I struggle to think of many solid performances over 90 minutes against any half decent sides. 

That's the negative. The positive is that it's still a new side. I think the early results have blinded a few people into forgetting that teams usually take some time to gel, and the chances are that over the coming months they're going to get to know each other a lot better and start producing better football.

If anything, the second half against Ipswich was possibly our best 45 mins of the season (if you ignore the middle period of the Spurs cup game). In the first half we looked poor in the middle of the park again - both central midfielders seemed to be trying to play the holding roll, which meant acres of space behind the front two. But in the second half Landsbury moved forward and that, coupled with him having the best game he's had since coming back meant we actually put on a pretty good show against a very strong Ipswich side.",0,1412706902,null,0,false,0,cl315ox,t3_2ih2qk,t1_cl315ox,t3_2ih2qk,null,1426639838,1,false,nffc,t5_2uhk6,1

For me it was never that bad, just a bitterness and anger at how overworked we were and how competitive and self-serving many of the other students were. That and finding that I'd worked hard all through my school life with everyone congratulating me and praising me for doing so well (relative to most other people in school at least), only to get onto a challenging course at a top uni and realise how little that mattered. That was the one thing I was good at, and suddenly I was just average (this didn't bother me as I knew it would be like that) and I lacked so many other important skills to help me get a job that I'd missed the chance to develop to focus on my studies. It felt like I had been lied to all my life, but luckily I was able to confront the issue and gained some really good development from extra-curricular activities.

My story is pretty standard though, it was a far worse affair for a good friend who was driven to attempting suicide from the environment there (though with some specific factors in the mix not entirely related to the uni). Individual staff at the department were very understanding and gave my friend lots of support and concessions, as well as giving me some help when they understood I was directing attention away from my own work to help my friend. However the overall system, I felt, was rigid and unaccommodating - I don't feel it recognised my friend's suffering or my sacrifices, nor did it acknowledge the wide spread mental health issues among students and change accordingly. Medical help was also difficult to come by for my friend, who only found proper help after the suicide attempt.

Other than that one friend I didn't know much about other peoples' troubles but whenever the subject came up in conversation I was surprised that so many of my friends at uni had encountered these problems to varying extents and many had been to counselling.

That's still the case. It's hard to see how the Conservatives can win. Labour's vote is mostly solid whilst they will win some seats of the Liberals. The Tories themselves suffer a disadvantage in the way the boundaries are drawn so require a higher share of the popular vote than Labour would, they failed to get a majority last time, and UKIP are now on the scene.

So my oldest son goes by the title ""Earl"", borrowing my second highest title.

All the titles are actually mine - I'm not legally passing the titles to my children. That will only happen when I die, and depending on the system of inheritance it's likely that my oldest child will inherit all the titles together. It's just that my death is far off in the future, but my heir(s) need to hold respect in society until that time and so we all engage in this act where we pretend that they have titles too.

The situation with the Prince of Wales is similar to this.

In Wales, though it used to be divided into ""kingdoms"", the rulers generally didn't refer to themselves as kings, but rather princes. As the kingdoms consolidated, eventually there was one ""Prince of Wales"" (though this line was interrupted many times as kingdoms split up once more).

Following the conquest of Wales by Edward I, rule of Wales was subsumed into the English Crown and there were no more Welsh Princes of Wales. It was also Edward I who started the tradition of naming his heir the Prince of Wales. Of course the English monarch is still the overlord of Wales, so the title doesn't confer real power.

While I won't deny that I know some people in your situation who have had a negative experience with these assessments, I also know a few who found it wasn't as bad as they had feared. 

You mentioned that you are working with a therapist, do you have an appointment scheduled with them between now and your assessment? If so I suggest discussing this with your therapist, ask them if you can use the session to explore some strategies for managing your anxiety on the day of your assessment. If you don't have an appointment scheduled between now and then, ring up and ask if it can be brought forward or if you can have a chat over the phone. 

Is there a friend or relative who can go with you to the assessment for moral support?  They don't have to be in the room during the actual appointment if that doesn't feel comfortable for you but just knowing there is a friendly face waiting outside might be helpful. 

Make sure you emphasise to your assessor how your condition impacts on your daily functioning, your concentration and your ability to interact with others. Most reasonable people know that just because someone has the odd ""good day"" that doesn't mean they can necessarily commit to paid employment. However, don't assume your assessor will see it that way. There is nothing wrong or deceitful about answering their questions based on how you function on a ""bad day"". You know you're not ready to go back to work, you're doctor knows you're not ready, you're therapist knows you're not ready. That should be enough but sadly it isn't. As a mental health nurse I have helped many people fill in forms to claim benefits or filled in the forms on thier behalf over the years and I knew that I sometimes had to emphasise that persons difficulties and play down their strengths in order to ensure they received the support they needed. That may sound dishonest but I don't believe it was. I knew that person wasn't capable of working at that time because I had gotten to know them as an individual, I could empathise with them and understand their daily struggles but I knew the people making the decisions didn't have that insight.

A bit of weed might make you slap happy or giggly, or it might make you go dizzy and puke; some of the hallucinogenics are orders of magnitude more intense and a wise head to help guide you and guard you the first time or two is essential. The payoff is that psychedelics can be a profoundly positive experience, so it's worth doing your homework first. Allegedly. I wouldn't know myself. Nuh-uh.

&gt;The Lib Dems have dropped almost 75 per cent in the polls since 2010. There's an election in less than a year. People have clearly not forgotten. Why would you vote for somebody who lies in such an incredibly public fashion? Either they're stupid or really don't care about their election pledges.

People have forgiven Labour for iraq. Nearly a decade long land war in asia started on completely false pretenses, no one mentions it anymore in regards to them...

Peoples memory regularly extends beyond a parliament. 

People won't let the tution fee's go, because the media and commedians constantly bring it up. Becuase meaningful political analysis hard. They have also largely allowed the conservatives to claim credit or don't mention the tax bracket changes for example. Likewise gay marridge, is an entirely conservative thing not coalition etc. 

Furthermore the reasonnig that 'well a junior coalition partner massive compramises were necessary', is a anethema to a lot of people who are so politically naive they thing students accumilating less (not no) debt and not having a functioning goverment would have been preferable. 

It's disapointing, lib dems will looes 10 to 15 seats next election. But it doesn't relaly matter liberalism is going no where and we will see what the historical view is

Honeslty these days, the only real employement advantage non-technical degree's will get you is a change to enter into the RNG graduate scheme. Beyond that, it's not that helpful.

And the societal thing is a hopelessly broken relic of the old class system. Everyone wants to be middle class, can't be middle class without a degree. Therefore, get degree even if degree does not equip with any particularly useful skills. 

What actual tangible benefits it affords though, in extending universal education by 3 years for what 40~% of people?

That argument is just not made. People keep talking as if it was akin to literacy. I would argue we've broken a system designed to train specialists and produce research into a convener belt of producing largely irrelevant qualifications.

And that degree inflation exists (which is certainly does) hardly seems to justify dumping vast amounts of societies resources on continuing the system.

&gt;Personally I'm not a fan of league tables when it comes to education (at a university or even high school level) because it means the actual education itself can suffer in order to make the institution look better.

Is there inequality toward's women today?, you bet.  Do I, as a ""cis white male"" think it's right? of course not.  Real feminists go fight the issues that actually hurt women the most in the real world, like domestic abuse, rape, religious doctrines/customs that keep women as accessories to men, sex trades, etc.  Fighting sexy girls in gaming, cosplay and there being an unequal amount of female writers in Doctor Who is not what affects women today form being seen as the real equals in society they should be.

Look at the terrible arranged marriage situation that still plagues Indian women.  

Real feminist: Fight this obvious and REAL misogyny towards women.

Tumblr feminists:  Would call me a ""shitlord"" for questioning a non white culture and focus on things like ""Look at Samus Aran... she's got boots..that's misogyny!!""

Tumblr feminists are an insult to victims of real misogyny/rape/inequality and try to bring up misogyny issues when there aren't any thus sullying the strides real feminists have done for years to bring gender equality to light.  A fight that is still going on but being dragged down by weird ""other-kin"" tumblrinas who hardly know what they are talking about and the SJW guys who defend them for the sake of notoriety and narcism as oppose to actual positive change in gender equality.

I apologize for my ""hambeast"" comment, that was wrong of me to say.

I'm white. I don't feel sorry for being white because that's not what the point is. The point is to recognize that as someone who is white I have advantages that people who are not white do not have.

So don't feel sorry for being white. But you should feel sorry for you lack of ability to empathize with the struggles of those who are not white or male or straight.

This comment is confusing because you seem to have this kind of either-or approach to feminism. Like... you can care about domestic violence AND the sexualization of women in gaming at the same time? How is this mutually exclusive? It's possible to care about more than one thing at a time and recognize how multiple things are damaging to women.

My experience comes from working in regions of the world (North, Central Africa and the Middle East) where kidnapping is seen as an illegal but fairly normal business transaction.  Someone gets taken, negotiations are made, a ransom agreed and paid and the kidnappie gets released.  

In the west this is some what frowned upon and often a ransom gets paid but in secret.  Unfortunately the UK takes the opposite stance and never negotiates or gives in to demands - and someone generally dies.   

In 2009, two Swiss, a German and a Brit got taken in Mali by a local war lord whilst on holiday.  It is believed that a ransom of about EU 600k was paid by the Swiss and the Germans for each of their subjects, but not by the British who refused to negotiate. The other 3 were released unharmed and our government signed a death warrant for Edwin Dyer, who was subsequently executed by his captors.  The thing to remember here is that there was no weird religious shit going down or anything, no political prisoners were to be released (although sometimes in this area of the world that's a motivator too), It was business pure and simple.

Because the UK will not negotiate, the chance of now being shot out of hand if your taken is high.  Because the UK will not negotiate later on, your going to die, if not immediately, then later on when its discovered your a worthless burden.  If your British, your fucked.  

If the UK did negotiate like France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Spain and Italy - they would be seen to (some extent) be supporting what ever organisation is involved - but, as seen time and time again in N.Africa over the last 10 years, you will probably be OK.

On a world stage, where increasingly terrorist organisations are the kidnappers that blur  the line between kidnapping and hostage taking, who the hell wants to be seen to support them?  Attitudes to ransom demands in N. Africa have changed since the Libyan fuck up and only a few kidnappings (of mainly French citizens) have resulted in payments.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.
So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

I read that they are trying to save face and know that those people they are connected with would look down on them for what happened. 'She was kidnapped' means more sympathy than blame goes there way.

One of the detectives wrote a book which was then banned, claiming Maddy fell from the back of a sofa, hit her head and died and they came up with the kidnapping story to cover up their even deeper negligence. They claimed she was taken out of an open window, but when cops arrive the window is closed, there's a shutter on the outside that can only be operated from inside their apartment, and the sofa in question is pushed up against the wall with blood (detected by dogs) found on the window and on the floor. They told cops that when Kate went to check on them, the window was open and opening the bedroom door caused a draft, and that the curtains were blowing freely in the wind - not possible with the sofa pushed back against the wall and pinning the curtains, plus the fact that the shutter was down.

Their story doesn't hold up and as far as I know, the theories are they covered up an accident.

I think everyone here is suffering from memory loss. Barca is their heyday under Pepe would keep the ball for 80% of the game. With the other 20%, if the opposition could muster maybe 3 attacks on goal, they'd get AT LEAST 1 goal.

Thats Valdes.

Remember the CL semi vs Chelsea 3 years ago? Barca completely dominated. Chelsea had a 3 chances, and scored nearly every time.

I have NEVER seen Valdes contribute to a great side the way I saw Grobbs, Schmeichal, Van de Saar, Kahn, Casillas (in his prime) etc do. Great sides still need a top keeper to pull a match out of the bag whenever they were below par.

Valdes is considered great simply because of the medals he has. Achieved mainly by a team who hardly let the opposition have the ball, so they couldn't punish Barca's defence adequately enough. And whenever Valdes picked the ball out the back of his own net, commentators and pundits would always bemoan the weak defence.

Never the goalie. Because, with that many medals, he must be great. Right?

Circular logic.

Put Valdes in the Premier League for a month, and you'll all be screaming for Migs to come back (squeaky distribution and all).

All this talk of ""yeah, he's a great shot stopper, but ..."" is a load of bull. Everything else a goalie does ... EVERYTHING ELSE ... is less important than shot stopping. A great save is exactly equal to scoring a goal. Period. And thats the single MOST important thing in footy. Everything else is gravy.

Its like taking a striker who isn't the fastest, and whose pass completion ratio is 50%. And who strays offside 50% of the time. And can't shoot outside of 20 yards.

But who still, somehow, by natural sixth sense, ends up in the right place at the right time and absolutely buries 75% of all his chances with first time shots inside the box.

That gimp is still worth his weight in gold to any footie team who wants to win. Think of Inzaghi, et al.

Same with keepers like Migs, I reckon. Sure, we can get better. But until you find someone who can at least match his ability to save certain goals (ie: score one for Liverpool), then I don't give a stuff for all the other reputed abilities.

PS: 1 other thing. Migs is still quite young for a keeper. He has room to improve. Grobbs was shaky as hell for the first year and a half at Anfield.

I know it's purely subjective, which is why I brought in sales.

Yeah but there's a big difference in Call of Duty and BF compared to Assassins Creed and Assassins Creed changes every year, in the past Xbox has had the exclusive content it's purely who want's to pay more that year. Destiny, again is nowhere near as big and despite being a good game the reality of it is that it flopped in comparison to the hype it recieved.

Honestly, what game compares to Halo? CoD and BF are obviously more popular because they're on all platforms and easy to play and there is literally no PS3/4 FPS that comes close anybody looking at it from an unbiased point of view knows that. All you have to do is play Forza and it will completely ruin your GT experience.

I'm not saying PS4 doesn't have exclusives, just not many worth mentioning, especially since the likes of MGS came to Xbox too. Indie games? Really? Who cares about indie games when choosing a console? That's like buying a PC for flash games.

What wouldn't surprise me in the least is if they're getting all their writers through some old boys club of men-know-men, with no-one bothering to find it odd that they haven't been had a female sci-fi writer for a good six years.

If you just do a quick wiki look, you'll find that in fact in the entirety of New Who out of the dozens of writers there's only been *one* woman writer: [Helen Raynor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Raynor), who wrote  ""Daleks in Manhattan""/""Evolution of the Daleks"" and ""The Sontaran Stratagem""/""The Poison Sky"".

If you're saying it's all about quality, then apparently there's only one woman screenwriter in the whole of Great Britain who's good enough to write for Doctor Who? If so, I'd still find myself siding with Neil that that isn't right, and we should be asking what it is about sci-fi writing that apparently stops women from wanting to write in the genre.

Plurality of experience. Shakespeare never went to any of the places he wrote about, yet he sits upon the pinnacle of English literature. That's what writing is, empathising and imagining characters.

Poor thing.

&gt;What you are basically saying is that, because I'm not Black, Hispanic, or whatever, that means that there is something wrong with me

That's not what I'm saying in the slightest.  I'm saying white culture has symptoms of a problem that's been brewing for hundreds and hundreds of years.  It affects pretty much all whites.  It doesn't necessarily make them bigots (it *can*), but the problems are there.

When Iron Man came out, a bunch of my friends asked why Nick Fury was cast as Samuel L. Jackson.  He's white in the comic, so why is he black in the movie?  This kind of question is a symptom of a problem, because when a white actor is cast, white people don't think anything of it, but when a black actor is cast, there has to be a reason.

&gt;and no matter how many times I try to say I don't have those prejudices and biases, there is still something inherently racist about me because of the color of my skin. That, my friend, is racist. Being judged because of my race, or skin color.

I never once said you're racist or that anything is wrong with you, and I am certainly not judging you.  I don't even know you.

I'm saying that the idea that people should just see people as people regardless of race is inherently wrong because only white people have the privilege of pretending race isn't an issue.  A black person is reminded on a daily basis that they're black.  A woman is reminded on a daily basis that she's a woman.

Everyone rather fairly acknowledges that Chelsea would've won the title last season if they'd had a striker of Diego Costa's prowess then.  You say Man City spread the goals around, but Toure scored 20 in the league, which is an amazing achievement for a CM, and without that, they wouldn't have won the league.  And even still, part of the reason their goals were spread amongst strikers is because Aguero was injured for so long... he's a guaranteed 20+ striker otherwise.  Plus, we don't have anyone of the quality of Aguero, Negredo, Dzeko or Silva in our side.  Would Everton have finished above us without Lukaku?

You can definitely succeed without a scoring focal point in your side, but it's much harder, particularly for teams outside the traditional big four, who generally don't have quite as much quality spread throughout the entire squad.

Chadli, Lamela and Eriksen might all get 15-20 G+A like you say, but our attack is mercifully thin.  I could just as easily presuppose that Lamela succumbs to a similar back injury to the one that kept him out for so long last year, and Eriksen gets crocked in a terrible tackle.  Who's gonna take up the slack then?  We don't have the kinds of players to step up and take over should the form or fitness in any of our front four players dip.

The issue is that the showrunners have only been indulging in one area of good writers - men. Specifically, men who mostly share their boyish and extremely romantic view of the Doctor. Sure, that's their prerogative. It's their show.

That and it pretends to be this progressive relationship, but Vastra still treats Jenny like any Victorian husbands treated their wives, and that is not progress. 

It's just that it is sort of understandable for people to fall in love with the Doctor.  I mean, this isn't just some random guy that makes women swoon over him in spite of themselves.  He is an incredibly intelligent, experienced, brave, charismatic, time travelling alien that takes them on impossible adventures.  While I do appreciate when the companion isn't in love with the Doctor, I don't blame them when they are.  Not only is he whisking them off in his snog box, but then he is putting them in adrenaline-charged situations.  And they are, after all, human, those kind of emotional, hormonal moments are bound to make one confused about her feelings.

Edit: Also, I would add that I am not sure we can say it is uncharacteristic for young women to fall in love with the Doctor under these circumstances.  Honestly, all of the women who have fallen in love with him have been teenagers or in their twenties.

I was being a bit facetious about the bankrupt part. But what is useless to you can be the most important part of somebody else's life. In some sense, it's about perspective. What free tuition addresses is the equality of access to higher education and the creation of a highly educated and skilled work force.

By having fees you disincentivate people to go to higher education especially when others around them don't follow that route. You might argue that's a good thing but I disagree. If the courses really are useless then it's up to the universities to stop offering them. By forcing £9000 fees, universities effectively benefit from (one might even say need to) having more undergraduates in as many courses as possible.

I just don't think fees are viable in the long term and they will just increase to match that discrepancy leading to a US style education. Higher education needs reform. But giving advantage to those with more oppurtunities (and more educated parents) ends up being counter productive.

&gt;How on earth is it the greater good to fund a bunch of teenagers drinking habits for 3 years while doing a useless degree? That seems the exact opposite of the greater good.

Stereotypes aside, we shouldn't offer education (even, incentivate it) because some people might not make the most of it? I think you are the one being dramatic now. Doing something like philosophy may seem useless to you but if you talk to somebody that's done it, it might have changed their life. Again, perspective. Education should be open to all, irrespective of background.

Some people are not. For example people who are in jail for possession of home grown marijuana, voluntary prostitutes who breach ASBOs for soliciting money for sex or people who merely possess illegal (adult) pornography that was safely and legally produced. All of these carry a jail sentence of varying lengths and none of them have any real victims but none of them have the vote in prison. 

Also people in prison for only a year or two have not committed a serious offence and the vast vast majority of them will not have committed a crime which would impact their electoral judgement. They are just as capable of voting before jail as in jail as after they are released. The only reason you might have for not letting someone vote is if you feel it contributes to the punishment element of imprisonment or the rehabilitation element. It does potentially contribute to punishment but not a huge amount while it has an extremely adverse effect on rehabilitation. It alienates prisoners from civil society and encourages them to ignore politics and not to make an investment in the future of the country which will increase recidivism. Plus the punishment is not related to the crime so is unlikely to get a message across. It's like convicting someone of fraud and punishing them by banning them from driving. Unless the punishment is linked to the wrongdoing it just looks like mere revenge for the sake of revenge. 

Also we restrict people's right to freedom when they commit a crime and we imprison them. Some we restrict forever others only a short while. Some we sent to open prisons and others we don't even send to prison and control their freedoms in other ways on probation etc. Yet every prisoner has their vote totally taken away for the duration of their sentence. Why not vary the voting right depending on sentence. People in open prisons and those with &lt;1 year non-violent convictions can vote. Those with &gt;1 year &lt;2 years non-violent convictions can vote in local but not general elections and all violent offenders + those over 2 years cannot vote at all. That would comply with the ECHR ruling and hopefully not make poor David Cameron egest his breakfast too violently.

Scotland does inordinately well out of the Barnett formula. Despite being one of the richer areas of the UK, public spending per head there comes to £10,152, the second highest of any UK nation or region (coming in after Northern Ireland at £10,876). For comparison, the figure is £9,709 in Wales and £8,529 in England.

The Barnett formula is a blunt instrument that doles out money based on population and the level of public spending in England. If that were to be replaced with a needs-based formula, the Scottish Government would see a significant cut in their overall budget, while the Welsh Government would see a more modest increase. 

Consequentially, reforming Barnett would be one of the most politically toxic things the government could do vis-à-vis Scotland. Wales has none of the leverage or influence within the UK that Scotland does, and so the calls by government and civil society here for fairness fall on deaf ears.

That, coupled with the previous evidence that there are some terrible writers who keep writing for Doctor Who and just happen to be good friends of Moffat (plus Moffat's own comments regarding women), appears to suggest that yes there is something related to sex that is in play here.

The other thing that has been suggested is that, since women make up the majority of the population, it is incredibly improbable that there has not been a woman capable of writing good episodes for the show for 6 years.

I do not suggest that there is a concious effort to keep women out, but rather an unconcious preference for men.

Much though I'd love for him to get swept into the ash heap of history where he belongs, UKIP have been polling too well for too long to allow any kind of televised debate worth its salt to take place without him. 

I don't like televised debates. At all. They're a horrible distraction from the wider campaign, lead to uneven coverage for third/fourth parties, and make things out to be substantially more presidential than they actually are. But since they're apparently here to stay, thanks to the idiotic decision to start a tradition last time around, we might as well do them right. 

That means, alas, letting Farage in. Even beside the fact that it's a matter of democracy at this point, given how well the party's been doing, the headlines that'd inevitably accompany a debate sans Farage would be a gift from God to UKIP's publicity machine- the headliens would practically write themselves.

It's going to end up happening, whether Cameron/Clegg/Miliband like it or not. And, given Clegg's staggering ineptitude *on his home turf* in that EU debate, the prospect worries me considerably. Cameron's the only one of the three main leaders that I expect'd be capable of dealing with Farage head-on- the other two are too desperate to avoid touching awkward subjects to come out of a debate well. 

*That said*- the Greens won't make it into any debates. They could poll at 10% and still not have a hope in hell of winning more than a tiny handful of seats- they'll have a heavy job holdling onto Brighton Pavillion as it is. Bennett and Lucas can be safely ignored- the reason the Lib Dems are still ""relevant"" is that their local vote in safe seats, even if worst comes to worst, is strong enough to carry them to ~20 MPs, even now.

Worst thing I've seen: 
Picture this - A friend of mine from Ireland, who I met at university, coming to his first game with me. West Ham away in 2006. We won 1-0 thanks to a late DaMarcus Beasley winner. After the goal went in, we were going absolutely crazy celebrating and my mate suddenly shouts, I turn to look at him and his hair is all wet. There's a stream of piss coming from above. A West Ham fan in the tier above us had intentionally pissed on his head.  

Worst away experience: 
Bizarrely, Ajax in the Champions League in October 2012. It's a shame because it was a great trip, for obvious reasons large numbers of our fans were even more intoxicated than usual, everyone was having great fun hanging out in the red light district before the game, singing beside the canals etc. Firstly, a bunch of Ajax fans randomly attacked us, just ran at us down one of the canals and started laying into people. The police arrived and it was over quite quickly but it wasn't nice and a couple of us got hurt.

When we got to the ground, there was a huge queue outside and not enough turnstiles open for everyone to get in, this was about 30 mins before kick off. Basically a bunch of blues who didn't have tickets had just showed up to try their luck. Eventually, not knowing what to do, the stadium staff opened a gate because those at the front were getting a bit crushed and they knew that there were people with actual tickets in that queue. Once they opened the gate, it created a rush and tons of ticketless fans got in, a few people got a bit trampled. My dad (who is 70 this year so I was trying to look after him) made the point that they were pretty close to having something Hillsborough-esque on their hands. 

Once inside the ground, I got up to the entrance if our enclosure and realised that there were far more fans in the away end than had tickets. Near my seat people were standing in the aisles, all crushed up against each other, it was just massively unsafe. If anything had happened it would have been big trouble because there were far too many of us and several flights of stairs between us and the exit to the street. I was amazed they'd let something like that happen at what is a reasonably modern stadium, but there you go. It wasn't great.

Edit: To clarify why, typically people working in research for universities (at the level of post-graduates) get paid very little relative to the Doctors/Surgeons (£30-40,000 would be a salary range in STEM fields for the top universities), however their Visa requirements have them competing with people on much higher salaries for whatever number the government has set on highly-skilled immigrants for that year.

For PhD's for non-EU countries it is also pretty difficult as their is a significant fee for the Visa (which they may have to cover from their stipend that is just enough for living costs), as well as higher fees. So generally only PhD students that come with significant funding from national governments or companies can afford it. These deals often come with agreements that the students then have to return work in universities in their country of origin or for the companies for a significant period of time (often 10 years). So we don't even get that much longterm benefit from these students.

Timetabling (more intensive  than you'd think when you're trying to fit a few thousand people into a couple of hundred rooms - this is more than one person job)

Then the University balances money between each department so all students pay towards costs like training a medical student (£250,000 per student), costs in mechanical engineering and physics where a single piece of kit can run well in excess of a million, chemicals and other supplies and so on. This model made more sense when fees were mainly paid by the UK Government as obviously they wanted to encourage a broad range of subjects be taught.

At a department level, assuming you have 100 students that's only £900,000 - a single prof will easily run well in excess of 100k a year when you include things like pension and NI and for a decent professor this is a low, low rate. Trust me when I say that most academics in the sciences could make double their uni pay in industry. 

Then there is a whole bunch of work you don't see up front like setting coursework (easy), marking it (takes for ever), running the online material of the module (surprisingly hard), teaching away days, rewriting the courses when necessary (way more common than people think as well) and exam invigilation.

Then there's the stuff you'll never encounter in the normal running of a course like adaptive coursework for students with disabilities, running open days, advertising the course over seas to attract foreign students, insurance (lots), running plagiarism checks, disciplinary hearings for unfair practice, board of studies meetings (each student's progress is reviewed each year by at least 10 members of staff, takes forever), module moderation, examiners meetings, external examiners meetings, you acting as external for other Universities courses,  senate meetings, second marking (double the marking work load), home office visa issuing compliance activities (ball ache), handling legal challenges (not usually a big issue but when it is it's massive as you have to compile everything the student submitted and review it and the problem is growing).

The multiply everything above by 1.5 for each masters course your uni runs as they carry 60 extra credits as well.

Anyway, I'd say yes **IF** they did it right. It'd have to be done in a way that isn't under exaggerated - I mean, c'mon, he's never regened into a female before - but not to the point of over exaggeration. And the actor has to be a good one. I mean, this is the Doctor here, the one true staple throughout the show. He, or err, she, would have to have the same amount of personality change as the other Doctors. That's to say, not really manly or womanly, but kinda just Doctor-y. The issue is that, if they don't do, people call them unfair and sexist. If they do do it, then people say it was just for publicity and to appease the female viewers. 


So ultimately, I think they can, and should do it, as long as the Doctor doesn't change. They have to treat like a normal Doctor regeneration for it work. If they focus too much on it, it won't work.

of 51% of the population, you really think that there would be this high dissparity? Many men don't think they're capable of getting that much success. Even if I said this argument was true, what would cause women to not think they're capable of reaching such heights other than sexism?

This is a red herring, but an interesting one. Shakespeare just ""happens"" to be a major part of our literature. I could in fact make feminist literary critiques of Shakespeare (which there is an entire subset of books devoted to), but that's not the issue. No one cares that one person wrote a lot of books and got famous, and we pay a lot of attention to them in schools, we also pay a lot of attention to Mary Shelley, and Jane Austen, etc. The issue is, in 2014, on a show that regularly changes writers, this like many others has a staff that doesn't come anywhere close to demograpics of society. To push it further, this is the case in MANY institutions and seats of power. Were there not barriers explicit or otherwise to impede the progress of certain members of society, this would not be the overall pattern.

&gt; Also the the statement implies I only like the show because it's written by white men. 

Not the point of what I said at all. Just said, it's never women or minority that make the claim "" I don't care who the show is written by"" and it's not a coincidence that the people writing the show look nothing like them. 

&gt;Finally saying I should ""get real"", as if the inherent sexism is so obvious that any fool can see it is laughable

Traditional Sherbet Recipe

* Take a mixing bowl and add one pound of the finest ground sugar you have to it. Icing sugar is best but also the most effort    
* Add a couple of tablespoons of bicarbonate of soda and mix well.  
* For the next stage, you can either add in powdered citric or tartaric acid to taste or add lemon juice to taste. If adding lemon juice, do so a few drops at a time whilst mixing with a wooden spoon as this will break up the icing past as it tries to form.  
* Mix well to ensure proper distribution of the acids.  
* If you used powdered acid, now is the time to add a concentrated flavouring such as lemon extract. If the flavouring is significantly more viscous than water, dilute it a little. Add it in the same manner as lemon juice.  
* Take a food colouring and add by the method given for lemon juice until you reach a colour that doesn't resemble anything illegal.

Add one or two tablespoons to a glass of water on hot days for a lovely fizzy drink, dip wetted sweets into it to coat them, or just eat the sherbet by itself. 

Please do not snort it or eat it by the spoonful.

Well, I knew when I started the piece so early into his run that I chanced it not actually being his catchphrase, but either way, I loved the episode, so I don't regret it.  If it does turn out that ""Shut up!"" or ""Question, ____"" ends up being his thing, it just gives me another chance to draw him.

Although, I hope it isn't ""Shut up!"".  I know it is in line with his new personality, but I think silencing the voices of others is fundamentally in opposition to the Doctor's overall character.  I don't mind him throwing it out here and there, but I don't like the idea that his new defining feature might be just callous rudeness.  

Also, just been thinking about it, but do you guys feel that an in story reason for his new brusque/frank demeanor might be from spending so much time in Christmas?  I mean, if you live somewhere where lying is impossible for many, many years, isn't there a chance that after awhile you would stop censoring yourself altogether?

false,pottyaboutpotter1,rory,Rory,"Look. It doesn't matter if you're male or female. Gay or straight. Can you write a good Doctor Who episode? Moffat goes through several scripts a series. He has a large group of writers to write episodes. He then chooses the ones that are the best/fit in with the series/easiest to produce as they're on a budget. You're all very quick to slam Moffat for not havign any female writers, but have you considered that maybe, he has and their scripts were rejected for not being in line with the tone of the series or simply being too expensive to produce? An episode by Stephen Fry got rejected simply because it would have been too expensive to make. Doctor Who runs on a TV budget. Sometimes stuff has to go. And maybe a female writer wrote a script that would have eaten away at the budget and taken money Moffat would rather spend on other episodes? Or quite possibly no female writers have shown an interest in writing for the series? Maybe they all declined? Maybe they were all busy? Maybe Moffat is more concerned with getting the right writer for the job and no female writers were right for it? Just like Moffat would not cast a female Doctor just to have a female Doctor, he won't hire a female writer for a female writer's sake. He'll only hire someone who's the right person for the job. Honestly, most of you think Moffat sits in his office thinking ""How can I oppress women and be sexist today?"" but really he's just a guy doing his job trying to make the best Doctor Who possible.

Right I have bit my tounge  and even defended you at times but no more.

you come on this subreddit argue a view (which is your right) and state its great but then im reminded that you have never been here (from your own mouth) so   lit up im not blinded by supporting one side which wont affect me because im not all cosy in England if crap hits the fan.  Id rather take views from /u/junglistmassive or whomever because they actually live here and the decisions this assembly makes will affect us not you. Your not victimized here your someone who holds view points and spouts them off as perfect while never having to face the effects (positive or negative) they may have on the people who live here.

You get downvoted because of that I respect the hell out of the nationalist leaning redditors here because they live here and know what im going through because I live here as well. In general you are downvoted because you never will have to face the effects of a result. No you can just watch it on bbc news and then complain on here.

So I respect the nationalist leaning guys on here because they live here they don't live in England and turn issues that affect people like me into a point scoring contest.  I want you to post on this subreddit you give interesting views but boy do you sure stir the pot. As far as im concerned you have became the nationalist version of /u/dontthrowstones on this subreddit.

Maybe think on this. I don't care that you want a United ireland nor do I care that you want whatever unlimited rice pudding for all I know. I think you have become a caricature of yourself. 

Get back to making decent points without trying to turn everything into a crap throwing contest.

And im not gonna down vote you. Your point was correct it was the tone and the manner of your recent comments that have annoyed me of late.

If I may be a pedant—the slide in ratings (I assume you mean the 'overnight' ratings) doesn't really mean anything, since many more people watch using time shift services like iPlayer. They can count ratings for the following 30 days using iPlayer but they can't begin to count the myriad other catch-up/DVR services, let alone the number of people watching in other countries and illegally using pirated copies. If anything, *Who*'s viewership has *in*creased over the last five years, since BBC Worldwide started to make a big push in marketing it internationally.

Not disputing that there's a problem with female representation. The number of women who have written *Who* stories for TV over the last fifty-one years can be counted on one hand:

* Barbara Clegg (*Enlightenment*)
* Jane Baker (with Pip Baker: *Mark of the Rani, Terror of the Vervoids, The Ultimate Foe, Time and the Rani*)
* Rona Munro (*Survival*)
* Helen Raynor (*Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks, The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky*)

So there is a problem. There is a very big problem across the TV industry—dare I say it, especially in speculative fiction—with women being under-represented in writers' positions. There needs to be a concerted effort from all parties to fix it—from the script editing and production teams to the processes that get writers into the industry in the first place.

Based in northwest [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), the [rulers of Gwynedd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Gwynedd) repeatedly rose to preeminence and were acclaimed as ""[King of the Britons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Britons)"" before losing their power in civil wars or invasions. The unitary kingdom of the usurper [Gruffydd ap Llywelyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruffydd_ap_Llywelyn) was shattered by a [Saxon invasion in 1063](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_invasion_of_Wales) just prior to the arrival of the [Normans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Wales), but the [traditional dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Aberffraw) restored by [Gruffudd ap Cynan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruffudd_ap_Cynan) slowly recovered until [Llywelyn the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great) of Gwynedd was able to proclaim the [Principality of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Wales) at [Aberdyfi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Aberdyfi) in 1216. That realm lasted until the [invasions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Wales_by_Edward_I) of [Edward I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England) in 1283.

Whilst it may not be obvious that gender biases are directly harmful, they could be doing things such as suppressing productivity (ie. over the period of time that more women have been entering the workplace there has been significant increase in productivity). It might also enable a better understanding between the two genders if culture can be influenced by both.

My point is that there are people who believe this to be a problem, so why not try it? If it does harm to the industry the ideas will be very quickly dumped, but we simply do not know if it will or won't.

The important bit is:
&gt; As it happened, most of the guys went first. Typical stuff— some stuff was good, some stuff needed work, etc. etc. Then one of the female writers went, and she brought up an issue. A big issue. It had to do with a sexual situation in the plot, which she explained could easily be interpreted as a form of rape.

&gt;It wasn’t intended that way. In fact, the writer of the plot was mortified. The intention was that it come across as creepy and subverting… but authorial intention is often irrelevant, and we must always consider how what we write will be interpreted. In this case, it was not a long trip for the person playing through the plot to see what was happening at a slightly different angle, and it was no longer good-creepy. It was bad-creepy. It was discomforting and not cool at all. And this female writer was not alone. All the other women at the table nodded their heads, and had noted the same thing in their critiques. So we discussed it, changes were made, and everything was better. Crisis averted.

&gt;All good, right? That’s what these reviews are for.

&gt;Here’s the thing: after the meeting was over, it struck me how sharply divided the reviewers were on gender lines. The guys involved, all reasonable and liberal-minded fellows I assure you (including me!) all automatically took the intended viewpoint of the author and didn’t see the issue. The girls had all taken the other side of the encounter, and saw it completely differently— all of them. As soon as it was pointed out, it was obvious… but why hadn’t we seen it?

&gt;And this thought occurred as well: if this had been a team with no female perspective present, it would have gone into the game that way. Had that female writer been the lone woman, would her view have been disregarded as an over-reaction? A lone outlier? How often does that happen on game development teams, ones made up of otherwise intelligent and liberal guys who are then shocked to find out that they inadvertently offended a group that is quickly approaching half of the gaming audience?

OK, what specifically are they doing wrong?  Apparently the answer is nothing.

So we are hypothetically going to demand that they change what?  Are we going to demand that they no longer hire the writers whose material is what the producers feel is the best fit? Are we going to demand that they hire female writers regardless of whether the producers feel that a given writer's material is a good fit for the show?

Because if we are demanding those things then we should have evidence that they have done something wrong.  And if we have no evidence that they have done something wrong, then it's none of our business how they run their show.

I find these suggestions interesting to read personally, but if we're talking about songs that are catching on then you've got to be thinking of the people who are actually going to be at the game singing it, not the heavily American and 18-25yo demographic that makes up most people on here.

That is completely your opinion, just because you don't enjoy the writing means they should stretch out and hire female writers just because they're female.

That would be counter productive. A woman's possibly mediocre story could be chosen over a mans terrific story just because the BBC are being told to reach a gender quota. I say hire a writer based on the strength of their writing, not their gender. I'd love to see more women writers for the show, but they need to have the stories to match.

Im 23 and I've been commuting 30 miles for the last 6 years, 5 years of that was on a naked 600 bandit, which was cheap and fun at first for first few years. But eventually the motorway boredom,  british weather and wear and tear on the bike can take its toll. Eventually for me riding the bike to work was just not fun being cold and tiring but the worst thing was that it made me lose the amazing smile factor when I went out on weekend rides with my friends and family. Riding a motorbike became a chore. Which is something I never want to experience again.

It pretty much came to an end around january 2013 where I travelled all the way to through thick frost and snow only to make it to the car park and drop the bike on the smallest ice puddle. Aswell as having to bump start the bike every other day as the cold kills batteries.

After throwing several tamptrums, I decided enough is enough, I wanted a car, I passed my test shortly after and bought my first car a 2003 Subaru Impreza for 1175 and insured it for 1250. It makes commuting a hell of alot easier, and for me actually quicker as you can jump straight in, instead of spending 15mins getting my gear sorted getting the bike unlocked and out the garage.
But he best and most important thing for me was when I went out with family/friends on the weekend or a sunny day it made bikes amazingly fun again. 

Tldr: Constant commuting drains the fun out of bikes. Get a car and be a fair weather rider.

Really it depends on what you liike:

You are ok with campiness and bad cgi, you like show's that have interesting concepts a lot of heart: start with 2005 reboot with the 9th Doctor

You want something light and fun but a little bit cerebral: Start at season 5 of the reboot with the 11th Doctor

You don't have time for option 1 or you don't like the first episode of season 5: Start at this season, this is season 8 and the first episode is Deep Breath. Brand new Doctor and a big shift in tone from the previous incarnation.

EDIT: I should probably elaborate a little on why I love it while you think it over, it's mainly the vulnerability that Sherlock displays in that story after he's seen the hound. Cumberbatch does such an incredible job portraying the complete mental breakdown that this super genius is having after witnessing something that can't be real but seems to be, and it's even more powerful and makes so much more sense when you realise that the whole thing is an intense hallucination, as hallucinogenics often make people very emotional and Benedict sells it so bloody well. 

And it's a great reworking of one of the most famous Sherlock Holmes stories, and the direction's great, the mysteries well done, the whole thing about Sherlock quitting cigarettes is fun, it's just a really well rounded Sherlock episode.

false,courtenayplacedrinks,null,null,"Once you see it it's blindingly obvious: we don't know the character's motivations.

Story writing 101 is about giving your characters something they want. This the source of all the dramatic tension, it makes you sympathise with the character and wraps you up in the story because you want to see them succeed.

Doctor Who episodes are usually mysteries, and they have always played to some extent on the idea that Doctor himself is an enigma. For this reason the show has relied heavily on the companions to do all the reacting, building the tension and pushing our Force of Nature in the right direction.

For whatever reason Clara isn't painted like this. She's calm and unreactive most of the time. When she does react she's even less predictable than the doctor. (She's prone to fits of emotion that appear to come out of nowhere—""OMG my boyfriend's old!"") It's left to lightly sketched background characters with little screen time to flag to us that we're in peril or push the major characters towards resolving the plot.

The assumption I guess is that the plot speaks for itself. Clara and the Doctor should feel threatened by the cyborgs or the moon spiders because they are inherently scary and they have killed people. The problem is that's not how fiction works. Fiction works by drawing you in to the characters and taking you on the same emotional journey they're going through. If your main characters are confident and unaffected—like the Doctor and Clara—then you're less invested in the story.

Clara is more of a plot device that a character. One of the recurring features of the latest seasons is what I call *deus ex Clara*: Clara does exactly what's needed at exactly the right time without any apparent motivation. We don't see her wrestling with what to do or figuring out the solution. She just acts and it saves the day.

There are particularly egregious cases where the Doctor develops a spontaneous personality flaw at just the wrong time and Clara steps in to do what the Doctor would normally do if it weren't for his sudden change of character.

All of this wouldn't be a problem if the personality changes and clever decisions were motivated. If this Doctor had been established as jealous of other hero figures then his behaviour around Robin Hood would make sense. If Clara had a trait of always doubting herself and asking the Doctor before making critical decisions then it would make sense for the Doctor to leave her with the nuclear button.

Next time you watch a Doctor Who epsiode count how many times you can reasonably ask ""why is the Doctor/Clara doing that?"" If their motivations don't make sense or you can only work them out retrospectively then—in many cases—it's just bad writing.

false,JoeSalmonGreen,null,null,"&gt; I've known plenty of Green activists. Throw a stick in any protest march under the sun and it'll hit fifty of them before it hits the ground. 

I know plenty of Greens who aren't that keen on marches, I think you'll also find that a lot of people who love big centralised marches feel that the Greens aren't radical enough and don't spend enough time banging on about Karl Marx and the means of production.

It's kinda like me saying, oh yeah I know metal fans, go to any beer festival and you'll meet a bunch and then saying that metal fans are all dead into craft ales. Local youth activists (whatever the fuck they are) and people who go on marches are just a tiny bit of the party, I think you'll find that when it comes to an academic look at economics the Greens run rings around the other parties.

Natalie Bennett has spoken at events hosted by the University in my city around economics far more often than all the figures from the mainstream parties combined. I think you'll also find the Greens are the only party that have any concrete plans around limitations to growth, GDP and economic inequality.

&gt; EU switching to 45% renewable power generation in the next 16 years and, in the same period, cutting overall energy usage by 40%, for example. 

Germany isn't far off that already, plus surely you've got to concede there are political impossibilities such as someone giving up their yearly cheap package holiday, and physical impossibilities such as us continuing to destroy the ecosystem and still, well existing. I think one is much more impossible than the other.

&gt; their stance on emissions reductions alongside a total opposition to nuclear energy are insane. 

I think you could probably convince me on this, there are some solid arguments in favor of nuclear, but then again once I speak to someone anti nuclear they'd convince me of the opposite. I'm no physicist. Membership is something like £3 a month, join up, draft a motion, change the policy if you really are so sure, I think it's going to be easier to get the Greens to go nuclear than to get any other party to go green.

&gt; (The Lib Dems) On policy and record, they're significantly better than (modern) Labour.

I used to think the Lib Dems were more to the left of Labour, that simply isn't the case though, they just seem to be an alternative option for people who don't like Labour or Tory, appearing to be whatever the voter wants. If you are a tory but don't think they are liberal enough, go lib dem. If you are a labour supporter but don't think they are left wing enough go lib dem, they have policies to convince you of each assessment. To me they still rely to much on private donations from rich individuals, plus the votes are delegate votes as far as I understand rather than membership votes, correct me if I'm wrong.

If they were against TTIP and PFI and supported Rail and Energy nationalization, reform of the NHS to undo it's marketisation, Ecological Tax Reform, a citizens income / reverse income tax / basic income I'd seriously consider supporting them, I'm pragmatic, ditto with Labour, fuck I'll vote for policy over personality or image any day. It's not happened yet though so Green it is.

What would it take for you to give up on the Lib Dems anyhow?

Whats a Great deal of policy as well? Has anybody looked at the parties manifestos before the election and seen how much they were able to actually do?

When I worked in a bar, there used to be this police officer about mid to late 30s who would always pay with a 50quid notes. Vodka and coke, 50 quid note. Another Vodka and coke, 50 quid note. Another vodka and coke, 50 quid note.. I thought he was trying to show off but someone told me he was bent and was trying to launder the money he got for turning a blind eye to local gangsters. But that was all he said, she said with no real proof.

Other police officers were dead on. I'm mates with a PSNI officer who jokes about getting in to the police because he was a catholic with a GCSE in art. He only got five Cs at GCSE which was enough to join the PSNI. He just wants to do his job and doesn't give a fuck about anything. 

Although once, I was running my brother from Randalstown down to Central station to get the last train to Dublin one Sunday night. They clocked me at 78 going down the motorway and got pulled over. Of course, I thought, honesty is the best policy, told them I knew I was speeding because I wanted to get my brother to central station which was enough for them to give me a talking to, going over in great length the dangers of speeding, why I shouldn't speed and did I know that the stopping distance at 78 is 10% more than the stopping distance at 70.

I think one part is the audience. More men than women, which means fewer women are interersted in being associated with the show. There are men who grew up with the show and dream of being in it. Just look at Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi. Long time fans make good contributors to the show. I'm positive there are women interested in Doctor Who, but how many are so into the show that they really want to be on it or in it? 

That's a question to which I have no good answer. I think the companions have been better done recently, and I very much prefer Moffat's Who to Davis'. Davis' had fewer hits, but fewer misses. My trouble is that the misses were fucking awful and the hits were only pretty good. Moffat's have been the opposite. The highs are fantastic and the lows are just below acceptable. 

Does the show need more female writers? Sure couldn't hurt. Davis' built a great foundation, but Moffat is doing the fan service. Campy isn't too bad for me, but it does make the show a bit unapproachable to those who haven't been sucked in. This is hurting the ratings. We're getting so much camp that new viewers are shying away or out right leaving.

I hate how so many New Who writers think that making things impossibly big somehow makes them better or more exciting. It's become a trope of New Who that you should throw in some really huge scale to make the Doctor even more important. Whenever there's a concept like a planet-sized creature, the universe getting rebooted, or everyone on Earth turning into the Master—I just groan and roll my eyes. The scale is so ridiculous that it makes it hard to suspend your disbelief or feel compelled by the action.

It's frustrating because there are plenty of opportunities for truly epic character moments that are squandered. There should have been episodes where the Doctor first meets Vastra, Jenny and Strax. There should have been an episode where the Doctor is unable to function and puts everyone in danger because he's caught up in his feelings for River. There should have been a whole season with the threat that the Doctor has run out of regenerations.

Women Writers’ TV Employment Remains Static

Women remained underrepresented by a factor of nearly 2 to 1 among television writers in 2012, claiming just 27 percent of sector employment.

Women TV Writers Close Income Gap

Women television writers earned about 92 cents for every dollar earned by white males in 2012, up slightly from 91 cents in 2009.

Women Screenwriters Lose Ground in Film

In the film sector, women writers fell further behind their white male counterparts in 2012, accounting for just 15 percent of sector employment (down from 17 percent in 2009). Women remained underrepresented by a factor of more than 3 to 1 among screenwriters.

Gender Earnings Gap in Film Widens Again

The gender earnings gap in film has traditionally been greater than the gap in television. Women film writers earned just 77 cents for every dollar earned by white male film writers in 2012, down from 82 cents in 2009.

There have been TONS of studies showing how pervasive implicit bias is.  Everyone has implicit bias.  You do.  I do.  And we should work to counteract it.

With respect to any enterprise, including the Doctor Who franchise, those in charge should pay particular attention to the dangers of implicit bias.  And that involves being very conscious of the sorts of decisions you're making, including about who to recruit as writers.  Should a woman be hired simply because she's a woman?  Of course not.  She should be hired because she's a talented writer who would be well suited to the task.  That the Doctor Who team hasn't found even one to write for the show in the last six years is very strong evidence that women are simply not being considered.  

As for strong female roles -- I just disagree with you that a companion can't be a strong, independent figure.  Not independent of the Doctor.  Strong women characters in other shows (my first thought goes to Buffy in BtVS and Veronica in Veronica Mars, but also Zoe in Firefly) have relationships and need other people.

There are methodologies for measuring the reading age of an article.  They'll tell you that it requires a reading age of X.  That more or less means that a standard person of age X should have the vocabulary and comprehension to understand it.

So, when you see that sort of claim *(and where it's not simply someone repeating something they once heard without knowing the detail)* that's the sort of thing it's based on.

That said, the reading age doesn't actually mean, *""A seven year-old will understand this!""*  Since it's contextually pertinent, if you think about a Sun Article about the Conservative desire to shred the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new act:  A seven year old might know all *(or nearly all)* the words they plainly wouldn't understand all the context.  What's a politician?  Why are human rights important?  What do they want to change?  Who are the Conservatives?  How are they different to Wallace?  I like Wallace, he has funny trousers!  Why do people keep calling that smiley man with the funny teeth a kipper?

The statement is usually made dismissively.  Often it's stated as, ""The average Sun reader has the vocabulary of a seven year-old.""  This is both inaccurate and in my experience it's a fairly weak way of dismissing those people are ignorant.

There's a great deal to be said for making your statements as simple as possible.  Over and above the fact that from the point of view of a paper they want to be accessible to as many people as possible, clarity is almost always good.  Many people who write technical documents aim to write them in as clear and as simple a way as possible; since this lowers the possibility of incorrect interpretation.

The problems with the Sun are never *(or at least almost never)* an issue of the reading age it's written for.  They stem from peddling abhorrent ideas and pandering to the lowest common denominator on a political and social scale.

The problem with forcing equal demographics is that you wind up with people who are not qualified for the job just to even out the diversity of the job.

Let's say you have 9 male writers, the most senior of which has been writing Doctor Who episodes since 1966, and the most junior has been writing them since the return in 2005. Veteran, highly skilled, and highly acclaimed writers. But then you say wait a minute, they're all men? We need at least 3 women. So you hire 3 women writers who were loosely associated with the show. One was the sister of one of the producers and she just graduated with her liberal arts degree, another had been an actress on one episode of Dr Who but has no writing experience at all, and the third has a long list of writing credits except they were all for American sitcoms. So boom, in the snap of a finger you have completely solved the problem: the writing staff is way more diverse. But at what cost?

See, I'm all for female writers as long as they have the credentials. Show me a female writer who has been working on Dr Who since 1980. But guess what... there just aren't very many out there. So when you force women onto the show artificially just to say you have more women, you are decreasing the quality.

I'll concede that point on those terms- my experience differs from yours considerably.

&gt;Germany isn't far off that already, plus surely you've got to concede there are political impossibilities such as someone giving up their yearly cheap package holiday, and physical impossibilities such as us continuing to destroy the ecosystem and still, well existing. I think one is much more impossible than the other.

Things aren't *that* bad, though. We're not about to get to the point of extinction-via-ecosystem-collapse in the near, or even medium-to-long term. 

I don't disagree with the notion that current policy on climate change isn't enough- and I'd welcome much stronger measures to deal with it. But the problem's that that kind of thing *won't be enough* with places like China and India finally catching up with the developed world. Scaling back's the only way we could seriously help our emissions problem- and any savings would get wiped out by Chinese and Indian growth within the space of a single year, at most. Any initiative that would actually stand a chance of being constructive needs to be dealt with at the international level- and while China's building a new coal-fired power plant every single week to scrabble up to powering a population just about equivalent to the Western World in its entirety, that's not going to happen. That's the mother of all propaganda coups to anti-reductions folks- without clear, *multilateral* commitments to emissions reduction, any improvements in the situation would be swept away by the Chinese government's drive to give its people a decent standard of living

It's not a compelling enough case to sway enough of the electorate. There really needs to be more. The Lib Dems, for all their myriad faults, are in a position to deliver more in actual outcomes than the Greens have been able to deliver over the past forty years.

&gt;I think you could probably convince me on this, there are some solid arguments in favor of nuclear, but then again once I speak to someone anti nuclear they'd convince me of the opposite. I'm no physicist. Membership is something like £3 a month, join up, draft a motion, change the policy if you really are so sure, I think it's going to be easier to get the Greens to go nuclear than to get any other party to go green.

Ah, the same goes for the Lib Dems- who've recently, *finally* made the leap to supporting nuclear. 

The Liberals have been a party that formulates policy democratically for a long, long time. For most people, I'd say that the Lib Dems are a better choice than the Greens in that respect, if joining up and advocating a change in party policy matters to them- the positions being put forward tend to be significantly less controversial/problematic. 

&gt;I used to think the Lib Dems were more to the left of Labour, that simply isn't the case though, they just seem to be an alternative option for people who don't like Labour or Tory, appearing to be whatever the voter wants. If you are a tory but don't think they are liberal enough, go lib dem. If you are a labour supporter but don't think they are left wing enough go lib dem, they have policies to convince you of each assessment. 

This is certainly true, to an extent- but it misrepresents the party in a fundamental way. Certainly, the party positions itself between Labour and the Tories- that's where that tiresome ""Stronger Economy, Fairer Society"" schtick comes from. But, that has to be set in the context of what the party actually *stands* for- it's a qualitatively different kind of social progressivism than the kind you find in Labour, and a much, *much* more tempered kind of economic liberalism than one finds in the Tories- all wrapped in a hybrid Liberal ideology that's developed within the party for more than a century and a half. 

&gt;To me they still rely to much on private donations from rich individuals

Laughable, given how impoverished the Lib Dems are when set against the big two. Running effective national campaigns isn't cheap- and it's something the Greens have never managed to do. 

Even disregarding that, though- people who want political influence simply *do not donate to the Liberal Democrats*. The reasons behind that are fairly obvious- and the party's spent the past five years skirting the edges of bankruptcy because of it. Unlike the Conservatives, the LDs have to scrimp and save for every single penny they have to spend on campaigns. 

&gt;plus the votes are delegate votes as far as I understand rather than membership votes, correct me if I'm wrong.

To my not inconsiderable dismay, [as of this week, this is no longer the case](http://www.libdems.org.uk/f6_one_member_one_vote). The Lib Dems are solidly OMOV now. 

I think the delegate system was a touch more likely to produce more representative votes- attending conference is an extremely expensive business, when you fall outside the concessionary rates. Better to vote to send somebody representative of your region and save several hundred pounds' costs to finance a stay in somewhere as far-flung as Glasgow for three days. 

I understand why the change has been pushed through, though- and I'm hoping that it turns out well. [That said (1m40), there are some dismal potential consequences that are yet to be worked out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL2doPumti4). And that only covers a few of the problems- the full set of debates is deeply worrying. Add that to the fact that I'm habitually inclined to feel faintly nauseated by the sight of Tim Farron praising something, and you've got something that concerns me a fair bit. 

But, OMOV is in place now. For better of worse, the motion's been passed- and it's here to stay. We're now, unfortunately, not just ""democratic"", so much as the 

&gt;If they were against TTIP and PFI and supported Rail and Energy nationalization, reform of the NHS to undo it's marketisation, Ecological Tax Reform, a citizens income / reverse income tax / basic income I'd seriously consider supporting them

I'm not going to patronise you by suggesting that you should join up to agitate for changing policy- but aspects of what you propose are things that the Lib Dems aren't all that far from.

The party has strong inclinations along all those lines, *but they're not presently core priorities*. The Lib Dems are a centre-Liberal party with very strong progressive inclinations- but the case for something like a basic income flat-out hasn't been made yet in the political consensus, and the electoral harm sure to stem from adopting such a policy would outweigh the benefits to such an extent that it'd severely impact the party's ability to do what it was brought into existence to do- make a difference however it can. 

Issue-by-issue, though. 

TTIP? Controversial, even within the party- but the most one can expect from a minority party in any context is to advocate for alterations to a treaty, if the majority element of a coalition is devoted to the idea, and drags the majority consensus with them. TTIP is significantly than the UK- in this respect, the only constructive, *effective* input any political representatives can have is by working within the policy process. 

PFI? The problematic contracts in question that people crow about were signed, by and large, around ten years ago. There are billions upon billions of pounds riding on the things- they're not something that can be straight-up scrapped overnight. Senior Lib Dems have been critical of the implementation of the things for a good while- it's not an issue the party's exactly marched behind in lockstep.

false,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat  | /r/LibDem,"&gt;Rail and Energy nationalization

Rail nationalisation? Not all that *hugely* controversial view within the party. I'm surprised it didn't get some more traction at this past conference- if nothing else, the public mood is swinging that way. But the Lib Dems aren't naturally a party of nationalisation- their liberal roots stand against that, obviously, and the memory of British Rail is still pretty powerful. The thing with the Lib Dems is that they're not necessarily implacably opposed to nationalisation, *or* privatisation- there's none of the ideological fetishism that pushes forward the Tories, or the kneejerk inclination towards the former that lingers in older left-wingers. They're straight-up pragmatic- and, at the risk of that coming across as defending what some would term insipid policy, I'd argue that that's what's *necessary*

&gt;reform of the NHS to undo it's marketisation

While the internal market and the like [isn't without its problems](http://www.civitas.org.uk/nhs/download/Civitas_LiteratureReview_NHS_market_Feb10.pdf), it's also not had *that* significant an impact upon the more desperate elements of NHS provision.

Given the national shame that's the NHS' mental health provision, I'd say that the Lib Dems' focus on issues like that is rather more important than fretting over internal funding arrangements. I've noticed that a good chunk of the left's oppositions to NHS marketisation stem from the very presence of the term ""market"", rather than being focused on results- there shouldn't *necessarily* be a flat-out ban on private contractors, I'd say- just better administration of the contracts. Just as the private sector doesn't necessarily do things better, the public sector isn't perfect either. 

So much of the objections to the NHS internal market and its successor schemes are driven by hysterical propaganda. There's no ""wholesale privatisation of the NHS"", as protest after protest decrees- it's a much more complex thing than that, which isn't universally bad. The issue's in the implementation- and I'd be surprised if leaping back to a pre-Thatcher system as some seem to advocate would actually improve care more significantly than modifying the present setup.

The NHS is very, *very* far from being perfect. It deserves criticism in a fairly substantial catalogue of cases. I'm enormously grateful for it, but there's no inherent aspect of it that makes it somehow beyond reproach. 


&gt;What would it take for you to give up on the Lib Dems anyhow?

Giving up on Civil Liberties as a defining plank of the party's reason for existence. 

I left for the better part of a year after the Secret Courts vote. The thing that drove me back in the end was the realisation that, if any party's going to have a chance at pushing for a fairer society, a balanced economic stance, and *actually do something about constitutional reform before the rapture*, it's the Liberal Democrats- the occasional infuriating screwup notwithstanding. 

There really is nobody else. Had the AV vote (the first shot at electoral reform since women's suffrage, secured entirely on Liberal Democrat backs, and *the best the party could get in coalition full stop, given its declared status as a Tory Red Line*, before you bounce out with the No to AV/Yes to PR useful idiocy) gone the right way, that wouldn't necessarily be the case anymore- but the vote went the wrong way. So we're stuck with the best option we have left- and, in my view, that's the Liberal Democrats. 

&gt;Whats a Great deal of policy as well? Has anybody looked at the parties manifestos before the election and seen how much they were able to actually do?

[Aye](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/).

Of course, the ""70% of the Lib Dem Manifesto delivered in the government programme"" claim that's bandied about whenever this is brought up hasn't quite panned out over the course of this government- it's ended up being somewhere between 45% and 70%, depending on how things go through the next six months. 

But even in the absolute worst case scenario- that's 45% that *would not have happened, under any conceivable circumstances* with the Green Party.

River Song is at her core an adventurer. She does not put up with people's shit, because she's seen too much to bother. She's a rehabilitated psychopath, and she's sorry for it all, but does *not* let that get her down. When the Doctor goes wrong, she's more than happy to slap him, but she's not about to yell at him. She just wants him to remember who he's supposed to be. She's an archaeologist, so she can track the Doctor through time, because she's very happy to pretend she doesn't love everything about him, but the reason she doesn't tell him that is not because she's embarrassed, it's because she doesn't want his head getting bigger. Because she doesn't take people's shit.

Clara is at her heart a carer. I think that was a brilliant description of her. She cares about others so deeply, she takes care of those around her, teaches, and doesn't take the Doctor's shit because of it. But there's a fundamental difference there. When she slaps the Doctor, it's because she's terrified for everyone around her, and the doctor is not paying proper attention to them. She is not fearless. She is not an adventurer. She goes on adventures, and she's certainly not cowardly, but she's not fearless. She's not ""I can match the Doctor, and I'm happy to show it"" she's ""I know I'm not on the same level as the Doctor intellectually, and I'm not going to let him rub that in my face, because he's not on my level emotionally."".
