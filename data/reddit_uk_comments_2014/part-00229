On Reddit, especially over on /r/soccer, new American fans are seen as *plastic* fans (i.e. not real fans) either following a team because

* They played as them on FIFA. A common joke about Arsenal is that they're so popular abroad because they're the first team in the league (A for Arsenal) and their nickname is the Gunner's (LOL MURICA) because of the cannon on their crest. 

* The team is good *but not too good* because who wants a team that loses all the time? and who wants a team that wins all the time?

* The team is well known abroad. i.e. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United.

* The team bought their success, i.e. Chelsea and Manchester City

* Their grandad's uncle's nephew's sister is from *insert English city here*

* ""The United States National Men's Team (USMNT) played well in the World Cup, I may just give this ""soccer"" thing a go.""

* ""Liverpool were losing too much so I decided to swap to Everton!"" If you say this, you've lost the respect of everyone, Liverpool fans won't want you because you're a bandwagoner, and Everton fans won't want you because you're a Liverpool fan.

I personally don't believe this. Who cares where you're from so long as you support the team through thick and thin, but some people believe this. I'd rather tell you this now, than have you get downvoted for asking a question.

All I want is a decent (~~good~~ great but not quite world class) backup that can provide cover in less important games, be substituted on in games where Sturridge isn't as effective as one would hope, allow sturridge to rest when necessary, and being able to do a fairly decent job for a month if Sturridge gets injured. To be fair, I think Lambert could contribute to that, but I'd prefer it if we also had a backup striker more similar to Sturridge.

**I believe that Sturridge is genuine world class**, and should 100% be the focal point of Liverpools attack for the next six to eight years (He's only 24! 2 younger than Agüero, 3 younger than Suarez!). Sturridge thrives on trust, and that is what we should all give him, and spending 40-60 million quid on another striker is not the answer.

To me, Remy was the perfect fit, as they are both relatively similar types of players, and he could also cover on the flanks if necessary. Bony however, is a very differeny striker compared to Sturridge, and even worse he can't even be played out wide. Also, the price tag is a bit iffy.

I think if we were to make a ""marquee signing"", I'd prefer it be in a position where the big-money signing would be the truly dominant first choice, as that would more effectively strengthen the squad. Personally, i would much rather have Ricardo Rodriguez at left back for every game of the season, than have Falcao/Cavani only play half a season because he has to be rotated with Sturridge.

Gramsci answered it thus; “…two major superstructural ‘levels’: the one that can be called ‘civil society’, that is, the ensemble of organisms commonly called ‘private’, and that of ‘political society’ or ‘the state’. These two levels correspond on the one hand to the functions of ‘hegemony’ which the dominant group exercises throughout society and on the other hand to that of ‘direct domination’ or command exercised through the state and ‘juridical’ government.” “The “spontaneous” consent given by the great masses of the population to the general direction imposed on social life by the dominant fundamental group” and “the apparatus of state coercive power which “legally” enforces discipline on those groups who do not “consent” either actively or passively.” So it is not simply through the repressive powers of the state – though this is obviously an important aspect of their control – because in advanced capitalist countries many people accept the order of things. Gramsci argues that the bourgeois class has a form of ideological hegemony over the rest of us, that their power is both centralised in the state apparatus proper but also diffused across society, through the media, family traditions, religious institutions and so on. These hegemonic ideas are the ideas of the ruling class, it is an acceptance or at least a toleration of forms of inequality and oppression. This point is entirely related to Marx and Engel’s position in the German Ideology that “For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.”'",0,1407455871,null,0,false,0,cjk10yt,t3_2cvs88,t1_cjk10yt,t1_cjk0hwc,null,1435128376,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It made us fun to watch and a favourite with the neutrals (also helped that last season we finished 7th and we were 1st for a while, which no team outside of 4th has done) because you were guaranteed goals somewhere.

[Surprisingly, we were still second top goal scorers.](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html?season=2013-2014&amp;month=MAY&amp;timelineView=date&amp;toDate=1399762800000&amp;tableView=CURRENT_STANDINGS)",0,1407456440,null,0,false,0,cjk1ap2,t3_2cxawn,t1_cjk1ap2,t1_cjk0wny,null,1435128440,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

So far we are yet to adequately replace Suarez, Lambert is more of Aspas' replacement, and hopefully we'll be able to sign one of Cavani, Falcao or an yet unknown quality striker. our bench is much stronger then last season, but to date, our starting 11 with the departure of Luis is weaker. 

If we manage to sign a good striker though, my qualms will be relieved. Most of the stars of our first team are young, and will have learned and developed from the title race last year and come as better players. Can, Markovic and Lallana give us better, different options off the bench, and once we find an adequate striker we should be better off, both in the short and long run.

In this case because on the one hand it's clear that an intolerable amount of civilians are being caught in the crossfire and the rest are fleeing for their lives. But on the other hand you have to bear in mind that if Assad loses this civil war then Isis will take over and if that happens we're going to be in trouble. Syria borders Israel, a likely target for the IS, and also a nuclear power willing to use those weapons to protect their citizens if necessary. And then we think about all the weapons IS might then have if they defeat Assad and take over the government's armory...

I'm just saying, the Syria conflict is a complex conflict, and it's not one of those conflicts where it's The Good Guys vs The Bad Guys.

* Cup winners: 
Celtic Scottish cup (I know Motherwell getting into Europe again... ), Aberdeen retain the league cup.

* First manger to get stacked / leave: Hughes 

* Another good split where there lots of teams within a shot of being either play off or relegation. 

* In the championship there a big upset in the play offs and Falkirk or QOTS come up along with Hearts both The Rangers and Hibs stay down for another season.

* Prepare your heart we don't really do things easily.

* Support us through the ups and downs, don't just go and support someone else as they are doing better.

Buying a striker is not necessarily the best way to fix the goal gap created by Suarez leaving. Another attacking player like a Reus, Alexis or Shaquiri could provide the support as a second striker for Lambert or Borini if he stays as neither of them look comfortable playing by themselves upfront like Sturridge does. They also wouldn't have to play second fiddle to Sturridge and gives that other option in midfield. 

The other point is that the answer could be Lazar Markovic or Raheem Sterling, but going into a very full season without insurance seems too risky for FSG.

Trust Jose. We have one of the best in-form strikers in the world with Diego Costa. Torres will be only used as a back-up and sub with Didier Drogba another back-up/super-sup.

He still has experience and I trust Jose to use his him effectively, along with Didier. People on this board need to calm down and just get on with it. Theres a lot of Torres hate, I can understand it but just let it go and think about the positives. If its an emergency and drogba/costa somehow get injured Jose will always have andre schurrle or hazard to play up top.

Also, remember how close we were to securing the title last year with an aging Eto'o and a inconsistent Torres. Now we actually have a in-form striker as well as a quality CM in Cesc and other additions in the team, not to mention the second season in which Jose is in charge.

&gt;WHEN British politicians talk about winning the “global economic race” (as they often do) they have athletes like Gregor Wilson in mind. Mr Wilson taught himself to code as a child. He started and built his first company while at university and sold it on graduating. His second venture, a software firm, is booming and will soon be ready to take on more staff. He is also preparing to leave Britain for good.

&gt;In the popular imagination, British expats are leathery retirees in the Mediterranean. But from 2006 onwards the weak pound, the bursting of Spain’s property bubble and rising taxes in France made the costas less attractive. The number of old Britons emigrating annually has more than halved since then. Dean Blackburn, head of HSBC Expat, part of the high-street bank, says that a different breed of emigrant is now on the march: the ambitious graduate bound for North America or Asia.

&gt;The sharpest rise has been among those moving to the glittering East (see chart). Mr Wilson will build his business in Hong Kong. The web, along with the reach of the English language and the cachet of a British degree, gives young people like him opportunities undreamed-of by their parents’ generation. They are also untethered for longer: on average, they buy a house and form a family later in life than did previous generations. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that, since the eve of the economic crisis, emigration is down by 19% overall but up by 8% among 15- to 24-year-olds.

&gt;High housing costs help to drive young folk abroad. For the monthly rent on a rabbit hutch anywhere near central London, graduates live grandly elsewhere. “We can afford to travel around Australia, rent an apartment with a sea view and save some money,” explains Emma, a publisher and recent Oxford graduate who moved to Melbourne last year. Those with advanced degrees are especially likely to leave for countries where pay and research facilities are better.

&gt;This is regrettable. Britain’s productivity rate is puny; firms and factories badly need such skilled employees. But it is also an opportunity—which the country is squandering.

&gt;According to the World Bank, the British diaspora (at nearly 5m people, roughly the size of Scotland) is the largest of any rich country and the eighth biggest overall. Britain’s many expats could strengthen its trading links, channel investment into its economy and generally burnish the national brand. But Britain’s government seems to have “no coherent strategy” for engaging with them, says Alan Gamlen of the Oxford Diasporas Programme, a research unit at Oxford University.

&gt;Of 193 UN member states, 110 have formal programmes to build links with citizens abroad. Britain is not one of them. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s database of Britons abroad is patchy. Of all the high-flying expats with British passports your correspondent asks, only one—Danny Sriskandarajah, a migration expert based in South Africa—has had any contact with local embassies or with UKTI, Britain’s trade-promotion body. And his Indian friend has received much more attention from his consulate.

&gt;Indeed, India is a trailblazer in this field. It has an entire ministry for its emigrants. Mr Gamlen says it partly has this to thank for the success of its IT industry, built by Indians lured home from Silicon Valley and Europe. Other countries are similarly welcoming. Italy and France even reserve parliamentary seats for their diasporas.

&gt;The British government would probably have to work harder than most to sustain ties with the country’s expats. Britons are relatively good at melting into other countries without trace. They are a individualistic bunch, have Commonwealth links and a native language that often makes it easy to integrate.

&gt;Kiwi seeds

&gt;New Zealand offers a good model for Britain’s hands-off diplomats to emulate. Wellington has spent 30 years encouraging firms and philanthropists to root out Kiwis abroad. Its proudest achievement is the Kiwi Expat Association, a public-private partnership that supports and connects overseas New Zealanders through social media and networking events, and helps them return home if they so wish. Britain might also make it easier to bring spouses into the country. Expats who want to move back with their non-British partners often collide with their home country’s ever-tougher immigration regime.

&gt;If Britain does not want its talented globetrotters, others do. Germany actively recruits Britons to take apprenticeships there. Middle Eastern governments tour British universities doling out visas. Mr Wilson was contacted out of the blue by the Chinese authorities, who invited him to relocate his firm and offered to pay for his flight. “America and China seem really keen to attract us,” he says. “Britain just doesn’t seem that interested.”",0,1407475535,null,0,false,0,cjk9vqf,t3_2cwred,t1_cjk9vqf,t1_cjk4r5a,null,1435132819,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I wasn't Mourinho worshiping. With the attacking talent they had, they could/should have won the league last year. Regardless, he beat BR (the manager of the year) in that day's match-up.

Gerrard was the deepest player when he slipped. It's the formation and the tactic that got us that close to the title, but add a fucking ounce of pragmatism and conservatism and we would have had dropped our back line a bit deeper than the midfield line and had a flat back four behind him to defend and see off the final minute of the first half.

Hindsight is 20/20 obviously, but the high defensive line and attacking style leaves us vulnerable to where individual mistakes almost always result in a goal scoring chance for the other team. Yes, the players obviously deserve some of the blame, but it's the manager putting them in those precarious positions.

I'm on a zero hours contract, and I get an extra twelve and a bit percent on top of my pre-tax pay every month in lieu of holiday.

I think part of the reason the Gov doesn't work so hard to engage with expats is that it simply doesn't have to. If a Brit wants to ""trade-up"" their life(style) they can simply move to another part of the country.  My career took off when I moved from Liverpool to London in the 80s.

I've worked in places like Dubai, Singapore, Paris, NYC, Amsterdam, yada yada yada and eventually wound up in Vancouver, which is where I have to stay now, god help me.
The point being that when you've lived most of your life living in the UK (and especially in London) then generally you're not trading up when you move abroad.

There's those that're looking for something specific,sun, beach, outdoorsy stuff, a particular passion for the culture of the country of your choice, etc. But by and large the Gov doesn't have to work to maintain contact with the expats, for the most part we moved abroad coz we felt we had to for one reason or another, and most of us will be heading back home cap in hand after a few years.

From a playing standpoint, I assume you've only watched him at the World Cup? Where he was fixed into a static role and under-performed due to it. He's not an all-out striker, he can leave that to Sturridge. He can patrol the lines behind the main striker and prepares to run off him, he is a very intelligent player who is constantly making runs to spread the defence and wear them out, creating space for others.

**EDIT**

I'll explain my high hopes for St Mirren. I've been following them just as religiously as Celtic through pre season and they're looking fantastic. Winning some high scoring games. 

They've brought in a couple of good players. Calum Ball a great new kid who scored five goals in two games. They have managed to keep a hold of Kello. A fantastic keeper who really should be on to a bigger team. Also got a new boy Marwood who's scored a few and is ripping defenders to shreds. Goodwin has the team playing great together. Knowing my knowledge of football I'll probably be wrong but it's a completley different team dynamic this year.

It came on the back of heightened PIRA activity at the time. Hundreds of genuinely innocent Catholics were imprisoned with absolutely no power to do anything, and the British army and RUC were notably forceful and violent in removing ""suspects"" from their homes and families to be locked up and were also found guilty of ""ill treatment"" of detainees.

This campaign didn't go as planned, though, as the PIRA recruited even more members at the time. Here's a quote from the CAIN website on internment:

*"" During that time 1,981 people were detained; 1,874 were Catholic / Republican, while 107 were Protestant / Loyalist. Internment had been proposed by Unionist politicians as the solution to the security situation in Northern Ireland but was to lead to a very high level of violence over the next few years and to increased support for the IRA.""*

Lib dems on the other hand are still very likely to be in the next goverment in some format. So the manifesto has to actually be implementable.

true,jaaykidd,celtic,,"There is now a massive disconnect between us and The Board. It's been fermenting since WGS's time, when we went on at length here on KDS about how he wasn't getting the support to bring the kind of players he wanted and how apparent it was that signings were being made over his head (Riordan, Gravesen).

We were concerned that WGS's appointment in the first place was evidence of downsizing: with MON's 'life in the slow lane' comment still ringing in our ears, we replaced him with an out of work manager whose modest experience was with small clubs who would set out not to lose games, and we feared - with some justification, as it would turn out - he would be a Yes man. They then gave Tony Mowbray the job despite his not having a CV to warrant it, but who was also a compliant Yes man.

Lenny's appointment was more evidence of downsizing of ambition, whether we like to admit it or not. Lawwell knew this fine well, so much so they embarked on their roadshow, to persuade scunnered fans to renew season tickets by playing the emotional card. And Neil, too, for all his pride and fire, put too much faith his good relationships with Lawwell and Desmond, trusting them to do the right thing. For all the mistakes he made, they let him down. Allan Thomson, then Big Mjalby then Neil were forced out the door, and replaced with the young guy from a little club in a little league who only months before was approached to be his assistant; and pairing him with Lawwell's choice of assistant, the out of work John Collins. We have ample evidence of downsizing, alright, and I haven't mentioned them interviewing the out of work Mark McGhee before choosing Mowbray!

Dole birds without clubs to compensate or large salaries to better; compliant Yes Men who wouldn't take a stand against players being bought and sold against their will, and diminishing budgets; ex players who might put up with interference due to their emotional attachment to the club: we've had them all. Much glory and happy days was achieved, but not without pain. For all the great success he steered his teams to, WGS's tenure remains a bone of contention due to what became known on KDS as The Malaise, when the football was so poor and the mood so dark that season ticket holders couldn't summon up the enthusiasm to take the seats they had paid for. Much of Neil's reign was also grim stuff. These are the obvious gripes , but there is much more which adds to the disconnect.

I really don't know if the online tales are true, of Lawwell's eagerness to sell players due to being incentivised to increase turnover, or of his/John Park controlling the buying and selling players, but I do know the club has abandoned ambition and chosen to stay in 2nd gear since the huns death; exploiting the feel good factor, not to grow and celebrate all that is good about Celtic, but to take liberties with our dedication. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know The Board (I'm using this a catch-all term for those who run The Club) have not only failed to defend Celtic supporters against the wildy unjust Offensive Behaviour at Football Act and the actions of Focus, they have actively collaborated with them in the persecution of Celtic fans. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know they meekly rolled over and merely stated they were ""disappointed"" with the outcome of the LNS farce. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know they shamefully spiked the GB's food bank collection last year. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know they shamefully dismissed the Living Wage motion at the last AGM. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know they shamefully shower us with pathetically transparent platitudes that seek to tug on our heartstrings, emotional blackmail citing our wonderful heritage and historical bond with the club, in the absence of substantial commitment by them. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know £1m is an extraordinarily high salary for a CEO of a medium sized enterprise with a turnover that will seldom, if ever, exceed £75-£80m. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know I and many more supporters are sickened at the apparent willingness to ignore a catalogue of anti social and unprofessional transgressions by some players, while hounding out model pro's like Ledley and Samaras. That adds to the disconnect.

I do know that many, many supporters are embarrassed at the Board's apparent willingness to whore the team out to any shi tty little friendly that will generate...well, how much, exactly? Was that Spurs drubbing in Finland really worth it, during CL qualifiers? Or the subsequent, justified criticism by the organisers of the club for the team of kids. That adds to the disconnect.

There is so much more wrong than just an early, embarrassing CL exit. I've never felt more alienated, more disconnected from those who run - and many who play for - our club. And the final insult may yet arise: we have grave reservations about the club's apparent inactivity in pursuing justice over the huns' &amp; SFA's decades of cheating. Lawwell temporarily placated those guys at the last AGM with a promise that he was indeed on the case of the SFA granting the huns a euro licence whilst owing taxes, and that passing the motion would set a course of action in place that would jeopardise his investigations. I don't know what timescale he is working to, but that's nearly a year. Surely the time is nearing for him to reveal either what action he is going to take, or to give the guys the nod to raise the motion again this year. There are some pretty serious folk behind that motion: if he's trying to pull the wool over their eyes and attempting a fudge, they'll suss him out.

&gt;

&gt;__Roy Race__ is a British comic strip character, a professional football player who appears in the comic strip ""[Roy of the Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_of_the_Rovers_(comic\))"". The strip first appeared in the boys' comic Tiger in 1954, continuing for 22 years before giving its name to a new weekly (and later monthly) comic magazine, published by IPC and Fleetway from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature. 

&gt;The character is a fondly remembered childhood memory for several generations of British men.

That's a farce. Nobody is ""so specialised"" they can sort your problem out in a single day.

Every problem requires analysis, understanding, and solving.

Yes, you have people who have more experience in a particular area than another, but ultimately every issue requires perseverance and solving.

Paying out &gt;£1,000 is never warranted for mere consultancy. That is a political arrangement - *every time*.

  Until it's decriminalised, simple poss'n of drugs should not be imprisonable ,repeat offenders know the risks they take. 
As for sec 5 POA, if you end up in pokey you deserved it. 
  I do however agree that too often people who have good jobs, families ,ethics and deep regret are pariah'd  by overzealous magistrates and given custodial sentances when non is  necessary and social embarrassment and community punishment should be the norm. But again these are falling as a more holistic and common sense approach is adapted. 
  
The problem is there is a growing section of people who just don't care or respect the rules of society and for them pokey is the only alternative, there is also a growing population of people with acute or borderline mental and social disfunctions/alcoholism who social services can't cope with and the NHS don't have the facilities to deal with and are thus in a downward spiral into repetitive petty crime. Occasionally one of them kills someone and for a few weeks its headline news until the status quo returns and everyone goes back to burying their heads in the sand.

The fact that the DUP have more members (38 DUP, 30 needed for petition) than required for successful use of the petition of concern just allows for the abuse to continue unabated.

The most ironic thing is, the DUP can block any motion to reform the conditions for the petition of concern, **by employing a petition of concern**.

It's fucking ridiculous.

Ok then, 'spineless' whatever that means in this context. 

&gt;1). Promises not to raise tuition fees, repeatedly, makes it a core policy for his election campaign. This was the main reason the Lib Dems rose in popularity in 2010

Was a core promise for Labour too, as another poster has pointed out, twice in fact. But apprenlty thouse guys are ok. 

&gt;2). Enters coalition with Cons (an issue in of itself but anyway), then he doesn't just agree to raise tuition fees, but agrees to TRIPLE them.

Countries finances were and are fucked. It was a promise that should not have been made. But its not even close (again throwing the contet open to the entire western world) to the first time, or the last time a party makes promises in opposition that turn out to be unimplementable in government. It's actually really common.

Also this whole 'coalition bad thing', a minority government is not a good thing, even in boom times. That's just silly mate (if a popular opinion). 

&gt;3). Apologises two years later. Because his PR department told him to.

Again if we are nailing him to the cross for having a P.R department, why are we not nailing all politicans to the cross.

I'm not a fan of modern politics either and how its all about narrative and image. But making the Liberal democrats out as complete fuckers based on criteria, that by your own lights casts pretty much every party that was in a government in the western world, for at least the last 50 years also fail by, in the British case often by orders of magnitude more. fuck man you know FDR campaigned on anti-war isolationist stance more than once?

I'm still not convinced how this is a logical standpoint. 


Yeah i'm a lib dem. Pour hate down if you wish. But its hard to not sit by and thnik 'wow this countries politics are fucked', when the likely outcome of the next election is about 20 or so seats going lib to labour, predicated on this outrage, which apparently stops at putting any meaningful scrutiny on the party your voting for instead. 

If you didn't make promises you couldn't keep you wouldnl't get elected in modern politics, it's shit, but there is it, and its due to a complex list of problems stemming from the 4th estate to modern 'image' politics. If you want to hate the system fine, but hating on a subpart of the system and maintaining a partisan political stance. That doesn't really make sense.

true,Growlbot_,lfc87,,"It is, you're right. While I'm being hypercritical in my original post that isn't to say Rodgers doesn't deserve incredible credit for last season. He took a side predicted to finish 5-7th and had them within three points of winning the title. Amazing really. I still feel Chelsea highlighted Rodgers' tactical Achilles heel however, in that he expected our A game to be enough (last season at least). Which is weird when, as you say, Chelsea are incredibly hard to break down and he knows all about Mourinho's philosophy from having worked under him for a long period. Mourinho even threw quite obvious bait down before the game about a weakened side. Jose had learnt everything not to do from the mistakes City made at Anfield a week before.

Like you say, hindsight is a wonderful thing but the way Mourinho celebrated showed clearly what it meant to him to beat Rodgers. Perhaps it will change now we have more options this season. The press conference was fascinating to me after the game, just to see how Rodgers reacted from the loss. It will also be interesting to see this season if we don't start off with a bang. It is a heck of a high watermark set last season, many on here will say that doesn't matter, that we overperformed, but externally it will add pressure come christmas time if we aren't top 3-4. I hope for an excellent start of course, but I wonder if people might be a bit used to the great run we had last season and come to expect it now.

&gt;**5 Harassment, alarm or distress.**
&gt;
(1)A person is guilty of an offence if he—
&gt;
(a)uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or
&gt;
(b)displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting,
&gt;
within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.
&gt;
(2)An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place, except that no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is displayed, by a person inside a dwelling and the other person is also inside that or another dwelling.
&gt;
(3)It is a defence for the accused to prove—
&gt;
(a)that he had no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, or
&gt;
(b)that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed, would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling, or
&gt;
(c)that his conduct was reasonable.
&gt;
(4)A constable may arrest a person without warrant if—
&gt;
(a)he engages in offensive conduct which [F2a] constable warns him to stop, and
&gt;
(b)he engages in further offensive conduct immediately or shortly after the warning.
&gt;
(5)In subsection (4) “offensive conduct” means conduct the constable reasonably suspects to constitute an offence under this section, and the conduct mentioned in paragraph (a) and the further conduct need not be of the same nature.
&gt;

The idea is that if you have £10, then what has happened is that you have really been paid £12.50, but 20% of that has gone to income tax (£12.50 x 0.8 = £10). Charitable donations are generally tax-exempt (I think, someone correct me on this if I am wrong). So in theory instead of giving the £10 to charity, you could give them £12.50 before tax from your payslip, or give them £10 then complete a tax return and get back £2.50 and give that to them as well. Gift aid just makes this a lot easier.

Charities can only claim basic rate tax (20%) for gift aid, so if you are a higher-rate taxpayer you can additionally fill in a tax return for the difference.

the pro is that - clearly - the charity gets 20% extra on top of what you've given them. 

some potential cons (depending on how you view them): 

* if you aren't a 20% taxpayer, you can't (shouldn't) claim gift aid. Say you are retired/unemployed, you don't pay tax for the aid to be deducted from. i think it's technically an offense to do so, though i suspect it's entirely ignored.

* highly divisive point, but you are giving money to a charity and taking it from the government.  That could be a pro or con, depending on who you trust more to spend the money appropriately. i'd be annoyed by people gift-aiding to Kony 2012, for example. 

What some people may not know is that if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can reclaim the additional 20% gift-aid yourself in your tax return, though you'll need to keep records of your donations to do so.

Then there's Dave's porn filter, which was ""you should probably do it before we force you to"" and there's nothing illegal about avoiding that because you can just ask your ISP to turn it off anyway.

Immunicity started by unblocking the first set of sites, specifically providing a means to access sites which a court has ruled are a method of copyright infringement. It had moved on to a beta which also unblocked certain porn sites covered by the porn filter. I don't think that'll be enough to argue that the service wasn't deliberately and knowingly set up to facilitate copyright infringement. If it did proxy all sites rather than just the blocked ones, it would probably be OK. That's why court orders were needed to get the ISPs to block them - since ISPs provide access to all sites, they're not specifically designed to provide the means for copyright infringement.

It's not really twisting the wording:

No way. This lot won't just play and go home; they will be 1am drunken endings + the club night which ends at 4am. If you want to shout me £200 I'll happily do them all and report back.

He is good and could have an immidiate impact but we didnt buy him to start every game. Lallana and coutinho arent great on the wing and ibe is not good enough yet. I do believe we would benefit from a more polished player. I think Shaquiri fits in quite well as he is left-footed, fast with good technique and is still young. I would however not be opposed to adding an experienced more polished winger that is good enough to be our first choice. Isn't that why so many people here dream about reus? Because he would be a guaranteed starter, that would ease pressure of markovic and ensure lallana/coutinho arent required to perform out wide? Currently we have two fantasticly talented young wingers, but only raheem should be relied on to start every game next season. Markovic is new and needs time to settle we shouldnt rely on him as one of our 3 starting forwards in a 4-3-3 next season atleast. Because of that i fully support the idea of either bying a quality striker ala cavani to ""replace"" suarez in the 4-4-2 diamond formation we used last year or buying an ""reliable"" experienced quality winger ala lavezzi/cuadrado?/that unknown dortmund guy.

Red Pill seeks to address sexual market value, help you understand it and increase it in order to help you get laid and not get walked over in modern relationships. It is not political, it does not seek to change women's rights from what they are now, nor does it promote the idea that they should be different. 

Islam, on the other hand allows Muslim men to kill non-Muslims and take their wives and daughters (including children) as sex slaves. *This is happening literally right now in Iraq, where the Sunni Muslim group ISIS is murdering Yazidi, Christian and Shia men and taking their women into sex slavery.*

Had the added advantage of spreading it around Europe.

The issue with non-alcoholic-alcoholic drinks, other than that they have the potential to taste appalling (I'm looking at you non-alcoholic beer), is that they tend to be about as full of calories as beer.

The other jurors the documentary talked to sounded really angry that they didn't have the opportunity to put someone to death rather than life imprisonment. It was horrible. 

There was also another interesting interview with another woman, who's nephew (or something) was on trial with a chance at being put to death. She made the argument that, while what he did was horrible and that he deserve life in prison, by killing him, they would ruin the lives of his family, and that surely ruining the lives of two families is worse than just the one.

true,q_pop,null,null,"&gt; You have income from savings, investment or property
&gt; 
&gt; If you are an employee or a pensioner and already pay tax through a PAYE code, you can sometimes ask for tax that you owe on income, such as savings and property, to be collected through your code number. You'll need to complete a tax return instead if the income you receive is:
&gt; 
&gt;     £10,000 or more from taxed savings and investments
&gt;     £2,500 or more from untaxed savings and investments
&gt;     £10,000 or more from property (before deducting allowable expenses)
&gt;     £2,500 or more from property (after deducting allowable expenses)
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't pay tax through a PAYE code you’ll need to complete a tax return if all of the following apply:
&gt; 
&gt;     you have income to declare, for example income from savings, trusts or abroad, rental income from land or property
&gt;     your total income exceeds your total allowances and reliefs
&gt;     you have tax to pay on this income
&gt; 

Unless your incorrectly-taxed income falls into these bands you are not obliged to fill out a tax return.

Let's say /u/user24 has a bank account with £100 interest per year taxed at 20% - the time/expense of hiring an accountant to fill out a not-obligatory tax return (as recommended) is a bit pointless.

That said, you make a very valid point about obtaining higher-rate tax relief on personal pension contributions.

He went inside for ABH when he was 27, just a normal pub fight and this bouncer thought he was tasty, so he came at Ted but Ted bust his jaw then lamped a copper who came calling, as the slag bouncers mates stood there like pussies and phoned the filth rather than sorting it.

Anyway, Ted got a year, and in there he had a screw who thought he was it so Ted grabbed him and shoved him down the stairs.

So Ted got in with the wrong crowd there, who taught him thieving and burglary etc.

So Ted gets out, no employer wants to know (Ted was a sparky), and then an old mate from stir contacts him, does he want to be wireman on a London branch of Barclays.

Yeah Ted does, so one night the gang get in to the bank, but one of them was a stinking nark, so a wagon of plod came and arrested the lot.

Ted got a 5 stretch for that, and inside he learnt even more.

Ted gets out in '97, and back with his crowd.

That summer they do over a Securicor van and one of the crew accidentally paralysed the driver.

Anyway, they get nabbed after a while and Ted gets an 8 stretch which was grossly unfair as he didn't hurt anyone.

So inside Ted brews and plots, gets out in early '05 and does a solo job doing over a post office in Kent.
Ted don't realise one of the slags in the branch had recorded him on his phone so Ted gets arrested again.

He's still inside as he was carrying at the time.

I believe in foreign aid to stop them from starving or having their rights violated, but I don't believe we have any obligation to suffer so their needs can be taken into account. They could make laws and not exempt us. They don't, so obviously they both value our membership and don't think that us obeying their laws is especially important.

They value our membership, but they are getting sick of our ""we are special"" attitude.  They've made concessions for us, but they have no incentive to continue making concessions and them making concessions is holding back the EU.

&gt; We are more important the rest of the EU because we live here. Do you think our government should agree to limit our nation because of some EU law if it does not benefit us, just out of a sense of fair play?

You misunderstand me when I said that.  I meant from the EU perspective we are no more important than the other 27 member states.  Of course our government should put our needs first, but the fact is that we also need to accept there are 28 member states of the EU and the EU needs to be able to satisfy the needs of the other 27 member states as well and can't always make laws that satisfy only our needs.

&gt; We do have the right to undermine the processes of the EU because we have the right to do whatever we want because we are a sovereign nation.

No we don't.  When we signed the treaties allowing the EU to make laws, we agreed that we would do our best to implement the laws.

&gt; The EU does not represent the people of Britain

That's strange, because I swear I remember there was a recent election where we picked the people who would be our representatives in EU matters?  The fact is as long as we are electing representatives to European Parliament, the EU represents the people of Britain.

&gt; It is a voluntary organisation.

No it's not.  It's a politico-economic union - that's a huge fucking difference because it means the EU has political and economical capital as its own entity.  It is only voluntary in the sense that we can choose to leave.  It is no more of a voluntary organisation than the United Kingdom is a voluntary organisation consisting of England, Scotland, Wale and N.

Thing with Erik is he's seen as this traditional Bale-esque RW who looks to beat his man and cut inside, but he tends to drift more central and relies on his outrageous technique and creativity over sheer pace and athleticism (which I think he possesses anyway). He's LETHAL in the central positions, Totti's heir after all - if you watch him closely, he always looks to come inside rather than beating his man down the line. He's making the right noises and this is all good news - I think a lot of it is confidence. Bale looked good, but when he *believed* he was the main man - that's when he was special. Lamela has all those tools and more naturally over Bale (I genuinely believe that), and hearing this sounds like he's ready - he just needs that mindset of ''I can do what the fuck I want, and it WILL pay off''

I think it has to be fluid. Front 3 fluid, with the 2 CM's providing stabity, 2 ball playing CB's coming from deep with either Capoue (decent CB too) or Schenderlin dropping deep to cover like he did at Southampton. That allows our full backs to exploit the spaces as the opposing full backs come inside to track their runners (especially if we're fluid, it will cause so many problems for defences). In FM terms (sorry to have to use a PC game). It's more like playing a 4-2-3-1 with 3 AMC's and not 1 AMR, 1 AMC and 1 AML. 

Apart from Lennon and Townsend (Chadli maybe) we don't have any direct wingers, I consider Eriksen/Holtby/Lamela as AMC's rather than 2 AMC's and a AMR. I really REALLY want Poch to sit down with Anderos. Dude looked like the second coming of Robben in Englands qualifiers, and I've slated the kid a lot but if IF he doesn't fuck up this season, he should stay. He is 2 footed, quick, great technique and a bit too over confident. Maybe it was the pressure of Bale leaving and him ''taking over'', but with good coaching I think he can be a lethal RW cutting inside on his left. I just worry he's too old now to stamp out those habits he has (decision making)- 23 is old nowadays.

There's the [ Scottish football museum](http://www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/the-museum/) at Hampden but it's closed until Monday for the Commonwealth Games and probably is a pile of shite. You could do a stadium tour of either Celtic Park or Ibrox though. If you're interested in museums in general I would personally recommend the [Hunterian](http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/) museum, the [Riverside](http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/riverside/Pages/default.aspx) museum and if you're interested in Art then the [GoMA](http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/GoMA/Pages/default.aspx) and the [Kelvingrove](http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/kelvingrove/Pages/default.aspx) are worth a visit.

Other ideas; if you're a tea person then check out [Tchai-Ovna](http://tchaiovna.com/) in the west end, if you're more of a coffee person then go to [Artisan Roast](http://www.artisanroast.co.uk/pages/glasgow) for one of the best coffees you will find in the UK (from my unbiased perspective) and if you enjoy a whiskey then you're missing out if you don't visit [Dram!](http://www.dramglasgow.co.uk/dram/dram-home/dram-glasgow.html). Other good places for food include the [Hanoi Bike Shop](http://www.thehanoibikeshop.co.uk/), [Stravaigin](http://www.stravaigin.co.uk/) (also a good pub), [Mother India](http://www.motherindia.co.uk/) (my favourite Glasgow restaurant), [Fratelli Sarti](http://fratelli-sarti.co.uk/) or the [Italian Kitchen](http://www.italian-kitchen.co.uk/). If you like a night out then this weekend I would recommend [Dopplereffekt at SWG3](http://www.swg3.tv/?p=9887), here's a [sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDCd6-aZvlw).

However i feels like winds are blowing towards using our current players at that role with a move for a healthy Rodriguez in January.....merits or flaws in this plan are neither here nor there for this thread so i will drop it.

For Mussachio i think that we would be getting a very talented and very smart CB who is suited to play in Poch's setup. This would give us a happy, committed Jan, an emerging Vlad and a talented Mussachio as our first 3 CB's with either a veteran in Kaboul (if we keep him) or Dier/Milos (if we let Kaboul go) earning stripes here and there for the season.

Given our annual injury crisis at CB i would be more than happy with this situation as it would give us a full backline that is suited to the manager's system even when we pick up injuries. Defending crosses/set pieces is a concern....but then again last season i found myself wincing about defending those even with Dawson on the pitch.  Plus we really struggled against the bigger teams who seemed less reliant on crossing to a target man to begin with in those matches we got shredded when our high line couldn't manage the positioning, with this we would have multiple CBs capable of doing so.

Which might be the case, since he's a lightning fast runner and he probably wasn't in the best of shape in the pre-season.

Depending on how badly he might have  injured his tendon he could be rehabilitating for a few more weeks to anywhere from 6 months. It takes a long time to heal due to the poor blood flow in all tendons in our bodies.

There's not a lot out there in terms of treatment. The conservative approach, building up muscles around the tendon to lessen the load will take the longest. But it's the most effective approach. There's a lot of experimental treatments with injecting either your own blood (PRP) or a sucrose solution (prolotherapy) straight into the tendon. Both of these treatments have had mixed results in the past but he would, for sure, be out for a few months with one of those treatments. 

Fear not, Cristiano Ronaldo has this issue too and probably has it far worse than Lazar. Cristiano was able to play in the World Cup, I noticed that his knee was taped up with KT tape and he most likely got cortisone injections before every match.

**EDIT:** Just read that Markovic will return to training next week.

He had a good season, but to me he had a good season in the right time in the right system with the right players. Excelled massively one year, but how will he be after the ACL? They say that's a 2 year thing also - you never recover the first year. Even Sandro is still a bit adamant and scared (THE BEAST) in 50/50's just in case his knee isn't strong.

I don't want him. I really don't want him. I can shortlist 5 players that are better, more ''getable'' and probably cheaper as no doubt we'll be held to ransom with Southamptons stance which I don't blame them. I would even rather Poch took Townsend to one side and focused intently on him rather than J Rod - he has the tools, he just can't use them. 

Mussachio...as long as we have 2 strong CM's, I'm okay with this I think. Worse case scenario is he plays well and Barca buy him from us and we make a bit of cash - but I'm still a bit scared he's too much like Vlad and we all agreed that wouldn't work. Like you said - especially against EPL/Physical/Route One teams - but hopefully Dier and Dawson/Kaboul or a replacement is around for those games. I would LOVE Naldo from Wolfsburg, he's 31 but can provide that experience, he's imposing, arguably one of the best CB's in Germany last year and just old enough for Dier to take over from him. But Jan is actually decent in the air, winning something like 70%+ of his Aerial duals and with strong, tall CM's we're good on set pieces. 

I would rather like you said get him in than have Dawson, Kaboul (who might play 5 games, maybe 10, maybe 15...you know) and Vlad with zero preseason so far and then Jan. So you're right - like you said too, our issue was the high line (shivers from the Pool game) and I feel that Musacchio WILL work in those games where teams play more on the ground and we can impose OUR system on them.

Where am I wrong exactly? I appreciate its not a happy story but your hardly giving much of a counter argument here. 

&gt;Your appalling grammar suggests you might benefit from university yourself.

Sigh... why do people think that. I'm not going to make out dyslexics are hard done to, but the level of bigotry on reddit about it especially is always fun.

Most of my, yes anecdotal experience comes from the 5 years I spent in Edinburgh University and my year now In Cardiff university. My experience of Oxford and Cambridge's accessibility comes from about 7 people I know, plus an ex-girlfriend who was from a VERY working class background (whom this situation badly fucked over -6k not being a trivial amount and her college absolutely would not budge on it).

Other examples to mind, are from the 40 or so people I know who went to Kings, UCL, LSE, Birmingham and Manchester. In nearly all these cases I can think of, outside of the handful doing Ph.d's (and making a pittance with bar one case, little chance of a reasonably paid post-doc position) nearly everyone is employed in the service industry. Only the comp sci grads, engineers and medics are the exception. Which is what one expects but unfortunately junks the social mobility purpose of the institutions - yes law is not included in this list the only sure way of a career path in that industry now being nepotocracy or sheer luck. 

Furthermore, my current course is full of people doing a conversion course in computing, after compiling B.Sc's in comp sci in various 'ex poly's in the south wales area, who employers will not touch with a barge pole. This should not be necessary. But it apparently is. 

Yes its anecdotal, but its fairly broad and it fits with sources like this which talk of the problem from other angles.

http://graduatefog.co.uk/2012/2203/graduates-underemployed/

I'm surprised this is even a controversial thesis if you've been to university in the last 5-6 years. Degree inflation is endemic, even in the technical training disciplines that are heavily in demand it is still a sellers market.

And so the culture in said universities, again mostly in the humanities, has largely become one of 'well this is a few years off to have a bit of fun, before I end of working in something totally irrelevant to my degree'.

And gradate schemes outside of STEM courses, are also. Aside from being a crap shoot, totally unrelated to the course almost all of the time and simply take uni graduates because of the perception they are 'generally smarter' not because of any inherent worth they perceive in the degree's. 

Edit: In fact, I know of a single person out of hundreds, who was not only from a distinctly working class background. But whom manged to then land a position from which his income allmost certaintly qualifies him as a middle class. 

Unless my experience, has been completely non-typical (which rationally is not something I have reason to believe) that puts the incidence rate of university actually functional as a mechanism of social mobility in the low single digits.

The whole makeup of the team defensively will be driven by having strong performers in the the 2 CM roles this will be the case against teams hoofing the ball up the pitch and ones walking it up.

* To find out council tax rates you'll be paying, google your local council and check out their website, they should have a breakdown of council tax bands and costs for your area, or you should be able to search the postcode of the property you're looking to move into and find out council tax cost for it.
* Note that the rate is per property, not per person.  If you're moving into a shared property then the monthly cost per person shouldn't be too much.
* Council tax bills are from one tax year to another, so April-April.  So the council tax bill you get when you move in will be the TOTAL annual bill from the date you move in until April of the following year (so for you, September-April probably).
* You do not pay CT every month.  You pay April-January every year, and get two months without paying.  At least if your bill is paid up to date.  So calculate your monthly payment by dividing the total bill by 10 months.
* Some properties used to include council tax or water rates or other expenses in the rent cost - very few do now that I've seen but it is a thing sometimes.  Check and find out exactly what is and isn't covered in the rent for any property you look at.  Remember even without council tax you need to cover two lots of water rates (one is for waste water and is often a different company), gas, electricity, phone line if there is one, TV license if you get one.  And always find out if the gas and electric is on a meter or paid monthly/quarterly.
* Some rent properties, especially low cost ones, have third party electric meters.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.  I was in one of those - I could ONLY buy electric credit from my landlord and the procedure for that was send a cheque for electricity, and WHEN IT WAS CASHED he'd send the credit in some disposable cards.  I regularly went 2-3 days without electric because he decided to bugger off on holiday and there was no one to sort it out for me.

Some do, some don't. I'd be 90% comfident your uni will have a careers advice service of sorts (probably joined to the union), they'll have loads of info. Keep your eyes and ears open and you'll probably see adverts for career fairs where you get to meet businesses that are looking for graduates in the upcoming recruitment cycle. Good opportunity to scope out companies and makes contacts. 

&gt; Do companies expect soon-to-be graduates to have relevant work experience? Basically, if all I have done is work in a shop, joined some clubs and volunteered a bit, would I even be considered?

Again some do, some don't. The students that think about employment earlier are typically the ones that sort out summer placements in more relevant industries etc... Not wanting to put you down too much, but usually its the more *driven* students that do this.. These are usually also the top achievers too... So ya know... 

&gt; Am I doomed if I don't get a decent conditional job offer in final year? Or can I build experience after university and apply to ""graduate"" jobs at a later stage?

Not at all. Most of my cohort graduated without conditional offers in place.. Just start applying when you're ready to rock.

&gt;In 2008 the *QI* format was sold to the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) broadcaster [VARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VARA_(broadcaster\)). Also called *[QI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI_(Dutch_version\))*, the Dutch version of the show aired for the first time on 27 December and was hosted by the writer [Arthur Japin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Japin) with the comedian Thomas van Luyn taking the role of regular panellist.   Japin also appeared (in the audience) in a British *QI* episode, explaining how the name [Vincent van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) should be pronounced. The series was discontinued after only 8 episodes.

&gt;A [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) version of *[QI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intresseklubben)* started airing on [SVT1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVT1) 8 September 2012, and is called *[Intresseklubben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intresseklubben)*. Comedian [Johan Wester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Wester) is hosting *Intresseklubben*, and [Anders Jansson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Jansson) is featured as the regular panellist.  A second series covering the letter B started airing in September 2013. 

&gt;In autumn 2013, the [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_republic) version of *[QI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI_(Czech_version\))* will start broadcasting on [TV Prima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Prima). The programme will be hosted by Leoš Mareš along with Patrik Hezucký.

Of course counter attacking is always a risk, but if we're playing a High Line having a imposing defender like Dawson won't matter anyway, and pace will be important. For set pieces we should be good with Capoue, Schneiderlin, Vertonghen wins over 3/4 of Aerial duals. Bentaleb is 6'2 IIRC too. And Hugo ain't that bad as a sweeper keeper either. His distrubtion won't matter too much if he has 2 technical DC's in Jan/Vlad/Musacchio in front of him either. If we're playing a high line and playing teams offside which is risky I'd rather have Jan/Musacchio/Vlad at the back than Kaboul/Dawson. They fit so much better in that system. And yup, I would like a option to have an imposing defender. We have Dier &amp; it's why I suggested Naldo - perhaps someone very experienced coming to the end of their careers, with enough to inspire and pass on their knowledge to Dier. Like Barzagli too. I don't feel Dawson is up to it anymore, and I don't think Kaboul can stay fit enough. Someone like a Naybet/Davids signing that changed us totally back in the day. Would be much cheaper too - it worked for Colombia - Yepes is THIRTY EIGHT. Yup, 38. And he was solid with Zapata - his experience made up for it. Did Van Buyten retire? I know his contract expired and he left Bayern. 

Like you said, the two CM roles are key. Capoue &amp; Schneiderlin are the 2 I think will offer that stability. Sadly, I don't see much place for Sandro (as he doesn't tend to drop back like Schenderlin did for Southampton), Dembele, Paulinho...which means we could sell 1 or 2 to strengthen elsewhere. It all depends - Paulinho may come back a man possessed. Just depends.

I bought one for a fiver once just to take apart to see the difference between that and a decent branded (Kanger) Ego battery and the difference was amazing. Crap soldering, a plastic tube instead of metal, thin wires haphazardly soldered.  The charger was no better, flimsy plastic thing that, when I took that apart, only had a few resistors inside so no ""intelligence"" of current limiting or voltage limiting.


If you're worried about charging batteries, you can easily and cheaply reduce the risk of anything getting out of hand with a LiPo fireproof charging bag. Pop your battery in there, put it somewhere sensible (not under the curtains, down the side of the sofa) and unplug when fully charged.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;You seem to have spent a lot of time and effort at something you believe isn't worth it, and that's a shame.

The philosophy degrees were, the computer science one is proving not to be. 

It's also not what i believe unfortunately, its my fairly extensive experience of the labour market. I trained for 5 years to write policy. When I left university, no such jobs existed. 

&gt;Your data, such as it is, seems to relate to the biggest recession since the 30s. Of course young graduates are poor, as are graduate students. But give it a few years and graduates will largely be doing better than non-graduates with otherwise similar backgrounds.

What reason do we have to believe this, why would a sociology, English or history degree increase in value? Especially when universities are constantly producing more people with these degree's?

&gt;I know working class people (Council estate, generally raised by a single parent on benefits) who are now; a publicist for an internationally famous orchestra; a VP at Apple; a successful Hollywood screenwriter; and many more.

And im guessing these people went to university some time ago, something in the region of &gt;= 10years? Before degree inflation had reached its current level?

Remember I never said it never was, I said it was not anymore. 

&gt;You can't judge the value of university by looking at people in their 20s.

The value of university, especially undergraduate degree's but unfortunately also postgraduate degree's is not just fixed in time and space, its defined by their prevalence in the labor market. 

If your just saying 'university == intelligence' . There is nothing that fundamentally makes you more learned or intelligent in any university course (especially with the low level of actual contact time, often as low as 6-10~ hours per week) that you could not simply acquire from being literate and self-motivated. 

Again remember, I also started off with a distinction between STEM degree's and everything else. We are talking about degree's like Economics and German or Business here. Not High performance computing. Unfortunately, my experience is that even degree's like Law and Pharmacology are suffering now as well. I also know about 6 Biologists who could not get work in their field after 2~ years of trying. 

And these days, maybe it was not the case in the time peroid your thinking of, even with technical degree's at times, if you do not enter the relevant part of the work force rapidly after graduation

I'm sorry but I think things have moved on significantly from what they were when your thinking of. University has been over-bloated to fuck, actual teaching is next to non-existent, and thousands of people with 2:1 / 1st degree's are pumped out into the labour market each year far exceeding demand. 

It's an incredibly crushing experience to go through and one that thousands and thousands of my generation are undergoing right now. ",0,1407507086,null,0,1407507411,0,cjki7lh,t3_2cxn5d,t1_cjki7lh,t1_cjki0nf,null,1435137002,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Thinking behind it is having an imposing CB there, with 2 ball playing/dribblers who can carry the ball forwards and also the technical ones pushing wide like Poch likes his CB's to do. That bulks up the backline if a Vlad/Jan, Jan/Musa partnership is too weak. 

That gives the 2 Full/Wing Backs playing high up some more support - Yedlin would be a good shout coming in for Walker in some games there too, same with Rose at LB who I always considered more of a winger. Kaboul/Strong CB can be a standard CB with Schneiderlin dropping back if shit hits the fan. Bentaleb is strong, and a good passer, almost like a MC playmaking role who can release the rushing wing backs, Eriksen, Lamela and Soldado. Eriksen can just be Eriksen, linking the midfield and attack floating around with the support behind him. Lamela fluid, playing a very advanced creative Treq/SS role with Soldado floating around finding space in the box created by Eriksen/Lamela drawing defenders away and the opposing full backs dealing with a different set up with the wing backs. 

Just experimental though and something to think about. Not likely to be something Poch would ever use or think about, but a fun way to look at a 3-5-2 with our squad and potential players nonetheless.

No, really not. Just because that's how we view it through nostalgia doesn't mean that's how it was. Mental health understanding was hideous back in the ""good old days"" and plenty of people suffered because of it. Racism and sexism were rife, opportunities for self-improvement were almost non-existent and quality of living was terrible. Do you have any idea how many babies died in infancy before the NHS? People got through it because they had to but don't think for a minute that they were upbeat about it.

There were no good old days. There was no time when cheery cockney chimney sweeps skipped their way to work. It doesn't take much to read between the lines when you talk about ""damaging changes in society"" that you're ""not allowed"" to speak up about. What you're really upset about is the fact that you can't say what you really think because people will judge you on it. Well too bad, actions have consequences. Here are the facts: life is better for the majority of people *because* of societal progress. For everyone who isn't a heterosexual white Christian man, life is unquestionably better. For heterosexual white Christian men, life is no worse. Deal with it.

They may allow this, in which case you will need to wait a good month or two until the files are updated.


Failing this, there are three credit reference agencies; Experian, Equifax, and Call Credit. If you want to dispute the debt, or explain the situation, you can contact each and ask to put a ""notice of correction"" on the report. This will flag with any future credit reference check and, if operated by a human, may be considered.

Chances are, in this case, you will probably need to wait at least two months, more likely six months to a year. The further back a default is, the less importance it is viewed with.

-Because of this ^ its very demanding for the players in terms of fitness.

-Specific to his vision with Spurs, he wants to build back to front as his system requires defenders comfortable in a high line. 

-His attack consists of three attacking mids, all of which interchange freely throughout the course of the game - attempting to find ways to support a lone striker.

-In addition he plays two deep-lying midfielders, one of which will be more of a playmaker - the other will be a more of a stopper. They will help link play to the attacking mids.

-Fullbacks will be given freedom to roam forward, so the deep-lying mids need to be ready to step back and cover for them.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"I'll give you the anecdotal. My mother was from the USSR, my father a local. Their progeny (myself included) went on to educate themselves and possess relatively high paying jobs in fields that are under-represented in most industries (computer science). We contribute to the UK economy and wholly identify ourselves as English.

What you have to bear in mind when discussing immigration is there are all sorts of immigration but people just focus on some family from Solihull that don't speak English or integrate... they're a minority. Its worth noting that whenever people complain about immigration they are genuinely debating my own existence and in some cases saying its a bad thing, I find this intolerable.  

.... and fuck the:

&gt; oh well we're not talking about you, your dad's English, that's fine  

As soon as you start cutting down on immigration you kill off future mes..... moreover I've had a lot of friends growing up from immigrant families. I did a paper round for an Indian newsagent and the guy who ran it was always on top form despite his shitty English, his children we're full on Brit:  

&gt; I don't want to take over the family business, I want to go backpacking round Australia  

I used to play chess and smoke weed with the Indian Postmaster (guy who ran the post office) which is where I formed my love for playing The King's Gambit.  
I was babysat by a Pakistani family often when my Mum was at work and this was the first time I'd played on the classic console: the Vic20 and sparked my love of computers and games.  

As I was growing up I got heavily into dance and rocked with a dance crew that had people from Zambia, Jamaica and the Philippines. We rocked this country and won a ton of major events.

It's all entwined and I genuinely think that people who hate on immigration don't actually appreciate how much its ingrained in our society. If there was a badge for anyone who was the product of immigration or had been positively influenced by it then I think people would find it harder to hate because they would see that badge _everywhere_ and on a _huge_ number of Caucasians.  

So please, please, please don't reduce this argument to the family in Solihull who don't integrate the language and don't care about the country. The real subject is so deep and complex that its impossible to make a blanket statement like:  

&gt; Immigration impacts the economy negatively  

You cannot count up everyone's story to find out if that's genuinely truthy or not. The facts and figures are fun indicators but they can't capture humans and human interaction which is what this subject is at its essence.

Yup. [Here's a good write up](http://www.thetottenhamway.com/2014/08/03/pochs-pre-season-detailed-tactical-analysis-spurs-6-1-celtic/)

I was so taken aback by our pressing v Celtic ''reserves''. They couldn't get the ball out their half unless they hoof'd it up the field. Even 4 5 up 80th minute and we're chasing the ball down while 2 others are closing the passing lanes. If you watch the game you see lots of that - one goal came from what seemed a lost cause that Lennon closed down. Reminded me a lot of Barca's 6 second rule and geggenpressing - just overloading one side of the pitch all the time. 

Also, something good to add is Poch works the players hard. Double training sessions, he really works them as opposed to ''just run around Arry, and boring AVB and Tactics Tim''. Which is fucking awesome. Also (maybe just due to Debt) bought so many players through the Youth System at Espanyol, gave 10 players first team debuts in his short time and IIRC it was like 20 players at one point from the Youth system featuring or on the bench? Have to google that to confirm. 

I would write something on someone of our players, I've done some on Youth but I doubt they'll feature too much (I really hope so though). So someone else can do that - plenty more eloquent than I am. ",0,1407508410,null,0,1407508685,0,cjkite8,t3_2czb2l,t1_cjkite8,t1_cjkihkd,null,1435137250,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,bottomlines,null,null,"Immigration as a whole is ok. However, there are a few main problems

1) Increased competition for low-skilled jobs. This has meant that a lot of poorer Brits have been left out on their arse with no real solution. Benefits aren't great, and it's not sustainable to ""prop up"" so many people long-term. It's very hard to re-train from a low-skilled job when you are made redundant in your 40's.

2) It makes the barrier to entry much higher for young people. This may be good for ""the economy"" (like GDP), but if you are a 16-21yr old British person without good qualifications, you are pretty much fucked. You are easily outcompeted by people from overseas. I'm not saying Brits should be guaranteed jobs because they were born here, but this is another problem which is very hard to deal with.

3) Cultural problems. This one will likely get me downvoted. Some immigrants contribute. Others, a significant number, are fucking arseholes. They bring horrible cultures, traditions and beliefs with them. They often move into the same area as the others from their background, forming a kind of ghetto where the people there originally start to feel like strangers. They raise their children with beliefs that are not in line with British values. 

I hate to do it, but I'm going to quote Nigel Farage. He was correct that immigration is not just about the economic effects. It's about how people FEEL about the country. And people simply don't like large numbers of strangers who look different, talk different etc moving into their area. I don't think that's really xenophobia - it's pretty much natural. For people who have lived in an area and suddenly see street signs in arabic, translators in the council office, their GP surgery full of people in saris - they feel angry and abandoned. That's why we are seeing some backlash against immigration now. That's likely where someone like your mum gets her viewpoint. Something silly like the couple on Nick &amp; Margarets BBC documentary. They singled out that their local shops had all sorts of weird ethnic vegetables and spices in it that they didn't understand. It's ridiculous, but I do understand how they feel. People feel alienated and simply don't like rapid change.

As far as expectations go, I believe the general consensus on here is an expected 5th or 6th place finish with a deep cup run, especially in the Europa League, as the winner gets a Champions League spot.

Key players:

**Lloris** - In my opinion the best player on the team and arguably one of the best goalkeepers in the world. His sweeping will be of massive importance to Poch's high press system.

**Eriksen** - Voted by fans as the player of the season last year and was one of the few glimmers of hope from a terrible season. 

Players to watch for:

**Lamela** - He's coming off of an injury-filled season and has looked healthy and confident this preseason. I expect him to show why he's the record transfer this season and thrive under Poch.

**Capoue** - Based on preseason, it looks like he will play a very important role in the team this year. Good on the ball and great in defense, could be the anchor to our midfield.

These are just my opinions, so take them as that. I'm sure there are other people that can give a much better write-up about this kind of stuff.",0,1407509087,null,0,false,0,cjkj55w,t3_2czb2l,t1_cjkj55w,t3_2czb2l,null,1435137380,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

That took balls to do. 

If you look at the manifesto they had 4 main priorities on the front cover and which they spoke about endlessly in the run up to 2010, with the exception of a fairer voting system (which failed in a referendum), they have honoured those pledges. There have also been a number of independent studies which shows a greater number of LibDem manifesto commitments have been enacted then conservative ones. 

The tuition fee debacle is a long debate but I think we can all agree that they should never have made the pledge. It is worth remembering that both Labour and the Conservatives were determined to remove the cap altogether and were not as concerned about improving the loan system and making it reflect circumstances.

I can think of nobody better to embody the antithesis of Fellaini than Coutinho. He was my favorite player to watch last year. I can't take my eyes off of him. He seems to have an endless flow of ideas and while he doesn't always connect, he has the ability to pull of anything he tries. He pressured opponents furiously and won a lot of balls for us with his tackling. His vision is top notch and his passing is eye catching, creative, and is second only to Gerrard (who can play some of the most perfect balls I've seen). He does have a bit of a tendency to get lost in a game, but I think that might come from the fact that he is so young and is very much continuing to develop. This is an exciting thought because it means he can get even better.

I think of all our players, with the possible exception of Sterling, he's who I'm most excited to watch this season. NEXT WEEKEND!!",0,1407509416,null,0,false,0,cjkjays,t3_2cz7sb,t1_cjkjays,t3_2cz7sb,null,1435137409,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Erik Lamela - After an injury-riddled campaign that saw him miss almost the entire second half of the year, Lamela has looked reinvigorated under new manager Pochettino, and seems ready to regain the form that saw him become Tottenham’s record signing.

Christian Eriksen - Consistently one of our best players last year, Eriksen’s adjustments to Pochettino’s system will be key to Tottenham’s success this year as he continues to develop.

Hugo Lloris – One of the lynchpins of AVB's high-line plans, it will be important that Lloris is able to quickly adjust to a new manager, new system, and new coaches after leading France into the Quarterfinals of the World Cup.

Head Coach 
Mauricio Pochettino

Coming off of a successful 17-month spell at Southampton, the former Argentina, Espanyol and Newell's Old Boys Center-Half brings a high-intensity “Bielsa-ista” system to Tottenham Hotspur. Pochettino's teams like to press high up the field, attempting to win the ball back quickly before playing high-risk, high-reward vertical passes towards the attacking players. His team last year at Southampton had impressive possession statistics, and he has said he wants his new team at Spurs to play with flair and style; He recently told reporters, “Always the result is important but just as important is the ride you take to get to the result”. Obviously, Pochettino's chief concern will be getting Spurs back into the Champion's League, which for the first time can be a two-pronged campaign, as Tottenham can qualify either by finishing 4th or better, or by winning the UEFA Europa League, a competition Pochettino has said he will take seriously. With last summer's signing Erik Lamela seemingly regaining the form that saw Tottenham buy him from AS Roma for a club record fee, as well as renewed health for key contributors Kyle Walker, Etienne Capoue, and Sandro, and new signings Ben Davies and Michel Vorm bolstering the defense, expectations surrounding Pochettino and Tottenham are high heading into the new campaign.",0,1407509539,null,0,false,0,cjkjd68,t3_2czb2l,t1_cjkjd68,t3_2czb2l,null,1435137432,13,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,13

If City subscribe to the ""two of every position"" mindset, then having both Fernando and Javi is good. Plus, Fernando has still never played in England. Garcia has adapted to the game. It's quite possible Fernando suffers a bit of transition time. Fernandinho still regaining fitness from the WC.

There are a handful of people with 10, 20 or more offences to their name. It's very rare that a burglar has only burgled one house. It's very rare that a mugger has only mugged one person in their life.

**There is absolutely NO excuse to have a list of 10+ offences to your name.** That represents a shocking failure of the system on every level. Primarily, why are you continuing to commit so much frequent crime (drug addiction, boredom, whatever)? Secondly, if you were going to re-offend, why were you able to get out of jail? 

Why do we have a system where a burglar is sent to prison for a short time, but the judge doing the sentencing absolutely KNOWS 100% that that person is going to do it again? That seems pretty fucking retarded to me.

I would propose some sort of extended, massive sentencing for repeat, habitual offenders. It's not right that some shithead can destroy the lives of potentially hundreds of people and be able to keep doing so. I've been burgled before and it was a really horrible experience.

No, i've been quite clear that the issue is that the degree's are adding nothing to their employability in the vast range of cases and in the screaming majority of cases is completely irrelevant to their vocation, which is again, almost always unskilled service industry of some description (and im not just talking about flipping burgers or stacking shelves). It's got nothing to do with wealth now or income now, and its gross misinterpration or obscurification to suggest otherwise, i'm talking about how much a degree has enhanced or in this case restricted their autonomy in setting out their career paths. 

If your just going to dismiss the value added to a persons ability to negotiate their place in in the labor market conferred by time spent in an institution as irrelevant to what someones 'class' might be, given class is properly defined as least as relation to income and thus power in society. Then what the fuck is your point exactly? I'm wrong your right?


Listen if you can't be fucked to properly engage in a debate, cool. this is the internet. Just cut the smug 'well I know better shit', when your not bringing anything to the table to demonstrate that, all your doing is dismissing my experiences are irrelevant. As opposed to -as i'd hope a rational person might - considering 'ah shit... maybe things have changed'.

Anyway, continue to be a dimissive idiot if you wish, it's clear your not going to consider anything but your own limited experience as proof of anything. But as i've said, barring some demonstration that my own experience is radically outside of the norm, the case very well may be that things have changed in the last decade that have seriously undermined university as a tool of social mobility.

If you want to eat out, quite a few chain restraints do gluten free stuff and you will often be fine with steak houses and fancy burger places but not always. 

Nandos and  McDonalds can do gf is you specify it and don't have the bread.

Pizza Hut have a gf base which is pretty good!

Wheathespoons pubs also show gluten free stuff on their menus although the choice isn't great. 

La Favorita (really good Italian place on Leith Walk) advertise gluten free pasta and pizza although I've never actually had if. I assume it's probably good though since everything else there is delicious.

There are also definitely a few Chinese places which can do gf stuff although I can't remember names. I'm sure google will help!

Waitrose do gf sandwiches although that's not a lot of use since the only Waitrose is in Morningside.

As for brands and stuff, Tesco is your best bet for choice although Sainsburys also have plenty. 

Genius bread is by far the best that I've found - seeded load is really delicious.

This has meant that a lot of poorer Brits have been left out on their arse with no real solution. Benefits aren't great, and it's not sustainable to ""prop up"" so many people long-term. It's very hard to re-train from a low-skilled job when you are made redundant in your 40's.

Just a note to say that unemployment claimants are actually quite low at the moment.  They decreased significantly during the Labour government, so even though they doubled during the financial crisis, they're still lower than in most of the 80s.  Of course the gap between claimants and job seekers has increased.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Do companies reach out to universities to let them know they are looking for soon-to-be graduates to apply?

Some do, some don't. Your university will almost certainly have a careers fair in the autumn term - this is a great way to get information on employers who are targeting graduates and also to find suitable careers which you hadn't considered before. These companies will be mainly large or local to the uni, so you still need to do online research.

As a warning, these fairs will be absolutely packed full of students, so don't go in wearing a suit or you'll toast, and be prepared to wait for a few minutes before talking to someone. And make sure you do talk to someone rather than just getting a brochure and a free pen - you'll get far more useful information.

&gt; Do companies expect soon-to-be graduates to have relevant work experience? Basically, if all I have done is work in a shop, joined some clubs and volunteered a bit, would I even be considered?

Depends on the company. Of course, if you're looking at graduate training schemes (which you probably are), the key word is *training*. They don't expect you to be able to come in and do everything a normal employee could straight away. There are of course some businesses where having done a placement is almost expected (engineering springs to mind), but with most your job history won't be a problem.

Of course, that said, having done an internship will only help your chances.

&gt; Am I doomed if I don't get a decent conditional job offer in final year? Or can I build experience after university and apply to ""graduate"" jobs at a later stage?

Not at all. I'm starting in September after graduating in July, and I didn't have anything lined up when I finished uni (and I don't have any prior job experience either). That said, having a conditional offer lined up will make your final months of uni a lot less stressful; it's not nice to have the uncertainty of what's going to happen next hanging over you.

My advice is to start looking at potential careers now, and get an idea of what you want to do. A lot of graduate training schemes for big companies will close applications in mid-November, so try to get applications in well before then. That's not to say there won't be anything available after then, so if you don't have anything sorted by then, don't worry - just keep applying.

A lot of graduate training schemes will accept people who graduated a few years before, but you'll need to be able to tell them what you've been doing since you graduated, and why you did it. Something like a 12 or 18 month placement can be a good thing to do if you can't get a permanent role, although these are still competitive.

The one thing I would say that you shouldn't do is apply to a ridiculous number of jobs at once - make sure your applications are focused and of a high quality, and tailored to the job you're applying for.

At the very least, the whole place should be unified into one country, with equal rights for the indiginous people, the palestinians, in exchange for disarmament and disbandment of Hamas. Even the USA eventually gave that to the native americans.

The truth is, the Jews in Israel believe they are a superior race, chosen by god. Racism is baked right into their culture. So they see nothing wrong with the ethnic cleansing of Palestine.

&gt;

&gt;The __2014–15 UEFA Europa League__ is the 44th season of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)'s secondary club [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) tournament organised by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA), and the 6th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League).

&gt;The [2015 UEFA Europa League Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_UEFA_Europa_League_Final) will be played at the [Stadion Narodowy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stadium,_Warsaw) in [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw), Poland.  [Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC) are the title holders.

&gt;This will be the first season where clubs must comply with [UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations) in order to participate.  Moreover, this season was the first where a club from [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) competed in the tournament, after the [Gibraltar Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_Football_Association) was accepted as the 54th UEFA member at the UEFA Congress in May 2013.  They were granted one spot in the Europa League,  which was taken by [College Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Europa_FC), the runners-up of the [2014 Rock Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Rock_Cup).

true,gomez12,null,null,"Good for NICE. Good job not being bullies by the drug companies.

I work in this area, so maybe I can provide some useful opinion. This is a latest generation antibody-drug conjugate (basically a guided drug, using a specific antibody to target to tumours). It's an awesome technology which will hopefully result in highly targeted anti-cancer drug delivery. Part of the reason why chemo is so terrible is because it affects all sorts of cells in the body, and not just the cancer cells. This family of drugs specifically target certain cancers. So in theory, one day in the future you may get cancer, it can be genetically profile and then you will get the exact drug you need coupled to an antibody which delivers it to ONLY the tumour and nothing else. You could have almost no side effects. 

As a result

1) These drugs are incredibly expensive to design, test and manufacture. They are highly complex. The cost will not really come down unless we loosen the standards for drug testing, safety analysis and manufacture.

2) The market for these drugs is actually quite small. Antibodies are highly specific, but cancers are very very different to each other. It seems to be that there is no specific target that is generic to every cancer cell. That means that 100 difference cancers might need 100 different drugs. And each drug needs the same R&amp;D, safety analysis, manufacturing scrutiny etc. From the drug companies point of view, it would be better to release another generic (but less effective) anti-cancer drug which can kill lots of cancers. Then it's only one drug and one set of expenses.

So there's a balance to be had. Clearly 90 grand is an outrageous sum of money for a few extra months of life (which is not guaranteed of course). But IMO it's also very impressive that such a drug exists in the first place. These companies do need to be able to make profit in order to continue developing more drugs - especially with newer technologies like this one. If nobody can (or will) pay for it, we do risk stifling drug discovery. 

I'm not saying we should feel sorry for Roche or worry that they are not making enough money. Rather, they will design drugs according to the market for selling them. If it happens that targeted drugs for breast cancer simply becomes unprofitable, they will focus on something else which might be less ""important"" but more profitable. A single penis enlargement pill would make more money than 100 highly targeted anti-cancer drugs. Therefore we do need there to be sufficient financial incentive for companies to keep tackling very difficult areas such as cancer.",0,1407512777,null,0,false,0,cjkl1iy,t3_2cytpk,t1_cjkl1iy,t3_2cytpk,null,1435138337,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think with Bale it was weird. I genuinely think his technique is overrated, like he's not a dribbler per se - he was just extremely confident and he's a freak athlete. If he has no space, and no room to get a shot away, he's limited. Once he hit that confidence he would just *try* things that others wouldn't, but could have. And now he's 85m Bale, up there as one of the worlds best. Maybe it's cuz I remember ''old Bale'' when he was younger. I still am surprised he went for like a world record fee considering I remember him drifting out of games for 80 minutes then slamming in a 20 yard goal and it's MotM Bale. 

That might be ''downplaying'' Bale, but he never struck me as one of those tricky, genuinely creative types - he was more Toe Poke - Smash through 2 defenders - Score. Even his amazing goal for Real v Barca was the most typical awkward Bale style finish. I'd obviously take him back in a heartbeat, but I think his technical/creative side is inferior to Lamela.

Lamela isn't far off athletically either. He's bulking up (minus the semi-homo Instagram pic) He was the quickest over 1000m for Roma, actually had a pretty insane time too 2' 49 and the world record is like 2' 11 IIRC? He's got the same height, so a similar sprint style and he's deceptively strong too - I've seen him shrug off strong DM's in Italy and also for us (v Villa he swatted Sylla away like he's nothing). I think Lamela just needs that confidence now - that ''i'm gonna fucking smash this in and it will go in'' mentality which he sounds like he's getting. Plus, with a point to prove he might be even more than a handful.

Police used a Taser in the arrest of an armed man who had taken another man hostage in the penthouse restaurant of the Meridian Tower in Swansea. 

Officers confirmed a handgun had been recovered from the scene and a local man was in custody.

The ""hostage situation"" was brought to an end by police who used the Taser to subdue the armed man after two hours.

Nobody was seriously injured in the incident at the tower, Wales' tallest building, which began at 16:00 BST. ",0,1407515148,null,0,1407524486,0,cjkmc3a,t3_2czp04,t1_cjkmc3a,t3_2czp04,null,1435138956,8,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,8

This is becoming a big problem too in that the original models of ego, a popular and when genuine, good quality ecigarette battery use a charger that can just as easily be attached to everything else on sale that doesn't necessarily charge in the same way.  Any manufacturer with sense would make their product resistant to incorrect charger connection etc. but then that's possibly a big ask when some of this stuff is produced so cheaply.  Who knows how a device will react to power in the wrong end or at the wrong current etc.

Cheap ac-dc adapters from china are hardly rare, anyone interested in the difference should take a look at mikeselectricalstuff on youtube, he has a good teardown of a real vs fake apple charger.  If a dodgy factory can shave a few cents off the price by using a shitty design or poor quality component they're going to do so given that despite regulations on the importation of unsafe electrical goods these things are everywhere and when they do go wrong it's to some poor sucker on the opposite side of the world with no consequence to the manufacturer.


If you want to try an ecig then avoid the very cheapest stuff, try and find a genuine ego battery or a genuine device from the likes of innokin etc.  Fakes are everywhere, stick to established online retailers who have a reputation to lose and not some shop that pops up overnight in a shopping centre.

And very importantly don't leave li-ion batteries charging unattended, the temptation is to just leave one charging constantly for a heavy user but if they overcharge it can all go very wrong.  The bigger batteries require even more care, stick to specs if you're dabbling in more advanced ecig setups and don't overstress them.

For those of you who don't know, this small privately-owned cosmetics shop has become the camping ground for a group of [pro-Palestinian ""boycotters""](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-palestine-israeli-protesters-clash-7492504). (I use the quotations because I doubt any of them would have bought from the Kedem shop anyway. I myself, despite being Jewish and a regular buyer of Kedem wine had no idea that the company even sold cosmetics, let alone had a store in my home town).

Anyway, my mum decided she wanted to stop by the shop and maybe buy something because, gentle soul she is, she feels bad for the owners [who feel terrorized](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/aug/07/shop-workers-in-manchester-say-they-are-intimidated-by-pro-palestinian-protesters) by the constant presence of the loud, intimidating crowd.

The police were out in force to ensure that there were no hostilities. Thankfully, while I was there, it was moderately peaceful. The pro-Palestinian side were chanting, waving threatening placards, comparing British citizens to Hitler, etc. The pro-Israel side were standing guard in front of the shop, generally being quiet aside from singing in Hebrew and the occasional young hot-blooded man shouting abuse back over. So my mum quite rightly asked a policeman how this is allowed to happen on the streets of Manchester. A previously quiet and peaceful street is being disrupted. A group of Jews are having to take time out of their week to defend the shop from rioters.

What makes you say that? I was under the impression prolific offenders would get longer sentences, and when first time offenders do get prison sentences, they would be short.

edit: also, why does it matter if the person is a repeat offender. The fact is they've come out of prison and committed a crime - whether they've been in prison once or one hundred times makes no difference to the point that a lot of people re-offend after prison?

There are very few countries where you can get away with thinking doing and behaving differently or controversially as you can in Britain (aka, freedom, equality etc). There are very few places as stable and peaceful as Britain.

Sure, for all of those things, you can point to some other European countries. But for most things that matter to me personally, Britain is normally right up there in the top 10 countries in the world. Considering there are some 250+ countries out there, placing *at least* 5 billion people ""below"" us, we're doing pretty good - we punch well above our weight in many metrics.

You may not have chosen to be British, but like it or not, you're part of what makes Britain so great, so I see no reason why you shouldn't be proud and patriotic!

&gt; Some employers and employment agencies may say that your hourly rate of pay includes an amount for holiday pay, and that they expect you to save this part of your pay to cover your holidays. This is known as 'rolled up' holiday pay. Rolled up holiday pay may be against the law **unless your holiday pay is paid on top of your basic pay and it's clear what the amount of rolled up holiday pay is. For example, the amount of rolled up holiday pay should be clearly set out in your payslip.**

The bold is mine. My holiday pay is a seperate line on my pay slip, as I explained in my original comment, and my base pay is the same as permanent full time employees at the same level as me. So everything's above board and legal :)

In all honesty, 99% of most promising wonderkids would've crumbled under the pressure he was put under during his ""streak"" and general rubbish-ness at LB for us but he persevered and got himself into the squad albeit at a different position. He has flashes of good technique (in terms of dribbling) but he's definitely not near Lamela in that respect like you said. I was merely saying that if Lamela is anywhere near Bale was mentally during his blossoming years for us, we're in for a treat because the lad was something else.

Now onto Lamela, the thing that bothered me last season about him wasn't the fact that he didn't light it up in terms of goals/assists or whatever. It was the fact that he almost refused to take players on and show his skill. I wasn't expecting him to slide into our XI and bang em in left and right, but he disappointed me for the most part (disregarding the Villa and Sheriff matches, the latter more so than the former). However, as we've seen in this preseason, he's taking players on, ripping shots from 20-30m out and just generally looking more fluid on the pitch instead being just another relatively stationary passing target. 

People have been saying that he'll be the Premier League's surprise of the season, but how can he be a surprise when the quality's always been there?

Germany has, as /u/atyon pointed out, a similar show ([Genial daneben](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genial_daneben)), just not as good in his opinion.

Besler was sitting on a yellow from the previous game and Costa Rica was still salty about losing when they played in the USA, so Campbell did this to try and get Besler to sit out the next game (against Mexico).

true,Froolow,null,null,"I don't know whether he is joking, but there's at least a respectable case to be made for a strongly funded public pharmaceutical sector.

The best argument for it is that is solves coordination problems. You might have read what a problem antibiotic resistance is going to be in the future when pathogens evolve a resistance to the current antibiotics we have and there's nothing to replace them. Part of the problem is that drugs companies who might do research into antibiotics have to currently compete with cheap-as-chips generic alternatives, so no research is done. A public pharma company could solve this coordination problem by spending money 'intelligently' rather than just trying to lead the market. (This also solves another huge problem where companies fail to innovate and instead produce 'me too' drugs which offer - at best - a marginal improvement over what is already on the market and wastes resources so doing)

It would also solve a problem where companies try to game the system by not seeking licenses for drugs which would take market share from other drugs they own (see, for example the Lucentis / Avastin for wAMD debaticle), or game the system by setting up misleading trials or obscuring data on a drug's efficacy; with all this information in the public domain thanks to FoI requests 'all bugs become shallow' and any potential flaws are identified much quicker.

It also solves a philosophical issue of research funding - since the UK government pays for a huge amount of UK pharma research (both in terms of research grants directly and training the next generation of pharmaceutical scientists at university), why should the UK taxpayer have to pay twice to access the fruits of this research when productised by a private company? Moreover a common argument by pharma companies in this kind of situation is that the government should pay a premium for 'innovative' products, to encourage companies to keep investing in basic research and long-shot cures. Why pay a premium in the first place if we can invest directly into researching those long-shot cures? As a bonus the drugs can then be sold at cost into the NHS which cuts out a layer of otherwise totally pointless bureaucracy in both the NHS and the pharma company and therefore (slightly) lowers taxes.  

The obvious downsides are that the government doesn't have a history of operating in this sector, so we don't know if it would work (although the government is super efficient when it gets involved in the tech sector so I reckon it would probably do OK) and there is a danger of the direction of the public pharma company being hijacked by special interest groups (e.g. The government bowing to pressure to research more into cancer and less into depression, because cancer is 'sexier'). Also, we'd still have to buy a lot of drugs from the Yanks / Swiss anyway, and for various reasons it isn't a good idea to rip off their intellectual property even if we could, so there's a good chance we'd still have to accept we'd be in a mixed economy where companies like Roche will try to gouge the NHS for a drug they have the exclusive rights on.",0,1407519691,null,0,1407520046,0,cjkou17,t3_2cz4kk,t1_cjkou17,t1_cjkm6el,null,1435140181,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

There are bits and pieces of ITK that are accurate but there is a shitload that is absolute garbage.  Its the nature of what it is.

You can get ITK its not that hard really, Spurs are an employer like anyone else and like any other employer there is talk around the workplace....just talk around the workplace at Spurs MAY (not guaranteed) involve players....but is still mainly going to revolve around inter-office bs (Nancy is sleeping with Jim in accounting etc).  If you know someone you may get some of this talk.

Problem is very few people are going to be talking to someone nearly enough to keep pace with how a transfer develops.

I am friends with a guy who has gotten ITK before, he isn't anyone special...he is a season ticket holder for 30+ years (his seats are disgustingly close to the director's box, the fucker) and he does a great deal of charity work, on more the a few occasions he was worked with Spurs....so he knows a few people, now in ""ITK world"" this would mean that he could call them every hour on the hour and get updates on a deal and obviously the people he knows would tell him everything.....in the real world he has a wife, 6 kids, (4 of whom are under the age of 15, 2 of whom are married and have kids of their own, he and his wife often babysit for them) he has a full time job that he has to commute over and hour each direction to, he has a home he has to maintain, school/kids/football events he has to take care of, then he has his work with charity and then he has Spurs....so he isnt' going to be calling anyone every hour to get updates....he doesn't have time to do so....so the rare occasions that someone passes a bit of information to him the odds are he wouldn't have time to actually get an update to it until it was announced anyways.

I think a great deal of ""ITK"", if they are actually valid, fall into a scenario like this....they may get a piece of information but they are in no position to follow up on it to get updates.  

That is why a journo can get the story, they get a piece of information and they can then spend however the hell long they need to reaching out to sources in the club, an agent, or the other club to get information.  It's their job to find these stories and chase them....its ITKs job to be an estate agent, a call centre manager, a banker or a bartender and if they happen to get information from someone reliable enough odds are they won't get another chance to ask about the story until they happen to be in the same place at the same time be that a day, a week or months later.

ITK can be entertaining though, not a whole lot different than people on here throwing out names.....just not something to swear by in any stretch of the imagination.",0,1407519902,null,0,1407520089,0,cjkoy86,t3_2czmat,t1_cjkoy86,t1_cjknss3,null,1435140248,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

You know you can control the game without the ball? In fact it is one of Mourinho's key rules on how to defeat attacking teams. According to recent biography on him by diego Torres anyhow, this is his strategy:

1. The game is won by the team who commits fewer errors
2. Football favours whoever provokes more errors in the opposition
3. Away from home, instead of trying to be superior to the opposition, it's better to encourage their mistakes
4. Whoever has the ball is more likely to make a mistake
5. Whoever renounces possession reduces the possibility of making a mistake
6. Whoever has the ball has fear
7. Whoever does not have it is therefore stronger.

Sounds familiar to what happened.

The slip happened because we were pushing way to high up the pitch taking the game to Chelsea when we didn't need to.

&gt; Chelsea weren't threatening going forwards at all and never would have been.

Apart from when they scored twice.

&gt; Time wasting from the first whistle.

They used every trick in the book to get the result they wanted. Shankly would have been impressed. If you think the only successful way to utilise tactics is to keep the ball and attempt to win the game openhanded then you are missing a whole other dimension to the game. Did you miss Suarez bending the rules as far as they can go all last season?

&gt; If thats Jose's tactical genius

All those elements were his game plan. It didn't happen by accident. His players were drilled to time-waste and soak up from the first whistle. The fact they carried out Mourinho's tactics so efficiently is testament to his ability as a coach. 27% possession they had in the game and they won 0-2.",0,1407520472,null,0,false,0,cjkp9im,t3_2cy92e,t1_cjkp9im,t1_cjkoh5t,null,1435140404,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;was the fact that he almost refused to take players on and show his skill

I think this is two things.

1. Confidence. I think confidence makes so much difference in a player. Once Bale turned into his gay Ronaldo clone (little side parting, wearing ugly ass caps and button up shirts) he hit that peak of his confidence where he would try things. Take the goal at say...shit, I forget...Swansea. [Thats it. Jan plays him in, he controls it then quickly toe pokes it into the net from about 20 yards.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UhBHnI8-I) He was a hard working Welsh lad, always put in a shift - but soon as he believed he was ''one of the best'', that's when he tried shit and it paid off. Lamela could do that with his eyes closed, but it's all about having the confidence. Lamela now in that same situation would have received the pass from Jan, used his strength and held the ball up, waited for a pass - you know? Not that it would have been a bad decision, but he needs that confidence to ''go to alone''. 

2. I think Lamela is more a AMC. He is LETHAL taking players on in his Roma days when he's central. I know he fits as a AMR really well, and he does have a nice controlled curved shot on him (you may remember the goal, v Torino I think). He just controls it, side foot, beautiful. But, he's not a traditional inside forward. He's like a AMC that's played out wide for Totti's sake, and then came to us as a Bale replacement. You'll notice that he'll pick it up - have one guy coming for him and rather than try beat him, he'll look inside for the pass or drift inside rather than challenging him. 

Hopefully that ties in with the confidence thing, cuz I saw him do TONS of Bale-esque moments at Roma showing his insane speed, strength and technique. One run I remember he picked it up deep in his half, collided with a player who just collapsed next to him, sprinted in field past 2/3 players and played a great ball in the end. If he had that Bale confidence? He'd have smashed it in I have no doubt about it. It just seems to me that his mind is a creative playmaker over a goalscorer - which is odd with 15 goals and 5 assists. But he'll always weigh up his passing options till the last second which sometimes, if he'd just smashed it in which I've seen him do for Roma - we'd be saying ''the second coming of BALE!'' I'll edit with the clip. 

[Here it is. Watch the run man...he takes the shot too late as he waits for options. Then, next clip at around 0.49 he makes the pass, but full of confidence I AM THE MAN Lamela should have smashed that](http://youtu.be/dxLT9LwgLrg?t=25s)

The whole thing is worth watching, this is the first minute but it highlights my point. 3.04 on that video is another great example of him in full stride turning on the afterburners, just like Bale did. 

[And he can also shoot like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eU2Ns8DNwc)",0,1407522626,null,0,1407523544,0,cjkqgvs,t3_2cyvnt,t1_cjkqgvs,t1_cjko50r,null,1435140895,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

&gt; Meridian Tower incident resolved peacefully

&gt; South Wales Police can confirm that a hostage situation on the twenty-eighth floor of the Meridian Tower in Swansea Marina, has ended peacefully with no serious injuries.

&gt;  Officers were called to the building at 4pm on Friday, 8 August, after a man was taken hostage inside a public area of the building, by another man who was in possession of a firearm.

&gt;  Specialist resources were dispatched to the scene, including the police helicopter, armed response officers, and a trained police negotiator.

&gt; After approximately two hours, a tactical response team discharged taser to subdue the man and detain him. A handgun has been recovered from the scene.

&gt; Nobody was seriously injured as a result of the incident.

&gt; The public are thanked for their co-operation after road closures at the base of Meridian Tower caused some disruption.

&gt;  Superintendent Andy Kingdom, said: “Thankfully this very serious incident ended peacefully with no injuries to anyone involved.
&gt;  “I’d like to thank my officers for the bravery and professionalism they showed during what was a very tense situation.

&gt; “I’d also like to thank the public for the co-operation they have shown throughout.”

Gerrard is my favorite for obvious reasons. Sturridge is also up there because he's so good, and he's also really personable and is a great guy. Henderson the same really.

Indeed. You notice he was more a Treq/AMC too? I'm not saying we play him out of position as a AMR, Roma had him there cuz of Totti and it's perfect for him to drift inside and it means we can keep Eriksen/Holtby more central (we don't need more AMC's, unless it's Firmino) but he excels big time when he gets that space in the middle of the field. Whenever he seems to ''do damage'' it's from the centre of the pitch. If it's a pass, dribble or shot it's always central. 

&gt;I actually dont really agree on Lennon being particularly direct! He has a reputation for that but he doesnt really do that anymore.

Yeah, actually I have to agree with you there for sure. Now he seems afraid now to take players on. It's weird, considering times he's gone on insane runs - v Arsenal comes to mind when he just tore them apart and made Clichy (iirc?) look ridiculous and i'm sure he's ankle broken Evra once or twice.

My introduction to yodel was having to complain over a 10 day period that the next-day delivery I had paid for wasn't happening, even though the driver logged fake failed delivery attempts. They left no evidence of attempted deliveries, and as I was working by a window looking directly at my drive and front door the whole time, I knew they were forging records. Yodel promised several times they would get someone to deliver, but just kept filing fake reports. The driver turned up eventually with a box that was significantly damaged. As the order was for a number of high-capacity hard drives, I refused the delivery - they would have been trashed. 

Three days later, he turned up and tried to get me to sign for them again, acting as though we had never met. 

So 10 days for a next-day, wrecked delivery. I n the meantime, I ordered from a different supplier and made sure they used Royal Mail. It turned up next day intact. 

I'm sure there are good and bad people there. In my experience, the drivers were terrible and didn't care about either contractual obligations or their deliveries, and the drivers and managers I spoke to were clear and demonstrable liars. 

If yodel were forced out of business, I'm sure competent companies would expand and take your driver on. In the meantime - I keep as far away as possible from yodel or companies that use yodel.

But this game he really shined in patches, and it makes me shake my head when people say he totally flopped when he looked another level to nearly everyone that day. And that's him early on when he probably couldn't even say ''Hi'' in England and looked like a deer in the headlights in interviews ;) 

It also showed how he connected with Holtby, another player I expect to come good in AMC. I was gonna do a thread on him, and similar to how Utd ruined Kagawa I feel Holtby is ruined at MC and is a MENTAL AMC, especially in Poch's high pressure system like Kagawa at Dortmund. Holtby can't press from MC, gets too tired and doesn't have the positioning to play there or influence the game. Schalke 10/Germany u21 captain Holtby to MC Holtby on loan at Fulham is totally wrong. He's another player I feel everyone (other fans mostly) underrate but he's creative as fuck, energetic and will press the CB's and put his body on the line.

The decision makers are the people who overturn decisions made by the job centre, not the other way around.

Do you have written evidence that the decision maker found in your favour? Contact the Citizens Advice Bureau and show them this, alongside the record of the jobs you have applied for, maybe they have come across similar issues before. Also it might be a good idea to contact your MP in regards to this. Depending on how good they are, they might get somebody to look into it, or at least give you a contact to turn to, which could accelerate the process of having the decision overturned back in your favour.

But first and foremost, go to the job centre and argue your case, but be calm and reasonable (Do not raise your voice, swear etc. or they will just sanction you on those grounds instead).

He looked completely out of sorts and was a cup player. If I'm looking for a CB, I want a guy who commands the pairing, and earns the minutes. Nastasic had chances with Demichelis being terrible for the first half of the season and was never able to seize the opportunity. 

It is clear MN has a longer record, but it's not clear that he is at this point a better choice than Rekik. Versatility, clear fit into the system, younger, more affordable and not coming off a long injury. Rekik doesn't need to registered as well. If Juve comes in on a loan-to-buy deal for Nastasic worth 15-20 million, I pull the trigger without hesitation. 

City are trying to win quadruples, and I think that a three of VK, MD, EM is fine, plus a fourth of Rekik is suitable for cup matches. We can't afford ""wait-and-see"" approaches.

He can't be anything else, and I believe we should play 3 AMC's almost (Lamela drifts inside he basically is a AMC) or even have Eriksen on the left out of possession as Holtby works his ass off, just so Lewis is our Number 10. I want Firmino though, but those 3 I think will work perfectly. 

I was gonna do a whole thread on this - why he reminds me of Kagawa at Dortmund (with their pressing, how they play) and how anywhere in MC he's wasted, and how he would excel like crazy as a AMC. He's not a MC, he's not a DMC playmaker, he's a straight energetic high wokerate agile creative as fuck AMC. Like Kagawa was. You don't get the number 10 at Schalke and German u21 captain for being a MC who presses himself into the ground for 60 minutes - at AMC he can focus purely on his area of the pitch.  

Sandro is good, but he doesn't tend to fall back into defence like Poch's system requires when the CB's split. Also, he's still a bit 50/50 with his knee and you can tell he's subconsciously still a bit unnerved by it and how strong it is. Sadly. 

I would feel safer with Capoue/Schneiderlin. Especially as Morgan is EPL tested. Dembele/Paulinho...I'm not sure of their roles. I mean, they're box to box players sure, but I don't know how well they would fit in the system. I prefer Bentaleb there, to be honest, looking at how Poch set us up vs Celtic.

No, it's not insane.  It is what Monaco was willing to pay in order to get him to join their team.  It isn't his ""demand"" for payment and there is absolutely zero sign that he's sitting there demanding that he get paid 375k/week from another club.  You're making assumptions and then calling him greedy.

true,tedwatkins,null,null,"I'd assumed you were referencing the season 88/89 still. The previous years failing at the final hurdle was a big factor, as was Souness, along with Kenny leaving. Back on topic though.

As the biography you reference states, forced errors are the key to winning games without possession. Though more importantly, it's the position of these forced errors. High pressing leads to this and it's something Liverpool have done effectively last season on plenty of occasions. Rodgers knows how to play the same system when it's required.

However it's not the only way to play and just because your looking back in hindsight saying we should have done it this way, doesn't make it correct. 

On the flip side of the coin: 66% of games won in the champions league last season were done so by the team with possession. This statistic actually exists over a much longer period also.

So back to the error that cost us the game, as it's obvious we should discount the second goal as we were chasing the game right at the death. Is that a forced error? Is that Jose's master stroke that he was planning for? Did Demba Ba give Stevie the fear and force him to lose his footing? Bollocks. It's a once in a blue moon mistake that was unforced and we could play the game another 10 times and we'd either draw or win it.

What's Jose's blueprint for playing at home out of interest?

He's obviously really important to them, but they did finish mid table and he wasn't picked for the National Team (Scolari is fucking thick) so...

By A Level you're so specified down that you would struggle to be allowed in to a hard science-related course at uni, because you'd only have a breadth of three subjects to demonstrate your general knowledge, they'd question why you hadn't taken Maths in this case probably. Whereas with the Scottish system, you'd probably have five+ Highers and possibly also Advanced Highers to demonstrate your breadth of knowledge; they might be more likely to take a punt on you being able to handle it.

The English/Northern Irish system of A Levels has you aiming with specific A Levels at a specific career from age 14/15 so they expect you to be specified down by that point: while the Scottish system encourages you to study a breadth of subjects.

[Here's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BucAZfzIQAA51Hk.png) a picture of Tony Barrett's article using the word ""demand."" Shall I go on, or do you think salaries are just a one-sided affair and Falcao just takes whatever is offered? 

Even mentioning what he wants *after tax* is worthless with regard to Monaco, as there is no tax. Adding that caveat ""after tax"" shows it is what his representatives have been asking for, as that qualifier is only necessry in a country where they charge tax--meaning if he leaves Monaco. It isn't like they're just saying that's what he's currently on and wants to keep.

And the second quote you posted was in reference to this from you:
&gt;I think you've got this backward. Monaco are the ""greedy"" ones and they only convinced a player like Falcao to go there because they were willing to pay him insane wages.

How on Earth you think Monaco is greedy for paying a player fair wages is beyond me. Let me be clear--Falcao deserves £200k per week from his club, but he doesn't deserve £370k per week. Greedy would be asking for your wages to nearly double so that you can make the same money you made at the only club in the world that could offer that exact amount of money.

Plus regardless of ''skewed stats'' and the way Hoffenheim play, he's a fucking insane talent at 22 picking up those numbers for a team that finished 9th and is ''all action''. That's why I consider him ''gettable'' - unless of course a bigger club comes in.

I don't know if it's because it is Chelsea, or you hold a grudge against Mourinho, but he's earned a little credit, even on an LFC sub. Just look at what he has won. I don't think he goes into games hitting and hoping. Ba took opportunity of an error, or slip. If we had scored four goals already it wouldn't have mattered, but because Chelsea came and parked the bus so successfully, it did matter. 

They played to take opportunity of Liverpool's swashbuckling approach last season and we came out without any subterfuge or guile in our play and fell clean into it. I think Rodgers got carried away that we'd overpower them eventually (we nearly did, we were playing fine attacking play all year), he wasn't expecting such a well-drilled, uninterested opponent. This season I expect other teams to take a similar approach of sitting back and denying space against us.

He wasn't particularly good at Maths, I think he got either a C or D overall at A Level, but he was genuinely one of the most incredible programmers I've ever seen. An absolute genius programming. I think that's why Newcastle fitted him, because the course their goes quite lightly on the Maths side. For me, I'm at the University of Bath doing Comp. Sci and the course is really quite grounded in Maths. You'd undoubtedly find it tricky if you only got a C or a D at A level in Maths - I was definitely struggling at points last year and I had a better results in Maths A Level than my friend at Newcastle.

Ultimately it really depends on the course, which can relate back to the topic at hand here. The school A-level advice can be better, but I really think it's up to the students themselves to research themselves what the course requirements are for what they may want to do. Spending 10-15 minutes on various university websites will give you a really good idea of what you need, so I'm not entirely sure the blame should be picked up by schools in this situation.
