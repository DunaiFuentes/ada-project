UKIP has mixed the two issues up by using it's anti-EU policies to also sometimes be anti-immigrant and casually racist. The two would not and a should not mean the same thing. Tony Benn was anti-EU I believe and for entirely non-immigration related reasons. 

Also I should point out that EU immigration has (I believe off the top of my head) at no point been higher than 1/3 of all immigration and up until about 2004 was very low indeed (~5% max). The vast majority of immigration to the UK is from outside the EU.

No, you need to split it up depending on goals, etc. When thinking about how much to put into your pension, I'd advise you to look into what you think you'll need at retirement and work out what you'll need to contribute to get there.

What I was saying was don't just pick a number and say ""Oh I'll put X into it"", you need to work out a number that makes sense. Start too low and you'll find yourself trying to catch up later. 

For the rest of it, there aren't many options but I'd hardly describe them as stupid. 5 year timeframe you want to be putting things into guaranteed savings (not investments) so look out for the highest interest rate you can get. Beyond that, it's all about trying to pay as little tax as possible as both income and capital gains.

true,veritanuda,null,null,"&gt; Can't geo-thermal, tidal, bio-mass and biogas be base load as they are predictable?

Predictability is not the same as constant power production.

Geo-thermal is the only one that could be called reliable. Alas though given [the geology of the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_the_United_Kingdom) such 'hot spots' are few and far between. Does not mean is cannot be used as part of a whole solution though.

Bio-mass is not as eco friendly as you may think. As you are essentially taking existing carbon locked up in living organisms the only way to release that energy is by releasing the carbon [as CO2 CO or Hydrocarbons.](http://renewables.morris.umn.edu/biomass/faq/) If we were creating biomass at the same rate we would be using it then we could reach equilibrium in terms of carbon output/input. Sadly that is never going to happen if we continue to cut down forests for palm oil plantations, burn coal, oil, gas and wood.

Tidal is at best an untested technology and there are many [pros and cons](http://www.renewablegreenenergypower.com/tidal-energy-tidal-power-pros-and-cons/) to it alas.

Don't get me wrong, we need to use re-newables we just cannot expect them to replace coal or gas fired power stations or nuclear. And what we must strive for is cutting our carbon footprint completely. In that regard the only truly carbon free high density energy solution is nuclear. Our mistake is in thinking there is only one way to do nuclear and that involves plutonium dangerous pressures and complex control systems. It is time to revisit the problem.

You say that Carroll was already proven in the league. I do not quite agree with that assessment. I don't mean to sound rude or anything but I think a lot of others would agree that it was hugely a risky buy. Also keep in mind that we would have never bid for Carroll if Torres didn't put in that transfer request! And that is why I say that this case is very much different from Carroll. Again, I'm not saying if/when we get Lallana, he will be super successful from game 1. But at least it will be something BR is trying out according to his plan and I want to believe in him.

I don't think they're hard to find, I think they're just super-rare and somewhat subtle. I've been serial-marathoning every Trek series for years (great background noise while working), and it took all this time to notice this one. 

Re: Riker's [Sonic Driver](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Sonic_driver), that's also an obvious nod. Like I said, I don't think it's ambiguous, I think it's just tasteful and subtle, something only Who fans would get. 

Trek doesn't really ""do"" extra-universe references-- in fact I can't at the moment think of any others other than the MC Hammer 'Hammertime' reference in DS9 S03E02 ""The Explorers"" where Ben and Jake go to set up the hammocks and they say:

Ben: Hammock Time!

Jake: Yo!

So in his case although he was making a profit on paper he wasn't actually putting anything in his pocket. He sold the house recently and it fetched what he'd paid for it because where we are in the UK, house prices have been stagnant for half a decade so no, profit isn't guaranteed.

Seeing a couple of stories and hearing a few things the last few days regarding Neil leaving has left me feeling that no matter who we get in as a new manager, they will still encounter the same problems that lead to Neil Lennon leaving. Now Neil took the job knowing full well that he would have to work within a limited budget and get the most out of what he had, which I thought he did quite well, considering the mess we were in.

However, we all know that players were brought in that the manager did not fancy, Balde, possibly Pukki and Gershon being one, that Matt McGlone tweeted recently was done as a favour for an agent (dunno how true that is but Remi didn't get too many games). Now I don't mind a manager working to a budget and knowing that he can only afford x,y or z for a player but when players are being brought in that you haven't seen and don't fancy then this makes it doubly difficult to operate. Add in the fact that we were only a couple of grand away from agreeing a deal for Hooper and that the manager also wanted Ledley and Samaras to stay then you can see why this would have made up his mind to leave.

Now Peter Lawell is quite a divisive character amongst the Celtic fans and wields a heck of a lot of influence within Scottish football but how much of an influence is he having on the playing side and our ambitions going forward? This whole buy low, sell high policy is all well and good and I know it is necessary to a certain degree but it is getting to the stage that we don't seem to building the club to grow with any sense of philosophy or design. The signing seem haphazard and borne more out of luck rather than a sense of purpose. Just check the amount of mediocre strikers we have had and are still accumulating and then we have players, some like Sammy, Ledley, Hooper and even Fisher are entering the final year of their contracts with nothing sorted then hurriedly being sold or let go.

I'd like to think we would be ambitious and get someone in like Moyes, Weighorst, MacKay, Clarke or Oscar Garcia but can see us get someone like Coyle or McNamara. Someone who is a cheap option and who will put up his lot, as he will be grateful to be in a big job (just as Neil probably was at the begining). Now, I am not expecting Celtic to go and spend millions beyond what we have and I would expect a new manager to bring on more youngsters but when your budget is spent on players you don't want, will the new guy not get as frustrated as Neil was? When the players you want to keep are sold and then we can't get adequate replacements, how will this affect the way we play and what we see on the park.

Now with Pete's roles within the SFA and in Europe, he looks as if he'll be here to stay for quite a while but should the new manager not be working more closely with John Park to get the types of men in that he wants rather than the players that Pete might want? If the new manager being brought in is a stronger character than Neil and wants to do things mainly his way will he last long?

There is more to the south east than London. There's also the type of job, someone working minimum wage and someone on 40k are both going to be ""in employment"", but it doesn't change the fact that buying a house is still a struggle for both. Unless you think it's better that people only work minimum wage jobs where they can buy houses for 50p, instead of being able to do a job they want to do and never own a house.

I live in a part of the country where it's not the South East, has a crappy local economy (most people are in dead end minimum wage jobs), and house prices are still stratospheric that no one can afford. The worst of both worlds. 

&gt; It has the lowest crime figures in the country. 

Does it now.

&gt; Which is the obsession with concentrating everything on London.

There are many solutions to the problem, but if companies won't move (as great as it would be to see some regional balance), we should at least work to make sure that people aren't screwed over because of where their employer chooses to locate themselves.

There it was, a dark swarm heading towards them rapidly where there had been calm sea only moments earlier. 

The captain gritted his teeth and activated the intercom: ""This is your captain speaking. We've all heard terrible things over the past few days and we all knew that there would be a moment when we saw those things for ourselves. Well, it appears that moments has come sooner than expected, this is a fine ship with the best crew a captain could ask for and now we have a job to do. Battle stations. 

The deck plating began to tremble as the ships powerful engines fired up, the captain looked at the flight deck proudly as he saw his crew performing their duty with haste and efficiency, the reports began flying in:

""Engines at full sir""

""All exterior access points locked down sir""

""All missile batteries loaded and ready sir""

He smiled to himself, if this was to be his last stand then they weren't going to take it lying down at least. His thoughts were interrupted by a young serviceman nervously giving a report 

""Sir... I don't know how... They're outrunning us even with engines at full"" 

""My god"" 

Even with the carriers missile batteries and cannons firing at full it wasn't long until the swarm began to engulf the ship. It was like nothing he had ever seen. Bullets, barricades, nothing even slowed them down. They might of well been firing tennis balls for all the good it was doing reports began flying in from the below decks claiming that the swarm was making it's way through the ship

""No..."" 

The captain checked personal firearm before dashing below decks, the swarm was ignoring most of the vessel just making a beeline for the VIP guest quarters. He would not allow his last mission to be a failure or at least, if it were to be a failure he would fight until his last bullet and his last breath. 

He rounded the last corner, his gun ready but what he saw before him was not what he expected. A bunch of... People... Drenched from head to toe but still standing, his presence and gun didn't even seem to phase them as they opened the door to reveal it's occupant.

Steven Moffat turned as the door swung open, a rabid fan closest to the opening charged in and pinned him against the wall, speaking far to close to Moffat's face for comfort he said ""I have six words to say to you, just six"" he leaned in close to Moffat's ear and spoke

People who have not experienced being the victim of abuse never really understand. It does not matter how you behave, the aggressor will find any excuse to escalate an argument with you. They are addicted to inflicting pain on the victim - not just physical, mentally and emotionally too. Most of the time, the victim probably believes they love the abuser deeply and does not want to cause them harm.

How does one get into this situation? Surely if you are dating somebody and they hit you, you just leave, right? Not so easy. It's a very gradual process. At first the abuser appears to be a fantastic person. You trust them and tell them everything about yourself, including some deeply personal things. They remember all this information, especially things that you might not want others knowing (perhaps relating to friends and family). Next stage is gradual build up of arguments, and each argument is followed by intense ""love bombing"". Slowly, physical elements are bought into it, but by then you are conditioned to know that when the argument is over, the person you love will come back and be super lovely again. So you just grit your teeth and get through it. Fast forward 12 months and being smacked in the face is just a normal part of the week, and you live with it because 1) you love the person 90% of the time, and 2) you are trapped with a list of threats of what will happen if you try to leave.

Why do people abuse in this way? Actually I feel quite sorry for them. Perhaps they were hurt deeply in their past or childhood, or had love taken away from them unexpected. The abuse is a method of controlling the person they love. They don't want to lose that love/person. I don't think they are evil human beings, just ones that need to re-learn how to behave within relationships - unfortunately the victim will never be able to offer that reeducation. Deep down they hate themselves for their behaviour but just don't know how to get out of the cycle.

I don't see why we'd make our money back on Alberto. no one has seen him play properly since Barca B. Lose a couple million is more like it, which is obviously not good. there, that's a negative from Alberto.

Yes Borini is worth more, but we haven't had any bids for him, that we know of anyway. you say he's scored big goals and has more experience, which is true - he had a successful loan spell. but we can't assume he will score ""big goals"" when he comes back, because he didn't when we had him.

So whilst you name Borini's good loan spell as a good thing, it's pretty clear more bad came from those deals than good: we're losing money on Alberto, and we have Borini, a striker we hope will work. last season we had the same thing, plus the money.

I think having to loan Borini in the first place was a let down, considering his fee. 

I hope that the players we sign this window for 10mil+ don't have to go on loan before they become useful for the first team, because that would really damage our team. that would be bad.

You think a couple of millions loss is a negative? It's a write-off. It's nothing. Liverpool's revenue eats it, shits it out and then forgets it about it.

And now you admit Borini's loan spell was great, but we can't guarantee he'll repeat it?

I am looking at the transfers objectively. I don't care about being bias towards my club.

MY POINT IS: these transfers have not 'not worked out'. Alberto probably played a little less than he should have, and maybe Borini was not meant to go out on loan. But they are young squad players. This is exactly what we do. We cannot have 11 world-class players and no-one on the bench. Borini is a great squad player - we didn't need him last season, but we will this.

Borini's fee was £10m also. You think that a £10m player going out on loan is a let-down? What aspirations do you have for this club that you think that's the case? Cos any team that wins the league or plays in the Champions League does not see that is a let down.

Tell you what, I can't be bothered trying to justify my perfectly reasonable opinion anymore.

If you trust Brendan Rodgers, go and see what he says about Borini. See if he thinks he's a failure.

Maybe I'll just try and learn from the mistakes of other fans who wrote off Sterling last season, Allen last season, Henderson last season, Sakho this season, Flanagan last season, Lucas when he arrived, Kuyt when he arrived, etc, etc, etc, and not try and sum up a transfer of a bright, young, clearly talented squad player after TWO SEASONS. ONE OF WHICH HE WAS A BACKUP, AND ONE WHERE HE WASN'T AT THE CLUB BUT PERFORMED INCREDIBLY WELL AT THE CLUB HE WAS LOANED AT IN THE EXACT SAME DIVISION WE PLAYED IN.

Go and ask the Sunderland fans how many of them would buy Borini for £15m if the club had the money.

EDIT: Please answer this question directly: what is it about being a Liverpool fan that makes you concerned about £2m? At what point did you stop looking at results and performances and start looking at the balance sheet? This isn't football manager. The budget is not rigid, Rodger's doesn't have a slider he has to adjust. Losing two million on Alberto won't mean that FSG won't go from 20m to 22m for another player.

true,discopowerpack,lfc99,,"Yeah I agree that you can't really compare two players that play different positions and who were bought in different contexts. But I don't see a difference between Carroll and Lallana in terms of how fans are reacting to their signing rumours.

Firstly I take back what I said, and agree with you that Carroll wasn't truly promising. In saying that, neither is Lallana. 

Carroll scored 11 goals in 20 apps with Newcastle in the EPL before we signed him, and 19 goals in around 40 in the Championship the season before that. His transfer rumours were controversial because whilst he was in good form, he wasn't fully proven in the EPL. People were saying one good season isn't enough, not to mention the panic buy stuff.

Back to Lallana, how is he any different from Carroll? Two seasons in the EPL, only his last season was noteworthy - 9 goals from 38, quite good for a midfielder. Before these two seasons, he played well in the Championship. With his rumours comes controversy. ""One good EPL season doesn't warrant 25mil"" etc.

Yes Carroll and Lallana are different players. Yes I rate Lallana's versatility and think he had a good season. I don't think he's proven in the EPL though, just as Carroll wasn't.

I think the real discussion is is he worth 25mil?",0,1400932223,null,0,false,0,chpy831,t3_26anrm,t1_chpy831,t1_chpwy1r,null,1435492469,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Termehh,rangers,,"I think that it's certainly more competitive in the cup competitions but Celtic will just steam roll the league every year. The interest outside Scotland is dwindling as well. Old Firm days used to attract a lot of attention. Now we're just another small time league making up numbers in Europe. We're no different from the Scandinavian leagues now. The old firm may be big clubs with a big following, but in terms of actually competing for things non domestically, we're still small fries. Especially Rangers now. 

Scottish football is on its knees at the moment. It's not due to Rangers going down, it's due to mismanagement of the game and a failure to acknowledge the evolution in the times and to adapt accordingly. Football used to be one of the only forms of entertainment aimed at men, now there's so many things competing with it, the heads of Scottish football are failing to realise it and it's costing us dearly.

Non-OF fans might enjoy it in the meantime as they have cup runs they haven't seen in many years but if it keeps going the way its going, we will end up in a league where some of our premier league teams are part time. The money well has dried up, the interest is drying up and soon, no players of any stature will want to come to Scotland. That's already happening.

As I said previously, whens the last time we saw a true great player play in Scotland. The last world class player was Larsson and he left Celtic in 2004. So in 10 years, we've went from players like him to the state its in now.

You don't have to be rich to buy shares. The rich pay higher income tax.

The Blair/Brown governments attempted to build up a client state and overborrowed and overextended the UK at the same time. Cameron has been shaming celebrities into paying tax instead of using legal avoidance measures.

that's pretty ignorant, considering Liverpool's transfer blunders and bankruptcy scares at the end of Benitez/start of Hodgson. i guess i'll answer your question directly here: i'm concerned about Liverpool's balance sheet because millions of dollars being lost on investments is how businesses go bankrupt. I don't want Liverpool to go bankrupt. that's why I'm interested. but it's beside the point that you don't value my interests (""it's just nonsense"").

&gt;Alberto probably played a little less than he should have, and maybe Borini was not meant to go out on loan. But...

you're providing evidence against your own opinion.

I agree that there are positives with Borini. I don't agree with you that those were good transfers. Looking at all the evidence we have atm, i don't see how you can be happy with them. I'm not upset, but I'm not satisfied. are you satisfied with Borini/Alberto types of transfers? The only way this Borini transfer will be worthwhile is if we sell him at a profit or he starts playing well. neither of these things have happened, so it's not reasonable to say that they were good transfers.

how much profit do you think we'll make on Borini? a couple million? is that positive? oh wait, ""It's a write-off. It's nothing. Liverpool's revenue eats it, shits it out and then forgets it about it."" how much money is good money to you?

I don't need you to list a bunch of great players because that's obviously confirmation bias, and an argument you were having with someone else. For every Kuyt and Sturridge there's an Alberto or Konchesky or Aspas or Spearing.

Here's the evidence for Borini:

PROS: 
Cost £10m, which is cheap, regardless of what you say, in modern football. It's the price of a squad player. 

Premier League experience.

He *has* been playing well. You insist that he hasn't but you must not have seen any Sunderland matches. He is a legend there.

He scores important goals. This is invaluable. He has the nerve to handle the pressure of an important match.

EDIT: *How could I forget: and this is the reason you mentioning Hicks/Gillett is ridiculous*. HE HAS LOW WAGES. It's a low-risk transfer. He isn't a burden on the wage bill, and neither is Alberto. This is key. Hicks/Gillett's problems were partly to do with exorbitant wage fees. Rodgers has cut all of these away.

CONS:

He didn't immediately score as many goals as the other (world-class) strikers for the club from the bench.

We might not make a profit.

_____________


It is **incredibly** unreasonably to say Borini is a bad transfer.

I don't think we'll make any profit on Borini, but yes a couple of million would be a write-off. *But we would get the money back that we spent* (I'll use italics instead of all caps so as not to be a ""bellend"" - thanks for the name calling).

I wouldn't like to continue to discuss transfers with you. You'd just repeat the same tired crap ad-infinitum and then call me names when I didn't concede.

Also, football just inst popular with as many kids now a days. They'd much rather be playing Call of Duty. I sound like an old man here. I'm only 22.

-

Quite high actually, He had some troubles making the transition from Youth football to professional football, because he could easily dominate other Youth players which is physical strength, something he couldn't do against grown men. 

But he adopted during his year at Leverkusen and doesn't have those problems anymore. 

He is still what I would call very raw. His Technique is amazing for a Centerl midfielder, he is good at dribbling and his passing is superb, his passes don't jump but clide above the pitch and the strength of it are usually right, too.

But he lacks ""intelligence"" on the pitch, which means he decides to make the wrong decision on the pitch. He plays the risky pass when he should play it save, which often still leads to a dangerous loss of possession, or he goes into a dribbling which leaves his team mates out of position when he loses the ball. A lot of people seem to only remember those moments and don't rate him because of that. 

But all of that are things he can improve with more experience, and if he can improve with that he will become a big player in the future.

She made sure to check with the council early, before the deadline of 6th May, to ensure that everything was in order to allow her to vote. Pre-registration for local elections is apparently not even mandatory, so long as you bring the poll card. So she deliberately checked earlier and with more effort than should have been necessary, just so that something like this wouldn't happen. I went through the whole thing myself, just to add an extra pair of eyes (I am British, so did not need to do any of this myself).

It is the electoral officer's ***job*** to advise people of these things when they call up asking about registering to vote. They didn't tell her by phone or mail, so on the poll day, she was unable to do anything since, at that point, it was allegedly too late.

No, he did not.

Yes if SAF was still in charge and yes if utd finished 7th this would be just a blip on the radar and  they would have the pull to attract top names.  But now they're on their 3rd manager in 12 months and LVG is a strict disciplinarian which will put some players off. Secondly the turmoil. Anderson talking shit as he went on his loan, RVP saying that other players are out of position and making it difficult for him to perform. Rio critiquing moyes' naming of the squad too late on a match day and don't forget giggs apparently having a go at moyes for his tactics.   Oh yeah an vidic the captain signing for inter and leaving the hot mess that is utd as soon as he possibly could. That's just some of what was reported and probably a fraction of what actually happened. Don't forget players talk, so who knows what's been said behind closed doors.

Yes moyes is gone and Van Gaal certainly has a better reputation and will attract players that moyes wouldn't of been able to. The facts are these: he's yet to manage a game for utd, this is a club under major transition and cannot offer champions league or Europa, as well as LVG being a hard ass which might rub players the wrong way. Lets put it this way, If a world class player is being linked to Chelsea, arsenal, LIVERPOOL dortmund and ateltico,  why would that player choose utd when those other clubs can offer European football?

I'm Danish and have lived in the UK. I recently moved back to Copenhagen precisely because of the crazy real estate market in the London area, where the only option is to rent an overpriced house full of mouldy carpets, at a price that doesn't make it worth my while, even working as a software developer.

I bought a two-room flat in one of the centrally located boroughs of Copenhagen for the equivalent of about £140,000. I financed the whole thing with loans, landing me at a monthly expense of about £900 after tax. Now, the housing market in Copenhagen has been going up since forever, but there are some very strict limitations in place that serve to keep prices more or less under control. One of them is rent regulation — you can't buy a place and then rent it out at whatever price you want. Another is a very strict set of regulations on the loan market, although the rules were relaxed quite a bit before the bubble in 2008.

Another factor is the prevalence of equity-sharing housing co-ops. Most Copenhagen boroughs were built in very tight space during industrialization, meaning flats rather than houses and tight urban communities tailored for a low-income population that hasn't historically been able to afford real estate. To this day, there are strict limits on the prices of equity-shared flats, set by each individual ownership association, which keeps the overall real estate market in check. I wouldn't be able to sell my flat at an outrageous price when &gt;60% of competing flats on the market have a fixed upper limit.

In general, there is a tendency to think of home ownership as a long-term investment, but not a ""right"" per se. Low-income families will usually rent, but the housing market even in some of the most attractive spots in the city is by and large approachable for middle-income individuals and families. With some exceptions, obviously, but nowhere near as crazy as London.",0,1400938304,null,0,false,0,chpzgu7,t3_26d0p9,t1_chpzgu7,t1_chpxlc0,null,1433935127,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

At the moment the market is far to overpriced, and yes ok , price is based on demand, but currently the demand is artificially stimulated by government policy and super low interest rates. That won't last for long. 

So I am ok with renting for now (but it can't be permanent). 

I want see what happens over the next few years, as I have concerns the housing market could take the entire economy down in a nose dive. If things get to bad, I can give a months notice and easily find work in Germany, living somewhere nice like Munich or Dusseldorf etc. If it manages to correct in a sensible staged manner, then I might buy.

But as it stands, no way am I am paying between 200-250k for a little 3 bed terrace (with one room being the size of some peoples wardrobes). 

And before anyone reminds me of prices up north being cheaper, I know. But I don't want to live there. Nothing personal, but I am from the south and my line of work is mainly concentrated to the M4 corridor.

We are now in the same position as Japan. We have a 'recovery' based on overpriced assets and the structural issues which came to head in 2008 have not been resolved, they merely inflated the property market again. 

To be honest, I can't see any politicians fixing this and they are not the right people with incentives to make it happen. On average politicians own 2-3 houses, with one being super prime in London and paid for by us. Why would they want to see their asset prices sensibly eroded over time? They don't, no matter how socially minded they might like to come over as, they don't want that to happen.

This is why the Ofcom rules are in place. If there were no such rules you would see a US Fox News type scenario where a broadcaster gives almost 100% of coverage to their preferred party.

As it stands in the UK, all parties are entitled to a party political broadcast which is a good thing, but it's the coverage in the mainstream news that is the issue. Now we're seeing Nigel Farage in the same studio discussion as David Cameron and Ed Milliband, which gives him an opportunity to promote his party and debate key issues. This has allowed them to gain electoral support, whilst other small parties are not afforded this opportunity. Ofcom were always reluctant to implement this, but now they have opened Pandora's box. They can't just pick and choose which small parties to be give major party status, it gives them way too much control over the turnout of elections.

There's usually a long line of people spilling out into the street, but that's actually the queue for people who haven't yet purchased their tickets. If you're collecting rather than buying, you should go to the Collection Point at the far end of the Box Office and use the machines that let you print your own tickets.

They do not have a chance to push their other policies because they don't have the right to equal TV coverage, which means they're simply left out of the debate.

Lucas is all about reading the play, nicking the ball, then passing it into feet or out wide quickly accurately and reliably. He almost never looks for the high-risk/reward pass, but rarely loses the ball (without being too conservative).

Can is physical, quick, erratic, likes to to take a lot of touches and dribble and looks for more adventurous passes.

Unless we change our system again, our DM is as.much an advanced centre back than a central midfielder. Lucas does this really well, I don't see Can fitting in there. He looks like he would fit in well as one of the two midfielders in front of the DM, positions that require high energy, physicality and some amount of creativity.

I'd be happy with this because we need depth in those positions because of the physical demands. Only Henderson pulled it off consistently, Allen was good but had injury problems.

&gt; (1) Any person who with intent to deceive impersonates a member of a police force or special constable, or makes any statement or does any act calculated falsely to suggest that he is such a member or constable, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.

&gt; (2) Any person who, not being a constable, wears any article of police uniform in circumstances where it gives him an appearance so nearly resembling that of a member of a police force as to be calculated to deceive shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.

&gt; (3)Any person who, not being a member of a police force or special constable, has in his possession any article of police uniform shall, unless he proves that he obtained possession of that article lawfully and has possession of it for a lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 1 on the standard scale.

&gt; (4)In this section—

&gt;  (a)“article of police uniform” means any article of uniform or any distinctive badge or mark or document of identification usually issued to members of police forces or special constables, or anything having the appearance of such an article, badge, mark or document, 

&gt; [F1(aa)“member of a police force” includes a member of the British Transport Police Force,] and

&gt; (b)“special constable” means a special constable appointed for a police area.


http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/90

The CPS policy

&gt; Impersonating a Police Officer Section 90 Police Act 1996 creates several offences relating to the impersonation of police officers or the possession of articles of police uniform, namely:

&gt; * impersonating a police officer (including a special constable);
&gt; * making a statement or doing any act calculated falsely to suggest membership of a police force;
&gt; * wearing a police uniform calculated to deceive;
&gt; * possessing an article of police uniform.


&gt; The circumstances of the case may disclose more than one of these offences. It will seldom be necessary to charge more than one offence. You should select the most appropriate.

&gt; You should consider the motive of the defendant. Where the impersonation involves a threat to the safety of any person, or to property, or is done with a view to financial gain, then a prosecution should follow.

Granted I am not a lawyer, but what he was doing does not seem to 'falsely to suggest membership of a police force' nor does it appear to be 'calculated to deceive'. So you would have to assume that the guy was in possession of an article of police uniform, though the hat and the jacket looked not too genuine, and the mask probably isn't standard police issue either.

I know for sure that A* on average is 75% total, or 180 marks.

I *think* that B is 55-60% but I am not sure. Assuming it is 60% you need 144 marks in total. You already have 60, so you only need to get 84 marks across the exams. That means 28 out of 60 on each of the exams and you *should* get a B.

Secondly, depending on the difficulty of the test the grade boundries will be higher or lower, for example, if it was a very hard test in OCR's opinion the boundries will be set lower, for example A* being 38 instead of 45.

If you wish to judge whether the BBC is giving a party relatively good or relatively poor coverage, it needs to be compared relative to the coverage they give other parties. It would be like saying a company is biased against black people because they reject 90% of black applicants, and then say it's ""whataboutism"" if someone points out that they also reject 90% of white applicants. 

&gt; Regarding UKIPs coverage on QT, Nigel Farage who isn't an MP has been on it more times than any MP

It is party coverage that matters, not individual coverage. The other parties prefer to split their spots between different people, whereas UKIP like to give most of the spots to their leader and their deputy leader. If Cameron wanted to take every Conservative spot, he would be allowed and would be on a lot more than Farage.

&gt; UKIP generally have been grossly over-represented considering their complete lack of elected representatives domestically.

The coverage of a party should be related to how much support they have, not how many seats our unfair and distorted electoral system gives them.

&gt; Nick Robinson was criticising Farage for being a hypocrite as he hired his migrant wife to work as a secretary whilst criticising EU migrants for taking British job. In the same respect, Diane Abbott was criticised for sending her son to private school.

It's certainly reasonable criticism. The question is whether you base the entire launch of an election campaign on just one criticism, without covering their policies. As for Diane Abbott, she is an interesting example. How often do you think a UKIP politician would be invited on as a BBC expert had they said ""black people love playing divide and rule?""",0,1400943026,null,0,false,0,chq0rpc,t3_26b18y,t1_chq0rpc,t1_chpzn9o,null,1433935736,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The TLDR of the article is that gender segregation in the juvenile prison system is under threat and there are plans to move mother and baby units, which already exist in women's prisons and in Juvenile detention centres for girls, in to larger mix-gender prisons or centres. 

Where it's safe to do so there are a lot of benefits to keeping babies and mothers together in early years, if a mother misses the first months or years of her child's life it can be very hard to establish a good maternal connection once they're reunited and that can have lifelong implications. 

Prison reformers campaigned very hard to allow mothers to keep their babies and pre-school children with them when serving sentences for moderate, non-violent offences, the problem with the proposal is NOT kids being with their mothers when their mothers are detained, the problem is having them in unsuitable accommodation.

'smaller landowning is likely...' really? what evidence do you have of this? it seems nonintuitive that if you have bogs and heathland that you grow your veg there.
grouse moor is a habitat for said species and other highland wildlife, not an aristocratic plaything.

your arguments smell of liberal and anti-establishement bias and are lacking in merit.


btw the [same](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/10409499/Scottish-landowner-plans-to-bring-back-wolves-and-bears.html) paper tells this story of a wealthy landowner planning to reintroduce species there (this would never be possible if one divided the land up and sold it away for nothing). This could cause more tourists to visit the highlands if wildlife was more diversified and concentrated. best use of wilderness to me is to give it to wild things.

No loaning out endlessly, no bullshit.

We have player with just as much potential as Varane had at his age already at the club. But what are we doing instead of putting faith into them and getting them into our first team? Either putting them on our bench to be hardly used *or* just loaning them out.

If we actually buy Varane it will only enforce the stereotype that Chelsea only buys ready-made talent instead of developing their own, and at this instance I could not agree more.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Of course they do. Loads of wealthy people hide money off shore. Transparency International UK frequently highlight government and a wide variety of industries, which are supposed to have anti-fraud and anti-corruption bodies, for being so bloody fraudulent and corrupt!

[Who really owns Britain?](http://www.transparency.org.uk/news-room/blog/12-blog/909-who-really-owns-britain)
&gt;You will probably find unknown shell companies based in off-shore jurisdictions like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands. The problem is that the Land Registry itself does not know who is behind these shell companies, or in the jargon, who is the ‘beneficial owner’ of the property.

[Billionaire Britain](http://www.transparency.org.uk/news-room/blog/12-blog/911-billionaire-britain)
&gt;Illicit flows and proceeds of corruption should be denied safe haven in the UK. Banks are required to know their customers, and their sources of wealth.  How well they do this is a concern for the regulator. But to launder dirty money and buy luxury assets in the UK often involves accountants, solicitors, estate agents and other types of high-value dealers, all regulated for anti- money laundering.

&gt;However, TI-UK believes that these sectors are not ‘protecting the gates’ of the UK as well as they should be. Throw into the mix nominee directors, offshore companies (for which the ultimate beneficiaries may be secret), and complex trust arrangements, and it isn’t difficult to understand why banks and other gatekeepers simply cannot always know their customers well enough, or the origins of their billions.

&gt;Robert Barrington, the executive director of the UK chapter of Transparency International, says those primarily concerned with minimising tax may well forfeit anonymity. But those wanting to hide corrupt money will continue to use any method to do so, even if it costs them more in tax.

Buses and trains are cute, but the reality is they only work for some and certainly in the case of buses they tend to be transport methods for the poor or those in convenient circumstances. Buses and trains aren't ever going to move 45 million working Britons a day. Cars are, and it isn't the fault if those purchasing them.

now live in the US, you don't want to know how cheap houses are here in the US, it would make the average UK person green and puke.

foreclosed and slightly tatty houses go for around $60K here in rural Minnesota. average factory wage is maybe $14 ph locally.

He played in the MLS, and has performed astronomically well on the international stage. He gave the casual fan a stereotypical american player to root for, and he was unceremoniously cut. For a casual fan that's like the Yankees cutting Jeter... or for Spurs if we were to cut Dawson. Due to that I think that he has put himself in a position where he needs to perform, because the World Cup tournament is about winning now, you have 4 years after to get ready for the future. So when we bring a team that doesn't include the best 23 players the United States has to offer, i can't help but be skeptical, and i'm not the only one. That is why i bring the media into play, ESPN has single-handedly changed the course of sports history many times just due to their coverage... and this is getting Tim Tebow like hype right now. So while i would love to think that Klinsman knows what he's doing, and as much as i want to have faith and Dempsey, Howard, and Bradley.....

The point is that I don't want that culture over here.  I don't want Islam spreading to the EU.  I think that Islam is one of the worst religions.  I was using Egypt and Afghanistan as examples of Islamic countries and examples of why we don't want Islam in the UK.

&gt; In other words, let's avoid the question.

Not at all - there are obviously extremes.  There's a difference between physically defacing or urinating on something, and saying/writing/drawing something that someone finds offensive.

&gt; I'm not in favour of that, but I'm not in favour of people being arrested simply for causing offence to any particular group.

Great to hear.

But I'd still want someone stopped if they were publicly urinating on things (your example).  Do you disagree?

&gt; And the point is that there's plenty of overly sensitive people apart from some Muslims in this country, yet it's only the Muslim ones that ever get any form of focus for it.

Again you are trying to equate simply being ""sensitive"" to the outright killing of people for drawing a prophet, in order to try to ignore the problem.  This is dishonest.

And again you've completely refused to talk about apostasy.  You are a perfect example of ""not interested in facts or reasoned debate"".",0,1400949218,null,0,false,0,chq2t6f,t3_26b18y,t1_chq2t6f,t1_chq2dwv,null,1433936697,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I personally think he's done a good job, schools in the borough [have gone from the UK's worst to among the best in the world](http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2013/dec/11/tower-hamlets-transforming-failing-schools-ofsted), he's brought in policies like free school meals for all pupils before the Lib Dems introduced this nationwide, a £1,500 grant to those attending university, [he's built more council houses than any other council](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tower-hamlets-tops-new-homes-bonus-league-table/7001409.article), kept all libraries, children centres and youth/leisure centres open, improved rights for tenants, introduced a living wage for workers in the borough and banned involvement with companies which blacklist unionised workers. 

It's a myth that he's only supported by the Bengali community, true they do a lot of the rallying and canvassing but he does enjoy broad support among TH residents. Labour have suffered because they tried to constantly distance themselves from the Bengali (and Asian) community for fear they would alienate the white working class.

&gt;There's a difference between physically defacing or urinating on something, and saying/writing/drawing something that someone finds offensive.

Not massively - especially if it's your own property, as with the bloke done for videoing burning his own poppy.

&gt;But I'd still want someone stopped if they were publicly urinating on things (your example). D

I'd want them done for urinating in public. I wouldn't want any additional punishment or focus because it happened to be on a war memorial. And I wouldn't want someone publishing videos of them burning their own property being charged with anything.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Theories that I've heard: 

British farmers concentrated on selective breeding to improve the taste of meat itself so there was less incentive for British cooks to invent strongly flavoured sauces to disguise the taste of meat. A tradition grew up in Britain where meat would be served bare as it's flavour was the main feature of a dish, whereas on the continent the sauce was the main feature and the quality of the meat was less important. 

----------

Lots of foreign, mostly French, exchange students came over to the UK during rationing which lasted until the mid 1950s and we didn't have the amount or variety of food that they had. 

We continued rationing for much longer than we had to in order to be able to export large amounts of produce to countries like the Netherlands whose agricultural capacity had been devastated by the second world war.  We made the decision to make do with less so that other people could survive. The French decided not to do this, so next time a French person insults British food you may want to explain this to them. 

-------------

Another theory is that it's because our popular restaurant culture is very new, until recently good restaurants here were the preserve of the rich elite and most people ate at home, eating out was considered a last resort for anyone on a budget, something you only did if you couldn't get home for your meal, so tourists would tuck in to something like a pub lunch expecting it to be the best of the best as they were 'eating out' but British people would expect the best food accessible to the working and middle classes to be cooked in the private home.

I said through Scots *ancestry*, can you explain the 'Ulster Scots' language to me then? It's predominately used by citizens who identity themselves as British here. Some may see themselves as 'Northern Irish', but the vast majority see themselves as British (I can link you to hundreds of news videos, youtube videos etc with people saying ""*They took rrr fleg... Northern Ireland is British and 'ats rrr fleg, we're British people 'an err takin' rr fleg*"" or others like unionist politicians referring their British heritage or nationality etc.)

&gt; Not Irish as that has been a different country for many generations.

98 years is not 'many generations' compared to the hundreds, thousands of generations that lived under a united Ireland, governed by four separate kings, ruled by a high king. 98 years in some cases is less than *one* lifetime. Even before partition when Ireland as a whole was governed by Great Britain, its people were refered to as Irish. How comes now that only 6 counties are governed by GB its people are now by default, British?

&gt; I don't get this nationalist thing of referring back hundreds of years about everything. Can you explain it for me?

Unionists refer to themselves as British/part of Britain because of their ancestry came here during the Ulster plantations. Which happened hundreds of years ago. Completely willingly ignorant to the fact that Britain (Wales &amp; England), and Great Britain (Wales, England &amp; Scotland) is the island to the east of the island of Ireland.

I don't see how you can refer to yourself as British if you live and were born on another island other than Britain. That'd be as deluded as Indians calling themselves British during British rule there, or someone from Hong Kong referring to themselves as British during British rule there. We are simply not the same people.

First of all, The purchase and transfer of Varane to Madrid had absolutely nothing to do with Jose Mourinho. The club and Zidane deserve all of the credit, because it was Zidane who found him and recommended him to the club and it was the club who agreed and purchased him.

Also, if know anything about Real Madrid and how they operate you know that the managers don't have much of a say when it comes to who comes in and out, the board and Perez have the most power when it comes to who comes in and out.

They brought in Varane as a future CB and with or without Mourinho that was going to happen. Mourinho didn't put in any amount of faith other managers wouldn't have. Actually, to be truly honest he put in the bare minimum up until the point where he was forced to play Varane in a big match. When Varane had his breakthrough season it was entirely down to the fact that Pepe got injured that he was able to play in the matches he did. Especially vs Barcelona. Had Pepe not been injured he would have started and Varane wouldn't have had the opportunity to showcase his ability to the world.

While UKIP's immigration reform may appeal to racists, (most of them with only slight xenophobia, few like NF and BNP types), it also appeals to a huge amount of non racists, which form the majority. Labour's welfare policies attract people who abuse and flaunt the welfare system, but it also appeals to a huge amount of people who want to help the unfortunate, which form the majority. Similar comparisons can be made with all the other parties.

I am not denying that there are racists in UKIP, but ignoring them, and ignoring the cause of their xenophobia which is uncontrolled mass immigration, and them feeling as if their rights are being put behind the rights of immigrants will only lead to them intensifying their views, and parties like the BNP and National Front will gain a worrying amount of traction. This is now happening in countries like Greece and France.  By them supporting UKIP, a party with no actual racist policies and a far less extreme base than other far right parties, they can be reformed and shown the error of their thoughts.",1,1400953633,null,0,false,0,chq4da1,t3_26dgrr,t1_chq4da1,t1_chq3mfg,null,1433937497,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,mr-strange,null,null,"It's not the attitude to migration policy that's racist, it's the baseless scapegoating of immigrants.

The fact is that immigrants are *not* stealing jobs, they are bringing extra wealth and vigour into our economy and our public sphere. They are *not* causing our problems, and to *raise the subject* of immigration in the context of solving those problems is inherently racist.

&gt; Why don't you go through my post point by point and explain where I've displayed a prejudice based upon race?

OK...

&gt; Many people are upset with the volume and specifics of immigration not the principle.

Here's you core problem. ""Immigration"" is raised as something with which people are ""upset"". There's simply no objective reason to even raise the subject of immigration as a political issue, in today's Britain. Those who want to make it an issue are simply trying (and sadly, succeeding) to turn people against each other.

&gt; [they would] like to reduce the elements of it which are negative (low skilled immigration)

The framing of ""low skill"" immigration as somehow negative is again baseless and divisive. Why is competition for ""low skill"" jobs somehow bad? Importing more workers of any skill level is effectively importing jobs, which is good for everyone who lives here. That's why we have more people employed in the UK than ever before, and why unemployment is falling.

Far from being based on any sort of rational basis, the focus on ""low skill"" migrants is simply a fig leaf for singling out ""bad"" migrants (Romanians, Bulgarians, Poles etc) from ""good migrants"" (German, French, etc.). You will notice that [UKIP rail against even ""high skilled"" Bulgarians who might want to move to the UK.](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/376733/Millions-of-poverty-striken-Bulgarians-want-to-move-to-Britain) Why might that be, hmm?

&gt; If there is a choice between wealth and retaining a sense of identity, people will take the country overall being a little but poorer.

Here's the next lie - that incomers ""threaten our identity"" in some ill-defined way. We have multiculturalism in this country. Somehow we still manage to play cricket on the village green, sipping our warm beers. We still go to football matches, watch Dr. Who on the TV. Pillar boxes are still red. Policemen still wear those stupid pith helmets.

true,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,"&gt;1) Goverments with PR almost always have to form coalition governments in order to get anything passed.

I see this as a good thing though. The people's views are actually represented accurately in government and both sides try to come to agreements that are mutually satisfactory. As it is, a government doesn't even necessarily have to secure 50% of the public's votes, just needs more than any other party.

&gt;2) Far less policies actually get passed and those that do are almost completely watered down.

&gt;FPTP is definitely not perfect but it does allow a government to actually get policies through in more or less their original state, resulting in strong government (whether good or bad).

Following this line of reasoning, let's just get rid of democracy entirely and have a single party system. That way more non-watered-down policies are passed and we have a 'strong government.' 

I see what you're saying but the reality is that having to debate and argue over the details and practicalities of legislation actually results in *better* legislation, not worse - people point out all the flaws in it and they can all then be addressed as best as possible, and if the legislation ends up being fatally flawed then it won't be passed.",0,1400953827,null,0,1400954264,0,chq4ftk,t3_26dq6w,t1_chq4ftk,t1_chq41vs,null,1433937530,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

It doesn't have to be intentional. The law is to stop the public mistaking someone else for a police officer. Despite the mask, from a distance most of what he's wearing makes him look like a police officer.

The intent of the law is to stop people perform actions that the public believe were committed by the police.

So it doesn't actually require intent. If he'd been polite he'd have probably just got a warning and been told to dress in a way that wasn't as confusing. Instead he was a dick, and while the police officer may have over reacted, I'm still a little smug and feel like this guy deserved it.

This post is going to presuppose the existence of a facist party in Britain which was not racist beyond advocating reduced immigration levels while accepting democracy as the legitimate political system.

Fascism powerfully links the embodiment of the state with right wing feelings of nationalism. It effectively co-opts the left wing arguments regarding class and helping the people by standing up to special interests with a focus on nations and racial groups. They advocate a mixed economy to ensure national self-sufficiency and independence from others through protectionist and interventionist policies.

They tend to do well when people are angry and disillusioned with the government of rich people imposing unpopular changes during times of economic stagnation with an incompetant, uninspiring opposition.

What might these policies be?

Getting rid of the free movement of people to this country and replacing it with a points based system which only accepted people of significant economic benefit to the nation? Exceptionally popular as a policy [idea!](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/25/what-we-believe-about-immigration/)

Keeping the NHS nationalised and under direct state control and spending much more money on it? Quite popular.

Nationalising energy and railway companies? Exceptionally popular [idea!](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/)

Leaving the EU? Reasonably popular idea with 35% of people backing [it](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/03/26/eu-referendum-highest-lead-two-years/)

Massive increases in investment in infrastructure directly by the state? Quite popular.

Mixture of private and public ownership over the means of production? Quite popular. Holding up that companies, while striving for profits, should value the national interest above them.

So, I ask an awkward question. Is fascism doing better than it should be, or far worse largely out of the legacy of 1930's and 40's fascism which was so truly awful and disgusting, creating a taboo against the ideology?

I am a very bad libertarian, so naturally I dislike fascism because it tends to increase the power of the state. But on this subreddit I frequently hear people go on about how they wished the state cared about them more, took a more active role in the economy, protected british jobs. 

And that is the issue. I hear people frequently crying out for a left wing party acting as an alternative to the neoliberal status quo. Well, a fascist party would be a lot closer to that than the current labour party...

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Yes, UKIP are larger, but I still don't see a compelling reason why the Greens should be excluded. As I mentioned in another post, UKIPs inclusion in TV coverage as a major party was well overdue.

I feel the Ofcom rules which are designed to promote democracy and equal coverage of the parties, are actually restricting exposure to voters to the already large parties.

UKIP have been able to gain support through a single popular issue (The EU) by going against the 3 main parties. Now that they have gained popularity on that issue, they can cement themselves in UK politics by pushing their domestic policy ideas in TV debates. This is good for democracy. What is not good for democracy is excluding other parties with solid electoral support.

It's a symptom of the voting system as well, in that people tend to vote for the most popular party that they like, and not the one that most closely resembles their views. For instance, we have seen in the last two general elections that UKIP supporters have had to vote for one of the 3 main parties. Likewise we have consistently seen Green supporters having to vote for Labour/Lib Dem to keep the Conservatives out. The TV exposure somewhat legitimises the UKIP party and thus many people will stop voting tactically and just vote UKIP. The same can't be said for the Greens as people still see them as a wasted vote, which is a big problem in my opinion. It's holding back democracy.

We can analyse the issue more when the EU election results come in, as Green support is expected to rise above 10%.",0,1400954582,null,0,1400955297,0,chq4pk1,t3_26bpvs,t1_chq4pk1,t1_chq168w,null,1433937661,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Played in an indoor intramural game with a guy wearing a Walcott shirt a few months ago while I was wearing some Spurs shorts, and I started giving him playful banter as soon as he got on the court (rather benign stuff, such as ""Come on Arse-nal, let's see what ya got,"" and gave defending him a bit of extra energy, but all with a smile). He was a pretty solid player with some very quick feet, but he looked younger (I'm a grad student while he was likely undergrad) and appeared to be visibly rattled by even the most benign and playful of banter, and so in my guilt I cooled off a bit. The damage had been done though and his play just deteriorated from there. 

Shook his hand afterwards with a smile and thanked him for playing, but he barely even smirked and looked me in the eye. I felt bad, but what's the point of spending all that money on a long sleeve ""hero shirt"" (probably cost him in excess of $100) if you don't have the pride in it or yourself to take a bit of very lighthearted banter?

France did that. The rich upped sticks and left.

&gt;On the issue of employment, well mass immigration has it's benefits which is why I prefer more open borders, but it does also have a negative effect on many workers. I'm still pro immigration though as it's not immigration that's the central issue, it's employers using immigration to drive down wages, that's the problem- employers. They need to be brought to more accountability; a living wage for all workers should be established and migrant workers should be unionised to tackle this.

You mean the attitudes of Muslims in Egypt, and the attitudes of Muslims in this country.

This is a Muslim problem.  Look at the opinion polls for apostasy in the top 10 Muslim countries.

Even in this country it is increasing.  1 in 3 Muslim BRITISH youths support **killing** people just for leaving Islam.

&gt; Not massively - especially if it's your own property, as with the bloke done for videoing burning his own poppy.

Okay I don't agree with that.  I was responding specifically to your example of someone urinating on a public memorial.

&gt; Because we're talking about the EU elections and you're talking about Egyptian law.

Please don't get mixed up.  It's my fault for introducing many different points, but I've never mentioned Egyptian law (if I did, it was a mistake. I talked about laws of other Muslim countries, but not Egypt).  I was talking about Islam, and using Egyptian Muslim opinion polls as an example.

&gt; so I'm still (genuinely) struggling to see why you think it's relevant to this particular debate.

I'll break it down:

1. I don't like Islam and certain other ""non-western"" cultural behaviours like FGM, oppressing of women etc.  
2. I therefore don't want Islam and these other cultural behaviours to spread to the UK.
3. To reduce the spread of Islam etc, I want to reduce the influx of immigrants with this culture.
4. Therefore it's important to me to not vote for a party that wants to open up immigration further.

The game featured one of the first [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(computer_graphics\)) driving environments  via a simulator cabinet, rendered with a custom architecture.  The [force feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_feedback), car physics simulator, game design and most [game programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_programming) were done by Max Behensky. According to the in-game credit screen, *Hard Drivin'* was designed by two teams working concurrently in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland).

It's easy to be dismissive of the idea that fascism could actually re-emerge as a political force in Europe, but I think we may even see it in the next decade. 

There are many misconceptions around fascism, which muddles public discourse about the problem. A good documentary to watch is [this episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xoM6-1SWl4) of Adam Curtis' The Living Dead, which centres around the Nuremberg trials and is about how allied forces tried to manipulate the public understanding of fascism after the second world war.

Fascist political parties, movements and ideologies are on the rise all throughout Europe and the whole world. Many of these parties, including some in this country, do not explicitly self identify as fascists but nevertheless espouse the values and vision of society that fascism represents. 

Certain ideas, which belong to fascism, appeal deeply and emotionally to the psyche. In the public imagination fascism is so deeply linked with racism, intolerance and bigotry, that we tend to dismiss it as an ideology of hatred. Racism is such an obviously abhorrent, intellectually indefensible, morally repugnant philosophy that we cannot imagine it gaining wide public support in European countries, with our liberal socialism and human rights laws. But although fascism tends towards racism, racism is not an intrinsic part of the ideology. Fascism is not a philosophy of hatred, otherwise it would have never stirred and drawn in so many people throughout the 20th century and beyond. It is a vision of a better society, where everything is as it should be.

Most important of these ideas is the elevation of the nation-state to be the ultimate and highest form of social unit. A nation-state comprises of its people, with their shared culture, heritage and traditions. As well as being a place where a person lives, it gives people their identity, their self-image, and their place in the world. The exploits and achievements of the nation-state reflect and prove the positive traits of its inhabitants, and vice versa. A nation-state should answer to no higher authority, it is entirely sovereign, and as such is free to exert its will. Other nation-states may be tolerated, may become great allies or great enemies, but we are different and separate from them, divided by the very things that make us the same - our history and ancestry.

&gt;""Nationalism is the main foundation of fascism. The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity which binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people.""

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Nationalism)

Racism is, however, the logical consequence of fascism. Because if the nation-state is comprised of its people, then the encroachment of outsiders can only be disruptive and harmful. *They* are not with *us*, as they hold different allegiances, have a different culture and different values. When there are problems in the country, it is likely caused by *them*, because our nation is great, therefore our people are great. When *they* succeed in our countries, they haven taken something from us. If our state has provided for them, they have taken something that was meant for us.

&gt;""Racialism appears as an attempt to provide a concrete, would-be scientific basis for national unity. Cultural and linguistic differences are obvious, physical differences are more obvious, and hence more useful ... The demagogic appeal of racialism is too evident for it to be abandoned by the national populists of our time; but it would be wrong to connect it automatically with the doctrines [of fascism].

*Varieties of Fascism*, Eugene Weber, 1964

The public also sees the goose-stepping, all encompassing totalitarianism of the Nazi Party and thinks it seems something entirely different and distinct to nationalism. But the totalitarian state is also just the logical conclusion of fascist ultranationalism.

&gt;""The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.""

*Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions*, Benito Mussolini, 1935

You may not think that such an extreme view - that our human and spiritual values only exist in our connection to the nation-state - would gain any traction with the public. But I hear the nascent form of this view all the time from people I know, in the media, and online. Several times a week I will see a comment on the internet, often on this sub, that says ""there are no human rights, there are only privileges of the state"". Human Rights legislation exists directly and consequently to oppose and undermine this philosophy. Human Rights stands for the idea that our values and our rights are not handed down to us by a state, are not 'privileges' for 'true citizens', but are innate and inviolable, a moral obligation to all of humankind, is the direct antithesis of the fascist ideology. Whenever I see opposition to this philosophy, I find it very worrying indeed.",0,1400956290,null,0,false,0,chq5bl0,t3_26dt7h,t1_chq5bl0,t1_chq412s,null,1433937949,91,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,91

First off 'nationalism' is a false concept, to be nationalistic in any democratic system is simply putting your own people's needs first, which every political party in existence does, and has to do, in order to gain power. So the term is largely irrelevant.

Secondly, it is fascism which is on the rise, it just hasn't been able to take hold in Europe yet (thankfully). The best example is of course in Greece, where the Golden Dawn party is the third largest. Thankfully the authorities have cracked down on most of it's leading members who are, unsurprisingly, engaged in criminal activities. If Golden Dawn ever managed to achieve the votes needed to form a majority government you can be certain that their first act would be to destroy the democracy which gave them power, thus it is really fascism which is on the rise in Europe, nationalism is just a buzz word.

Finally I would dispute that these fascist parties are a response to left wing governance. They are a response to the economic situation many European states find themselves in, just as history shows us. Hitler would not of been able to come to power without the economic hardships (reparations) imposed on Germany after WW1. Economic hardships (not always) lead to fascism, pure and simple. If fascists didn't have immigrants to target, you can bet it would be another minority (Jews, Muslims, Gays etc), but these groups do not cause fascism, that is the economic situation. There will always be racists and biggots in society, but they are always in the extreme minority, they can only rise to power if the majority of people feel desperate enough to let them.

As for OP's worries, fascism will only represent any kind of real risk to the UK when the next large scale economic crash happens. Even then we will likely be okay as we are sitting on one of the largest networks of social services in the known world (NHS). When the worst comes to worst institutions like the NHS can still be sold off for large amounts of currency which would allow us to better survive economically than the rest of Europe (bar maybe Germany). Therefore the threat posed by fascism from within the UK is minimal for the foreseeable future.

I have fired the L85 A2(SA80) with a variety of sights fitted, iron sight, Susat and the new LDS. Also I've had the chance to get some training on the GPMG which is a belt fed 7.62 light machine gun.

With both weapons, I was really nervous at first and was worried about fucking up the drills or not handling them properly, I hadn't handled firearms before so to me they were a bit scary. After a few lessons on the ranges that went away and now a firearm to me is nothing more than a tool of the trade. You can have a healthy respect for something without being scared or frightened of it. 

I would say I am interested in firearms but I don't really see any reason for me to personally own one, I would definitely like to get into a gun club where I can practice target shooting though, it would be nice to be able to do that in a civilian atmosphere where I can just up for an hour or two and improve my shooting skills.

&gt;The __single transferable vote__ (__STV__) is a [voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system) designed to achieve [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) through [ranked voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems) in multi-seat [constituencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district) (voting districts).  Under STV, an elector has a single vote that is initially allocated to his or her most preferred candidate and, as the count proceeds and candidates are either elected or eliminated, is transferred to other candidates according to the voter's stated preferences, in proportion to any surplus or discarded votes. The exact method of reapportioning votes can vary (see Counting methods).

Pro: Able to pass strong legislation quickly, ensuring a rapid and singular response to a crisis.

Con: Unrepresentative and pretty much guarantees that small parties are much weaker. Also crisis' can be dealt with quicker but the solutions may not have much political support, resulting in people feeling misrepresented.

Proportional Representation

Pro: Much more representative ensuring that policies represent a broader array of interests. 

Con: Often results in coalition governments that are unable to pass effective legislation resulting in political and often economic stagnation. Also unable to react to *rapid* crisis' resulting in costly delays (See Greece and the bailout).

Yes. The critical words being ""in Egypt"", as we're talking about Britain and the European elections.

Do you have a link to that (and I mean from a reliable polling company, not from someone like ImmigrationWatch, or some newspaper's interpretation of the figures)?

&gt;I was talking about Islam, and using Egyptian Muslim opinion polls as an example.

Sorry. You're right. You were talking about Egyptian opinion and Afghan law, which is obviously much more relevant to EU elections...

&gt;Okay I don't agree with that.

You may not, but plenty on the right do. Where do UKIP stand on it? Presumably, as you seem to be so fixated on this issue, you'd stop supporting them if they were in favour of arresting people simply for doing acts that might cause public offence?

&gt;I don't like Islam and certain other ""non-western"" cultural behaviours like FGM, oppressing of women etc.

And this is where, in my opinion, your position breaks down. FGM, like most of the things that the press tar all Muslims with, is not practiced (at least not as far as I've ever seen any evidence for) by any more than a tiny handful of Muslims in the UK. Even a tiny handful is a problem - I won't dispute that - but tarring the majority based on the actions of a tiny minority is bigotry.

As I've already said, and you've not addressed - what people who happen to have the same religion, but who live in a different country, do is not relevant to what those in this country do unless you can show that these people behave in the same way. Immigrants from Afghanistan have chosen to leave that country and move here. There's at least a fair chance that many of them will have done it because they prefer the UK's attitudes to this kind of thing to Afghanistan's.

I'm not saying he's wrong, but I get antsy when people can triple a figure and then 1/4 the length of an effect to in essence, come up with a figure 12 times higher than conventional scientists would suggest based on speculation in one paper.

&gt;""It's the entire process of coaxing gas from shale using high-volume, slickwater fracking with long laterals from clustered, multi-well pads.""

Are you still citing multi-well pads as new technology? Mate my current platform has dozens of well heads and it's 30 years old. Long laterals = drilling sideways for a bit (been done for decades). Fracking - been done for years.

edit: I suppose the thing is, my four legged friend, that what I realise hearing the concerns about fracking is that while people think they're concerned about fracking, they're actually not.

Let's look at the allegations against it and have a run down of them:

""Earthquakes"" - Well tremors do occur, that's true. To what extent is still debated but seismological disturbances occur in some cases, yes. However they occur due to donor well reinjection, which is done wherever possible on any type of rig, and has nothing to do with fracking.

""aquifer pollution"" - No cases yet shown to have occurred but a very common complaint. Again, nothing to do with the competion technique and if it does occur is purely down to bad cement jobs or faulty casing, and again, cement jobs and using casing are routine things on every single well, and are nothing to do with fracking.

""Methane leaks"" - purely to do with maintaining wellheads, or lack of. Once more, nothing to do with the completion technique, and once more, every single producing well has a wellhead.

The thing is, while there's increasing opposition to ""fracking"" because of these alleged problems, none of them are actually anything to do with fracking.

true,Drake12345,null,null,"All right example time: 

You have an animal rights issue (lets say animal testing for cosmetic goods). Your government is made up of 50% of ministers who care strongly about the issue. 25% support animal rights and think the practice should be banned, 25% think that the economic benefits gained from the cosmetic company conducting it's research is too good to give up. 

The other 50% of ministers don't care either way, they just wish to exploit the situation to their advantage. So legislation appears before the house, demanding a complete ban on all animal rights testing. Obviously the 25%ers will vote either way. In this case, in order to pass the bill, this government needs a 2/3rds or 66% majority. 

So both of the 25%ers engage in politicking with the 50% of unconcerned ministers. The anti testing ministers convince 25% of the undecided to side with them, in exchange for guaranteeing support for another issue that they traditionally would not have supported. So already both of these groups have traded political favours in order to push their own respective agendas through. PR is already failing. 

The pro-testers do the same with the rest of the ministers. They agree to support something else in exchange for their votes. So we arrive at a 50/50 split. Needing 66%, both the pro and anti testers then agree to a compromise, since neither wishes to look like they've lost the issue. Eventually a bill is passed, that allows for *some* animal testings, meaning that the pro-testers make less money, weakening the overall economy, whilst the anti-testers save *some* of the animals from being tested.

Both groups have now engaged in politicking and must now vote in another matter in a way that does not represent them, whilst at the same time they have received a bill that now represents no one. 

This is obviously a very simple and somewhat extreme example. In PR parties must do favours for one another *constantly* in order to ensure support for their own bills. They must form bands and groups within the house to get bills passed, and those that are passed are generally so watered down that they represent no one.

This doesn't always happen, but more often than not in heavily split parliaments, it does.

So again, PR has benefits, but given the historical evidence located all around Europe, do you really think PR is such a good thing? If you do, that's fine, there is no right and wrong answer, there are merely perspectives. 

From my perspective FPTP works better, so long as you have a government you can trust. And if the government cannot be trusted, then I argue that is a problem with the people and their voting habits, rather than the voting method itself.

In PR you get a more diverse group of parties and ideas, with less power apportioned to individual parties. The Lib Dem betrayal as I like to call it, was down to the idea that party members should be forced to vote according to official policy, even if it goes against what their voters wanted. Lib Dems were essentially forced to vote against their pledge in order to match an agreement the party leaders had with the Tories.

In a more proportional system, The Torys and the Lib Dems likely wouldn't have had enough seats to form a two party coalition, and other parties would essentially have been able to veto it. This means further compromises would have been made until the majority agreed. It's also unlikely that without the Tories having so many seats, that the Lib Dems would have bargained away their election pledge.

The overwhelming advantage of PR is that people can vote for the party that best represents them, meaning the apportionment of MPs in parliment accurately reflects the views of the general public. This is without worrying about splitting the vote. I voted Lib Dem in the last election, as did many others I know. Labour lost the seat by ~130 votes to the Conservatives.

Currently, if I have an issue with something in the political realm, I can visit or write to my MP. With PR there is no ""my MP"". There might be multiple MPs, with large regional constituencies, so who do I write to? The one from the party I voted for? What if there is more than one of those, or even none (if I voted for a very niche party)?

Currently, I believe the UK political system neglects local issues, especially if you're unlucky enough to live in the consistency of a government minister, in which case you effectively have _no_ representation. I don't see the situation under PR as an improvement over this.

Personally, I'd like to see a better executive/legislative separation (by having parliament appoint an external executive), rather than changing the voting system.

If you want a Sandstone house (which many people prefer for the build quality and sturdiness compared to the brick houses), you will need about £150k minimum for a reasonably sized semi detached, and over £200k if you want detached.

After the 2010 general election a coalition between Labour and the LDs would still have been 11 MPs short of a 1-person majority and thus would not have worked. For Labour to have remained in power there would have needed to be a coalition between Labour, the Lib Dems, the Greens, Alliance, Plaid Cymru &amp; the SNP to have even a majority of 1. Not only is that pretty unfeasible in Westminster there's no guarantee that the SNP would have voted on issues not concerning Scotland (as they tend to do), and that would mean this jumbo coalition would have no majority (even if they managed to get the SDLP involved).

There were only 3 real options after the 2010 general election: a Con-Lib coalition, a Conservative minority government with Lib Dems providing supply, or a straight up Conservative minority government. A conservative minority would have been defeated pretty quickly a la Labour in 1974 and there would have been another election with a likely Conservative majority returned. A Conservative with supply likely would also have failed due to the lack of input the Lib Dems would have had on budgets. A Conservative-Lib Dem coalition was the only real stable option there.

Now I think the LDs did the right thing going into coalition, but how they've acted in coalition has been wrong.

PR systems are based on ""lists"", where if a party receives 'n' seats, the top 'n' people from their list are appointed. In some systems (""closed list"") the party writes the list and it cannot be changed by the electorate (this is the more common variation). In others, (""open list"") you vote for an individual, but this only affects their position on the list, making them more likely to be appointed. In ""open list"" systems (which is what I think you're referring to) you can still end up with candidates who received no votes being appointed (e.g. if one candidate received 10 proportions of the vote, 9 others will be selected by the party).

Where there are ""local"" representatives, these appointments are usually based on ""in which area did this candidate receive the more votes than any candidate that has already been assigned a locality"", which leaves the link between localities and representatives ""weak"" and dependent on the vote in other localities.

All major systems, including ""classical"" PR, STV, MMP(R) and AMS use lists. There may be some theoretical or unusual systems that don't, but I don't think you're advocating switching to a completely unproven voting system.

The UK system neglects local issues in a number of ways;

* Constituents of government ministers and ""shadow"" ministers effectively have no representation.

* Far too much parliamentary time is wasted discussing minor ""scandals"" in government departments, rather than actual worthwhile issues.

Both of these could be improved by separating the legislative and executive functions of parliament.

Let's take two extremes as examples:

Situation 1 - house prices average £10,000, annual rents average £1,000.  The only way anyone would consider renting would be for very unusual short-term requirements (e.g. temporary work secondment).

A lot of people were holding out for PR, were convinced that it was an expensive waste of time, or bamboozled into rejecting it by a very negative No to AV campaign that was less interested in explaining the system and more interested in scaring people into a reactionary rejection of any and all change.

I think both AV and STV are very simple. Everyone votes, and if no-one has a majority/quota on the first count then the least popular candidate is eliminated and everyone's votes get counted again.

The first person in your example would have just the same experience under FPTP. If they don't care who of the other candidates is elected then why would they complain? They are voluntarily disenfranchising themselves. As is their right.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;Currently, if I have an issue with something in the political realm, I can visit or write to my MP. With PR there is no ""my MP"". There might be multiple MPs, with large regional constituencies, so who do I write to? The one from the party I voted for? What if there is more than one of those, or even none (if I voted for a very niche party)?  

It depends on the system, but in many of them you would vote for individual candidates, rather than a party per se. In either case though, you can choose which of your representatives you think will best be able to represent your views.

Obviously I'm pleased that you feel able to contact your MP under the current system, but I'd ask you to consider the enormous number of people who feel no affinity with their MP at all. How many people do you think voted for their current MP? Say it's around 50% for the winning candidate in an average constituency - I can't find the exact figure right now, but I don't think that's far off. The turnout was 65% at the last election, meaning that *only around a third of registered electors voted for their MP.* There will inevitably be some who didn't vote for their MP but are reasonably content with him/her anyway, but there will be an awful lot who don't feel represented by anyone at all. As it happens, I'm one of them. What should I do if I want my point of view represented in Parliament? Write to my MP and try to appeal to our common ground? I might as well appeal to Father Christmas.

Under a system with multiple-member constituencies, the number who had a part in electing at least one of their representatives would be much, much higher. Firstly, because a far greater proportion of the votes are counted towards somebody's election in a multiple-member constituency. Secondly, because there's more chance that your vote will count for something in the first place, and it's highly likely that turnout would increase if people had more faith that voting was worth their time.

The proportion of people to have voted for an elected MP wouldn't increase to 100%, of course - as you say, people voting for generally unpopular niche candidates would still find themselves unrepresented - but we're not talking about a small incremental increase either. The idea of MPs as representatives is currently, for many people, a specious bit of lip service, but it doesn't have to be.

There are other arguments in favour of multiple-member constituencies, but I don't want to present you with a wall of text so I'll cut this comment here.

&gt; If they don't care who of the other candidates is elected then why would they complain?

I'd say that someone who votes for one candidate when they have the option of ranking cares more about the outcome than someone who ranks everyone.

Personally, I think that a cumulative voting system serves better. Particularly a system where one person can cast as many votes as they wish, but their ""value"" always adds up to one.

(e.g. I vote for 1 candidate, he scores 1. I vote for 3 candidates, they each score 1/3. I vote for one candidate 9 times and 1 once, they score 9/10 and 1/10.)

As a Canadian migrant (been in UK for 15 years now) there are a few things worth knowing, much of which has already been said but its worth stressing:
   
+There are some really good state primary schools and some pretty dire ones, your area makes a big difference but just being in a catchment area doesn't guarantee a place at your local school so if you are choosing an area just for the school, make sure they have places first!  We moved to Nottingham from another part of the UK two years ago and two girls had to go to two different primary schools (albeit both good ones) because they only one they could both get into was mostly about teaching English as a Second Language (which is great if you kids don't already speak English).

   +Have a friend whose son goes to the main independent school (The High School, which I think is becoming co-ed now) and it seems good, but its expensive.  Knew someone who went to the Girl's school and they rated that too.

   +Public transportation in Nottingham is really good, but you'll probably want a car to see outlining areas and the countryside which is a big part of the English experience.

   +Mapperly is expensive but really nice, central culturally mixed, fun and exciting place place (I live in the poor shite area right next to it :-D).  You can walk into town ('downtown') and walk back easily, which is nice.

   +West Bridgford (note there is not E in Bridge, crazy English!  They can't even spell in their own language ;-D) is still fairly central but you'd probably want to cab into town rather than walk and is its own community.  Its less 'studenty' than town, but also not as interesting in my opinion

   +Nottingham itself is very ethnically diverse (mostly Pakistani, Caribbean and Eastern European).  People seem to all live and get along just fine (at least I haven't noticed any 'ethnic tension').  The outskirts of Nottingham are pretty and picturesque but not very diverse at all (and in my opinion a bit booring but I kinda like being 'in the shit').

   +If you are at all religious, you are spoilt for choice in Nottingham (which is unusual for the UK who has something like a 5% of the population attend church regularly).  One of these days I'd like to do a 'Church Crawl' visiting all the Mosques, Churches, Temples, and Gurdwaras.

   +Unrelated to anything, but very useful to note, across the UK 'fanny' is a kiddie term for vagina, not a bum, so is a word best avoided :-D.  And if you wear a fanny pack, call it a bum bag :-D

   +In Nottingham people call each other duck.  So instead of ""Hey buddy, hows it going?"" you can say ""Ay-up Duck, y'alright?"" which takes some getting used to ....

&gt; Presumably, as you seem to be so fixated on this issue, you'd stop supporting them if they were in favour of arresting people simply for doing acts that might cause public offence?

I don't support the UKIP for other reasons.  But that said, a very common sentiment that I've heard here is that it's okay to support/vote for a group even if you don't agree with every single one of their issues.

     

&gt; And this is where, in my opinion, your position breaks down. FGM, like most of the things that the press tar all Muslims with, is not practiced (at least not as far as I've ever seen any evidence for) by any more than a tiny handful of Muslims in the UK.

Not sure why you think that makes my position break down.  Did you get the impression that I was hinging my entire argument on FGM?  I was just trying to give examples of cultural aspects that happen elsewhere in the world that we don't want to import into this country.  I didn't even claim that it was Muslims practising FGM.


&gt; As I've already said, and you've not addressed - what people who happen to have the same religion, but who live in a different country, do is not relevant to what those in this country do unless you can show that these people behave in the same way.

There are many behaviours that won't become apparent until there is a critical mass.  So you need to look at attitudes and beliefs.  Hence the polls that I've provided of UK British muslim beliefs.  We can look at muslim countries to get an indication of where things are headed if we get a stronger muslim presence in this country.  I'm not sure why you are so in denial about this.

&gt; Even a tiny handful is a problem - I won't dispute that - but tarring the majority based on the actions of a tiny minority is bigotry.
 
You have **seriously** misread my post if you think I'm basing this all around FGM.  Please go back and reread my post.

It's easy to use, sure, but it's difficult for a voter to work out exactly what effect his votes will have. Especially since the effect of his votes depends on how other people cast their votes. It's effectively ""non-deterministic"" from the voter's point of view.

&gt; You would be wrong in that.

The thing is, it assumes a certain amount about the voters' mentality that isn't certain. Someone who strongly agrees with one candidate is less powerful than someone who weakly agrees with multiple candidates.

&gt; Your system does nothing to help smaller parties with lower levels of support.

Why is that an objective of the voting system? If they have lower levels of support, then they end up with less votes. That seems fair to me. Since voters no longer have to give their entire vote to one candidate, it may ""help"" them, by allowing a voter to split their vote 50/50 between the favoured ""main"" party and ""small"" party.

&gt; Also seems significantly more complex to actually implement.

Not really. All you'd have to do is put a number against each candidate. These numbers are added up and each candidate scores (their number)/(total). If a voter just uses one-or-more 'x' marks, these are treated as being equal. If you wanted to simplify implementation further and avoid silliness, setting a maximum of 100 ""vote fractions"" per candidate seems reasonable, effectively making it a ""what percentage do you agree with each candidate"" system, making it more like cardinal/approval voting.",0,1400969139,null,0,false,0,chq9zk0,t3_26dq6w,t1_chq9zk0,t1_chq9ozf,null,1433940144,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,cocainesmoothie,null,null,"So before people begin to call me a Mourinho fanboy, I will say that his biggest weakness is that he sets up his teams for failure against smaller sides. It happened towards the end of his tenure at RM and it happened here at Chelsea as well.

Valdes over Cech since Cech's distribution is rather poor. Hazard is the only arguable player maybe making that team. Remember Barcelona requires a very specific type of players for their style.

Now. In the past 10 years Real has finished in the CL:

2004 - Champions League Quarter-Final

2005 - Champions League 2nd Round

2006 - Champions League 2nd Round

2007 - Champions League 2nd Round

2008 - Champions League 2nd Round

2009 - Champions League 2nd Round

2010 - Champions League 2nd Round

2011 - Champions League Semi-Final

2012 - Champions League Semi-Final

2013 - Champions League Semi-Final

So you can see how he made them a force again in the CL.

Past managers in that time span include: José Antonio Camacho, Mariano García Remón, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, Juan Ramón López Caro, Fabio Capello (1 La Liga), Bernd Schuster (1 La Liga, 1 Supercopa de España), Juande Ramos, and Manuel Pellegrini.

2 La Ligas and 1 Supercopa in a 7 year span before Mourinho. Very successful for a club of RM's stature. 

Onto tactics. Mourinho's time at RM was Barcelona's prime. They were simply unbeatable. But towards the end of his tenure he changed his tactics from ultra defensive (remember Pepe in midfield) to a more measured and precise 4-2-3-1 counter attack (won 4 of last 7 against Barcelona) that is both defensive and very very physical. Now I'm not arguing that Ancelotti hasn't changed it. He's opened it up to make it more attacking and free flowing. He's also molded it into a 4-3-3 and a 4-4-2 but much of the foundation that Mourinho left is still there.

Off the top of my head he's also been involved with transformations in the play of certain players.

Christiano Ronaldo was a 9 under Pellegrini but the position was far too limiting for his skillset. Mourinho saw this and moved him the the wing once again. The freedom in the wings had him scoring 40+ a season under Mourinho.

Marcelo and Coentrao both also became much better players under Mourinho. Marcelo in particular became a regular starter for Brazil and Madrid until he hit a bad run of luck in injuries. Coentrao will never justify his price but at least under Mourinho he became much more rounded out.

Also brought in tons of youth players it was something like 26 if I remember correct with Adan, Nacho, Rodriguez and Morata playing somewhat regularly.

Ramos was moved back to CB and has become one the best in the world. No question about it. It's also traslated onto the Spanish NT as he's taken over Puyol's spot alongside Pique. Not to mention that Mourinho's dropping of Casillas has led to Ramos elevating his game and becoming a more disciplined player and a much better leader.

Finally, you say Casillas or Lopez it wouldn't have mattered. Do you understand that Casillas to Madrid is what JT is to Chelsea? Casillas is a club legend and an icon to the fans. A Madridsta through and through. Mourinho must've saw his play was deteriorating and dropped him just as Ancelotti has except Ancelotti has had no resistance to it since Mourinho already did it.

Lastly he tried to expose just how parasitic and poisonous the club was and took control of sporting director duties which was unheard of at RM. Remember Mourinho VS. Valdano? Well he won that round and tried to keep on going and fix the foundation of the club but ultimately was rejected. He changed the culture of the playing squad and tried to extend that to the politcs and boardroom of the club but ultimately failed. It wasn't a smart thing to do but still, the man has balls.

As for ""he created so much shit, that it made it easier for the next manager"", yes that's exactly it. Ancelotti may not have full autonomy of RM. No manager ever will. But I can guarantee that Perez and co. have learned to not meddle with the locker room and squad to such an extent. Similar to how Roman has learned to largely leave football matters to Mourinho here at Chelsea. 

So yea, my 2 cents on his stint at RM. He didn't light the world on fire obviously but it also wasn't an abject failure like so many people make it out to be.

There is much to be said for cocking an ear to the inner voice that tells you that something widely assumed and fashionably repeated isn’t actually true. Three such claims follow:

1 Immigration from Eastern Europe is causing serious difficulties in the daily lives of millions of native Britons.

2 Huge numbers of voters honestly believe that the European Union is a major source of our biggest problems, and that leaving it would transform Britain’s prospects.

3 Mainstream politicians don’t “get it”. A kick up the backside will show them that they need to listen, address the anger and offer answers.

Mr Farage loves to assume the populist “excuse me . . .” and “sorry but . . .” voice of the small man whom the Powers That Be are trying to squash (yesterday he was not going anywhere, “I’m afraid”). So let me too try that idiotic voice:

1 Sorry, but I don’t believe that Poles, Bulgarians and Romanians are spoiling most people’s lives. I’m afraid I admire the Poles I’ve met, and (dare I say it?) think their work ethic and family values are good for Britain. Also (shoot me for speaking out of turn) I don’t believe I’ve actually met a Romanian in Britain. I bet (sorry, it isn’t PC to say so) their skills and hard work would be missed.

2 I suspect (they’ll probably drag me off to prison for this) that voters are being hysterical when they mouth off about Europe being the cause of our problems. They just like to have someone else to blame. (Is it heresy to say so?)

3 I’m sorry to let the cat out of the bag but grown-up politicians know it. I’ve little doubt (and this is what they don’t want you to know) that Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband secretly agree with me. They think all this rage against immigrants and the EU is tremendously overblown. But (aren’t I a naughty boy for spilling the beans!) they don’t like to admit it. Blow me down, have I said too much?

As Nigel’s Thought Police lay the axe to my door then, let me finish.

If the voters really think that the EU is at the root of our nation’s difficulties, the voters are wrong, and somebody should tell them. The EU is a fairly ridiculous organisation, but immigration and EU membership aren’t at the root of a sluggish economy, housing shortages, social breakdown and unemployment: they’re easy scapegoats for knottier problems. We should calm down about Europe. It isn’t very important.

People who want to blame poorer people from other countries for what they dislike about modern life are prey to cruel and erroneous thinking and we should not “focus on” their “concerns”. We should tell them that this is how racism starts.

Collectively, an era is as vulnerable as an individual to bouts of mild mental illness. Nations are susceptible to paranoia because rumour spreads and people echo and amplify each other’s fears until the crowd has forgotten what was the original harm. Nobody who goes about the country as I do, knocks on doors, talks to political meetings and attends party grassroots social occasions as I do, can have failed to notice that fear and resentment of immigrants does not reduce as proximity to living, breathing immigrants reduces. Ukip’s big Essex successes yesterday — Castle Point, Basildon, Southend and Thurrock — are all more than 80 per cent “white British”.

If anything, indignation bears an inverse relationship to justification. In my own party it increases, too, with age, and especially among those who are no longer earning a living but imagine — usually from reading the newspapers — that they speak for those who are. Immigration has had a more profound impact on London than anywhere else, so is London awash with purple and yellow? On Thursday London said “no thanks” to Ukip. Few in the Derbyshire Peak District have ever knowingly seen a Bulgarian in the flesh. But you’ll find more indignation about Bulgarians in Buxton than in Battersea. Somebody needs to point out these truths.

To take voters face-on and tell them why they are simply mistaken, to tell the vast majority who don’t run businesses why quitting the EU is so much less clear-cut than people long separated from the world of work suppose . . . this would be real as opposed to bogus “engagement” with the voters’ concerns.

I’m sick of the bogus kind — the assuming of a concerned face as the politician “engages” with the voters’ anxieties, “takes seriously” their opinions and burbles away with synthetic indignation about the hordes of Euro-scroungers whom the politician well knows do not exist; the “I get it” mantra, when all the while the politician is perfectly aware that it’s the voter who doesn’t get it, and that immigration cannot simply be stopped without quitting the EU, and quitting the EU would be so much more vexed a decision than most voters think . . . this pretence of engagement, this infantilising of the voter, is to me the biggest insult of all.

When I attacked Ukip on this page a few weeks ago some 900 online comment posters returned the compliment. They kept telling me I didn’t “get it”, that they were angry and they were numerous. Oh yes, I do. I get it completely. Angry, numerous — and wrong.

Yes, Ukip did well on Thursday. Yes, Mr Farage speaks for millions. But no, he speaks nonsense; and millions speak nonsense; and nonsense should not be indulged. Who knows, a political leader might even be respected for saying so.

What I'm saying is that the courts have made rules that make many actions illegal, and it's up to the police to decide when that's actually a sensible thing to enforce.

Do **not** be surprised if you get some resentment from any gay people if you just speak to Stonewall. To put no fine a point on it, they are not representative of the gay community at all. They do not listen to us until it's too little and too late. 

When they claimed ""success"" for equal marriage - equal marriage that they had been telling successive governments ""we"" didn't want, it stuck in some people's throat a little. When the community rallied around the boycott of the companies owned by the Sultan of Brunei when he decided to start torturing gay people, Stonewall told us we were wrong and they'd continue using the Dorchester. They said that boycotts don't work, and you have to engage positively. The community then decided to boycott stonewall, and low and behold, they did a volte-face when it hit them in the pocket.

Why is this better than having multiple representatives (assuming same area of representation therefore same number of representatives per person)? Why is having the option to contact one individual who I didn't vote for better than writing to someone who I might actually agree with?

&gt; You can contact them, whether you voted for them or not, since they don't know who voted for them everyone is treated more-or-less equally.

Only, they aren't, because you're writing to someone who doesn't share the same ideology; I write to my local Tory MP about making it easier for people to access benefits they'll throw it in the bin.

&gt; With multiple representatives, you have to ""mentally re-cast your vote"" if you want to contact someone, deciding who to contact.

What on earth is the issue with that? I have a selection of representatives to contact; I pick the one most likely to be sympathetic. Alternatively, I can contact them all. *How am I less represented?*

&gt; There's also a chance that multiple representatives from the same party could agree to split the area/workload in a way that you don't agree with or that the area is now too large for them to deal with every issue to the same extent.

If we take the same number of representatives per person as we currently have for FPTP, this isn't an issue. 
Unless you mean that I have to share the 2 (out of 10 possible) MPs in the area who are from my party/my voting bloc with 10 times the number of people, and therefore they're spread 5 times as thin as before? What a weak argument! That's 1/5th more of an MP's time than I would have had under FPTP! And it doesn't make sense, either, because I'm sharing the number of MPs with the number of people who voted for that party, and so if 20% of the constituency voted for my MP's party, and they therefore have 2/10 MPs for the region, then I'm only 'sharing them' with 20% of the constituency population - so I have a fixed ratio of MPs to voting pop (by default, as it's proportional!) so I physically CAN'T be worse off!

Even if they find some way to organise an issue in some exceptional, convoluted case such that I don't feel my view is represented, *how is that worse than FPTP is for the vast majority of people?!* This alarmism that, in some stretched conceptual possibility, things might be *as bad as they are under FPTP* is not a reason to promote FPTP over PR!",0,1400971646,null,0,1400971889,0,chqavr6,t3_26dq6w,t1_chqavr6,t1_chq9nhc,null,1433940633,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,emorrp1,null,null,"The 1st Account does *not* require direct debits, but will transfer any that currently exist on the dormant account.

When bank accounts quote ""Minimum monthly income £X"", it is *intended* for your salary, but as they have no way to know how your salary is paid, and can't assume the balance would remain for long (rent etc.), the actual T&amp;Cs simply require total *external* credits to the account over a month to exceed the limit. This means that once you start banking with multiple institutions, you can bypass this with a one-off effort to setup Standing Orders to shift the amount between institutions (i.e. Internal Natwest -&gt; Natwest transfers won't count).

So for example 1st Account has minimum monthly income of £1000, but your normal account it at Natwest with your salary of £1234 being paid in on the 28th of each month. You setup a SO of £1000 to leave Natwest on the 29th and another £1000 to leave 1st Direct on the 30th, in time to pay your rent on the 1st! Although this scheme might sound complicated, once you've set it up it just runs automatically forever - though I would recommend leaving more space in between payments for Sundays / Bank Holidays / Late salary etc.

There are two further ways to abuse this if you have less than the required salary, or even no salary at all: a) you have £567 salary into Natwest on the 28th, a £500 SO leaving Natwest on 29th, a return £500 SO on 30th, another £500 SO leaving Natwest on 1st, and a return £500 SO on 2nd; b) you have no salary, but do have a £1000 emergency fund you don't needed to dip into, have that sit in the Natwest account, with a bi-directional SO again at some point during the month.

If you end up having even more current accounts (I have 7 right now), you should use the same trick with staggered payments from a source account (and back) to each of the accounts with a minimum income - this lets you control each account seperately (e.g. TSB only requires £500pm) so if you decide to close one of the accounts it doesn't affect the others. I made the mistake of having a circle of SOs (with 3 accounts) which triggered charges when one transfer was delayed by the bank.

If this still sounds too complicated, then ignore this scheme and don't bother trying to hold multiple current accounts, just continue with what you have.",0,1400972469,null,0,false,0,chqb649,t3_26ehof,t1_chqb649,t1_chqa7ok,null,1433940770,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

So here it is

&gt; (1)Any person who with intent to deceive impersonates a member of a police force or special constable, or makes any statement or does any act calculated falsely to suggest that he is such a member or constable, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.

&gt; (2)Any person who, not being a constable, wears any article of police uniform in circumstances where it gives him an appearance so nearly resembling that of a member of a police force as to be calculated to deceive shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.

&gt; (3)Any person who, not being a member of a police force or special constable, has in his possession any article of police uniform shall, unless he proves that he obtained possession of that article lawfully and has possession of it for a lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 1 on the standard scale.

&gt; (4)In this section—

&gt; (a)“article of police uniform” means any article of uniform or any distinctive badge or mark or document of identification usually issued to members of police forces or special constables, or anything having the appearance of such an article, badge, mark or document,

&gt; [F1(aa)“member of a police force” includes a member of the British Transport Police Force,] and

&gt; (b)“special constable” means a special constable appointed for a police area. 

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/90

So let's look at each part:

(1) He clearly has no intent to deceive, so hasn't broken this part.

(2) His appearance was not close enough to be ""calculated to deceive"". If he wanted to deceive, he wouldn't have worn a pig mask.

(3) This is more debatable. Does his high visibility jacket count as ""an article of police uniform""? However I doubt many people would support the idea that wearing high visibility jackets is illegal, and he could easily claim that it was worn for a legal purpose i.e. satire, comedy, free spech.

I think the best thing is not to assume someone is racist just because they're anti mass immigration. Most people are just ignorant of the benefits, which the media and politicians rarely cover. If you want to change people's views I think open discussion is key.

There are many benefits of immigration, if it wasn't for economically active people moving here we could well be having to deal with an aging population, something which Japan, and to a lesser extent Germany is facing. Britain is predicted to overtake Germany as Europe's largest economy by 2030. As they tend to be economically active, immigrants put much more in to the public pocket than they take out (source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25880373 ).

Many people are ignorant of these facts, no thanks to the anti immigration propaganda peddled my a lot of media outlets, and I think public opinion would change a lot if the benefits were better known.

If you have the same area and representatives per person, then you only have one representative per constituency and therefore a FPTP system. For PR to work, you either need more representatives, or larger ""constituencies"". (Or you have a system where voting and assignment of representatives are decoupled, where you could still end up with no representative that supports your views.)

&gt; Even if they find some way to organise an issue in some exceptional, convoluted case such that I don't feel my view is represented, how is that worse than FPTP is for the vast majority of people?! This alarmism that, in some stretched conceptual possibility, things might be as bad as they are under FPTP is not a reason to promote FPTP over PR!

I'm not promoting FPTP over PR. I'm saying that PR doesn't offer enough benefit to overcome the risk and difficulty associated with completely replacing the basis of our democracy.

For the _vast_ majority of people, FPTP is no worse than PR. For a few, PR might be slightly better and for a different few FPTP is better.

Lallana is a good player though, no doubt. but for me it is about principle more than anything, and also I think its important to remember he is in a pool with other players who can fit the role.

So did I, that's why I was confused when you stated the opposite. If you amalgamate constituencies then each representative is responsible for a larger area and therefore less interested in specific local issues.

&gt; You've not shown at all that FPTP is better for most people.

I didn't say it was. All I've said is that the benefits don't outweigh the massive cost (in time, money, risk and legal uncertainty) required to replace it.

&gt; You haven't shown that PR would be worse for some

It's worse for anyone who wants to contact their representative about a local issue. Your weak ""contact everyone"" or ""contact the one they like the most, who may or may not care"" hasn't convinced me otherwise.

&gt; Almost every other developed nation uses some form of proportional representation.

Except of course for the USA, Canada, France, etc. Or are you claiming they aren't ""developed""? PR is really only common in continental (particularly Eastern) Europe and South America. Eastern Europe and South America aren't exactly known for political and social stability...

&gt; FPTP is a legacy system that keeps us trapped in situations like the OP linked.

It keeps us ""trapped"" with strong, stable governments. Is that really a bad thing?

&gt; Do you honestly think it's fair that 21% of those voters recieve no representation at all?

I don't think it's ""fair"" by the strict sense of the word, no. It's certainly ""acceptable"" considering the alternatives.

If I saw the Doctor Who teaser and didn't know about it beforehand, I'd still have no idea what the hell is going on.

I mean, really, such incredibly short teasers only work if the general public is exceedingly aware of your product. Outside of the UK, this kind of campaign isn't going to do much.

What we are seeing in the UK is a very mild form of fascism. A hardline Eurosceptic with some populist views is gaining popularity. Nigel Fromage also fundamentally believes in the superiority of the Westminster system - which has been shown to produce the most stable, accountable democracies all over the world. His 'common man' touch is just a gambit of sorts to endear himself to the electorate. He's really just a Thatcherite, who needs to use 'common sense' policies to get any media attention at all in our political 2 party system. I'm convinced he's no fascist, and I think have little to fear. In fact, if he gets his main aim of a referendum and there's a popular *no* vote, I think he'll happily retire/disappear and let the old left/right dichotomy of politics we used to have naturally supplant this centrist consensus we have. 

We saw fascism increase in the UK during the 1970s with the National Front. They didn't get anywhere politically, but it's wrong to claim they had no effect. Thatcher basically took all their votes when, in a famous [1978 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR9X6FkkOeY), she courted the far right when she said 'people in this country are afraid of being swamped by people of a different culture'. And so the NF disappeared from the scene - or at least back to the fringes. We've never succumbed to Fascism in the UK and we should be proud of having an uninterrupted centuries old parliamentary democracy. Even in the 1930s our very own Fascist, Mosley - who modelled himself on Musollini, never got a single seat and only had a few tens of thousands on members.

The same NF/Thatcher issue will happen in the next 12 months, when the Conservatives give their weak PM the boot and get in someone more in tune with the public mood, yet with a vision and a clear sense of direction.

Most people don't want to live on building sites. I wouldn't mind, because I'm a guy who doesn't mind spending a Sunday afternoon sanding the hallway and sleeping on a mattress. But for Susie and Jim, potential home owners who are looking to start a life, it's not always feasible. Especially if they have kids or pets or some other thing that costs them money to keep.

&gt; All of the moaning from people who say there's no affordable homes actually mean there's nothing affordable which is their ideal home, decorated exactly how they want it with all the latest mod cons that they just need to turn up, move in and unpack their suitcases. Its a symptom of the ""want it now, don't want to put myself out"" culture.

Sounds about accurate, nonetheless, it's not as simple as you say. It does take some serious dedication to own your own home without having to sell your soul to the bank. If you were on minimum wage, you could live in a shite area with under £300 per month rent, use a bike for transportation, keep all costs as low as possible (so no TV, playstation, Iphone contract, just a cheap laptop and a cheap internet connection for all entertainment and news) and in about 7 years or so you could probably afford to buy a reasonable tenement flat at a reduced price of about £30k if there was some minor work needed.

Taken as it is written, that suggests you oppose government interference in the labour market. I disagree, as allows us to have things such as a minimum wage, parental and sick leave, paid holidays, the right not to be unfairly dismissed and so on. If the contract was just between the employer and employee, these could not exist.

&gt;

&gt;__Idi Amin Dada__ (c. 1925 – 16 August 2003) was the third [President of Uganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Uganda) from 1971 to 1979. Amin joined the [British colonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony) regiment, the [King's African Rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_African_Rifles) in 1946, serving in [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia), [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya) and Uganda. Eventually, Amin held the rank of [major general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general) in the post-colonial [Ugandan Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugandan_Army) and became its [commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander) before seizing power in the [military coup of January 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Ugandan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat), deposing [Milton Obote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Obote). He later promoted himself to [field marshal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_marshal) while he was the head of state.

&gt;Amin's rule was characterized by [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights) abuse, [political repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression), [ethnic persecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_persecution), [extrajudicial killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing), [nepotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism), [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption), and gross economic mismanagement. The number of people killed as a result of his regime is estimated by international observers and human rights groups to range from 100,000  to 500,000. 

&gt;During his years in power, Amin shifted in allegiance from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable [Israeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) support to being backed by [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi)'s [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi), the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union), and [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany).    In 1975, Amin became the chairman of the [Organisation of African Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_African_Unity) (OAU), a [Pan-Africanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism) group designed to promote solidarity of the African states.  During the 1977–1979 period, Uganda was a member of the [United Nations Commission on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights).  In 1977, when Britain broke diplomatic relations with Uganda, Amin declared he had defeated the British and added ""CBE"", for ""Conqueror of the British Empire"", to his title. [Radio Uganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Broadcasting_Corporation) then announced his entire title: ""his Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Alhaji Dr. Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE"".

Come on, you're being dishonest. He cited a growth rate. 10 years ago, the Muslim population was around 2%. Now it's 5%. You can say ""not exactly a lot of them"", but doubling every ten years will quickly add up. You also need to bear in mind that the increase is not uniformly distributed. Those few percent are mainly in about 10 areas. And there are more than 20 local councils in the UK where Muslims are more than 20% of the local population. 


Sure it'll level out at some point and won't grow forever (which happens with most immigrant communities), but the Muslim population has been growing through large amounts of immigration plus higher birth rates than the UK average. Muslim children also have the highest adherence rate of any religion - meaning that they will likely stay Muslim, marry a Muslim and raise Muslim children. It's highly unusual for them to marry a non-Muslim, thus they remain more isolated and insular.

I don't have a specific problem with Muslims, but you'll find that many of the right wing votes are from people who are worried about the pace of change and not actually the presence of any Muslims at all. Some areas of the country are now Muslim dominated where they weren't 10 years ago. Is it really surprising that people who live in those areas are freaked out, feel overrun and want to vote UKIP or similar? You have to realise that not everybody is young and went to Uni and has lots of friends from all over the world. If you're an older person, all you see is shop front with weird writing on them, people wearing funny clothes in the street and your GP surgery waiting room filled with brown people. And you perceive all of that negatively.

And let's also be honest about something. From our more liberal-left point of view, Islam doesn't really play nicely with many of the things we hold dear in the UK. It is still a religion which does not value equality between men and women, one that does not respect homosexuals, and one that remains very isolated from the rest of the population - forbidding marriage between Muslims and non-Muslims, forbidding them to eat at &gt;90% of British restaurants which aren't halal. Stricter adherents will not even let un-married males go into their houses (i.e. at school I had a Pakistani friend but I could never visit his house because he had a sister and it would be a sin for me to see her because I was a guy (and non-Muslim too, making it even worse!)). It's a very isolationist religion overall which doesn't lend well to all the ""multiculturalism"" and ""integration"" we hear about.

And fwiw, I think people would equally care about Jews and Sikhs, but their population isn't growing at the rapid rate of Muslims. Polish people also got a lot of criticism when they came over here in large numbers, but people are gradually coming to accept them. There are many reasons for that, but mainly because they have fit in really well. Many have made a life here, they've spread everywhere in the country and not just a few communities, they do many different jobs, they date and marry Brits and have children together, plus they can participate in our social activities too.",0,1400984693,null,0,false,0,chqffiv,t3_26dt7h,t1_chqffiv,t1_chqa3tf,null,1433942778,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Add certain things into it and it gets fairly complex. A lot of Irish people would probably object if you said they were part of the British Isles, a lot of British people will identify only as English, Welsh, Scottish or (Northern) Irish, the Channel Islands have their own status etc. 

But the video gives a good overview.

Great Britain is the 'big' island that includes England, Wales and Scotland. The British Isles include Great Britain, plus the island of Ireland and other islands like the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which have their own  political statuses). 

Britain is short for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Or, what a lot of foreigners like to term it as; England. So Britain is the country that is the UK. 

Great Britain equally reflects the country also. See for example how Royal Mail's country status is Great Britain (even though they don't really need to use it).

I'm fairly sure a lot of my extended family round rotherham voted for UKIP, and they did so out of more than petty racism.  My grandparents for example, are probably UKIP supporters.  I think that they feel kind of left behind and that nobody in Westminster understands or cares about their opinions.  Yes, they have concerns about immigration and the eu, but people like the above columnist just bat these concerns away, like, how dare they even have concerns.  To just bat them away, tell them their opinions aren't legitimate even worth engaging with, is basically what the main parties are doing.  And it must be frustrating.  Poorer places in the north haven't really seen the benefits of eu membership or globalisation.  All that money's in london.  So all the 'immigrants bring in money' rhetoric rings hollow.  All they've seen is their home town crumble with neglect over 40 years.  So to be told their feelings on Europe are just flat wrong despite their subjective experience that it's done nothing for them can't be nice.

And the thing is, the above example applies to so many of their views too.  Suddenly you get Oxbridge educated politicians basically saying that lots of your values are just entirely wrong, and to even raise your concerns means that Gordon brown calls you a bigoted woman.  I mean that event is the whole thing in a nutshell.  Everyone in Westminster seems to think large parts of working class Britain are horrible bigots because they hold many non-PC views.  And as such none of the big parties try to engage with or appeal to these people, because of a fundamental divide in values.  Even the media smugly claims the moral high ground with articles like the one above, which is so stellar in its pompous arrogance.  A university educated man condescending so violently to a lot of people less fortunate and well educated than himself.

So there's a lot of alienated people without much of a political voice, who aren't just petty racists, with values totally different to those of the ppe brigade in charge today, whose concerns are ignored by the main parties and derided in the media as illegitimate.  These are the people voting UKIP.  Dismissing them as wrong and racist is easy.  Actually admitting that ukips success is down to the main parties deciding to ignore a large portion of society with whom they have nothing in common, perhaps due in part to the fact that so many politicians are from the same narrow background, is maybe harder.

If you want to manage in England there aren't many choices where you can go that allow you to be in the upper half.

There needs to be regulations, not on immigration, but on business. There needs to be a new drive for higher levels of education, and the education needs to be subsidized so that those in the working class can feasibly achieve a higher standard and adapt to the changing job market.

There needs to be adjustment for wages, primarily that of increasing things like the minimum wage, making it difficult for immigrants to actually undercut natives by making it harder for them to work cheaper. 

Obviously, these are very simplified.

I'm an internationalist. Of course I am, I'm Socialist through and through. But that doesn't change the reality that in modern society, immigration is damaging to a lot of people. There need to be real solutions that aren't just ""Fuck the EU"" and ""Towelheads go home"".

Jews and sikhs are relatively benign though there should always be concern about backwards religious practices like genital mutilation.

Since the 1950's the Muslim population of the UK has doubled every ten years. 12.5% of the population of London is now Muslim. A natural reaction is to be concerned about this development and it won't solve anything to accuse those concerned of being fascist themselves.
If 12.5% of the population of London were Russian neo-nazis, among them many who believed they had a divine mandate to murder homosexuals, others who wanted to turn the UK into a Nazi state, there would be wide-spread concern.

true,UndercoverFiretruck,1986,,"From what I've heard from Juve supporters, we've got a very, very minimal chance, if any, of getting him. Contrary to popular belief, him and Vidal play quite different midfield roles so it's not like one could replace the other. Juventus is putting together a strong team that looks set to dominate Seria A and challenge in Europe. They have no reason to sell since money is not an issue. Which would mean that the only way Pogba could realistically make the move is if he himself pushed for it. That unfortunately does not look likely either according to some recent quotes (I'll try to link later since I'm on mobile) he's released about wanting to sign an extension and focus on Juve for the foreseeable future and honestly I can't blame the guy. He has a bright future in a club with a bright future where he gets consistent playing time, a soon to be ridiculous salary and above all titles. 

Now if you ask me as a Chelsea fan I think it's for the best. Pogba is beyond a doubt a good talent with loads of potential but he's no where near the level people make him out to be in YouTube highlights and such. Not only that, but also the fact that he's not even necessarily the type of midfielder we should be after makes sort of glad we won't go after him. We need someone to unleash passes left and right and carry our attack forward while Matić does his thing. Think Modrić-esque but obviously it would have to be a more realistic target. IMHO, I think our priority should be Koke. Rakitic while being able to play the pivot is a much better ""10"" and according to Sevilla's president is unlikely to move. Pjanic would have been another realistic option until he signed a contract extension last week that most likely made his buyout clause astronomical. Kroos is pretty much the same as Rakitic (better suited to a more attacking role and Bayern unlikely to sell). People throw out names like Kovacic or Barkley (who aren't even known to play in the pivot) but if we're going to splash the cash then it should be on an established player who we already know is the real deal. We can be patient with the youngsters we already have, not with the star we're all expecting to solve our midfield woes. I think then, that the only realistic target is Koke. Phenomenal season of experience under his belt, young and yet established, and while he has been deployed on the right for a good majority of the season, he is perfectly capable and I'm willing to bet has the potential to be the best partner for Matić.

The Yankees could go out and buy a better shortstop if they wanted to, but they didn't they are letting the face of their franchise go out on his own terms. Dawson may be a bit of a stretch, but i definitely think Landon is still and has been the face of US Soccer since 2006... The only player with more caps than him is Cobi Jones, and he is the all-time leading goal scorer.... So if we are gonna make comparisions, for US Soccer he is the best player that we have ever had with the most star power and the biggest draw. That is Kobe Bryant level territory, the best solo Laker there has ever been. He is to US Soccer what Giggs is to Man U, and i think he deserves much more than being dumped off the squad for a kid who is younger than I and hasn't even played 5 minutes of Senior League footy. 

Also as far as Landon not scoring yet, the season isn't over, it ends in december, and started only 2 months ago. I will agree he hasn't been performing up to his usual standards, but he's far from done for this season. To the point about ESPN not carrying that kind of weight anymore? Did you watch the Lebron 'decision' or anything related to Tim Tebow, or Johnny Manziel? ESPN can make a no one a star in a second if they choose, or they can make a non issue into a front page story on every sports news outlet that exists in american media, and even non sports outlets... They pull so much weight esp with the casual fan that it actually does make a difference. I'm not saying it's enough to actually get klinsy fired, but it's definitely enough to get eyebrows raised.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I'll admit my knowledge of the EU is fairly shit

I've been meaning to give explaining the EU a go so I think I'll take the opportunity here. This probably won't be brief but I'll answer your friend's assertions at the end so skip to that if you want. I've studied EU law (and European Human Rights law) so I can give a decent run down of the history and functioning etc. 

The EU's predecessor, The European Coal and Steel Community was set up after WW2 with the express purpose of linking French and German (among others) access to coal and steel through an international organisation reducing their ability to raise an army against each other. Robert Schumann, French Foreign Minister, made [a famous speech in 1950](http://bit.ly/1ngyVGm) saying that we needed some sort of 'supranational' organisation in Europe to make another devastating war ""not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible"". In 1957 the Treaty of Rome created a 'customs union' on top of the ECSC - no tax was levied on goods travelling inside the union and the same tax rate was applied to goods coming into the union from outside. European countries were also cooperating on atomic energy meaning there were 3 separate but interrelated communities. They shared a parliamentary body and court but had different governing bodies. A treaty in 1967 merged the governing bodies of those 3 communities into the 'European Communities' and into the institutions we know today, the Commission and Council. The UK joined in 1972. In 1992 the Euro was introduced and the EC was again reorganised into 3 pillars of co-operation: European Communities (economic, social and environmental), Foreign and Security policy, and Police and Justice cooperation and was renamed 'The European Union'. In 2004 the EU proposed a new treaty which would establish a Constitution of the EU stating common European values, establishing the EU as a legal personality (which it had not previously had) allowing it to make international agreements itself, conferring new competencies and simplifying the system and overruling previous treaties. The French and Dutch voted this treaty down and it was abandoned. In 2009 the Lisbon treaty was proposed which instead of overruling prior treaties only amended them but fundamentally re-enacted most of the 2004 constitution. UKIP was formed in opposition to the treaty arguing it had conferred too much power on the EU. 

So how does it work? Well, as I mentioned it exists because the member states all signed [international treaties](http://bit.ly/1gsEaAp) agreeing to create it. Those treaties dictate exactly what the Union looks like and how it works. The treaties aims are set out quite clearly in [Art. 3 of one of the Treaties](http://bit.ly/1niQLaf). In general the Union is seeks to guarantee free movement in 4 fundamental forms: Free movement of goods, services, workers and capital. In other words the EU seeks to ensure that EU citizens can move goods to, provide services in, work in and move their money to other EU countries. This is effectively what the treaties call a 'common market' - economically EU countries should operate in the same space providing goods and services irrespective or borders and be able to move yourself and your money anywhere without prejudice. These were obviously aspirational when the were imagined and this common market is not yet complete. There are still things which prevent this market from being formed and have the effect of prohibiting market integration. For example ever wonder why you never see the government encouraging you to by British produce instead of European produce even though this would boost local farmers? That's because to encourage local farmer's produce you exclude farmers in other EU countries and as such this is not allowed by the treaties. EU farmers are not excluded from our markets and equally our farmers are not excluded from other EU markets. We have French cheese and wine while they get our Jaffa cakes and Whisky (their welcome!) and neither can prohibit the other. 

I've effectively just described a free trade area (no tax or other restrictions) but the critical difference between free trade and the EU common market is that in the latter the rules and regulations are harmonised and unified as well. If I sell cars in the UK and want to sell them in France then free trade is good - no tax or prohibitions. However if France requires tougher safety regulations or different materials standards I'm going to have to redesign the car for the new market irrespective of free trade. In fact this is exactly the case between the EU and US. Differing quality and safety standards mean car companies spend millions redesigning cars for each market - [NPR in the US did a great story on this](http://n.pr/1mHZqEh). Naturally this will put off  small business from trading abroad and will hamper economic integration in the EU. So the EU passes laws to make regulations and standards common across the continent to make trade easier. That's why we use the metric system, that's why the EU wants to unify our rules on 'bendy bananas' ([QI explains here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqVJEZnYiZo)) - to unify the rules and allow small exporters to sell in other countries with no problems or hold ups.

The economic stuff has been at the centre of EU policy from the start but the social justice, labour laws and human rights elements have developed over time. The EU has exclusive competency (member states MUST only act through the EU on these issues) over the common market, trade agreements with other countries, the Euro and marine conservation - purely international trade issues + conservation of international waters. However it shares competency with national governments on other more national issues such as energy, social policy, the environment, transport, consumer protection and public health. This is usually where criticism is aimed - EU regulation of issues that are perceived by some as purely national. The treaties ban sex discrimination explicitly. They also incorporate a ['Charter of Fundamental Rights'](http://bit.ly/1lL7IWA) which applies to the implementation of EU law but the UK negotiated a limited opt out of that provision. 

Just a quick mention of funding: the EU is funded by contributions from member states. That money is then redistributed to pay for various things: lots of agricultural subsidies, environmental subsidies, funding transport infrastructure, enforcing EU law, institutional admin, scientific research and regional economic stimulus for poorer parts of the EU (including Wales I might add). As such, poorer nations get more back than they pay in. We are a net contributor paying [£8.6 billion a year more](http://bit.ly/RozBv5) than we get back according to HM's Treasury in 2013 which amounts to about 1.3% of the budget. UKIP quotes a much much larger figure but it tends to quote gross figures ignoring the money we get back altogether in order to make the number sound bigger and it also includes the money we lose, *according their own calculations*, on EU regulation constricting UK business. I'll leave you to decide if you think access to a market of 500,000,000 people who all conduct business by common rules is restricting UK business. 

As I discuss law-making I should mention the institutions. There are 4 main ones: The Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The Commission has 28 commissioners, one per member state, and each is given a portfolio just like a cabinet minister. The Commission suggests new laws, drafts those laws and enforces them. It does not decide if the EU adopts those laws - the Council of Ministers and the Parliament do that. The members are not elected but the candidates for each member state are suggested by the elected leader of the member state. After the Commission suggests a law it passes it to the Council and EP to be scrutinised, amended and voted on by both. 

The Council of Ministers is a council made up of elected ministers from the national governments of member states. Which ministers attend will depend on the subject discussed. If economics are discussed the economic ministers will go, if it's the environment then the environment ministers will go. The Council alongside the Parliament will vote whether to adopt legislation. The bill must pass both before it is adopted. Each minister from the member states gets a vote proportional to the size of that state's population. We get the third highest number of votes therefore. The Parliament is made up of 700+ MEPs who are directly elected in European elections and it also votes on whether to adopt legislation alongside the ministers. The final institution is the Court of Justice which is the final legal court for matter relating to EU law. Judges are proposed, one per member state, by the elected national governments. 

The EU can pass 'regulations' or 'directives'. Regulations are adopted in the above way but are not subject to interpretation in national parliaments. They are effective immediately and simultaneously across the EU. Typically small issues of limited sensitivity are dealt with by regulation and also issues where it is important that member states have identical regulation to other nations. For example specific safety standards are regulated; the rules on what compensation you get should you be denied boarding on a plane or have your flight cancelled is dealt with via regulation. Issues as to the use of toxic substances in food production or in animal feed are governed by regulations. More sensitive and nationally specific issues are dealt with via directives. Directives effectively give member states a skeleton law to work from and the member state will then draft their own version in their own language meeting the minimum criteria of the directive. For example race discrimination or government processing of private information of citizens are issues dealt with via directives.

true,mush01,eng-yorkshire,Northerner in London,"Labour are in a weird position at the moment.  New Labour was the inevitable consequence of Thatcherism - it's sometimes been said that it was her greatest political achievement.  Functionally, though, New Labour happened by taking the Labour Party, removing all its principles and replacing them with a strong, charismatic leader who would keep the party together instead.  For a time, it served them well - but I don't think it's a coincidence that it's fallen to pieces since Blair stood down.  Nobody truly knows what the Labour Party stands for any more because the party seems to lick their finger, hold it to the air and try to get an indication of which way the wind is blowing before declaring any policy.  In a way, I don't blame them for this - it's what they know how to do.  The incredible party machine set up by Blair, Mandelson and their cohort ensured that whatever message they settled on would be laminated and polished and printed en-masse to the public; and yet somehow it doesn't work with Miliband's head on it, and I'm not sure it ever will.

The Conservatives are in a slightly different pickle.  Cameron is *kind of* the heir to Blair in that he had to turn the Conservatives from being an unelectable mess to being a party of government once again, but the problem is that he didn't really do that - the credit crunch did that.  Unlike Labour, you still know what you get when you vote Tory (tl;dr they'll cut taxes and give the poor a good kicking) but the leading lights of the party struggle to connect with the man on the street because they've so seldom seen one and even when they try, they are still thinking in a Blairite fashion - everything has to be shiny, plastic and stage managed.

And so strolls in Farage, the straight-talking populist with an ubiquitous pint in his hand, dragging an extremist shambles of a party behind him.  Every time anyone BUT Farage opens their mouth it's bound to end in controversy, but it never hurts their poll ratings.  For a while I couldn't comprehend this, and then I realised why - people generally are fucking tired of the stage management, the slipperiness, the spin and the double-talk.  They don't want the hand of history upon their shoulder, they're sick of difficult decisions and hard-working families, and they're pretty sure their kid has [never boomed anyone](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/apr/26/schools.uk3).  Even without the usual recession mainstays of immigration and a threatening foreign power, Farage would be pushing at an open door with a population sick to the back teeth of Teflon politics.  He's revived the old politician's art of persuasion, and used it to persuade people of things that - like the article says - are half-truths at best.  The problem for the major parties is that they can't compete with this in the way they've been doing politics for the last 20 years; in a mass-produced political world, the artisan's novelty is at a premium.

Seriously, though, yes - international agreements will have to happen some time. Without them, international companies will always be playing one nation against another.

It shouldn't be necessary to get *all* countries to opt in. Instead, regulate what happens on the boundary. A tax haven is less useful if you can't move money there and back.

Comparing notes with friends who went to private schools, later in life, I would say that the more obvious forms of violence and bad behaviour in private schools were lower - and punished more harshly - but that more subtle forms of bullying and animosity took their place.  

Personally, I hated every minute of my time at secondary school, and would have loved to be home-schooled, though there was no way that that would ever have happened. I hated it mainly because I disliked the other kids, and even though I was academically pretty good, by the end, I couldn't face the idea of remaining in education - since I imagined that college or university would be similar.  Clearly this had a vast impact on my subsequent career.  

However, even if I had not realised that I dislike the vast majority of people as a result of secondary school, I expect that I would have done later on anyway, so I don't suppose that it had too much effect on me as a person in that respect. No doubt it did fuel my anti-authoritarian feelings and various related characteristics though.

He did start a debate on the energy price freeze and the splitting of Lloyds bank into 2, both ideas which I think were poorly thought out but he did lead the discourse.

I suppose Ed's problem is that he is so unlikable, he doesn't fit that 21st century shiny, smily clean man (copying Blair); however he tries to be like that which makes him look very stupid in my opinion.

The only fighting that happened was between those who 'wanted' to fight e.g. two boys would disagree on something, square up to each other and brawl it out. I never saw anyone fight who didn't 'want' to fight. It was quite rare that you would see a fight. I think I saw a fight once between two brothers but it was just a bit of shoving and rolling around on the grass.      

As someone who had a lot of friends in private schools (I never went myself) I would say they are a lot stricter there. They were super tight on discipline and behaviour. I wouldn't say the behaviour was much different to be honest. The private school kids just tended to be really passive aggressive and rude compared to the kids I went to school with. That of course is a huge generalisation and I never saw the day-to-day running side of things.        

I loved secondary school and it definitely made me who I am today. It really shaped me and I consider it one of the most important parts of my life so far.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"You can never have too much information, right? Well, with that out of the way I can mention your friend's assertions. The 'governed by unelected bureaucrats' thing is difficult to answer because I don't know which part of the EU he is referring to and I bet he's not entirely sure either. Which part does he define as governing the EU and which parts are unelected? First on the issue of the EU being unelected; If he's referring to the European Parliament he's categorically wrong - all MEPs are directly democratically elected. If he's talking about the Council, again, he's plain wrong. Every minister or head of state who meets in the European Council is directly elected by the citizens of their state. In other words, and I think I'm right in saying this, nobody that is not directly elected gets to vote on EU laws being adopted. The governments of member states alongside the representatives of the people co-legislate. 

Now, the Commission is indeed entirely unelected. The only saving grace is perhaps that the Commissioners are proposed by elected heads of government of the member states but that's not exactly democratic by any stretch. The Commission has plenty of power being the only institution capable of proposing legislation to be voted on and being able to write them. Imagine the House of Lords being the proposers and authors of our laws but unable to vote on whether they pass and your not far off. On the positive end however Commissioners are chosen solely on merit not by family or donation history like the Lords so the situation is slightly better than that. The Commission hires about 20,000 civil servants to write laws and do admin which Eurosceptics might point to as unnecessary bureaucracy however for perspective that is about as many civil servants as are employed in Leeds City Council. Across the UK there are over 400,000 civil servants writing our laws and running our departments. 

Also the European Parliament has some significant control over the Commission. Unlike in the UK there is a separation of powers in the EU much more like the US where the President is apart from Congress and Congress may impeach the President and vote him out. The Commissioners, when appointed, must present their manifesto for the portfolio given to them to the relevant Parliamentary Committee. The Commissioner for Agriculture must present his/her ideas to the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture etc. If Parliament doesn't like the proposed plans it has the power to dismiss the Commission then and there. This has never happened but in 2004 the Commission had to make some changes to it's suggestions to appease Parliament. Even during the middle of a Commission's term the Parliament may, with a 2/3rds majority vote fire the entire Commission and replace them. The Parliament also has the right to supervise the Union. It can take other institutions to court, it appoints auditors to audit the EU budget and the European Central Bank President has to report every year to the Parliament. 

There are obvious criticisms of the Commission to be made and I don't see why the Commission could not be picked out of the Parliament or directly elected themselves - It may be that this is what will happen as time goes by. However there are some very robust checks on the Commission to make it accountable to the Parliament. Furthermore the entire history of the EU has been one of diminishing Commission power and rising Parliamentary power. Before the 1970s the Parliament was not even elected itself and only had a weak advisory role. These days it's probably the most powerful institution and still growing as it should. The direction we are heading is towards more democratic legitimacy and more accountability. Now is not the time to get out as these problems are being solved. In terms of being 'governed' by unelected bureaucrats that depends on whether you consider the Parliament + Council to govern or the Commission. Only the former vote on laws so I would pick the former and every member of those institutions is directly elected. 

Also the trade deal without EU rules is a fallacy - there's no such thing. Norway has a trade deal with the EU but is not a member. Does it escape the rules as regulations? Nope, like I said in my first comment, if you want to trade in the EU you have to abide by the correct safety regulations etc to be allowed to sell your products in the EU. Free trade is great but all that means is no tax or prohibitions on sale. However differing safety or quality regulations are just the same as a prohibition and Norway has to adopt most EU standards as it would if it were in the EU. It does manage to get around some of those shared competencies I mentioned such as fishing, social policy, environmental stuff but economically it is in exactly the same position as if it were in the EU. Besides, from my own point of view I don't want to lose the environmental, science and regional funding we get from the EU. We need to encourage green energy in the next 10 years and sadly the EU is having to lead the UK by the hand. I'd rather we didn't go our own way and descend into climate change denial (which is a UKIP policy by the way so you can see why they would be happy to lose the green crap). 

Does Norway escape contributing? Nope, it pays €340 million every year to the EU. How admittedly we pay 3 times more than that per capita but we also get a powerful vote on the Council as to what laws to adopt and we're represented in the Parliament. We would benefit a lot more, I think, if we actually tried to use our position in the EU to benefit us rather than resign it and have to adopt EU rules and pay a fee with no say in the matter at all and no representation at all all for the pleasure of polluting out cities more than the EU says were allowed to. I just don't see the up-side myself.

If you want to surround yourself with UofB students, go live in one of the student villages like The Vale and spend your time there, but it's only [6 or seven minutes] (http://traintimes.org.uk/uni/bhm/) from UofB into town, so if you want a more varied nightlife with students from all the other universities mixed in with students from the bajillion small colleges plus the townies it's worth the trip.

For the record, the unis here are...

**UofB** which has the most students, the widest curriculum and the best reputation for straight academics and as a research institution. Best place if you're after a stereotypical student experience.

**BCU** which has almost as many students as UofB, but because they're spread out across multiple campuses over the city, it doesn't *feel* like as many. BCU is a former polytechnic carving a name out for itself in media: TV production and online journalism and what have you.

**UCB** is about half the size of UofB and doesn't have a strong reputation for straight academics. They specialise in vocational courses centred on the food, tourism and leisure industries. They do have a decent graduate employment rate, though., not to be sniffed at in this economic climate.

**Aston** is smaller again, with a less diverse curriculum than UofB, but punches above its weight with a great reputation for stuff like law, maths and chemical engineering. The students have a rep for being a bit humourless, but Christ they can drink. 

(There's also **Newman**, but it's tiny and miles away from the city centre so nobody counts it.)

&gt;Mata left because Roman decided to push Willian into the team.

so you're saying roman kicked one of his rumoured favoured players out so he could have willian? sure roman worked his magic to sign him from a russian friend, this doesn't mean mourinho didn't want him. if you look at out mourinho likes to play (counter attacking) and compared against mata and willian its easy to see why he likes willian.
&gt;Do you really think all of them thought Torres was just the better man to start over Sturridge and Lukaku?

simple answer yes. sturridge didn't fit the system we had at the time and with RDM and FSW only on short contracts and not given any assurances of any long term involvement why would they play a not yet proven striker who just turned 19 in the PL over a proven goal scorer (admittedly not at chelsea) in torres. sure he doesn't score this doesn't mean he is terrible. he suited Liverpools system with Xabi and gerrard providing through balls and since his injury i think he lost some pace and this combined with a different style of play has contributed to his downfall. IMO he is a better player then lukaku. this isn't to say romelu won't grow into an amazing player.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"There is no question that past decade was not the best for Real Madrid. A lot it had to do with terrible purchases done by Calderon. 

Mourinho had a lesser squad with Inter that beat that Barca team the previous season. Not so unbeatable. Every counter-attack has pretty much the same ""foundation"" when defending. The difference is the counter it self. RMs counter now is completely different from Mourinho.

Ronaldo is going to score in whatever position he is in, which is what happened under Pellegrini. Because he is Ronaldo. He was unable to score 40 because he didn't play enough. He was injured. 33 goals, in just 35 apps. 

As far as Ramos, it was also Pellegrini that started to move him back to CB. In fact, in Mourinhos first season, Ramos still split time as a CB and RB.

Youth development was absolute failure in Madrid under Mourinho. It was not until his last season when he started benching everyone that he finally gave the likes of Nacho and Morata a chance.

And about Adan, he was absolutely horrific. He even refused to play Casillas when he was finally fully fit and continued with a struggling Adan. That is no longer benching a deteriorating player, that is just being petty.

Casillas or Lopez, it just does not matter much at all. Both are more than capable. Is Lopez ahead of Casillas? Debatable. It just doesn't make much of a difference. Real Madrid would have been perfectly fine without the drama created with the Casillas fiasco. 

Now, it goes without saying that Mourinho has helped improve certain players during his tenure in RM. That is absolutely true. But, that's what a good manager does. It should be expected. Look at what Ancelloti has done with Di Maria and to a lesser extent Modric. Modric was already amazing, just was unable to show it under Mourinho.

How much credit do you give Mancini with Inter? They too didn't win under Mourinho came. Won multiple league titles, no European success. Mourinho comes in and wins the Champions league. Much like Ancelotti did with Real Madrid.

Mourinho poke his nose where it doesn't belong. Barca is run the same with its politics and they seem to be fine. Just do what you are hired to do.

Whilst living away from the uni can be a bit of a pain, it's nice having the work-life separation and the bus journey really isn't that bad.

true,ceelo_purple,null,null,"I didn't go to a private school, but I did attend both a selective grammar school and a state comprehensive during my secondary education. (I swapped prior to my exams, because the grammar were really strict about what combination of subjects I could do and I was equally adamant about what subjects I wanted to do.)

The main differences I noted were:

At the grammar school, I was with the same class of kids for every lesson which gave things a very different social dynamic to the state school, where a higher number of pupils with a broader range of academic needs mean that I would be with one group of kids for Maths, a different one for English, another group for Science and so on.

That system meant you had to put more effort into making friends at the state school and you ended up with a larger number of friends who you weren't quite as close to. I think for somebody really shy it would have been easy to become quite isolated under that system.

By contrast at the grammar school, you knew all the kids in your class really well - even the ones you disliked. You were expected to have a best mate and there was no way to casually drift away from a friend you'd stopped having anything in common with. When friendships exploded they did so spectacularly with everybody knowing your business and taking sides.

On the other hand, remaining as a unit for every lesson meant the class developed a real solidarity against the teachers and led to us playing some amazing practical jokes on them. You couldn't have done that in my state school, at best it would have been one person playing a joke and hoping nobody dobbed them in.

Another difference was in the facilities. Technically the grammar school was supposed to be for bright kids, but because of a variety of boring social and economic reasons it tended to be full of middle class kids whose parents had paid for extra tuition so that they could pass the entrance exam. I was one of only three working class kids in my class group. This meant there were a bunch of reasonably wealthy parents who helped with fund drives for equipment and extra curriculars. 

It was a real shock to the system moving to the state school and seeing how little they had to work with. I'd spent most of my time at the grammar being a bit chippy, so it felt ever so weird going to the state and realising I'd become a bit of a snob on that front without realising it.

In terms of the teaching, I actually think I got better quality teaching at the state school than the grammar school. In fact, I got the sense that the teachers in the grammar were after an easy life and wouldn't have been able to hack it in a state school. Yes, the grammar had better exam results, but they were pre-selecting for bright children (and/or children whose parents were prepared to pay for extra tuition), so of course those kids will do better on the exams. In terms of whether teachers were prepared to answer questions from outside the curriculum, talk to students individually and address their needs, to go above and beyond the call of duty or even just to really seem to love their subject matter, the state school won on every single count. When the state school didn't have enough take-up for a course I wanted to do, one of the teachers offered to teach the course after school in his spare time and get the eight of us who wanted to do it through the exams. (So we all ended up with one more GCSE than the rest of our year group. Mr Saunders, you are a legend. Compare that to the you must study one subject from column A another from column B conformist bullshit that I got at the grammar school.)

In terms of fistfights, they were slightly more common at the state school, while not being *common* by any means. My group of friends worked in the school library and included two gay lads, going by stereotype we should have spent our lives being bullied, but it didn't happen because we had basically nothing to do with any of the kids who were into fighting. In a large school it's pretty easy to avoid people. The closest I came to a fistfight was being told that some kid I'd never heard of wanted to fight me outside the school gates one day. (It was cancelled when it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.)

I'd sooner that than the situation at grammar school where you might not get hit, but if somebody took a dislike to you, they could turn your entire class against you potentially for years.

Bullying was another matter but was largely psychological as opposed to getting beaten up. I hate to say it but your mother was probably a little bit deluded about how bad it is.

I didn't go to a private school, but our school bordered with one so we interacted with them a fair bit. Honestly in my experience they were largely the same as us, not even as posh as everyone would have you believe. The one near me had a large contingent of Chinese and Russian students, and *supposedly* they had turf wars between the dorms and would shoot out each other's windows with air rifles and stuff. It made the news a few times so it must have been at least based in reality, but the rumours were that literally all of them were members of their respective mafias. It was probably just good old fashioned racism. The standard of teaching in a private school is meant to be higher and I believe it, although I have no experience.

Which I've addressed - if you can show that these people are bringing the attitudes of the state that they've left behind with them, and are attempting to get those attitudes acted on in this country, as opposed to for example leaving that country partly because they don't agree with those attitudes then it becomes relevant. Until then, the penal code in Afghanistan is not relevant to this debate at all.

&gt;http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/living-apart-together-british-muslims-and-the-paradox-of-multiculturalism

Ah, Policy Exchange - a neocon think tank run by current and old right wing Tory MPs (Francis Maude, Archie Norman and Nicholas Boles) with the purpose of shaping Tory policy - so, failing on the reliable front. But let's look at the details - questionnaires of around 1000 people, and interviews with 40 of them in a small selection of cities. I've looked at the raw numbers, and it's a total of 308 people who agreed with that statement. So you are judging the attitudes of over a million Brits based on the views of 308 people selected by a right wing think tank. I'd hardly call that that comprehensive survey. 

I'm not going to deny that there's a problem with radicalisation, or that it's growing. But outside of very small surveys by think tanks with an agenda to push, I see very little real evidence of this being anywhere near the level of problem that it's made out to be in the press. And in my view the primary cause of the increase in radicalisation is not new immigrants coming over - it's the ever-increasing anti-Muslim sentiment in the press and in politics. If the politicians and the media keep presenting Islam as the enemy, then it's not too surprising that some of them start seeing themselves that way.

&gt;I don't support the UKIP for other reasons

Fair enough - as I'd been talking about UKIP voters, I'd assumed that you were coming in as an example of one of them. Would it be impolite to ask which way you did vote?

&gt;But that said, a very common sentiment that I've heard here is that it's okay to support/vote for a group even if you don't agree with every single one of their issues.

This seemed to be a fairly significant issue for you though. Prosecuting people for offending others was the single issue (beyond the death penalty in Afghanistan) that you brought up in your initial posts. Is it not that important to you?

&gt;Did you get the impression that I was hinging my entire argument on FGM? 

Nope. Which is why I included the statement ""like most of the things that the press tar all Muslims with""

&gt;No, because the Westboro Baptish church is not a large part of Christianity. 

They are, or at least claim to be, Christians. and I think most people agree that blaming all Christians because of the beliefs of others who claim to share the same faith is bad. Yet people are happy to do it when it comes to Muslims.

And if you want to talk about more widespread Christian beliefs - homosexuality is persecuted in large parts of the Christian world because of supposed Christian teachings. Abortion clinics are regularly attacked in the states because of supposed Christian teachings. Aids spread like wildfire in countries where use of condoms was condemned by supposed Christian teachings. We don't condemn anyone who claims to be a Christian in this country because of these things.

Anyway, having discussed all of this anti-Muslim sentiment, the primary driver of UKIP (as opposed to BNP) support at the last election was fear mongering about the EU and immigrants from Eastern Europe, a topic we've not even touched on.",0,1401007739,null,0,false,0,chqlhwv,t3_26b18y,t1_chqlhwv,t1_chq9x47,null,1433945707,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

- Extreme nationalism. The two policies I guess that could apply here are not being in the EU and limiting immigration to a tough points system. The first is held by the current government of Iceland and the second is held by the current government of Canada. i.e. not extreme levels.
- Ethnocentrism. I know the left likes to make this argument too, but even if we accept UKIP has prejudices here, the reality is that they want to have a points system that is equal to all races. They also have black and Asian candidates, which far right parties do not. 
- Anti-communism. This hasn't been a part of UKIP's push at all, other than the normal opposition to communism when describing history. 
- Anti-parliamentarism. UKIP actually support parliamentary democracy strongly, and critique parliament's loss of power to the EU
- Anti-pluralism. UKIP clearly support pluralist democracy.
- Militarism. UKIP are actually on the isolationist side of things, and opposed military intervention in Libya and Syria.
- Law and order thinking. This one seems fair.
- A demand for a strong political executive. Entirely absent in UKIP's thinking.
- Anti-Americanism. Again, absent.
- Cultural pessmism. This one seems fair.

I remember in my village around 15-20 years ago (so obviously much smaller than Bradford, but this is just an example), two of the three shops in the village got taken over by families from India. At first, locals refused mostly to go to the shops and went to the other shop - then slowly they saw the benefits of the other shops (better range in one, other was only to sell newspapers and lottery), but there was still the odd incident. I remember it being completely normal, and I assumed not racist, to call them the 'Paki Shops' because that's what everyone around me called them, and even today I still sometimes hear it (mostly it's reverted back to the old names of the shops). Today, though, they're both respected members of the community who, compared to barely any 20 years ago, now speak really good English, their kids speak perfect English and they help out a lot on local events. 

However, I've seen similar dismissal and name calling (and some vandalism) against the Polish shop that opened in the nearby town. But I imagine, in a similar time span, they'll speak English (however much they don't seem to today) and be part of the community, like the people from India and Pakistan (who arrived 20+ years ago) are today (for the most part).

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"Perhaps part of the issue is that it is easy to view 'immigrants' as a sort of faceless group, rather than a group of individuals. I suspect that this is why UKIP gets more support outside London, if your co-workers, friends and neighbors have been born all over the world than you see them as people not a sinister group. For example, when I was at university only a small number of the people in my degree group were white British ( maybe 10%?). But grouping everyone else together in a 'immigrant' group is bizarre after you meet them, the loud exchange girl from New York was completely different to the quiet guy from Hong Kong. Once you start seeing them as individuals the whole immigrant rhetoric feels very different. You can relate to them and understand where they are coming from, realising that they are not cackling over their unemployment benefits / stealing jobs, and they didn't get here on the underside of a lorry. I remember a Chinese student telling me she had to register at a police station after arriving, which seemed weird. She was a 5 ft 2 accounting student, is she really a danger to the country?
 
Plus, a lot of the donations come from overseas, I don't think the Sheikh Zayad theatre was built with British money. 

The voluntary segregation where individual communities of immigrants develop in isolation is not helping this issue. For example, around Drummond Street there is a huge Indian community and in Stamford Hill there is a big Hasidic Jewish community. For a lot of people it must be bizarre to have a area of London that feels closer to Tel Aviv than a UK city.  I can completely sympathise with immigrants wanting to live with other immigrants from the same country of origin, but if I was living in such an area it would be weird. In particular, the fact that there are single faith schools where there are people growing up almost completely isolated is not a good idea IMO.

My own old post from a few months back:

&gt;So some quick sums:

&gt;To cover 18bn increase in defence spend (40% of 46bn), 8bn in cuts to combined NI/Income tax revenue (from combined 32% to 31%), 50bn from cutting employers contribution to NI (my estimate of half), 4bn to double number of prison spend. Means they are looking at finding 76bn through Welfare cuts, VAT raises, and corp tax raises.

&gt;Even if they halved welfare, by halving unemployment payments (saving 31bn) with their basic cash benefit, and halving social exclusion benefits to the especially vulnerable (including sending the buggers back or however they word it). They'd still need to raise another 40ish bn, from VAT and Corp tax.

&gt;That would be something like 25bn by raising VAT to 25%! and 15 bn from raising corp tax by 4% to 24% to small businesses, or 31% to large.

&gt;This is, of course, if none of those raises and cuts, affects economic output negatively. Disclaimer These calcs carried out by a non-economist, on the back of a metaphorical fag packet, to give rough estimate, based on cuts and savings outlined in the OP article 
(edit this was originally posted to this: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments).

Which I have been.

Where is your evidence that they aren't bring those attitudes with them?

     

&gt; Ah, Policy Exchange - a neocon think tank run by current and old right wing Tory MPs

Ah yes, attack the source.

&gt; So you are judging the attitudes of over a million Brits based on the views of 308 people selected by a right wing think tank. I'd hardly call that that comprehensive survey. 

Did you ever take statistics?  308 people is a decent sample size to do a population estimate.

And where is your data?

&gt; But outside of very small surveys by think tanks with an agenda to push, I see very little real evidence of this being anywhere near the level of problem that it's made out to be in the press.

Okay this is very interesting.  So you:

1. Reject and ignore the evidence that I've provided you
2. Provided absolutely no evidence for your view
3. Remain stuck on your idea.

This is pretty funny, given that this conversation started because you complained at other people refusing to listen to your evidence!

&gt; Would it be impolite to ask which way you did vote?

Libdem was the only that was close to my views, but I just couldn't bring myself to vote for them because they want to privatize the NHS, and voted to triple student fees after promising to eliminate them entirely.  So in the end I didn't vote for anyone.

&gt; This seemed to be a fairly significant issue for you though.

Immigration and the spread of Islam in this country?  Yeah sure.  I'd rank it in my top 5 or so.

&gt; Prosecuting people for offending others was the single issue (beyond the death penalty in Afghanistan) that you brought up in your initial posts.

Uh, no.  The main issue that I had was killing people for apostasy.  Something that around half all of Muslims support, and is unanimously supported by both of the main Islamic sects.

Please hang around in /r/exmuslim for a few days to understand why I dislike Islam.  Again, you might not agree with my conclusions, but I'd like you to understand where I'm coming from.

&gt; They are, or at least claim to be, Christians. and I think most people agree that blaming all Christians because of the beliefs of others who claim to share the same faith is bad. 

They are not a majority view.  Your analogy should be closer to ""You shouldn't blame nazi members for the actions of the nazi group"", at which point I'd disagree with that too.

&gt; And if you want to talk about more widespread Christian beliefs - homosexuality is persecuted in large parts of the Christian world because of supposed Christian teachings.

Another reason to limit immigration.

I have my own beefs with Christianity, and in fact I attack Christianity far more than Islam.  But Islam is objectively a much worse religion because of how it was formed.

&gt; Abortion clinics are regularly attacked in the states because of supposed Christian teachings.

How does is that relevant to whether we should allow in immigrants?

&gt; We don't condemn anyone who claims to be a Christian in this country because of these things.

Simply because Christianity itself is a bit too broad.  The attack on condom use is catholic-specific thing.  And I certainly attack Catholics because of it.  (There's no hypocrisy here for apostasy and Islam, because some 85%-95% of Muslims identify with a sect whose Imams unanimously agree on death for apostasy).

&gt; Anyway, having discussed all of this anti-Muslim sentiment, the primary driver of UKIP (as opposed to BNP) support at the last election was fear mongering about the EU and immigrants from Eastern Europe, a topic we've not even touched on.

I don't personally particularly care about Eastern Europe, unless we are talking about Turkey.  For eastern Europe minus Turkey, I could be easily persuaded either way if presented with facts and reasons.  But Turkey has to be treated as a topic on its own, because it's in a fairly unique position.

Have you ever had to deal with someone, like a post office clerk or something, who just won't help you and also happens to be your only point of contact? That's not a virtue!

Often the fights were between friends and even if they weren't the boys (and I'll add girls in here too as they weren't totally innocent) usually walked away with a mutual understanding of each other and sometimes respect. I'm not saying that these fights were a good idea but sometimes they just wanted it out of their system.

I had an ex who went to a private school and she said there wasn't fighting but there was bullying. Psychological bulling which in my opinion is much much worse.

I posted a longer post earlier today, so I'll copy paste here. It was about immigration of Muslims:

&gt;10 years ago, the Muslim population was around 2%. Now it's 5%. You can say ""not exactly a lot of them"", but doubling every ten years will quickly add up. You also need to bear in mind that the increase is not uniformly distributed. Those few percent are mainly in about 10 areas. And there are more than 20 local councils in the UK where Muslims are more than 20% of the local population.

&gt;Sure it'll level out at some point and won't grow forever (which happens with most immigrant communities), but the Muslim population has been growing through large amounts of immigration plus higher birth rates than the UK average. Muslim children also have the highest adherence rate of any religion - meaning that they will likely stay Muslim, marry a Muslim and raise Muslim children. It's highly unusual for them to marry a non-Muslim, thus they remain more isolated and insular.

&gt;I don't have a specific problem with Muslims, but you'll find that many of the right wing votes are from people who are worried about the pace of change and not actually the presence of any Muslims at all. Some areas of the country are now Muslim dominated where they weren't 10 years ago. Is it really surprising that people who live in those areas are freaked out, feel overrun and want to vote UKIP or similar? You have to realise that not everybody is young and went to Uni and has lots of friends from all over the world. If you're an older person, all you see is shop front with weird writing on them, people wearing funny clothes in the street and your GP surgery waiting room filled with brown people. And you perceive all of that negatively.

&gt;And let's also be honest about something. From our more liberal-left point of view, Islam doesn't really play nicely with many of the things we hold dear in the UK. It is still a religion which does not value equality between men and women, one that does not respect homosexuals, and one that remains very isolated from the rest of the population - forbidding marriage between Muslims and non-Muslims, forbidding them to eat at &gt;90% of British restaurants which aren't halal. Stricter adherents will not even let un-married males go into their houses (i.e. at school I had a Pakistani friend but I could never visit his house because he had a sister and it would be a sin for me to see her because I was a guy (and non-Muslim too, making it even worse!)). It's a very isolationist religion overall which doesn't lend well to all the ""multiculturalism"" and ""integration"" we hear about.

&gt;Polish people also got a lot of criticism when they came over here in large numbers, but people are gradually coming to accept them. There are many reasons for that, but mainly because they have fit in really well. Many have made a life here, they've spread and diluted everywhere across the country and not just a few communities, they do many different jobs at different skill levels, they date and marry Brits and have children together, plus they can participate in our social activities too.

So, in summary - we need to evaluate the level of immigration. We also need to evaluate WHERE those people go. Crowding all Muslims into a handful of postcodes is not a good idea. Their population isn't that large (right now), but they are very densely present in certain areas. We also need to be serious about integration, and if we are doing to TALK about integration and multiculturalism, we need to actually DO it. Islam is by its nature an isolationist religion, so Muslims need to be prepared to open up and fit into British society. (In fact, one rule in the Koran says that 'when in Rome, do as Romans do"".) And we need to be accepting of some differences and welcome them. But at the same time, we shouldn't HAVE to tolerate things like segregation of men and women, the way that many Muslim families prevent their daughters from going to Uni, their views on homosexuality, the forced marriages and the takeover of local schools. We should be able to say ""hang on a second, this is not acceptable in British society"". We shouldn't have to cower for fear of being called a racist BNP nut job or labelled as somebody backwards and intolerant.

One problem is the religious aspects. Many of the immigrant religions are isolationist and intolerant themselves. Islam, and certainly most Pakistani/Bangladeshi families, forbid marriage of Muslims and non-Muslims, so they will pretty much never date a non-Muslim. Also consider that they can't eat at &gt;90% of British restaurants because the food isn't halal. Nor do they drink alcohol, a major British pastime and social activity. They don't have pre-marital sex either. My Pakistani friend has two kids under the age of 5 and he was telling them about how white people believe in Christmas but they don't celebrate it because they are different. Of course I'm not saying (before someone twists my words) that you have to drink, have premarital sex or celebrate christmas to be accepted in the UK, but all of those things add up to the us vs them mentality and voluntary segregation which you mentioned. And again, let's be totally honest here - we all know that Muslims treat non-Muslims differently. If it's a business deal, the other guy from the same background as you (who you might call uncle or brother) gets preferential treatment. Anybody who hasn't seen this to some extent doesn't really know many British Muslims. And to be honest, I do understand that behaviour. If I was in Asia, I'd feel more comfortable dealing with another Brit - but that's not a healthy ""multicultural"" attitude is it.

Polish people have been generally accepted now. There are many reasons why - they don't dress differently, so they are more approachable. They don't have customs and traditions we don't understand. They eat the same food as us, they speak our language well, they drink beer and watch football. And also, their men and women are good looking and are happy and willing to talk to you, date you, marry you and have kids with you. Same for French, Germans and many other countries. But some immigrants don't do those things, and don't WANT to really fit into the UK. They want to enjoy the benefits of this country such as the money making, safety, freedom, lack of corruption etc - but they want to keep their own ways, many of which are incompatible with the UK in 2014. I totally support tolerance, and I don't care whether people want to wear orange saris, put a dot on their head, pray to the east, not eat pork or do whatever. But the voluntary segregation into a few postcode, the attitudes to women and homosexuals, take-over plots of schools and many other religious/cultural aspects are not great - and we shouldn't be forced to pretend they are acceptable.

true,botttled_water,null,null,"I am rather center but i think europe as an entity has become self defeatingly progressive. I'm not talking about gay marriage or anything, I see those things as being part of our inheritance, but for example, there is a belief in europe that other cultures have precedence over our own, and that it is racist to be against immigration or suggest that certain people should not be allowed into europe. 

Since this has entered the mainstream thought, many people who were right wing anyway have become disillusioned and turned towards parties like UKIP because there isn't much else out there. If you vote BNP you're labelled a racist too. The thing is, 100 years ago, the views of BNP regarding Britain being for the British was mainstream, with countries based on ethnicity. Within a generation that has all changed and the government has tried to step up the rhetoric that multiculturalism is good. The reason why it's good is because if we didn't have it our economy would most certainly be under threat, as our population is no longer growing naturally. 

Turning from a country based on ethnicity to one based on what is seemingly nothing, since anyone can be british if they just say 'im british', has made a lot of people angry. It's no wonder we're seeing the rise of fascism again. People are intrinsically racist and want to protect their own values and people. At least, that's what we call racist today. It doesn't mean 'I'm better cause I'm white', it means 'I think England is an English country based off ethnicity, and so I disagree with mass immigration on cultural grounds'. 

I guess it comes down to what you think Britain will be in 100 years. If we continue how we are, Britain will just be a country of countries, and British people, excluding a white baby boom, will probably be a minority (especially in the younger age groups). If British children are a minority within 100 years, it will be too quick to integrate all the new immigrants. Alternatively, you believe in a more geopolitical, ethnic based country identity, or at least just european country.

true,ButterflyAttack,null,null,"You and a group of friends set up a  cooperative - legally, it's fairly similar to a limited company, as I understand it. You then raise a deposit, and as much of the purchase price as you can. You do this either by your own contributions, or by selling loan stock.  
Loan stock is like shares in the cooperative. You approach friends, family, colleagues, whatever, and they buy stock which normally repays after a fixed term - ten or twenty years is normal. It's adjusted for inflation, and they can choose whether they want interest on the sum or not. Some people waive the interest to support what you're doing, others don't.

You can then approach an organisation called radical routes, who are a sorta hippy lender. They may also help you with funding. You then apply for your mortgage. Many people use Triados, as we planned to. 

So, the cooperative buys the property, and you all own the cooperative. You all pay rent to the co-op, which in turn pays the mortgage and builds funds to repay loanstock and carry out any work on the property. 

I don't know if it still happens, but I've heard of coops getting very long term mortgages, with the intention of keeping their repayments low. It's not so much about equity as about having somewhere cheap and pleasant to live, where you have security, you won't be kicked out by a landlord. 

That's what I'm looking for, really - a house I can work on, and some land where I can put up a couple of polytunnels, grow organic veg, plant some fruit trees. 

We went through the process of setting up the co-op, but it took us a couple of years. There are 8 of us, and by the time we were ready to start raising funds, people had started having babies, college, whatever. So it's on a back burner for now, but I'm hoping we'll get there eventually. 

These days, the property market is getting medieval - the wealthy own it, and the poor are tenants, at the mercy of the rich, and their rights and protections are inadequate and rarely enforced. It's hard to find any sort of quality of life or security for old age without either becoming part of that system of greed or becoming victim to it. But we're trying.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"I think a lot of this comes down to education, and schools. If all of your formal education is in an establishment where everyone is the same religion (which is often linked to race) then it is establishing a culture of not interacting with anyone outside your community. Further, if teachers and parents are teaching eg. homosexuality is sinful, abortion is murder, the world is 6,000 years old, the Jews are evil etc there is no other narrative. It then seems normal to not have friends, relationships or do business with people outside the community.

Also, I think part of the issue is that people like Abu Hamza and Anjem Choudary are the public 'face' of Middle Eastern immigration / Muslims in the UK (though Choudary was born here). They are actually not particularly popular with most Muslims living in the UK, but since they are good at stirring up anger and spouting controversial anti-West rhetoric they get attention. There are plenty of White British people who talk rubbish and have odd ideas about society, but they are never viewed as representative of White Britons. The Britain First group seems to exemplify this, they have a huge hatred / fear of Muslim radicals, not realising that the idea that Britain will become a Muslim country under Sharia law is just laugahbly absurd. Only about 5% of the UK is Muslim, and most of them aren't trying to usher in a Muslim revolution. And yet they genuinely seem to fear this. Again, I think they are fooled by thinking that the guy shouting loudest must be representative of the majority. Perhaps there needs to be less attention on a small minority of radicals, and more on popular / successful immigrants like Mo Farah.

How can this nationalist simultaneously accept Poland holding half of Ostpreussen and the superiority of the German people? They are mutually incompatible. Such a nationalist must want reunification with lost lands. Must want unification with Austria which only didn't happen to begin with because of idiotic royals putting their own prestige above the German people. This person must want German ownership of Elsass-Lothringen and the Sudetenlands. It is not possible for a person who believes in German superiority and the primacy of the German national state to believe otherwise.
