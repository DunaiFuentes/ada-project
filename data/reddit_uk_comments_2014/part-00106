In a modern day context, I point you towards the Ukraine crisis. Russia has walked into Crimea uncontested and annexed the entire region, while harassing the new border. Now lets imagine Argentina tried to do that to the Falklands, it wouldn't happen, they'd be crushed. When you grow up in an almost golden age of peace, it's easy to see war as a fairy tale, something that couldn't possibly effect you. People in the 1930's certainly never imagined World War 2 was only a few years away, and look at the extreme disadvantage Britain was placed under due to a lack of military spending.

We are a permanent member of the UN Security council and have a special membership in the EU, we can directly influence the entire worlds politics, and why? Because we have long range nuclear capabilities and a large, powerful armed forces.

With all that said, do you think it's reasonable to be decommissioning planes, reducing money spent per soldier and putting less investment into future military technology?

As I said, there's another explanation. I would literally rather believe that he's the same as everyone else - prone to prejudice and dehumanization, as everyone is.

Are you really going to tell me that those who are relatively wealthy and in authority aren't prone to dehumanizing the poor? That taking away legal aid wasn't obviously intended to reserve legal protection for the relatively wealthy? That those politicians didn't believe that they would never be accused of a crime they didn't commit?

Remember - it's also recognised in social psychology that pretty much all of us automatically assume that if anything bad happens to someone, they must have somehow deserved it - [victim blame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming). Also, whatever we do, we don't deserve those bad things ourselves of course. After all, by the [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), I do what I do because of the situation I'm stuck in, but you do what you do because you're a bad person - we're (almost) all hypocrites. In terms of the FAE, though, it turns out that the clinically depressed are generally the opposite - assuming that they themselves are bad people while everyone else does what they do due to circumstances. It's obviously easy to blame people who blame themselves anyway.

&gt; a different philosophy that challenges lots of peoples ideas of what is fair

And apparently you'd also have me believe that when people suffer and die from disability and other circumstances they can't control, and from lack of support that they need, that's not unfair - it's just ""challenging peoples ideas of what is fair"". Sounds like weasel words to me.

The problem is that most phones fall into flagship-tier or shit-tier. There are few phones in between, and most of the ones that are tend to just be the flagship phones from a few years ago.

Protip: Don't buy a new Galaxy phone. For their flagship (S1-4) line you're probably better off getting a Nexus 5.

Revision doesn't mean just writing things out endlessly - try drawing silly cartoons of what you're learning or make up poems or mnemonics or songs about them to help you remember and sing them to yourself. Record things to CD and listen back to them when you're doing chores or generally pottering about. The more bizarre and fun your method of learning is, the more likely you are to remember it. Derren Brown in particular has great memory methods for learning lots of information.

Keep your goal in mind - put a picture of the sixth form or your ideal university up in your room and remind yourself that those are what you're aiming for. It's short term graft for long term goals. You'll thank yourself in sixth months time for putting your head down now and just getting it done.

Too early to discount my opinion. I've been a school governor and you'd get formal complaints about the damnedest things. I presume that a single complained about a school would enough to spark a formal investigation, in these circumstances.

Notably the quote from the the council leader: ""No, I don't believe there is a plot, but there are issues we need to look at and look at very carefully - issues perhaps around how a governing body behaves, perhaps what is said and done around the school.""

Is quite a forthright one from a man who has presumably been briefed on the nature of the 2500 complaints. He's unlikely to want to make himself look daft if an enquiry was about to announce: ""It's a plot!"".

true,sovietuk,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I can't help feel that the HS2 plans are attacking the problem in the wrong order tho - i've just returned from travelling around japan, yes, the high speed trains are very nice, but fundamentally their transport links feeding around the hi-speed stations are exceptionally good - they're part of the main city train stations, with excellent subway connections all around their cities - its very easy to leave your house/hotel, get the subway into the central station and hop straight onto the shinkansen, and all the local transport is so regular and prompt i know how long to leave to get to the station on time.

Compare that with here - i live on the outskirts of leeds, about 10 mins motorway drive with no traffic. I could :-
a) walk 20 minutes to my nearest local train station, of which as i'm the last station before leeds i'm lucky i can get on the train let alone a seat as there aren't enough carriages. HS2 wont give me more carriages on local trains. Once i get into town i'll then need to leave the station to walk the 15 minutes to the proposed location of the HS2 terminal (and thank my lucky stars i'm not living in sheffield, where the terminal is several miles out of town, or that i'm not travelling from newcastle where i'll need to change trains at leeds and do the 15 min walk as part of my journey).

b) drive into town - i'll need to leave plenty of time to account for the fact that the m621 into the centre grinds to a halt as soon as someone breaks down anywhere in rush hour(s), making journey times extremely variable and unpredictable - can easily take me an hour on a bad day. I'll then need to try to find somewhere to park - it'll probably end up being a fair walk from the station.

Either way, my long-haul journey time to london currently isn't the problem - its the local connection journey that takes up my time and saps my will to live, all thanks to under-funded/uninspired local transport - i'd much rather *that* was sorted as thats all wasted economically-dead time, compared to productive time on an eastcoast train using a laptop and wifi).",0,1397513746,null,0,false,0,cgsh400,t3_230cds,t1_cgsh400,t1_cgs9vti,null,1433355715,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

To the centre, you name 2 parties who are not designate themselves as unionist. Basically absurd that you mention them since any 'converts to unionism' will by definition be voting for unionist parties.

The UUP have already demonstrated they lack the political energy to adjust to the necessary quick thinking and subtleties of modern politics. As for their 'historical sectarian baggage' - hasn't held back the likes of SF have they? NI21 are still showing naivety and idealism in place of the political wit and agility necessary for a new party.

The Conservatives may have been well placed to grow unionism if the pact with the UUP had faired better. As it is, they are small like NI21 and will likely steal votes off eachother. 

You've basically just made a thinly veiled attack against all unionist parties instead of tackling my actual point - the DUP, if they chose to do so, are in the strongest position of the unionist parties to deliver on the policy direction their leader hints towards.

You'll need an [okpay](http://www.okpay.com) account to get money into the exchange.. to withdraw, btc-e does support direct GBP bank withdrawals straight into your bank account. Once you have the okpay account, you can also use it with [ibwt](http://www.ibwt.co.uk) as well without any additional verification. Ibwt is a UK exchange that has a GBP market and also supports okpay.

Okpay works with some other exchanges such as [crypto-trade](https://crypto-trade.com/fees) and [the rock](https://www.therocktrading.com/en/pages/fees)

and probably others.. but I'm not aware of any others (than btc-e and ibwt) that support okpay and also have a GBP denominated market. MTGOX used to support okpay and had a GBP market, but who knows if they will ever reopen for business.

To get money into okpay it still involves a SWIFT bank transfer (probably around ¬£10 fixed fee but some banks charge more) to the Czech republic (where okpay's accounts are held), but at least there won't be any foreign exchange fees because you are dealing only in GBP.

You can also SWIFT wire GBP to bitstamp (they will convert it to USD automatically) to deposit.. this is generally cheaper than using SEPA EUR transfers and probably costs about the same as using okpay (either way you initiate a SWIFT GBP wire transfer so the bank fees on your end will be identical). Unfortunately there is no way to get bitstamp to initiate a GBP withdrawal so you'll always end up paying your bank's FX rate (typically 2.5%) to receive withdrawals and convert EUR to GBP. I think this would also work with [kraken](http://www.kraken.com), but I haven't tried it.

Let's not forget [localbitcoins](http://www.localbitcoins.com) and [bitbargain](http://www.bitbargain.co.uk) which actually have a fair amount of volume. These are person to person direct bank transfer trading sites and they are the only option for buying using regular uk bank transfers but the sellers tend to charge a premium for their manual service.. on bitbargain at the moment the cheapest offer is around 8% over the prices on bitstamp or btc-e. Not the best price, but you'll have BTC in your wallet in under 10min usually and no messing around with foreign bank transfers and associated fees.

Another option is these guys;

https://www.velaexchange.co.uk/buy.htm

They sell BTC via UK bank transfer directly and also will fund egopay via UK bank transfer so you can deposit to btc-e or bitfinex or any other exchange that supports egopay or any payment system connected to egopay (which is pretty much everything because egopay will let anyone use their payment system).

 Nigel Farage faces an expenses investigation into almost ¬£60,000 of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù European Union funds paid into his personal bank account.

The Ukip leader has received ¬£15,500 a year from the EU since at least 2009 to pay for the upkeep of his constituency office, a small converted grain store near Bognor Regis, according to transparency reports filed on the party‚Äôs website.

However, the grain store was given rent-free to Mr Farage by Ukip supporters 15 years ago. Utilities and other non-rental costs amount to no more than ¬£3,000 a year, according to the former office manager, leaving about ¬£12,000 a year unexplained.

The Ukip leader, who has made strides in the polls after condemning the former culture secretary Maria Miller‚Äôs expenses abuse last week, confirmed that he received his office rent free but insisted that he legitimately spent more than ¬£1,000 a month to run the 620 sq ft property.

A former senior Ukip official has filed a formal complaint about Mr Farage to the EU anti-fraud office OLAF. The complainant wishes to remain anonymous because of ‚Äúphysical threats‚Äù allegedly made by other Ukip officials against members who raised questions about the party‚Äôs finances.

Ukip MEPs have only filed transparency reports since July 2009, meaning that it is possible Mr Farage spent more than ¬£200,000 of EU funds on ‚Äúoffice management and running‚Äù costs on his office since his election in 1999.

Under EU and Ukip guidelines, such spending is limited to rent, water, electricity, heating, insurance and business rates. Stationery, office equipment, staff and communications come under separate spending categories.

Like all MEPs, Mr Farage receives a general expenditure allowance (GEA) of about ¬£3,800 a month to rent and run an office in his home country. No MEP is required to file receipts to show how this money is spent, however, opening the system up to potential abuse.

‚ÄúYou shove it down your trousers if you want to,‚Äù Mike Nattrass, a former Ukip MEP, said. ‚ÄúThe EU will never ask them to justify it. That‚Äôs the trouble with it. It goes into your bank account whether you want it or not.‚Äù

Mr Farage accepted that MEPs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need any receipts or any justification‚Äù to receive EU allowances. He said that he used his GEA to run the grain store as well as a smaller office located at his home.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt pay rent on the office but I obviously pay for everything else,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs the burglar alarm or electricity.‚Äù

Mr Farage disputed a statement by David Samuel-Camps, the grain store‚Äôs office manager in 2010, who said that running costs amounted to only ¬£3,000 a year.

‚ÄúAbout ¬£1,000 a month is roughly what it is,‚Äù the Ukip leader said. ‚ÄúExceptionally I put more money in as and when it‚Äôs needed.‚Äù

Mr Farage also revealed that he used a proportion of his GEA to pay more than ¬£1,000 a month towards a controversial second EU pension scheme of which he was a member between 1999 and 2009.

Under the generous scheme, which was criticised by many MEPs at the time, members paid in ¬£1,052 from their own money every month which was supplemented by a generous taxpayer-funded payment of ¬£2,104.

Like other MEPs, Mr Farage‚Äôs contribution to the pension was deducted from his GEA before the rest was deposited into his bank account.

The system relied on MEPs being honest enough to fund the shortfall in GEA out of their own cash. Mr Farage insists he did so.

Last year the Ukip leader was embarrassed after it was revealed he had set up the Farage Family Educational Trust on the Isle of Man in order to mitigate tax, although he said that he did not personally benefit.

Mr Farage was last night forced to deny claims made by former staff members that he transferred European funds into other offshore bank accounts he controlled which were located in the Cayman Islands and the Isle of Man.

Mr Farage said that any inquiries into such matters were ‚Äúcompletely, wholly unacceptable‚Äù and added that he would not answer ‚Äúany more questions of that nature‚Äù.

An EU spokeswoman confirmed: ‚ÄúIt is on the MEP‚Äôs honour that the assumption is made that the money is spent properly.‚Äù

A Ukip spokesman said: ‚ÄúNigel Farage is confident that he has abided by European parliamentary rules at all times when spending allowances.‚Äù ",0,1397516644,null,0,false,0,cgsihbq,t3_231cfv,t1_cgsihbq,t3_231cfv,null,1433356361,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; So I'm 16, about to start my main GCSE exams next month. All the usual pressure and all that is on. We're told at school, and by pretty much any other adult, that to not revise, and subsequently fail your GCSEs is the worst thing that can ever happen to you in life.

Its partly bollocks. 

My wife left school at 15 with no qualifications. She went to college and did hairdressing for a couple of years. She then managed to get a chance to do some work at a sign company for a couple of weeks picking the middles out of vinyl letters. She impressed the owners that much that they took her on. She now manages the sign company and does everything in it from sales to design work to manufacturing and fitting. 

My best friend left school with no qualifications. He's illiterate and innumerate but extremely good with his hands and has a very good mechanical aptitude. He has a shop where he repairs laptops including repairing the motherboards to component level, something which many people who've gone to college would struggle with and he's entirely self taught. 

I left school with good O level results. Other than getting me into college to do a BTEC level 3 which in turn allowed me to go to university many years later they've served absolutely no use at all in my life. My son left school a couple of years ago with crap GCSE results. It hasn't prevented him doing what he wants and he's just about to finish a college course doing what he wanted to do at the college he wanted to do it. Once he's finished the BTEC he's done and the job history he has, as he's worked as well as going to college, will be more important than his GCSE grades to employers.

Maths and English and ideally a science will see things be a bit easier early in life but once you exit your teens they become pretty superfluous for gaining employment as experience overrules qualifications and experience in a particular type of job will be looked at far more than what GCSEs you have.",0,1397517608,null,0,1397517924,0,cgsix95,t3_230h1w,t1_cgsix95,t3_230h1w,null,1433356571,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,AimHere,null,null,"&gt;On the 'loyalist fringes', simultaneously raising each of those parties as a threat and then dismissing them in the same breath tells you all you need to know about the danger posed.

If that's the case, how come they patently aren't moving in a more conciliatory direction, excepting perhaps yesterday's small burst of rhetoric? Day in, day out, everything they say and do places them firmly and squarely in that sectarian unionist box. McGuinness meets the queen to the dismay of dissident republicans, while the Belfast DUP abstains from the papal visit vote. Instead of bringing along two politicians to Haass like everyone else, Robinson pulls along an Orange Lodge leader and they get themselves maneouvred into looking like rejectionists (rightly or wrongly). 

The DUP might not be scared of the specific parties I mentioned, but they're most definitely scared of *something* lurking in the loyalist fringes. And as I pointed out earlier, Ian Paisley and the DUP was once that very lurking something, back in the day. They know that game very well.

&gt;To the centre, you name 2 parties who are not designate themselves as unionist. Basically absurd that you mention them since any 'converts to unionism' will by definition be voting for unionist parties.

I don't care about semantics. What we're talking about is a hitherto nationalist voter for some reason deciding to cast his or her vote elsewhere, and I'd surmise that there'll be more overlap between potential Alliance voters and potential NI21 ones than there would be between, say, NI21 and DUP. If this hypothetical voter is thinking of voting across the community, that whole 'vote unionist/nationalist at all costs' thing has already broken down.

&gt;As for their 'historical sectarian baggage' - hasn't held back the likes of SF have they?

Oh of course it has. SF has *far* less chance of picking up unionist votes than the UUP has of garnering nationalist ones. Sinn Fein is now looking south for any electoral gains, because they know damn well that it's not going to get much better for them in Northern Ireland, barring perhaps medium-long term demographic changes.

&gt;You've basically just made a thinly veiled attack against all unionist parties

Not so thinly veiled. They're all terrible. The nationalist ones aren't much better, by the way, though Sinn Fein does show the odd glimmer of political competence and self-confidence now and again - they actually look and behave like a party willing to tell the hardliners to fuck off and bleed off a few votes here and there, if it makes them look magnanimous, statesmanlike or conciliatory.

&gt;instead of tackling my actual point

I did tackle it. The DUP is, or at least appears to be, unable to move from it's entrenched position, and any gains it would make from trying to woo nationalists would be nonexistent-to-minimal.

If they lose to City and Chelsea I don't think they will have high hopes and it is a good thing we play them last as the game could mean nothing to them if the next few weeks are bad for them.

**Cardiff** will probably only be able to beat Stoke and Sunderland but even that I don't think they will achieve, so they will likely be going back down. 

**Fulham** I can't see pulling much off against 3 decent teams and a Spurs team that really needs to win a few games to keep their top 4/5 hopes alive.

**Norwich** stand no chance (but I would like to be proven wrong). But, they could stay up due to the teams below them, but getting any points against those teams seems very unlikely, especially two teams fighting for title, and two teams fighting for top 4/5.

**West Brom** will probably be fine, they could get a point against 4 of the teams they have left.

**Swansea** I think are pretty much safe already, we have a better goal difference than every team below us and every team above us up until 8th. Probably will get at least 2 points at home and hopefully a win away at Sunderland which brings us up to 38 points which is over the 36 points I think we need. It has been a pretty bad season but really, considering the games we have had, it had been a very enjoyable season. I wish we could play in Europa League next year but I am very glad we aren't due to our squad size.

But no I provided information from the article which most people probably didn't read, probably not even the person I replied to, and only a short part of my comment was a short very soft opinion. 

People on here like to call UKIP supports ignorant, I've probably said something bad about them once, but downvoting and ignoring comments that don't go with your view of hating everything UKIP is so much more ignorant. This sub can be pretty disappointing with the whole needing the same general opinion thing.

It sounds like UKIP was given a budget(¬£15k/year), just like everybody else i guess, by the EU to rent an office and stuff, but they managed to get the office for rent free, so they're only using ¬£3k, but Nigel is still taking the rest of the money(¬£1k/month). So it doesn't really sound like ""missing"" money, i guess thats why it's put into quotes in the first place.

He seems to be pretty open about it so it doesn't really matter who wrote this, credentials doesn't really matter if the person you're talking about is saying the same thing. 

Nigel is saying that he still has to pay for everything else, he said he still has to pay for the bills and if a new alarm needs to be fitted he would have to pay(usually the office owner would), so it's not like he is taking the money and spending none on it's original intended usage.

I mean whether or not that's ok is debatable, i guess you could say he shouldn't be taking the money but then again if he has to buy an alarm or something for the office like he said he would have to pay for that and that's not cheap, so for all we know most COULD be going to the office, or it MIGHT in the future. It's intended usage includes ""rent, water, electricity, heating, insurance and business rates. Stationery, office equipment"", pretty specific and it does sound like it's made with the idea of renting in mind, but in UKIPs case it seems like they got the rent free but they have to pay for everything else, which isn't on the list but i think it's acceptable imo, IF they do use or save the money for those kind of things.

The headline seems to try making it sound worse than it actually is, especially by using the word ""stolen"", at first you think that well if he is taking that much money then he is a dick, but the article explains it more and doesn't make it sound so bad **IMO**

Walking down the wrong street wearing the wrong clothes can get you harassed and even beaten.

Theo van Gogh was murdered in the streets of Amsterdam for a film he made.

The BBC and Channel 4 have also had threats made against them for films about Islam. Salman Rushdie, Tommy Robinson and Douglas Murray have all had attempts on their lives too.

true,sappy16,null,null,"It depends how soon you are planning to use the money, and whether or not you will need to access it in the meantime. A bond will likely give you the best rate of interest. It is like a savings account, but you can't touch your money - or add to it in most cases, I believe - for a fixed period of time (usually 1, 3 or 5 years - the longer you sign up for, the better the interest rate you will be offered).

If this money is also your 'emergency fund', you will probably want to put it in a regular savings account. Some of these restrict the number of withdrawals you can make each year, in exchange for a better interest rate. You usually *can* make more withdrawals than the limit, but you will take a hit on your interest.

The government allows you to save a certain amount of money each year without having to pay income tax on any interest you make. It is supposed to encourage people to save. To take advantage of this, you will need to open an ISA (individual savings account). There are many different types, but pretty much all banks will offer them.

You can also open an investment account, where you allow the bank to invest the money in stocks/shares/funds on your behalf. These usually have the potential to yield higher returns than the interest they pay on a savings account, but there is also a risk that you will lose money.

It was a big game, an emotional day and he had a couple of legitimate penalty claims turned down. He got an unfortunate yellow right at the start of the match because he caught Demichelis with his trailing leg. Should never have been a yellow, I can understand why he got frustrated. At the end of the day, look at his celebrations for our goals...he's happy and he was celebrating as much as anyone when Sterling, Skrtel and Coutinho scored. He's happy the team's winning, but he's super competitive and puts a *lot* of pressure on himself too.

Yeah, he didn't play great yesterday but this isn't cause for concern. He's not going through a crisis or anything. He just didn't get the rub of the green yesterday...didn't get as much time on the ball as he's used to and he spent 95% of the match having to deal with the danger of a second yellow hanging over his head. Just because he didn't look or act happy for the whole match doesn't mean anything's wrong.

&gt;There's never been a successful multiracial society, anywhere. As the failure of this latest experiment becomes ever more apparent the Left will, as always, blame the locals for the failed result of something they never asked for.

&gt;Ghettos, race riots and high immigrant crime will ensue and the leftist media will respond by blaming the Irish people for it. The Left will act by flooding Ireland with even more immigrants to outnumber the locals at election time, and will fill Irish children's brains with a self-loathing ideology so that they actually celebrate the downfall of their own people.

&gt;Rejecting our colonization by Africans and Asians is not racism, there is no reason at all why our population should suffer it in silence.

&gt;This colonization is driven by a greedy international elite who wish to create a new serf class.

&gt;Emma West is no different to Gandhi or Mandela.

It's just that over time, a lot of stock ended up in places it wasn't supposed to be, and just repeatedly tidied up as opposed to going back to its place. Storage places for stock that wasn't shelved were totally out of order. I didn't tear out the whole shop and re-do it my way. I just scoured through everything and re-set it to how it probably looked when they first opened, years ago. And then alphabetised all the stored stock to make it far more accessible.

As for 'training the managers' at M&amp;S.. there was no excuse, really. I had pointed out that the stock rotation in certain parts of the store was quite lacking. They told me how to rotate it properly, although they only actually told me the short version, how to rotate it properly if it's being continually and diligently rotated. I had found that it hadn't, so I took it upon myself to give a brief walkthrough. I was only there for a week, and was rather tired of getting the ELI5 treatment that you'd give someone who's never worked in retail before, especially after the amount of retail jobs I've had. I knew it all anyway, and knew the in-depth methods that most places avoid in favour of speed. Still, I didn't have a job to lose, so I took the opportunity to display my prior knowledge, because I figured it would be rude to just say 'I know all this, go away'.

If you want my advice i'd go for call centre work. You have customer service experience, are good with computers and seem to work well in a team. 

Stop with all the overanalysing shit, strategy assets etc. Just focus on your positives - even lie about your character. Smart, confident, efficient, hard worker, team player - just tick the boxes stop trying to portray some epic life story.

You're going for low skilled low paid work not running for PM.

If you want to call on experience for an interview use those examples, but don't tell them the negatives only focus on the positives.

Call centre work can be a lot of fun, targets are motivating, commission can be good, friends can be made. 

Just grind it out saving up money to do a course of your choice- preferably something lower skill leveled than programming. 

If you have the money just do that now.

Why should the board come out and back Lambert at this stage? In many other clubs, Lambert would have been toast (quite rightly).

When I see fellow supporters criticise our owner and board I cringe - I really do - because we have one of the best hierarchies in the Premier League. Our chairman continually backs his managers with cash even after having been majorly shafted by MON and the signings we've made have all more or less been pretty shocking.

The one accusation that you can justifiably level at the board is perhaps their naivety at times - but if that's as bad as it gets, I'm really actually quite happy with the set up.

We just need someone (Kevin MacDonald for example) to come in, bleed in the YTS, and not be afraid of playing some fucking football (whatever division we belong in).

Lerner has been to how many games this season? Please enlighten everyone, as you obviously have facts that no one else does. He has barely stepped foot in the country his business is in, let alone watched a game.
Im sure thats called an arm chair fan? 

As for lambert, he has had a below par wage bill and in my eyes is finishing off a job mcleish was clearly hired to do (that almost backfired).
There has been major rumours, multiple times might i add (some with more proof than others), that lambert has attempted to sign some big names, but failed once getting to the board room. Players like lukaku, barry, zaha, just imagine for one second having lukaku and benteke up front? Do you really think we would be in a relegation battle. Not a chance.

There is clearly major problems down at the club, and although i think lambert has an awful way with words, especially about the fans to the press, he is by far no worse than any other manager we could afford. What manager could you name that could and WOULD come in tomorrow and do a better job. 
Let me also remind you that MON was given freedom by the board, Houllier was brought in by that same board, even with health problems, and that led onto the worse managerial signing in the world. So for arguments sake, that same board then brought in lambert, that in your eyes isnt fit for the job. So who really is blame?

true,[deleted],null,null,"If you can only see negatives in Villa being relegated then you're either deluding yourself or you only care about the top flight of British football. Trust me, relegation isn't the end of the world, especially for a club like Villa who are properly run and have a fantastic infrastructure.

I agree that Lambert's mandate was to finish off McLeish's mandate. So what is the difference between the two? Not much, except Lambert has managed to put much more of a stamp on this team in terms of player recruitment, including some costly mistakes (e.g. buying two left backs who were never going to be as good as the shit that warnock was, or buying Bacuna to fill in everywhere other than his natural position, or a bunch of strikers who are never going to get a game whilst Benteke is still around - I could go on). I think that's forgivable though. 

The issue most fans have is the total and utter tactical incompetence. Villa get away with playing like this in the Premier League because most teams are better than us, so will attack us. In the Championship? We'd have to actually play some football because we'd have 23 teams parking the bus against us.

You have to be realistic. We've been one of the top spenders in the last five years and it didn't pay off at all. Luckily, our Owner decided on a change of tack before we did a Leeds or Portsmouth and not only is he forgoing some of the loans he made, but he's also making us sustainable. You can see from Arsenal's example that self-sustenance can work and I would much rather this than another reckless billionaire swoop in and swoop out.

As for your question ""What manager could you name that could and WOULD come in tomorrow and do a better job""? I already mentioned Kevin Macdonald. To be honest, I would be happy (and I suspect most Villa fans would feel the same) for ANY manager who would bleed in our fantastic YTS instead of letting them rot away in the reserves. MON, GH, AM and PL have all largely ignored our youth team and that's unfrogivable, especially the mandates which they were set with.

After MON shafted us, I can completely understand the board's reluctance to give completely free reign to their manager. It is popular to bash Houllier but he didn't do too badly at all actually. AM being appointed was inexplicable though, and I can only guess that he was the only manager in the league willing to accept the conditions the board imposed on him.

It comes down to this: the board's vision is having a self-sustaining Villa. This means (probably) never competing at the highest level (unless we get lucky and have a golden generation YTS) but it does mean stability and integrity in the football league. 

And as for Lukaku and Benteke on the same team, I doubt any results would have differed this season. All we'd see is Guzan pumping half his balls to Benteke's face, and half to Lukaku's face.",0,1397543542,null,0,false,0,cgstmp2,t3_22zywt,t1_cgstmp2,t1_cgst1l8,null,1433361709,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

By pure coincidence, Caan's Emergency Temporal Shift sent him directly into the Time War, an event that had been timelocked. A timelocked event is guarded by all the forces of time for nothing to ever, ever get in. Breaking the time lock, and therefore breaking the laws of time, was an explosive, cataclysmic event, and it resulted in Caan seeing the entire time vortex in one go. The time vortex is essentially time itself, or at least it weaves time together. (It is the ""tunnel"" the TARDIS travels through in the titles.) Seeing all of time and space through the vortex drove him mad, since all of time and space is infinite amounts of information. This event also accounts for him gaining the ability to ""tell the future"" - he saw it in the vortex.

You have a billionaire funneling money, turning a loss, in order to build up the club. Do you actually know how much Roman lost and why Chelsea are ""debt free""? 

I do not care about other sports. This is football. It has survived without any restrictions and it can survive without it. There are enough quality players in the world that no club can sign them all. First and foremost, players want to play. This should have been evident to you after Mata and KDB were shipped out.

Maybe you don't seem to understand this, but, FFP or not, clubs can and will be able to buy anyone they want. 

As far as your link in the bottom. That is old news. There is absolutely nothing new in there. The list of sanctions are taken straight from the UEFA FFP website. What will they do? Fine a club with an endless supply of money? At worse, they will have a ban with their transfer window. And that is doubtful that will even hold up. Chelsea faced a similar ban with Kakuta and that was lifted.

It's got potentially high rewards and you don't pay tax on it BUT you might not get anything back or you could even lose money (unlikely). So this is a medium-risk option. 

2. Buy premium bonds. This is one of the only truly zero-risk options and so put in this a basic sum you couldn't bear to lose.

**David Lloyd George:** Did a good job of rebuilding the country after the First World War. Also spearheaded a lot of modern social reforms which are still used to this day, a real working mans politician.

**Magaret Thatcher:** Controversial politican, but you don't get elected three times without a lot of people liking you so here she is. Liberated the Falklands. Restored Britain as an Economic power at a time when a gradual national decline was the best the country could hope for, also removed the stranglehold the Unions had on the country, winter of discontent, three day week etc.

MEPs are given A FIXED EXPENSES AMOUNT. They are given ¬£15,500 to run an office regardless of how much it costs to run it.

Property investors usually have certain Agents they deal with. 


Their commission selling a property for ¬£300k let's say is ¬£10k. Their commission for selling it for ¬£320k is only ¬£11k.


Developers / investors will just say, get me the property for 300k and I'll pay you ¬£3-5k. It's a win-win situation. 


Agent then goes and tells the seller they got them their asking price of ¬£300k. But only got one serious offer. Seller doesn't know any better and is happy too. 


It works really well in a booming market with no auctions. Because the seller just has to believe what the agent tells them. 


If you think this is an isolated incident, you'd be naive. It's widespread and there are many many agents who do it and there's no legal ramifications at all (impossible to prove and they usually deal with repeat investors).

true,palehorse864,null,null,"Moffat wanted to get that one out of the way. We know the War Doctor counted because he was a new face/new body/new regeneration, so that brought us from Doctor 11 in the regeneration cycle (13 was the limit, 12 regenerations, 13 doctors, counting the first.) However, to dispense with the question, Moffat said that Tennant's hand regeneration counted too.

Ok, so here's how it went.
The audience believed: Matt Smith is the 11th doctor in the cycle, meaning there are two more Doctors to go. Capaldi can regenerate into the next guy just fine, but that guy has to worry about having no more regenerations since he is 13.

Moffat revealed new information: We saw John Hurt as a doctor in-between Mcgann (8) and Eccleston (9), so we, the audience, realized that The Doctor is actually going to be out of regenerations once he became Capaldi. Hopefully, we wouldn't have to worry about that for a few years, as long as Capaldi enjoyed the role and stayed in it.

Moffat drops a bomb: Oh, By the way, that regeneration Tennant did where he siphoned off energy to his hand to remain the same? That counted too. 

Now, Matt Smith is the last possible Doctor in the regeneration cycle. Capaldi is already cast though, but there are no more regenerations. So, at the end of the latest special, the Doctor was dying of old age, and he had no more regenerations to use to recover. 

However, Clara convinces the Time Lords to save the Doctor, and so they give him a whole new regeneration cycle. Now, we don't have to worry about it for another 12 regeneration cycles. Assuming the show continues, and each actor stays in for a brief period of two years (they usually stay longer, save for McGann and Eccleston), we don't have to fret about it for 24 years. 

I think Moffat did this because he wanted to secure the future of the show while he was still in the showrunner chair. If he left before Capaldi's tenure was over, he couldn't be sure what the next guy might do. Some misguided person might kill off the Doctor and try to introduce a new character to take his place. Now, the Doctor is likely secure for another 12 regenerations if the show lasts that long (I hope it will).

You've got about six weeks now to get ready and in all honesty you could start a new GCSE now and still get a C if you made it your priority. So with that in mind you need to make revising your priority. 

If you Google the name of the exam boards for your exams then you can access past papers for each of your subjects. What's brilliant about GCSE is that they ask very similar questions each year or at least the questions are in the same ball park. Spend the next week doing a few exam papers and then here's the important part: MARK THEM. Nothing will help you better than first of all seeing exactly where the marks come from in each question and secondly seeing where you are losing marks. This will be your guide for what to revise. Spend the next six weeks revising the areas you struggle in. Revising the ones you know won't help you at this point. 

After that take time to reread your novels, plays, poems and text books. Speak to your teachers about where you're struggling. We love enthusiastic students. I will bend over backwards for a student who cares. Ask them to go through your past papers with you if you don't understand where you lost marks. 

Draw up a revision timetable. Nothing more than half an hour at a time unless you're doing an exam. After half hour you're not paying attention so there's little point. ",0,1397559441,null,0,false,0,cgswghk,t3_230h1w,t1_cgswghk,t3_230h1w,null,1433363109,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Now you're just stealing my lines.

&gt; You are whining about city circumventing the FFP in order to build up their squad. And I am saying, I do not care at all.

Then how about... Don't reply to my post with an irrelevant subject?

&gt; For the simple reason that at it's core, Chelsea was built the same way. 

Do you not understand that this has absolutely nothing to do with the FFP? Do you also not understand that I am not talking about how both clubs came into superpower status? Or are you just being as resilient as ever in portraying your daftness?

&gt;You have a billionaire funneling money, turning a loss, in order to build up the club. Do you actually know how much Roman lost and why Chelsea are ""debt free""?

Ugh. Yes, Roman was funnelling money, but it wasn't breaking any footballing laws. As for why we are debt free, you are thinking that we've used a subsidiary which Roman can use to launder money to so our books on record are clean when we spend large amounts of money. Its bullshit because there really is no evidence of that. As of this season, I'm pretty sure we are the only club that is completely debt free. And if you're thinking its come overnight... Its not. When Kenyon was in charge his aim was to break even by 2010. Its taken us 4 extra years to achieve it.

&gt; As far as your link in the bottom. That is old news. There is absolutely nothing new in there. The list of sanctions are taken straight from the UEFA FFP website. What will they do? Fine a club with an endless supply of money? At worse, they will have a ban with their transfer window. And that is doubtful that will even hold up. Chelsea faced a similar ban with Kakuta and that was lifted.

Its actually dated yesterday, so no, not old news. If anything, its stressing the point of previous reports as well as new ones. Kakuta case got overturned because there wasn't sufficient evidence in the matter. You are comparing apples to oranges again. Either way, if the FFP wasn't serious, most clubs wouldn't be as persistent with its laws.

&gt;Which goes back to my original statement. The day a club is actually punished (a real one), is the day I will actually believe FFP actually matters. City and PSG failing is nothing new, in fact, they probably expected to fail.

If Barcelona can get a 2 transfer window ban for breaking transfer rules, I don't see why clubs like City or PSG can't get a more severe ban for breaking FFP rules. ",0,1397561103,null,0,false,0,cgswrmq,t3_22xtyb,t1_cgswrmq,t1_cgsur9h,null,1433363253,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Hillsborough was just before I was born, though my Dad's best mate's brother was killed in the tragedy so I've always had fairly strong knowledge on the event itself and a lot of the justice stuff through family ties. That said, I never realised actually how big an impact The Sun actually had on public perception at the time.

I'd always had the impression that people didn't know what had happened, who was to blame, that football hooliganism was always a potential factor. Bullshit. They reiterated so many times on MOTD how there was no violence, that the police seemed to be at fault, that there was absolutely nothing other than concern and a desire to help the injured and dying by the Liverpool supporters there on that day. 

It completely opened my eyes to just how much almost all of the public misinformation, all the work and fighting that the JFT96 and Hillsborough Justice campains have had to do against a consensus that the fans were at fault, almost all of that stems from that one fucking sickening article run by The Sun. There was a lot of sympathy and support for the cause of the Liverpool supporters right after the event, and The Sun completely trashed a huge amount of that.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Yeah, the way funding for MEPs works is atrociously bad, and I say that as someone with an EU fair, but we're not going to get a big press out cry about it for two reasons.

1) Not enough people care or know about the European Parliament

2) Most people who already follow EU politics know that the system is atrocious, so no newspaper can write ""exclusive"" or anything on their issues.

The system is open to fraud and abuse, however I think that's not such a problem because they can and have been prosecuted for it which is a discouragement on them doing it further. 

The main problem is all the stuff MEPs do get, which is completely legal. For instance there's this one MEP from some country or other who drives to the Parliament every day, signs in, collects his several hundred euros for turning up and leaves again without doing any work (why MEPs need a hundreds of euros a day as an incentive to turn up and do their job when they already have a salary is a mystery to me). They also get some ridiculously nice company (mercedes, BMWs, where as the PM only gets to ride a Jag). 

I think MEPs get a deal which is disproportionately good to them and a waste of money. 

However, the amount of money lost to this is negligible and hardly noticeable and the vast majority of MEPs do not abuse the system. MEPs have a lot more respect in my eyes than MPs at Westminster do and this is reinforced by the fact most of them don't need to stuff their hand into the EU funds to make it worth their while, despite it being very easy for them to do so. I just wish it got reformed so that frauds wouldn't be so attracted to the job. ",0,1397563562,null,0,false,0,cgsxapg,t3_231cfv,t1_cgsxapg,t1_cgsv6ms,null,1433363503,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Anyone overhearing from a distance could be be forgiven for believing the teacher must have said this first.

I am not trying to convince you that it didn't happen, only that to jump on the hype bandwagon without further evidence is perhaps a little hasty.

Here's a perfectly reasonable story that meets with the case presented in news article perfectly but had a major plot twist. 

Pupil is reprimanded by teacher in school queue.

Pupil goes to the back of the queue and over lunch with her friends concocts this story.

Pupil tells father who reports incident to the anti-semitic watchdog folk.

Watchdog folk contact school and news paper for added effect.

School investigate and find 'witnesses'. Immediately contact legal advisors and the police.

Under further investigation police find one or more of the girls to be lying.

Girl making initial complaint is suspended from school.

Paper contacts school for statement. Not wishing to offend any of its wealthy customers school makes open statement stating an investigation was carried out and appropriate action was taken.

Father of girl, who initially is angry and tells the paper so, is furious at her when the truth gets out and refuses to make any  further comment.

Paper runs story.

There is far too little information in that news story to instantly hate someone for it.

HS2 replaces the express services, (virgin pendelinos and voyagers) at the same time allowing them to run faster more frequently this leaves paths free for extra semi fast (currently London Midland) and freight.

The GWML will be the next one to fill up so after hs2 running another line London reading with possible onward branches to bristol Cardiff and Plymouth is a logical next step.

Airports is even more compelling because having Heathrow, stanstead, Gatwick and Luton all duplicating eachother is madness.

At some point barclays told them not to use the account for bitcoin related payments, so they introduced a laughable tickbox that basically said 'I promise not to use this payment for bitcoins' when you deposited via that mechanism. Of course there's no way to enforce such a rule.. it would be easy to bounce the money out of okpay to egopay (or some other non-bitcoin financial service, or even a friend with another okpay account) and back and then spend it on bitcoin anyway. It was at this point that they issued the statement saying they dropped support for bitcoin exchanges, even although the ban was essentially compeltely ineffective. At some point barclays decided this wasn't good enough and closed their faster payments account. 

After that happened they started processing their GBP payments through their Czech bank account which isn't connected to faster payments and no restrictions about making bitcoin related payments.. in other words you should not blame okpay for what happened.. it was entirely out of their hands. I think it's safe to say that no bitcoin exchange is ever going to be allowed to process faster payments.. it's been tried many times and always the banks close it down.

---

&gt;As the governing body of [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) is responsible for maintaining and implementing the rules that determine whether an association football player is eligible to represent a particular country in officially recognised international [competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football#International_competitions) and [friendly matches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_match). In the 20th century, FIFA allowed a player to represent any national team, as long as the player held citizenship of that country. In 2004, in reaction to the growing trend towards naturalisation of foreign players in some countries, FIFA implemented a significant new ruling that requires a player to demonstrate a ""clear connection"" to any country they wish to represent. FIFA has used its authority to overturn results of competitive international matches that feature ineligible players.

If you damage someone's car then both parties can agree to have it dealt without outside of insurance companies - but the way to do this would be to get a quote and then decide if you still want to go ahead with that. If it turns out that it's too expensive then you can change your mind and go down the insurance company route.

If they just went ahead and got it fixed before even getting to this point then I'm pretty sure there's no requirement that you pay anything - however you are still technically liable for the damages at a fair and reasonable rate. So might be worth letting your insurance company know about this if the bill is too high... then it will be left to their assessors... and if the damage has already been fixed the insurance company might just tell them it's tough crap and then you're quite likely to be in the clear.

It's worth noting too though that sometimes a ""light scratch"" on a car can be more serious than it looks. The frame under the panels can be damaged as well as other non-obvious things.

But if they didn't document (with photos) the full extent of the damage and if the repair bill doesn't add up to that amount of damage too, I'd imagine they don't have much to stand on.

Please don't take my word for it or as legal advice though!

In regards to, I think, all of the money transfer methods you described it's not only possible but easy to get your bank/credit card company to reverse a payment.

The exchange loses money, the credit card processor/bank begins to view Bitcoin as a risk, cuts off the exchange and we're back to square one.

&gt; On the front page you quote me as stating that the costs were ¬£3000 per year. This is grossly incorrect.

OK, fair enough, the Times quoted the wrong figure. Farage didn't over claim by ¬£12,000. 

&gt; I told you several times that I eventually reduced the costs to ¬£700 per month.

¬£700 a month? Well, judging by my expert knowledge of the 12 times table I got from school, that makes ¬£8,400 a year. That's still ¬£6,600 under the ¬£15,000 claimed, about 44% not going towards what it should be.

&gt;  (which is not too far removed from Mr Farage‚Äôs ¬£1000 per month)

Well, I'm not sure what they taught David Samuel-Camps in school, but ¬£700 a month is quite far removed from ¬£1000 a month over an entire year, about ¬£3600.

---

I'm going to wait and see what the investigation claims, and hopefully we will have full, transparent figures of the costs. This letter hardly makes it a non-story.

true,samliffe,eng-yorkshire,Yorks,"As you've eluded to, it's down to management. When I started there were two people working 4 long banks of freezers and we had all our stock ready to go and a warehouser ready to deal with the delivery. We'd fire through so many cages and make it look spot on. So obviously as we were so good they decided to move one person away from the freezers for 4 days a week then moved the warehouser to other work. We had uni graduates in every Christmas and though they were nice they just got in the way as you're having to babysit them on every new isle they work on and for some reason they were on a different one each shift.

The night manager I worked under for my first year was excellent, he was a bit of a knob but that's what you need in that industry. He always rolled his sleeves up if he needed to and would help out if you needed it. He moved to a larger store for better pay and it all went to shit after that. A new GM came in along with a sub manager who I detested with a passion and went about cutting hours for everyone to save money. They'd work early some days and come round inspecting your work and pulling you to on side if they didn't like it. I eventually lost all interest in the job. I'm the same when I go in supermarkets now though, I find myself facing up and moving stock from the back whenever I pick anything out. I even arrange the fucking trollies in the car park I can't help myself, drives me round the twist the way some folk leave trollies dotted about. 

I ain't blowing my own trumpet but I worked damn hard in that shop to get as much done as possible. I even traveled an hour to work each way. A few month before finishing I hurt my foot at work so was off a lot as I couldn't walk after being stood up for half and hour (not good for stacking shelves) and the stores response to this was me faking it to get time off to go to football matches, the cheek! Handed my notice in the day after that and haven't stepped foot in an asda since. 

It's an industry that in my experience (certainly not what you'd find in every shop or branch) is so bad to work in.

‚ÄúMr Kenber and Mr Mostrous,

Re: Nigel Farage and office costs

""I am extremely concerned that in your report you have distorted my responses to your questions regarding the Lyminster office costs.

""On the front page you quote me as stating that the costs were ¬£3000 per year. This is grossly incorrect. I told you that the previous manager had tied the office into some supply contracts and as a result the monthly costs were some ¬£2000. I told you several times that I eventually reduced the costs to ¬£700 per month. When I went to school we were taught the times tables and that ¬£700 times 12 equals ¬£8400 (which is not too far removed from Mr Farage‚Äôs ¬£1000 per month) so where on earth did you come up with a figure of ¬£3000?

""At no time did I say that ‚Äúelectricity, heating, and business rates at the office totalled less than ¬£250 a month‚Äù. I told you that I could not remember the individual amounts as it was over four years ago but they would have been in the region of ¬£200 each.

""Later, you then contradict yourselves by quoting me as saying that the costs were ¬£700 per month - which is correct. You asked me a number of times about the ¬£700/month figure which I confirmed several times; again I have to ask how does ¬£700 per month equate to ¬£3000 per year? I should also point out that our conversations were witnessed.

""To the best of knowledge and belief I was completely honest in my answers and resent the fact that those answers have been completely distorted. I did warn you that there is a small minority who are 'mischief makers' ‚Äì one in particular who would go to any lengths to destroy Mr Farage‚Äôs reputation.

""I expect you to publish corrections as outlined above.

""Finally, I should point out that the Lyminster is nowhere near Bognor Regis; it is on the outskirts of Littlehampton, a fact that could have been verified by looking at an AA road atlas!""

true,ieya404,cnty-uk,Edinburgh,"As far as I know they're planned to be the same price as the bus for journeys within the city, it's only when you take it out to the airport that the price jumps.

Think they're talking about a ten-minute service (compare to the current number 22 bus route that's four-minute during the day IIRC).

That said:

The trams were planned when there was also expectation for substantial development of Edinburgh's waterfront, up to another 40,000 or so extra people across the north of the city.

Now, the road network across north Edinburgh doesn't really have that much spare capacity, and so the trams would've provided a mass transit method of doing a lot of people movements.

There are a few minor drawbacks, namely:

* The developments stalled in the wake of the financial crisis (but weren't helped by the sheer number of ""2 bedroom luxury flats"" being built which weren't a lot of help for singles or families).
* So there aren't anything like 40,000 extra people in the north of Edinburgh.
* This is just as well, since the cut-back tram line doesn't go anywhere near the waterfront anyway (as a curious side note, at one point the council voted to terminate the tram line at Haymarket station, which would've left the tram line a truly pathetic length, but was the least-cost option.  Scottish Government said if they did that, it was a material change, and they'd not be getting the last fat wodge of cash from them.  Council duly about-turned and the tram line goes as far as York Place in the city centre.  Don't understand how that's not still a material change, given that York Place is nowhere near the waterfront...)

Honestly, what we've actually got now *does* seem pretty pointless; if they were only going to do a single line, then the first one they killed, Line 3, feels like it would've been the most sensible to keep (it would've run from the city centre, southwest through the university area, out to the Royal Infirmary)... logic's never seemed too strong a point in the Edinburgh Tram Saga though :-/",0,1397571489,null,0,false,0,cgszwa9,t3_230hnl,t1_cgszwa9,t1_cgsz2ph,null,1433364727,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So even though we do have players of great quality on the bench, they still aren't good enough to play against the likes of PSG and teams in the champions league. 

But I would also argue that you seem to over rate some players. Saying we have ""two first teams"" is very kind, thank you, but also very over rating some second tier players. 

I like that this sub is caught up on ""mind games"" because thats why those comments are said, to keep peoples thought off the game its self. 
To say chelsea has all the ""pressure"" on them is not true at all considering even if we win the game we aren't promised the title. Even if chelsea win out, they need City to drop 2 more points, unlike Liverpool. 

But anywho, thanks for reading. I cant wait for this match, because mourinho will actually have to go on the road to a top 4 side and play to win, not tie.

true,cscwtp,null,null,"&gt; The military spending would overall remain about the same or be cut considering they want to extricate us from all foreign conflicts. When people talk about the 40% increase they always conveniently leave that part out...

Why on earth would UKIP say they want to increase military spending by 40% if they actually want to decrease it?  It sounds like you are projecting your own views onto them.  Anyway, I believe this is all from their disowned 2010 manifesto, and their website currently doesn't say anything about the military at all, so who knows what their views are now?

&gt; On same sex marriage they've said they wont reverse it but want to make sure no institution is legally forced to carry out services they are ethically opposed to.

They did say they wouldn't take away the marriages of same-sex couples who have already got married, then they said [that statement was released by Farage's spokesperson without his approval](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/03/19/nigel-farage-appears-to-u-turn-again-on-same-sex-marriage/).  They don't appear to have a clear position one way or the other now.  There was never any realistic threat of religious organisations being forced to marry same-sex couples against their will, the same way there has never been any threat of them being forced to marry people from outside their religion against their will.  This was merely an excuse: they didn't want to offend either the pseudo-libertarians or the religious traditionalists, two of UKIP's major groups of supporters.

&gt; That's a compromise between the rights of gay people &amp; religious institutions.

UKIP wanted to ban same-sex couples from being allowed to get married altogether in order to assuage spurious concerns from churches (by coincidence, the same ones that were strongly opposed to same-sex marriage being legalized anyway) that they would no longer be allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies in the precise way they wanted.

'Wicked' I thought, 'I'm about to see a train'. No, turns out it is much better than a train. A motherfucking plane slowly rolls past the road, one of those little British Airways jets with the union jack painted across it's tail. My jaw drops to the ground. Then, equally as awesome, the barriers go back up and we are allowed to continue down the road, only it's not a road it's a bloody runway!

Then waiting for the coach to arrive for the return journey back to *Torremolinos*, there were two Harrier jump jets flying around Gibraltar in circles. Fighter planes! I'm 11 years old so to me this is amazing.

The Doctor gets away with it mainly because he has Protagonist Privileges and is a super-powered alien with a mind-bending reality ship. We don't really have these advantages, and as a result we occasionally have to make do with violence.

The Doctor says ""They were going away!"", but one defeat never stopped an invading force before. Daleks, Cybermen, and Zygons have returned for subsequent attempts. Realistically, the Doctor has no way of knowing the Sycorax will never return. I mean, he just killed the Sycorax leader himself *due to the exact same thing* - the Sycorax leader agreed not to attack, then did it anyway! And there are various other instances in which this sort of thing occurs. So why is ""No second chances"" - a line he delivers not five minutes before the destruction of the ship - OK for him, but not for humanity?

This just makes the Doctor look like a hypocrite for complaining when Earth declares war against aliens who've already declared war against them. ""I'm allowed to be ruthless to save humans, but you're not.""

In a story context, I don't mind that he did it because the Doctor shouldn't be infallible, especially not a couple of hours into his new body - though it's not as developed a story thread as it should have been, because the writers aren't really capable of mustering the energy to say anything negative about the Tenth Doctor.",0,1397573167,null,0,false,0,cgt0lyk,t3_232636,t1_cgt0lyk,t3_232636,null,1433365065,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; Surely it is crucial that his apology was sincere if one is going to justify a short prison sentence?

ish, but I have no reason to think it isn't. One of the biggest issues with tolerance is experience. Most intolerant people that distrust blacks, gays or muslims just lack experience of those individuals and the distrust builds and builds in their little echo-chamber. Now it seems this guy has finally gained a bit of perspective on the matter, he now knows an imam, an imam that forgave him. So when he's down the pub and someone starts bad mouthing the Muslims he can actually provide a touch of perspective, he knows an imam that was really fucking cool to him even after he was a complete dick.  He can contribute:

&gt; ""Not all Muslims are like that"".  

Which is the missing key of tolerance in some communities.

&gt; And I don't think stupid/easily led is the same thing as having a mental illness.

They're very entwined. As an example, the guy that chopped off Rigby's head in broad daylight had managed to fuck up his brain over the course of many years to such an extent that he thought killing him was the best course of action. Same goes for someone like Breivik.  
From the outside it looks like a mental illness (a sociopath perhaps?) but its often a negative/stupid/easily led type of thinking that's been brewing for a number of years that results in such insanity.  
A school shooting would be another, a child slowly getting pissed enough with bullying and social pressures that they convince themselves that shooting up a school is a logical and correct choice.  

If you can find a way to vent this steam before it hits critical mass and explodes in a catastrophic fashion then that's fucking great.

It made no sense to risk opening up and attacking them, when we know they would have to break us down otherwise. Let them come, then counter, like we've done so well most of the season. Didn't work, but I'm pretty sure that was the plan.

I don't think it was necessarily a bad choice to try and just hold on for a draw, potentially trying to nick one on the break if Palace were desperate enough to open up for us. If we'd gone at them and got carved open on the break, you'd be just as upset, I reckon. Lambert took the lower risk option. He lost the bet.

could you point to which genes in white biology make them better at being academics? I hate to break it to you but universities are recent **social** institutions which aren‚Äôt reflected in human biology

are not academics part of this culture, i.e. white culture? Universities aren't some neutral ground outside of culture to which white culture inherently has the ability to attain itself only, universities are white and thus white culture is the key to employment within them. White dominance reproduces itself just as white culture reproduces itself. 

If it was a cultural barrier it would only show the systemically racist culture that dominates British society

of course universities and education, isn't synonymous to intelligence, but they are very closely related. Intelligence itself is near impossible to define, that doesn't stop it having a long history in justifying the racial inequality in societies.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;So stating that your genetic makeup effects muscle tissue is ok but saying that it effects brain tissue is racist?

yes. because what constitutes intelligence is a social construction, and as such has no relationship to biology, however how fast you can run between x and y is merely a scientific measurement. Genetic makeup doesn‚Äôt determine ones ability it only offers the potential, hence if one doesn‚Äôt train or do sport they won‚Äôt be better at running than someone who does. Also there‚Äôs pretty much **no** genetic difference between what you call races. Athletics running success for example is defined by success dependant on literally fractions of a second; such a small basis of difference is either nothing to do with biology at all or is such a small basis of biological difference to make it irrelevance. Intelligence, as mentioned is not only socially defined, but when defined usually entail lots more social phenomena, once intelligence isn‚Äôt at all based on genetics, what is is one‚Äôs ability to learn (which itself can fluctuate depending on social experience) ‚Äì a couple of hundreds of years ago nearly all people were illiterate, today the vast majority aren‚Äôt, this wasn‚Äôt because of any biological shift but due to very concrete social processes. 

&gt;Maybe someone more scientifically inclined could correct/confirm

this is exactly the mentality of racists, they are also irrational dogmatists. Instead of looking at the facts of science and attempting rational and critical investigation, you assume straight away blacks are intellectually inferior and then anyone who disagrees has to provide the scientific evidence, again of course it would be too much to ask you to only assumes beliefs when the evidence exists to justify them.

There's no such thing as 'blackness', it is **not** a biological definition, what determines whether someone is black or not is a social construction (the same for whites). For example those who consider themselves whites (with pride) in Latin America are called non-whites in the USA. And freed slaves who returned to Africa were considered by natives to be 'whites'. In fact the first case of racism in history was the British being racist to the Irish, a racism which wasn‚Äôt founded upon constructions of colour in the skin, but rather other attributed ‚Äònatural‚Äô characteristics. Racism is a social division that attributes certain characteristics to certain groups based on certain **social** classifications. The racial hierarchies are radically different in different countries. 

Your talk of biology as such completely misses the point, for example south Europeans are biologically closer to North Africans than to northern Europeans. However they aren't divided as such in reality, they aren't divided upon any 'real' biological difference but differences based on certain social phenomena. That said their biological difference is unbelievably small to be of little or no relevance anyway. There are biological differences between all humans, it's is certain social processes that classify certain humans together in a group as opposed to another group and then attempt to find biological differences to justify that separation.

This is the same for gender, hence the prescience of this quote: 

*""If gender didn‚Äôt exist, what we call sex would be denuded of meaning, and would not be considered important: it would only be a physical difference like the others. Gender is not a social construction erected on the basis of groups already constituted by nature. What is physical (and is not in doubt), is not the substratum of gender, it is gender which creates the sexes, or in other words, gives meaning to physical traits which no more possess an intrinsic meaning than the rest of the physical universe.""*

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"
**Trophies**

* Premier League, FA Cup x2, Champions League, Europa League

**Players**

* Plenty of comings and goings. Out of the 23 man squad you'd be familiar with from pre-2010, only Cech, Terry, Ivanovic, Lampard, and A. Cole are still around. Apart from Ivanovic and Terry, there are questions as to whether or not the rest will return next season. All of them have been fantastic (and crucial to our many successes), it's an age thing.

* The most significant player story is that of Drogba, who as you may know carried us to our Champions league victory. His last kick of a ball in a Chelsea shirt was the winning penalty, and since then he has moved to Galatasary in Turkey. 

* At the end of last season Frank Lampard surpassed Bobby Tambling as our all-time top goalscorer, an incredible feat for a midfield player. 

* The youth: We have added to the squad a number of exciting young players that should be with us for many seasons to come. The likes of Eden Hazard and Oscar are already among the best in their position, yet only in their early 20's. We stockpiled so much talent (particularly in the attacking midfield area) that our 2-time player of the the season/talisman Juan Mata was transferred away (though there are a number of reasons). 

* Fernando Torres. 4-5 years ago the though of Torres moving to Chelsea would have been extremely exciting. In January of 2011 Chelsea paid a record ¬£50 million to acquire him from Liverpool...it's been an unmitigated disaster. Torres has consistently failed to perform, but due to the size of his transfer fees and wages managers have found it extremely difficult to drop him. As a result (particularly after the departure of Drogba) we've had a striker-sized hole in our team that has been a big handicap for a few years now. It's an emotional issue, he has received incredible support from the fans who want nothing more for him than to succeed. However, at this point most of us want him gone so we can move on as a club.

**Managers**

Owner Roman Abramovich has not become any less ruthless since the period 4-5 years ago. Despite a lot of success, managers have been coming and going with regularity.

* Carlo Ancelloti (2009-2011): In the 09/10 season Carlo led the team to its first ever League and FA cup double. after failing to win anything in the 10/11 season, he was unceremoniously sacked less than 2 hours after the last game of the season. Carlo was very popular with the players and the fans.

* Andre Villas-Boas (2011-2012): One of the brightest young managerial talents, AVB came to us after an incredible season with Porto (won the league undefeated, the domestic cup, and the Europa league). As a Portuguese and a former member of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea staff, comparisons were inevitable. However, the results did not match Mourinho's success. Andre's 'project' to implement a new playing style with younger players was off the pace in the league, and in serious trouble of making an early exit in the Champions league. He was sacked mid-season and replaced with his assistant Roberto Di Matteo. Since then AVB has also failed at Tottenham (hilariously) and is now plying his trade in the Russian league. 

* Roberto Di Matteo (2012-2013): A legend as a player and now as a manager, no one expected much from the interim man. He re-incorporated old guard players like Terry, Lampard, and Drogba who had been marginalized by AVB. This was crucial in staging one of the biggest comebacks in club history in the Champions league against Napoli, which of course led to us winning the competition itself. In between, we also won the FA cup yet again. Di Matteo could not correct AVB's poor league form, and we finished 5th (the lowest of the Abramovich era). However, by winning the Champion's League we qualified for the next season's competition anyways, hilariously voiding Tottenham's 4th place qualification. The FA cup/CL double forced Abramovich into offering Di Matteo the job on a long-term basis, though everyone knew it was never going to last. Di Matteo had the team playing brilliant attacking football in the beginning of the 12/13 season, but defensive frailties led to us dropping out of the Champions league group stage into the Europa league. Thus, Di Matteo was also sacked mid-season. 

* Rafa Benitez (2012-2013): Generally despised by Chelsea fans for is time at Liverpool, Benitez (aka the Fat Spanish Waiter) was hired to see out the 12/13 season; this made the loss of club-legend Di Matteo that much worse. Benitez ended up performing worse in the leauge than Di Matteo, failed in Club World Cup, failed in the league cup, and generally sucked. We fucking lost at home to QPR, who were relegated that season. To be fair, he made the most of our time in the Europa league and won it for the 1st time in our history (making us the only club to simultaneously hold the CL and EL trophies). Under Rafa, we only secured champions league for this season on the last day of 12/13. Thankfully he didn't stick around.

* Jose Mourinho (2013- ): I assume you remember Jose, the greatest manager in our history. In 2005 he won the league for us for the 1st time in 50 years, in his first season with us, with a record points total (which still stands). In his short time with us he won another league, 2 league cups, and an FA cup. Since then he's cemented his place as one of the best managers ever, winning a treble with Inter (becoming one of the few managers to win the CL with 2 different clubs) and helping Real Madrid to win the Spanish league against Barcelona (who during the last few seasons have been arguably the greatest team of all time). At the beginning of this season Jose returned to Chelsea, having completed his tour of Europe and looking to settle down long-term. He is completing the transitional phase that our squad has been in every since Ancelloti left, and the future looks bright.

**This Season**

We're challenging for the premier league, which we haven't done since Ancelloti. We're in the semi final of the Champion's league, after a comeback of Napoli-proportions against PSG.

of course the rule of white through imperialism in Africa has nothing to do with it...white systematically denied education to blacks during imperialism, and systematically enslaved, exploited and impoverished a whole continent...of course this exploitation is also the cause of whites economic dominance. Post-colonial independent countries are still suffering from colonialism, and the neo-colonial of the rule of White corporations and IMF debts that subjugate African nations, yet whites still expect blacks to immediately rise thus proving themselves, the fact they don't is thus granted as evidence of their inferiority and thus justifies the continuing hegemony and privilege of whites which in turn reproduces the parameters of inferiority. As such it's a completely reproducing cycle out of which the oppressed can never escape, a cycle constructed by whites to maintain their hegemony whilst attempting to proclaim their impartiality in affairs.

true,AzureSkyy,NG,nigeria,"I'll tell you a lil about every influential team!


Bayern are the team to beat (pep guardiola manages them now). With a combination of great signings and developed players. They have built a super solid squad. Some key players are Toni Kroos, Ribery (almost won ballon d'or last year), Robben, Muller, Mario Mandzukic (might leave), Mario Gotze, Thiago, Lahm, Schewinstager, and David Alaba. They are also the the UCL title holders.


Barca has fallen off, slowly but surely declining. I think that's due to old age of star players, lack of depth on the bench, and upper managerial problems. They have been facing a lot of scrutiny with the signing of young starlet Neymar. He is the next big thing along side Mario Gotze, Lucas Moura, and Eden Hazard. Taxes problems may leave them banned from 14/15 transfer windows. 


Real Madrid is making a full on Galaticos, with recent signing of Gareth Bale for 100m. They are still in the chase for Falcao/Luiz Suarez. Cristiano Ronaldo signed with them and in a lot of people's eyes has passed Messi in the ""best ever race"".  His finishing and leadership has been through the roof this season. They are looking really good and could win the UCL if they get past Bayern. 


Seria A (outside Juve) is a complete joke in comparison to European play. AC Milan and Inter Milan are just struggling. Who knows why, because both teams have the players to do well. But they can't produce results. Juve on the other hand has been on fire. They got regulated to the second league for cheating. Came back last year and won the League title. Their team has all the weapons and is just putting all the other teams into the dirt. Key players for Juve are Vidal, Pogba, Tevez, Marchisio, Pirlo, Buffon, Chellini, and some others.


Man City has been on the come up. They seemed to take Utd's role for the most powerful team in Manchester. They bought a lot of their players and haven't seen enough results to justify their spending. Key players are David Silva, Nasari, Yaya toure, Dzeko, Agurero, Hart, and Kompany.


Man Utd has fallen off ever since David Moyes has gotten there. I don't think he is at fault though. The team he has is actually quite poor. When they rebuild, i think they will regain that power. They will have to have a huge transfer window this year. Toni Kroos from Bayern is known to be their first option.


Chelsea, been damn near flawless lol. Jose Mourinho is now back in charge. We are building a dynasty. Buying a lot of players young. Making them work for their position on the team. Nobody's spot is secure in the starting XI so you always have to be on your best. We play with high tempo defense and counter attack now. Our lack of a striker has dropped us SEVERAL points and is our main focal point this coming transfer window.

Arsenal, good at midseason with the signing of young ex-Real Madrid man, Mesut Ozil. He is IMO the best CAM in the world. He set shit on fire alongside Giroud, Ramsey, and Kosliency. Young players who also are good looking prospects. Then typical arsenal happened and several injuries struck them. Wengers lack of strength during the transfer window didn't add depth to the squad. Allowing them to fall behind. His job MIGHT be in jeopardy due to the lack of silverware. He has a chance to win the FA Cup this year though, so who knows lol. 

Liverpool, Dortmund, and Altetico Madrid have all made a name for theirselves in recent years. Brendan Rodgers, former padawan of mourinho, has taken over Liverpool and turned them into a power house with some great managerial skills, and great signings. Daniel Sturridge, Luis Suarez, Coutinho, and Raheem Sterling are all threatening for them. Dortmund has had a super youth team/transfers that have brought them to a lower table team to in the UCL finalist/League winners. Injury hit them hard this season and is the main reason for the lack of form. Along side the fact that Bayern poached their best player, Mario Gotze, a Dortmund native. Robert Lewandowski, a star ST for Dortmund, will be jointing them too during the 14/15 campaign. Jurgen Klopp is their head coach. Really passionate guy, and he is probably going to be the next big manager along side Brendan Rodgers. Altetico Madrid is a great team. On paper they don't look that good, but the amount of heart they play with is just amazing. When they play they always put 130%. It's amazing to watch. They might even win the league too. Key players for them are Gabi, Felipe Luis, Diego Costa, David Villa, Koke, Courtois (Chelsea's on-loan GK who they want to keep), and Turan. 


Good international teams are - Spain, Germany, Argentina, Portugal, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Belgium, and Urugray

Teams who have fallen off since 5 years ago - ENGLAND (OMG they are so bad), Netherlands, France (getting better), Italy, Russia, Sweden (not in WC), and some others.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster#The_Sun

I make no apologies for the length of this quote :

&gt; On 19 April, four days after the disaster, Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The ~~Sun~~, a British red-top tabloid newspaper with national distribution owned by Rupert Murdoch, used ""THE TRUTH"" as the front page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: ""Some fans picked pockets of victims"", ""Some fans urinated on the brave cops"" and ""Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life"".

&gt; The newspaper cited the words of unnamed police officers and Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick for information relating to the alleged incidents.The Daily Express also carried Patnick's version, under the headline ""Police Accuse Drunken Fans"" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the ""mayhem caused by drunks"" and that policemen told him they were ""hampered, harassed, punched and kicked"".

&gt; The story accompanying the ~~Sun~~ headlines claimed ""drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims"" and ""police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon"". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a dead girl had been ""abused"", and that Liverpool fans were ""openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead"". These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims and gave first aid to many of the injured.

&gt; In their history of The ~~Sun~~, Peter Chippendale and Chris Horrie wrote:

&gt; As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed‚Äî""looking like rabbits in the headlights""‚Äîas one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it‚Äîthey just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.

&gt; After The ~~Sun~~'s report, the newspaper was boycotted by most newsagents in Liverpool and many readers cancelled orders and refused to buy it from newsagents. The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper's sales, which some commentators considered a reason for continued price cuts, the introduction of free magazines, and video and free DVD offers. The issue was addressed on the documentary Alexei Sayle's Liverpool on BBC Two when it covered the subject of Hillsborough. The segment saw comedian Alexei Sayle with a newsagent attempting to give away copies of The ~~Sun~~, but every customer declined. Eventually, Sayle and the newsagent took the copies outside and set them alight.

&gt; MacKenzie explained his actions in 1993. Talking to a House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee, he said: ""I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said. It was a Tory MP. If he had not said it and the Chief Superintendent (David Duckenfield) had not agreed with it, we would not have gone with it.""

&gt; MacKenzie repudiated the apology in November 2006, saying he apologised because the newspaper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, had ordered him to do so, stating: ""I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now"". MacKenzie refused to apologise when appearing on the BBC's topical Question Time on 11 January 2007.

&gt; The ~~Sun~~ apologised for its treatment of the Hillsborough disaster ""without reservation"" in a full page opinion piece on 7 July 2004, saying it had ""committed the most terrible mistake in its history"" by publishing it. The newspaper apologised in response to criticism of Wayne Rooney, a Liverpool-born footballer who then played for Everton, who had sold his life story to the newspaper. Rooney's actions incensed Liverpudlians still angry with the newspaper whose apology was somewhat bullish, saying the ""campaign of hate"" against Rooney was organised in part by the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo, owned by Trinity Mirror‚Äîarch-rivals of The ~~Sun~~. The apology angered some Liverpudlians further. The Liverpool Echo did not accept the apology, calling it ""shabby"" and ""an attempt, once again, to exploit the Hillsborough dead"".

&gt; On 6 January 2007, during Liverpool's FA Cup match at Anfield, fans in the Kop held up coloured cards spelling out ""The Truth"" and chanted ""Justice for the 96"" for six minutes at the start of the game. The protest was directed at Kelvin MacKenzie, The ~~Sun~~, and the BBC for employing MacKenzie.

&gt; The controversy was referred to at the 2009 Labour Party conference. On 30 September 2009, after the decision by The ~~Sun~~ to switch support to the Conservative Party in advance of the 2010 general election, Union Leader Tony Woodley ripped up a copy saying ""In Liverpool we learnt a long time ago what to do.""

&gt; Subsequent articles in The ~~Sun~~ have said hooliganism was not a cause of the disaster; on the 20th anniversary an article by journalist Mike Ellis condemned the 1991 inquest verdict of death by misadventure as ""tosh"" and claimed that ""death by negligence would have been a more accurate description"".

&gt; Others in the media pinned the blame partly on Liverpool fans, including the Daily Star, which ran the front page headline ""Dead Fans Robbed By Drunk Thugs"" on 18 April 1989. The Sheffield Star published similar allegations to The ~~Sun~~, running the headline ""Fans In Drunken Attacks On Police"", and the Liverpool Daily Post published an article entitled ""I Blame the Yobs"".

&gt; Anger about The ~~Sun~~'s reporting continues. James Murdoch apologised on its behalf to the phone hacking select committee in 2012.

&gt; On 12 September 2012, after the publication of the report exonerating the Liverpool fans, MacKenzie issued the following statement:

&gt; Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline. I too was totally misled. Twenty three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield [White's] in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP (Sheffield Hallam MP Irvine Patnick) were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster. As the Prime Minister has made clear these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the disaster from themselves. It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline 'The Lies' rather than 'The Truth'. I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.

&gt; Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected MacKenzie's apology as ""too little, too late"", calling him ""lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife"".

&gt; The sales of The ~~Sun~~ remain poor in Merseyside and a boycott is still practised. Its articles are not published on Liverpool's official website. In 2004, its average daily circulation in Liverpool was 12,000 copies a day.",0,1397580760,null,0,1397581644,0,cgt4a5f,t3_233cmd,t1_cgt4a5f,t1_cgt33eq,null,1433366861,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

A couple of years later you hear how she's doing from someone else and you feel a little bit sad about the state she's got herself into for a while before realising she's not your problem anymore.

That's how I am with Torres. I was gutted he left. Absolutely heartbroken...not because it was him, per se...more that the previous 18 months had seen so many of our best players leave for supposedly better things. Alonso, Arbeloa, Masch, Nando. It was a time when the club had just reached its lowest point in most supporters' living memories (narrowly escaping admin, just got rid of Woy Hodgson). It was not a good time for the club and Nando leaving was the icing on top of a shit-filled cake, despte the fact he'd been largely out of it for the past 9 months anyway.

I had all sorts of emotions going through me when he left. His first match for Chelsea was against Liverpool, iirc. I went to the pub with a mate of mine and we sat there, half of us wearing Liverpool shirts, the other half Chelsea and we went through so many emotions just in 90 minutes. Sadness, anger, acceptance, happiness. I cheered when Agger elbowed him in the face. Not proud of it now haha but I did.

Now, my entire sense of feeling for Torres can be summed up in one word: apathy. Complete and utter apathy. I don't care if he scores, I don't care if he doesn't. Honestly, I find Liverpool supporters who say ""oh I get so happy when Torres scores"" a bit strange. Fuck that, he plays for someone else. He's just another player to me these days.

Maybe I'm alone in that, maybe I'm not. I think you'll find a relatively even split in opinions on him though. Some still wish he never left, others realise we're probably on to something better these days anyway. I'm one of the latter, most definitely.

Not in the slightest.  

My younger brother bought a Torres jersey the year before we sold him, [I absolutely loved the old Merseyside ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0S5Tmd25WY), his song was brilliant, and he [dissed us](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/8295455/Chelseas-Fernando-Torres-says-Im-at-top-level-club-now-after-leaving-Liverpool.html) on the way out.

I relish every goalless game, every frustrated facial expression, every time he is beat to the ball.

Call me sadistic, call me what you will, but I really, really enjoy watching him fail.  

In terms of what actually happened to him, I just don't think there has ever been any chemistry on the Chelsea time like there is in Liverpool.  Having the opportunity to be inspired under the leadership of Captain Fantastic, playing in front of a crowd that adores your every touch on the ball, and sings the your praises in a spirit of loyalty and passion is irreplaceable.  It is a spark that can light a fire.  I don't think he's been able to find that spark at Chelsea.

In a lot of ways, religion is nothing but a societal cultural response, or worse, symptom. It would also seem like a huge coincidence, no?, that cultural issues go so hugely hand in hand with one specific religion. 

Islam in the modern age leads to very little other than conflict, hatred and oppression. This isn't a rare or uncommon view, and one that is shared by many political commentators. The religion itself lends itself very very well to dictatorship and specifically very well to the hatred of women, homosexuals and other 'lesser' members of society. As a female I specifically am very afraid that one day me or my daughters will be oppressed in a way that it does not take much focus or searching to find, in fact, it terrifies me and chills me to my core. As a feminist, I find it utterly and totally disgusting and abhorrent. 

This was a religion founded in a part of the world under incredible torment, and it is reflected in the literature. Comparing the new testament to the qu'ran is like comparing a Cradle of Filth song with Justin Bieber, there is a clear and defined leaning towards violence. Historically, a religion which has achieved much, has been perverted from any peaceful course by men with hatred in their hearts and in the modern world it should play no piece on the world stage.

It's fair to say Islamic people have a history of taking their faith and beliefs too far, but then so do a lot of people regardless of what religion or belief system they aspire to follow. Besides which this current resurge in the strength and reach of islam has a lot more to do than merely extremism. Various scholars into the early 20th century have been influential at least in the east, and the last century's events have too (israel settling, the resulting wars, toppling of iran's democracy and the resulting revolution, the fall of pan Arabism should probably wade in there somewhere also). 

You give it time and things might settle, you stop postulating interventionist wars are an option you may get a better reaction. On that point I'll add that even Osama thought a protracted war could be a benefit to his cause as we all bankrupt each other.

Extremism in all it's forms concerns me but Islam in of itself doesn't bother me. Our reactions to that concern over extremism should be tempered in order to not ruin ourselves whilst we attempt to deal with it.

As to why people might notice it more now? Well we've been stuck in some wars for a while now, the predominant non-muslim populations of the western world are consistently worrying about terrorism and the media responds by reflecting and affecting that obsession.

here are some reasons *why* some of them are anecdotal some of them were national headlines to avoid painting all my evidence as inconsequential:

I had a message from my mate who is a soldier awhile ago saying he's leave has been cancelled and couldn't meet for a drink an the entire base he lives on was locked down due to 4 muslim men attempting to force a squaddie into a car at knifepoint, he fought them off and sustained slash wounds an was stitched up at the local A&amp;E, if he hadn't he *would* be dead now. (this is the type of thing the IRA used to do btw, who we were by all definitions at war with)

And then we've got the Lee Rigby incident, a successful attempt on a soldiers life on UK soil.. 

And then we've got the 7/7 bombings

And then we've got the Birmingham schools 'takeover plot' whereby a Trojan Horse dossier was leaked revealing a plot to overthrow teachers in secular state schools

Most important things to note here

1) This will result in a new company 33.3% jointly owned by Sky,TT and CityFibre - this will be a similar company to Openreach - Selling on network access to FTTP back to the other companies.

Personally I feel this will leave us to the wolves. The US will stomp all over us and we'll slide into a mini-US privatising everything and becoming a shadow of our former selves. I just don't think we can compete economically alone and we require a union to remain relevant in the next era of super powers (US, EU, India, China, Russia). Population count is going to be very important, globalization means a downtick for us in the West in terms of average wage as the East takes our business and we'd be wise to unionize among the EU to offset this and gain preferential trade terms.

I think the currency isn't necessarily a bad thing to have. While avoiding the present Euro issues is nice its worth remembering that someone could still Black Wednesday our piddly little currency if they wish. I genuinely think we'll live to regret joining if we don't. Sure it'd likely be worse short-term but I think it a strong long-term decision.  

The political union agenda is probably where we would find the most common ground here as that does have the potential to make me uneasy. However I find our European brothers to be reasonably culturally aligned with us which makes me think we'll always be pulling in roughly the same direction.  

My biggest issue with EU withdrawal is that I don't see a plan B. We won't be able to protect our blue collar jobs from going abroad and without the attraction of the union it will be harder to bring in more blue collar jobs. I think its worth noting that the EU as a block will be the _strongest_ (in terms of GDP and beating the US for population) economic force, that's part of why its such an attractive option.

So one of the *seven hundred and twenty two* murders in the UK last year was a result of extremist Islam. Care to reference any others, or do you accept that this makes it .13% of the murder rate in the UK?

He claims the suspensions of Culverhouse and Karsa ARE for long term underperformance and they have effectively been sacked.

&gt;___Primer___ is a 2004 American [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) [drama film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_film) about the accidental discovery of a means of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel). The film was written, directed, and produced by [Shane Carruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Carruth). *Primer* is of note for its extremely low budget (completed for $7,000), experimental plot structure, philosophical implications, and complex technical dialogue, which Carruth, a college graduate with a degree in mathematics and a former engineer, chose not to simplify for the sake of the audience.  The film collected the [Grand Jury Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sundance_Film_Festival_award_winners#2004) at the 2004 [Sundance Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival), before securing a limited release in the United States, and has since gained a [cult following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following).

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; Iceland, a country of less than half a million was able to make a good trade deal with China last year, so I'm sure we could.

A pity deal if anything. Iceland are economically irrelevant so I'm sorry to brush this one off but I currently live here and I know that economically speaking Iceland means absolutely nothing. The trade deal China gave them is akin to giving a chocolate bar to a kid on the streets of Delhi. We're more an annoying street trader in that analogy, so we wont get a chocolate bar too.

&gt; Anglosphere countries would be a good target for trade deals, rich in resources and they speak the same language, and we share a cultural heritage.

Don't count the US as they've proven time and time again that friendship means _nothing_ in business. However the old commonwealth would be our best bet here. Nigeria, Malaysia, possibly India. That could work out but we'd need to unionize with these countries in a similar fashion to the EU.... which is kinda the same thing.

&gt; We have a niche in our business and service economy in Europe

Our ""niche"" is mostly banking (27% of our GDP or so?) which is a bit suspect these days.... I'm worried about the common jobs though. I don't see anyway to keep these where we can offer a livable wage while competing.  

The basic premise I'm talking about is being able to protect our internal industries and exports at the same time. Lets imagine India decides to dump a bunch of corn on us at a ridiculously low rate that we can't compete with. From my understanding all we can do to protect ourselves is tariff but then India counter-tariffs and our exports to India (imagine a future India with an affluent middle-class). The hurt for us there is missing out on the Indian market or losing our internal market. We can't compete because we're smaller and we're not part of a union.  
Conversely being in the EU enables us to apply the tariff as a block and if India counter tariff then we're just playing the ""who has a bigger market"" game which works out at a draw and then we compromise as we both want access to each other's market.  
I don't see how we can manage this scenario without a union because we lack natural resources to use as a crutch. Sure we can scrape by with agreements from other small nations but as soon as we come anywhere near the big table we will just get smacked down.  
That's my interpretation of the future and why personally I think remaining part of the European Union will be positive for our economic heritage that outweighs any present day cons.",0,1397585285,null,0,false,0,cgt6lx6,t3_233fks,t1_cgt6lx6,t1_cgt5ub7,null,1433367958,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Several years on and we are building a team of real strength and integrity, Suarez for all of his previous problems, has been a catalyst to this seasons success, we have brought in misfits and showed the world they are quality players who just needed some belief, we have trusted our youngsters instead of buying lavishly, finally we have a club you can look at, that is not just a team of lots of good players, but a team where every player understands their role as player, and representative to Liverpool FC.

So, really, had we held on to him, the future might have been very different for Liverpool FC, so I just hope he goes to Atletico, and enjoys his final years of top flight football.

There are plenty of recycling facilities around the city. There are also charities and volunteers that will do free uplifts of recycling if you're disabled, or just can't be bothered to walk to a council one. There's a food waste one with your regular bin too.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","There's two things going on here:

1. The cost.

Bodyshops are incredibly expensive. Getting even a relatively small scratch filled and resprayed will easily cost a few hundred pounds. So if your girlfriend was expecting the cost to be in the region of ¬£50-100, she's living in cloud cuckoo land.

2. The fact that the work hasn't been done and yet they've presented an invoice and are demanding payment.

This, to my lay ears, is fraud. The little old lady obviously wasn't too bothered about the vehicle otherwise she'd have had the pre-existing damage fixed up long ago. Combine that with the fact that she's had her employer cook up a fake invoice - because if it was genuine, it'd be a quote and there would be none of this ""won't release the car"" bullshit - either she's hoping your girlfriend will pay to repair all the damage or she doesn't care about the damage being repaired, she just wants to milk someone for some money.

What I'd do is this:

 - Photograph the vehicle from several angles, covering all the damage - not just the damage your girlfriend was responsible for. Get several copies of the photos printed and highlight the damage that your girlfriend is responsible for with a permanent marker on each.
 - Write a letter explaining exactly what you've told us. Explain that these photographs were taken AFTER the damage was supposedly repaired and the vehicle was being held, that you've highlighted the damage your girlfriend was responsible for. 
 - Give a copy of the letter and the photos to your local police station; report it as fraud and get a crime reference number. 
 - Find out the name of the garage's director (assuming it's a limited company and not some little back-street mechanic) and post letter and photos to his home address, along with a note that you have reported it to the police as fraud. There's a good chance he doesn't know his staff are up to this, and if he's any good he'll be absolutely livid.
 - Send a copy to trading standards. You won't be the first person they've tried to rip off.
 - Are they associated with a main dealership? Send a copy to the vehicle manufacturer; many of these dealerships are franchises and I'm sure the manufacturer would love to know about a franchisee doing this.
 - Send a copy to your local newspaper. 
 - Keep a couple of copies for yourself. If they get insurance involved (which I don't think they will from what you've said), send a copy to your insurer. ",0,1397587141,null,0,false,0,cgt7k79,t3_2335iq,t1_cgt7k79,t3_2335iq,null,1433368406,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
