You absolutely should set up a direct debit to pay off the full balance of your credit card each month, in order to avoid incurring any interest. Then, you should use a credit card for all your daily expenses. 

There are benefits to doing so: since credit card companies charge a fee to retailers for your transactions, the credit card company is able to share a portion of that revenue with you. This is in the form of cashback, or rewards vouchers, etc. You'll also have the cashflow benefit of paying for your expenses around 50 days after the fact.

true,BestFriendWatermelon,null,null,"The meaning of APR has already been explained, but I'll add:

Loan companies are required to advertise their APR, regardless of whether it's a bank or payday lender. APR is the percentage rate of repayment ANNUALLY.

This is unfortunate for payday lenders (although they don't garner much sympathy) because they argue that it's only a short term loan for a month or two max. The loan does stop escalating, rather than keep rising and rising to insane levels as other replies work it out.

I had a girlfriend who got into trouble with payday loans. Borrowed £100 and ended up paying back about £300. Still extortionate, but not the doom and gloom thousands implied by the APR. 

If Wonga could advertise their rate of interest in terms of days, it wouldn't look so bad. 

To simplify, for a 20 year £200,000 mortgage, you might expect to pay 110% of the value back at something like 10% APR. i.e. £220,000 total.*

On a one month £100 loan, you might expect to pay the same 110%, £110 back at the end of the month. But the APR on that would calculate out to 1200%. It's not insane to take a loan out and pay 110% for it. It's just the way the APR numbers work out comparing short term and long term loans.

Having said all this, payday loans are a rotten, terrible idea. I've never known anyone take them out and not regret it. If you're short on money and can't wait until payday, chances are you'll be even shorter on money next month, and things spiral out of control. Beg, borrow, even take out a credit card first.

   Black does not reflect light well at all, headlights hitting you do not illuminate you very well...Please take notice of this, so many kids just step out into main roads expecting cars to slow down for them, when they can be virtually invisible in certain situations. I have had to do a few emergency stops because of people like this.

I rarely fail to spot someone walking along the pavement wearing, even a non reflective coloured jacket. Those cheap gaudy coloured hoodies, make you extremely visible at night.

Also our night vision is constantly being reset by drivers on the other side of the road, with their ridiculous hid lights. It's almost like little camera flashes constantly. this combined with if someone has greasy smudges on their windscreen,it will reduce their vision even more. (light scatters over the windscreen smudges, kinda looks like the star trek movie). point is, you can see a lot better outside at night as a pedestrian, walking along a busy road. than we can see you.

I actually just found an amazing article, written by  ""Visual expert Marc Green, PHD"". wich explains all of my points in much better detail. I would urge ""nightwalkers"" to have a read, it is really illuminating.

No worries.        
The misleading is troubling, however it is also easy to see how we could have been mislead by Saddam. When he has captured he confessed that he couldn’t have let Iran know he didn’t have them for fear of reprisals. I think the big issue is that it had to be a preventative measure; you couldn’t have removed Saddam if he had nukes. By making us responsible for deaths he also made us liberators of 35 million Iraqis and 5 million repressed Kurds.  A lot of good came from Iraq, we may not think it but it has, unfortunately those sort of stories don’t sell well in the papers.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"&gt; I do wonder who actually still opposes legalization

I kind of see how this is working.

Basically I'm studying addiction physcology, counselling and psychoanalysis  and the way this subject is approached academically is to demonise those who use cannabis as hardcore drug addicts from the off. I was reading a chapter the other day on counselling convicted drug users that suggested that they should be approached with caution in the early stages of counselling as they tend to be manipulative liars who will deceive a counsellor to set the pace of the session for their own gain. 

Here's a small taste of one of the passages: 

&gt;The information the client will divulge to the counsellor with regard to their using habits will be a mixture of fantasy, half-truths, wishful thinking, but most of all, blatant lies. The user will expect the counsellor to believe unequivocally the data being provided by him or her. Should the client ever get to the stage where he or she believes the counsellor perceives him or her as lying, the counsellor will have 'lost' the client.

Now, as a long term user of cannabis ( not for the last few years though ) I obviously know that this is pretty much bollocks quite frankly. I don't believe that cannabis is a drug that brings about that kind of manipulative thinking. Heroin maybe, cocaine maybe, cannabis, no.

The rhetoric of some of what I've been studying on cannabis has pretty much shocked me to be honest. 

But - and this is my point - when the people going into practising psychoanalysis and/or drug counselling ( who have no real world experience of cannabis from a users perspective )  are being fed this king of propaganda from the early stages of their academic career then it's no wonder they're presenting a biased account of cannabis users. The problem with this information unfortunately is that these are the very people who are advising those in a position of power on legislation. 

Now, I'm no expert on this subject ( well unless I can count my own problems with drugs use )  but I feel that if this is the thinking then cannabis has some pretty large hurdles to get over before it's ever even considered for legalisation in this country. 

Hopefully one day that will change.

In ICT we learnt how to make memorandums, databases (but not really, we just had to copy the teacher but I really liked it so I carried on learning) and how to make movies in movie maker. In computing GCSE we made simple programs like hangman, calculators and online form verification. In AS level computing, there is no actual marks for making a program so that takes a small section, it is mostly theory about things like networks, protocols, data buses, fetch execute cycle, data security and hardware/software.

ICT GCSE was (and probably still is) complete bullshit. Everything they taught us I already knew apart from access (But I learnt everything we had to know from a 15 minute video on youtube). I was the only one who actually knew how to make a database, but there was so much bullshit about making reports and creating a timelime of your work. ICT needs to be changed rapidly, most of it is about stuff you already know or just copying your teacher. You dont learn any real skills. ICT I think should have at least a small computing section to spark interest for people who have never tried it. Maybe something like web design which is pretty easy and even a small amount of coding can create something pretty good. Also, they should scrap the no child left behind in ICT lessons.

Of course it would, but when your trying to counter an argument that Nationalists are not moving forward, on the basis that the leader of Sinn Fein claims he was never in the IRA, it's not far fetched or unreasonable to think that my acknowledgement of their existence could be enough for you to suggest or suspect that I am in support of their actions.

If you keep looking for gremlins you will keep finding them. The fact that you mentioned Sinn Feins possible involvement with the IRA first and foremost, tells me all I need to know.... Maybe it's because I wasn't born when he was supposed to be in it that I don't give a fuck or maybe it's because wether or not he was in it has absoutley fuck all to do with the future.

In regard to the long term mental health impact of weed, if you chain smoke joints for years on end then your brain is going to suffer. If you smoke weed in small amounts on an irregular basis then it's far less harmful. The same as drinking. Obviously there will be genetic quirks or pre-existing mental health issues that change this, but you also get this with booze and to a certain degree coffee. 

The driving argument is an interesting one, simply because we have no idea how to test for it. The tests we have for weed are generally geared towards detecting its presence rather than determining how much you have consumed and how recently, and it also shows up way beyond the point it's ceased having any mental effects. Technically today it's possible for a heavy smoker to test positive for weed weeks after they last consumed it.

*Due to Blind’s exceptional qualities he was often the catalyst to retaining stability in defensive plays, often making the correct decisions at vital times.

They give you a spreadsheet to record of all of your invoices, income and expenditures. You email this to them quarterly, they confirm the VAT calculations in the spreadsheet are correct and then you file with HMRC. So for  ~£1500/year, they look at VAT figures 4 times and then prepare your company and personal returns. 

In my experience they offered no personalised service. It felt like a package deal where everyone gets exactly the same tax advice regardless of their personal circumstances. For example, I was not advised that there was a limit to the amount of tax free dividends I could take per year. They didn't warn me when I went over this limit and I ended up owing several thousand to HMRC.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"&gt;  do alcoholics display the same behaviour of lying about their usage

Only in the denial stage but that's one of the places you have to get them past in order to deal with their issues. I mean I obviously get where they're coming from, a convicted cannabis user or someone made to go into counselling as part of their punishment  (or even by family members ) is probably going to lie or downplay their usage because they basically don't want to be there or don't feel that they need help, that's a given.  

My problem however is if they're being lumped into the same groups as hard drug users from the off in the material I'm studying. Personally I don't feel that this should be the case and although some people no doubt suffer mental health issues from smoking weed ( usually in the high THC content end of things and usually with a genetic predisposition to mental health issues in the first place ) they're definitely the minority with this drug. 

I will add that everything I quoted in the original comment was from my reading material on cannabis; not Cocaine, Heroin, Crack and other class A drugs.

Why, exactly, should we expect these fracking fields to come on-line instantly? And for that matter, why do we expect renewables to take so long?

Oilfields don't develop instantly. The major issue with renewable development is planning permission and various other approvals - an issue that one would hope will apply equally to fracking.

Usually they are held due to risk to juries, risk to witnesses and the risk of revealing undercover agents and so on.

The defendant is still entitled to all the rights that anyone else has as a defendant and can appeal and all that carry on.

I will say that the judges tend to be very fair and switched on and if I ever end up as a defendant i really, really, really don't want a jury and would rather have the judge deciding on the case.

Nationalists are moving on? I would agree with that, then I look to Derry, where a councillor with dissident republican ties was elected. He also topped the polls there. To me, that doesn't appear to be moving on, I know this isn't the case all over N.I.

Personally, I think that the bitter on either side are becoming more bitter. This then gets fed through a tube to their children, who then inherit this gene. In fact, I can give you a personal example:

When I was being raised, I was often told about IRA murders, such as the Kingsmill massacre and the Corporals' killings. One mention of the phrase ""Bloody Sunday"" would be shot down with a rocket. Fortunately I was curious enough to go looking, where I found out about Bloody Sunday, about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I also know of the horrible treatment nationalists received at the hands of unionists, I know of the corruption of the RUC, but there was corruption in the Garda too. My own curiosity is the only reason that I know that both sides in this are just as tainted as the other. Or they were at some point anyway.

I digress... To say that Nationalists are moving on is not 100% true, I believe that they are moving on *more* than unionists, but I don't agree that nationalists are fully moving on - at least not to the extent of crossing the divide. Unionists aren't even close to that yet.

Is a United Ireland the key to solving the problems of sectarianism? Yes! And... No! I would explain in greater detail if you want.

Well, that's that. Sorry for the wall of text.

**TL;DR : Nationalists are moving on better than unionists for the most part, but are far from perfect. A United Ireland both solves and ignites sectarianism.

true,MadArend,num20,,"A common complaint about Dembele is that he slows play down too much, and plays safe passes rather than incisive ones that move our attack forward.  I think these problems largely boil down to his playing this past season on a team with either a deeply conservative plan (AVB) or no plan at all (Sherwood).  He looked especially bad under Sherwood, when no one had any clue where they were supposed to be and where their teammates were supposed to be.

In a team with a decent attacking scheme, where players actually know where they and each other are supposed to be (and *going* to be), Dembele drives play forward with both his dribbling *and* passing.  His play in the first half of 2012-13 under AVB -- when players were given clear (albeit allegedly complicated) instructions on positioning and movement, and we had speedy wingers flying forward and Defoe making clever runs and Dempsey/Gylfi making late runs to mop up --was brilliant.  We had the best and most lightning-fast counterattack in the league, and Dembele was at the heart of it.  As I recall, during that period, there was some stat making the rounds that Spurs hadn't lost a game that Dembele had started, and we were outscoring opponents by some hideous margin when he was on the pitch.

I haven't seen that much of him with Belgium, but the couple of times I have, he has powered the attack forward and been very dynamic then as well.

His hip is clearly a problem (especially in the later parts of both of the past two seasons).  As Jayesar said, we need to bite the bullet and do whatever it takes to get him healthy. 

If he's healthy and surrounded by a well-drilled team with an intelligent plan, Dembele will be as good as he was in the first half of 2012-13, when he was probably **the best** box-to-box midfielder in the Premier League and one of the best in the world.

Tax revenue is up and drug related crime levels are dropping. There is even a story on Reddit about this happening in Colorado.  It is a repeatable pattern everywhere cannabis has been legalised; crime goes down, tax revenue goes up. 

Considering certain countries in Europe are ahead of America in this regard there are no reports of long term problems with making this substance legal; beyond tourists getting hammered... but that remains a problem in areas popular with a certain age group regardless.

Generally speaking, I'd say his injury prone-ness was more of a cause for concern than his form. I'm thinking that the reason behind his 10/11 form was him being fatigued. He had an injury free season at Chelsea for the second time in 6 years, so not only does that take its toll. But also the world cup gave no chance for rest in what was a season in which you could almost predict that the front 3 would be: Malouda - Drogba - Anelka.

I wasn't judging their peaks and comparing their prices. I am looking at how they were when we bought them. 

At 22 million, Torres had been the star of his Atletico Madrid team for at least  four years and had captained them for 19 on. Moreover, he was widely touted as one of the best young players around. He was also far younger than Lallana is now. 

Suarez had ridiculous goal to game (game to goal?) ratios at Ajax for two seasons. He had also done well in Europe. And this isn't some ordinary Dirk Kuyt at Feyenoord ratio, he legitimately scored more goals than matches he played in one of them. He was also younger than Lallana is now. 

Lallana has played well this season in the Prem, but one good season in the Premier League isn't good enough to warrant 25 million pounds. That's more than what was paid for Suarez and Torres when they were actually stars in their respective teams for multiple years and performed well in Europe.

I think you're vastly underplaying how well Suarez and Torres were regarded. Chelsea bid 28 million on Torres in 2003, when he was 19.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"I'm sorry but you are 100% wrong. It wasn't just about Mata back-tracking it was also his lack of pressing higher up the pitch. Watch Willian and see how he plays. Watch Oscar. Watch Matic. Watch Ramires. Hell, Azpi even presses the GK. Everyone presses to win possession back and counter or catch the other team off-guard. That is counter-attacking 101. That is how we play.

What you are referring to is the low block, which is a different tactic altogether, and one which we have used sparingly; mainly due to the fact that we were short on players in certain areas of the pitch and/or Jose having a lack of faith in the side to be able to take all their chances. Basically, we've only ever used it when Jose has felt we won't be able to compete in attack with the other team. 

One thing Jose always said back in the day was he ""trusts his players"". He said that with 100% conviction when he used to take off a defender for a striker, i.e. he was able to trust that the team wouldn't concede despite having only 3 defenders on the pitch. Why? Because he knew that every player on the pitch would do their best not to concede.He has always wanted that in his teams. I also remember him saying that he would rather win a match 1-0 than 3-1. He HATES conceding goals. His strategy has evolved since then into being slightly more attacking, but his basic mentality is the same - to be solid at the back. And you cannot do that with players who don't press or know how to tackle/mark effectively. Even at Arsenal, Fabregas used to play with Song and Diaby in midfield or Song and Flamini, i.e. he always wanted the freedom to be able to attack and not have to worry about defending.",0,1401937748,null,0,false,0,chzioq8,t3_27bs9h,t1_chzioq8,t1_chzhvj7,null,1434099954,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Every piece of music for the buzzers, every picture they show, and every video all have copyrights that have to be tracked down, get permission, and then paid for. The bbc has a special deal and that's why they can use them, but in america it would cost a fortune just to get a couple of songs used. That's why they still haven't shown it here. 

30 Rock is hilarious, and I would love to see a female host. Not just because it would make it different enough to take on it's own personality (like the office was able to do) but also because there is a need for smart intelligent female comedians in america. As I was trying to think of a good female host, all of the women I kept thinking of were british. We don't have a Victoria Coren Mitchell, Sandi Toksvig, Lauren Laverne, or Joe Brand (who, while her husband shtick is annoying is quite intelligent). There have been some terrific women on @midnight, but that still isn't a forum that displays an education intellect. Tina Fey (especially in the weekend update role) is the closest we've come to a smart, funny, unapologetically intelligent and learned female comic. I would love to see more of it. First female comics couldn't be attractive because people were uncomfortable laughing *at* someone they wanted to sleep with.  Now women can be attractive and funny, and have started to be more crude and blatantly sexual (and males have taken over the bitching about their wife and kids routine, so the gender rolls have basically switched). In a lot of ways pure intelligence and wit is one of the last areas where female comics haven't ventured completely and I would love to see it happen.

Anyway, this was probably a lot more than you cared to know. But it is why I chose Tina Fey (and then  Amy Poehler, just thought she kind of made a good ditzier yet still intelligent side kick roll). Not that she would be perfect, but she's the closest I can think of that could take on that roll as a female comic. I want that pool to grow.

The difference is (for me, anyway) that working-class parents aren't able to motivate or enthuse a less-hardworking kid as well as are richer parents. They've got less time to devote from working long hours or in a tough environment; physically demanding or with a boss/customers who makes you feel like shit and also less money to offer the kid toys or holidays or bonuses for hard work; which is particularly apparent when there's kids in your class who get a new shiny gadget just for passing a test. I think for some that's a big de-motivator.

There's also the fact that if you're from a poorer background you probably live in a rougher area where there's all kinds of distractions from just education, drink drugs and sex at a younger age for example which to a hormonal teengaer are a big temptation.

This I can understand, and for this reason I think Sterling's challenge was ill-advised.

However, I don't think it's too problematic if it occurred in a normal game.  Yes, the studs are up on the leading foot, but that foot gets all ball and isn't directed at Valencia.  The trailing foot catches him but in my opinion, Sterling has won the ball cleanly at this point, and, too put it bluntly, Valencia was standing/jumping in the way.

Dont look at brochures or at their websites because ultimately they're businesses wanting to make themselves attractive to you the customer. All of those universities that you have mentioned are vastly different. The educational standard that you need to achieve to get in to them differs, alongside the standard of education received and the respect given to your degree when you are job hunting. Be under no illusion that all universities are the same in terms of quality and respect. Generally, and this is a massive generalisation, because there are courses at lesser universities that do operate in a niche and are hugely respected, you should be aiming for a university as high up the times list as possible for you. Someone I know transferred to my university and restarted their 3 year degree completely. I asked why and she replied ""I realised that a 3rd at ""my university"" was better and more respected than a high first at ""old university"""". You really don't want to be caught with a worthless degree! And she was talking about photography so hardly one of those feted degrees on reddit...

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; There are differences between the two which mean they need different campaigns. As FGM is illegal it's practiced mainly in back streets by dodgy drs or abroad so there are many associated health risks, hence the urgency.

Agreed. Male circumcision is bad, but I think as you say FGM is a newer threat and it's often practiced by people with absolutely no medical training. Obviously there's nothing medically justified about FGM (or male circumcision) but if a girl was to have this procedure performed on her by a trained professional her chances of sustaining health complications, infections and severe pain would no doubt decrease dramatically. Chopping off a baby boy's foreskin with an unsterilised instrument would cause complications too, but many times male circumcisions are carried out in hospitals.

FGM also has no real ""standard"". The severity of it can vary massively. Some girls have so much protective tissue cut off that sexual intercourse will cause her agony for the rest of her life. Sometimes only the tip of the clitoris is removed. Sometimes the whole thing (and that's about as close as you can get to cutting the entire penis off a boy). Sometimes the girl is even *sewn up* with only a small hole for urination. Maybe I'm biased because I am female, but to me that doesn't just sound invasive and painful, it sounds like actual full on torture.

Both genders need to be protected, but right now I'd say young female immigrant children in this country are at much higher danger. To my knowledge very few males in this country are circumcised. But I'm in a hurry and can't find a source on that so if someone else does that'll be great.

You've got to include the time it takes to get planning permission, that represents the real length of time between conception and generation.

[Ed Geater](https://www.facebook.com/edgeatermusic) - A singer songwriter who beatboxes too. Really cool, very different.

[Tempting Rosie](https://www.facebook.com/temptingrosie?ref=profile) - Reggae/Pop band.

[Benjamin Yellowitz](https://www.facebook.com/BenjaminYellowitz?ref=profile) - Singer songwriter. Think he's based in London now but originally from Birmingham. Really good voice.

[Jimmy Davis](https://www.facebook.com/jimmydavisdavis?ref=profile) - Brum based rapper. Meaningful lyrics centred around the world's injustices.

[Matthew Socci](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Matthew-Socci/342772735741836?ref=profile) - Contemporary classical guitarist. This guy has skills, really good player.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Indeed.  That the potential talent pool is much larger than most supposed meritocrats would suggest can be demonstrated by a simple thought experiment suggested by Michael Albert, the inventor of parecon (participatory economics), where he asks us to imagine a football stadium of surgeons at the turn of the last century and to ask ourselves how many women would be present back then as compared to today.  At that time, women would not only have been excluded from the talent pool, most would have internalised their own incapability of 'doing' surgery, believing it to be something for which they, as a gender, were incapable and unsuited.  A similar attitude and oversight is operating today in class terms, even more dramatically so if you consider it in global terms.

Edit:  As a rather important aside, consider how vastly wasteful this is, not only in terms of all those individuals who never reach their true potential and end up as disillusioned, bitter, rebellious people doing soulless, dead-end jobs with no real purpose beyond making someone else rich, but also in terms of society and humanity as a whole.

Insane.

Finally, to Lallana.

Our difference of opinion comes from how we're judging Lallana in comparison to Suarez and Torres. I'm judging these players based on their peaks, and how much they seem to be worth to the team they (do get/want to be/are rumored to be) transfered to.

Furthermore, legalising recreational cannabis might be perceived to be sending out a mixed message regarding smoking in general (something that they seem pretty intent on stomping out).

&gt; not much time is actually taken up dealing with it,

*""There about a million stop and searches carried out in England and Wales every year. Around half of those are focused on street possession of cannabis so there's a lot of time spent dealing with that very low level offence.""*

That's just stop and search. That doesn't include the hundreds of raids on ""cannabis factories"" they're always harping on about in the news, that doesn't include all the court time taken up for possession, distribution and production of cannabis, that also doesn't account for prison space and time taken up by those convicted of cannabis related crimes.

&gt; if anyone actually cared about police resources then they wouldn't have been cut by over 20%.

So with even less police resources, it's all the more important to focus limited resource on other crime (e.g. violent crime)

&gt;  for example the long term mental impact of canabis use

It's no worse that the long term mental impact of alcohol use. (See Professor David Nutt's work)

&gt; the effects it has on driving abilities,

States that legalise medical marijuana see reduce road fatalities:

http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/02/why-medical-marijuana-laws-reduce-traffic-deaths/

&gt; the links to organised crime (which proponents argue would vanish on legalisation) and human trafficking.

This all depends on how it's implemented. If the government were to legalise and tax the shit out of it, then there's going to be a black market for it. If the government legalises it and lets people grow their own and sell their own, then organised gangs can no longer profit from it.

&gt; I have an open mind, lets look at those places where legalisation has happened and evaluate stuff based off that.

If you really have as an open mind as you say, I really encourage you go out and look for some evidence to support your argument against legalisation. And then, do some critical thinking, and look for evidence to support the argument for legislation, and compare the 2. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

The second law applies on a large scale in a closed system, it doesn't preclude localised bumps like earth, where we can make use of the sun's energy.

Similarly human endeavour.  All human life, and business, is based on finding entropy gradients.  That is to say, using highly concentrated sources of energy to do work, and releasing waste heat in the process.  Once you've used that energy, it can't be used for anything else, which to me sounds like zero sum.  So while, in the short term, things have improved because we've managed to harness a MASSIVE entropy gradient in terms of fossil fuels, which ultimately represent stored reserves of solar energy.   However, in the long term the second law WILL win.  That's why it's a law.  Either when we use up all the high energy content fuels, or the sun burns out, or whenever.  

So yeah, short term in the last few hundred/thousand years or whatever things have improved, and our economic models are probably broadly valid within these constraints (mass amounts of easily accessible stored energy to do work).

Torres I think was and still is damaged goods mentally more so than physically. If he gets kicked in the face, or after he missed that sitter against City earlier in this season, he actually looked like the Torres of old so to say but then after a game or two it wears off which is the annoying thing about Torres. Seems he has a mental problem more than a physical one.

Sturridge wasn't given that many chances, he was excellent under AVB as a wide forward. I think the big mistake the club made and fans made instead of lambasting him for being selfish when he could have given goals to his team-mates. We probably should've just tried to stick it out with him and hope his decision making improved with time. Plus when he played with Torres even if he played the ball to Torres, there is no guarantee Torres would put it away sadly.

Almost all human technological breakthroughs have come in the last few hundred years, when we've had access to large energetic riches.  Once you start having to devote more energy to getting energy, then you have less spare energy left over to innovate and create technologies.  That's why you don't see much scientific research getting done during famines.

And as for changes in behaviour, globally consumption of basically every resource known has been increasing exponentially for some time now, and continues to do so.

And innovating?  The British industrial revolution was powered by digging coal out of the ground and burning it to produce heat and electricity.  China now consumes 50% of the worlds coal, and uses it to generate 2/3's of it's electricity.  Why?  Because it's still the cheapest and best way to produce electricity.

He makes a few mistakes but fights and runs a lot. He is pretty good on the ball but his passes can be a bit hit and miss. Sometimes he makes Gerrard-esque long, driven passes and other times he messes up simple short passes.

From the games I've seen he also sometimes makes the pass difficult for the receiver (hard into the feet instead of a proper weighted pass). He's also prone to giving away a lot of free kicks. 

He's a real fighter like Henderson and whenever he loses the ball, he will fight with all he got to win it back.

His versatility will be a huge plus and he will put some pressure on Flanno/Moreno/Enrique and Lucas/Coutinho in practice. 

He will fit in well with our quick attacking play style and it will be a huge plus with a midfielder who dares to drible past an opponent.

true,Yennzern,lfc68,,"A few points regarding Stadium redevelopment:

1. The plans include a phased expansion which could increase capacity to 54,000 in the first phase, and 58,000 in phase two.
      phase 1: adding 8300 seats to the main stand, current capacity is        12,237, new capacity will be 20,538. The second phase can expand the Anfield Road stand by approximately 4,786 seats. Recent capacity 9,074, expanded it will be 13,860.

2. The expansion of the Main Stand will give it three tiers, today it's a single tier. The exsisting lower tier will be kept operational during construction

3. Level 3, 4 and 5 will include new restaurants, lounges and bars for VIPs and premium seat holders. Level 3 and 5 will have glass frontage views into the ground.

4. The expanded Main Stand will be one of the largest single stands in the country.

5. The Hillsborough memorial will be relocated. The design has been developed in consultation with HFSG

6. The possible expansion of Anfield Road Stand in phase two will provide up to 3,000 seats for away fans in PL fixtures, and up to 8,500 (15% of capacity) for FA cup fixtures.

7. The shankly statue will be moved, creating a great opportunity for it to become a focal point of the new Fan Zone

8. Shankly and Paisley gates wil be incorporated in the new design.

9. The exsisting stadium within the gated walls is 8 acres. The total are with all planned facilities will be 17 acres after regeneration

1. There will be added 78 additional wheelchair seats in the Main Stand. 55 new wheelchair seats in the Anfield Road Stand.

The redevelopment plans also include massive regeneration in the surrounding area. It will have a great impact on the local community. It will make extend the influence of Stanley park, introduce a new pedestrian avenue. The surroundings will have parkland trees, lawns and planting, creating a green foil to the stadium. The plans are massive and i could go on for quite a while. But the various points i mentioned are some of the most significant.

But I think there's an animal-welfare argument to be made for some sort of license, even if it's free and you just have to register your dog in return for simple information about taking care of your animal.  

Far too many people have dogs that they shouldn't have, with no clue how to take care of them. So many of my work colleagues have dogs, even working dogs like collies, and just leave them at home alone from 9-5 then give them a 20 minute walk in the evening. It's no life for a dog that's meant to be working endless hours a day. 

Maybe making buying a dog a more formal process might stop some unsuitable owners? Maybe a license, with fines for not having one, might stop some of the cheap trade from puppy farms? 

It would be nice, but I think it's more likely everyone would just ignore it again.

On the way past Heathrow fields (we got rid of all airports within 2 years of BF coming to power as they only take you to dirty forgien places) I can see the hot air balloons that the RAF now use as target practise floating in in the distance. Naturally, they are all painted brown. Someone comes through the carriage with the food and drinks cart - the choices are Stout, Bitter, Carling and A packet of crisps. I go for the crisps as I mention i'm not really in the mood for a beer, and it instantly gets flagged with the Nationality Police. They are waiting for me as I get into B'Ham, obvious enough by thier skull facemasks and flag capes. I wonder what I have done to deserve being taken away, but quickly realise my faults are numerous - not wanting a beer, I didn't eat bacon the night before, I hadn't fully filled out my Inheritance Tax form yet (this is now based on how far back your family goes before you hit a forgiener, with longer meaning a lower tax band). 

When they take me to the ""investigaiton chamber"" (really a former Mosque, to terrify true English people) I find out my true crime - possesion of illegal contriband. I ask what it is - my clothes are made in New China (Hull), my phone is BT and all my other possions were sanctioned by the local council. They spit on my feet and I look down.

Italian Leather.




I wonder what my sentance will be - Hanging, Death by Pitbull or worst of the lot, 5 years forced service as an MEP.

It's really motivating when you realise that if you fuck up your exams you could really screw up your best chance to improve your life. As the great philosopher Jello Biafra said - ""You'll work harder with a gun in your back for a bowl of rice a day"".

Whereas the rich kids could go and 'work' for family or rely on family money to try many different careers etc.

3) is most interesting and will determine how well he progresses for us. His decision making can be quite suspect and styles himself as a more attacking player than he really is (thought khedira is an apt comparison). He hasn't yet developed a team awareness but merely compensates with his all-action style and full bloodedness. He's still young and I think Rodgers feels he can develop this.

true,RedScouse,lfc12,,"You compared their peaks. So that's not the point you were making. You specifically alluded to their career with us. ""Only when we look back at their careers can we say we got a good deal.""

Moreover, you can look at transfer prices for players like Torres and Suarez. David Silva, 25 million. Juan Mata, 23 million. Santi Cazorla, 16 million. The list goes on.

If you want someone English, look at James Milner. He had to perform well at Villa and Newcastle for years, and then he made PL TOTY with Villa to even justify his 20 million tag to a team that overpays for talent. He was slightly younger than Lallana too and had been a consistent performer in the Prem for years. And people still thought City overpaid for him. 

Players of that category are people who go for prices like that. Adam Lallana is not in that category after one good season in the Premier League. 

We aren't trying to give a subjective value of Lallana based upon how important he is to Southampton. By that logic, every time a club put a valuation on their player we would have to think that its correct. So Bale would be worth 80 million, Cavani is 60. Charlie Adam was Blackpool's most important player by and large, if they slapped a 15 million price tag on him, would he be worth it? Player price valuations are dependent on skill level of the player and how important the player is to them, for both buying and selling clubs. We are not clubs. We look at players and base our valuations off how good they are.

We are trying to make an absolute judgment as to whether he justifies a 25 million price tag compared to players with similar talent levels.

Today, whilst not every Eurosceptic Labour MP is from the left of the Labour Party, all of those who are considered most left wing - Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Dennis Skinner - are Eurosceptic.

Socialists to the left of mainstream politics almost all oppose the EU.

The parties that are pro-EU are all centrist or centre-right. The Greens, who I don't consider left-wing and certainly aren't socialist, oppose the single currency and want to reform the EU so it would be unrecognisable. Sinn Féin, on the centre-left, are the most Eurosceptic of the major Irish parties.

They will, for example, enable suppliers to modify the frequency and voltage or interrupt your supply for their convenience, to monitor your power consumtion at an incredibly granular level  and share data about your household devices (either through device-meter comms or through recognition of artifacts on the power ring) and patterns of use with third parties and lock you into a single supplier through incompatibility with other supplier's meters and high switching costs.

The amount of fossil fuels required to mine, fabricate and install that much solar is borderline insane.

Maybe a brain surgeon, due to the existence of the NHS, but very few fields have any sort of meritocracy going on and I'm afraid that as you get older you'll probably see more and more that it is down to *who you know* not *what you know*. I.e. An idiot with the right connections will go extremely far (hell, one became President of the USA last decade!) while a genius without connections will have very limited options. Education helps but there is simply no substitute for knowing the right people. 

If you know the right people, jobs will find you, promotions will come your way, and your salary will keep going up. If you don't know the right people, prepare to work late at the office hoping that one day the right people will notice you.

How do you meet the right people? You go to school with them at private schools. You play golf with them. You meet them at parties with other right people. This is where the class system comes into play. 

That's not to say that there's nothing you can do. I'm sure you can get  good education and a good job.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I think what you've got to consider is that the left anti-EU groups, and the right anti-EU groups are arguing from different angles. 

To probably oversimplify it, the left oppose the financial aspects of the EU. They don't like that it is essentially a trading block, they don't like that the EU can essentially force countries to sell of public owned stuff in order to make money to pay off debts (like what's happening in Greece, who have elected a left wing anti-EU party in the Euro elections). They don't necessarily oppose the social aspects of the EU, such as open borders, or wider cooperation with other countries. For example, TUSC support leaving the EU, and forging closer links with other socialist countries in Europe. 

The right oppose the social aspects of the EU. They don't like the open borders, or the centralisation, but they don't mind the financial bits as much, which is why none of the right anti-EU parties talk about the TTIP.

So when a party like UKIP claim that anti-EU sentiment isn't just a right-wing sentiment, they are twisting the truth, because the left and the right support different outcomes from leaving the EU, and only one could be satisfied.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"&gt;With the PL as it is you HAVE to spend big. The experiment has failed. You can't succeed without spending at least double what you suggest I would say

A quick look at transferleague.co.uk suggests this might not really be the case.

I took a look at Villa's net transfer spend since O'Neill left (and our big spending days pretty much ended), so that's four seasons of data.

Compared over the same period to other teams who were at a similar level to us at the time (i.e. Everton, Tottenham) ... we were the only ones without net profit. I ignored Man City for obvious reasons, though I think it's fair to say Everton and Tottenham have enjoyed a reasonable degree of success in the past four years.

I compared Villa's numbers to other teams pushing for or playing in Europe in recent years. (i.e. Newcastle, Liverpool). Newcastle made profit, Liverpool average ~25m over those four seasons and are now title contenders. So far it looks like /u/SecretApe is on to something.

Everyone knows Arsenal's net spend is awesome, so I won't even bother with them.

It would appear that Man Utd are the only team anywhere near a realistic place for Villa (pushing for Europa League) to aim at in the next couple of years who have a net spend of ~40m per year since 2010.

I think the best comparison for us right now is probably Southampton, though. Depending on how things go this year (since they only have two years of Premier League level spending to look at), you might be right. I doubt it though. If they sell their best players this summer, they can re-invest that cash and strengthen enough to maintain their upper mid-table/Europa League chasing status. If they don't, then they're still at the same level and don't need heavy investment. Basically, unless Southampton spend 30m net this summer (to take total over three years to ~105m, or ~35m per year), or dramatically decline on the pitch next season (i.e. relegation battle)... I'd say the numbers don't seem to support your theory.

What ***does*** support your theory though, is the notion that we need large amounts of squad restructuring. That would cost a lot. At least at first. But there's no reason why Villa can't splash out initially to build a foundation, and then maintain it with a low average spend in following years.",0,1401973575,null,0,false,0,chzrp5y,t3_276qoc,t1_chzrp5y,t1_chysr6g,null,1434104264,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

Either that, or a slight variation of that.

I wouldn't like to change us the current badge on the basis of the City Group in some marketing nonsense or other however. It'd have to be looking at it purely from a Manchester City perspective and our heritage and tradition. That said, a change which effects that positively in a roundabout way isn't a bad thing.

I like our current badge, but it's real downfall is the 3 stars. They represent nothing, they're decorative. No major European club has stars as part of their crest for decorative reasons, they all represent something; a milestone in titles, be they league or European.

And that's what we are now, a European powerhouse. The present badge was adopted when we were anything but.

There are many reasons to change it, but it has to be for the right ones. And fans, preferably season ticket holders, would have to be consulted.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"This is already happening in oil, and I say this as someone who works in the industry.

Conventional oil production peaked in 2005 and has been in decline since.  Since then overall production has been roughly maintained by making up the gap with shale oil, but at great financial cost.  By way of comparison, between 95-2005 the industry invested approx $1.5 trillion to increase production by about 10Mb/d.  In the period 2005-2015 the industry has invested $4.5 trillion to keep production levels constant.  At the moment we roughly need to find a new saudi arabia every 5 years or so just to keep production levels constant.  Given how disappointing recent plays in offshore Brazil and the Antarctic have proven to be, I am unconvinced we can meet this aim.  About the only places with much spare capacity are Iraq and Libya and maybe Saudi, but nobody really knows how much slack they can pick up.  Production levels have only been sustained by record high oil prices, and should prices drop we can expect shale production to slow fairly quickly.

Since China are outbidding everyone for the oil, and since there is not more to go around, everyone else is having to make do with less.  Less oil means less energy means less economy.  This is almost certainly the underlying cause of recent eurozone woes and political unrest in the middle east (investment bankers just add volatility to the market so they can better make money, they don't cause prices to rise by themselves).

I mean look, the cost of producing oil has been rising by about 10% annually since 2005, having been pretty much flat beforehand.  Compare the % annual growth in your food or energy bills in the same period and surprisingly you'll see they follow roughly the same trend.  We've not been feeling is quite as much due to quantitative easing keeping the lid on things, but it won't last forever.

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"Okay. I'm on a phone so ill do this as best I can.

A single pivot is the deepest lying player at the bottom of a midfield three. In a single pivot, there is one holding player who acts as the 'pivot' and the two more advanced midfielders usually roam with more freedom in front of him (not total freedom, as there is only one player between them and the back four) . The single pivot would be responsible for recycling possession, controlling the tempo of the game, breaking down opposition attacks etc. a single pivot would normally allow the more advanced midfielders freedom, but not to the extent of a complete number 10.

In a double pivot there are two holding players who sit side by side in front of the defence and usually one more advanced player sits in front of them. This advanced player would usually be a typical 'number 10' role with a very high amount of freedom , thanks to the two players behind him protecting the back four. The role of the number ten would generally be to create for the players in front of him and specifically - penetrate, with passes splitting fullbacks and centre backs. One of the two double pivots would usually have more of a defensive focus and one a creative, tempo focus eg. Lucas/gerrard respectively 

Imagine a single pivot as a triangle with its base facing the opposition and a double pivot being a triangle with its base facing our goal. 

Recently for example, stevie has played in a very very deep single pivot, controlling the tempo of the game and even creating from positions deeper than our centre halves. He's literally the perfect example of a deep lying holding midfielder.  

Has that helped? I can explain it much better at a keyboard later if you like?

&gt;The __voiced palato-alveolar affricate__, also described as __voiced domed postalveolar affricate__, is a type of [consonantal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant) sound, used in some [spoken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_communication) [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language). The sound is transcribed in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) with 〈d͡ʒ〉 (formerly the ligature 〈ʤ〉), or in [broad transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_transcription) 〈ɟ〉, and the equivalent [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) representation is 〈dZ〉. Alternatives commonly used in linguistic works, particularly in older or American literature, are 〈ǰ〉, 〈ǧ〉, 〈ǯ〉, and 〈dž〉. It is familiar to English speakers as the pronunciation of 〈j〉 in *__j__ump*.

Although I'm kind of averse to using other players transfer fees as a barometer of what someone else is worth (because a Bale at £77/85m or Luiz at £40/50m can blow the market right open) it probably is the easiest way to have these conversations, so let's continue to do so as you prefer.

I went back and price checked the following players so we know for sure what everyone's transfer price truly was.

*Apparently with all the add-ons Torres transfer was higher than we thought.

**Milner was £19.5m+Stephen Ireland valued at £8m

____

Torres (*£26m) Suarez (£22m) Silva (£28m) Mata (£23.5m) Cazorla (£18.5m)

You're essentially saying ""When compared to the ability of these players and the prices they went for, Adam Lallana is not worth the rumored £20-25m."" Right?

But... When we look at English players moving from English club to English club, usually mid table-ish teams into the top 6 we see...

Downing (£20m) Henderson (£16m) Phil Jones (£17m) Lescott (£24m) Milner (**£27.5m)

Lallana's rumored £20-25m (and my quoted £23m) seem more reasonable  now when compared to a different market, no?

There's an angle that shows more clearly what happened at 45 seconds into [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw_RJC_QNw)... the tackle was pretty awful.  Sterling touched the ball first, sure, but that's not the only indication of a fair challenge. He went in over the top of the ball and clear through Valencia's legs.  If Valencia's foot was planted on the ground (and you can see him trying his best to get evelation and avoid that at the last second) then it could well have been a broken leg or worse.  It was dangerous, and an especially stupid challenge to put in during a friendly match.  I don't think there was any malice in it, but certainly it was reckless and excessively dangerous.

I'd be utterly furious if someone came flying in on me like that in a meaningless fixture.  I wouldn't have tried to choke slam the person like Valencia did, I don't think it's ok to react like that at any point.

This and the fact that West Ham will be moving to a 50,000+ Olympic stadium and Spurs planning to move to a similarly sized stadium mean that Liverpool's expansion is even more important. 

Even though we are fortunate enough to generate some of the highest revenues from broadcast rights and commercial deals in the BPL, it has always been annoying that we've not been able to generate as much as our competitors in terms of match day revenue. The fact that we will be adding roughly 15,000 extra seats will clearly benefit us in keeping up with these other teams. However, it is the improvement and expansion of VIP boxes, lounges and bars that is probably the most important financially. Incomes are on average lower in Liverpool then for example London, so season ticket and general sale prices aren't as high as Arsenal's or Tottenham's. Instead a significant portion of revenue comes from wealthy individuals or businesses who purchase boxes and spend their money on the hospitality on offer. I remember reading in the outline for the expansion on Liverpool's website that the current kitchen and facilities for hospitality are a bit outdated at Anfield. Therefore the addition of more executive boxes, restaurants and places for those rich guys to spend money should see the most significant contribution to our financial competitiveness.

No, I don't mean to discredit the hard work that middle-class people do, it is hard for everybody. Having said that, working a nice middle-class job as a lawyer or in an office or IT, you are more likely to come out of that job not feeling like death, not physically exhausted, (although perhaps mentally), not being treated shit by your boss, actually having some self-respect and hope of a nice time when you get in.

When you work a shit job where you know its almost pointless and you're not motivated apart from to get the money, you get home and you just want to blank it all out.

And then in terms of enthusing your kids, nice middle-class parents can say 'try hard in school little Johnny, and you'll get a nice job like Daddy if you work hard'. If you're from a harsher upbringing where all the adults around you are perpetually angry at the world, tired, working long hours for little reward and often harking back 'schooldays are the best days of your life little Jenny, enjoy them while you can', little Jenny's probably going to do just that unless she's independently very motivated.

So **three times at CB for Barca**. If you look up the [09/10 season on transfermarkt](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/yaya-toure/leistungsdaten/spieler/13091/saison/2009), it will not show a single match where he played as a center back. Mostly DM/CM and AM once.


And Silva doesn't just drop deep, he actually rotates within a triangle. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXWq34XByjc) regarding the 433 with rotational movement (pretty much how we, City, Dortmund etc. plays). It's a really cool video and I think you'll appreciate it if you enjoy the tactical aspect of football.

David Silva sees a lot of the ball, but doesn't pass it around nearly as much as Yaya.

**Yaya had 2203/2424 passes this season**, while Silva only had 1627/1848 (according to squawka) (ofcourse not in the same amount of games, but it would be a bit too much to make a more in depth analysis of this matter :-)).

What about the people who buy them for companionship?  £500 is a lot of cash if you're an OAP wanting something other than the walls to talk to after the grand children have gone home for another week.

&gt;and don't realise how much they cost to feed and look after

Between £5 and £10 a week for food, and another £10/month for pet insurance.  Jabs are around £40 a year and some vets will do a 'lifetime' supply for ~£100.  Chipping is around £30 I believe, although some vets will offer it for free as a lead-in promotion.

The only other 'cost' is time, depending on the breed between 30 minutes and 2 hours a day 'walkies'. 

&gt;And finally, since every new dog would need a license, people would take breeding WAY more seriously. I guarantee that people will get their pets neutered if a litter of puppies is going to cost you £3000 to register and license.

All that does is hinder the above-board breeders.  Puppy farms and 'black market' breeders would rather run the risk of a fine than pay £3000 per litter.

What would help is free/cheap neutering.  A spayed/neutered dog is likely to have less health problems and be calmer overall.  I've no idea how you'd make it compulsory though.

This only happens to be cheapest due to the caprices of health and safety legislation requiring a crane to be used and a road to be closed - that doesn't make it right.

One frequently sees the opinion on Reddit that ""they can afford it, so it must be right"" but economists recognise that capitalism has [externalities](https://www.google.com/search?q=define:externalities). 

If the state passes a compulsory purchase order on your house or farm, so that we can build a motorway or a steel mine or frack for oil, we say ""well, I know it's your property, but this is an important resource that we need for the common good"".

Now you (and Ivashkin) seem to be saying that such perfectly good natural resources can be thrown away wastefully - the common good no longer matters - if a rich celebrity wants a basement swimming pool. Maybe you have the legal right to do that, but such waste seems irresponsible to me.

We're constantly told how rich foreign investors spend money and bring jobs here, but here we see householders who don't want to pay the cost of employing crane hire, and who don't want to pay the admin fees that Kensington and Chelsea Council charge to perform and inspection and close the road.

If you sell TVs then the [WEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_Directive) allows customers to return their old tellies to you - you have to accept this waste and dispose of it. If I set up a company importing TVs, I doubt if I'd be allowed to bury them in my garden to avoid paying fees at the local tip.

First off, there are two car parks you can pay for - the Sports Centre car park, and the Woolf Car Park. I don't recall the prices, but it's around £7-8 for the whole day.

On campus, you can very often get away with parking in parkwood. You do need a permit, and you can ticketed if you don't have one - however, it's not often that they check. They typically do a sweep once or twice a term, and then ignore it for the rest of the time.

in 2nd and third year, I used to park in parkwood, or in the sports annex car park pretty much every day without a permit, and the only ticket I ever got was when I foolishly parked in the sports center without a permit or a ticket.

Off campus, the best place is one of the roads [here](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=211216609578093656607.00049da4c26eda4bb58a0&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.294193,1.05384&amp;spn=0.002684,0.006539).

Now what is interesting is this figure of LCoE.

Are people seriously suggesting that we didn't already know that getting the wind to spin something, is cheaper than out bidding everyone else to buy some gas or coal?  The massive upfront cost of making a safe fission reactor.

The point, as always is that wind isn't always blowing.  The cost here is so cheap because it doesn't take into account the cost of getting the energy where it's needed, when it's needed.

This is just crap, from a presentation that is all about selling the company (which has a vested interest to shower lower than normal LCoE) picked by a bunch of eco *it's okay to tell lies if it fits our greater agenda* types.

It's normally a percentage, so it'd be more likely 1.2 million if the buyback clause was 12 million.

They cannot just go and sell the player if the clause is still in effect.

Bayern cannot attempt to invoke the buyback clause once the payment is made by Leverkusen, so they cannot just come along now and try to scupper the deal by offering the buyback money. It's whoever goes first.

Not to mention consumer protections...

I'm not saying the EU is perfect and that it gets everything right - it doesn't - some of their laws don't make sense - they are politicians and our own UK politicians are of the same breed and also perform in similar vain.

What I do believe is that collectively, European politicians are more in line with protecting the public, than UK politicians who tend to lean towards the American model of protecting private business.

We live in a closed bordered world for the most part; yet private enterprise is able to span the globe anyway.

Shutting down normal citizens/workers and denying them the ability to ""span"" the globe, means denying them the opportunity to go for a better paying job/life elsewhere - but does nothing to stop globalisation of commerce. The opposite needs to happen for us all to have a better lives - there's more chance of the EU politicians making that change (going by their record) than the UK politicians.

They're all just politicians in the end, whether they are voted in the UK or somewhere in Europe - there is still a politician making decisions about your country without your consultation.",1,1401984773,null,0,false,0,chzwik4,t3_27dhyb,t1_chzwik4,t1_chzvlsm,null,1434106600,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

You can't really go out and buy the superstar DM that Sandro could be, and if you take on someone cheaper, there is the chance it doesn't pan out.

Ultimately I see this depending on how the rest of our transfer business plays out.  If we were to sell Sandro, stick with Capoue as the starter, then we now have 65m to spend and that could put us in for 2 or 3 big names instead of 1 or 2.

TL;DR  Sell Sandro if it means Rodriguez, Lukaku, and Lovren are coming to Spurs.

Certainly his passing of the Great Reform Act set a very important precedent, that the voter franchise could be changed, but to claim that democracy resulted directly from the bill he passed is false. The franchise remained limited to with it being set at a universal £10 property qualification being needed to vote, or various values of rent which are more complex. This meant that voting pool remained very small, roughly 5% by some estimates, and only the middle and upper classes could vote. Indeed in some ways the bill was quite socially regressive, previously there had been no uniform franchise qualification and in some boroughs which used 'pot-boiler' or 'scot and lot' systems saw large numbers of working class men able to cast votes. The creation of a uniform franchise ended this. Furthermore the fact that there was no secret ballot meant that the gentry could still exercise massive control of the way their tenants voted which meant that in many rural boroughs MPs remained more or less appointed by the local landowners. Finally the fact that they refused to provide a salary for MPs meant that only the independently wealthy could enter parliament as no one else could sustain themselves which again meant that parliament remained very much under the gentry's thumb. Now all this said in the context of the time Grey's pushing through the Reform Bill was incredibly significant but we shouldn't distort what it meant.

There is NOTHING on that site that you can't find on any other site. His 'exclusives' are in every other paper and website under the sun, usually after others break stories first.

Just off the top of my head...

He allowed fans to pre-order his book for **years and years** without ever bringing a book out.

It's not as if a bunch of fans got together and thought ""hmm, let's pick on someone for no reason"". People don't like him for very justifiable reasons. Not least of which is the fact that he's a S*n supporter and apparently does not understand why the city of Liverpool is against that rag, despite evidence to the contrary.

During the World Cup in 1998 he was spotted wearing a hat with 'The S*n on it. Obviously, being the world cup, this happened in June/July. He got a lot of stick, obviously, from fans for wearing their logo on a hat and he responded by saying that he did not realise what that paper had said with regards to Hillsborough. He also had pictures of him in that hat on his site.

*Firstly*, that's ridiculous. Everyone knows what they said, and you'd think someone with 'inside knowledge' of Liverpool would know about it as well.

*Secondly*, in **May 1998**, he posted on a forum about why people should not buy the S*n, citing what they said about Hillsborough as the reason. So he says this, and then a month later he wears a hat adorning the same logo, and then tries to play it off as if he didn't realise.

I think with the size of our sub, that problem will have solved it self. I think we have enough voting power in the sub now to overcome the fact that the reddit algorithm weights time of post heavier than a post in the single digit negatives (I also think the algorithm has changed).

That being said, I think the transfer thread stalls a different problem now. Not everyone reddits at the same time or frequency. Just look back at last season. Every few days we had a post about the Lukaku/Courtois vs Cech/Lampard situation for next season, all with the same arguments. This happens because posts fall off the front page quickly and people rarely use the search function. The transfer thread should stop this as comments don't get weighted by time posted, so my opinion posted 3 days ago is just as visible in the thread as yours posted an hour ago. At least that is my hope for it.

My last point is about ""Submit them and users will up/downvote accordingly and comment as well."" To me it seems a bit hypocritical that this is coming up in a thread that is complaining about another thread. I'm speaking for myself only right now, and not the rest of the mods, but I am happy to let the sub do that. The problem ends up being that not everybody likes the same things.

The rumor thread was brought in 2ish season ago (I think, can't remember that far back clearly) because of a constant flow of crap rumors with click bait titles (I think this was around the first time Hulk to Chelsea was huge).

true,Mordisquitos,lancashire,Manchester,"To believe _""odds are it was done by a white guy""_ does not imply you believe _""non-whites are incapable of racism""_. Of course non-whites are capable of racism, but they do not believe in ""non-white"" supremacy. They believe in black, Indian, or Chinese supremacy. Actually, even these groups are heterogeneous. They probably believe in Dogon, Tamil or Han supremacy instead. 

Look at the content of the graffitti with a cold head. In a racist's mind there is their own race, which they consider superior, preferable, or worthy of privilege, and the rest. Why would a racist Black Caribbean, Indian or Chinese say _""whites not welcome""_ and not _""non-blacks/non-indians/non-chinese not welcome""_? Is this racist Indian implying he's OK with black people, for instance?

In other words, the whole rhetoric of classifying people into a ""white"" vs a homogeneous ""non-white"" group comes from white people, and the fact that this graffitti fits in so well with this narrative should raise an eyebrow. _""Whites not welcome""_ written with sincere racism (and not merely to stir up white racists) by someone not white would only make sense if the non-whites of Enfield where from a single ethnic group, which they are not.

Enfield is actually 61% white, according to [the 2011 census](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks201ew.xls), and the overall breakup is as follows:

|Ethnic group|Percentage|
|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------|
|White: English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British|40.5
|White: Irish|2.2
|White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller|0.1
|White: Other White|18.2
|Mixed/multiple ethnic group: White and Black Caribbean|1.6
|Mixed/multiple ethnic group: White and Black African|0.8
|Mixed/multiple ethnic group: White and Asian|1.3
|Mixed/multiple ethnic group: Other Mixed|1.8
|Asian/Asian British: Indian|3.7
|Asian/Asian British: Pakistani|0.8
|Asian/Asian British: Bangladeshi|1.8
|Asian/Asian British: Chinese|0.8
|Asian/Asian British: Other Asian|4
|Black/African/Caribbean/Black British: African|9
|Black/African/Caribbean/Black British: Caribbean|5.5
|Black/African/Caribbean/Black British: Other Black|2.6
|Other ethnic group: Arab|0.6
|Other ethnic group: Any other ethnic group|4.5

That makes Enfield 61% White, 17.1% Black, 6.3% Asian (Indian subcontinent), 5.5% Mixed, 4% ""Other Asian"", 0.8% Chinese, 0.6% Arab and 4.5% ""Other"".  ",0,1401987476,null,0,1401987779,0,chzxuz2,t3_27e0um,t1_chzxuz2,t1_chzwfpm,null,1434107233,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

So when I say ""managing a hospital, or even a section of a hospital, is like herding cats who are all simultaneously dying of a variety of incredibly similar diseases that none the less all react differently to each and every herding technique and treatment"", I say it from both experience and bias. But mostly experience.

Here's the thing. The NHS is both underfunded and held to higher standards compared to earlier years. And they weren't exactly ticking all the boxes then either.

It's an establishment that is, more than any other as far as I'm aware, reliant on people in every stage. Often people who are far from in peak mental health (illness and long shifts are both hugely detrimental, and every nurse around will have at least one take of a 24 hour shift in a place where a single bad call could always lead to severe contraindication or death) will have to make judgement calls, and all the management in the world can't prepare you for some of the British public.

Most of you will have worked a public service job at some point. Be it bar work, retail, waiting staff, we've all done it at some point.

Think of the worst type of customer. The argumental, deceitful, violent and/or just mentally unwell ones. Now imagine them in pain, agitated because they've not been allowed to get out of a bed for a week and surrounded by strangers who are in the same boat.

Now imagine trying to manage shifts around those people, or stocks of medication and medical supplies when you can't tell what extra you might need at any interval, or medication for a ward of 20 or so people who aren't sure what they're on, or might just be trying to get a higher dose of the fun stuff, or organising a full yard scrubdown while trying to avoid disrupting or waking the patients, and all that around regular stat checks, meal times and doctors rounds.

And then, after all that.... Remember that the person who has to do all that has a boss who has to regulate those sorts of decisions for a whole hospital, while keeping an increasingly shrinking budget in mind and having doctors on all sides decrying or praising a new medical procedure that will only cost a few million to implement over the next year.

Then multiply that by the number of hospitals.

Is it any wonder the board struggles? Don't get me wrong, some of them are absolute morons who couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery, but that just adds extra strain on the good ones who're again all just people.

Are you certain about that?

My understanding of what makes the Glasgow Effect so interesting is that even in the more affluent areas of the city itself you still see a significantly lower average life expectancy compared to more affluent areas in equivalent cities. Those in the more affluent areas of Glasgow still live noticeably longer on average than those in the poorer parts, but compared to other cities life expectancy is significantly curtailed even for the rich...

Yeah, there's all sorts of pretentious stuff up here - burger bars that won't take bookings and expect you to wait 90 minutes for a so-so experience (for that sort of wait, it should be better than good) but there's pretention in London, too.

I don't think anyone can miss anything in London really, other than having more disposable income, I just don't think it's worth it for the expense.

true,Galerath,null,null,"Ok let me clarify instead of making pithy comments.

I think there are multiple standards against which to justify actions or value things. For example, utility (i.e. how useful something is), morality (how 'good' something is). 

Money does not measure either of these things. In fact it's difficult to say what money measures because there are lots of interesting psychological phenomena at play like price anchoring. But let's go Marxist and say that it represents value in exchange as opposed to value in utility. I.e. something has a monetary value based on what you think you can exchange it for. This is a simplification IMHO but it works. 

In this case we're talking about mini diggers. Mini diggers have two values, value in utility and value in exchange, as well as a marginal value in exchange of their component parts. I don't think I'm making a large claim when I say that diggers do not have a moral value. 

Now, a digger stuck down a hole has 0 utility, so what's left to judge it on? Exchangeable value, aka ""money"" + potential utility after rescuing it. But the potential utility after rescuing it is pointless in a world where millions of these things are churned out every year - diggers are not a scarce resource, we can get another one. So we're back to money. Value of digger &lt; cost of extracting it = no point. 

If you think it's worth getting that digger out of the hole you need to justify that by appeal to morality or some other standard of value. So far your appeal seems to be that wasting resources = morally bad.

Now I agree that wasting resources *can* be morally bad, but only within certain parameters, for example, excessively large scale, or wasting resources necessary for life. So I think it's a greater problem that so much food is wasted than that say... industrial off cuts of metal are wasted. 

When we're talking about mini diggers, we're talking about objects made of really fairly few resources with no chance of causing environmental pollution (if the petrol, oil and coolant have been drained) . These don't meet, in my mind the criteria for worrying about wasting resources as they are neither necessary for life nor on a large scale.

However, we can go even further, let's say I do think that it's a *bad* waste of resources. But what can be done? We can spend *more* resources extracting those wasted resources... but that doesn't make sense, we're back at the same equation: resources saved &lt; resources spent = no point. 

So you have to then deny something about the resources used to extract it, i.e. that human labour isn't a relevant consideration or is not a relevant resource type. And that seems like a difficult argument to make when the moral value of the resources in the digger is already, frankly, pretty low by most measures. 

So what's left? Well you could appeal to different systems of morality. E.g. Kant's Categorical Imperative: act according to which you deem acceptable to become a general law. Is it universally acceptable to bury diggers? No. So according to deontological ethics, it's bad. Problem is: I think Kant is wrong, so that doesn't help convince me. The other major moral school is Utilitarianism, and my above arguments work in that framework. 

And now I've written more than I care to about diggers buried under expensive houses.

He's the best player on our team but I'm just disagreeing with the popular opinion around here that we'll be much worse off without him.  In Rodgers' system Suarez plays the vital role of as you said ""drawing at least 2 of the oppositions defense even when he doesn't have the ball"" or even play maker has his assists suggest.  But the whole point of that is that Rodgers' system gives him the freedom to play like that and I think that while we can't replace him with one player we could get two players who are better at both of those aspects separately.  For example, we could buy Reus and Benzema or Di Maria and Cavani, Di Maria could be an assist machine while Cavani could draw defenders away much like Suarez.  My point is that Rodgers is the key ingredient to our squad, not Suarez, Gerrard, Sturridge, or anyone else and I have enough faith in him that if we were given the kind of cash that Tottenham were able to splash then with Champions league football as a major draw we could be even better than we were with Suarez on the team, it's by all accounts possible.  The problem is that it's a huge gamble, and we're already so good with Suarez in the team that most of us feel like it's an unnecessary risk.  I don't want to sell Suarez either but we'll be fine without him if we decide to sell him.  Also, unfortunately that world cup situation could turn out either way.

&gt; Combining a mixture of power and poise, the versatile player is well versed in piloting the pace of games, especially when he is deployed in a deep midfield role. Can revels in box-to-box responsibilities, but has also performed effectively on the left as an attacker and full-back, as well as in central defence.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Yup. I think with Lamela one of his MASSIVE strengths is his creativity, technique and vision. He isn't just a ''cut inside on his left, dribble past x player and shoot'' over and over again type of a player.

This video v Villa shows just how dangerous he is down the centre. Admittedly you can see he spends a lot of time out on the Right but when he comes through the middle he's devastating. Potentially 2 assists and a goal, all from coming central. Bare in mind this is with a muscular injury and his first couple of months in England. Im firmly in the ''Erik will be devastating when he finds his fitness and groove'' next season. Especially with Poch - Italy is a LOT easier for Argentines to settle and Lamela strikes me as quite a reserved and shy kid surprisingly so needed this season to just integrate himself with the team &amp; England itself.

Was there a particular day (sometime in 2012?) when the rebels suddenly shape-shifted into the baddies?

This conflict is so much more complicated than that. There are literally hundreds of groups fighting in Syria. There are approximately 100,000 fighters opposing Assad. There have always been some secular fighters, some moderate fighters, and some extremist fighters - since the very beginning right up to the present. What has changed is that the Islamist extremists, affiliated with Al-Qaeda etc, have become much more powerful - because the moderate rebels haven't been armed. I am not making a case for arming anybody, it just frustrates me when people on the internet say we shouldn't arm the rebels *because* they're extremists.
