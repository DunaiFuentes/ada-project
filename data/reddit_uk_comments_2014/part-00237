Only for the most extreme circumstances, and used by people appropriately trained for it. The police forces being armed are in no way trained to be using that kind of equipment.

Then you've got the whole miss-use of force as seen in these riots/protests. They're assaulting protesters and press members, yet hardly doing anything about the rioters.

On the contrary, it's very oppressive. If it's not needed it shouldn't be being used.

Next time you send some money off to a charity in response to a mailshot, look for the 'campaign code' that will be printed somewhere on the response form. They use this to work out what got you to donate ... what text and images really get to you. For example, if you respond to a WWF mailshot about tigers, then future mailshots will be custom printed with a photo or picture of a tiger.

When your name and address gets entered into their systems, it is cross referenced against a database of postcodes to estimate what sort of area you live in. This is again used to target the mailshots. A poorer area might get a mailshot telling the tale of 'Jane' who killed herself because she had no job and couldn't feed her children. A more affluent area might get the tale of 'Jane' who killed herself because her business was failing and she had nobody to talk to.

true,A2-,null,null,"Ryanair require online check-in and printing your own boarding pass up to 28 days before, and certainly before you get to the airport.  Given that they are a low-cost airline and are known for charging rather a lot for on-board snacks it isn't unreasonable for other customers to bring their own and expect to be able to consume them.

There is no reference either way as to when this flight was booked by the parents of the allergic girl so I'm not saying this is a possibility, but if it was then this would have been an ideal way for them and Ryanair to have behaved.

If it was booked before the check-in period, and the parents had advised Ryanair of the potential for problems, then Ryanair could easily have inserted a ""tick to say you've read this"" box on check in, coupled with a large notice on the boarding pass (ideally in at least the language of the departure and destination points).  It doesn't happen, but should do.

I would be perfectly happy to comply with a requirement that I'm notified of in advance, or where the affected person is nearby.  However if I've spent several hours hanging around in an airport and bought snacks for the journey I'm suddenly told ""no, you can't consume them, and we're not going to do anything to replace them"" then I'm going to eat them.  It may seem harsh but everyone on that plane was there in a confined space where the options were limited, but with multiple opportunities where their boarding pass was produced or scanned in order to notify them.

An announcement at the start of a journey when there has been plenty of opportunity to notify those around about the potential for problems sounds rather like being the bare minimum with removing nuts from sale (given that the cabin crew's performance reviews depend on them taking a certain amount of money per trip) being a responsible move.  If this were a scheduled carrier with catered meals which on that sector happened to contain nuts then would they have allowed the girl to fly, or would they have refused to serve the meals expected as part of the ticket?
There are also various comments throughout the thread relating to the cleanliness of the aircraft where, again, if there had been prior notice there would have been a specially allocated seat where the area had been suitably cleansed whereas the average Ryanair flight is a 30 minute turn around with barely enough time to collect the rubbish and clean the toilet.  This might have all happened, but the article makes no reference to any effort on the part of the parents prior to boarding the plane.

This was rather longer than I intended.  I do not intend any harm to the girl, but equally her parents could have been more responsible at an earlier stage than described which may or may not (there is no evidence in any direction) include Ryanair.  If you have an allergy this severe then you should inform the carrier at the earliest possible opportunity (as soon as the tickets are being issued) and they can then carry out any necessary deep clean procedures and ensure that fellow passengers are aware of the details for that flight in advance, or can advise that they are unable to meet the standards required and therefore offer an unconditional refund.",0,1408057312,null,0,false,0,cjqi3in,t3_2diyix,t1_cjqi3in,t3_2diyix,null,1435240999,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I got A*BD in Economics, history (2 UMS off an A so I'm getting it remarked) and maths respectively. It's the D that is really fucking up everything. 

I'm still trying to find something through clearing but the courses I want to do (economics related) seem generally quite competitive and I'm sure that if I retook and reapplied I could get into a top university (I had offers originally from Bath, Southampton, Exeter and Sheffield) so I don't want to ""settle"" too much. 

If I'm going to resit the D...which is definitely a possibility, do I still have to declare it, and will it fuck up my chances for a top uni next year? 

Also how does it work if I do a different exam board? I switched schools at 16 but my old school seem fairly willing to take me back for a year and let me do maths AS and A2 in a single year, but they do a different exam board to the one I did this year. 
So on my application would I end up having 2 different maths grades (the D and a prediction)? 

Honestly I'm all a bit disorientated. I knew my grades weren't going to be amazing but I'm a bit disappointed about the B in history (I got an A last year and clearly was very close this year) and the D was worse than I thought too.

* Willian

* Gary Cahill

* César Azpilicueta

If any of those is a regular player for us by the time Terry leaves then they deserve the armband over him. My best bet in 2 years or so it would be Cahill, Azpi, Matic and maybe Luis who would be the biggest contenders.

true,AonSwift,null,Sir,"&gt; Well it's arm police that we trust or arm other countries that we don't trust. No matter what there's gonna be surplus, and it would cost too much to fund all of it in the military so we give it to our policemen who train with it and use it in dire circumstances, not on the regular.

The link above lad, have you looked at it? Do you know what this is all about? The problem is the police haven't been training with it.. They've been issued military-grade weaponry and equipment when they don't even possess the basic policing skills to deal with a protest/riot. And they've been using it in circumstances that couldn't be more opposite than dire.... They failed to use them at all during some of the riots which could be considered somewhat dire (although all you need are riot police with armed backup, which everyone has). Just because there's no where else for the weapons to go, does not mean you give it to your police force. They already have enough weapons and gear, with men and women appropriately trained to use so. What do you think the maintenance cost on all it will be? Or the extra time to train up regular officers to use such hardware? Salvaging any useful resources from the weapons/hardware may be too expensive for them to bother, but locking them up in a bunker somewhere is better than this.

From what I personally know so far, it's at the fault of head police figures, asking the government to issue them with this equipment and inappropriately conducting their units to engage civilians with lethal force. Like I said in another comment, it's believed politicians and high up people etc. want this chaos to happen. Crazy tinfoil hat talk, I know. But it is very plausible in today's world. 

&gt; but I'd rather see the weapons in the hands of the police than in the hands of terrorists, cartels, militants etc etc. 

Unless police and armed forces unite around the world and go full out oppression with the best hardware available, criminals and terrorists will always be able to obtain serious weaponry. And whatever the police get issued, they'll just get something bigger. That's reason police in Europe don't use guns. As soon as they did, criminals would start using automatic weapons. As soon as they start using body armour, the criminals start using armour-piercing rounds.

&gt; To me it's a good thing that the police get the equipment

As an engineer hoping to later enter defence, I want this more than anything. But in the form of better protection, surveillance etc. Not just giving every cop an assault rifle and full body armour. All that does is give them every opportunity to use it. ",0,1408060165,null,0,false,0,cjqjeoj,t3_2djzhk,t1_cjqjeoj,t1_cjqiaea,null,1435241806,9,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,9

He's 24 now, but he comes with very little experience for his age. Compare him to Moreno, for example. Moreno is 2 years younger, but has been starting for a club in a top league, and has won the Europa league to boot, and he is STILL a work in progress. For a defender getting that experience, learning to read the game and getting that confidence is huge and for me, Martin missed too much time in his formative years to ever realise his potential.

You only have to look at preseason, whenever he played and a winger ran at him he looked like he didn't have a clue what to do. On the ball, when he came under pressure it was a 50/50 whether he found the right ball or lost possession, and for a team at Liverpool's level, that isn't good enough. Yes it was only pre-season, but if you can't find composure in games that don't really matter, its a terrible omen for when the real thing comes around.

Still, always seemed like a good lad, well liked and never caused a fuss.

Hutton and Richardson as the wing-backs, both had decent pre-seasons and I think both can actually offer a good attacking option. In defence, Vlaar, Senedros and Okore. Good mix of pace, experience and strength. I reckon they'll be too strong for Bojan, but I still expect him to score one goal.

In midfield, Westwood, Delph and N'Zogbia. With the inclusion of N'Zogbia our midfield is already better. He's a good attacking option and let's hope that we get a free-kick or two because N'Zogbia has scored two already in pre-season.

In attack, I reckon Bent will start but alongside who? Weimann, maybe he's been alright in pre-season but Agbonlahor offers more pace.

Still, I'm excited for this season. If we sign Sanchez and get a player or two on loan then we should be in better shape. There is also a lot of pressure on Lambert, final year on his contract, hopefully he impresses because I want him to continue as manager, for stability reasons.

Stoke have bought really, really well. This will be a tough game, and I'd be happy with a point. The first week of Premier League football is usually really unpredictable so anything can happen.

Jonno, Skrtel, Toure, Cissokho:        2

Flanno, Skrtel, Toure, Cissokho:              4

-

Funnily enough, those two back 4 linups that had the most, most of them came towards the end of the season and during our run in towards the end, up until then we had a hell of a lot of change week to week. I think in the last ten weeks or so we only swapped sakho for agger once or twice.

God, the Toure, Skrtel, Agger, Sakho lineup was for our loss against southampton. :O

Obviously it's not the whole story, but changing the back four so much couldn't have had a positive effect. The added quality in depth is something i'm really looking forward to seeing, and i think Lovren is a great signing, but our defensive woes last year were not completely down to poor individuals in the defence. We were in bad shape. If Carra has stuck around for a season longer, i think we'd have won the league. Some of the points we dropped were when we had patchwork lineups.

Also, that wasn't counting substitutions, either. It was interesting actually, the city and chelsea games around christmas were on the back of a damn good few games with Jonno, Skrtel, Sakho and Flanno, 5-1, 4-1, 5-0, 3-1. Then we played Cissokho for the city game, and Sakho at left back for the Chelsea game. I remember us being fairly unlucky in both of those games, but you never know.

It's all a small part of the picture anyway, interesting to look at the trends though. I got it all from LFCHistory.net for the linups.

I'd be interested to see how stable City and Chelsea's defences were last season in comparison but i haven't got the patience :P I need sleep :D Haha

true,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,"I've had my hands full all day, and haven't had a chance to do much research on him. Unfortunately I don't watch much (any) French Ligue 2. So forgive me jf anything I say sounds ignorant.

I am a bit surprised by the price. I know he's lit it up at Metz and lead them to two straight promotions, scoring over 40 goals in the process. But Ligue 1 (which I do watch a bit of) is closer to Championship caliber outside of the top 3-4 teams, so it feels like an inflated fee for a Championship caliber player. I am worried we've agreed to it simply to avoid dealing with UEFA.

We need to get Maiga off the books. By my tally we have: Carroll, Valencia, Zarate, Cole, Vaz Te, Sakho, Maiga and a very promising Elliot Lee all vying for a forward position. That's a ton of money invested with only one normally played up top.

On the bright side, you have to be confident with that much firepower we will play more than one up top a lot of the time. Hell, even with Maiga off the books it would suggest we'd still play two (or 3 in a 4-3-3) up top at times. Which is exciting, and necessary.

I am hopeful. I still think we need to sell a striker and add an out-and-out winger. Or at least a midfielder who feels comfortable playing out wide.

I don't see any of the top teams having too hard of a time, except maybe us and Arsenal. We face a team that is more than motivated to beat us. I think we're lucky that we play them so early while they are still in a little disarray with a few of their signings just arriving. Arsenal, I think, may have a hard time with Crystal Palace. Palace were pretty good defensively last year and also managed to score goals on occasion. Unfortunately, I think Arsenal will get the 3 points.

The point made by Bloodworth has been made many times, but laid out here rather well and I think it bears another look in light of events in Iraq. It seems in recent crises our nation (from the proverbial man-on-the-street, to the chattering classes and their media, to the elite) simply can't do anything but sit around muttering about ""foreign wars"". 

Now Bloodworth is wrong to lump Salmond's admiring comments in with the others, he was more talking about a perceived reawakening of national pride; whether inflaming national pride is a praiseworthy thing per se is another matter (I suspect my wording gives away my feelings on that). 

Whatever the case, here is something on which right and left have a colossal blind spot. The same parts of the left which are so eager to condemn so much of Western involvement elsewhere in the world as imperialism or neocolonialism cannot find it in them to oppose the real thing. Some even end up apologists for a reactionary, expansionist strong-man. And the kippers, the ascendent wing of the right, whinge incessantly about undemocratic Eurocrats destroying their precious freedoms and flooding their shores with immigrants but see no issue with a corrupt authoritarian crony-state taking parts of its neighbors by force.

It would be easy to blame the Blairite/Neocon coalition for leaving us war-weary, but it would be insufficient. It is no new thing. One doesn't need to go back to Chamberlain. Look back to Major's response to the atrocities of Milosevic and his ilk in the Yugoslav wars. But I find myself and others wondering aloud - why now?

I had multiple job offers from midway through the year. In my opinion, this gave me increadible peace of mind and didn't detract too much from my work. In fact, overall, I think I was less stressed this way because it meant that a) I didn't need to worry that I was soon to be unemployed when 90% of my class would be employed and b) the offer for my dream job wasn't conditional on getting a 2-1, so I didn't have to be quite as worried about getting a 2-1. But for me, the idea of moving back with my parents is unthinkable.

Then again, a friend of mine who lived at home and commuted to uni didn't look for a single job before he graduated and I'm not sure if he even has yet. But his parents are happy for him to live at home and he likes it.

I guess what I'm getting at is that there are situational factors at play and I don't think there is a blanket answer as to whether or not you should or should not look for jobs in your final year.

We constantly talk about how he's one of the most prodigious players around, about how his stats compare with the best of them, how he deservedly should get starts over more senior players on merit alone, so why are we drawing the line at wages? He's been called out on his attitude issues before and he responded very well indeed, at this point it's basically a question of trust, in the management and the players around him, it will not get to his head, if there was any danger of that; this offer would not be served.

Put it this, the most dominant youth player Chelsea has fielded was kakuta. Destroyed teams by himself, but the team of that time was probably not as good as current team even if no player is as good as kakuta, stoch, pva because the quality is more consistent across the board and in depth. 

And dominance in youth level isn't everything because the qualities don't always carry across. Weiss and kakuta were the dominant players of that years fa cup but neither had the speed or strength to step up. Sturridge was also from that year and his pace carried over to the proper game so he didn't struggle nearly as much.

Of this year's group, the one with the best chance is boga. Of the rest many have games that transcend their physical styles so they could potentially step up, question marks are on feruz, rlc and solanke.

Here's a 20 goal per season striker from Gronigen, he's fucking magic, get in son."" That's what I want. Loaning players is hedging bets and we're better than that.

Even our amateur sports, ever try to buy tickets to a Final 4 game or an Iron Bowl? The problem, if you can call it that, is that sport is now a business first and a tradition second. TV money, sponsorship money, concessions contracts, it's all about money now. Nevermind if I want to take my son to Fenway to see the Sox play the Yanks or if I ever wanted to go to Anfield with my wife to show her my love of the club and of the game and to show her the best supporters in the world. It would be a serious financial undertaking, and to me, it's worth it if it doesn't cripple me.

The guys who mentioned supply and demand are right. It doesn't make it right and it damn sure doesn't make it fair though. Alas, it's the way it is and we have to deal with it I suppose.

This year alone I have fought off 9 sanction referrals that were passed on from my avanta advisor straight to the sanctions department of the jobcentre (which is none contactable unless you go through the job centre process, of which there is no set time which they have to get back to you by). On my 8th sanction fight, I went 5 weeks without any money, waiting for my mandatory reconsideration to be considered.

I ended up getting my local MP involved and it was resolved in less than 24 hours. 

My letters were being sent to other people, other peoples letters were being sent to myself. No amount of communication with Avanta rectified these errors, in fact they only enhanced them. I was accused of starting arguments when asking about what was happening, I even had my Advisor storm out on me whilst she told me ""You're stressing me out, I'm going to go and have a sit in the staff room until I calm down"". I had to sit at this womans desk for 20 minutes whilst her colleagues eyeballed me, if I left, I'd have been sanctioned.

They've fucked up again though, only this time in my favour. They stated that my course is now over. yet on speaking to my advisor at the job centre, Avanta have me until April 2015. My advisor at Avanta refused to hear about it though and so I had to stealthily record her saying in no uncertain terms that I am no longer with Avanta, because I absolutely know I'll have to fight this one in the near future.

I really don't know which option I would choose if I was in your position.

In theory, you could probably afford to temporarily skip Series 3-7 if you need to (only to watch them later, of course) because you can learn basically everything you need to know about the show from Series 1 and 2.  In addition, Series 8 introduces a new Doctor so you would be just as clueless as the rest of us if you elect to choose this option.  The only issues I see with this strategy is that you would have to get used to a new companion as well.

The other option is to carry on watching the show as you are and watching Series 8 when you naturally get to it.  There is no requirement saying you must watch all episodes when they are broadcast, although not doing so does admittedly make it easy for this website to spoil important plot elements for you.  This strategy of watching everything else first would also enable you to keep up with the Doctor's story, although frankly doing so is not terribly important when it comes to enjoying the show.

I recommend choosing one of the above options however, if you absolutely must have a short list of must-see episodes, I think it would look something like this:

Then, if you want to talk about this game, you comment as a reply to the top level comment. Poster can then edit comment to include teams/ref/stream/link to /r/soccer thread or whatever. 

Then have every game for that particular match day as a top level comment (posted by whoever starts the thread).

true,jonewer,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Thats fine in theory, but its simply not the case in practice. Juries convict on ""some argument about the guilt of the accused"" all the time.

Partly I know this from working in the criminal justice system for a decade, but its also abundantly clear from the Rolf Harris trial where a man was convicted on the basis of nothing but bald accusations of things that allegedly happened decades ago - with at least one of the accusers having received a five digit sum for selling their story to a newpaper, with another accuser not even able to say which year the alleged offence occured in, and in another, there being no evidence that the accused was even in the same country as the accuser at the time of the offence. And that's it. 

No physical evidence 
No DNA
No fingerprints 
No phone records 
No passport or immigration checks
No bank record checks
No photos 
No CCTV 
No corroborating statements from independent witnesses *what.so.ever*

So yes, we do put people in prison when we're unsure, mildly suspicious, or in the case of Rolf Harris, likely simply morally repelled by an inappropriate but legal relationship between an older male and a younger female.

So what I was referring to was a clearer definition of *no doubt* over and above the no doubt that we already (dont) have.

My real objection to the death penalty is not that it is impossible to absoluetly ascertain guilt in certain cases, but that it *is* impossible to ensure this continues to be the case, and that there is no legislative creep or abuse of the legislation.

A good example is of the above would be where ""trolls"" are subject to a police intervetion, and in some cases charged, for calling someone fat or ugly using legislation designed to prevent people's lives being made miserable by actual, serious, campaigns of abuse and intimidation, not to prevent people being midly offended by casual remarks.

Another, more sinister example, would be any one of numerous examples of counter-terrorist legislation being used to inappropriately sanction or persecute persons or other entities despite them obvioulsy not being terrorists in any way shape or form whatsoever, and the government not even maintaining a pretence that they are.

Now imagine such creep with the death penalty. 

In sum, my problem is not so much with the death penalty being applied in a few rare instances which are both particularly abhorent and  the identity of the transgressor obvious even to the dogs in the street (Lee Rigby case may be an example), but that the government will inevitably begin to abuse that power to murder people who are simply being a tad inconvenient, or that it will be applied to someone who does not fit the above categories but has been subject to a media hate campaign/moral outrage/manufactroversey and whom the public therefore wish to see punished.",0,1408087608,null,0,1408092732,0,cjqtyeg,t3_2dj31t,t1_cjqtyeg,t1_cjq3ms4,null,1435247372,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It stems mainly from the ""history"" of Arthur and Merlin like you suggested and also from the heterosexual nature of both Arthur and Merlin.

I realize that there's a minority of people in the world pre-disposed to a different way of thinking and understand some of them might want a romance between Arthur and Merlin that goes beyond the friendship that exists there.  However, to me, that desire is for a relationship that goes against the nature of the characters as depicted in the show.

It would be akin to me wanting an incestuous relationship between Gaius and Merlin because I'm pre-disposed to liking incest: it goes completely against the father-son relationship that is depicted between those two characters on-screen.

Now, if this were indeed a gay take on the legends of Arthur and Merlin, then I wouldn't mind it at all.  However, as it stands, it gets really annoying :-)

I happen to think the story of Arthur and Merlin's genuine friendship is a very powerful one - potentially even more powerful than the proposed romance between them.  I think it's fine to fantasize about alternate realities in non-canon fanfic but canon Merlin dictates a great friendship and nothing else.  Seeing it twisted by so many into a gay relationship makes it very difficult for me to connect with those fans.

Perhaps most subscribers to this sub are more interested in that non-existent romantic relationship between Arthur and Merlin; that would mean this isn't the right sub for me :-) and that's ok too :-)

TL;DR: I understand the gay viewpoint.  Arthur and Merlin are just friends.  Gaius is totally banging Merlin - I'd wish if I liked incest.

Now it's time to have a look at unis, don't just consider Scotland! Look down south as well, if you find somewhere that is the ideal for you you should consider it and don't let the fees scare you. I earn a decent wage these days and lost about $60 a month to Student Loan repayments, since it's come off since I started this job I don't even notice it. If you earn more you repay more and no one ever comes demanding you repay it all, if you haven't after 35 years it just vanishes. Pretty good deal! Do be aware of the differences between 3 and 4 year degrees one will suit you best and that may decide Scotland or England in itself as you can't do 4 years down south.

Your flair says Glasgow so get along to the [Glasgow Higher Education Convention](https://www.ucasevents.com/ucas/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=548965&amp;eventID=1161&amp;eventID=1161)  and talk to unis. Don't just grab prospectuses and leave the stand. Big unis get very busy, do wait and talk to them if you're interested in them. If you can, do some research in advance, don't be fooled by figures like whole University employment rates (what about my course and what sort of jobs do graduates actually get from it?) Look at league tables but don't look at an overall rank, look at a course rank and look at why a course is lower or higher, ask about that. Ask about anything else from the stuff above that you haven't been able to find out about in advance. 

Also find out what they want from you, that personal statement, do all the unis you're applying to want similar things? Great, if not you may want to consider cutting one loose (I'm looking at you Oxbridge and your not caring about extra-curricular nonsense...) 

Now you need to compose those 5 choices. You'll have your higher results so you can easily apply to one that is well within your results, that you'd be happy with but that might not be your first choice. Next up, where is the absolute dream? If it's a wee bit of a stretch on grades don't worry. Widening Participation contextual stuff (esp. in Scotland for Scottish students, nationalist governments don't set UK wide targets, not our choice) may mean you get a lower grade for reasons you won't know about until after you apply. The other three choices should be somewhere in between, on my form I put in a curveball choice of something I wasn't really looking at doing but it gave me a little more flexibility with my choices once offers were in. That's completely optional.

Any questions about applications let me know!",0,1408089140,null,0,false,0,cjquaiy,t3_2dinos,t1_cjquaiy,t1_cjqg2gr,null,1435247597,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Westminster ultimately holds responsiblity along with the old Stormont regime for the causation of the conflict when the government of the time refused to even discuss the issue of a sizeable portion of the states population not having full rights they were entitled to. If it had of intervened sooner and not started to incarcerate innocent people, we could even argue that the Provos might not have existed, as their existence was a direct consequence of Britain's failings to tell Stormont to knock it on the head - by the time it did, it was too late.

So yes. We *are* an exception to the rest of the UK. Not to mention that these cuts will have serious consequences for the entire UK for generations to come. Fuck the Tory cuts.

 Sterling and Sturridge overperforming in terms of goal conversion last season doesn't worry me too much, as I assume both will be key players this season and thus will have much, much more chances to convert, as Suarez took the limelight half the time.

It does worry me however that there is a lack of repeatability in the ratio of blocked shots as far as is known.

&gt; Reading wise I have almost (last 10 pages) finished Hiroshima by John Hersey and although it is obviously a bit grim, it's a fascinating read and I would definitely recommend it to you if you are at all interested in what happened to the people of Hiroshima after the bomb dropped. Once I've finished it I've got the entire Hitchikers collection by Douglas Adams to power through (sans the first one which I have already read)

I wouldn't mind reading that to be honest, I'm a massive WW2-nut when it comes to the societal and military stuff. My friends find my interest in the Nazi regime utterly mad, but that kind of stuff is fascinating from a clinical perspective. That being said, I always know where my towel is. 

Douglas Adams was a fantastic writer.

Ask them what sort of grade they'd be looking for and what other options you might have. 

I would get yourself a place through clearing first though, you can definitely get into some unis with those grades so talk to them. Get that place and you can cancel any time between now and September. It's a good fall back and means you aren't left with nothing at the end of this all. Alternatively drop clearing and start thinking about taking a year out, ask the unis you're talking to what else you can do that will help over that year out, get some experience somewhere if you can.

The change in exam boards I don't think anyone would care about, I would get your referee to write a wee thing explaining why you made that change so that no one could take it as a switch to a supposedly easier exam, it isn't so you're fine.

true,indigomm,uk,London,"I wish someone explained the NHS to me when I was growing up. I think there is a presumption that everyone understands it, so I don't think you are alone.

Your GP is really your primary point of contact with the NHS. Most of the time, when you have a problem you go to see your GP first. They can then prescribe you something, or may refer you to a specialist at a hospital. Your GP looks at the bigger picture of your health, where as a specialist of course generally is just consulting on their area of expertise.

I've found you GP wants to see you for almost everything. So he/she will want to see you the first time they prescribe something, but also when you get test results back etc. A lot of the time I've seen a GP the appointment has been literally a couple of minutes long.

Obviously if it's an emergency, you go to A&amp;E and skip your GP. You may get prescribed something by the hospital for immediate use, but they will generally refer you back to your GP for prescription renewals and longer-term care. I'm not sure how you skipped your GP - sounds like you managed to see a specialist or doctor who has made a recommendation but thinks your GP should make the final call. You may still need to go see a specialist occasionally (I do every year for monitoring), but the rest of the time you deal with your GP.

If you need a prescription renewed, you don't need to see the GP. You ask your GP to renew it, and they leave the paperwork on reception at their office which you take to the pharmacy to fulfil. You can put a request in electronically and collect yourself, or collect from the pharmacy. Best of all, some online pharmacies will handle it all for you. I use [Rowlands Pharmacy](http://www.rowlandspharmacy.co.uk/) who are reputable but also deliver for free (most will charge for delivery). Took me a bit to get it setup as their online system isn't great and I had to request it twice, but obviously it's a lot more convenient in the long term.

Good luck anyway. We're lucky enough to have a decent health system, but for some reason nobody tells us how we should use it!

The harrass-marketing was terrible. You know, photos of poor kids with no parents, no goats, and flies in their eyes, kind of thing.

Most of the mail was written in really spidery, shaky writing, by people with pre-1930 dates of birth. The charity was guilt-tripping money from pensioners who could probably ill-afford the donations.

There was a ""do not mail"" flag on the software for each ""supporter"" but we'd constantly have people phoning in to complain that they, or their elderly and vulnerable relatives, were still receiving unwanted mail even with the DNM flag checked.

My grandfather mentioned the same thing to me so I checked the DNM on his record.

After he died, we moved into his house as house-sitters while the probate went through. Each week, a shed-load of charity marketing stuff would arrive on the door mat, including from Save the Children. No surprise there.

There is nothing wrong with being critical of Gerrard where it's due, he does have faults, but any positional weakness is less evident in a 3 man midfield and he has adapted well to the responsibilities of his new deeper role

true,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,"Weeeelllll..... the hand-wringing is certainly nothing new. War-weariness among the west has been evident since 1945 with the vast majority of conflicts really only serving to protect particular overseas interests, not Johnny Foreigner.

OK, I know I sound like some paranoid pacifist anti-globalisation nut here, but the wars that the UK has been involved with since WW2 have all served a particular British interest, from Suez up until Iraq and Afghanistan: either keeping our precious resources or getting hold of more. Perhaps the only exception to this is the Falklands, but Saint Maggie wanted her own little vote-winner rather than pandering to the business lobbyists.

Oops. There's the word. Lobbyists. The major conflicts that we've been involved with have been brought about by the governments reacting to the businesses that are lobbying them to take action. Hence the public's hand-wringing: ""Why didn't we intervene in X, considering we did in Y?""

It's only now, when we see that IS are posing more of a threat to our business interests, that we are arming the Kurds. And we're doing so under the title of ""resistance."" We didn't really help the Kurds when they were being slaughtered by Saddam Hussein, we just wagged our fingers a bit. Why now, though?

Putin is more than a mere sabre-rattler, sure. But for all his aggression he's not really threatening any stakes we have in the former USSR... yet. That, and the systematic dismantling of the armed forces just means that our government can only talk about sanctions while the public grimace uncertainly. But don't forget the massive investment in the UK by various Russian, erm, ""businessmen"". You can bet that they've hired lobbyists of their own too.

So why do we, the public, take so little action? Most likely because we have so little information about what's out there. Maybe we're all too keen to pursue an isolationist or neutral approach. I live in Sweden at the moment, and it's all too easy to see the same attitudes here. Some people will get together in the city and wave placards, sure, but most people look away. With Putin's aggression they sat up and took notice briefly, but only because there was a suggestion that he was going to turn his attention to the Baltic. Now that he's facing the other way, so are the Swedes.

Chamberlain's own faults were at least balanced by Churchill's doomsaying, and the latter turned out to be right. There is nobody in a position of power to assume the Churchill role and assume the moral high ground. Instead people resign from the government in a fit of righteous indignation, and often for the wrong reasons. If Baroness Warsi really felt that strongly about our policies in the middle east she would have quit a long time ago. If she really wanted to show solidarity with Palestinian Muslims then why didn't she speak up sooner? And as for Robin Cook: he was fine selling arms to Iraq on our behalf until 9/11, then when war broke out he had a sudden crisis of conscience and quit.

I agree with you: in the modern world it should be up to the developed, prosperous nations to protect the people that need it. Instead those nations merely look to protect their assets, and leave the victims to their plight. In the modern world it seems there is no place for modern values or morals.",0,1408096062,null,0,false,0,cjqvlkw,t3_2dlk7d,t1_cjqvlkw,t1_cjqo3ka,null,1435248369,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

The charity commission are more than just a registry, if you have a problem you can complain. Nor will an organisation survive just because they are registered, tens of thousands of charities collapse every year because they can't generate enough funds.

Yes and no. There are advantages to scale whereby they can become more efficient than a smaller organisation. You won't find a more efficient fundraising charity than Charity:Water, for example, as they have all of their costs covered by large donors, and they're huge.

This is the thing, none of those women would've consented to those relationships if they knew what was actually going on. To me, that is t least a form of rape. Some kind of weird complicated rape, but then human sexual relations are very complex.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt;  Alex Salmond and Nigel Farage, both leaders of burgeoning nationalist parties (Scottish and English respectively), have named the butcher of Chechnya as the one politician they “most admire,”

Oh jesus fucking christ. Besides trying to claim that both ""nationalist"" movements are even remotely similar, here's the original interview quote they are butchering:

&gt; &gt; In his GQ interview, Campbell sought to establish Salmond's view of the Russian president by asking: ""Putin?."" Salmond replied: ""Well, I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but he is more effective than the press he gets and you can see why he carries support in Russia.""

&gt; &gt; ""Admire him?‚"" asked Campbell. Salmond replied: ""Certain aspects. There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the intermesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire. He's restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing. Russians are fantastic people, incidentally; they are lovely people.""

And that becomes a quoted ""most admire""? No wonder the US media has zero credibility. 

&gt; According to a recent video put out by the group, the main problem in “the Ukraine” (as they revealingly call it) is not Russian-backed separatists but rather “E.U. meddling.”

Well, it fucking well is. No one was dying until the violent [EU/US backed coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy#Ukraine.2C_Georgia.2C_Serbia.2C_Slovakia) and [expansion of NATO onto Russia's borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_expansion). They are the ones on the defensive, not offence. 

The incredible thing is that while our press were going mental at the ""attack"" on their protest camp they were covering our ""clearing"" of our own ""occupy"" camps in completely different terms despite the same levels of force being used! I missed the call to arms saying it was ok overthrow the entire government over it. 

&gt;  Using fabricated quotes from alleged victims of “Ukrainian Nazis” pulled from Facebook pages that later vanished, Pilger blamed the entire crisis on “Washington’s planned seizure of Russia’s historic, legitimate, warm-water naval base in Crimea.”

And again with the ""not Nazis"" claim. [Svoboda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_%28political_party%29) are self-described neo-nazis who carry nazi emblems, have nazi beliefs, carry out nazi policy and attacks and routinely perform nazi salutes on camera. 

Our press had no issue labelling them neo-nazis when it suited the fear-mongering rhetoric [in the leadup to the Euro '12 tournament](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4284461/The-Sun-investigates-anarchy-in-Ukraine-Euro-2012-hate-camps.html).

Q1) United may grab a domestic cup but I can't see them winning the league.

Q2) I like RVP, such a fantastic finisher and can score some incredible goals.  I dislike Ashley Young, although a good player I just feel his attitude stinks.  Hopefully he will sort that out this year.

Q3) I'm not happy that Michu has gone but if he was going to cause issues in the dressing room then it's for the best.  The rest of the spaniards weren't consistent enough for my liking and causing dramas so it's best they have gone.  Excited about Gomis and happy Siggy is back, hopefully he can replicate the form he was in last time he was with us.  As for United, well as others have mentioned Herrera looks like the midfielder united have been crying out for. 

Q4) I think Van Gaal is a much better choice than Moyes.  Whether or not he can get that ramshackle defence sorted this season is another matter.

The problem here is too complex to easily resolve it by simply killing that person. Also, how about we finally become a society where death of a person is something which needs to be avoided at every opportunity?

I also doubt that spending your time in prison is of any kind of comfort. In fact, I would like seeing more programmes which would ask prisoners to actually work there, hence bring something back to society. Not forced labour though, we shouldn't be North Korea. Prisoners would get treats for working (and I think such is already happening but maybe it's scale should be even bigger).

Some people form a long relationship with a specific charity, and will be classed as a premium supporter. They are unlikely to sell these details on for the reasons you mention. However, the majority of people will set up a direct debit and forget about it. They are unlikely to cancel it (unless they feel the charity is harassing them), but at the same time, feel that they are already ""doing their bit"", and ignore any further requests for donations. 

Once a charity has mailshotted you a couple of times with no response, they might decide that you are giving as much as you are going to give, and any further mailshots are going to be a waste of money for them. At that point, they might decide the best way to capitalise on you is to sell your details.

It's all about maximising the amount of money they take. By selling on the data to other charities, they might stand to lose 0.1% of their donations, but the revenue brought in by selling the list (multiple times) will be greater.

I'm not sure that your example works but maybe I'm just misunderstanding it. Regular donations are the most efficient form of fundraising going and these people are highly valued, premium supporters as you say. If they don't reply to further requests for support it still doesn't make much sense to sell their details (data protection issues aside) as the charity will continue to make a consistent profit on the relationship. If they're making at least £40 a year there is not much return in selling off the details for less than a tenner, to a rival fundraiser no less, and jeopardizing that super efficient income. 

I'm sure it happens, especially when you are talking about professional fundraising associations rather than charities, but that tactic is not widely used when charities manage it themselves, at least in my experience.

We don't. But neither do they in Russia. 

I have a massive pet peeve with people confusing _authoritarianism_ with _totalitarianism_. A totalitarian regime is one in which public and private life is subjugated to the needs of the State, usually within the context of an official State ideology. An authoritarian one is one where blind obedience is expected or coerced out of the population by the government, there is usually little or restricted political pluralism, and there is no real separation of powers.

There's the theme of the military and the perception different people have of it that comes back and that I find welcoming in regard to current events. (Soldiers returning from Irak/Afghanistan, ptsd, different feelings surrounding the military in regards to various wars)

We first see it through Dany Pink who struggles with both what he did as a soldier, kids asking dumb questions about war and the fear that regular people will see him as a murderer. (He clearly has a bad opinion of himself because of it).

On the other hand, we have the doctor who tends to see the soldiers around him as just that and Clara who sees the people first. The same attitude is mirrored in the Dalek. The Doctor just sees his enemy, Clara sees an individual with a conscience. It does mirror Eccleston's ""Dalek"" story a bit, in fact I was a bit surprised this story wasn't referenced. The Doctor has seen a dalek become ""good"" in the past. Maybe he just didn't want to remember it. 

Overall, a pretty strong episode. Capaldi is definitely a great doctor and I like his more conflicted relationship with Clara better then the ""best pal"" Smith's Doctor had with her. 

Also, am I the only one a bit worried it won't be as good with music and special effects? Moffat tends to overdo it and bloat his episodes with dramatic music and heavy special effects.

Hang on. You claimed Three was 'just as cheap if not cheaper' - now you're saying it's more expensive?

&gt;As for coverage, it's well understood that 3 and EE have the highest level of 3g coverage on a national basis, and o2 are several percent lower.

Again, hang on. *I* didn't make any claims about Three's coverage. *You* claimed there was no 3G coverage on GiffGaff, which is blatantly horseshit. As stated - I've got 4G as standard. That said I've never had a problem streaming Netflix on the 3G either - I did it for a month after moving into my new place and not having a fixed line and before 4G was activated.

Never said it does, you fucking helmet. I've said, several times, that it runs because of the supporters. Go back and re-read the thread. Even with your rudimentary English you should be able to pick that out. 

Are you really unable to comprehend that extremely simple concept?

&gt;Don't delude yourself, wet lips.

Don't have a clue what that means. If it's supposed to be an insult, try harder because it's silly.

&gt;If sarcasm is bellendery to your crazy self, you need help.

Don't have a clue what that means.

&gt;Who taught me English, thankfully not a foul mouthed tit like you.

Don't have a clue what that means.

&gt;Yeah, keep trying the old I can go to the ground nana trick. That's why I said, you're place is at RAWK.

""Take me seriously! Take me seriously! The other people at RAWK are mean to me too!"" (Because you're a rude, abrasive cunt. Not because you don't go to the game - just FYI)

&gt;The irony of you trying to say that I'm calling myself a proper supporter while you waffle on about going the game, practically running the club and keeping us going single handedly is delicious.

I don't think you're using the right words there. I'm calling you a cunt because you're acting like one. You're trying to get taken seriously as a supporter because you buy a shirt every now and then, but you're overlooking the obvious point: you're rude and unpleasant to fellow fans and supporters and you think you know it all. *That's* why no one will take you seriously. *That's* why you're not a proper supporter.

Nowhere have I said that **I** am single-handedly responsible for running the club. I've said supporters are. It's not my fault that you aren't intelligent enough to understand that. 

Brush up on your English skills and take it on board when people tell you you're being rude, then you might move forward.

&gt;Man, I don't see Fucking cunts like you anywhere

I'd imagine you don't see cunts at all, with an attitude like yours.

&gt;...you're quite the bar in terms of how deluded someone can be.

Here we go again. You don't understand English. You resorted briskly to Reductio ad absurdum and you're now repeating yourself like a fucking idiot.

&gt;Haha for sure, any local I meet if I do, will be able to take some sarcasm and not be a cunt flap like you. 100%.

Trying to play off rudeness as sarcasm, after it has been pointed out that you're impolite and unpleasant, isn't a fall back position that will work when there's a wall of your bad attitude for people to read back through.

If you spoke to people like you speak to people on here, you'd get a fucking dig - if you were lucky.

Now, do yourself a favour and fuck off. Improve your English skills and realise that just calling yourself a 'supporter' isn't enough. You have to fucking act like one as well.

true,billy-hoyle,null,null,"Nice list, but I think there's some other books which I **strongly** recommend you getting your hands on:

[Blue moon: Down among the dead men by Mark Hodkinson](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Moon-Football-Manchester-Mainstream/dp/1840182075) - An absolutely excellent account of our season in division 2 from a journalist who was asked to cover City that season. Shows just how messed up the club really was at that point, and if I remember rightly it contains a few interviews from people within the club as well.

[Meredith to Mercer and the FA Cup by Eric Clayton](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Manchester-City-Meredith-Mercer-F-A/dp/B001KX2IZ6) - An absolutely surreal book, all about the history of city until the book was published (late 60's I think). This was one my Dad had as a kid and then dug out the loft for me when I was young and simultaneously getting into City and reading. Discusses events that you probably won't have read anywhere else ('recent events' for this book was the 1940's/50's). If I remember rightly the back 20 pages or so are filled with all the data on our seasons and cup runs, as a little kid who for some reason loved stats that was an absolute heaven. An absolute eye-opener into the true history of city.

3 autobiographies which are absolute must owns:

[Please May I Have My Football Back: My Life at Manchester City by Eric Alexander](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Please-May-Have-Football-Back/dp/1848185081) - the Alexander family had been involved with City from pretty much the point of its existence until they sold it to Peter (fucking) Swales. An absolutely stellar account of the clubs history.

[Maine Man: The Tony Book Story by Tony Book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Maine-Man-Tony-Book-Story/dp/184018812X) - Tony Book is an absolute legend, signed for us 60's as a (relatively) old footballer and went on to win us the FA cup. Stayed on with the club after retirement and had a couple of spells of managing us (as recently as the early 90's IIRC). Hero

[This Simple Game: The Footballing Life of Ken Barnes by the obvious](http://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Simple-Game-Footballing-Barnes/dp/1901746496) A superb account of what growing up as a footballer in the 40s and 50s was like, as well as a great discussion on our mid 50s triumphs and squad. Ken then went on to be city's scout (I think he was the one that screwed over by the Giggs deal) whilst his son played for City. Yet another fantastic book.


edit: Just seen you have Eric Alexanders book in your list (must have missed it the first time round), but I couldn't recommend the other 4 more than enough. (Also, I'd recommend reading Andy Morrisons autobiography as it's amazing - not so much about City but the guy has had a mental life. Also avoid Colin Bells and Shaun Goaters autobiographies at all costs - they've hardly led the most exciting lives.)",0,1408104737,null,0,false,0,cjqxc8v,t3_2dlaad,t1_cjqxc8v,t3_2dlaad,null,1435249290,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

The coverage issue is not ""horseshit"". I did not say that you don't get access to 3g on Giffgaff, I said the coverage is crap, just as crap as o2 customers experience.

This is a coverage level that 3 and EE claim to have met in 2010. http://gr.nsn.com/nn/news-events/press-room/press-releases/t-mobile-and-3-uk-build-europe-s-largest-shared-3g-network

At one point, o2 were told off by ofcom for not meeting the coverage obligations of their licence. This is something that only o2 have been subjected to, every other network has consistently met or exceeded theirs. http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/Ofcom-Slams-O2-3G-Coverage

You mention 4g on Giffgaff. Is this the Giffgaff where you have to pay for a special 4g goodybag and lose unlimited data? No such problem on 3.

By being able to stream Netflix, I was referring to how I was getting a nice HSPA signal whereas the people I see with O2 are stuck with GPRS, or edge if they are lucky. Adding Giffgaff into the mix seems to make it worse, as they refuse to pay for much needed Interconnect bandwidth into O2's network.

**TL:DR** **No moves for Benzema, Cavani, Reus, Volland, Falcao, move for Bony unlikely. Assaidi and Borini moves in the hands of the players. A goalkeeper will only be bought if the right target is found, no move for Romero. Suso to be offered new contract, unsure of future. 4 or 5 players to be loaned out depending on what happens with Agger. Lovren, Skrtel and Manquillo expected to start on Sunday, Sakho to fight for starting place. Moreno deal held up by paperwork, expected to be signed up today, won't play Sunday though. Pearce expects LFC to finish top 4. Brandao unsure about whether to send Ibe on loan or keep close to the first team**    

* **Is Rodgers planning to turn Sterling a centre forward after him having delays to replace Suarez?**

Not that I know of but it could be an option for him. Sterling has shown his versatility with how he has adjusted to being played as a No 10. He's as good there as he is out wide.

* **Do you think that in the next 12 months Jordon Ibe can reach the same heights as Raheem Sterling has in the last 12?**

It's a big ask to follow in Sterling's footsteps considering the impact he has made in the past 12 months but there is no doubt that Ibe has all the tools.

I was really impressed with him over in the States. Milan couldn't handle his pace and strength and resorted to kicking lumps out of him. Ibe handled it all brilliantly and has a great temperament.

Dilemma for Rodgers is whether to keep him as an impact sub to come off bench or send him out on loan so he plays every week and really kicks on. At 18, he's still raw and needs to play.

* **What's the situation with Suso? Has he impressed enough in pre-season to be the squad this year?**

I know LFC have been in talks with him over a new contract so they certainly aren't planning on selling him this summer. Difficult to see him forcing his way into the team with current competition for places so maybe another loan spell will follow.

* **What's happening r.e. Borini? Is the move to Sunderland still on, if so when do you expect it to go through?**

Liverpool still very happy to take the £14m Sunderland have offered but Borini still stalling over move. He knows Rodgers is going to bring in another striker and that he could find himself fourth choice if he stays. Ball is in the player's court. Depends whether he wants to play regularly at Sunderland or risk spending the season on the periphery at Anfield.

* **Is there genuine interest in Kevin Volland of Hoffenheim?**

Not that I know of.

* **Lovren/Sakho Lovren/Skrtle or Lovren/Agger Who do you expect to be BR preferred CB Partnership?**

Lovren and Skrtel will certainly start the season. Sakho will have to fight his way back in.

* **Is LFC still pursuing Icardi?**

I'm not aware of any interest in him.

* **Is it true that LFC have enquired for Falcao, Benzema AND Cavani? And that we ran into dead ends in all three cases?**

LFC have certainly aimed high with enquiries for all three of those players you mentioned but they were told none of them were available.

The problem at this stage is that there isn't a great deal of choice left. Rodgers won't just spend for the sake of it and could even wait until January if the right deal can't be done.

Samuel Eto'o would be an absolute last resort and I'd be surprised if that one happened. The club are currently looking at other options. Bony continues to be linked but LFC aren't planning on going back in for him. 


* **Do you see liverpool cementing a place in the top four this season?**

Yes. Chelsea are favourites for the title and rightly so as I think Costa will prove to be a great signing for them.

Man City also look very strong but I'm confident Liverpool will be camped inside the top four.

That has to be the main target and hopefully winning one of the domestic Cups and reaching knockout stages of the Champions League.

Of course they will miss Suarez but Rodgers has bought well and the squad is so much stronger than 12 months ago.


* **Will all of Manquillo, Moreno and Lovren start for Sundays game?**

I would expect Manquillo to start at right-back after his impressive debut against Dortmund and obviously Lovren will line up alongside Skrtel. But the paperwork for the Moreno deal hasn't been registered in time for Sunday's game. He probably wouldn't have played anyway considering he's only just arrived.



* **Any truth in this Romero link? You did mention earlier in the window that we were looking for another keeper.**

If the right one can be found Rodgers will sign another keeper before the window shuts but I'm not aware of any interest in Romero.



* **Moreno announcement?**

LFC still waiting for the green light in terms of paperwork as there's been a slight delay from Sevilla's end. It should still be announced this afternoon. But he won't feature against Saints on Sunday.  




* **Is it true that we have bid for Wilfried bony today and what is the current situation of Reus linking him to LFC?**

No, there is no truth in LFC bidding for Bony today. I can't see Liverpool going back in for him. As for Reus, despite the continuous Twitter rumours, LFC have never shown any interest in making a move for him this summer.




* **Are there any more departures to be expected from Liverpool before the end of the window?**

Yes, I'm sure there will be quite a few but most will be simply loan deals.

We will probably see likes of Robinson, Coates, Ilori and Teixeira go on loan.

In terms of permanents, obviously there is Assaidi and Borini, plus it's unclear what will happen with Agger. He's clearly down the pecking order and Liverpool don't make a habit these days of keeping high earners to warm the bench.



* **Whats the current news on Assaidi ? has his proposed move to Stoke fallen through?**

Well, I can confirm Assaidi is still around because I walked past him in the Melwood reception area earlier.

Liverpool have a deal in place with Stoke and Assaidi has no future at Anfield. Things appear to have been held up by the player's demands for a pay-off. That's why there is a delay. Hopefully common sense will prevail and he will get himself down to the Britannia Stadium in the next few days.

&gt; The most common complaint levelled at Liebherr is that she does not ‘communicate with the fans’. It is certainly true that she is not one for giving interviews, but let us make a couple of things perfectly clear. **Firstly, the press complaint about not being forthcoming with fans is a nauseating smokescreen. They do not give a tenth of a damn about the club’s fans. Their grievance is that Liebherr has not been giving them stories to fill out their column inches and help them coast their way to another early lunch**. The second point is that exactly the same complaint could have been levelled at Liebherr’s late father when he was owner of the club. Just as she leaves communications to the likes of Les Reed and Ralph Kruger, her father left it all to Cortese. In fact, Markus Liebherr was almost universally praised for his silence, with the press stating that he was admirably keeping out of the limelight and letting the football men work unencumbered. So, **if Katharina Liebherr is just following her father’s style of ownership, why was he praised while she is castigated? I think we all know the answer**.

Secondly, I posted this mainly because the story pisses me off no end. The drug sounds fantastic, don't get me wrong, and it does appear to be very effective in improving the quality of life of those being treated. What it doesn't do, when used before chemo, is extend the life of the patient. Yes it's a nicer treatment but it doesn't have better outcomes and choices have to be made when there are finite resources. 

NICE are in such a difficult position and, to my eyes, do a great job assessing the actual science behind their treatment recommendations. They're saying, we agree that it's a good treatment and when other more affordable treatments have been unsuccessful then we will support it being used but we can't afford to use it straight off the bat even though it might improve your quality of life during treatment. I think that's absolutely fair enough and it really bugs me that the beeb are peddling this emotionally reactive story. It's anti-NHS propaganda and the BBC should be better than that.

true,rosscatherall,eng-TyneWear,Zoocastle,"Yep, I even put in a complaint through the jobcentre plus about my Avanta advisor using the jobcentres complaints email address, stupidly thinking that they'd conduct their own investigation into my issues. Know what they did? They forwarded it onto Avanta themselves, who forwarded a copy onto my Avanta advisor... The very woman who my complaint was about. 

Going through my local MP really did help though. It took a number of e-mails before they responded to me, but once they did he put his secretary on my case who called me down to their office. She had me sign a declaration stating that I'm handing my case over to them to look into and along with it copies of that sanction and the previous 7. 

On getting to the offices, she handed me their phone and sat with me whilst she listened in on following up with my mandatory reconsideration (this was 5 weeks after having sent it off). On getting through to them, they claimed that they hadn't received any requests for my reconsideration, despite the fact that I done it in person at the jobcentre. The woman on the other end of the line told me my only option was to fill out another mandatory reconsideration form and wait another number of weeks for it to be looked at.

I'm not sure who was foaming more, myself or the MP's secretary after I got off the line. She told me she'd be using the MPs official email address to take it higher up and that she'd get it sorted for me as quick as she could.

She phoned me twice on leaving the office that afternoon with updates and once again first thing the next morning to see if I'd heard anything back. 

She was shocked to hear of the amount of shit I'd been put through and the amount of shit I knew other claimants had gone through after talking to some people on courses and the like. She explained that it was the first she was hearing of this, because nobody else had bothered approaching them for help. 

More people need to speak to their local MPs regarding these work programmes and their sanctions. Although I imagine I got quite lucky with who my local MP is.



*Edit*

I did get a reply from Avanta about my complaints. I had 3 complaints, one was about Avanta holding 5 different addresses for myself in their system. One for when I did eventually move and it took them 4 weeks to action my change of address and another for when she walked out on a meeting with me.

With my multiple addresses, their reply was basically ""you must have told us different addresses from your actual address"".. Which is horseshit, on their system they had 5 addresses down for myself, one of those was my neighbour who I was in a dispute with that involved the council. Not a person I'd like to start receiving personal post. They couldn't come up with any change of address forms I had filled out when I asked them about it, because I know none of them existed.

Their reply for taking 4 weeks to change my address gets a little bit weird. They stated that they cannot change addresses without first being notified by the jobcentre themselves. So even though I e-mailed my advisor my actual change of address, she couldn't action it until the jobcentre sent her the forms. Which contradicts the first point. In the meantime, knowing full well that I had moved, my advisor continued sending out appointment forms to my old address. 3 of my sanctions were for this period alone. It turned out that the jobcentre did in fact send the forms to Avanta in good time, however it just wasn't actioned, so those sanctions were overturned after chasing them up for weeks.

I have to say though that the jobcentre I visit (james cook house in Middlesbrough) were really helpful in fighting these sanctions. They took copies of all evidence I had as and when it came through and sent them off to the sanction team (who were based in Wolverhampton). The problem is, the sanction team automatically just approves the sanctions regardless of what evidence you send to them with your reasons. So you have to wait until you get the letter that says your money has stopped for however many weeks/months and from there you have to go through the mandatory reconsideration. It's such an arse of a process and is undeniably made difficult knowing that there's people out there that wont pursue it.

The only exception I'm aware of is that it is permissible to offer a ""cooling off"" period with new accounts.  If you open a completely new ISA account and then change your mind within a short period of time (typically 7 or 14 days) the provider is permitted to close the account and you are treated as if it had never existed.

However all may not be entirely lost - remember that it is possible to transfer ISA funds from one provider to another, including between cash and S&amp;S accounts.  Providers don't have to support transfer in but if yours does that might provide at least a partial solution to your problem (although sadly if you really need this cash in your current account right now I suspect you may be stuffed).",0,1408106405,null,0,false,0,cjqxss2,t3_2dmka2,t1_cjqxss2,t3_2dmka2,null,1435249601,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Firstly, isolation and loneliness do not lead a person to depression. Depression leads a person to isolation and loneliness, a very important distinction.

Secondly, do you really think people that commit suicide don't know they are loved? Because it doesn't always make a difference. If a person is suffering so much that it leads them to suicide, who is selfish? The person ending his own life? Or the people asking him to keep on suffering so they don't have to mourn? I'm sure Robin Williams exhausted all options before resorting to this. The last way out, to deny nature itself, the only option left.

Finally, I don't endorse it, but if a person is suffering so much and has exhausted all possible options (often including drugs that have been known to sometimes WORSEN the depression as well as adding a whole host of new health problems into the patients life), then that's his/her prerogative and it's just a shame it cannot be done in a calm, controlled environment.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;&gt; that was classified as an allegation of rape by the English courts.

&gt; Was it?

Yes. The English court ruled that [it would be rape under English law](http://www.wikiwatch.org.uk/common-misconceptions/#notrape). Alas, the original court document is no longer available, but it is quoted on that page, and also [here](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/02/julian-assange-loses-high-court-appeal-against-extradition/).

The argument that it wasn't rape in England was actually one of Assange's grounds for appeal. An extradition can only happen if there is ""dual criminality"" - i.e. the allegation is an offence in *both* countries.


That's why Sweden refused to extradite [Edward Lee Howard](http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-27/news/mn-6899_1_norden) who spied for the KGB while working for the CIA, and allegedly caused the deaths of several CIA agents. The US wanted him for espionage: but that's a political crime in Sweden, so Sweden had to refuse the request. 

By the way: Assange would have the same protection, according to [a Swedish expert in extradition law](http://klamberg.blogspot.se/2012/08/extradition-of-assange-to-us-via-sweden.html).

You also said:

&gt; I believe under Swedish law that situation is treated as an allegation of rape

There's a different process, and the names are confusing, since in Sweden ""charges"" means something more like ""indictment"" (ie notice to appear in court for trial and the removal of liberty if one is a danger or a flight risk).

The test for extradition is actually if the accused faces ""criminal proceedings"". In England, this happens when you are charged (or ready to be charged if you cannot be found). In Sweden, it happens before ""charges/indictment"". I'm not too sure when, but it is after the investigation begins and before ""charges/indictment"".

So Assange is wanted for trial in Sweden. Under English law, he's well beyond the ""allegations"" stage, and past the point where he would have been charged.

This was another grounds for his appeal, and is covered in that second link. The first site [also covers that](http://www.wikiwatch.org.uk/common-misconceptions/#NoCharges), in a slightly more readable way.

Also covered on the first site is the related matter of the claim that [Assange is only wanted for questioning](http://www.wikiwatch.org.uk/common-misconceptions/#OnlyQuestioning) (you'll hear this a lot when he invites the Swedes to question him in the embassy).

The reason he is claiming that is that the Swedish process mandates that when he arrives in Sweden, he must be questioned in an final, official interview, before indictment (Swedish ""charges"") and the trial commences.

And that's why it cannot happen in the embassy: Swedish process mandates that after the interview and charging, the trial *must* take place quickly, for the sake of all concerned. If they interview him in the embassy, they would be unable to bring him to trial, and hence would be breaking the legal process.",0,1408108742,null,0,false,0,cjqyiyt,t3_2dmaad,t1_cjqyiyt,t1_cjqwo6j,null,1435249933,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

First off, Reus agency is one of the most greediest in the business(SportsTotal) Götze and Kroos are there, too. Think about it, Götze and Kroos earn between 10-12 mio €, Reus will get even more and I doubt A.Madrid could provide it without many unhappy players.

Secondly, it doesn't matter who reports anything. SportsTotal is extremely close to Bild and will leak them anything before any other newspaper and they, as every other source, report since the arriving of Reus in Dortmund that his clause only triggers in summer 2015 at 35 or 25 million €.

Thirdly, Reus just got the vice captain, is seriously thinking about renewing(he didn't do it because he wanted to get healthy first, the kind of thing everybody says), is at his childhood club with many of his old friends btw. he's also a Barca fan, our ceo and everybody else said that Reus is definitely not transfering this summer.

And last but not least, we're a PLC which means that if Dortmund gets such an offer without informing their holders, they'll get fined extremely.

So, they report bs except if they mean that they triggered the 2015 clause, which is possible at one point which we don't know. We only know that the possibility to trigger the clause is ending around March/April/May 2015 just like it was with Götze.""

That is correct for some people. However, plenty of them probably do find it a punishment enough. The problem we have is lack of prediction on ""what if"". Just like with children who weren't told yet that they shouldn't play with fire (and even then many of them still will!).

&gt;if the punishment was more severe then people would not want the death penalty back

Then why not advocate for longer and harsher sentences instead of going straight for the death penalty? It's just like with the EU. ""EU is bad, let's move out of it"", rather than ""We admit there are issues with the EU but we will work on resolving these issues first""

&gt;Not every person wants to be rehabilitated

Indeed, yet we shouldn't punish ALL people by default. Even if only 1 in 10 people truly wants rehabilitation, we shouldn't make a law which would not allow that one person to have a chance to rehabilitate.

P.S. Looking at USA, where there is a death penalty you can easily see that in fact it isn't as deterring as some would think of it.

You decided to post a rude comment in reply to a genuine statement. Stop trying to worm your way out of it.

&gt;Still, you haven't been able to determine how you support the club single handedly. 

[Reductio ad Absurdum] (http://www.iep.utm.edu/reductio/) rubbish.

&gt;You're way up you're own arse to realize that you don't.

Way up my are what?

&gt;No RAWK is the cesspool for deluded cunts like you who hate OOTers and wools. 

Absolute **nonsense**. I've stated, plainly, more than once, that I love the fact that Liverpool has global support. 

Here's a quote from my earlier post:

*""For what it's worth I fucking love the fact that Liverpool have support from all over the world. I love seeing fans travel from all over to visit and watch the games and they always get a warm welcome. People who live on a different continent going out of their way to buy the shirt? Great fans. The club runs because of people like that.""*

&gt;Deluded idiots who think they're the best of supporters since they go to the ground. It proves that cunts like you are a norm everywhere. RAWK being mean has nothing to this. What it does is that you're an entitled, deluded cunt who looks down on people.

People look down on **you** because you're an arsehole, not because you're from out of town. See the above quote.

&gt;I don't need anything from you certifying me as a supporter.

You aren't a supporter. If you were you wouldn't spend your time being a cunt to other fans and supporters on the internet, pretending you fucking know better than they do and being abusive. That's it. End of fucking argument.

Like I said, if you want to be treated like a member of the family, act like one.

&gt;But seems like by proving time and time again that you go to the ground are trying to appear as someone who's above and special compared to wools.

More nonsense.

My comment about being taken seriously and mattering to the club was in response to this statement of yours:

*""Stop trying to act like we have the veto of choice.""*

I stated that my opinion, and the opinion of other supporters, **does** fucking matter. Again, it's not my fault that you lack the comprehension skills to understand what's been said.

&gt;That's how the folks are RAWK are and you belong there.

Stereotyping, sweeping generalisations, abuse. You're a real one-stop-shop of nastiness aren't you? Haha! I'm already on there though, flower, and I see the majority of OOT supporters get treated well. Mouthy cunts, on the other hand, get given short shrift.

&gt;You're butthurt at the sarcasm.

Stop being cowardly and trying to write-off what you said as sarcasm. It wasn't. You entered into the conversation with a bunch of stilted, nasty comments and now you're crying like a kid with a skinned knee because you've been pulled on them. Grow up. Stop treating people like shit and it won't happen.

&gt;Nothing more to this. Rest of this exchange has been empty rambling and you swinging your dick around.

Have you not noticed? When you've raised actual points about the players mentioned I've engaged and replied in kind. When you've been abusive, I've replied in kind.

The only rambling has been coming from you, with your abusive, pidgin English.

&gt;Brave of you indicating violence online. Really brave. Go fuck yourself too. You're a fucking disgusting cunt.

What does 'indicating violence' mean?

I pointed out, quite civilly, that were you to be nasty and abusive to people face-to-face you'd get punched, and you fucking would.

Instead of being a frothing, abusive little helmet learn a lesson. Don't treat other people with disrespect for no reason. Don't be a cunt to fellow fans and supporters.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"EE can go and fiddle with them selves in the corner. Absolutely terrible company.

Network coverage is patchy, despite being 'the best in the country'. Yes, you cover the country, but the amount of times their network goes down is beyond belief.

But more annoying for me personally is the fact I've been on the phone 6 times now because my monthly contract bill is constantly wrong, and I'm yet to come across a customer service rep who can work out how to add VAT onto my bill properly. I've literally walked through the steps of doing that with one of their employees like I would with a 10 year old kid. He finally realised my bill was over charging me and the extra fees could not be accounted for anywhere at all, promised me 3000 extra minutes and the bill to be properly adjusted. 

Is it adjusted? Is it fuck. And now they think I'm going to be willing to pay 50p to teach someone basic maths faster in 10 minutes time instead of 20 minutes time? 

Sorry for the rant, but jesus they annoy me. The only reason I stuck with EE is because I was with Tmobile for years, they were brilliant.

I mostly get it for the pictures :P But seriously, its awesome thinking about what Neolithic people got up to, especially when you can see the remains of their little houses and temples and shit. Pretty cool that some of the best preserved neolithic sites in Europe are relatively close to home.

I'm not sure where I want to be, that's the trouble. Some measure of independence and a job that pays above min wage would be good enough for the moment.

true,OldManDubya,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"I think the point is, its good news that UK GDP growth is returning - however dishing out praise for it is a bit premature. After five years of almost non-existent GDP growth, it is likely that at *some point* the lost ground is regained. People can't go on with that slightly broken fridge or living in a house that's too small for the new baby forever.

It is worrisome that the growth seems to be based on many of the same sources as before - the wealth effect of rising asset prices and mortgage debt; a mismatch between wage growth and consumption growth etc.

There have been some encouraging signs though, there's a bit of a manufacturing recovery (though that is fragile and seems to have stalled with the weakness in main trading partners' economies), but more importantly the growth in our business services industry has been exceptionally strong for the past few years ([Interesting article about it here](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21600743-britains-new-champions-are-bean-counters-and-powerpoint-artists-rescue)). We should continue to support our visible goods industries, but Britain is never going to be the same type of manufacturing powerhouse that, say, Germany, is IMO. Culture, history, skills base etc. simply won't support it.

But what we need to see is the current rise in business investment being sustained, more credit to businesses and a reversal of the dismal productivity trend (which in itself is bad long term, but has been good in the short term - IMO its better for any economy to retain people in work less productively and paid less than it is to have sky-high unemployment). Then we'll be back to rude health.

Economic news is a mixed bag, but certainly an encouraging trend.

The Police complaints authority has gone through 3 changes since 1985 for the simple reason that it was constructed to absolve the Police as opposed to holding them accountable. Behavior such as this is'nt carried out by the constable foot soldiers, its much higher.

Years ago I had a complaint against a sergeant, he smashed my face in with his radio, serious wound. He tried to say I made a move to strike him so he hit me first. He then took me to court and tried to get me sentenced for it. His partner was so appalled that when he was in the witness box he confirmed that he did'nt see move to strike him, said he was looking the other way. When the sergeant was in the witness box. He looked shifty, nervous, and blinked like he had a nervous tic, not looking directly at the Madge at all.

My point is this. I went to Charring Cross. That's were the cops had their head office for North of the Thames and sat down with a Inspector. He basically told me the was nothing he could do, or would do because the evidence was'nt strong enough to reprimand the individual despite it being stronger than what the Sarge tried to convict me with, all the time he had a half smile on his face.

Since we like playing a quick triangle passes near the corner using (ST-CAM-Winger) then the ST gives a quick pass to the winger peels off who Runs down the sideline/goaline to find the striker again for the preferred low cross.

true,bottomlines,null,null,"&gt;You pick specifically on Islam. Why?

Because they are the ones acting terribly in the name of their religion or culture.

I don't believe in god, and I think all religions are pretty stupid. But in the UK, christianity doesn't do much of anything. As you said, current practice of christianity is clearly not incompatible with the modern UK. If you look at the US, fundamental/evangelical christianity does cause some problems and stops them becoming ""modern"" in many ways, but that's not really an issue in the UK.

However, the practice of Islam right now is pretty incompatible with the UK. The problem is that it is a very adherent religion and doesn't lend itself to adaptation. If you leave Islam, you are an outcast who gets punished and your family will disown you. As I pointed out in my original post, it is isolationist - forbidding relationships with any non-muslims, restricting social activities. And many cultural practices are coming from the 3rd world, but because they are tied to religion they are adhered to much more strongly.

&gt;we should seek to try and resolve that by having relations with the community

The eve of the English Premier League season provides a sense of hope for fans of all 20 domestic clubs, and no matter how each team looks on paper, there is optimism that it can exceed expectations.

Added to that optimism are the specific motivations within each club, as some are looking to re-establish their place within European competition (Tottenham, Manchester United), while others are hoping to avoid a late race to avoid relegation at the end of the season (Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion).

Here my ranking of where all 20 teams will finish at the end of the season, based on a combination of last year's performance and offseason additions and losses.

1. Chelsea (2013-14 finish: 3rd place)

Chelsea is not necessarily the most dynamic team in the Premier League, but there are very few holes in manager Jose Mourinho's team, particularly across the back line. The additions of defender Filipe Luis and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from Atletico Madrid improve a team that conceded a league-low 25 goals last season, and the additions of Spanish imports Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa bring more depth to a Chelsea attack that needed to rely on Fernando Torres as a primary attacking option at certain points last season. The Blues are the team to beat this season.


2. Manchester City (2013-14 finish: 1st)

There is always the concern of a title hangover, and no team has repeated as Premier League champions since Manchester United from 2007-08 to 2008-09. City arguably has the strongest attacking core in the Premier League, with powerful target strikers like Edin Dzeko and Alvaro Negredo offset by quicker, more explosive attackers like Sergio Aguero on the team's front line. These players are supported by an attacking core of Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and David Silva. However it remains to be seen how committed these players will be to defending this season, and particularly defending when the ball turns over, which was a weak point last season (City ranked third in the Premier League with 11 errors leading to goals in 2013-14).

3. Liverpool (2013-14 finish: 2nd)

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers supplied himself with a lot of personnel options this summer, and it may take some time for the new players on this team to grow into their roles. There is also an adjustment for incumbent attackers Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling, who must use their speed and guile to provide the same threat Luis Suarez did in the team's attack last year.
 
4. Arsenal (2013-14 finish: 4th)

The addition of Alexis Sanchez will be invaluable to Arsenal's attack, as he is capable of attacking from wide positions, taking on outside defenders or tucking in and serving as an additional forward next to Olivier Giroud. Behind them it looks like health will be the biggest concern for the Gunners, as promising midfielders Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain represent the core of one of the best midfields in the Premier League but their respective injuries kept Arsenal from climbing even higher last season.

5. Manchester United (2013-14 finish: 7th)

United manager Louis van Gaal believes he has the right tactical setup to put the current United group of players in a position to succeed, and is seemingly backed by the team's board to add more pieces if he deems it necessary (which appears likely before the August transfer window closes). While the new 3-5-2 formation will be an adjustment for this United team, the Red Devils added Southampton defender Luke Shaw along with Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera, the latter of whom should bring some stability to the team's central midfield (in addition to the five goals that he scored in La Liga last season, he led the team with 75 total tackles).

6. Tottenham (2013-14 finish: 6th)

New Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was the architect of an overachieving Southampton team last season, and the team's blend of high-possession football with direct play from long balls should work well with Tottenham's personnel. Southampton led the Premier League with 58.6 percent possession last season but also led the league in attempted long balls. This fluid combination between a patient and direct style at Tottenham could rejuvenate the careers of previous signings like Erik Lamela and Roberto Soldado. Meanwhwile, Christian Eriksen looks like a central attacking player Tottenham can build around, and the addition of Swansea defender Ben Davies should help with eliminating defensive mistakes along the team's back line.

7. Everton (2013-14 finish: 5th)

This summer, Everton managed to retain the services of young stars Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku while also securing leading passer and midfield link Gareth Barry to control the team's midfield. The team also features outstanding quality in the outside back positions with Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman. However, the improvements made by other top Premier League clubs combined with the additional distraction of a Europa League schedule are likely to expose the Toffees' lack of depth.

8. Stoke (2013-14 finish: 9th)

Stoke showed improvement in their attack last season after ranking last in both shots per game and shots on target in 2012-13, and the signing of former Barcelona midfielder Bojan Krkic is a mark of the team's continued attacking improvement. While Stoke slipped a little defensively from their 2012-13 campaign, manager Mark Hughes now has the option of deploying former Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley or Fulham holding midfielder Steve Sidwell into his lineup, and the team's overall improvement in talent should push it closer to contention for a Europa League position.

9. Swansea (2013-14 finish: 12th)

Swansea added Gylfi Sigurdsson and Ecuador international Jefferson Montero to their attack, and along with the impressive 16-goal season Wilfried Bony turned in last season, the team is likely to be more dangerous in the attacking third. Meanwhile, manager Garry Monk will continue to preach a style that emphasizes steady possession, and, with fewer turnovers, Swansea should remain a solid defensive team that does not give away many balls or make crucial mistakes.

10. Newcastle (2013-14 finish: 10th)

Newcastle took a league-high 54 percent of their shots from outside of the penalty area last season, and there have been equal concerns defensively as opponents needed fewer shots to score goals on Newcastle than they did in past seasons. The additions of Montpellier winger Remy Cabella and defender Daryl Janmaat are designed to solve each respective issue, and the team should finish around the middle of the league table just like it did last season.

11. Aston Villa (2013-14 finish: 15th)

A healthy Christian Benteke is the key to Aston Villa's 2014-15 season. After battling injuries and inconsistent form over the last year, the Belgian international will need to replicate his form from 2012-13 in order for Villa to have success.
 

12. Southampton (2013-14 finish: 8th)

Southampton lost many of their key players, along with their manager, to clubs that finished ahead of them last season. While those losses are an indirect tribute to what Southampton achieved last season, current manager Ronald Koeman must rebuild the team with the likes of Eredivisie leading scorer Graziano Pelle and skilled FC Twente winger Dusan Tadic. Neither is expected to replace the likes of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana in the team's attack, while the losses of Luke Shaw and Dejan Lovren on last season's back line will also make things difficult for the overachieving club to replicate a top-10 finish.

13. Sunderland (2013-14 finish: 14th)

While I don't think Sunderland will land more than 10 points away from relegation, the team has reason to be encouraged by the addition of former Manchester City midfielder Jack Rodwell and the rumored retention of Fabio Borini, along with the fact that the club ended last season with wins over Chelsea and Manchester United (and a League Cup final appearance). Manager Gus Poyet will have an entire preseason to work on the fact that defensively Sunderland conceded the second-most shots of any Premier League team last season. The back line should also be helped by the addition of former Manchester City goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon to push Vito Mannone for a starting spot.

14. Leicester (2013-14 finish: Promoted from Championship)

Every season there is one newly promoted team destined to surprise, and Leicester could play that role in 2014-15. Leicester won the Championship by nine points last season, never relinquishing their first-place position in the competition through the 2014 calendar year. Manager Nigel Pearson's team is anchored defensively by goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel (son of Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel) and the strong aerial presence of central defender Wes Morgan, while David Nugent will be the catalyst in the attack after scoring 20 goals and providing 12 assists for the recently promoted team.

15. Hull (2013-14 finish: 16th)

Hull was not a strong attacking team last season, ranking last in both take-ons and chances created per game. However, the team looked to address that need with the signings of former Norwich attacker Robert Snodgrass and promising attacker Tom Ince. Meanwhile, the team is steady defensively with the return of central defender Curtis Davies and holding midfielder Tom Huddlestone, and even a slight improvement on both sides of the ball should keep the team clear of relegation this season.

Ah United denied having interest in him so it must be true, because that's not common at all, is it. It's a real shame that some people are too simple to only believe what they read and they will believe anything they read. PSG and Bayern can't have took a look at him because I didn't read it in the newspaper but I did read that pigs can fly so that must be true. Stop acting like you know what goes on behind closed doors. 

Exactly, he said he wanted to back to England and specifically London, maybe that's why United made no formal offer considering they were favourites at one point. Then United claimed to have not been interested to avoid having it look like a rival got one over on them, which is quite a common practice btw.

It really annoys me how much people trust what is said in the media like it's gospel when 75% of the time it's not true.

You are taking this way too far mate. Man City and Man United just didn't need a Fabregas type player and made it clear they were not interested. It isn't anything more than that. 

He wanted London. His first choice, Arsenal said they didn't want him, he came to the only other team in London that could pay him what he wanted and plays at the level he wanted. Its that simple.

I might not know what goes on in closed doors but I sure as hell know that if a team even has the *slightest* interest in a player there would be rumors flying out of ever media outlet's ass. When you don't even have any fucking rumors flying around you know there is **zero** interest.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; Zionism is about support of a ""jewish homeland"", it's not necessarily about expanding the borders of Israel or being anti-Palestine. Anyone who supports the right of Israel to exist can be labelled Zionist, and will be by people who don't support the right of Israel to exist.

As I said, the notion of a 'Jewish homeland' is at odds with the notions of ethnic and religious equality. A country can't proclaim itself as having a bias in favour of the rights and interests of Jewish people and not be inherently discriminative. 

&gt; As for ""which is why more Jews need to stand up and vocally denounce both"", you might as well claim that more British Muslims need to denounce the actions of the Islamic State, or they'll face discrimination and abuse from people who will conflate Muslims and Islam with Fascist Islamism and it's proponents.

When it became clear that the British would be leaving India there was a lot of fear from minority groups, particularly the Muslims who were intensely worried about democratic rule by the Hindu majority. As independence approached there were increasingly violent riots between the various groups. 

Accordingly the British promised that no region would be forced to join the new state of India, and set up a panel - with not a single British or white person - consisting of representatives from each subculture to decide on the eventual form the country would take. When the six month deadline came up they had reached an agreement to partition a separate Muslim state (among other things), and the British duly helped implement it and went home. 

Sorry to lecture but I fucking hate that myth, no one even bothers to read the basic facts. The division was made by leaders called Singh, Nehru, Ambedkar - not especially British names. If you're looking to bitch about British line-drawing, you need to look at the Sykes Picot agreement and the Middle East.

So no I don't believe they know they are loved, they don't even have a measure for the world love, and the problem is as deeper into isolation as they get they will forget more and more of the basic experiences they have had throughout their lives.

Yes they are in that state that requires medicine to break from, but if you have known someone who has had mental breakdown, some of them are in denial and refuse help. Others will actively seek it.

true,AonSwift,null,Sir,"There's a lot more to it than that lad. The riot officers receive plenty of training. Granted there's always room for improvement, if any extra training is needed, I say traffic corp etc. should all have to undergo some small course in the case their ever needed like in the 2010 riots. Police don't just have the small circular shields. They have the big ones too, but they're used in different situations by different squads. If you have to be mobile and disperse a crowd, you use the round ones. But if you're ordered to hold an area, like during the student riots a year or two ago, you use the big ones. 

As for them not escalating situations, it all comes down to their orders. Even though the police heads say one thing, they still have to answer to all the government heads.. So they don't always get to do what they want, which is most of the time the best thing. And they don't escalate things when they don't want to risk any more getting hurt, it's the opposite. If there's a risk they'll pull back. Especially when they're in dangerous areas with high gang activity. That's where the armed response units come in. They act from behind the scenes, in plain clothes targeting prime suspects. 

The problem with the police in Ferguson, is they're not trained enough to be using that gear.. And what happens when you get untrained, trigger-happy cops in stressful situations? Their judgement gets clouded and someone dies. They have the numbers, if you want to tackle a riot the harsh way with rubber bullets, tear gas etc. that's more than enough to hold a line.. You don't need snipers and cops armed with assault rifles instead of shields. Now.. The risk of guns being used by rioters is a lot higher in the US, but just like us they have specialised armed response units and SWAT that can be kept on standby and act fast should something like that occur. 

Oh, and when I said better equipment, I meant items/technology for general policing and crowd control. Not armour and guns. There's a lot of tech in development that would be amazing, but no government will fund their police with it, especially when they won't even fund their troops.

&gt;Article 7.  
All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

&gt;Article 8.  
Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.

&gt;Article 9.  
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.

&gt;Article 10.  
 Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.

As well as a few things about freedom of thought etc. 

The UN does not at any point condemn the use of prisons, it just writes clauses to dictate in which circumstances they are allowed. 

We take away some of their freedoms, ~~but at no point do we deny them of any of their human rights.~~

The formation you mention focus' on width, you think that's a formation that would suit Barca? Give your head a wobble... You also just pretty much claimed formations are irrelevant in modern football, next joke...

You list all of those things about United yet they haven't signed a marquee signing yet, you'd think that would be a priority for a title challenging team that finished 7th last season, no? Hummels has apparently put off a move till next year because of no Champs League. The Vidal thing has dragged out and doesn't look likely. Di Maria pretty much chose PSG over United then PSG pulled out and only wanted to loan him. Quite clearly everyone is motivated enough to join United. 

The only striker City would sell is Negredo and he's injured and won't pass his medical. Also they're only allowed 14 foreign players in the Champions League which will put them off making signings and put any potential signings off.

Liverpool don't have as much money as people think. They made a loss of £80m last season but still complied with FFP because they wasn't in Europe. Now they're in Europe they have to get that loss down to £30m, they're gonna lose money in the League if they finish below 2nd which is more than likely, so unless they go far in the Champs League they're gonna have to save some of that Suarez money.

Yes, they didn't need Fabregas because they already had Herrera locked down.... *You* don't seem to be a clever guy...

&gt; Not every rumour is true

Exactly. If anything remotley close to a club somehow linking a player to the team is true than the media will make up shit. BUT NEVER has a team been interested in a player and the media doesn't have rumors floating around. You are much more likely to see a player rumored to a club that doesn't even want him.

Chelsea has been rumored with a lot of top players this transfer windows. Miranda, Benatia, Cavani, etc... But we were not interested in all of them, but I can honestly say that I think every player that was on Chelsea's radar at least had a couple of rumors floating around..


Also, Barca did laydown a price range and they made it clear to everyone that they wanted him gone. They would never do that if him and his agent already had multiple top teams after him. They basically put a for sale sign over his head..

&gt; A girl I met in Borneo who I really like is still there another couple of weeks and will also be coming down to London (where I study) for university for next year. No idea how she feels about me but another reason to hope I stay on at university.

&gt; The formation you mention focus' on width, you think that's a formation that would suit Barca? Give your head a wobble... You also just pretty much claimed formations are irrelevant in modern football, next joke...

Errr yeah. Width has always been a part of Barca's playing style. Or do you not remember Figo, Ronaldinho, Guily, etc. Sound like you've only been watching football for the last 3-4 years. And yes, formations are pretty much irrelevant in modern football. Its all about players' positioning at given moments in the match. A 4-3-3 isn't a 4-3-3 throughout the match. Pep's Barca should be the most relevant example for that.

&gt; You list all of those things about United yet they haven't signed a marquee signing yet, you'd think that would be a priority for a title challenging team that finished 7th last season, no? Hummels has apparently put off a move till next year because of no Champs League. The Vidal thing has dragged out and doesn't look likely. Di Maria pretty much chose PSG over United then PSG pulled out and only wanted to loan him. Quite clearly everyone is motivated enough to join United.

They haven't yet, but they will sign at least 1 more player before the end of the window. No CL isn't as big of an issue as you think. Modric chose to sign for Spurs over us. Erikssen did the same. Look at the number of high profile players City signed before getting into the top 4.

&gt; The only striker City would sell is Negredo and he's injured and won't pass his medical. Also they're only allowed 14 foreign players in the Champions League which will put them off making signings and put any potential signings off.

I don't know what world you're in if you don't think they'd make at least 1 serious push to sign Reus.

I think this is why we are all so quick to defend Daws even though he is past is best, and tbh maybe that was never quite good enough, he feels regularly like the only strong character/leader on the pitch. So assuming we need more than just our goal keeper being a leader who are the other options?

My best of the rest (all based on potential rather than right now):

* Capoe - looks solid and that he knows what needs doing, holds an important  position in terms of going forward and being a key part of defense (I think Sandro is more of a solider than a leader)

* Dembalee - maybe good choice IF he could hold down a starting spot

* Holtby - I think we all agree this could be the make or break season for Holtby, but if he does gel with the system, he seems to be learning his positional play MUCH better than we have ever seen from him, he might combine the intelligence and energy to be a leader of the team - might be along with Walker too much the team clown to make the transition

* Eriksen - basically clam, intelligent, and already directing most of our game-play, but might not have the confrontational side that being the captain might need.

Yes, horribly callous and cold though it sounds there is a degree of scale inherent in calling something a genocide or a holocaust. Otherwise every poor sod murdered by a drunk person on their way home from the pub is a victim of genocide - which you will agree is absurd.

&gt;What does the indiscriminate killing of men, women and children blockaded in into ghettos by a vastly superior military sound like to you?

Described in those terms, it *sounds* unforgivably awful. Unfortunately, there's seventy years of context your one sentence leaves out. These aren't people who were rounded up one day and stuck in ghettos to sate the Israeli's mad lust for land - they ended up in Ghettos after *starting* and then **losing** three all out wars of annihilation with the stated objective (not inferred, they shouted it to the world) of 'driving the Jews into the Sea.'

The reason they're *still* there is that for the last **sixty five years** they haven't managed to go for a single month without launching some sort of attack on Israel. 

The problem with the Arab-Israeli conflict is that it was originally a civil war which the Palestinians *lost* in 1948, but unique in the history of people who **have not** been exterminated, they refuse utterly to surrender and are incapable of sitting around a negotiating table without *also* launching mortars, suicide bombers and raiding parties at the people with whom they're negotiating.",1,1408125158,null,0,false,0,cjr6mz0,t3_2dmu1r,t1_cjr6mz0,t1_cjr68bh,null,1435253689,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

* Is it the new attention and respect for achievements that athletes get? Once the star leaves they can't be considered ""one man teams"" any longer so effort=acclaim

* Is it that superstars intimidate lesser players so they dont express themselves thinking ""I can never be **that** good!""

* Is it that teams are sometimes overly dependant on superstars and thus never bother trying to win by their own account

* Is it that teams are often built around giving the superstar as many chances to shine as possible often resulting in wasted chances or bad games when that player is off form?

The only one of these that might apply to us is the media. I know a lot of the team seem humble but most pro players have to be partly driven by ego so imagine how it felt for players to do something amazing but people focussing on Suarez either doing something even better or on why he didnt play that well, chief candidates for under appreciation being Sturridge, hendo, couts and Sterling. 

Hopefully they will thrive under the responsibility and pressure of being the reason we win games rather than having the safety net of Suarez doing something to fall back on.

Sounds like I've only been watching football for 3-4 years? Or I just don't judge the way a team plays off the way they used to play? When was the last time Barca actually played wide? Jesus. You genuinely think formations are irrelevant? hahahha. There's more to formations than just shape, even if they don't keep the shape of a 4-3-3 for the entire game they still play completely different than if they were playing say a 4-4-2.

Exactly they haven't yet, despite trying. You think if United had Champions League they wouldn't have signed a few already? What are you on about Modric chose Spurs over us? We never tried to get him until a few years after he'd signed for Spurs. As for Erikssen, we've never even tried to sign him... They signed players because they had ridiculous money and even then they only signed money grabbing squad players. 08/09 They signed Robinho, who was actually supposed to be joining us but we released a story that pissed Madrid off so they pulled the plug City was the only other team who would pay what they wanted. The following season, Adebayor, Kolo and Tevez. Besides that they signed a 34 year old Vieira and a bunch of players from mid-table teams, hardly massive signing for a team that had Europa, United don't even have that. 

It's not a case of making a serious push. Let's evaluate City's Champs League Squad. They're only allowed 14 foreign players. Let's start with the starters. Hart, Sagna, Mangala, Kompany, Clichy, Fernandinho, Yaya  Nasri, Aguero, Silva and Jovetic. That's 10 already from the 11 starters. So they need to choose 4 from Willy Caballero, Kolarov, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Fernando, Navas, Dzeko and Negredo. So they already need to make some huge sacrifices that will piss off players already without more signings. 

We made a loss of £43m but £20m+ of that was on upgrading facilities which can get written off if those facilities are available to the local council for events, which it did. Then we sold Mata and De Bruyne and for cheaper than we bought Matic and Salah, then we went on to the semi-final of the Champs League so we probably ended the season positive, their £80m loss was the amount at the end of the season after they received money from finishing second and TV rights...

Did you last look in 1979? I'm serious, that's one of the more absurd thing someone has said recently.

&gt;Golan Heights

Rabin, Barak and Olmert all stated explicitly that they would return the Golan to Syria completely in exchange for a comprehensive peace treaty, I guess after forty years of trying to make a lasting peace (after the Yom Kippur war, you know, the **third** failed invasion) they got tired of offering a peace agreement to people who wouldn't even talk to them.

&gt;West Bank

You know, when they withdrew (without preconditions) from Gaza in 2006, the Israelis forcefully removed the settlers and demolished them. There is no reason on Earth to believe they wouldn't be willing to do the same thing in the West Bank, *if the Palestinians could be convinced to stop shooting at them.* The fact that *four days after* the withdrawal from Gaza the Al-Aqsa brigade moved their launchers in to take advantage of the better firing positions may have made them more than a little reticent to unilaterally withdraw from the West Bank too - in the absence of a comprehensive peace plan and the *cessation of rocket/mortar attacks.*

&gt;Well by that logic we shouldn't really oppose the actions of the Russians in the Ukraine, after all they lost 20million of their population in WW2.

You seem to be operating under a misapprehension. I'm not stating now, nor have I ever, that the Israelis are 'allowed' to murder people because of the holocaust. I'm simply stating that claiming the Palestinians are victims of a genocide is absurd. 

The population of Gaza and the West Bank has risen from 800,000 in 1948 to almost 5,000,000 today. 

I'm not aware of any group in history that has achieved 625% population growth while being the victims of a genocide, so I return to my 'Israelis must be the most incompetent genocidal monsters ever' theory. Of course, that 625% population growth in two generations isn't wholly a consequence of high birth rate. Do you actually **know** where those extra two million came from? It's sort of important.

You seem to think there are two vague groups in the anti-Israel movement; Non-racists and racists. The racists can be identified by the fact that they are openly racist.

My position is that there are three groups. Non-Racists, Racists and people who don't self-identify as being racist but who are being racist.

The first group I have not and would not claim are being racist. There are a lot of them and I understand their arguments.

The second group we both agree are arseholes who we dislike and oppose. People who make comparisons to the Nazis and are not intending to be hyperbolic. People who randomly phone up Jewish names in New York and hurl abuse at them about Gaza. Physicians who refuse to treat Jewish patients.

The third group is the area we disagree on massively.

So, note that people who self identify as not being racist can be racist. Note that someone can say something which is horrible and racist and not intend it to be racist. Note someone can hold a racist position without being aware that it is a racist position. Note that someone can misinterpret a non-racist making a legitimate point and consider racist stuff to be legitimate as a consequence.

These are the people singing about destroying Israel without understanding what that means. They hear that Judaism is an evil cult and Zionism is inherently genocidal and this sends a bit of a conflicted message about how they feel about jewish people. Who hear the word 'massacre' and interpret that to mean that the Jews are proactively with full knowledge mowing down innocent children for fun. Who think that protesting outside of synagogues to protest Israel makes sense, who hurl abuse at people wearing Kippahs. 

We demand that all political groups denouce terrorism and mass murder to be legitimate.  That should apply to the anti-Israel movement as well.

It is not acceptable that British Jews have to have guards and razor wire fences around their schools to make themselves safe. It is not normal that British Jews have to have have security guards and panic buttons in their synagogues. It is not normal that when advertising Jewish events, we have to leave the address off our publicity material, sending it on later only to attendees who have been checked out. 

Just take a brief look at the [everyday antisemetism project](http://everydayantisemitism.tumblr.com/).

I think the major purpose of this is to tell our own government that we're miffed with its foreign policy regarding Israel. It's a largely symbolic gesture, but one that I think does have a place. 

As for the practice creating a hostile climate for British Jews, I'm afraid I disagree there. If there is any hostile climate for British Jews, it is one that existed prior to comments on Israel's actions by the government or other large bodies. The racists may use it as an excuse, but that does not mean the root of the problem is necessarily the boycotts themselves. 

&gt;this is how UK universities repay them

Jews and the state of Israel are two completely different entities, and boycotting Israeli goods and services does not in any way express any kind of ingratitude for Jewish contributions to academia. Furthermore, the achievements of individuals cannot be attributed to a collective. It is nationalistic chest-beating to claim you are a member of the same group as somebody with remarkable talents and contributions; that doesn't mean they are yours, and ultimately it is a statement of little substance. I think this is best summed up by one of the greatest minds in human history, Richard Feynman: 

&gt;Although born to and raised by parents who were Ashkenazi, Feynman was not only an atheist,[53] but declined to be labelled Jewish on supposedly ""ethnic"" grounds. He routinely refused to be included in lists or books that classified people by race. He asked to not be included in Tina Levitan's The Laureates: Jewish Winners of the Nobel Prize, writing, ""To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory,"" and adding ""...at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the chosen people'"".",0,1408127410,null,0,false,0,cjr7xww,t3_2dmu1r,t1_cjr7xww,t1_cjr2o6u,null,1435254613,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;

&gt;The __Brangwyn Hall__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Neuadd y Brangwyn*) is a concert venue in [Swansea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea). It is named after the artist [Frank Brangwyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Brangwyn), whose famous ""panels"", originally intended for the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords), are displayed there.

&gt;The Brangwyn Hall is part of the [Swansea Guildhall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildhall,_Swansea) complex, and is used for awards ceremonies and social events as well as classical music concerts and rock concerts. Among the ceremonies held at the Brangwyn Hall are the annual [Chinese New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) celebrations (for the Chinese community in Swansea) and the graduation ceremony for students graduating from [Swansea University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_University) and [Swansea Metropolitan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_Metropolitan_University). The [BBC National Orchestra of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_National_Orchestra_of_Wales) frequently use this venue when performing in Swansea. Additionally, the BBC has filmed some scenes from the *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* episodes ""[Silence in the Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_in_the_Library)"" and ""[Forest of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_the_Dead)"", as well as ""[The Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_(Doctor_Who\))"". 

&gt;The British Empire Panels were commissioned in 1924 as a means of commemorating the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War). Brangwyn, who had worked as an official [war artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_artist), was selected by the sponsor, [Lord Iveagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cecil_Guinness,_1st_Earl_of_Iveagh), an [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people) peer. He chose to create a ""decorative painting representing various Dominions and parts of the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire)"", and five finished panels were displayed in 1930. The work was completed in 1932, but the House of Lords had already rejected it as too colourful and spirited.

&gt;subverted due process by waiting until Richard had left for vacation,

Or that's just when they got round to doing the search, you know, once they'd got some time after prosecuting several other people - you'd have to be stupid to think the police have been twiddling their thumbs all this time. 


&gt; Police initially denied “leaking” the raid, but South Yorkshire Police finally confirmed yesterday afternoon that they had been “working with a media outlet” 


Yeah, because they didn't ""leak"" information, the BBC handed them evidence - and guess what, that pretty much tipped off the BBC that there might be a raid. 

&gt;This alone calls for an independent inquiry.

Only if you had no idea about the facts and worked purely on innuendo. 



&gt;The police, by choosing to raid the property in broad daylight 

Really? *Really*? Yeah! Let's pay them all double time to turn up outside of normal working hours and spend twice as long because they can't see anything!


&gt;Why was a search warrant granted? The law (the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act) requires police to satisfy a justice of the peace not only that there are reasonable grounds for believing an offence has been committed (if so, why had he not already been arrested?), but that there is material on the premises both relevant and of substantial value (to prove an indecent assault 25 years ago?).



Again, this is a judgement made by someone appointed to do it who actually knows the facts of the case, your innuendo and guess work about your mate doesn't qualify you.

&gt;Moreover, the warrant should only be issued if it is “not practicable to communicate”

And you in your professional capacity as just some guy have no idea what was practicable for them.


&gt; How was the Justice of the Peace satisfied that this whole exercise was not an improper means to publicise an uncorroborated allegation against the singer, in the hope of “shaking the tree” to attract further allegations which might give it some credibility?


I don't know, but that's why they're the JP and you're not, cos they are qualified to make that judgement and have been shown the evidence which you have no idea of. 


&gt;What will happen now? If the outrageous treatment of Paul Gambuccini and Jimmy Tarbuck is any guide, Cliff Richard will remain in a cruel limbo for 18 months or so until the police and the CPS decide whether to charge him. 

Yeah, it's funny how building a case takes time, maybe it'd be faster if there weren't so many celebrity pedophiles in the 80s. 


&gt;A case like that of Cliff Richard could not happen in most European countries, where time limits prevent prosecutions of most sexual offences after a lapse of 10 years.


Yeah! It was more than 10 years ago! Let's just let the pedos walk free! Let's encourage these sordid coverups.

For example: widespread sanctions placed on Russia (for allegedly funding separatists) - zero sanctions in Israel for straight up destroying most infrastructure in Gaza and murdering thousands for no reason - because the US didn't want the EU to do it.

As well as that, Crimea is historically a part of Russia - most of its citizens genuinely self-identify as Russian - forcing them to stay part of Ukraine when they don't want to (they were an autonomous region before this whole thing kicked off) would be akin to forcing the North to stay in the UK if they didn't want to.

The Eastern Ukraine situation is a little more grey in my opinion - Understandably, I am very sympathetic to people who feel that their self-identity is being attacked (as it is in Kiev, with very strong anti-Russia sentiment).

I think it's a combination of these things, and then a little eerie fact that there is a [nazi organisation](http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ukraine-nazi-emblems.jpg) that was formed by Kievs current government - that thing isn't really publicized in Western media, for some reason.

Look at Suarez, or Remy, or Negredo, or Aguero, or Torres, or Javi Garcia, etc etc. There's just as many examples of players who started and did well from the beginning as there are of flops. We don't need a proven premier league striker. We need a GOOD and TALENTED striker that fits Pochettino's system.

Even if we assume other teams get absolutely nothing from their shirt sales (which can't be the case) and just what the manufacturer pays in the contract we would have to sell about 50,000 shirts to be earning as much as Stoke. And that's ignoring the fact that as we're producing in house we're also footing the whole bill for manufacturing the shirts as well.

So in terms of manufacturer we are obviously last receiving nothing, and if we pretend it's cost us nothing to make the kit and other teams receive no revenue from their sales then we need to sell a shed load to catch up with other similar sized teams in the league.

In terms of shirt sponsorship alone only Palace and Burnley are receiving less than us.

Under this framework we could 'appear' to be on track over a span of games but then come to learn that our fixtures were easier during this time and we actually required more from our relatively easy fixtures. Think Arsenal in the first half or Liverpool in the second half of last season; we both had our difficult home fixtures in the opposite half of the season and performed better in the other half. This example is very simplistic and flawed *but* it does provide context to my point. I believe there is a more useful model used on on RAWK that actually categorizes the difficulty of fixtures (among other factors) whilst using the same basic 2PPG goal that you've noted as being a good benchmark for relative success.
