The Council House selloff generated a huge amount of money in the long run for low income families for example. 

The UK is London centric, no getting around that but we have the attitude of a big country when in fact we are tiny. London will always be the main draw for business, no matter what a government does it's just how it has and will always be so I find a lot of the anti London arguments to be a bit shallow because of it (i'm not say you are saying anything anti London btw). I personally am not sure what much more the government can do to boost wealth away from London / South other than with a slightly direct approach. They have done a lot of encouraging big business over the years to move there HQ's away from the city, Vodaphone is a good example, BBC, Orange as well I think. 

From a looking towards the future perspective, I personally think that many more people should be encouraged into things like engineering, computer science etc. High skilled jobs that are not reliant on location. 

For example my brother is a fully trained Architect, he was forced to come to London rather than stay in Glasgow because the only places willing to pay him what he rightfully should be making were here, they service all the other businesses here, removing themselves from London would just wipe away their bread and butter business. I see no reason though that an Engineer producing micro parts for a computer couldn't be in Leeds or Glasgow as it is obviously far less reliant on location.

I'd love a solution which avoids both a crash and house price inflation, but government underwriting private investments in the way you suggest is a bold conceptual leap.

The implicit basis of all this discussion is that the web of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps related to the British housing stock is so labyrinthine that any shock to large financial institutions could cause something approximating the collapse of Western Civilisation.

I genuinely don't know whether that's true or not, but since 2008 the idea that private banks should be regarded almost as an arm of the state seems to have entered the popular political consciousness without many people raising their voice in objection.

If this clause exists, and I am very very confident it does ( I mean seriously what manager/technical director wouldn't include this clause, especially if they are a team that is likely to be faced in Europe), then there is no way atletico would still try and play courtouis. We literally own the rights to him, only we decide who he plays for/against. If atletico illegally placed him in the team sheet against us against our wishes (the clause in the contract) we would literally be able to cancel the loan agreement right then and there due to them breaching the contract. 

To say that this clause is not enforceable is a joke. It's a legally binding contract that has the full power of the law.  You may need to go do some research in the basics of contract law.

2. I think 3rd is most likely. I believe we have around the same amount of chance winning the league as we have missing out on CL.

3. I do think he will stay in the summer but if we dip in form even a little bit, he might want out in the winter.

4. Evra because of his actions in the 2010 World Cup.

5. I don't think Liverpool's emergence has that much to do with United's down year. Rodgers has steadily been improving this team since he got here. However, we'll have to keep improving (defensive playmaking and squad depth, for example) if we want to continue to be title contenders.

6. Since everyone's saying the 4-1 win at Old Trafford, I'll say the 3-1 win at Anfield in March 2011 with the Kuyt hat trick. I believe it was Suarez's first United game, and what a game it was.

My conclusion is that austerity has been harmful to our economy and made the economic problems last longer and be deeper whereas in Germany with fewer cuts they have done much better in GDP terms. 

GDP Per Capita (PPP), US Dollars for United Kingdom in year 2013 is US$ 37,501.70 . 2008: 36,238.25 According to PPP we are a little richer than 2008 but Germany is a lot richer.

A player is in an offside position when closer to the opponent's [goal line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_line_(association_football\)) than both the ball and the second-to-last defender (which is usually the last outfield player), and also in the opponent's half of the [pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_pitch). ""Offside position"" is a matter of fact, whereas committing an ""offside offence"" occurs when a player is ""actively involved"" and is subject to the interpretation of the referee. Goals scored after committing an offside offence are nullified if caught by the referee.

Second of all, Sahin did not even physically step foot onto the field and didn't play a single minute vs Madrid so the entire argument is void. The clause would most likely state that player x cannot ""directly compete"" against the parent club.

Third, just because UEFA does not have a law saying loaned players cannot play vs their parent club certainly does not mean that the parent club does not have a specific clause in the contractual loan agreement that says the loaned player cannot play against the parent. I would say these loan clauses are very very popular and may loaned have these clauses. 

Long story short, Chelsea very likely (and would be so fucking dumb to not have this) has a clause that specifically states it's loaned players cannot play vs them in competitive fixtures.

Your defence is aging and no longer feared. It isn't how it was back when Vidic, Evra, Ferdinand etc. used to have that stronghold. Right now Jones is probably your only real defensive talent and the rest of the players are aging and need to be replaced. Rafael and Fabio are okay. 

Your midfield used to be great with Kagawa, Giggs, Nani and Fletcher but just like the rest of the squad the players are old and aging. Januzaj is probably the best potential thing you have going on right now however compare him to Sterling and Januzaj seems like another average overrated English player.

RVP, Rooney and Hernandez are class forwards that I cannot deny. However Hernandez is never played and really deserves some game time (I hope he leaves for greener pastures.) RVP and Rooney on the other hand have not been as clinical as previous years.

She was entertaining, sure, but after more than 1 episode? I don't see it.

Now you could say, 'well of course not, the companion generally isn't supposed to be a historical figure', and that'd be valid. So presume for a moment it wasn't Cleopatra, and it was a commoner woman from the same time period...

Enrique and Flanagan are both quality fullbacks. However the injury on Enrique was disappointing as well.

Johnson has been great over the past couple years however I don't see him as someone who has a proper place in the team right now due to his quality for wages etc.

Cissokho was alright but he is a loanee that I don't think will stay.

The only definitive and unambiguous factor that would with 100% certainty prevent Courtois from playing against us would be a UEFA rule prohibiting that.  Such a rule doesn't exist.

Everything past that is pure speculation.  You have no way of knowing if there is such a clause in the loan contract or not anymore than me.  You assert that such clauses are very very popular but you have 0 evidence to support that either, in as much as there's no chance you've ever seen a single such contract first hand, let alone many of them that would allow you to make such a generalization. For example, in the particular case of Sahin, it's pretty safe to assume such a clause didn't exist, or he wouldn't have been named to the substitute bench.

So no, neither you nor I know whether such a clause exists.  But what I do know, and I can tell you that with 100% certainty based on my experience with contracts and employment law, gleaned in navigating a variety of NDAs and NCAs that are extremely popular in my line of work, is that people insert clauses into contracts that have absolutely no chance of being upheld in arbitration all the time.  And if you suspect that the other party violated the term of such a clause, you don't get to immediately break the terms of the contract yourself, as you've asserted in your other reply.  Any semi-competent mediator would find that you acted in bad faith if you were to do that.  Instead, you'd take the contract to a mediator and try to get it annulled for breach.  And if the mediator finds that the clause that was violated was invalid, he would refuse to break the contract.  But regardless, mediation takes time and the mediator in this case is Fifa Dispute Resolution Chamber who are notoriously slow.  By the time this would get resolved, Courtois' loan would likely end anyway, so even if such a clause exists, there's very little risk for Atletico to break it, if they were so inclined. 

But anyway, all these legal nuances are nice, but are completely non germane to this topic, because as I've told /u/newyorkblue, I doubt this would ever reach arbitration, because I very much doubt that Chelsea would attempt to prevent Courtois from playing in the first place.  They know that there's no precedent on enforcement of these clauses.  They know FIFA and UEFA take a dim view of clubs attempting to contractually circumvent their rules (or lack thereof).  They know that preventing him from playing would play out poorly in the media and with Courtois himself, whom they're attempting to get to sign a contract extension.  They realize that avoiding the unlikely short term damage of being eliminated from the UCL this year specifically due to Courtois' play is not worth the potential long term headaches of preventing him from playing.  It's simply a poor idea, and they know it, and won't do it.

And in the case that we do draw Atletico, I'm willing to back up my assertion with a bet.",0,1394594261,null,0,false,0,cg0ez5e,t3_20670e,t1_cg0ez5e,t1_cg0dyl9,null,1432762514,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I looked into things a bit and it turned out as I suspected they were of Ulster heritage (or Scots Irish here in the US).
Why people aren't aware of this ethnic grouping?  I am going to guess...people largely ignore the southern US.  The people in the mountain communities are aware of it.  
(Plus I am living in New Orleans currently until I depart for Glasgow.  While my friends are of French and Irish Catholic heritage...I'm the only person I know of in New Orleans with Ulster ancestry). :-)

true,unitycommittee,lfc68,,"&gt; Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

Absolutely delighted with the team and the manager. I am secretly hoping that this is the beginning of your own twenty years of pain and failure. I've supported Liverpool all my life and I've known nothing but United's dominance, so you can understand my relish at what Moyes is building at Old Trafford!

&gt; Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

Realistic expectation is top four. Very happy at the potential prospect of finishing third. Keeping very quiet about the chances of anything higher. 

&gt; Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

I think he will, all the signs are good. I don't have an opinion on specific players, but we desperately need to sort our defence out.

&gt; Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

Van Persie, because he gets away with so much. I'm so pleased with the rumours that he will leave, just showing what happens when you buy a player with zero loyalty.

&gt; Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

If Manchester United were first or last, it doesn't change what Rodgers has done this season (and the end of last season). It's not like Suarez and Sturridge have decided to score goals just because United are crap. Bizarre question.

&gt; Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

The 4-1 was incredible but looking at this season, the 1-0 at Anfield was fantastic in terms of the wider context. It was so tense I thought I was going to have a heart attack. It gave a good indication of what our season could be after a wretched summer with Suarez.

&gt; Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

I would love to say 5 nil to us, but its more likely to be 3-2 to us. But, you are the jammiest bastards that have ever played football, so I wouldn't be surprised whatever happens.

&gt; Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.

true,el_matt,hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt;There very frequently isn't room to make the overtake

Mm, and yet people do it anyway. I've nearly been knocked off several times because someone absolutely has to get to the red light before me. Personally I'd rather have a queue of cars behind me than be fearing for my life every 30 seconds. It only takes a minute or two to get to a wider stretch of road where the overtake becomes safe and voila, no more delay for the drivers and much less chance of injury or death for me. Win-win.

Don't get me wrong, I get your point, and while the pass in the video was a bit close for comfort, it doesn't seem like it was overly dangerous, but it easily could have been if the road conditions were different, and a lot of drivers just don't bother adjusting their driving style, because they don't think about it. It's really a mentality that is shown in that kind of pass, rather than the physicality of it, that pisses me off.

As for ASLs, I'm in two minds. I appreciate the argument for motorbikes using them too and in a practical sense there's not much wrong with it, but again I kind of like the idea of having an area set aside for foot-cyclists only (which are frequently violated by other road users regardless).

But anyway thanks for expanding on your original comment. I imagine you have read the Highway Code, but just in case you haven't seen that image guideline for how to overtake cyclists it's [here](https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/static/hc/hc_rule_163_give_vulnerable_road_users_at_least_as_much_space_as_you_would_a_car.jpg).

In practice I'd agree with an argument that that vehicle has taken things to an extreme in this case, but if you imagine the cyclist riding further out into the lane (perhaps to avoid a stretch of potholes on a badly-maintained road, for example) it becomes eminently reasonable.",0,1394612747,null,0,false,0,cg0kf3m,t3_2065cf,t1_cg0kf3m,t1_cg0jnxs,null,1432765138,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

These houses are 2 ups 2 downs, decent sized, for around 100k, plus they are very central to Birmingham but still quiet enough for families. In recent years these houses have just been bought up by landlords, currently on one road of around 40-50 houses, im 100% certain, that a minimum of 30-50% are owned by landlords ( i know of at least 15 myself.) The landlords are lapping up these properties due to the space, accessibility and high yield return (15% in some cases, THATS HUGE!!) ,Not only is this ruining the area its also stopping affordable housing being affordable.

You fill a balloon up and its starts to rise, but at some point that balloon 'pops,' Falling back to earth.
Houses are the same, you rise the prices people buy them, your rise them more, so people continue to buy. But after a while you have millions owning houses they cant ever afford and the people that want to buy houses cant afford to buy them, causing a 'pop' in the market. With no or little demand due to price, people dont buy so prices must drop, but this means all the people with current mortgages now have negative equity. Their property has also 'popped,' so their house is worth nothing compared to when they bought it. 
The best solution for all parties, Govt, Banks, US, a market in which houses are affordable,  and rising slightly below the wage increase, meaning banks are guaranteed their money, the govt gets its tax, and we get housing.
Do some research into the USA property market, you'l soon understand that high house prices arnt the solution that parties want. Do some more research into the irish property market and youl see why building LOADS of housing is also a major problem. Its a fine line that is in desperate need of support.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; There very frequently isn't room to make the overtake
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Mm, and yet people do it anyway. 

Well, people pass anyway - they cannot make the overtake as prescribed because there's not the spare lane hanging around. I don't drive a car, but I've sat on my motorbike behind a cyclist going up a hill for fear of overtaking too close for a mile or so and I don't think either of us enjoyed it one bit.

&gt; I've nearly been knocked off several times because someone absolutely has to get to the red light before me. Personally I'd rather have a queue of cars behind me than be fearing for my life every 30 seconds.

I really don't find a queue of held-up traffic to be so great for calming my fear for my life - I always think that the closer everyone can get to just getting on with going to wherever theyr'e going the safer we're all likely to be, and that includes letting cars drive faster than the 14mph or whatever it is that I'm cycling at as much as it includes letting me ride on the right hand side of the yellow line. Wanting to get there, wherever 'there' is, quicker seems a perfectly reasonable desire.

&gt; It only takes a minute or two to get to a wider stretch of road where the overtake becomes safe and voila, no more delay for the drivers and much less chance of injury or death for me. Win-win.

Yeah, if there's that wider stretch of road within a few minutes, and the drivers know its there and suchlike, sure. Otherwise it's a little bit like being stuck behind a caravan or a tractor on a winding road.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I get your point, and while the pass in the video was a bit close for comfort, it doesn't seem like it was overly dangerous, but it easily could have been if the road conditions were different, and a lot of drivers just don't bother adjusting their driving style, because they don't think about it. It's really a mentality that is shown in that kind of pass, rather than the physicality of it, that pisses me off.

Yeah, and as another 'vulnerable road user' I understand the thing about drivers apparently never paying attention to anything, but I think the rule should be that they need to pay attention rather than written assuming they need not.

&gt; But anyway thanks for expanding on your original comment. I imagine you have read the Highway Code, but just in case you haven't seen that image guideline for how to overtake cyclists it's here.

Yeah, [there's another discussion above](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2065cf/driver_gives_a_pretty_valid_excuse_for_not_giving/cg062js) about the precise meaning of that image and its accompanying rule.

Mental Health charities like Rethink and Mind are always looking for volunteers and they really welcome applications from people with personal experience of mental health issues.

If you're interested in working with young people Barnado's and Childline do great work and offer some excellent training for their volunteers. It might also be worth contacting your local children's centre, many use volunteers to run groups for young people with special needs or parents affected by mental health issues. 

I also just wanted to add that while working in social care (either in a paid or voluntary capacity) is extremely rewarding it can also be emotionally draining so it's important to take care of yourself and ensure you have a good support network in place to help you manage the more challenging aspects of the job.

Council estates were at one time full of working people with aspiration, but they were heavily regulated.

How many of the rose-tinted brigade would sign up to that?

Then social housing moved to be assigned purely on need. This meant that bit by bit estates replaced working people with those with social problems of one kind or another, and a cycle of decline began to the point that people who could, got away.

When Mrs T let people buy council houses, many saw it as liberation from a form of serfdom. That is forgotten now, but lots of those early buyers were fleeing from being told what to do, from not being allowed to even paint their front door, or undertake repairs etc.

Is this satire? 

Anyway, it hurts you to have to think about being brainwashed and it's probably too much of a provocative term to use in the context of a conversation with members of the general population. 

Howabout ""culturally conditioned""? 

You are culturally conditioned to believe that working for a wage is virtuous and that your living is somehow earned. It doesn't matter that 80% (this is an arbitrary number, you can pick another big one if you like) of waged work is useless or harmful and it would be better if you didn't do anything than something useless or harmless.

Having said that, in a reasonably decent environment, no one would not do anything. Relieved of the need to work for wages, most people would, I think, engage themselves in something useful. 

EDIT: In summary - working for a living is something you'd have to be conditioned to do because if you thought about it, you'd realise that for most people working for a living is against their interests and those of society at large.

I see two solutions. 

First, don't build giant estates of social housing. Build some houses, use some for social housing, rent some out, and sell some. Incidentally these sales would cover the cost of building the housing. This will create nice small mixed tenure estates of good quality housing where people can't tell at first glance which are social housing and which are owner occupied. Our local housing association is buying up properties in random locations around the town, and they don't have the stigma of being in &lt;shithole estate&gt;.

Secondly, once we build enough of it, there won't be a stigma any more, because too many people will be using it. 

I would expect the low end ""emergency housing"" to disappear as social housing becomes available. 

One political problem we'd need to overcome is the all too common attitude of ""why should a social tenant get a nice house when I've had to work for mine"".  There's a strand of British culture which would like to see ""scroungers"" given a bad deal *even if this costs the taxpayer more*.  The real politics of envy...

* Measure rice in cups (1 cup per 2 people is ample for us), add to pan.

* Add 2x the amount of water you had for rice (1 cup rice : 2 cups water).

* Bring quickly to furious boil, stir sparingly, just to stop it sticking to the bottom of the pan.

* Once boiling, turn down the heat drastically if not off completely (otherwise it will boil over), and let it simmer for a few minutes, until any water barely bubbles from the sink-holes the boiling process makes in the rice, or to taste (some like it stodgier than others).

Not entirely true!  For Parliamentary elections it was always ""one man one vote"".  For some of the other local elections, you had to be a ratepayer (i.e. pay a local annual property tax).  This is where the anomaly lay, as landlords and business owners could have as many votes as they had properties on which they paid the rates.  

This did have a discriminating effect but not just on Catholics but on most working class people.  The Civil Rights campaign and marches in support of one-man-one-vote of the time were non sectarian and cross community and supported by Unions and Liberals.  Those that opposed it were the establishment and the ruling class.

Unfortunately too much of NI history is simplified with the use of a broad Sectarian brush (Catholic V Protestant) forgetting the details of the time that were just as important such as the ongoing Class struggle (a struggle that continues today, although Capitalism has really won in the west) .

I suppose its a lot easier to Murder, Torture, Main and Mutilate based on flawed sectarian propaganda than it is to understand the context of history and find Peaceful solutions.  I think a form of KISS applies here Keep It Simple and Stupid because we can't be arsed looking further than our acquired prejudices

By handing over the deposit, the government artificially increase demand which keeps house prices high.

You might say that it is to help young people who can't save for a deposit because of high rents. However, the rents are so high because house prices are high (and increasing) - the renters are there to pay off the ""investor's"" mortgage (which is large because house prices are high). The problems are all down to the house prices being too high. Giving people (practically) interest-free money is not the way to fix it.

The other thing is that with the view of houses as an asset (and the belief that prices will continuing to increase), if you find yourself with £50-100k to invest, it makes sense to buy a property with the cash as a deposit and then cover the mortgage by renting it out.. thus continuing the cycle.

 I agree that Toure should not play much next season but lets be honest the main reason he played a lot this season is the fact that both Agger and Shako have been injured for what seams to be most the the season.

&gt;The matter of fact, Cech has come out stating he wants to continue as long as possible, and this was only a year ago.

This is what he added after: ""As long as I'm relatively healthy and my body will let me continue, I will continue.""

Its cute that you think I would remember, but I actually didn't even see your username until you responded with your typical ""idiot"" rebuttal. My aggressive tone was due to the pretentious nature of your original post, which was mostly just a rehashing of what's written in the papers everyday.

&gt; I did not bother give you a response on your ""points"" as I felt it was well, pointless. You provided little substance to your ""points"".

I have provided adequate points for you to respond to. With regards to Benitez, Roman and Torres, I gave you a background as to why Terry was not in the team last season and why people were saying that his career is over as compared to this season - this came up because you claimed you were surprised that by how well Terry has been playing. In simpler terms: Terry has always been this good but was phased out last season due to his injuries and a manager that systematically destroyed his confidence. How does that mean nothing? 
The fact that your only response to this is a weak attempt at questioning the integrity of my posts only goes to show that you don't actually have any counter points. You're just refusing to accept it due to your Kanye sized ego. Its sad that I have to provide an explanation for the points I've already provided explanation for.

&gt;Then with Shaw, and profit from the sales of Mata and KDB, sponsorship deals with Adidas and Samsung? What the fuck does that have to do with Shaw being an unnecessary purchase for Chelsea as they have Azpi and Brana already?

I thought it was fairly obvious why we needed to sign Shaw, but here, I'll explain it to you in as simple words as I can: Home grown players. We need them. We didn't sign him last summer because we did not have the funds to facilitate the move. Get it now?

&gt;And for you to say that Cahill is only where he is today because of Terry, well I'm not even going to entertain.

Why bring it up if you're not going to entrain it (which by the way you already have by bringing it up)?

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; 'What do YOU mean by poverty, then?' asked Easton.

&gt; 'What I call poverty is when people are not able to secure for themselves all the benefits of civilization; the necessaries, comforts, pleasures and refinements of life, leisure, books, theatres, pictures, music, holidays, travel, good and beautiful homes, good clothes, good and pleasant food.'

&gt; Everybody laughed. It was so ridiculous. The idea of the likes of THEM wanting or having such things! Any doubts that any of them had entertained as to Owen's sanity disappeared. The man was as mad as a March hare.

&gt; 'If a man is only able to provide himself and his family with the bare necessaries of existence, that man's family is living in poverty. Since he cannot enjoy the advantages of civilization he might just as well be a savage: better, in fact, for a savage knows nothing of what he is deprived. What we call civilization--the accumulation of knowledge which has come down to us from our forefathers--is the fruit of thousands of years of human thought and toil. It is not the result of the labour of the ancestors of any separate class of people who exist today, and therefore it is by right the common heritage of all. Every little child that is born into the world, no matter whether he is clever or full, whether he is physically perfect or lame, or blind; no matter how much he may excel or fall short of his fellows in other respects, in one thing at least he is their equal--he is one of the heirs of all the ages that have gone before.'

&gt; Some of them began to wonder whether Owen was not sane after all. He certainly must be a clever sort of chap to be able to talk like this. It sounded almost like something out of a book, and most of them could not understand one half of it.

&gt; 'Why is it,' continued Owen, 'that we are not only deprived of our inheritance--we are not only deprived of nearly all the benefits of civilization, but we and our children are also often unable to obtain even the bare necessaries of existence?'

It shouldn't be as it is now with housing associations building houses with rent costs the same as those in the private sector and every aspect of it now devolved from the council and run for as much profit as can be had without a scandal developing.

The Tories knew that those trapped on council estates would be flocking to buy 'their' homes - as a means of escape, despite them being funded by tax payers and the entire intiative being to help people in the long term. They did so in their droves but when they moved out they were snapped up by canny developers and the rich I referred to above and are rented back via the local authority for far more rent than equivalent social housing stock still retained by the council. I'll give you an example. In my village there is a road which is full of council housing. Now about 80% is privately owned, maybe more. A council tenant will pay about £340 a month whilst the privately owned ones can go for £1200. (2 bed houses) About £300 or so is met by housing benefit for those in receipt of it, the rest the tenant has to find, yet look at the 2 differences in price.

It's likely they were never taught a proper work ethic.. You can see it in this country a bit. Kids whose parents don't work can grow up with a crappy worth ethic. Not always, but some do. 

Combine that with low wages and you have a recipe for disaster. 

Then there's the corruption and bribery. If you have even the tiniest bit of power over someone in Africa you should be asking for a bribe. You have the power, they want the power, they need to pay for it.

So in Feb 2012 the powers that be decided that a 1-5 defeat to West Brom was the last straw for McCarthy and he was clearly no longer the man to keep us up in the Premier League. In their infinite wisdom, the board decided that Terry Connor was the best (only) option and we set about failing to win any of our remaining games and finishing bottom of the league.

Stale Solbakken was then brought in.  Things were going OK however performances were stale (pun intended) and it was clear that the players were just not buying into his ""footballing vision"".  Wolves started to drop down the Championship table (after being 2nd in around October) and in January 2013 we lost to Luton in the FA Cup.  Despite being (fairly) clear of the relegation zone, Stale was sacked and Dean Saunders was appointed.  

It was yet another change of manager (which was embarrassing) but at least Saunders seemed to be a manager more in the mold of McCarthy.  Hard graft, high workrate, lots of running and lots of hoofing.  Clearly this is what the players wanted as the ""good football"" that Solbakken had attempted to bring to Molineux was too complicated for their delicate minds.

It turned out, however, to be a disaster.  Wolves fell into the relegation places and despite a few good results at the end of the season, it wasn't enough to keep them up.  Saunders was sacked almost immediately and Kenny Jackett was appointed.  

One of the first things Jackett did was to ""banish"" several senior players to the reserves and begin a clearout of the huge, underachieving squad.  The season started well however performances were a bit iffy, often pulling out narrow victories whilst being outplayed (3-2 against Swindon is a good example) however since the defeat against Gillingham we've been bossing it.

But one thing I've still can't comprehend is that the side Manchester United is playing with ATM. won the title last season, and now they're shite? Either its Moyes terrible tactics or the players that doesn't give the same respect that they gave Ferguson?

* 2: My expectations were at the start of the season that we would get into top 4, fighting Tottenham &amp; Manchester United. Now, I'm eyeing that number two spot hard! However, I keep dreaming of that number 1 spot, but Chelsea is immense so I'm really happy about that 2nd.

* 3: If we get Champions League, sure.
Some new left &amp; right backs, some more depth in the CDM

* 4: Gary Neville, no doubt

* 5: Look at the table; we're having a great season, so yeah. It is not only because Manchester United bad season. Liverpool trashed spurs away, and Arsenal &amp; Everton home.

* 6: 1-4 win at Old Trafford, what a game! I saw the game with two of my mates who are big Manchester United fans. I still remember them talking about it was to be a walkover after the early penalty kick by Ronaldo.

* 7: A close game, Manchester United showed great form against West Brom, and were really one of the first teams this season to get more than 1 point at the Hawthorns. I'm excited! Especially i have a bet with one of my mates that if either team lose, one must run down the street in undies yelling the opponent teams name.

* 8: I think Liverpool will come 3rd. Manchester United 6th.

This is the heart of why this article ties itself in knots; who is arguing that this is a solution? 

The author makes the concession that not all cases of volunteerism are bad...eventually...after 15 paragraphs of arguing the other view...but gives no examples of what he considers ‘good’ volunteerism. Are we really all just individualistic economic consumers who follow thatcherite ‘there is no society’? What happened to ‘be the change you want to see in the world’?

Why should people be slaves to other people’s political views or problems? I shouldn’t tidy up my street with my neighbours because it hurts your negotiating position with your manager? I shouldn’t find another way of getting to work because you want to close the tube for the day? I shouldn’t get on and teach myself because you’re having a fight with the teachers unions?

No one gave a crap about NHS consultants dong a ‘work-to-rule’ when the Government changed their pension plans (again) after promising they wouldn’t. The reason for this is obvious; Consultants are well paid despite the heavy workload they deal with, and no one feels sorry for the wealthy.

The consultants gave up when they realised they were never going to get public support. Why shouldn’t the unions of the less-well-paid give more attention to what the public will be prepared to support? 

Its arguing that one sort of working-class pity should replace another.

It depends on the circumstances and the charge. If you were solely convicted of Common Assault (like the PC) then assuming you had no previous you'd probably get the same sentence.

If you had previous convictions you'd get a more severe sentence.

If you punched the PC whilst resisting arrest for say, criminal damage or theft they you'd probably get a No Separate Penalty. In effect the PC can be punched whilst arresting you and the offender probably won't be punished for it.

The monthly repayments on the property are £200 LESS per month than we've been paying in rent for the past few years.

&gt;And once you've got all these people on these mortgages, what the hell happens to them in a few years time if interest rates go back to normal and all of a sudden monthly repayments jump up. It's going to be messy.

You are correct in stating that interest rates are higher for 95% LTV - but this is the case with all mortgages, not just HTB. There are fixed deals available (i.e. we went with a five year fix at 4.19%).

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; What's In a Name?

&gt; **The 'Social'**: When I first became unemployed this payment was commonly known as Social Security, or colloquially simply as the Social. It was viewed as a safety net against destitution. It reflected an attitude that every human being should be protected from starvation and homelessness. As such, anybody who was deemed to need it received it.

&gt; **Income Support**: Later the name of the state subsistence payment was changed to Income Support. The idea was that everybody, no matter who they were or whatever their means, was obliged to try to obtain an income through their own initiative. However, if the free-market worth of their labour were not sufficient for them to subsist, then the state would top it up or support it with an extra payment. The attitude of society-at-large was that everybody needed - and should by some means receive - an income sufficient for the purpose of sustaining their lives. However, in my case, as I suspect for most, the term 'support' was a misnomer. It did not merely support my income: it was my income.

&gt; **Job-Seeker's Allowance**: Later still, the name was changed again to Job-Seeker's Allowance. This reflected a hardening of social attitude. This name implied that everybody had an obligation to find paid work and that the payment was specifically to meet the expenses of seeking that paid work. If any recipient found himself for any reason unable to convince the relevant authority that he was actively seeking work then the payment was stopped. It reflected the hardening attitude that if one were not seen to be seeking paid work - for any reason - then one had no right to live.

true,MHaaskivi,null,null,"I think it's a lot easier to forswear depth when you don't have to manage on multiple fronts. Rodgers has a squad that's mostly uninjured, all fighting over playing time for the ten remaining games. It makes a ton of sense to not have Wisdom, Robinson, Ilori, Coady, etc. here; they'll never play at all, whereas they can be blooded elsewhere.

I'm vaguely worried about the way that a lot of incoming transfers under Rodgers seem to come in for a bit and then phase out of existence (Assaidi, Aspas, Alberto, Sahin, Moses, Borini). The common link there is those are all attacking mid players (or players deployed as attacking mids, at any rate); his record at buying or borrowing attacking mids that can work with our system is basically one (Coutinho) out of seven, and that's a LOT of money spent (about 50 million if I'm guessing right) to get one player who's actually effective. I like Coutinho, but he's not worth 50 million.

Added into that frustration is that, while Rodgers has been successful at moving players out on loan, there's apparently some kind of block when it comes to actually bringing players in in a timely fashion that's frustrated deals for Willian, Salah, etc. over a couple of markets now. If Rodgers is indeed given 60 million to spend for making the Champions League, is he also given fluidity to spend quickly and to add a few million over a predetermined value to clinch a deal at the last minute? Because, right now, it appears we're doing Tottenham and Chelsea's scouting for free, talking about it in the papers, and then watching those players sit the bench at other clubs while we complain about depth.",0,1394633071,null,0,false,0,cg0oj59,t3_2085g5,t1_cg0oj59,t3_2085g5,null,1432767076,-3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-3

Then there's some statistical stuff that goes on that accounts for age, location, family status and all that. Technically I believe the minimum income would be different for someone who is young, someone who is old, someone with kids, someone without kids etc. The published figures are probably averages of the different minimums.

Then they uprate that figure every year to account for inflation.

It might not be a perfect figure, but nobody else has done any better research on what the minimum standard is, so it's the best we have. It provides a benchmark as good as any other, if 20% of the population are below the minimum income standard in 2011 but only 10% below in 2014 we are probably doing something right - on the flipside if its gone from 20% to 40% then there's serious questions we need to ask.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"I posted this in another thread, but feel it belongs here, too:

The problem with our defence is that it isn't as much of a problem as everyone says, IMO. Here's why:

""People usually have the go-to statement of ""you've shipped 35 goals, a huge chunk of those (23) away from home, which is the second largest amount in the top 10 and quite ridiculous for the top four"". However, what they leave out is that Arsenal have conceded 28 and Manchester City 27; our much-maligned defence, analysed and criticised every week, has let in only seven more goals than a team (Arsenal) who have been praised for their incredible defensive qualities this season. Sure, 5 of those goals came at our behest, but we're not looking as to which teams have scored those goals, just that Arsenal -- as a collective unit -- shipped that many goals.
Another point to add onto that is that all other teams within the top six have had their strongest, first-choice defence out nearly all season. Depending on your preferences, we've had our ""best"" back four out maybe...three times, if you're that way inclined? Certainly, Toure and Skrtel aren't the best CB pairing, and not many would choose Cissokho on the left over other players, but it's how we've had to deal with an abundance of injuries and that has undoubtedly led to more goals being conceded.

Let me just remind you -- with our second, maybe even third, choice defence, we've only conceded seven more goals than Arsenal. We've only conceded eight more goals than City, who've spent millions upon millions reinforcing their back line. Suddenly, it just doesn't seem that bad because, well, it isn't. Couple that with scoring the most amount of goals in the PL this season at the moment, and it's a much stronger position than anyone within the media is giving us credit for.

Of course, as with most sane LFC fans, I'm not trying to condone our conceding of that many goals just as I'm not attempting to paper over the cracks that are evidently there, but it isn't that damning an indictment when compared rationally and statistically.""

Further than that, most defensive errors this season have come from individual mistakes as opposed to problems with the defensive unit -- Kolo and Skrtel have both had moments of madness and/or weakness, but there aren't many games that I can recall where I've felt that the whole backline has been compromised repeatedly. Constant mistakes like the ones we've seen this season are, mostly, the result of bad luck and the occasional lack of judgement; as with the proverbial buses, they all seem to come at once.

Spurs fan base really like Holtby, but we can't figure out if the management team do. Like others have said, he works hard, is quite versatile (can play left in the 10 or out right) and is creative enough. He puts his heart out there. The main thing that is holding Holtby back at Spurs is how cramped those spots are to fight for. We never actually see him in any form because he doesn't get to play consistently. 

When you consider Eriksen, Siggy, Townsend, Lennon, Chadli, Dembele and arguably Paulinho are trying to cramp up the positions Holtby plays, he barely got a look in from AVB and recently Sherwood. 

His loan out is either a chance to get him some form and sell him on to another club, or, to get him consistent playing time and assess whether we want him to be a regular in our 11. I, however, imagine it is the former. 

I don't see I'm staying at Fulham beyond this season, and would love to see him at Everton. Best of luck negotiating with Levy, even though we didn't pay a big amount for him, we all know how Levy is.

It's really hard to tell if he's still in there by choice or because there's no one else fit and for me he hasn't been nearly as good as people are going on about this season.

I'm not qualified enough to say I'm afraid

&gt; Secondly: I live in a housing association flat on a secure tenancy. Can I get the HA to provide me with a new cooker? I have a feeling the answer is no. Can I at least get them to take the old one away?

I suspect the answer will be no but check your tenancy agreement and even then a polite enquiry to your housing association won't go amiss. I can't see them taking the old cooker away but some places will take your old cooker if you buy your new cooker from them

&gt; Lastly, assuming that I'm buying my own, any recommendations on a new cooker? I prefer gas but I might just go with electric this time because it's cheaper and simpler.

It might not be that simple to switch to an electric cooker, you'll need to change the connection or at least cap the gas connection (something your HA will have to agree to).

The five permanent UN security council members are the main countries armed with nuclear weapons, obviously with a few other nations like India. It could be argued that removing Trident signals to the rest of the world that the UK is scaling back militarily, and therefore that it wants a lesser role in global politics.

The fact that we have a Trident equipped submarine always at sea acts must act as a deterrent (although the fact that the UK's allies also have them probably diminishes this somewhat, but at the same time, if someone invaded the UK, is France going to bomb the aggressor on the UK's behalf? While NATO might have a clause about members going to war, it isn't conclusive). There might not be any sort of imminent threat, I'm sure there isn't, but if one does emerge, it takes a long time to create a brand new nuclear deterrent. 


But do you not think your survey has already been done many times over? There doesn't seem to be anything original in it.

Problem is, ""Good Ole 'Arry"" only gets you so far...he was usually out coached by the top managers, he was regularly stumped on what to do when his plan for the squad wasn't working, he was horrendous with squad rotation and played favorites (Kranky was to rot on the bench week after week, Crouchie could seemingly never be pulled from the lineup regardless of who we played for example), he was all over the place when it came to players he wanted to be brought in (He signed ""The Ginger Pele"" Jamie O'Hara and wanted Charlie Adam, Stewart Downing, Joe Cole and Joey Barton) and then on top of all that once the media started putting him up as the England coach he basically fucked off for 3 months and cost us in the standings and then turned around and bitched that we weren't giving him a new contract.

I like Tim and down the line he could be a good fit for us, however now isn't the time.  The timing is just isn't right for us to take on a new manager with no experience.

We have a small window to capitalize on where the club currently is to transform ourselves from a squad like Everton who are usually in the 5 - 10 slots of the table to a club that is in the hunt for top 4 each year.  We don't have oil money, we don't have a massive worldwide fan base so we can't outspend teams to ensure we always have the top talent. That leaves us with taking the path of getting a top notch manager to lift up the club....seems we have a chance to do that with Van Gaal and we would be unbelievably shortsighted not to take a chance on a world class manager for the club. It is not inconceivable for us to slip very easily down from where we are currently and we need to guard against that and continue to build.

Like i said, I like Tim...but he has a great deal to learn and right now we need a manager who already knows what he is doing.",0,1394642385,null,0,false,0,cg0sopq,t3_208g6r,t1_cg0sopq,t3_208g6r,null,1432769107,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

Well yes and no. Not wanting to knock Lucas but before his injury he was taken out of his DM position in favour of Gerrard (vs. Stoke away) and Lucas played alongside Henderson, ahead of him. It's fair to say that if Allen had been fit and had it not been Stoke away then Allen/Coutinho probably would have started ahead of him in that position.

Because we were in a field at the bottom of a steep track some miles from civilisation we had to find a way to get him to the car (he's 6'3"" and 18 stone, which doesn't help) and then onward to hospital. So we came up with the idea of using the gun as a seat, with two of us holding either end.

Though Holtby seems a likely candidate for sale, I hope his Fulham performances (and that he seemingly gives a shit, something Sherwood clearly values) make them reconsider.

So then, for the two non-attacking CM spots (in either a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3) you have potentially seven players: Paulinho, Bentaleb, Sandro, Holtby, Dembele, Carroll, Capoue.

We've been blessed with a lot of young talent rising the ranks quickly, but they're the exception not the rule. It's not fair to hold every young player up to the standards of Sterling, etc. 

Sometimes late bloomers are the best players in the world, but if a fan base has no patience, they react like rabid dogs when the player is 22 and kick him out, only to see him succeed overseas (or worse, with a rival).

Our administration is doing a great job of bringing in young talent. We will undo all that hard work if we cut them loose before they show their value.

I think Dembele has been a bit lost in his role this season because of Paulinho.  They both want to play in the same area, which has made him look less impressive than last year.  I think Sandro/Dembele/Eriksen is our best midfield, since they essentially all have their role.  Sandro covers the back line and is the furthest back, Dembele goes between the two and gets the ball to Eriksen/our fowards, and Eriksen acts just behind the striker, creating space and movement.  I think it would be foolish to sell Dembele since he has been our most consistent midfielder since we sold Modric.

Technically, sort of, yes. However a policy should be rated (priced) on the highest risk driver so it shouldn't in theory lower the price. But sometimes it does (because insurance has no logic to it) 

The only way this would come back to bite you would be if you made a claim, they were suspicious about the claim so investigated it. In those investigations they find out you lied, they'd void the policy and repudiate the claim leaving you fucked. Would the police be involved? Very unlikely unless you were part of a huge fraud.

For that reason I don't think the boss will see Lucas coming back as the perfect fix for the defence and I think he'll stick with Gerrard because he prefers to have a playmaker in there than an out and out DM. I think he also values Gerrard's sheer will to win hugely and playing him deep lets us press properly.

As an external observer I don't hate Israel for its position, its completely understandable given the countries that surround it and its recent history of warfare with them, nor do I hate the Muslims for theirs as their position is understandable as well, but what can you do? 

There are now children on both sides that were born there, call it home and it should be their right to. However the ruling classes of both of these societies have failed to find a solution, neither the Democratic Israeli nor the Dictatorial or questionably Democratic Muslim. Both of these societies have engaged in ethically questionable and antagonising practices including warfare, explosive attacks in civilian areas (mortar, rocket, suicide), somewhat indiscriminate bombing runs, assassinations of civilians, the building of a freaking massive wall.  

How else would you imagine an external third party would view this fight at this point? Sure I can imagine myself being a supporter of Israel at the start but now, in 2014? If I'm going to be truly objective then I can't choose one side over the other.

.... and yea I'll happily write Pacifist Propaganda because I would assume that the alternative solution is either exile or genocide, both of which require a war of terrifying proportions.

Coutinho has been stepping up his defensive pressure in recent games and what he adds offensively is something I feel a lot of people are overlooking. 

Coutinho has had a few bad games, but in recent games he's been very good. smart defensive positioning and high work rate when pressing. With him on the field we have the added benefit of a ball carrier. Hendo, Gerrard and Lucas cannot provide this threat as none of them are as comfortable with the ball at their feet. Add to that his vision and he's a must-have. 

If anything, I see Sterling being benched in favor of Allen. Sterling used as an impact sub (swap with coutinho) and the possibility of Lucas coming on for either Allen or Gerrard or one of the strikers (to close a match)",0,1394649174,null,0,false,0,cg0w7ff,t3_208kss,t1_cg0w7ff,t3_208kss,null,1432770761,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

It's not until he's reached  SPAD is he even considered for one of them directorship boondoggles (for which he was recommended by his future mother-in-law), before jumping ship on selection to the candidate's list.

What, then, is his qualification to earn £120k a year? As far as I can tell, his position is entirely dependent on spending a chunk of his career working within the party machine along with a smattering of family connections.

We are in the era of the professional politician who's ambition to do politics means that they are wholly unsuitable to do any other work. Whilst your assertion for 'can earn double the MP salary in private sector' might apply to those standing as a second career, the current crop would only do so based on their political careers to date.

Anyone who is going to make use of one of these weapons isn't going to be a country, we won't have a target to retaliate against without being as bad as the people who made the first move. 

- Nuclear weapons are useless to ""retaliate"" in most cases.


Our country is relatively small (in terms of land) in comparison to the majority of nuclear powers. If a nuclear weapon were to hit the UK, our country would suffer a lot more than many of the others. We essentially have 1 or 2 cities that hold a large amount of our population. In the worst case scenario, the percentage of population affected by the weapon would be huge. We should use this as a motivation to removing the weapon from the table across the board.

- We as a country would be safer in a decommissioned world, much safer than a world with a proliferation of nuclear weapons.

In the end, just because this weapon exists doesn't mean that we should have one. The financial arguments are quite compelling, also.

&gt;(1)A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and “thief” and “steal” shall be construed accordingly.

&gt;3“Appropriates”.

&gt;(1)Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.

&gt;(1)Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest).

Hi /u/vbub and /u/dave3k. Thanks for letting us know about this reddit thread as we are happy to help with issues transparently. We are a very small team and recently been busy with Texas BTC conference and several incubator opportunities, so I apologize for more responsive support. The reddit gold and bitcoin tips are not bribes, but a thanks for testing our service as some of the first non-US users, providing **valuable** feedback, and a public way to show that we are committed to transparency and incentivize open discussions about our service. (And the mention notification to ensure you both receive the message)

&gt; some hours since sending the item and I've heard nothing on their end. I was number 57 in the queue, perhaps no support on sundays?

I looked at 57 but I believe you're referring to  58. I personally handled another one of your support tickets about the same issue, and since we are new with zendesk, we might have not merged the tickets properly. 

As a buyer, we will not release the BTC until the spender has confirmed the shipment. I received that confirmation just now which led me here. 

Because every Amazon domain has its quirks and Amazon intentionally makes it difficult for parsers, there are still occasional problems that come up. Even more so since we just released the updated for international customers. 

Since you both are clearly honest users (thankfully), the easiest way to handle this situation now is for me to email the spender (/u/dave3k iirc) the deposit address and proper amount of the buyer (/u/vbub). This is because there is no way (yet) to verify your the same people as the ones on Purse.IO. 

Regarding the problem that caused the bug to occur, we think we have identified it and currently testing. If either of you would be okay with a brief skype chat to discuss what exactly happened, we might be able to gain higher levels insight to make our app more robust. 

Our current user base is a small but loyal group of US users. They tend to use the service repeatedly and provide Amazing feedback that allow us to continually improve the service. A similar group of users in UK would provide tremendous value to us. 

Everyone who we spoke to about this service understands its novelty and value proposition for our customers. Our goal is to refine the service in such a way (including dedicated support staff) that when we are ready to scale, we are able to handle it. Feedback from early adopters like yourselves are an integral part of that process. 

I will go send that email today after I get to the ""office.""

But that's OK when we play him in a deep, static role--he sits in front (or sometimes drops back between) the CBs, distributes the ball, etc, while the midfielders in front of him press and advance the play. 

If you bring Lucas in but keep Gerrard, you have to decide how to play. Do you put Lucas at DM? Then Gerrard, playing further up, is a liability if you want to press as a unit and have him track back. Do you play Gerrard in a more static role, but higher up than Lucas, while having Lucas do more pressing work? I'm not sure if that would work at all tbh. Maybe you play Lucas a bit further up as a bit more of an advanced DM while playing Gerrard in the deeper role, but then you're not getting as much attacking play out of Lucas (unless he improves his forward play).

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I think what the article fails to fully hit on the head is that our crossing has likely declined because the quality of our crosses is exceedingly poor. The amount of times Walker, Lennon or Rose attempt to cross into the box but either hit the first defender or find no one is galling.

Possibly for this reason it's that Sherwood has opted to play more through the centre.  It's not working though.

We don't have enough creativity and penetration in the middle, even with Eriksen playing.  Players aren't getting into holes between the lines, and therefore our attack is always hugely separated from our midfield.  Teams are very happy to sit deep against us, knowing that we can't pass through them, and don't have the kind of rotating, one-touch passing moves that can disrupt and unlock a packed defence.

Despite the crossing quality, I feel like at this point in time we have to use the wings more, similar to how Utd played under Ferguson.  Get it wide quickly to some pace men, have an overlapping fullback, and look to get in behind the defensive line.  We need to work on crossing and crossing decision making (particularly Walker and Lennon), and playing two strikers actually gives us more things to aim at in the box.  The problem with playing Adebayor all alone is that too often he needs to drop very deep into midfield to find service, so that at the point we are in a crossing position, he's not in the right spot in the box.

Ultimately, Tim needs to pick an attacking methodology and stick to it.  I find it incredible that this far into the season, we don't have an obvious first choice XI.  Nearly every other club - even the big ones with huge squads - have that.  There's no way we'll find understanding and fluidity in attack when our line up changes nearly every match.",0,1394661163,null,0,false,0,cg12iue,t3_207q8p,t1_cg12iue,t3_207q8p,null,1432773803,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Possibly, but with his six figure salary he was earning more than enough to own the property. It maybe a small thing, but council properties are designed for those that truly need them.

Essentially they are rated 1-5 (extremely common in industry) and one of the performance metrics that managers seem to like to use is number of sanctions, with the implication that they should be sanctioning people.

So the wrong behaviour is driven by ineffective middle managers, and high end managers don't control it (or are complicit by letting it slip by) and the government are indirectly responsible for creating a system which allows it without seemingly taking any action to control it.

The message of this post by Degriz is great - appeal, appeal, appeal. It's terrible that (seemingly) only 2% appeal. If the figure was over 50% there would be no arbitrary sanctioning going on.

* Barcelona's pace pushed us beyond our comfort zone over and over again. We looked scrappy trying to react at time. We're physical, but not fast.
* They also knew how to kill our pace and get back when they felt we were a threat: they'd commit a foul big enough for a free kick, small enough to not risk a card. 

  21 fouls in that game by Barcelona (one every 4 minutes). 

  Just a little nip, and whilst we set up the free kick - even if we took it very quickly - it would just give them the 3-5 seconds they needed to get a few more players back
* We were lucky to not be 2-0 down at HT
* The ref was shocking on several occasions
* I think we should have brought Negredo on earlier
* We didn't want to win by the end of it. What kind of game would we have cobbled together for a quarter final with so many of our better players unable to play and the manager sat with the directors?

So, on to the real focus. We need to absolutely destroy everybody we encounter from hereon in in the league.

After accepting an order to buy ""Ok i'll take this"" and accepting, the next process gives me some instructions and a link to click.

on clicking it takes me to amazon.com, which would be incorrect as the items in the wishlist were only available on the .co.uk version. to get around this I used chromes ability to edit and changed the post url to read .co.uk instead.

This got me as far as being able to purchase the item and send it to the correct address, i took the order number and pasted it in the box provided on purse.io

Now i would be making an assumption but when the website tried to check it would of been looking at the .com site again rather than .co.uk, either way it entered into the message histroy that i have purchased the item, though I still had a message coming up that I had not yet purchased it.

I tried a few times to put the order number in again every time it failed but still said in the message history that I had.

Eventually the timer expired and The guy on the other end took the order off i believe.

Marin had 6 BPL appearances for the whole season, in which he scored 1 goal. I tried to find the minutes played but I couldn't, but I'm pretty sure most of those 6 appearances came from substitutions in the last 10 minutes.

I watched Marin play last season and he was pretty exciting to watch, I remember him pretty well for one game in fact when he came on in the 85th minute or so and nearly scored 3 times, and you have the cheek to tell me he's a poor player?

Council housing is a form of social welfare, which theoretically is designed for those that need the help. Imagine the reverse situation, in which lots of wealthy people, people that can afford to buy their own home or to rent at market rates, instead choose to live in subsidised council houses. That means the poor in society have nowhere to live. There are no council houses and these people are unable to afford private sector rates. The result is outrage at what is essentially people taking a benefit that is not designed for them.

They do this to protect you from fraud. The bank's systems spotted what seemed to be an unusual transaction based on your past behaviour, and got in touch with you to confirm that it's legit.

This happens to me from time to time with NatWest. As soon as it does, the phone rings, I confirm it was me, and off I go. It's nice knowing the bank is being proactive in protecting my account.

True but what about those who didn't work for TFL, where they disadvantaged by the actions?

If there isn't an improvement in efficency, then there can only be a transfer of wealth, as TFL is a tax payer subsidised entity, used by people who don't have a choice (monopoly) then I would suggest it comes at the expense of those who require the services.  If you applied that logic to each worker who produces anything that is consumed by any other worker, we can be no better off, it's a zero-sum game.  All you can do is have some form of wealth transfer.

The only way to make things better for everyone is to have more efficiency.

The problem with the argument of wealth transfer, is it ignores the in-elasticity of much of the supply that creates the inequality in our society, if the richest person earned £1M per year, and we suddenly gave everyone £1M per year, not that much would change, unless the supplies were increased inline, whilst for somethings this is possible for many things, this isn't.

true,Snay,null,null,"Optician here, my 2p. Laser eye surgery is a big decision, and it's great that you're doing your research on it. It is generally considered to be safe, but there are some risks involved, as with any surgical procedure. I would consider the who more important than the where, that is to say a lot of it is about the surgeon you see. I would always want to be able to meet the surgeon before the procedure to discuss your case, and any difficulties or risks involved. Don't be shy about asking them how many procedures they've done, what their success rate is and whether they are a member of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. 

If you're looking for a recommendation, I'd look into Optegra in Manchester. They're not the cheapest (about £2000 per eye, including wavefront aberrometry) but I've heard very good things about their surgeons and follow up care. 

Other options in Liverpool are Ultralase, again, I've heard good things, no significant problems or complaints. There's optical express in Liverpool One, which I've had mixed reports about, surgery is mostly okay, but the sales pitch can be a bit pushy and the aftercare can leave something to be desired. Finally there is the Spire. I have a ten foot bargepole with a shitty knife on the end if you're interested.

Most places will give a free consultation, so I wouldn't settle on the first place you visit. Try and find a surgeon you feel comfortable, make sure you know exactly what is and isn't included in the price (aftercare appointments, drugs and drops, top up procedures, etc), and that you are definitly happy with the type of surgery on offer, and that you understand the alternatives.

Given the fact that people are sent to jail for not handing over their passwords now, I imagine they have the ability to circumvent conventional cryptographic methods. [There are already commercial quantum computers if you have the money](http://www.dwavesys.com/quantum-computing) so it wouldn't be surprising if such technology has been available to intelligence agencies for a while.


Aside: [How current cryptography works](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7kEpw1tn50). Quantum computers are useful because they can [solve factorization problems extremely quickly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm). A completely naive method to factorize a number takes O( n^2 ) checks, for each number less than n, you multiply it by another number less than n and see if you get n as a result. Using Shor's algorithm requires  O( (log n)^3 ) checks. Now lets assume you're using a 1028-bit  number (a number comprised of 2^1028 binary digits) to encrypt your data like most computers currently do.

O( ( 2^1028 )^2 ) =

The Tianhe-1A, one of the fastest super computers in the world can perform around 2.5 petaflops (a petaflop is a thousand trillion floating point operations per second). Now pretending that 1 floating point operation is equivalent to checking if a number is a prime factor (note: it will definitely take more), then solving it the O( n^2 ) way would take approximately:

So your personal data would be safe until the literal end of the universe against conventional computers. But the 361,789,307 of a quantum computer is feasible. Assuming that a quantum computer can do 1000 of those checks a second (compared to 100,000,000,000 instructions per second of a single intel I7 desktop processor), then you can expect to find an encryption key in a matter of days. If they can do 10,000 per second, you're looking at hours per key, 100,000 then minutes. If they operate at the speed of an I7 (which they probably don't), then they can crack 276 keys per second.

The short of it is essentially if you don't want people to know what you're sharing, don't share it via the internet. (note: that includes tor which is dependent on this technology as well).",0,1394667646,null,0,false,0,cg15mlo,t3_2099ov,t1_cg15mlo,t3_2099ov,null,1432775264,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1
