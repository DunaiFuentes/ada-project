I like Lallana but without a doubt Fabregas is the more quality player. Also, the English angle doesn't really work in this case because we are already stacked with English talent.

true,willed1234,null,null,"I've only ever rented through a letting agent (often the exact same business as an estate agent) but there are also private landlords which may work slightly differently. This is my experience. 

You go onto the letting agency's website (or into their office) and find a house that you like the look of. You then call them up and arrange a viewing. You turn up at the decided time at the house and get shown around. 

If you decide you want the house, you pay a smallish deposit (which they'll keep as an 'admin' fee) and they take the house of the market. You will then get sent a contract to look over. This will be a huge document explaining that in every possible situation and no matter what happens, you will end up getting screwed at the end of it.

If you agree with the contract, you arrange a time when you can go to sign it. At this point you also pay your damages deposit (which no matter how careful you are, you will never get all of it back). The deposit is usually the equivalent of one months rent. It has to be declared in some special way by the landlord so that they can't spend it before they're meant to give it back at the end of your contract. Some people may also want rent paid at this time in the form of forward dated cheques so they can just cash them each time rent is due. 

Once all this is done and you're considerably poorer than when you started, you just need to wait until the date your contract starts and then you're all set to move in. 

Edit - in terms of interviews, I've never had one, but know some people have when renting from a private landlord. I think the interview they had was just more of a quick once over to check they weren't the type of people to trash the place rather than a formal thing. Often letting agents will specify what type of people they want, eg professionals or students or whatever but other than that, they've never seemed to care who you are.

Wouldn't it be more productive to campaign for more new shows with female protagonists, or more new shows with ensemble casts that include strong female characters, than trying to say that decisions made 51 years ago mean that someone writing the show today is sexist? The Doctor is male and is *very much* the center of the show, so there's *never* going to be a character who spends a significant amount of their time talking about things that don't involve The Doctor.

Again, back to my original point--Moffat's female characters are not weak because they are female, they are weak because *all of Moffat's characters* are weak, other than the Doctor. This study basically removes the female characters from the reality of the show's entirety, and only presents their situation without consideration for environment. That's like going to a workplace and saying, ""All the women here make 20 percent less than the national average, therefore this workplace is sexist,"" without noticing that the men at the same workplace also were making 20 percent less.

true,revolverzanbolt,null,null,"&gt; Right... but The Doctor isn't human either. The choice make the character male was made 51 years ago. Now you're basically arguing that by simply *not changing the character to be female*, Moffat is exhibiting sexism.

He doesn't need to make the doctor female, he just needs to make female characters independently relevant to the story. And don't act like these things are impossible to change: Elementary wasn't as good as Sherlock in a lot of ways, but having Lucy Liu play Watson was a great choice. When Bryan Fuller adapted Hannibal, he made a bunch of the male book characters women, and it worked fine. 

&gt; Wouldn't it be more productive to campaign for more new shows with female protagonists, or more new shows with ensemble casts that include strong female characters, than trying to say that decisions made 51 years ago mean that someone writing today is sexist. 

New shows with women protagonists would be good as well. But shows don't get a pass on sexism because they're continuing trends from the past. Just because Star Wars only has one female character, doesn't mean the new films have to follow suit. 

&gt; The Doctor is male and is *very much* the center of the show, so there's *never* going to be a character who spends a significant amount of their time talking about things that don't involve The Doctor.

RTD managed to do it almost 90% of the time. That's pretty far away from never. 

&gt; Again, back to my original point--Moffat's female characters are not weak because they are female, they are weak because *all of Moffat's characters* are weak, other than the Doctor. 

It's not just their lack of capability that's the problem. It's the fact that he only knows how to write one female character, over and over again.

&gt; This study basically removes the female characters from the reality of the show's entirety, and only presents their situation without consideration for environment. That's like going to a workplace and saying, ""All the women here make 20 percent less than the national average, therefore this workplace is sexist,"" without noticing that the men at the same workplace also were making 20 percent less.

Except this isn't just a one time thing, unique to the show. To add to your analogy, if one company promoted a man to CEO, that'd be fine. If CEO's are overwhelmingly male, than that's a problem. No one's suggesting to cancel the show (or whatever the metaphorical equivalent would be for the company) but maybe they could put a little effort into diversity programs or offer some management advancement programs for their female staff.

This isn't even a problem Moffat keeps uniquely to Doctor Who. Sherlock's got a similar a problem.

&gt; If they made a River Song show, and most of the male characters spent all their time talking about things that had to do with you, I would not try to label that as sexism against men, yet by your reasoning, I should.

*If* they made a show about River Song, that had less than 2 male characters who never talked to each other about something other than a woman, that show would be a unique example. And like I said, unique examples of this type of thing are fine by themselves. Y: the Last Man fails the reverse Bechdel most of the time, and that's fine because it's justified. I Am Legend fails the Bechdel, and it makes sense. It's when the majority of shows and movies fail that we have a problem.

---

&gt;From the 1340s to the 19th century, excluding only two brief intervals in the 1360s and the 1420s, the kings and queens of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England) (and, later, of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain)) also claimed the [throne of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_monarchs). The claim dates from [Edward III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England), who claimed the French throne in 1340 as the maternal nephew of the late king. Edward and his heirs fought the [Hundred Years War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years_War) to enforce this claim, and were briefly successful in the 1420s under [Henry V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England) and [Henry VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England), but the [Capetians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Capet) were ultimately victorious and retained *de facto* control of France. Despite this, English and British monarchs continued to prominently include the words ""of France"" among the realms listed in their titles and styles, and the French [fleur-de-lys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur-de-lys) were included in the royal arms. This continued until 1801, by which time France had no monarch, having become a [republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_First_Republic).

&gt;Provides evidence that the mentally ill man was unconnected to misogynistic culture. 'Misogynistic' community highlighted the fact that having somewhere to talk about troubling feelings is healthier than letting them fester in isolation

This writer is decrying a community which could have helped him process his extreme views and avoid the situation which occurred. I don't think ignoring mental health issues and preventing people from seeking support, however unpleasant their opinions are, could ever be a good thing. The same could be said for stepping outside of any echo chamber of opinion.

The only legitimate point she makes in the entire article is where she highlights the culture of being 'owed' sex. Given that the guy had a a plethora of mental illnesses, as well as being bullied by people from various internet forums, meant that his perspective was far askew from what is actually normal. Trying to tie this event in any way to feminism only highlights how much damage militant feminism has done to perceptions of male and female relationships portrayed in the media. It's not a feminism of equality but of fear, subjugation and hatred, which is never going to be a positive thing.

Assuming you'll be using the train station to get home at various points, it's one of the closest halls to there, and it's equidistant between there and uni.

There are probably more clubs near there (Motion, Syndicate, O2, Thekla, Blue Mountain etc.) than the other halls (apart from Hawthorns), and you'll always be walking downhill after a night out ;) The walk to uni is doable in about 15-20 minutes, depending on how fast you walk, and the other main student clubs are just up park street, about the same distance as from uni.

Then there's shopping and other stuff apart from clubs, everything is so much closer to the city centre residences. I was worried I'd be in some small student house with only a few people when I first got the accommodation, but there were about 200 of us in the same building.

Is that true? I always thought /r/TheRedPill was about male self-improvement and developing more intuitive social skills. I'm generally inclined to question the validity of these sexism articles you find in the guardian. To me a lot of it is fuelled by a few key factors, the main one being the internet giving rise to a more fractured, atomised society, giving people an incredibly easy platform to surround yourself with people that share your exact worldview, and all the resulting hubris that comes with that. Reddit being an example of this, Twitter and Facebook too. Another factor is the stratospheric rise in the use of social media amongst people in their 20s and 30s. It fuels peoples narcissism and competitiveness amongst their peers. It then turns into a sort of competition as to who has the most 'shocking' experience of sexism, similar to how men one-up each other when they tell stories and exchange banter. It affects peoples psychology in a rather nuanced, indirect way. I do wonder whether these sexism 'campaigners' would refuse a job promotion that was offered to them based mainly on their attractiveness and youth.

Furthermore, one of the main reasons i'm inclined to question these anecdotes is that we live in Britain, one of the egalitarian and tolerant societies in the world. It's one of better countries in the world i'd feel pretty safe if my girlfriend was out in public unaccompanied. I've been to Asia and the Mid East and women there face a much tougher struggle.

The worst thing you can do is stop because you can't afford more lessons. It's all about keeping the momentum going. Considering how low loan rates are now, I'd borrow a grand and just blitz it, 4-6 hours a week.

Not allowing citizens to leave a state - even temporarily - seems to be a gross violation of the rights of free human beings to, well, move freely. It is significantly worse than the policy of preventing individuals from entering a country based on criminal conviction (which is already rare in a global context), because it makes that decision on behalf of the rest of the world. Brazil, or anywhere, might be happy to have them. However, the United Kingdom has decided on behalf of the world - and on behalf of those human beings - where they may not go.

The fact that they are hooligans does not make it any more acceptable to me. In many ways, it compounds the wrong. This is because the people who are penalized are *already* a marginalized group within society. The further marginalization and exclusion of individuals with a criminal history perpetuates the cycle of criminality. It is a shame that legislators - even individuals working in a law enforcement capacity - are not more familiar with evidence-based criminal justice practices. It is almost as if they are *trying* to create a social mileu that will produce more crime in the long run.

I would also keep this in mind about the football - the slums in Brazil are on fire with hatred for the cup. There is a slogan being chanted in the favelas right now: ""there will be no cup."" There is anti-cup graffiti all over the place. They're furious about how the government has violently cleared entire neighborhoods to ""clean up"" the image of Brazil, as well as how the state has taxed and redirected taxation spent on social services to fund a sports game. 

That kept in mind - that many Brazilian locals are completely opposed to the cup and are being oppressed by a corrupt state *specifically due to the world cup* - I find it more troubling. The United Kingdom has facilitated this with its endorsement of the game. Yet, they aren't focused on state collusion with corporate interests at the cost of human lives in Brazil. They're concerned with helping to sanitize the image of the cup by preventing a handful of tourists from visiting.

&gt;

&gt;__Clevedon Pier__ is a seaside [pier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier) in the town of [Clevedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clevedon), Somerset, England on the east shoreof the [Severn Estuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Estuary). It has been described by [Sir John Betjeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Betjeman), as ""the most beautiful pier in England"" and was designated a Grade I [listed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building) in 2001. 

&gt;The pier was built during the 1860s to attract tourists and provide a ferry port for rail passengers to [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales). The pier is 312 m (1,024 ft) long and consists of eight spans supported by steel rails covered by wooden decking, with a pavilion on the pier head.

&gt;The pier opened in 1869 and served as an embarkation point for [paddle steamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_steamer) excursions for almost exactly 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund raising and heritage grants allowed the pier to be dismantled for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the [National Piers Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Piers_Society), and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now, once again, offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.

true,Norvaldov,lfc68,,"If I've understood correctly, Bournemouth are entitled to 25% of any Lallana transfer fee. Assuming I'm not completely hopeless at low level math (a pretty big assumption, mind you):

With Lallana at £25m and Lambert at £4m, that nets the Saints £22.75m. 

With Lallana at £20m and Lambert at £9m, that nets them £24m.

Would this make a significant difference? On a slightly unrelated note, I dont get Soton's valuation. Bournemouth's clause is completely irrelevant to Lallana's market value. I get that they want as much money as possible, and that a player ultimately ends up being worth what someone is willing to pay for him. But with a single PL season below his belt, albeit a very good one, I dont think he commands a fee above £20m, and our reported £25m is a very good offer for him.

At any rate, it'll be interesting to see how the Lallana situation progresses. I do rate him and think he'd fit in here, but I personally don't see anyone paying more than £25m for him.

true,xeno9,null,null,"&gt;Significantly, the report’s authors admitted they could not give a full picture of the impact of immigration on the job market because they had not considered some “major changes”, such as the EU accession of Poland and seven other eastern European countries in 2004.

So the massive influx of Polish workers (and those of 7 other countries who became EU members in 2004 including Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia etc) weren't even included in their analysis of EU nationals. I would suggest that these countries make up a large portion of the lower skilled economic migrants that have entered Britain in recent years. Throwing water on your ""EU nationals cause no displacement"" theory.

Besides this is just one (obviously limited) study, and even it clearly shows that immigration affects British workers in tough economic times.



[Here's another study] (http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/10/non-eu-immigration-unemployment) summarized by the left leaning Guardian, which strongly supports my claim. Here's a few choice excerpts:

&gt;for every extra 100 non-European migrants who come to Britain, 23 fewer British residents are employed.

Hardly negligible effects we're talking about here...

&gt;migration has [...] lowered wage rates at the bottom of the pay scale.

Again affecting lower paid, lower skilled vulnerable Brits more than any other group, and then we wonder why they have become anti-immigration...

So again, the evidence is there, (to be honest the idea that people compete for low skilled, non-specialist jobs should be common sense anyway) and all I'm saying is that perhaps we owe the working class to include this kind of thing in serious debate, instead of simply spouting the same ad hominem nonsense: ""racists, Nazis, uneducated scum"" etc etc etc",0,1401614061,null,0,1401614347,0,chwa5le,t3_26qeee,t1_chwa5le,t1_chw9gfr,null,1434044006,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,cass210,,Gonnae no' mess up the testers?,"Firstly, I'd describe my skin as normal, with an oily t-zone developing throughout the day.

My routine at the moment:

In the morning, I splash my face with water in the shower and then put some moisturiser on afterwards.  I only cleanse if I'm feeling a bit grimy.

In the evening, I first take off my makeup with wipes.  Currently these are the vitamin e wipes from Superdrug, but I'm not particularly fussy with wipes.  My favourites are probably the Huggies sensitive wipes (yellow packet).  I also use eye makeup remover, currently the Nivea double action one.  

Next is cleansing.  I'm currently on the Lacura (Aldi) Gel cleanser, which is a lovely product.  Next time I run out of cleanser, I'm going to buy the Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash as it's reccommended on /r/skincareaddiction.  My skin doesn't tend to react to a lot of products so I'm pretty easy on switching products.  

I use toner...for now.  Apparently it's a bit useless.  I'm just using it until I run out.

Next is exfoliation.  I'm trying to find a suitable AHA on the High St, which there appear to be very little choice.  I've bought the Soap and Glory AHA scrub but it is not what I expected.  For one, I think there is mint in it, which I don't like the feel of on my skin.  Secondly, there seems small, rough particles which I wasn't expecting in a chemical exfoliation product.  My skin has been reacting to it due to how harsh it is, I've decided to use it every other day now, which my skin seems to like better.  I will not repurchase this, think I'll go for the Nip &amp; Fab glycolic acid pads next.

Then, I moisturise.  The one I use morning and night is Oilatums Natural Repair Face Cream.  My face is very soft, but I'm not sure if it's worth the £7.50 price tag.  I've seen some users enjoy the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Pink Grapefruit moisturiser, so that's my next big try in moisturiser.

My routine ends there, but if I require a treatment for spots I use Sudocrem.  If you haven't bought this stuff already, DO IT.  I'd suggest buying it in one of the big 4 supermarkets as they do the giant tubs you don't see on the high street.

Anyway, come withdrawal time, they couldn't confirm my ID, so they demanded a scan of my passport, or driver's license. I looked up their Data Protection policies, and they were basically just pish, with disclaimers everywhere. I wrote to them explaining, in very firm terms, that I would absolutely not be sending a scan of my sensitive government identity documents to an organisation who could not guarantee any safe handling of my data, and demanded my money.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Because it comes out of customers pockets. Who votes to pay more for things?

Isn't that the platform of many left wing people, when they believe they can shift the cost to someone else?

For instance corporation tax, it has to be paid by someone, legal entities ultimately shouldn't bother being taxed, it's the people that you want to tax, as legal entities are just useful simple ways of grouping people together in certain manners.

Take Amazon, I love their customer service, it's simply the best out there by a long shot.  

""Hi, my kindle died and I'm catching a flight tomorrow""

""where are you going sir, what time do you leave for your flight?""

""7pm, I'm going to Saigon""

""ok sir, it takes 5 days sadly to Saigon, so we'll have a replacement for you by 10pm tonight, should give you plenty of time to charge it before your flight, if you aren't going to be home, I'll have it delivered to the locker just down the street"".

I mean wow.  That's why I use Amazon a lot.  When I look at people who criticise them for paying no CT, I just don't understand how they come up with their numbers, if you listen to any of Bezos's presentations, they operate a business model which is about having razor thing margins.  So when people complain they are dodging tax, by looking at gross revenue, I fear that is incredibly disingenuous as the international entity doesn't have that level of earnings.  (this is contery to starbucks who do!).

One thing they don't doge is the VAT!   Which is paid directly by us.  But what happens if we put some 'turnover tax' on Amazon, (also somehow, no idea how this would be legal in EU rules).  Well if we look at their EPS or other measures we can see that investors are certainly not getting rich from amazon.  So odds are prices would have to rise.

So I can't understand why people think they won't end up paying more if the companies providing services they use, pay more tax.  There are some exceptions, in companies that have very high margins, but it's very difficult to pick out which ones those are in a manner that is simple and not open to wide scale abuse.  If you tried to put a punitive tax on Starbucks, I worry about the collateral damage it would inflict.",0,1401617225,null,0,false,0,chwalmn,t3_26zrzz,t1_chwalmn,t1_chwafrm,null,1434044215,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The private sector has given up on the unions; the membership amongst the private sector is still very low compared to what it would need to be for better support.  I've seen campaigns run where people just don't bother to join, when we get wind of something odd going on.  Big campaigns to help show people their rights at work are under threat, but the majority just don't bother.

Then, three months later when the company starts shedding people, changing terms, freezing wages, trumping up disciplinary meetings just to get rid of a few more people, we get a flurry of people joining, who re then pissed off because we can't help them, because they weren't members before the situation occurred - which of course just fuels the 'union is shit it won't help me when i need it' quotes *sighs*.

These things are sort of hard to come by at £25m, especially the leadership quality. 

When people say Shaqiri is a much better option because he will become ""world class"", I think fair enough, but Lallana is a safer bet and for me brings many positives over Shaqiri, while Shaqiri beats him pretty much on potential and maybe cost.

The bank didn't think it was a sound move, that he could be charging more rent and with greater security by letting to someone else.  He told the bank where to go.

Peter Robinson said he'd only Muslims to 'go to the shops' for him... so, he sees them as servants? He gives them the same amount of trust that you'd give a child? How *fucking dare he* be so condescending and patronising to an *entire race* of people? In fact, not even an entire race... Islamic offshoots span *multiple races*... it accounts for 1.6 billion people in the world (*almost a quarter of the worlds population*), it is one of the largest growing religions worldwide.

People in their right mind don't want Northern Ireland painted as right-wing hate mongering state. His silence is just cowardice, and needs to be punished.

As for the 'only those who follow *sharia law*' excuse. That is an amazingly feeble excuse that won't stand up to anyone at all who knows anything about it.

*Sharia law* encompasses:

* Economic laws - e.g. *All muslims must pay zakat, a 'national insurance' so to speak, that goes to the poor in the community. The amount is based on the wealth of the individual.*

* Dietary laws - e.g. *The month of Ramadan, Muslims have to fast between sunrise and sunset.*

* Theological obligation - e.g. *Muslims must travel to one of their holy sites at least once in their lifetime.*

* Sharia customs - e.g. *Eating with the right hand, saying 'bismillah' before eating/drinking. Saying ""As-Salaam Alaikum"" (peace be upon you) when meeting someone. And basic hygienic customs.*

* Dress code - *The covering of a females face etc, is not actually required. Rather it is the choice of the scholars in the local muslim community; some see it as mandatory, others do not. Dress code applies to both men and women, and is meant so that they do not see each other as only sexual objects.*

* Non-Muslim status - e.g. *Classical Sharia law incorporates religious laws and courts of Jews, Christians and Hindus, and has been known to also incorporate Buddhist laws and courts.*


*Furthermore*, if Peter Robinson uses the 'only the terrorist' excuse, that is equally filmsy. I'll assume he's refering to Al-Qaeda, yes?

Al-Qaeda (translation: The Base) is hundreds (perhaps thousands) of different groups. First and foremost:
**They are ALL fighting for different things.**

**Most** are fighting to get the US army out of their country, or to stop influencing or interfereing in their countries politics. The same thing has happened here with the British Government, in the south, in South America with the US. In the US with the British Government. In the Basque country with the Spanish Government... countless times over in history. The majority of combatants in these types of wars are *not* classed as terrorist.

As with any armed groups, there are the more extreme combatants, and there are some fighting under some warped, imperialistic version of sharia law that *they themselves* have came up with. These men and women are in the absolute minority.

**Branding 1.6 billion people worldwide as only trustworthy enough to go and get you a mars bar in the shop is NEVER right**

true,DioSoze,null,null,"I think the entire focus on ""punishment"" as a goal is why the UK and US criminal justice systems are so fundamentally broken. Prison, supervision, ASBOs, probation, etc. keep people in the system. They create additional obstacles and points of stress for individuals to overcome - individuals who are the most vulnerable to offending.

You can note that, throughout this thread, the talking points can be summed up as ""they are criminals"" and ""they deserve it."" These are antiquated concepts that, despite still being a part of the modern criminal justice system, have been repudiated by criminal justice research.

If you create an individual who is a ""criminal"" and treat them as a criminal class - they will reoffend. They will internalize that role. Systems that have shifted away from punitive justice to rehabilitative justice have created the opposite effect. The paradigm of what a criminal ""deserves"" is abandoned. Instead, the law focuses on what *works* to reintegrate an individual into society. And many of the antiquated methods of punishment don't line up here. They are, in fact, oppressive. This isn't an off the wall opinion - it's the way criminal justice as a field has been leaning for the last 10-15 years.

Instead of creating the perpetual criminal - the individual who is hindered with a modern scarlet letter - effective models focus on the crime, restoration and rehabilitation. A person is not a ""criminal,"" but a person who at some point in the past committed a crime. After said rehabilitation is finished they are restored, as an equal, into society.

Lallana brings the qualities of leadership, versatility and experience in the lower leagues, and he's had success in the Prem. He's also got great tracking back and I think will work really well with Rodgers. 

Sure the home-grown talent tag has added extra money to Lallana's bid, not denying that, but don't you think Shaqiri's ""exotic winger"" sticker has led many to overrate him? Will he really be world class?

To be honest I really want both if possible (who doesn't lol) as I do believe Shaqiri will be a very good winger in the future but for 25m we are getting a captain, someone who can play on the wings and in the centre with ease, a success in the PL last season and a great finisher to boot.

And that's fine. We all have our opinions and we're all entitled to voice them on here. Hell, I wouldn't be against signing him for 25m at all -- I think he'd be an amazing addition to the squad and his versatility would play right into Rodgers' tactics -- but I do think that, if he was from any other country, even on the back of last season's success, clubs would not be battling it out over 25m for him. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but it's my honest opinion and I won't pretend that it's not. 

The Southampton fans I've seen on /r/soccer were generally surprised that we'd bid 25m and that the club is ""reportedly"" holding out for 30m for him. Yes, he's their captain and he's had a fantastic season, but even they understand that a few million has been added on to A) hopefully put clubs off and keep him at the club and B) cash-in on his English status. It's like if someone came in and we demanded 35m for Sterling; you'd be impressed by our resolve, but you'd think that we've added a fair amount on to try and keep him and put others off. 

As for Shaqiri, he might not be world-class ever, but he looks like, with some guidance, he'd be a really great winger to have. He might be overrated somewhat because of his affiliation with Bayern (who often overhype their younger players) but I don't think their reported asking price of 20m is too much whatsoever.

true,Wilhelm_IV,null,null,"Personally, I get very defensive about Torres - and here is why:

If you go back and watch the goals he scored in his first season at Liverpool you will notice 2 things: 1) He has more pace than he does today and 2) He gets amazing service from Gerrard and Alonso with the other teams totally unprepared.

This led to him scoring a ton of goals and people saying he was a top 5 striker - but I don't think he was. I think he was overrated because he was new, good-looking and he had inflated goals because Benitez's strategy was superior to all the outdated premier league teams (much like how Mourinho was so successful when he brought the 433 in 2004).

So now he has expectations through the roof, but he's actually only a good squad player, maybe 20th best striker in the world. This was cemented by a 50 million price tag so everyone wants a goal per game.

Then his first (half) season at Chelsea was terrible. He had a hard time adapting to Chelsea, and his pace was not as good as it once was. Now the disparity between his expectations and performances sets a new narrative: Torres is a massive flop.

The next season he adapts his game, improves, but is still obviously inferior to Drogba, progress but disappointing.

Then the next season (our Europa League winning season) Torres actually has a decent season. Scores the most in Europe, manages to be a squad player for almost 70 games because until we got Ba he couldn't get any rest. And what happened? NO ONE NOTICED.

This is why I get so defensive: people think everything below his Liverpool goal tally is failure, but that was the anomaly. Instead, by his 3rd season he was integrated into the team well enough to be: adequate. But by this time the narrative was set: he sucks, no questions asked. Every missed dribble or missed chance got 10x the attention and every assist was interpreted as him ""not having the confidence to shoot""

This season Torres was adequate. He wasn't anything special, but he was no worse than Eto'o, Ba, Giroud, Negredo or Soldado. But the dye has set and people refuse to see a player that makes real contributions to the team and has left his first 2 seasons at Chelsea behind him. Torres will never be as good as we imagined he was.

So if you've got people who earn £87308 working 52 * 5 days, then it's very likely that many of them will be charging more and needing to register for VAT.  Even if they work just 46 weeks a year, I'd imagine there is quite high variance in the rates.

I'm all in favour of legalising prostitution, providing clear rules to prevent exploitation, making them VAT'able and enforcing health checks.  But most importantly providing an efficient system for allowing reporting of violence to the police.

I would suggest offering a flat rate scheme letting them keep ~6%.  Condoms are rated at only 5% so I figure that should be realistic and fair.

In some ways, but between 1945 and 1970 unemployment never went above 3%, since the aim of governments was to maintain full employment (i.e. below 3% unemployment). It's telling that the last time unemployment was below 3% was in 1974, since neoliberal reforms it has averaged about 6% never returning to below 3% again. 

Since the 1970s wages have risen little in real terms despite massive increases in productivity. In the 1990s boom, pay growth lagged behind productivity by almost 30%. Looking purely at direct pay, ""overall productivity rose four times as fast as the average real hourly wage -- and twenty times as fast in manufacturing""^[1]. Since 2008 wages have been falling across the board with the cost of living outstripping earning for pretty much every month since early 2008.

Youth unemployment is at an immovably but record high. University debt is a life-long reality for half of all teenagers. The average first time buyer is now 35. You can expect to be working into your 70s in a job that requires you to work more and involves more monotony and toil. Not to mention an ecosystem that's about to implode, in 40 years at current trend southern Europe will be a desert (a process of desertification that's already in motion with large southern cities unable to meet their water demands, a recent problem), then you'll have hundreds of millions of people heading north to find not only work but life.

Of course it's not all bad, but with what technology we have and the ability we have we are certainly failing behind; it's not scarcity that's the problem but *artificial* scarcity, the point is the attack the system that makes it so.

&gt;and even our poor are not really poor.

food banks is a sign of *real* poverty, it's people not having enough money to feed themselves. Of course there's no such thing as 'real poverty' all poverty is social poverty, all needs are social needs.

 [**Availability heuristic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability%20heuristic): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __availability heuristic__ is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to mind. The availability [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision_making) operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important. Subsequently, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.   Further, the availability of consequences associated with an action is positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater we perceive these consequences to be. Finally, people not only consider what they recall in making a judgment but also use the ease or difficulty with which that content comes to mind as an additional source of information. Most notably, they only rely on the content of their recall if its implications are not called into question by the difficulty that they experience in bringing the relevant material to mind.

Out of all Motorsport events, rallying is the most dangerous for spectators. And tbh most rally spectators know that a car could come off and hit them. 

Placing huge screens everywhere isnt the answer, having screens at the start / paddock / service area is a bonus though. 

Also due to rally stage areas and size it is near on impossible to secure the area, a lot of rallys are on public roads, hence why the police were involved, they have to treat it as a crime scene. 

Also having all the fans in one place would not work, due to the size of and locations of the stages.

I myself as an avid spectator understand the dangers and must be aware.

I think that the organisers just need to educate the spectators abit more. Perhaps a safety leaflet with every ticket or the such. Explaining the dangers and the fact that you as a spectator accept the fact it is dangerous and accidents involving spectators does happen.

Some groups, perhaps - there are some sectarian gangs in Al Qaeda, who harvest opium. The majority however do not, like I said, Al Qaeda is far from one organisation.

&gt; But you go to great lengths to mention US crimes and ""The War on Terror"". Fun fact: Lisburn. 1988. Conical I.E.D (making the explosion more violent and destructive, an ""artist"" bomb) in a van. Six soldiers murdered after running in a marathon. Not armed. Not on the field of battle.

I go to great lengths to mention US crimes, because I was talking about Al Qaeda, who are synonymous with *'evil sharia law terrorist moosslims'*. Yes, I agree some attacks were terrible during the troubles - but that is how war is fought. A member of my own family was shot (30 odd times) and killed by the RUC, and he was unarmed and on his way home. Both sides in a war always commit atrocities.

&gt; It just seems a lefty one sided argument that doesn't take in the nuances of history.

I am an unashamed lefty, I'll give you that - but I do understand the nuances of history. Like I said, no side in a war has a squeaky clean rap sheet.

&gt; I don't believe your stock definition of Sinn Fein either. First person of an ethnic minority killed in the Troubles was killed by the PIRA in an incendiary bomb attack on public transport. Obviously a legit target.

I understand its sarcasm, but no I don't agree that public transport is a legit target in any circumstances - for a multitude of reasons. Of course, the first person of ethnic minority to be killed in the troubles was not killed out of racism, more the wrong place at the wrong time, during a sectarian attack. Sinn Féin have never been party to an outward attack on any minority, any immigrant etc.

These loyalist and indeed right-to-the-top of unionism, racist slurs and attacks have set out to be offensive toward a specific minority. Inadvertently I guess in the political sphere - but almost positively purposely on ground level, like in the case of that poor immigrant who had shit thrown at him. 

&gt; Doesn't mean I'll ever forget that as a child I had to check under the family car for a bomb before school because my family were legitimate targets to these people and their supporters.

I genuinely really like Lallana and think he would be a great addition just not at the £25m - £30m pricetag.  If we were talking £15m-£18m i would be quite happy with picking him up.

But when you cross the £25m - £30m line it seems like the level of player you are in for is a different level.

Look at the players who are carrying rumours of £30m pricetags this summer....Shaw, Costa, Fabregas, Benatia, Mangala, Carvalho, Pastore, Lukaku, Benzema, Di Maria.  Thats not even taking into consideration the likes of Suarez, Aguero, Cavani, Hazard or the staggering £48m for David Luiz.

Now despite the varying positions all of these players have either more potential upside (Shaw,Lukaku, Carvalho, Mangala) or are established as amongst the best in the world at their given position (Costa, Fabregas, Benatia, Benzema, Di Maria) really only Pastore (and truthfully the rumour for Paulinho as well) sticks out as a player who is being priced similar to Lallana who seems overpriced (and at this rate there is a chance Pastore may end up getting sold for less than Lallana).

true,Brandmon,cnty-commonwealth,British Commonwealth,"Ironically the one reason why the EU is not held directly and democratically accountable is because of another term you mentioned: *Sovereignty*.

What's sovereignty if not a nation's capability of doing everything within its power within a mandated term? Institutions such as the Council of Ministers (composed of the *elected*  ministers of national governments) and the European Commission (each Commissioner appointed by national governments) actually serve to guarantee national sovereignty with regards to EU affairs. 

On the other hand things such as *Elected Officials*, a more powerful European Parliament and further application of referenda would actually *undermine* the nation state, as decision making at European level is taken away from national governments and given to European institutions elected directly by Europeans and the relationship between the EU as a broad institution and the nation itself not decided by national governments but the nation's own people.

Therefore before we pine for *Sovereignty* and *democratic accountability*, yet scorn the coming of the *dreaded USE*, we need to get the facts straight in order to understand what would enable a United States of Europe in the first place. Maybe then we wouldn't be surprised that consecutive British governments, Labour and Conservative alike, are actually both in favour of the staying in the EU and keeping the EU's current functions intact *precisely* because they don't want a United States of Europe.

true,x2501x,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"OK, but that's just the thing-- you are acting as if the format of Doctor Who is not also unique. What other show has there been with *one* central character who is *always* the focus of the vast majority of attention on the show, while *all* of the other characters come and go, none staying around for more than a few years? Even Sarah Jane had to be spun off *to her own show* for the character to stick around, because that is the way the show works. No matter how popular a character, only The Doctor is constant. The characters who have been on the show over a lot of seasons are only those who occasionally appear (The Master, The Brigadier, River Song).

Again, you have never directly addressed the key point I started with-- you can't say the show is *sexist* simply by a metric applied only to the female characters, you can only prove that the writing for the female characters got worse after RTD left. Unless you also study all the male characters and demonstrate that their writing hasn't *also* gotten worse, then you haven't proven *sexism*, you have only proven that some of the characters on the show are more shallow. It doesn't matter what *is happening on every other show on television*, it doesn't matter if the whole universe of TV is mostly sexist, it doesn't matter *if it would be nice* if SM wrote more female characters with independent story lines, the only way to *prove* the claim that his writing for DW is sexist is to examine *all* of the characters and compare them to each other, not simply pick out the female characters, say their writing is bad, and assert sexism.

But again, I'll also say--unless the next regeneration is to a female Doctor, I think it's just bizarre to argue that more female characters on Doctor Who need to have independent story lines from The Doctor, because *none of the male characters do either*. You say that *I am Legend* is OK because it's just one human and a world full of zombies. Don't you see that Doctor Who is essentially the same thing? It's one being with essentially god-like powers, moving through a universe where relative to him, everyone else *might as well be zombies*. All the men, all the women, all the daleks and all the other races. He essentially lives forever and can go to any place in time and space, while all their lives are like that of an insect in comparison. Yes, the show does not portray him as uncaring or unsympathetic, but really, that is the difference between The Doctor and every other being we ever see on the show. Even the other Time Lords basically have now decided he's their saviour as well.

I mean... just from memory, I might bet that one of the female characters who most often *passes* the Bechdel test would be Rose's mother. She is always talking about going shopping, or all kinds of other *mom* things, but she was a character who even in the midst of the story seemed often to be oblivious and would talk to Rose (or to some friend on the telephone) about all kinds of things other than the fact that some monster or another was attacking London. That said... would *you* hold up Rose's mother as a good ""strong female"" character? Because I wouldn't. I think she would pass that test, but I also think she was a pretty *bad* example, kind of dumb and a very weak, frightened person most of the time. So I'd also say that test itself isn't the best metric to be using in the first place.",0,1401634839,null,0,false,0,chwe89x,t3_26rz0u,t1_chwe89x,t1_chw54nz,null,1434045926,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Im not sure that anybody REALLY thought that sherwood was going to stick around through his entire contract. and yeah we had hopes for AVB, but what he provided the team was a philosophy that goes way against the tottenham way, hence the sacking. The great light that poch gives us is, apparently, the beautiful football that we've missed since modric &amp; van der vaart will hopefully return, under Poch's guidance.

Maybe he does have a 'duty' to call out false prophets. But that isn't all he did in his speech:

&gt;Today we see powerful evidence that more and more of Muslims are putting the quorums [sic: he means Q’uran] hatred of Christians and Jews alike into practice.

Enoch Powell was a prophet and he told us that blood would flow in the streets and it has happened.

&gt;Fifteen years ago Britain was concerned of IRA cells. Right throughout the nation they done a deal with the IRA because they were frightened of being bombed.

&gt;Today a new evil has arisen — there are cells of Muslims right throughout Britain — can I hear an amen?

&gt;[At this point the congregation return a weak-sounding amen]

&gt;Right throughout Britain and this nation is going to enter into a great tribulation and a great trial. 

This isn't calling out false prophets at all. It's painting a picture of a people who have installed themselves in every level of society, and who are an imminent threat, just waiting to attack. He suggests that we are going to have to fight this threat (the 'tribulation').

Banks are different, the sum of all the deposits owed to depositors isn't the same amount as what they hold in reserve.

People say we will have CL money, but it's irrelevant in this as for FY 13/14 it doesn't factor.  What we do know is the club lost roughly £80M combined between 11/12 and 12/13.  That said, the club can remove some costs from those losses for things like youth development, although how much that actually is is hard to say as the FY accounts don't break out into that level of detail.

Correct, you are not. Considering the way you've misrepresented things thus far I'm actually impressed that you noticed this. Well done. You are in fact arguing with someone who recognises that the terms alpha and beta are relatively simple words for explaining status hierarchies in terms of human sexual success. Or were you attempting to make an argumentum ad hominem? 

&gt; When you get older and go to university, take a course on evolutionary biology and see if your professor agrees with your ridiculous pseudo-scientific theories.

Again, you are letting your assumptions run ahead of you. Back when I used to lecture whilst researching my PhD it wasn't politically correct to talk about these issues and it could easily end up costing you your job, so of course I did not.

I suggest [you work on your grammar](http://www.wikihow.com/Use-You%27re-and-Your).

You mean in the same way that feminism can't be observed or argued for outside of your echo chamber? I'm afraid you're not correct.

true,java8888,null,null,"How dare you dare that the housing problem doesn't solely rest with the rate of house building but also  with the increasing trend of people buying up the cheaper housings and letting out...

We can build houses until we're blue in the face but if everything which a first time buyer could conceivably buy is bought up by people looking to let it out, then we'll never solve the problem.

There were over 1 million conveyancing transactions over the last year and yet the Government pat their own backs with Help to Buy which has helped around 7,500.

I say help, but real Government help would come in the form of managing the prices so you don't end up needing a Help to Buy scheme so you can raise the £25,000 - £30,000 deposit in the first place.

The previous Governments managed to spectacularly screw things up by overseeing a decade where 1 million people needed first houses but only 20,000 houses were built a year. However, in lieu of solving the problem we've come to rely on it.

We look at our houses as some sort of investment, which is ridiculous since it doesn't create or progress anything (like a business), it just pushes house prices higher having a negative social impact (""Generation Rent"").

If we want to solve the problem, yes we need more houses, but also controls to prevent banks from offering easy loans to those who want to buy to let - no more 110% loans using your current house as collateral. It's causing a very dangerous bubble and it gives those who already have a house an unfair advantage.

I don't like the idea but it's either that or we wait for the bubble to burst causing a massive crash and widespread negative equity. 

Or, as the consecutive Governments seem to think; we could wait it out so the tough decisions can be made when they're not in power.

What Tottenham did was that they lost their best player in Bale and at the same time they did not have a skeleton where they could just put in the new players. Instead the new players made the new bone structure, when they should actually just be some extra muscles you put in. They had no structure overall and Bale was the magic. 

Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling will stay next season and create our magic. 
While Moreno will take the LB spot and do decent (Enrique will help him out), a new centre back to improve the defence. Emre Can will be a rotation player to be used when needed. Lallana has already been playing with the Liverpool players (With the England squad), Lambert as well. The biggest question mark will be Shaqiri if he is coming. 

Tottenham sold their 2 best strikers/goal scorers in Bale and Dempsey, while Adebayor was not liked by AVB. So all their strikers where basically gone before the season.

true,GetsDrunkSendsTexts,null,null,"Some tips to help you save some money as well as pass as soon as you can. Here's how I managed to pass within 6 months. Not all would agree with the below, but it worked for me:

*Don't buy a Highway Code. Buying it would be a waste of money, reading it would be a waste of time. Learn the theory test on the many free apps with trial and error. Repeat the practice tests until you're getting 0 or just 1 or 2 wrong every time. If you want to read the Highway Code (most of it is common sense but some useful stuff about signs and junctions, visit the site, it's free.)

*Do your theory test as soon as you can. Believe it or not, I did mine as soon as I got my provisional and before I'd had a single lesson. Practice as above with the apps. It's the cheapest and most efficient way.

*Do at least two hours per week of lessons. My maximum was four. People who drip lessons every few weeks seem to make minimal progress.

*Get the most of your instructor. I was paying £20/hour and had to change my first because she was shit. We once literally ran out of fuel 10 minutes into a lesson. Don't settle.

*Be proactive when booking tests. I booked mine before my instructor said I was ready. You can alter the date once you've booked.

*if you fail, book again straight away. There is a waiting list of around 6 weeks, but cancellations and new slots happen all the time. I checked every 2 hours and got this down to 2 weeks.

*Get provisional insurance and spend one or two days practicing with parent/friend. Just drive around the area of the test centre, getting used to the area. Provisional insurance for one day is about £22.

Admittedly I was quite obsessive about getting my licence and it was my number 1 priority, if you do the above you should pass within 6 months. Good luck!

Culture contains misogynistic elements because some people are misogynists - and they contribute to culture.  They post online and make subreddits and so on.  Culture is a reflection of us, not the other way round.

As far as I know, there's no misogyny epidemic being caused by the internet. The number of rapes has been steadily going *down*, not up and there's never been a safer time and place for women than modern Western societies.

Possibly; I only got the gun on Friday, I have been trying it out over the weekend. In the future I will consider how seriously and frequently I want to shoot.

&gt;If I was the father of children I would have issues with the discharge of firearms on neighbouring property, too. Especially by teenagers

I understand this completely. My house does not have any access point to his, and my range runs completely parallel to his driveway. Essentially, there is literally no danger of his boys running in front of me, and my range ends in a fence and someone else's property. May I add, this 'someone else' has younger children and is completely OK with me shooting. In terms of me being a teenager, I may be young but I'm not an idiot. I am an Army Cadet and I have had weapon safety drilled into my head, especially since I have handled weapons much more dangerous than an air shooter. My range ends in a pile of old plant matter, so pellets are more absorbed than deflected. Any pellet that hits the fence almost always crumples up and drops off. Any deflections are rarely higher than fence height.

1. He presented no instances, so I have no *reason* to believe my shooting is endangering anyone or thing on his property. Pellets are made of soft lead that crumple and lose most of their momentum upon impact, so don't deflect very high or far: they present little danger once they have hit something (in this case it is always a target or the fence behind). I have rearranged my range so that there are now tall hedges either side of me, to catch stray pellets. 

2. The main noise is the pellets hitting the tin cans. I have summer holidays soon, I can afford to wait til he is at work. He is the only person to have complained, and he didn't specifically mention noise, I only assumed he was annoyed by it.

3. This last point you made did annoy me. Let me clarify, my dad bought the air rifle; *he* owns it. I use it *when* he says I can.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I would hope that the groundwork is laid, and i would hope that part of the conversations with Poch prior to he signed on was on who he envisioned as potential targets  so that the club could evaluate the feasibility of some of the transfers.

Part of the meeting i would also believe to be both Poch bringing some targets he wants (but didn't go into during the interview/discussions) to the table as well as targets that Baldini or Broomfield have identified to get input from all regarding the potential targets.

However i think that the press is going to be taking some guesses as to potential targets at this point. Whether we had deep discussions with Poch or not there are so many variables out there that can affect the information that the writers are getting and that information can swing greatly and at this point while the groundwork may be in the process of being laid (or in some cases finalized) the amount of information both good and bad flowing around leads to a great deal of speculation being put forth by the press. As some of the groundwork becomes more concrete then the press begin to be able to get confirmation that is more reliable from multiple sources we should begin to be able to see more accuracy on some of this speculation (while keeping in mind these things can change very quickly over any number of reasons). 

As for this specific article (i can't say that the author Stammers record is something that i am deeply familiar with as the Mirror isn't a paper that i usually read on a daily basis), i wouldn't be surprised if Caulker is a target, there has been enough talk around him for several months to make an assumption that we have at least considered the possibility.",0,1401642204,null,0,false,0,chwgw8k,t3_2715jx,t1_chwgw8k,t1_chwfz72,null,1434047249,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I know it's more than your budget but I'll still put this on here just incase anyone is interested.

Not sure how many people are familiar with the Hot UK Deals website but it's a great place for current UK offers on a wide variety of stuff from electronics to holidays and works on a similar voting system to reddit i.e. the hotter the temperature a deal has - the better it is.

Anyways I got some [RayBan Clubmasters from this offer](http://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/ray-ban-massive-savings-such-new-wayfarer-from-49-87-delivered-amazon-com-1892645) a few week ago for about 45% less than RRP in England (£60 compared to ~£110).

Basically the offer takes advantage of amazon.com (american site) now offering international shipping. The link above will explain it in more detail but as brands are cheeper in the USA along with combining this with a newsletter sign-up 20% discount code you can make a decent saving on RayBans sold by RayBan on Amazon.

I'm not sure if the offer still works (I know it says expired on HUKD but some still work after this) but it's certainly worth checking out both the website for other offers and also this current deal as I got relatively expensive sun glasses but some RayBans are cheaper still.

You just listed a statistic about the number of Poles entering, but not how many left. That's only half of the required information.

There are a host of reasons why it's not the foregone conclusion that you think it is. Whether the economy grows, the demographic of the immigrants and their skill level, whether they are here to work, how many also leave thus the net migration, and the key one - many migrants came to do SAWS stuff that the existing labor force *would not do * anyway.

The problem is *precisely * these '3 dogs vs 4 dogs' grossly simplistic analogies. The economy is not fixed, and with the exception of a few years, growing.

Lots of talk about his attitude and sure it's still there but he has definitely grown up since his time at Manchester City. He's a brilliant player too, its harder to score goals in Serie A, and he's in a massively underperforming team that doesn't quite fit his style either, but he's still done well, especially last season. I'm sure he'd bag tons of goals for us. Plus he might form a bond with Lamela seeing as they both speak Italian.

However there are a few problems. 1). Wages could be high, especially seeing as he is young and talented and a proven goal scorer. 2). When leaving for Milan he talked about how he didn't like England, especially the press. 3). Poch would want him to work harder... could be difficult with a man like Mario.

I could see this happening, but it seems a long shot. I'm sure a lot of clubs would be interested but I don't know if the top ones would want to gamble on him. If we gambled and it payed off we would finally have a top, top striker

This really pissed the girls off, and they ended up moving out just before Christmas. It all just depends on your luck with the people you get. But I personally never had an issue with anyone, and I don't think that anyone had any issues with me.

Bathroom space was never tight, we had 2 dedicated toilets, and 2 shower rooms including toilets, so it was never an issue.

I didn't move in with them for second year, but all the lads moved into the same house. I'm glad I didn't... I don't really like mess (hence me never going in the lounge). But we all still get on really well, and I don't think they take me choosing not to live with them personally. 

I personally had a nice big room with a double bed, which was amazing for me. I would much prefer to live there again rather than go into the small hall rooms. This did cost me more than some of my housemates who had smaller rooms (still bigger than halls mind), and only single beds, but I think it was worth it.

Unilet houses aren't always in the nice parts. Mine was in Boscombe, which wasn't actually that bad. Yes my bike did get stolen from inside my house, but that was more a case of someone getting drunk and leaving the front door open.

If I remember correctly there are 3 or 4 unilets in Boscombe. It's not THAT bad, but I still wouldn't want to walk around by myself after dark.

I don't think it's crazy for a girl to do five in a day - most penetrative sex probably lasts 5-10 minutes, with the average booking probably 30-45 minutes. Lots of strenuous acts would probably be too much, but if the girl can handle her arousal and lubrication, sex (almost said with the man on the street, but it's not quite that! Let's say the average man) shouldn't be particularly taxing. All assuming she's there by choice!

Parlour girls tend to see more action in a single night, but it's probably only reliable on a Friday/Saturday (though then the parlour will have 5-6 girls instead of the usual 2-3). Most parlours seem to be legit these days: the police investigate them every so often, but 9 times out of 10 they check the girls' paperwork and condition and decide they're okay. In any town over 100,000 people you can bet there's an open massage parlour, and in any top 20 city you'll find half a dozen of them that have been open for years.

That's not to say there isn't a trafficking problem, just that the majority of working girls in open parlours, and the popular independents, are most likely there by choice. Most parlour girls have come in from Poland/Czech Rep/Slovakia/Romania/Hungary and pretend to be Spanish or Italian, but these are all EU countries now, and they haven't come from absolute poverty or anything. Most will work for 3-6 months, save some money, then go back home, possibly to their families.

The most popular independent ladies are British, and as they become well-known they tend to exploit the fact that no matter how much you charge, someone will buy - sometimes *because* you charge so much.

I know this. We should take this as a warning and stop it getting worse. 

&gt; Apart from anything else its nowhere near as bad for you as alcohol or tobacco and its not physically addictive so its pretty retarded that it was banned in the first place. And since banning it doesnt stop people using it, banning it is basically a massive waste of money.

Still bad for you, hence it should be banned. Like I've said the alcohol argument is so stupid. ""This dangerous illegal substance is less dangerous than this dangerous legal substance... It should be legal too.""

It is mentally addictive. 

Banning it does stop people from using it. The problem is at the moment it's not banned. In Britain weed has essentially been decriminalised. It's real easy to get, if Police catch you with it they give you a cannabis warning, no criminal record. That's not a deterrent. Since the Misuse of Drugs Act from 1971, which brought about these incredibly liberal legal changes, cannabis use in this country has sky rocketed. You cannot deny that. Like you said all your friends at university are taking it.

&gt; Whats it to you if people buy weed from an actual shop rather than from some guy they know? because thats the only real difference that legalisation would make.

You're right. That is the only difference legalisation will make. It is merely a matter of convenience. If we make it more convenient we risk having more and more people take this drug. Weed is dangerous; it's addictive, can cause psychosis, schizophrenia, and depending on your chosen method of consumption - smoking - can cause cancers of various kinds. Just because a bunch of idiot stoners want to be able to buy weed more easily is not a good reason to legalise weed.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt; Ironically the one reason why the EU is not held directly and democratically accountable is because of another term you mentioned: Sovereignty.

The EU = Centralization of power. This is not the answer to more democracy, as Farage even said aptly, quote-unquote:- 

&gt;*""The solution to more democracy... is MORE democracy (not Centralization)!""*

&gt;*Maybe then we wouldn't be surprised that consecutive British governments, Labour and Conservative alike, are actually both in favour of the staying in the EU and keeping the EU's current functions intact precisely because they don't want a United States of Europe.*

And so we come to the role of the Pro-EU governments and their practice of deception on the people in so many ways over such a long period of time.

They began their deceptions on the people even before the UK joined the EEC with the European Communities Act 1972: Yes even before they had begun the work of deception on the people.

This is illustrated in:

1. Post-Legislative referendum with question of Staying IN or OUT as if losing something.
2. This included ""Common Market"" instead of ""Ever Closer (Political) Union""
3. This did not include not holding another referendum on further Treaties ever so that what the EEC was then to the EU (and soon to be USE) is so radically different.
4. In 1971 there is documented evidence that they knew an ""Unparalleled"" loss of Sovereignty would occur by joining the EUropean Community; that Community Law &gt; Common Law, etc.

In Poland they don't want the EU controlling their abortions due to their religion. In Germany it's the EU not controlling their bond-market to pay the debts of other nations. In the UK it's Open Borders when our heritage as an island nation with:

1. Sovereignty of Parliament
2. Common Law
3. Commonwealth history and connections to a global world

All frame a requirement for difference in these countries.

The Norwegians did not choose to join the EU and growth in rejecting the EU has increased since 1994. It does not reflect their cultural and national reality. They want to trade with Europe but not give up these things.

Bear in mind if you think the UK Government does not want to join the USE, they did want to join the EURO even though the Labour government concocted every possible means to deceive into being able to: Except they had been forced into offering a referendum (The Referendum Party) and hence dared not knowing they would lose.

**TL;DR**: So much deception and lies and track-record of such eventually the people will grow in awareness of this (and they have only just begun) and they will rebel against the EU project I believe. And here's one part of why: Given the deception would you choose ""ever closer union"" or would choose to reject that not knowing where it will end, and choose democratic power to elect and de-select your own government.

Bear in mind since The Lisbon Treaty has a **self-amending legislative process** within that the UK is losing Sovereignty DAILY; so LibLab's offer of a referendum only under a New Treaty is also deceptive, just as Cameron's ""reform"" in the EU is deceptive and against all the indications and evidence that anything meaningful will be achieved apart from a Wilsonian Fudge again.",0,1401648025,null,0,false,0,chwj8zp,t3_270lkb,t1_chwj8zp,t1_chwdojs,null,1434048359,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,anonmonkey,null,null,"I was in a unilet last year and had a pretty good experience. Generally the houses are pretty standard student houses; not luxury but the university makes sure they aren't squalor (unless you get the one on methuen road which my friend had, which was amazing). My mum said the unilet I was in was way nicer than the student house my sister stayed in at southampton, and my unilet wasn't especially nice, so I guess that's good. There were 5 bedrooms which didn't really vary in size apart from one (it obviously wasn't supposed to be a room, the landlord was just cheeky), although in my house only 2/5 rooms had double bed, so that's hit or miss really (although there tends not to be arguments about this because you will be assigned a room when you move in (although it's not thaaat bad, some uni halls only have single beds as default)). The uni does inspections every couple of months or so to make sure the standards don't drop excessively and they handled all the bills &amp; internet for you. Any maintenance issues are handled by the uni too (we never met the landlord, it's all done via the uni); they give you an online form and emergency contact number - we had an issue with our dishwasher (not sure if they're standard) and the uni organised a company to come take a look within a couple of days without hassle, so they were very good.

Most of the unilets are in Charminster I believe, which is pretty studenty; cheap, lots of student houses, fast food places, etc. Not the nicest place in the world but perfectly alright; it certainly grew on me once I got used to it. Bit of a pain going on a lot of nights out as you can't just walk places like you can in halls, but you get used it and there's always buses/taxis. 

The only thing we really encountered was fridge sizes varied dramatically between the unilets; we had a small fridge (~5ft high inc. freezer bit) between 5 of us, although most others seemed to have much better fridge:people situations (I've heard rumours that the uni does have some fridges in storage, so if you have a small one whinge to accommodation right when you move in and you might be lucky and get another).

Overall I liked my unilet; it was a good house and as everything is basically done for you it makes the transition to uni very easy. I paid £94p/w for my place in Charminster inc. bills (everyone in the house pays the same), so it was pretty good value in my opinion. The only downside in my opinion is if you don't get on with your housemates as in halls you can just makes friends on another floor, whereas you can't really do that in unilets. That said, a lot of the unilets are close together so I'd recommend meeting with the people around you, just to meet new people (they make you do an hour mandatory safety/public relations thing at the start of term, so all the unilet people will be in one place which is a pretty good time to meet people (I think they might also have a facebook group or something)).

true,tbiz12,null,null,"I don't want to sell Agger either, but there are issues with some of your points. 

First is that past performance is irrelevant; his current form is not good and has been poor for a lot of the season. Rodgers sees him in practice daily and is judge, jury, and executioner. If he doesn't like what he sees, then it doesn't matter what Agger did in 2010.

Second is this idea that because Skrtel had a turnaround, Agger will too. It is *possible* that Agger has a similar revitalization. It is not probable. He has been playing under Rodgers for the same amount of time as Skrtel - as first choice for a good chunk of time, mind - and has not proven that he works in this system. How many years does he get before we finally accept that it's not working? 

Third is that because our entire defense is shaky, Agger gets a pass for mediocrity. Yes, sitting back and defending would help. But so would better players, and the fact is a lot of teams play an attacking style and do not concede as many goals as us. The idea that organization, coordination, and consistency are solely down to coaching and not talent is foolish - those things are all talents in their own right. Carragher brought coordination and organization; Agger doesn't. Neither do Skrtel or Sakho, because none of them are wired that way. Obviously coaching can improve, but don't professionals have to take at least some responsibility for their individual errors?

I like Agger, but people here defend him to the death solely because of his dedication to the team. Johnson is not far removed from a great season, but everyone wants him shipped. Skrtel did not have very many supporters at the beginning of the year despite being player of the season not too long ago. Reina had years of fantastic performances for Liverpool, but people were happy to see him go. It's only Agger that gets this special treatment. Loyalty is great and I respect what Agger has done, but we have to be in the business of winning games now. 

Does anyone think that we bought Sakho for 18 mil to have him sit on the bench? It's Agger's spot that he will take, and Agger is not a backup. He's a starter, and a world class one in the right system.

 - They get their choice of teachers, so while those in non-grammar schools might need better teachers, they don't get them
 - Academic ability isn't universal across all subjects, just because I was talented in the Maths classroom, didn't mean I was any good in English. This means that you are still going to be in the same classroom as someone struggling.
 - While academic studying is of course the most important part of school, you should learn to socialise and understand people from all walks of life, this includes those with a lower IQ than would get you into a grammar school (and IQ is basically what the 11+ measures from what I can remember)
 - Did borderline kids fail to get in because they had a bad day? Did they succeed because they guessed the last question? If not, tough, your fate has been decided for life
 - 11+ practice papers which only richer parents can afford
 - Generally only middle class parents consider it.
 - The last two especially mean it doesn't effectively create increased social mobility

* The riots three years ago - Immigrants are to blame etc

I appreciate that most people don't espouse the most nuanced view of this, and that longer term trends tend to be overlooked in favour of shorter ones, but **those with the views listed above have a point**. 

If you have X number of council houses in a given constituency and the demand for those houses increases while supply remains constant, this will only increase the strain on the public service. Same goes for health services and much else besides. Of course in the long term working migrants are likely to boost the economy, facilitating the funding of more services, but that isn't much use if you've nowhere to live now.

&gt; What I think they seem to either forget - or completely overlook - is that the vast majority of immigrants don't come here to sponge off the 'generous' benefits and live a life of luxury. They come here to find work that pays more than the pittance they might earn doing the same job back home. The proportion of those born abroad on working-age benefits is actually lower than that of those born in the UK.

I'm afraid I cannot source this for you, but there is evidence to suggest that as a given diaspora increases the dependency ratio becomes less favourable. While the first wave of, say, Romanians will be forced to work or leave, subsequent waves can lean on their countrymen for help, and as migrants become settled they tend to bring dependants (spouses, children, elderly parents) that aren't so profitable from our perspective. This is one of the arguments for tightening the rules.

&gt; Another fear some people have is that their own British cultures might be supplanted by the cultures and religions of immigrants, but again, there don't seem to be many instances of this.

I don't see how it's deniable that if you have a large population of Poles moving to an English town, that town will become less English culturally. If you travel around London you will certainly find communities in which a migrant diaspora has supplanted the, for want of a cleaner word, indigenous population. 

I happen to think there is a property aspect to this which has been overlooked. Who, after all, owns a given town, or even a given quarter in a large city? Often the politicians who oversaw migration waves never consulted the people whose communities it was likely to affect (see Brixton, Streatham, Tooting), and the white working class that remain feel they have been turfed out of their inheritance. Gentrification poses a similar problem in this regard, but at least the middle classes share more culture with the working classes they are pushing out. 

Paul Collier also wrote a book called [Exodus](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exodus-Immigration-Multiculturalism-21st-Century-ebook/dp/B00ELXQYM0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401651909&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=exodus+paul+collier) which discusses the damage to trust that migration can engender, especially in cases where two communities live parallel lives, in which de facto segregation takes place. This seems to be an inevitable function of letting diasporas grow. 

&gt; I think these are just two examples of how the press are twisting the truth with the aim of legitimizing their anti-immigration stance. Britain is one of the most tolerant countries in the world, but before long this won't be the case, and that's really quite sad, to me at least.

The press is merely responding to the fact that people mostly want to have their impression of the world confirmed. It would be nice if everybody was a diligent student of politics and wanted to challenge their own views with well researched policy documents, but humans unfortunately haven't been built that way.

I'd argue that a lot of it has to do with where a lot of Muslims emigrated to as well. The worst problems are in ex-mill towns where Pakistanis and Bangladeshis were recruited to ailing mills to work the night shift; the economic and social collapse of the 1970s and 80s has a lot of responsibility, I think, for the very difficult problems with integration that have occurred there.

true,cragglerock93,null,null,"&gt;If you have X number of council houses in a given constituency and the demand for those houses increases while supply remains constant, this will only increase the strain on the public service. Same goes for health services and much else besides. Of course in the long term working migrants are likely to boost the economy, facilitating the funding of more services, but that isn't much use if you've nowhere to live now.

I can't deny that it makes sense that an increase in the number of service users with no simultaneous increase in service provision will put more stress on that service, but it's up to the government to increase provision to meet demand. The OECD claims that Immigration has a net financial benefit to the UK economy, and since 50% of the economy will find its way to the Treasury, this should provide the means to provide these additional services. Admittedly this is no comfort to those waiting for a council house, but the housing shortage goes way beyond immigration.

&gt;I don't see how it's deniable that if you have a large population of Poles moving to an English town, that town will become less English culturally. If you travel around London you will certainly find communities in which a migrant diaspora has supplanted the, for want of a cleaner word, indigenous population.

I guess it's all in moderation. I wouldn't condone a huge community of immigrants to settle in one town/area of a city (although this is the natural thing for them to do). They need try their best to assimilate with the existing community, and not isolate themselves, which will only serve to increase tensions. I don't know what you mean by the working class feeling as if they have been turfed out. It's not as if a landlord can have them removed on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality, and if they own the property, then they certainly can't be pushed out.

LOL. Yes it does.  Landlords aren't allowed to claim housing benefit directly off tenants.  It goes to the tenant and then the landlord.  Only if they go into arrears can the landlord claim some of the housing benefit directly.

This is perhaps the billionth time

&gt;look at Spurs

has been used as a case against spending big money. And it's wrong every time. They bought the wrong players. Played the wrong system. Had the wrong manager. Forced a high back line on tugboat defenders. Had a striker playing up top alone who was incapable of doing so. I could easily say ""Look at Chelsea in 2004"" or ""Look at Madrid every season"" or ""Look at City three seasons ago"" or ""Munich three seasons ago"" as evidence to show that spending money and overhauling the squad does work. There's plenty of examples when a team sells their best player but is still just as good. It's all about buying the right players. Having the right manager. And as long as the spine, as long as Gerrard, Henderson, Sturridge etc are playing, then we shouldn't worry about bringing in several into the first 11. Rodgers can figure it out. Point being is that it's not at all accurate to use Spurs as an negative example as to what happens when you sell your best player and overhaul. There's a million reasons why Spurs were shit. Who btw were ONLY three points worse off than last season. Gareth Bale equalled three points. In fact in the first half of the season they were one point better off. You're so wrong, mate. Honestly, your name is beautiful, but come on. You're just perpetuating this myth. People need to realise ""LOOK AT SPURS"" proves fuck all.

Key to maintaining competitive advantage is investment in R&amp;D. The UK has a strong base for this because it has some of the best universities in the world for engineering. What it needs to capitalise on this is investment. The Government should make very cheap loans available to the likes of RR and GKN conditional on it being invested in R&amp;D (shareholders don't always like R&amp;D, so don't give them a choice). 

Thankfully, the destructive, toxic gambling (aka ""banking"") sector is no longer seen as an asset to the economy but a toxic liability. It has spent much of the last two decades usurping talent and money that could have strengthened engineering sectors.

When we had our inspections I'm pretty sure they emailed us a couple of weeks in advanced; they let you know and I think they even send you the blank checklist they use so you know what they're expecting. We didn't have a tumblr dryer and I'm not sure I remember any other houses having one either, but we did have a reasonably sized garden and we strung a washing line from the house to the tree at the end. We also had the living room which to be honest no one really went in because we spent nearly all the time in the kitchen, so there were clothes horses and and ironing board in there too. Space wasn't an issue in our unilet (apart from the single person who got the tiny room).

We all paid the same in our house no matter what room we got, as far as I know that's standard because it's set out by the university when you sign the contract. I'm pretty sure my friends all paid the same as their roommates too...

I didn't go on to live with any of my housemates from the unilet, I think that 3/4 of them dropped out and I don't really know what happened to the other one (she never came out of her room), so I ended up living with people from my course.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"FYI your stats don't show unemployed people but people who are ""not in work"". There's a difference between a housewife not seeking work (because her husband works for example) and a woman on the dole who can't find work.

Since 2008 there's been a huge surge in the percentage of Bangladeshi and Pakistani immigrant women entering the workforce. Employment is rising for them faster than any other group. When it comes to their daughters born in the UK, Bangladeshi girls do better than any other group (if you adjust for income) and they're also surging in the labour force.

&gt;According to the Labour Force Survey, though, the number trying to find work is increasing surprisingly fast. Since 2008, when Britain entered a deep recession, the proportion of Pakistani women active in the labour market has increased from 29% to 43%. For Bangladeshi women, the trend dates back further (see chart). Many have merely moved from complete inactivity to unemployment, but there have been sizeable jumps in the proportion who have jobs too. By contrast, the employment rate for white women, at around 68%, has barely changed. Among black African and Caribbean women it has fallen.

and:

&gt;And the young generation is rising fast. “There has been a near total transformation of Bangladeshi girls” since 2001, argues Shamit Saggar of the University of Sussex. In the GCSE exams taken at the age of 16, Bangladeshi girls now outperform their white peers. Control for poverty, and they beat almost everyone. Pakistani girls have done less well—probably because they are less concentrated in London, where schools have improved most—but they have gained ground too. More of these well-educated second- and third-generation young women enter the labour force each year.

This is why you meet so many people online who are only interested in going on and on about the demon immigrants, and don't seem to be interested in thinking this through, and don't seem to have any interests or thoughts apart from 'immigration and immigrants are bad'. Each one of those millions of comments sees itself as a lone voice crying in the wilderness, hence their weird, empty determination and self-righteousness.

This is *also* why it's difficult to have nuanced discussions, because you might get jumped on or dismissed for being a stupid racist by people on the other side of this issue ... who assume that you're just another agent of the conspiracy against immigrants.  

(I can also guarantee that lots of people stopped reading this post a paragraph ago because of the short attention spans we're all developing in the digital age. The same short attention spans that lead people to adopt simplistic positions on immigration.)

Lots of the people who say they don't like immigration come from a social world of limited money, council housing, few or no jobs or opportunities. 

Meanwhile lots of the people who say they like immigration come from the opposite, wealth and comfort; a *lot* of the immigration 'debate' is really just people identifying themselves socially by stating the correct opinions for their social world. 

The people with shitty lives who get angry about immigration frequently have several mates or colleagues who are immigrants, who they actually quite like, but somehow don't 'do the maths' on this and live in a kind of cognitive dissonance. They also confuse the categories 'foreign national', 'immigrant', 'illegal immigrant', 'asylum-seeker'. 

Meanwhile, it's easy to look down on the anti-immigrant tantrums of UKIP voters and tabloid readers without actually knowing any immigrants yourself, and without having to ask what you really think about various cultures and religions that are different to what you're used to. 'Decaf tolerance' without any of the hard work.  

So, most of the 'debate about immigration' in Britain is really a sort of cold class-war imho. The actual facts are out there, but no-one is very interested in them, and really important discussions are waiting to happen but again it seems we'd rather take the easy option. Meanwhile, a lot of decent and harmless human beings who just happen to be immigrants are used as dog-track hares by the press and by politicians.

My problem is I agree with him on the detail where he says the pastor ought to be free to say what he did. Freedom of speech which does not include freedom to offend is not worthy of the name. 

There are good reasons for freedom of speech. Principal among them is a concern for the pursuit of truth. At many points in history where new ideas now accepted as true were advanced some were offended by them. Galileo was condemned to death unless he recanted, iirc. Socrates was condemned to death for asking too many awkward questions. Yet together with Plato and Aristotle he laid the basic framework for our entire western intellectual culture. There are many other examples. Offence is the norm, not the exception. Perhaps Mohammed caused offence.  

Can we be certain Muslims aren't satanic? I can imagine Christians, Jews or Hindus being satanic, just about, though I find it highly unlikely, since I don't believe in Satan. So why not Muslims? I can't be 100% certain they aren't. Can you?

It's important that the freedom to say things no matter how offensive or manifestly false should be protected. 

I am unhappy to be in agreement with Peter Robinson on this one detail because I strongly dislike him, but I think the principle is important. 

In fact I find the idea I should not be free to cause offence highly offensive. This alone renders it absurd. I would resist such constraints with more than speech. People will impose such constraints on me only over my grave. I was born free. That is how I intend to die.

You're completely right that the difference might be more than £5m, but £25m plus say £5m wages for Lallana versus £30m plus £10m wages for Fabregas is still an absolute no-brainer imo, especially given Lallana is only a year younger. Lallana would be a good addition to the squad, but he's not instantly putting world-class talent into our starting XI in the same way Fabregas would. I think £25m is very expensive for Lallana. I think £30m for Fabregas would be superb value, no matter how much he's asking in wages.

So I bought a RA4 Rotaprint printing press. I got into it just as the black and white photographic print took off, previously it was plain text or a drawn illustration.

Firing an air weapon within 15m / 50ft of a public highway £1,000 fine. 

Not sure how far you are from the road, but you said you're near his driveway, so this might be an issue.

2) It is an offence to discharge a firearm within fifty feet of the centre of a highway, if doing so would cause a nuisance or endangering the public

Again, I don't know how far from the road you are, but if he's annoyed, then the ""nuisance"" bit might apply, in the eyes of the law.

3) When shooting over private land it is an offence for the pellet to go beyond the boundary of the premises on which the gun is being used unless there is permission from the adjoining landowner.

If you did get a ricochet into his garden, or even a miss shot, technically you'd be breaking the law. Whether the he'd take action is something you'd have to work out from knowledge of his and your relationship.

I'd have a chat with your Dad, and then maybe have a chat with the neighbour, saying that you'd like to continue shooting, but would like to do so in a way that does not upset him. 

Perhaps build a decent backstop, with some sandbags or similar (I used to use fertiliser sacks stuffed with old clothes) to avoid overshoot, and invest in some proper paper targets on a wood backing to minimise noise and ricochets, and maybe ask him what time's would be less likely to annoy him.

I suspect that the police, if involved, might be more likely to side with him than you if you come across as a irresponsible teenager shooting cans in the garden. However, if you can show you are taking all reasonable steps to minimise the risk then you'd stand a much better chance of him looking like a petty complainer, rather than a concerned member of the public.

&gt;he fact no mainstream political party is running on a policy to legalise weed shows that there is no desire amongst the majority of voters in this country to legalise weed.

I didnt realise political parties actually listened to their voters all of a sudden now. Also more of the old right wingers who want to ban everything are dying off every year, the drug laws will be reformed eventually its just a waiting game.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"As far as the movie goes McGann was not the weak link as they say. I thought the script was less than stellar and I just loathed Eric Roberts as The Master. Even for a character that's usually way over the top he was totally hamming it up and I do not mean that in a fun way. But McGann from the moment he got on screen, even with the crappy wig, lol, he was a marvelous Doctor. He took a TV movie that was IMHO at best mediocre and made it totally worth watching. 

I caught up with the audios very late. I was never all that much interested until I found out that McGann did a series of them. That peaked my curiosity and I went and got a few. I've got most of them now and though I still have a few to go I don't regret going there at all. Listening to his stories it really made me want to see him back on screen so when he did the mini it was just like ""OH, YEAH BABY!"" (Delighted grin....) I think most of us had that reaction, didn't we? 

I really think the PTB were surprised though at just how popular his little surprise mini episode was. I hope they are getting it, that we DO want to see more of 8. At the least I'd love to see a few more minis and a big guest in an episode or two like with 10. I don't expect it right away.

""I didn't need to change. I didn't want to."" 

The resolution to this admittedly shocking cliffhanger was so anticlimactic and nonsensical that it just pissed off a large number of fans, myself included. Vanity is a trait that is so against the sum of the Doctor's character, it shouldn't even need to be explained why the fact that a Doctor who 1) regenerated into himself and 2) was brooding and spiteful and angry about his impending regeneration shows weakness in a character that should be able to cope with this process. 

Just look at how the ninth doctor embraced his regeneration and left with a laugh, or how the eleventh doctor left with grace after musing about the importance of change but still remembering who you are. Change is good, change is beneficial, and nothing is gained by standing still. The way the tenth doctor's last story was written treated change as death, which as previously said flies in the face of everything the doctors stand for. 

In Logopolis, like the tenth doctor, the fourth doctor knew throughout the story that he would end up regenerating (though this information was provided more subtlety), through the presence of the Watcher. In the end he sacrifices himself, but is ready for the change: ""It's the end... but the moment has been prepared for."" This is what the doctor is about. I'll leave you with quotes from the 6th and 11th doctors, respectively, that further exemplify my point.

""Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon""

true,TheForeignMan,null,null,"I think some things need to be cleared up on the topic of immigration.  
A lot of the time I see that people claim that migrants lower the wages of the native population. Not true: studies find that wage effects are insignificant (Dustmann, Fabbri and Preston 2005), (Bruecker et al, 2002).  
White immigrants (i.e. Europeans) have a higher wage than natives (Algan et al, 2010) so all this crap about limiting EU migration will make us *worse* off.  

Every 10% of migrants increase the wage at the country of origin by 3% (Mishra, P. 2007). This means that migration from poor countries will slow down after time (we've already seen this from Indian &amp; Polish immigrants). Romanian &amp; Bulgarian immigration will make their respective countries richer, which makes the EU (and therefore the UK) richer as a result.  

Immigration surplus in 2012 was £1.9bn, and the effect of the reduction of tier 1 &amp; 2 migration (brought about by the Conservative government) is estimated to cost us £2.8bn over the next 5 years (Metcalf 2011). 

So tonnes of economic evidence points to immigration as a good thing. This is not taking into account the moral argument: it is unfair to deny movement to people just because they were born elsewhere.  

One last word: anecdotally I've noticed that people against immigration are also for the 'free market' (e.g. the Conservative party), forgetting that for free markets to work you need free movement of capital *and* labour. Otherwise it gives an unfair advantage to owners of capital (and it shows).",0,1401663667,null,0,false,0,chwpgal,t3_271rs7,t1_chwpgal,t3_271rs7,null,1434051348,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,gamesqueen,null,null,"Social positives may have been exclusive to my situation but I found that because I lived in a unilet I knew people in unilets, so I very rarely felt it to be much of a problem and I met lots of great people I wouldn't have met otherwise. You have different problems in a house to when you're in halls but I think it makes you more independent and more prepared for second year onwards. Some of the unilets are really close to others and you'll probably really quickly make friends, others are really out of the way (as one of my friends was) and it can be difficult to feel part of it particularly during freshers. 


My advice to all freshers is to try and get on with your housemates and always be nice no matter what, but don't expect you'll be best friends. Some people drop out. Some people really change. Some people are great. You are 7 (in my case) people being thrown into a house with the only thing in common being that you go to the same uni. Most people I knew got their place through clearing rather than choosing it through applications so for a lot of people they have never visited the uni. Two of my housemates from first year I still live with, two I still speak to and the other two I have basically not spoken to since we stopped loving together. But I know people who had big fall outs in first year and list good friends because of stupid housemate rows.

You will have fun if you're not in halls but it can be hard, particularly if you're not a person with hobbies. And if you're not big into the club/dancing/drinking thing it can be even harder so bare that in mind (not to encourage you if you're not into it , but just be aware that the drinking culture is big at uni and is often how close. friendships are formed).

If i were to go back a chose i wish i had been in student village. It has quite a nice balance of being in a house but still being in a nice community. However they are (largely) shitholes, and I think I'm basing my decision on the fact that a lot of my now friends lived there and had fun. Each year a different halls is the 'good' halls and one is the 'bad' halls, I'd say don't sweet the decision too badly. Although I think purbeck might be due a refurbishment after next year so you would have to live in squalor but you would definitely get all your deposit back.

Now I'm not saying who is right or wrong - I see where both camps are coming from, but I do believe if I was club captain I'd expect to have my calls answered and that maybe board could have managed this situation better.

Relevant part:
&gt;The club may be able to write off a loan made by their owners Fenway Sports Group to repay a £38m loan taken out to develop stadium plans by the former proprietors Tom Hicks and George Gillett. 

That is 38 million written off due to the club paying out on a long term investment, ie stadium plans.

Moreover, Liverpool will be earning 42.5 more million from the improved TV deal and our standing this past year. Source: http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27411682

The latter will count for the FY 13-14 figures.

As you can see between the new TV deal, commercial deal bumps, and the writing off of long term investment expenditure, we will be more than fine. This is also not taking into account that our wage expenditure has been reduced from FY 12-13, and 11-12. Also keep in mind that from the figures you posted, the ""Loss on disposal of player registrations"" will also go down quite a bit in FY 13-14. We will more than make up ground on the 80 million we lost over the past two fiscal years that FFP will no doubt look at; in addition to UEFA taking into account the long term health of the club and incoming CL revenue from 14-15.",0,1401671370,null,0,1401671683,0,chwshs9,t3_27162u,t1_chwshs9,t1_chwpvz5,null,1434052789,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Istanbul will always be bittersweet for me, unfortunately for 2 reasons. One of them is funny looking back on it now.

I had 1 more end of year final the following day and then I had three months off for summer. I told all my friends that I wouldn't actually be watching the match and that I would record it and watch it the following day. I didn't think that would be a problem because I live in America and none of my friends at the time gave a toss about football.

So i went home and revised and I was actually proud of myself for being able to concentrate on my studies more than the match. I was in a groove and for most of the time I had completely forgotten about the match completely.

Then my phone rang, it was my best friend. I assumed he had a question  about the exam the following day so I answered:

The stupid twat: ""Greg OMG ARE YOU WATCHING THIS LIVERPOOL JUST EQUA-""

Me: SHUT THE FUCK UP I TOLD YOU IM WATCHING IT TOMORROW

Him: ....Fuck....so you did. K sorry bye *click*

I was gutted. I looked at the time and worked out it must be about 60-62 minutes into the match, accounting for first half stoppage time. I thought, okay well at least we scored. I knew we had levelled the match. I obviously thought it was just 1-1 or something. I went back to my desk and tried to bury my head back in my books.

I couldn't. 5 minutes past. *Okay, about 25 minutes to go* Another 2 minutes past. *Fuck, this is killing me*. Another 30 seconds past. Time had officially stood still. *Shit, what should I do? I'm fucked if I don't study but I'm not being productive anyway.*

I battled with my own brain for about another 5 minutes before I thought fuck it and I went upstairs. I turned the TV on, went back to the beginning and started watching. Boom, 1-0. *Well, at least we scored in the 2nd half*.

2-0 *Damn. I wonder if I would've turned off by now if I didn't already know we will equalise?""

3-0 *Fucks sakes, we scored 3?!? GOd damn it I would've liked that to have been a surprise.""

50 minutes: *Okay, wow. We surely couldn't have scored 3 in the next 10 minutes. I must've got it wrong. Maybe we just pulled one back.*

54 minutes:*Yes, get in Stevie!* 6 minutes left before I'm at the point where Daniel called. I wonder....

56 minutes: Huh...we must've done it.

60 minutes: I didn't get up, I didn't really celebrate, nothing more than a fistpump anyway. I had known it was coming all along. As pleased as I was we were back in it, I was crushed because I'd been denied the excitement.

61 minutes: *Okay, at least I don't know anything that happened after that. We're back in it and I can enjoy it now.*

From then on I was a bag of nerves but in the back of my mind I was still absolutely gutted that the surprise of those 3 goals had been taken away from me.

When the final whistle went, I just got down on my knees and cried. I was so happy. I kinda had a feeling we'd won for a while though. My dad had gone to the pub to watch it and when he came back, he came into the room to watch the end of it again. I thought to myself ""Surely he wouldn't be watching this again if we lost""

Afterwards I watched the whole thing again. And again. Eventually I went back to my books and did another 15 minutes of cramming before going to bed. I got an A on the exam anyway (my only one out of all of them haha).

For days after I was buzzing. I rewatched the match about 20 times. We went to Brazil a few days later and whilst there I found out my dad had been fucking his secretary (yes, we found this out on holiday halfway around the world). I then had to tell my mum....worst moment of my life (bar deaths in the family). It was 9 years ago tomorrow (well, June 2nd depending on where you are in the world). I can't watched highlights of that match without thinking about it. Cue a three year long divorce because they fought over EVERYTHING and 5-6 years of not wanting anything to do with my dad. It's obviously not all directly related to the match but because there were only like 7 days in between the two events, I can't help but associate one with the other now, which is a shame.",0,1401671752,null,0,false,0,chwsnfu,t3_2729rz,t1_chwsnfu,t3_2729rz,null,1434052883,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

I am working on 32,000 and after tax etc I get about 1950 per month. So you will be better off than new graduates, and a fair chunk of working people. A 2 bed house in glagow, scotland, costs me 695+150 council tax + 150 bills. So that would leave you nearly 1000 quid to live on, which is lots. I guess brighton would be more expensive (I used to live in cambridge near london and was paying about the same for just a room, whereas a room in glasgow is about half that at best), birmingham is probably similar, as the north and midlands is cheaper than the south.
&gt; 

I'm from Brazil, so I do have a car here, but I´m not sure if I'm going to have one there. I think it depends where I'm going to live there. I'm also considering Glasgow, since it has a great university. Is 2000 enough for 2 in Glasgow?

I can't see clearly - wiping the visor is a challenge at 70mph and heck - chances are it'll just smudge or be the same again in 3 minutes so why bother. There's no chance to rest on a 2 hour ride. I get off the bike buzzing and wanting more :P I don't think 5 minutes is long enough to get excited about wet riding - more hassle to get changed and get wet and then dry out - but try long distance so you get used to it :P it really is important to work out that your gear really is waterproof for an extended period sooner rather than later - are your gloves good for an hour in heavy rain, are your boots good enough, is there water dripping down the back of your neck, when is it worth wiping your visor and when is it not (wow - it's really clear now, why didn't i do that before v grr, damit- now it's just all smeared and smudged). Get some casual experience so that when the first time comes that you really are miles away from home and have to ride etc, you're sorted. Go out in the rain when you don't have to - test your gear! I right with a friend who has the same bike and much more money than I do and he's been riding years on scooters and now a bike for 4 years - he still hasn't got a set of decent wet weather gear. His gloves get soggy, his feet get wet, he doesn't have pin lock, he doesn't have a full waterproof jacket - it's embarrassing. I just don't realise how much he's suffering when it gets wet. The twat. But he only really does 20 mins to/from work in town, so a 200mile day out with me shows his gear sucks.  Go ride rain - carefully! :P ",0,1401674518,null,0,false,0,chwtuzx,t3_26mvih,t1_chwtuzx,t3_26mvih,null,1434053424,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

This happened in 2010 when I started and they put out the same message in 2011. I never bothered looking after that.

I know Loughborough is a good uni and a popular one, but it comes down to how popular your course is over anything else, and how much the admissions tutor likes your application.

In short though, just try your absolute best in your next two exams. If you're capable of a B you can push for an A. And getting more UMS overall means  more chance of negotiation with Loughborough should you get BBB and not ABB. They're more likely to let you in if you're 1 UMS off an A compared to 20 UMS off.

&gt; Who, after all, owns a given town, or even a given quarter in a large city? Often the politicians who oversaw migration waves never consulted the people whose communities it was likely to affect (see Brixton, Streatham, Tooting), and the white working class that remain feel they have been turfed out of their inheritance. 

There's a dangerous idea crawling under there , that politicians deliberately planned for areas of London to become ghetto-ised. Statements like this annoy me, because they buy into a consipiracy that there was some devious plan to let in all the West Indians to ""undermine"" ""English culture. 

In fact, if anyone bothered paying attention to the actual history , as opposed to the mythical one being spouted by UKIP, they would realise that politicians were actively campaigning against immigration with openly racist platforms - [Peter Griffiths being a classic example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Griffiths)

People stayed in areas like Brixton because it was safer and less racist. Very few places offered you a home - remember ""No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish""?


&gt;The press is merely responding to the fact that people mostly want to have their impression of the world confirmed. 

This also absolves the press of the responsibility it has in creating and engendering a climate of fear. The Press as much an influencer as it is a listener, this was proved by the way PMs and prospective PMs sidled up to press barons such as Rothermere. If you look at Labour's response to the asylum seeker hysteria of the late 1990s int he Mail and other papers in setting places like Yarls' Wood and restricting asylum seekers' rights it's pretty obvious there is a ling between the commotion generated and the response.

So, as the NHS website says, to get this service free at the point of use you need to demonstrate you intend to stay here long term (and as I was told about on /r/europe earlier, EU countries do deport other EU nationals if they're a burden on the state). You need to show them you have long term rentals in place, for example. But that is straightforward.

Also, I feel like it's important to add: even for EU citizens, the government has recently tightened up accessibility to benefits so you shouldn't expect to arrive and to get benefits for living here in addition to treatment. In terms of living costs you'll need to support yourself in the short term at least.

But to be honest, I wouldn't come to the UK for this. France has some of the best cancer treatment in Europe. If I got cancer I'd probably be looking towards moving there rather than relying on the NHS if I needed cancer treatment if the NHS wasn't helping me. The UK's cancer treatment is good, but it isn't the best in Europe. See some examples:

http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/news-report/study-highlights-varying-cancer-survival-rates-across-europe
http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/12December/Pages/UK-cancer-survival-rates-below-European-average.aspx

Certainly by no means am I suggesting to not come to the UK for treatment. But what I am saying is that there is the potential for better treatment in other EU countries that you are entitled to just as much as you are in any other EU country, and this is something worth looking into.

Another issue is waiting times. You'd need to register with a GP (and getting a GP appointment in some areas can take weeks) who then needs to refer you to a hospital and that can take some time (I think the target is to see you within 60 days of a GP referring you). I've no idea how quick or easy it is in other countries in the EU, but I think it's worth pointing out that it isn't possible to simply show up and say ""hey I've got cancer, sort me out"".
