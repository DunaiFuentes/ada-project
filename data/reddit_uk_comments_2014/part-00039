The problem with female comedians is that their topic base is just to pander to women, male comedians do include sections where they talk about the other sex. But most of their routine its across a broad range of topics, whenever a female comedian comes up its the same old.

 ""why do men... why do women... why do men... why do women... this that*

Gold rose to popularity because people no longer trusted their assets like shares and bonds to be worth anything (also institutional investors knew gold would spike in economically uncertain times ) 

Now that the worst of the problems are over people are wanting interest/dividend bearing assets. They will slowly ditch gold in favour of assets that give a dividend ( interest rates are low so bonds aren't worth it that's why there is a share price spike - It's the flood of money being parked to gain interest/dividends ) 

The only hope for gold is that once the US federal reserve slows down it's money printing the third/second world economies that are predicted to crash do so.  This will cause a brief up turn in the price of gold ( I doubt it will last for long or be so pronounced ) . Otherwise gold will settle close to it's intrinsic value as a production and ornamental metal. Rather than a store of wealth.

I think it was 2006 when I first watched a Chelsea match (also being the first non-International match) and really, it was because of my friend that I watched it. I was an International student who just flew across the ocean to study in Canada. Coming from a completely different country, I knew absolutely nobody and had nothing in common with anybody until my roommate dragged me into watching football. I'll have to admit that it took a while for me to find any interest to the team, since I really had nothing other then the color blue to cheer for. Though, watching Chelsea matches with my roommate and playing football with all my dorm people was my way of spending times.



I'm not too sure since when I started calling myself a Chelsea fan, but I know I've never departed with the club. I switched my school and had to depart with my friends I played football with. The new school I went to was full of rugby fanatics, so I had no chance of playing football and had no reason to follow Chelsea anymore. However, I couldn't find myself just dropping the club. All news and matches still mattered to me. I think this is how it would to feel attachments to the club. Chelsea stomped Liverpool? Hell yeah my day is a great day. Chelsea lost to Barca due to bad refereing? FUCK YOU BARCA AND OVERBO YOU FULL OF DISGRACE. Knowing how it felt during those times, I don't think I'll ever leave Chelsea even if Chelsea were to get relegated.



Since then, I've been supporting Chelsea, but I've also started following Gangwon FC, which is a team playing near my home town back in South Korea. We ended up getting relegated to the 2nd division last season. Though, that will never be the reason for me to stop supporting the club (to be real, there is no such reason).

But play against a team that has literally EVERYONE pressing, and arteta is your only ""DM"" (of sorts)? No chance, they desperately needed Flamini in that game.

I really can't pick a MOTM because it was pressing from all our non-defenders that allowed us to do so well, and our defenders all played extremely well.

Cissokho had a ""good"" game, but I still feel like Enrique plays at that level or better every game, but its certainly comforting to know that he can play like that.

Unfortunate for Gerrard to have that little brain fart and make a silly challenge, would have been really nice for the defense and migs to pick up a well earned CS, but that shouldn't take away from what he did for the rest of the game.

On your point of Sterling-like players, as I mentioned Timo Werner is a player in a similar spot in his career, as is Johannes Geis.

On Suso, I was fairly confident that the plan for him to be pulling the strings in a slightly deeper midfield role had been apparent in the academy. True he did play a no.10 role for the u21's for a long time, but in the long term i.e. when he matures slightly (or slows down) I believe they will try and turn him into Alonso's role.

Cissokho is not good enough for us and whilst I don't mind him as a back up to Enrique during this loan period, I would be disappointed if we didn't find better in the summer.

His main plus point is that he is solid defensively. When he's in the right position, he's hard to get past. This is fine, but we need more. His positional sense is not good and he gets caught up the field so often when he should be back. When we're not playing well this leaves us exposed. On top of that, he's not a threat going forward. This is not essential for a PL quality fullback, but 90% at least offer some width and can get a cross in. Aly rarely does. There are times he has beaten a man or set up a 30yd Suarez header, but these are exceptions.

I'm from Sheffield originally and absolutely love it down here, the city is wonderful but like anywhere you go there's the bad parts and good parts. I've lived around Clifton/Redland in the 3 years I've been living off campus and I've only been mugged once!

I'm obviously a bit biased but my opinion of Manchester isn't particularly high. It wasn't one of my considerations when applying for courses so I'm not really in a position to comment on the institution, the city itself isn't fantastic based on the last couple of visits.

The sports teams down here have a strong rivalry so Varsity month is a good time to be around and worth factoring in if you're thinking of joining a team, I play on the Squash team and don't think we've ever been beaten by Bristol Uni the entire time I've been here ;).

I do have an old friend from my school days who's on the CS course at Bristol proper and he highly rates the department, I think he's actually the president of the CS Society atm (or he was last year). 

I also dated a girl who read Physics at Bristol Uni for a while so I spent a year hanging around Wills Hall a lot, loads of posh people but they're not all bad. It was fun to tag along to all the various balls and functions they had, reminded me a lot of my visits to Oxford University. 

I've got a bit of a soft spot for them because even though they get a lot of stick from the other halls for being stuck up not one of them ever made a comment on the fact that I wasn't at the 'real' university.

Why would they, carbon monoxide is cause by the incomplete burning of fuel, not as a result of flooding?

Many shows have to stop down for set changes, different lighting set-ups, and most common--equipment failure.

I'm sure when Stephen does his science experiment, they *do* stop down to make sure everything is ready, and things like the ASIMO or ""ID the thief"" will take more time to prep and shoot.

One of the shows that I currently work on is 30 minutes, and we block out ~2 hours for taping--but it's a lot more complicated and we have several set/lighting changes that we have to deal with.

Overall, I'd say that they edit out the inane chatter, things that fell flat, and any technical issues. They'll do pick-ups when they have to, but they'll do them in the moment instead of doing them afterwards. As long as the re-do's don't take too long, the show can keep its momentum.

When on the wing almost a full 180 degrees of range is taken away from his first touch thus making him a lot more predictable to defend against. But through the middle he shines.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"&gt; making the only legal option to use drugs so sterile it turns people to the black market

It really depends on the drug, I think. Some can be regulated like tobacco and alcohol. While others you might want to handle in a only-for-addicts sort of way.

Seems to me that no one is going to want to go sit in a drug-using room to  smoke some weed, and they're not going to be desperate enough/addicted to have no other choice, either. Plus given it's harmfulness it's fine to regulate (in the opinion of many).

Take something like heroine on the other hand, so addictive and harmful that it might not be a great idea. However a lot of these drugs are pushed onto people *to* get them addicted in the first place so that they can sell more to them, have them under their control, etc. But as soon as you are offering it free to addicts, the benefit of someone bothering to do that in the first place is vastly diminished, and the black market is suddenly not very profitable.

Your first hit is free.... and then... all your other hits are free, too. Not the best marketing model for criminal gangs is it!

&gt; what level of drug usage we want to accept if we want to legalize the industry

So I'd just go with whatever is necessary.

I'm not sure that I personally think there should be any drugs that don't have a regulated offering of some sort, or a *very* workable healthcare plan that actually stops people using them - at least in the case of addictive ones.

Whether it's ethical to give someone something so destructive as crystal meth, though, is an interesting one. But what's the alternative? That they get it anyway but have to degrade themselves, commit crimes, and all manner of other shit at the same time while supporting criminal gangs?

Its good to have the option of playing the 3 engines (Lucas, Allen, Henderson) to control the midfield, as we saw vs Tottenham 5-0.   We have a few formations in our pocket and its up to Rodgers to utilize the correct ones given the match-up.  We've had our hands tied with injuries but as more players come back Rodgers will have more options.  

I'm still convinced that Lucas can be a major contributor to this team over the next few years.  His ability to break up play is literally off the charts in every statistic.  Our win rate with him in the team far exceeds when he isn't.  We LFC fans need to grow accustomed to the idea that we must have options rather than just a set of players we're forced to play due to being skint.  Gerrard doesn't HAVE to start every game.

Haha. Precisely what I was thinking: Where was this team against Villa and West Brom??

After the much-harder-than-it-needed-to-be 5-3 victory over Stoke and then the disappointing 2-2 draw to Villa, there was certainly some reason for concern. But we bounced back in a big way, in a big match with a 4-0 against Everton. Then back to earth with a 1-1 draw against West Brom but then we bounced back again with our 5-1 dominance over Arsenal.

So what does that tell us?

I think those matches against Stoke, Villa and West Brom are - thankfully - outliers and are not reflective of our overall quality this season. They are simply stumbles that other clubs make as well (Norwich-Man City finished 0-0, who would've thought that?).

The important thing is that politicians realise that *every drug is different*, and that the strategies required for each drug will be different. There are totally different harms and usage patterns associated with each drug, and people use different drugs for different reasons. 

For instance, I think the current way that alcohol is sold and consumed on licensed premises or in your own home would be pretty much perfect for cannabis (maybe tighten up the regulations on advertising and branding too). When you use cannabis, you just want to chill out with friends or at home, so it's pretty much like alcohol in that respect.

Something like LSD is probably only going to be consumed at home (or perhaps out on a walk). You're unlikely to want to use LSD at a pub or club. So sell it over-the-counter at pharmacies, complete with detailed information on how to use it safely.

MDMA is a club drug, so licensed venues with strict no-alcohol policies would be appropriate.

The trickiest ones of course are the highly addictive drugs like heroin, coke, meth, crack. I really don't know what the most pragmatic solution to this problem is. On the one hand, an addict is most at risk if they are forced into getting these drugs from criminals, but on the other, it's pretty clear that society should do everything it can to prevent people becoming addicts in the first place.

The policy needs to based on a) acknowledging that some people want to use drugs, and that is completely normal (almost everyone uses alcohol, and humans have used drugs since there were humans) b) that most drug users make a rational choice to use a particular drug (ie. MDMA to have a great club experience, alcohol to chat with friends at a pub, cannabis to relax at home) c) that the crucial thing is to make these activities as safe as possible.",0,1391948096,null,0,false,0,cfauyqv,t3_1xe9xx,t1_cfauyqv,t1_cfaodbz,null,1432320009,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I think demonise is a strong term. My initial reasoning was that presenting an argument that racism is inherent and to abuse scientific language in an attempt to justify it to others is unhelpful. I could just as easily (it may be even easier) use genetics and evolution to argue the counter-argument. Trouble is, there doesn't exist any compelling evidence either way and it is unlikely any will be discovered in the near future over a link between things as complex as racism and genes.

My point is that to claim racism to be natural and inherent is to appear to some to be saying it is normal and acceptable. Therefore, to do so should only be with a cogent, evidence-based argument.

Tbh, I think whether racism is inherent or learned is irrelevant. Regardless we should seek to remove its ill from society and I'm glad we agree on that.",0,1391948932,null,0,false,0,cfav2u3,t3_1x9qxn,t1_cfav2u3,t1_cf9k1fe,null,1435501252,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

All fair points! I passively use Facebook to keep in contact with friends &amp; family but don't ever upload or curate information on my profile. I have the Facebook scripts which log page use blocked so they don't track me across other websites I use.

Google, yes. Yahoo, no. Apple, no. I don't like or trust Google's omniscience over the internet but if you're using a service for free, you are the product. I block Google Analytics and have adblockers. From my perspective, I don't really give a damn what Google have on me.

When Borini comes back, we will have an actually useful impact sub, that will bring something, when the rest of the team is deflated.

Suso will bring some competition for one of the wingers and allow them to rest. He isn't first team just yet, but a season with C1 cup, FA cup, League and, if all goes well, CL then he will gain a lot of experience.

I don't think we're keeping hold of Assiadi, he just wouldn't be THAT useful and would mainly sit on the bench, like Alberto. I think we can get a few million for him (~7/8 million) and use that money to go towards one world class player.

I think Alberto/Aspas will leave, when we get our loanees back. They would be getting even less playing time and they haven't even showed any promising matches. The only reason they're still here is encase anything extreme happens, like Sturridge/Suarez injured, for the rest of the season.

I think we should only spend on 1/2 players, that are already proven. We have enough youth players that will grow into great players, but with CL within our goals we need to bring experienced players in. I'm not too sure what position, but I'd say we need a LB, to compete with Enrique and encase he gets injured again. Aly will leave at the end of the season if we get a LB.

As to 'they need to hunt for food' bollocks! 

International law recognises the rights of people who depend on bush meat or wild meat to hunt for food - that's why people who live in central Africa are allowed to hunt species which European and American tourists aren't allowed to hunt.

for-profit trade in endangered animals. A 3 year old could understand this distinction.

1. Don't use your money to pay for university. Get loans. Investing the money will make far more in gains than the interest on the loans. You'll come out ahead in the end.

2. Don't buy a new car. Loads of young people with a bit of cash make this error. Buy a cheap used car by all means (Mercedes-driving adult me still looks back fondly on the Nissan Micra I bought with my summer job pay at 17), but make sure you can cover the running costs through income.

3. Agree with the chap/chapess who said premium bonds are shite. They are.

4. Figure out how much you are going to save long-term and NOT TOUCH (hint: the correct answer is most of it). Put £11,520 of that in a stocks &amp; shares ISA now, and the rest in the same place after April 1st (so you don't overshoot your tax free limit for the year). Within that ISA, buy some nice low-cost funds (people always recommend Vanguard funds here and in r/personalfinance, although I have a little more appetite for risk, personally). Then sit back and watch compound interest work its magic. If you add to it when you can, you might just find yourself with a nice deposit on a house once you're ready to settle down.

true,Owner_of_GoalDotCom,null,null,"&gt; If we're both in the champions league, both challenging for the title

What makes you think Liverpool will be challenging for the title? Liverpool won't be challenging for the title any-time soon, and do you reckon players would rather play for Brendan Rodgers or Arsene Wenger? Someone who hasn't won anything ever, or someone who consistently turns players into world class superstars and has won 3 Premier Leagues and 4 FA Cups, with a Champions League Final appearance. That's why Ozil chose to come here rather than Manchester United, he'd rather play for the smaller club because they had a better manager. I agree that Liverpool have a better history and stature but I still think Arsenal are more desirable because of our manager, training ground and current players.

If Suarez leaves no world class player will want to go to Liverpool. Why would they? Liverpool have no guarantee of playing Champions League football for a prolonged time whereas Arsenal do. When Tottenham had a one-off Champions League campaign they managed to buy Van der Vaart, Gallas and Pienaar. Those aren't world class players.

&gt;Secondly, you say you're basically a striker and a midfielder off being truly something. Here's some names: chamakh, gervinho, bendtner. All signings that got gooners moist about a proper challenge, all strikers who failed to deliver.

A world class striker of Ozil's stature and a good defensive midfielder like Sven Bender. Both are realistic seeming as we have the funds and Wenger is willing to spend on players worth their price no matter how expensive. He didn't sign Soldado for 28m but signed Ozil for 42m. That just goes to show he is willing to buy players worth their price.

Chamakh was a free transfer brought in to be backup to van Persie and did a decent job filling in his injured boots (7 goals in 10 games in 2010/11) Bendtner was brought in from the youth team. Gervinho isn't even a striker, just goes to show your lack of knowledge. I fail to see your point.

&gt;On that point as well, we have holes in our side as well. We don't have as much depth as our rivals... But we're still only 6 points off first. Unlike arsenal who promises so much and delivers so little, we've got a squad who is playing for each other and playing with belief.

Hahahaha you think this Arsenal side is underperforming???? People at the start of the season thought we'd finish below Spurs and Man United, now we're the only non-sugar daddy team actually challenging the money bags. This is a slow process to build a team around Wilshere, Ramsey, Walcott and Ozil, and we are showing great progress from last year. People thought we'd not make it out of our Champions League group, but we made it through and beat Dortmund at Westfalldenstadion in the process. That is proving your doubters wrong.

true,The_Inertia_Kid,null,null,"Premium bonds: depends on your appetite for risk. Premium bonds are essentially you loaning your money to the government. Anything involving 'sovereign debt' like this will not pay much interest. Premium bonds are even worse - there is no guaranteed interest. Instead, a computer randomly assigns prizes each month. You might win £1 million. You'll probably win a lot less than that. The average premium bond makes 1.3% per year in these prizes. 

So your parents are right - premium bonds are very safe. But the downside of that is they will probably make you 1.3% per year. If you invested £15,000, that's £195 per year. Not even guaranteed. Inflation is currently 2%, meaning the cost of living (prices etc) is going up by that amount each year. Your £15,000 will be worth less in real terms (i.e. it will buy you less stuff) each year unless your investments keep up with inflation. 1.3% is some way short of that at the moment.

Essentially, any investment paying less than inflation is making you poorer, not richer. But it all depends on how much risk you want to take. 

An index tracker fund replicates the performance of an index - for the sake of argument, lets say the FTSE 100. Now the FTSE 100 has a lot more potential for growth than something like a premium bond. The FTSE 100 went up by something like 13% in 2013. If you had put your £15,000 into a FTSE 100 index tracker fund on January 1 2013, you would have had £16,950 on December 31 2013.

Of course, as I said earlier, risk and return are linked. If you had invested your £15,000 in a FTSE 100 index tracker on January 1 2008, you would have had £10,350 on December 31 2008. Markets can go down as well as up. When they go down, they tend to drop sharply - ""up the stairs but down in the lift"" is the old saying.

That said, looking over a longer timeframe (as you should be), markets will rise. Over a ten-year period, it would be bizarre for the FTSE 100 not to average more than a 1.3% average annual increase. Nothing in markets is guaranteed, however.

On your other question, as u/DrPubertyBeard points out below, April 5th is the last day of the tax year. Your ISA allowance (tax free) is £11,520 for the current (2013/14) year. That resets on April 6th, and the allowance is rising to £11,880 for 2014/15. That means you can invest £11,520 up to April 5th 2014, and another £11,880 up to April 5th 2015.",0,1391955032,null,0,1391955904,0,cfaw1mb,t3_1xfhwb,t1_cfaw1mb,t1_cfavknx,null,1432320517,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

Also QI has several female regulars who are hilarious.  I seem to remember at least one episode of nothing but women and Alan/Stephen.  Now is it an even split?  No.  But I honestly think QI puts an effort for a diverse group. 

If you looked at these shows from an American point of view the lack of color is much more drastic. 

I understand this policy but it feels heavy handed.  A directive to try to include more women would have been a better start than a dictate. If that didn't work then set a quota.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"&gt; Dogecoin is inflationary, more like a real life currency.

Not quite, Dogecoin adds coins at a regular rate whether the economy needs them or not, this is likely to decrease the value of dogecoin while the value of Bitcoin will increase (assuming similar adoption, zero adoption obviously gives them zero value)

&gt; Bitcoin encourages hoarding.

Interesting part, I think only time will tell on this one. Hoarding is discouraged by the risk of Bitcoin, and also mass hearding would devalue any decentralised currency as the value is decided by its users, if users are unable to obtain bitcoin, they will be less inclined to use it and so will reach an equilibrium. 

The early adoption phase with Bitcoin is over, it helped get Bitcoin ""out there"", but it isn't a pyramid scheme at all. A pyramid scheme suggests that people who buy in now, pay those early adopters, thus continuing to make them money. This doesn't happen. Your BTC are yours regardless, a small number of people made a lot of money (at high risk), but it's been and gone. It can still happen with dogecoin and others if they take hold.

All cryptocurrencies (read most) including Dogecoin are brilliant, in my opinion, dogecoin's biggest mistake was the name. I can walk into a business and tell them why they should (or shouldn't) trade Bitcoin, Litecoin etc. But going in there with a stupid meme dog and claiming it's a serious tradable currancy will provide just more barriers.

However, your point that Dogecoin solves the initial problem of trading online without giving away personal details is right, Bitcoin and others do the same.

Bitcoins currency cap in the short term will make no difference, in the long long term that, plus the blockchain size could make it harder to use.

Dogecoin's regular topup could likewise be its downfall, as dogecoins are added to the mix over and over again whether needed or not, the value of dogecoin will drop and it will be buying 0.0000000000001 BTC with 100000000000 Dogecoin. I still feel something in the middle would be better, some way to add currency where needed and if possible rescue currency from lost accounts.

Edit: Dogecoin is giving 100 billion dogecoins to a handful of early adopters, then just 5.2 billion dogecoins per year thereafter... if bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, then I could argue that dogecoin is too based on the same logic. However I still don't see either as, both have just chosen a different way to enter the market.",0,1391956499,null,0,1391957589,0,cfawcda,t3_1xf92p,t1_cfawcda,t1_cfavtw6,null,1432320659,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

I agree with you its problematic, and can be improved, notice how i addressed the idea though:

I specifically didn't spell out a detailed plan, the appropriate standards to be met for selection for the election pool, or even assert that it was a good idea, just chipping in my tuppence worth thank you.

No. It almost seems you're trying to project malice onto me by this stage. I casually contributed to someone elses idea. I didn't write a whitepaper and send it to the House Of Commons.

&gt; Surely it would be better to require that the person selected shows they have a good understanding of the area or field, which going to university doesn't guaranty.

You are contributing to the idea with a further prerequisite of experience? Good idea! How do we measure it? By exam? By a popularity contest (nomination by peers). By a nomination of superiors (how open to nepotism that would be). Improve on my selection, by suggesting a selection process that eliminates for haplessness or a general lack of experience.

1. Why do we have debt?
A. Because we need money upfront to pay for things.

2. Why do we run a deficit and not a surplus?
A. Because our finances are not politically sound.

One of these answers is subject to change. The other isn't. There will always be debt, even when we run a surplus (see question 1), so to concern oneself with it is pointless.

Tomorrow in the newspapers: 'Why Climate Change is still Rubbish and a Big Loony Left Conspiracy'.

You know, even though that it's a recognised thing by over 95% of the scientists working in the field. Even though that from 1991 to 2012, only 24 of 13,950 of peer-reviewed climate science articles rejected global warming ([source](http://desmogblog.com/2012/11/15/why-climate-deniers-have-no-credibility-science-one-pie-chart)).

Or that from Nov 2012 to Dec 2013, only 1 author out of 9136, from a total of 2258 peer-reviewed articles, rejected man-made global warming as a thing that exists ([source](http://www.desmogblog.com/2014/01/08/why-climate-deniers-have-no-scientific-credibility-only-1-9136-study-authors-rejects-global-warming), this article also includes a link to a list of all said studies).

And according to the UN, we've only got about 15 years to start curbing carbon before the problem becomes impossible to solve without technologies that don't really exist yet ([source](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/01/16/1270099/-Leaked-UN-Climate-Report-Paints-Bleak-Picture-For-Humanity?detail=facebook)).

What is it going to bloody take for people to start taking this seriously? It absolutely boggles the mind how easily it's just ignored, or dismissed as bunk with reasons ranging from 'it was cold the other day' to 'scientists don't know the real world, bunch of elitists that they are'. Meanwhile the politicians are 'getting rid of the green crap' and promoting fracking like there's no tomorrow... which is, distressingly, looking more and more likely!

Christ on a bike, what is it going to take?!

true,_The_Editor_,,likes quizzes,"1. Chuck a load of chopped up onions, carrots, celery, a few bay leaves, and smoked lardons (optional) into the roasting tin *before* the beef joint. Drop the joint in on top - cook as per usual (you want the veg to cook right down in the meat juices!!)

2. Once cooked, remove the joint from the roasting tin and set aside to rest before carving. Leave all the veg mush in the roasting tin, and transfer to the hob over a low heat.

3. Take a potato masher and really smash up all the veg mush and anything left over in the pan.. Scrape all that caramelised tastiness from the bottom of the pan, scrape, mash, repeat...

4. Gradually work in some flour, and keep the heat on. The longer you keep this mush frying off, the darker your gravy will be. 

5. Once the flour is worked in and you've got a homogenous paste frying away, gradually add hot water and give it a good boil.. Add more flour to thicken if necessary.

6. Once you've reached the desired thickness, ladle it out and push through a sieve. 

It's a bit more work than Bisto+Water, but damn it makes a good gravy! Inspired by Jamie Oliver's [Get Ahead Gravy](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/get-ahead-gravy) recipe I tried this Christmas.

You could try chucking in some beef bones to the roasting mix (get these from the butcher) to give a real deep beefy flavour, if you're lucky you'll get some marrow in there too! Or maybe a spoon of marmite/bovril in when you're frying off the veg mix.. Maybe add a bit of ale (a decent stout/porter perhaps!) instead of water when you're making up the volume of it..

The answer Stephen Fry gives is that people laugh more at men than at women. Alas they do not provide citations so we can't see where this info comes from, but if true, is it bad to be including more women simply because they are women? Surly we should have a system where to appear on a funny show the barrier should be “how funny are you?”, not “how funny are you and do you have the correct number of X chromosomes to meet our quota”.

There will NOT, I repeat, NOT, always be more than our current debt to GDP ratio, because it is unsustainable, as other countries have realised. Get it? Understand that or should I say it slower?

The fact that you know one basic thing about economics is making you sound incredibly moronic. I've spent plenty of time studying debt crises, the fact that you apparently don't think these exist is astonishing. Also, your bizarre separation of high deficits and high debt levels is even more concerning, as even the most basic bit of modern macro would show that the deficit is linked to the debt ratio in terms of long term sustainability.

Sorry mate, you're out of your depth here. Reading one biased blog about how there will always be debt is doing you no favours. I'd suggest some reading on modern macro models of deficits and debt, a textbook exposition of which can be found in Romer's book.

I think you've got the career trajectory kind of backwards here, the panel shows are usually the first TV performances for stand up comedians who are just breaking into TV, after dedicated stand up shows like stand up for the week and comedy roadshow etc. They usually have a couple of big names and a couple of smaller ones, so they shouldn't have to worry about the comedian being 'big enough' for people to know.

Been to four or five Red Sox games.  Traveling support is not really a thing due to the distance between professional teams.  It's just too expensive for most to see their teams frequently live.

It would be absolutely unheard of for someone here to say that you aren't as much of a fan if you don't see them live.

So watching our team across the globe at home or in a bar doesn't really feel any different than watching our local teams in other sports.

Loudness, screaming and cornering someone don't have to happen for it to be a very intensified argument. 

Ade pushing it in front of the team was not a good call, and it completely undermines management when it happens. And for that, I'm not surprised he was sent to rot, although I was not in support of it. 
I agree, you *should* challenge ideas and opinions of your bosses, but you have to be smarter about it. I don't run into my bosses office and challenge everything in front of him. I also don't do it in front of others. I do it in private and show how and why a different course of action may be better. If he/she doesn't agree, I ask why and what doesn't work with my idea. 

Beyond that, letting Ade getting away with critiquing his tactics in front of the group without penalty creates precedent of undermining management. No company or professional club wants that. Because AVB wasn't a skilled man manager, he just exiled him  instead of sitting him a while and letting him know that it won't be tolerated. 

Collaborative team work is fine in your organization, and in my job, and in a thousand in one other jobs.

Started with 1 striker and Eriksen on the left flank and 4-1-4-1 formation  

Lloris 8/10 kept us in the game early on, only one poorly weighted pass to walker which we werent punished for, good decisioning making generally today  
Walker 8/10 works hard , needs to cross more effectively, good vision/opportunistic play to pick out adebayor for the goal  
Dawson 8/10 also good plays/positioning to neutralise everton esp on corners  
Verts 7.5/10 solid play, looks good in tandem with dawson  
Rose 8/10 made good interceptions, provided an outlet for play, forward play positive, crosses ok  
Benteleb 8/10 read the game decently, won the ball back more than he lost it, even found himself in forward positions, has become better since debut  
Eriksen 6/10 was not as effective playing from the flank, subbed in second half, (may have had an injury, not sure) , still need to improve on cornerkicks, much better centrally (obvious statement)  
Townsend 6.5/10 , came on as a sub, returned from injury, lacking match fitness, good to see him back  
Dembele 7.5/10  effortless grace on the ball, still lacking that penetrative final pass/shot  
Paulinho 6/10 looked so out of it today, one touch passing didnt connect as previously, a forgettable display from him today, subbed off in second half  
Capoue 7/10 came on as a sub after spurs took the lead to shore up the defense which he did well  
Lennon 7/10 played on both flanks today, needs to punish the opposition with clinical passes, there were times he was in open space and not found and equally at times not providing an option to teammates, a bit frustrating day for him/us  
Defoe 6.5/10 came on as a sub for lennon with less than 10 mins remaining , soon to toronto, had one opportunity to score, did not, but at least kept everton's defence honest with his his presence  
Adebayor 10/10 great work rate, even found himself deep into spurs half defending, converted a half chance with a well placed shot , amongst 3 defenders,   

Spurs needed this win against a good everton team also fighting for CL spot, as we  have been winless last two games.

The orchestra world provides a very clear demonstration of this, as musicians are supposed to be picked purely on the basis of how their playing sounds, and there has been lots of research comparing blind auditions to standard auditions.  It turns out that people are consistently strongly biased in favour of male musicians, and there are also biases towards more attractive people and people who have an impressive-looking instrument (like a Stradivarius violin).  As a result, I believe blind auditions are now standard, and they even go so far as to ask you to remove your shoes so that nobody can try and guess your gender from the sound of your footsteps.

It's generally thought that the main cause of this subconscious bias is that we are simply more used to top musicians or comedians being men, so a woman doesn't really fit our image of what a good musician or comedian is like, so we are more likely to judge her harshly.  The only way to get rid of it is to get us used to seeing women in these roles.

I just don't understand how anyone can bury their head in the sand and pretend we already live in a meritocratic society, and that any effort to make things more meritocratic is just ""political correctness"" (I really wish that phrase would die - it's almost as bad as ""I'm not racist but"").",0,1391965628,null,0,false,0,cfaz2k8,t3_1xe5my,t1_cfaz2k8,t1_cfao85w,null,1432321946,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I do disagree with most of what you say though. I do think we're making progress but we're bound to have bad patches like this month, especially with injury problems. it's a bit of a cliche but we're still ""in transition"". We're already less reliant on hopeful crosses from the left and Jags diagonals.

 There's lots of things that need improving too though. We need to move the ball quicker, pass better in the final 3rd and our corners have been terrible but these things that can improve with time.

We can't make quick fixes like Spurs can and spunk £30m on a striker and we can't afford to pay the wages of 26 centre-mids either, so we have to go about things in different ways.

I'm just thankful we're not content with top 10 finishes like that berk Neville was.

true,The_Inertia_Kid,null,null,"Alright then, I'll take it on. ISA stands for Individual Savings Account. They were introduced by the Labour government in 1999 to encourage the general population to save more. They replaced the slightly-more-complex PEP and TESSA schemes.

On its most basic level, an ISA is a savings account that is free from income tax and capital gains tax. Any gains made in an ISA are free from tax. They are provided by a whole range of institutions, from household name banks to online-only providers.

ISAs are not limited to cash only. Savers can hold a wide range of other assets within an ISA, and keep them sheltered from tax. This includes individual shares, funds and investment trusts.

There is a limit to how much can be added to an ISA each year. The limit for this tax year (April 6 2013 - April 5 2014) is £11,520. This is increasing to £11,880 in the next tax year. Any additions beyond this limit are liable to capital gains tax and income tax.

A maximum of 50% of that allowance (£5,760) can be held in cash, whereas up to 100% of the allowance can be shares/funds. If money is withdrawn from an ISA, it still counts against the allowance. If you deposit £10,000 then withdraw £5,000 later in the same tax year, you are still counted as having used £10,000 of your allowance.

Your bank will almost certainly provide a stocks &amp; shares ISA. I know mine does. Unfortunately, this is almost certainly not the most economical way to invest in one - banks tend to charge (comparatively) quite high fees for them.

There are a huge number of ISA providers online. I personally use Bestinvest Select (http://select.bestinvest.co.uk), although I am aware that it isn't the cheapest option around. It is far cheaper than if I had used my high street bank, however.

For average savers like you or I, individual shares are not a sensible way to invest in your ISA. It concentrates risk far too much. The vast majority of S&amp;S ISA savers invest in funds - they invest in a range of assets on behalf of their investors. For example, the star of my ISA in recent years has been the Cazenove UK Smaller Companies Fund. It invests in FTSE 250 and smaller companies. It's closed now, unfortunately, but there are several other funds that have similar strategies.

For someone just starting out, something simple like an index tracker fund is probably a sensible choice. An index tracker fund aims to replicate the performance of a particular index (FTSE 100, S&amp;P 500, etc.), meaning your investment will rise or fall by the same amount as that index.

A big key for small-timers like ourselves is costs. The ISA provider will charge a fee. The fund manager will charge a fee also. The smaller your investment, the more those fees can hurt. That's why many around here and /r/personalfinance like Vanguard tracker funds - they tend to have low fees.

Female comedians are seen as bland because they often are, they have *very* similar routines for the most part, which is why many people don't like them. Jo Brand, Sarah Millican, Sandi Khorsandi etc all talk about very similar problems, namely their problems with men, eating food and feeling guilty about it and issues affecting women.

""Yes""

This is more acceptable than the fucked-up questions asked by immigration officials. If someone is willing to lie about their sexuality then they would answer those questions anyway, but untruthfully, and still would feel humiliated and abused.

As a bisexual man I couldn't tell you why I like breasts or why I like dicks, I just do. In all likelihood the officers in question were probably straight, so how could they tell if the responses were genuine?

That's another thing - what about bisexual people? If someone had to flee their country for being in a relationship with a man, but once in the UK had a relationship with a woman would he lose his right to stay here? 

The entire thing is a shambles.

To be honest I believe that immigration controls should be completely removed. Deciding an arbitrary number of immigrants for each country is a racist practice, particularly when most of the countries with the largest restrictions were fucked up by western imperialist countries in the first place.

EDIT: not to mention the fact that this line of questioning reduces a person to the sum of who they have had sex with.

What Scotland provides is five centres (not resorts) with some of the best natural features and terrain you are ever likely to come across on your doorstep.

We cannot account for the weather, but that is unique to the UK and her position on this planet. More often than not it is the wind that can turn a bluebird day into a mass exodus off the hill.

But if you educate yourself, read the MWIS reports, learn the area (we don't do pistes) and accept that a two or three hour drive means you can park next to a mountain then Scottish Snowsports are an addiction you will not be able to shake.

If you want a week of guaranteed shredding down maintained pistes or pretend offpiste then head abroad and enjoy your time. I lovey ski-kends in Switzerland, but I promise you that the best times of my life on plank have been getting spat out of terrain down Glencoe, Nevis and Cairngorm. I do miss the old Nevis summit park mind you.

The boardcross they built at Cairngorm 4 years ago after the Olympics is now an annual feature. And awesome.

Let's not forget our dry facilities too. The dry slopes and parks, including Hillend where Emma Carrick-Anderson cut her teeth - just had a massive investment last year.

It's all there. You just have to chill out and go with the flow. Happy Days :)

* What is the total life expectancy of a Time Lord, given 11 regenerations, 12 incarnations, and barring outside forces?

* Now that the Doctor has been gifted with a new set of regenerations, will his net aging process continue as if he started with 22 regenerations, or is it more like getting a second life cycle, with a rapid beginning, slow middle, and a rapid end?

Their reasoning is that panel shows have a disproportionate number of male comedians to female comedians (which is fair).  This is a self-perpetuating problem; fewer female comedians on panel shows = people think female comedians aren't that funny = bookers don't want to book female comedians on panel shows = and repeat.  There are *loads* of funny female comedians, and this policy will shift the exposure spotlight that panel shows give more in their favour, which they need.

In reality, less female comedians have attained the stature to appear on such show, whether it be because of sexism or because there are just not as many female comedians overall.  Either way, there's less options, which means less women will be available.

Localbitcoin sellers don't convert your GBP to Euro (and back again), so they are saving that international transfer fee and the exchange rate fee.

On a similar note, IBWT holds GBP as GBP, though if you use our banking funding system then you're still liable to pay the international transfer fee. If you use the mailing system then there is no international fee, nor exchange rate fee.

And .. Apple blocks blockchain .. shrug, use IBWT with your Apple phone, you can pay/receive, do exactly the same things. What Blockchain is now developing, we already did. What Btc-china are now doing (deposit via hard currency), also started that a while ago.

No. But it's not good PR, and in an awareness campaign, where his involvement is to generate GOOD PR it's not ideal.

It causes a controversy where there was no need for one. Indeed hunting at all may well be a bad image for someone who is campaigning, ostensibly, for certain animals NOT to be shot. At it's worse it sort of sounds to some like, 'It's a bad thing elephants are endangered, because if there were enough then I'd be able to hunt them as well.' Perhaps the best action would be for him to stop hunting animals while fronting a conservation action - that would be the most politically expedient option. However at that stage it would be seen as just that: PR, and I don't think anyone would be fooled.

But let's not go overboard: the hunting he did was legal, was of a food animal and while it's bad timing it's not something that's going to cause a long term problem. 

The second of the two problems is that Prince William, one of the richest men in the world, is raising an awareness campaign targeted in a large part at some of the poorest people in the world. A man who has enormous wealth is seen to be lecturing the poor that it is bad for them to make money from killing animals while he is going off and hunting for fun. Again, it looks ridiculous. It's a problem that did not need to occur. 

Someone on Prince Williams team should have recognised that this was a bad idea. But it's done now. In the long run I am sure it will be fine, and hopefully they can recognise the image problem this causes and ensure it doesn't happen again. It's important big figures like Prince William raise awareness of the issues and do all they can.",0,1391969932,null,0,false,0,cfb0tfk,t3_1xejkd,t1_cfb0tfk,t3_1xejkd,null,1432322767,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Which is truly unfortunate timing given that Ebay listings are going live tommorrow, Zipzap, and the ATMs last week.

I'm not saying this a cataclysmic death kneel for bitcoin in the UK--though its pretty close to it when speaking about the emergence of cryptoanarchy/cryptocurrency and the decentralization of money--, but one of the key features for adoption is the lower costs associated to accepting btc over fiat. This could have an immediate chilling effect, stagnating any potential the UK.

Sure, he's not the best right winger in the League, and he never really has been anything particularly special, but he always has, and still does, fit into our system perfectly. 

He's a speed merchant. That's all he is. His job is to pick up the ball, run down the field past a few players, and pass it to our midfield/attack to finish with. He's not like Lamela, Bale or Walcott who go on for goal themselves, so that means he's never really scored many and hasn't got much of a higlights reel.

But for our system of fast, attacking &amp; counter-attacking football, he is your perfect player. He gives us width and pace. 

Recently, Walker has been doing better than him at this, and Lamela overall is better than him. So Lennon's usefulness to us is diminishing quite rapidly. Football has changed too, our system has changed, and so I can't see him keeping his place next season. His time is certainly coming to a close.

**General advice**

*Debt*

Don't get into debt. There are some exceptions to this, mostly 

1) Student loans (usually quite reasonable terms, and it often pays off)

2) Mortgage (almost nobody can get save up enough)

3) *Possibly* a car. This is more contentious, but depending on your circumstances can be a good idea.

So a modified version of the rule is ""Don't get into debt without thinking about it extremely carefully"".

Do not take out a payday loan, the amount you pay back for what you borrow is insane.

*Budgeting*

Don't spend more than you earn. Despite the simplicity of this rule, a lot of people do not follow it, which means the complex part is *how*.

1) Make sure you know what you're spending. Very few people actually know. Track your expenses, you can see if you're doing this properly by seeing if you've got exactly as much money as expected in your account at the end of the month. There's software to help with this, but you don't need it, you can do it with a pen and paper.

2) Create a sensible budget. Many sites can help you with this, the MA site I linked to before has one.

3) There will be things you want that you do/buy that you simply cannot afford, understand and accept this.

*Saving*

There are a lot of things here, from just having some cash to investing. 

1) Have an emergency fund, this is supposed to be able to support you for 3-6 months, and smooth over a lot of the bumps in life.

2) Save a regular part of your income

3) Save for a pension. A pension is an investment fund that pays out when you retire, and the earlier you start, the more you'll have.

We can go into more detail on any of these parts if you have more precise questions.

**Specifics: Tax**

Tax is what funds the government, and is generally done by taking a certain percentage of some transaction. Every time you buy something, some portion of that money goes to the government, you have to pay some to have a car ... 

There are many different types of tax. 

One of the major ones you'll pay is *income tax*. This is a tax on how much money you earn. 

The way it works is done in brackets. There is a subtlety that is extremely important to understand that many people don't so hopefully this is clear. (Also I'm going to be rough with these figures, and that these are per year)

* The first £10,000 you earn is not taxed. Woo!

* The next £32,000 you earn is taxed at 20%. Hmm.

* Then next £120,000 you earn is taxed at 40%. Boo.

So, if you're earning £22,000 you're in the 20% tax bracket, but you're not paying 20% tax on all of that, just £12,000. Lots of people don't get this. This is extremely important, as it means that however much you earn, if you earn more **you'll still have more money after tax**. 

Play around with different incomes here: http://listentotaxman.com/

EDIT - Some more details:

&gt; my only outstanding debt is a student loan, which I'm not currently earning enough to be paying off. 

Awesome, don't pay it off early. The student loan you have will be currently growing at 1.5% which is lower than inflation, so is actually shrinking in real terms. In fact, it's limited at growing at the lower of two measures of inflation. 

&gt; My work does provide a pension plan, which is fairly generous.

I'm American, but do watch a lot of panel shows (usually trying to find episodes with people I like and without people I don't). For the record if panel shows existed here they'd pick even worse people to cater to the populous.

If more women aren't learning their craft in the trenches of the comedy clubs then there aren't going to be many women who get good enough to be professionals.

Most people (men and women) who try to be comedians will never be professionals, and since its about 10/1 ratio of men vs women who go into comedy that's roughly what the professional ratio is like.

Therefore when it comes to a television panel show (where there's usually only 4-8 comedians on at any one time) they have a choice.

Neither is it entirely subjective.  There's a skill involved in the art just like any other, and assuming that you could pick some random asshole off the street and watch them perform well on QI or whatever is misinformed.  There are abilities that are required to be a panelist on these shows, and some people are better at them than others.  Also, certain people gel better together.  It's all about creating a panel that will maximize the entertainment on the show, and no, that's not something you can achieve by simply cherry picking your friends or preferences.

&gt;that are popular

I talked about how there are less ""popular"" women comedians in my other post.

edit:  sorry, that was another post, not the one above.  My apologies.

&gt;There's absolutely no reason a single woman shouldn't be included in that.

There's no reason that a woman should be barred for being a woman, that's no doubt true.  But there are reasons that individuals aren't good for those shows, so no you can't just pick random people to do this.  They have to have the talent, they have to be available, and the producer has to be aware of them.  If there aren't any women around that meet those qualifications better than their male counterparts, then yeah, that's a perfectly adequate reason to form an all male panel, just as it's an adequate reason to form an all female panel if the reverse were true.

Now, if producers find that they aren't adequately evaluating female talent, then they should definitely change their practices, because they are missing out on a lot of good talent.  But if they are evaluating female comedians effectively and finding their male counterparts more suitable, then that's who needs to be on the show.",0,1391973574,null,0,false,0,cfb2cjf,t3_1xe5my,t1_cfb2cjf,t1_cfb1s4c,null,1432323565,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

The ratio of men and women comedians who go professional is based on the ratio of men and women who go into comedy in the first place. 

In order for there to be 50/50 male and female professional comedians, women would have to have a much better natural aptitude for comedy than men in order to compensate for the small number of women who go into comedy in the first place.

Are you saying its completely impossible for women to not have an interest in becoming stand up comedians for cultural reasons?

Most nurses in my country are female. Does this mean men are discriminated against and not allowed to be successful nurses? No, it just so happens not many men go into training for nursing so there aren't as many trained nurses as trained women.

I have as much interest in convincing more men to go into nursing as I do convincing more women to go into comedy. If you go into a profession it should be because you want to, not because of your gender.

---

&gt;**Michael ""Mick"" Hucknall** (born 8 June 1960) is an English [pop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music) singer and songwriter. Formerly the lead singer of the modestly successful [punk rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock) band [The Frantic Elevators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frantic_Elevators), Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the [soul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music)-influenced [pop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music) band [Simply Red](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_Red), with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and eventually sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair. He has been described by critic Trevor J. Leeden as ""one of the truly great [blue-eyed soul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-eyed_soul) singers.""

true,IanCal,null,null,"&gt; but I'm not sure how best to actually get started on that.

Put money into a normal savings account or an ISA, one that you're allowed to pull money out of at any time (not locked away for X years). Putting your money *somewhere* is more important than finding the perfect place.

&gt; Is there any chance you could do a quick run-down on the different types of savings account (savings, bonds, ISAs) and maybe a suggestion as to which one would be best for me?

Normal savings:

You put money in, and the bank gives you a small amount of money per year as a reward. The interest you make is taxed like income. Returns are guaranteed.

ISAs:

There are two types, cash and stocks &amp; shares.

A cash isa is just like a normal savings account, but you don't pay tax on the interest. You can only open one per year, and you can only save £5760 per year in them. Returns are guaranteed.

Stocks and shares ISAs are similar to normal investing, but you don't pay tax on the money you make. You can put from £5760 up to £11520 per year in them depending on how much you put in your cash ISA. Returns are *not* guaranteed.

Bonds:

Bonds are you lending money to the government, and are very safe (as the government tends to pay its debts). As they are safe, the return you make is low but steady. You would want to buy these in a stocks and shares ISA. Returns are safe, about as safe as investing gets, but again not guaranteed.

**For you**

This is not proper advice, just to be clear, I'm not qualified and we've not talked in enough detail about this for it to be official advice. (end of legal stuffs)

You probably just want either a cash ISA or a regular savings account. Go with whichever bank gives you the highest interest rate and allows you to withdraw your money quickly. Later on you may want to look at stocks and shares ISAs, but you'll want to understand a lot more and be happy leaving your money in for 10+ years to be more likely to have a good return.

The main reason to focus on FGM alone is quite simple, it's more drastic and it's a bigger problem.

Traditionally, American broadcast network television series' seasons run from Mid-September to May.  A broadcast network TV show will air 22-26 episodes within that period in an irregular but relatively consistent pattern, clustering new episodes at the beginning of the season and for the ""sweeps months"" of November, February, and May, sprinkling reruns in between.   This is fine for episodic series like most sitcoms and procedural dramas, but for dramas that have a strong serial element, it can be frustrating to have the story interrupted by reruns.   So for some broadcast dramas and many cable dramas (which have about half as many episodes per season), it's become customary to air the season in one go, or broken into two uninterrupted halves with a significant gap in between.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The last time people gave a shit in the 30s there was a viable political alternative in communism which many people supported. It forced many governments to embrace social democratic measures, such as high taxation and Keynesian economics in order to humanise capitalism and help spread the wealth it created more fairly. However, these improvements only lasted until the late 70s by which stage advances in technology and globalization had meant that capital could flow more easily across borders and thus was less easy to tax. Now that most nations have embraced the market, we essentially have a global economic system which no one can see past. Hence Maggie's old dictum that there is no alternative. Without a vision of what a different political and economic system could look like, nobody could really be arsed protesting. In most Western nations the only people who protest usually do so for single issues such as environmentalism or wars but rarely to attack the system as a whole. There are still communists, socialists and anarchists who protest regularly, the battle in Seattle famously in 1999 at the WTO meeting and the occupy movement which could be argued was just a continuation of the global justice movement protests rather than anything seperate.

What you have to ask yourself is are you willing to protest for other people as just opposed to yourself. If your wages were going up whilst the vast  majority of peoples were going down would you still feel angry at the system. Most likely not. That is the very strength of this system. Its indiviualises us all to solely think in terms of I as opposed to we. If i'm doing all right then I shouldn't worry. If others aren't doing well then its their own fault. If I'm not doing well then its just my own fault. I should knuckle down and pull myself up by my own bootstraps.

The other thing to note is that wages have been tumbling across the developed world for some time whilst workers in the developing world have seen a rise in their standard of living. It's difficult to protest against a system which many also see as benefitting the less fortunate. More of a case of shut up and accept your crap wage because others in China and India are now doing better because of it. 

This also ties into the price of living debate. It can only rise whilst global demand for goods and services rises. This isn't in any shape or form being explained to the public via the media. We have come to expect cheap food, energy, clothing and goods but much of this was built on ever increasing debt, low wages in the developing world and an abundant supply of cheap fossil fuels.

And from both perspectives it's fundamentally missing the point, which is that you're not hiring an unqualified woman, you're _spending more time looking for a qualified one_.

If the vast majority of candidates for a position are male and you hire the first qualified applicant, you're probably going to hire a guy. That in no way precludes the existence of an equally, or even better qualified female applicant you'd have found if you searched harder or longer.

And that's even before you start to address the well-documented unconscious biases in place that disadvantage women applying for jobs in male-dominated fields. (Google ""blind orchestra auditions"", for example)

&gt; Even when the screen is only used for the preliminary round, it has a powerful impact; researchers have determined that this step alone makes it 50% more likely that a woman will advance to the finals. And the screen has also been demonstrated to be the source of a surge in the number of women being offered positions.

true,violatedchimp,null,null,"&gt;If the vast majority of candidates for a position are male and you hire the first qualified applicant, you're probably going to hire a guy. That in no way precludes the existence of an equally, or even better qualified female applicant you'd have found if you searched harder or longer.

That's my point though.  If the vast majority of candidates are male, then male candidates are going to be chosen the vast majority of the time.  This isn't really an argument for looking for women, it's more an argument for taking the time to look for the most qualified applicant rather than being content with the first one that will work.

&gt;And that's even before you start to address the well-documented unconscious biases in place that disadvantage women applying for jobs in male-dominated fields. (Google ""blind orchestra auditions"", for example)

Again, I'm not saying that these biases don't exist.  I'm saying that attributing the disparity in comedy solely to that is a mistake.

&gt;A similar thing happens when you impose gender-representation quotas on conferences. Far from having to fill slots with under-qualified speakers, conferences suddenly discover that if they'd just spent that extra effort to find them, a whole lot of highly

Well, there's two ways to look at this, and it all depends on how good of a producer you have.  If you have a good producer, he/she will take the time to find the best candidate to fill the requirement, but they should have been doing that anyway.  If you have a bad producer, they will just pick a random person to fill the requirement, because they are lazy or indignant.  So either you have a good producer who is already maximizing talent, or you have a bad producer who is too lazy to find a talented woman anyway.

Also, this is slightly different from software which is a more standardized skill compared to comedy which is in essence an art form.  Since each person's skill set is so unique, at some level, each person will bring a different value to the show, as opposed to having a pool of equally qualified candidates like you would in software.",1,1391978598,null,0,false,0,cfb4i2e,t3_1xe5my,t1_cfb4i2e,t1_cfb48e4,null,1432324580,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Remember they're the party against NHS privatisation, want to work to scrap tuition fees, reintroduce student grants, raising personal allowance, lowering taxes towards the median, protect legal aid. They've got some typically rightwing policies of course, but there's a reason that their core NRS demographic is C2 i.e. skilled working class!

In this case a more social libertarian than fiscal libertarian approach identifies that whilst an insurance company rarely pays out full costs that disparity it felt more by the less well off.  He then argues that culpability lies in an Eton Mess hodgepodge with Gordon Brown making cuts to maintenance of the waterways which never came back, the rise of costs in real terms under this government, and a raft of EU directives which have halted management of the land to protect river critters; such as the Environmental Impact Assessment and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive,  the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive.  Farmers chopping trees to qualify for CAP subsidies doesn't help either, with less water running off treed or wooded land.  

So whilst not directly pointing a finger at any one source it's a pretty strong argument that government is in part responsible for these people losing money and should put its hand in its pocket.

The value of that pot will go up or down as the market rises or falls, meaning the value of each individual's slice will go up or down by the same amount. You can put your slices in your ISA, just like you would put cash there.

Vanguard is just one of many, many, many fund managers. My ISA contains funds managed by Cazenove, Kames, Royal London, Barings and numerous others.

Vanguard is popular because it charges low fees.

true,chunkyknit,null,null,"Just an indication here but my wife and I are putting down 20% on a £132.5k house. We're getting 3.69% fixed for 5 years with Santander. Monthly payments of £541. The more deposit you can raise the better. The figures I looked into for lower deposits has hight interest rates and monthly repayments.

We were encouraged by our independent financial advisor to up our deposit to 20% as it gets us better deals and a much lower fixed rate interest for the initial period of the loan, even if you can't get up to 20% if you can get to 10% you may suddenly find the deals are better.

The bummer will be legal fees and stamp duty, you'll be set for £1300 stamp duty and legal fees if about £1000, you may have mortgage fees of up to £1000 too(these also go down if your deposit is a better proportion of the loan - referred to as loan to value or LTV), plus surveys to do. We couldn't believe what it's costing!

5% mortgages are available with the help to buy scheme but as we got help from my parents we didn't use it. Your earnings will also impact what you can borrow. The bank want to make sure you can keep up payments so they will be very interested in what you earn to make sure you can afford your payments and won't default.

My number 1 piece of advice would be to get yourself and independent financial advisor. They're free and can really help you find the deal that works best for you. Make sure they're truly independent, not tied to any banks or building societies. They claim a fixed rate fee from whatever bank you end up with. I'd happily recommend mine but only good if you're based in Cumbria!

That being said, anything less than 80-90 million pound from Madrid is not to be entertained as we stated that we want more than what they paid for Bale, and rightly so, because Suarez will definitely has a bigger impact.  However, Madrid just broke another transfer record so I think they will wait a while before breaking it again.  We usually have around 20-25 million in transfers without CL, and CL qualification will bring in roughly 30 million (10 million + for making it to stage group, and a share of the TV revenue is usually around 18-20 mil as EPL has high viewership share).  Our total summer spending is likely to be in the 45-50 million in term of transfer fees (rest for contract etc).  We should try to make Cissokho's loan a permanent move (~5 million) if his form doesn't dip.

Little pieces of companies (stock) or lending your money to trustworthy people who will pay it back with interest (bonds) are popular investments as they can be bought and sold easily as well as costing very little to run (vs something like a house).

If you buy these things you will need an account (a bit like a bank account) to hold them in.

ISAs are magic accounts that are invisible to tax collectors and are still legal.

Individual stock and bonds are risky and/or difficult. Many people prefer to buy them in a selection pack (a bit like the mixtures of chocolate bars you like at Christmas) called a fund.

Don't be such a daftie.

You've still yet to tell us how your first week went. I thought of you this weekend when a glass slipped out of my hand and smashed everywhere, fortunately I had an old wine box to put it in before putting it in the bin bag, but I imagine other people aren't quite so thoughtful or are just generally stupid or don't drink enough wine as to have spare empty boxes. Fools, the lot of 'em.

Back down to two wine glasses now folks. The one I smashed was new and pretty too, so I'm a bit pissed off. It's even more annoying when you do these things sober. One minute I'm holding it in my hand, just about to put it down on the side above the fridge to top it up, the next minute my hand apparently forgets how to grip a glass, my hand opened for no reason whatsoever, and then it's smashy no-fun times! Stupid bloody brain/hand :(

VERSE 1

I cross the void beyond the mind

The empty space that circles time.

I see where others stumble blind

To seek a truth they never find.

Eternal wisdom is my guide

I am the Doctor.

VERSE 2

Through cosmic waste the TARDIS flies

To taste the secret source of life.

A presence science can't deny

Exists within, outside, behind

The latitude of the human minds.

I am the Doctor.

VERSE 3

My voyage dissects the course of time

""Who knows?"" you say

But are you right?

Who searches deep to find the light

That glows so darkly in the night

Toward that point I guide my flight.

VERSE 4

As fingers move to end mankind

Metallic teeth begin their grind.

With sword of truth I turn to fight

The satanic powers of the night.

Is your faith before your mind?

Know me. Am I, the Doctor?

I always thought that Coutinho was a bit of a luxury in defence but he proved me wrong against Everton and Arsenal. Oscar is a better goal scorer but Phillipe is a better passer.

Also, not the best measure I'll admit but whoscored.com have rated Coutinho at 8.24 at MC and 7.9 at AMC, his preferred positions and Oscar at 7.2 at AMC and &amp;.92 at AMR for this season.

We couldn't exacerbate anything.

What the party argued previously was that the UK should not only invest much more in coastal and flood defences, they supported investing into it as an potentially exportable industry/specialty.  So there's that.  The UKIP crystal ball strikes again - it doesn't just apply to Europe.

They then argue that their policy will ameliorate the situation because they would repeal the cuts introduced by Gordon Brown and invest what needs to be done to fix the waterways which had always been done until the EU placed an emphasis on conservationism.  That inflation, cut budgets, and well intentioned but impractical policy has left management of the waterways at breaking point and that it is a false economy.

They then argue that more brown field land should be opened up to housing and constraints taken off local authorities so we don't have to build on flood plains so much.     

""350 yrs ago we drained the Fens,       
250 yrs ago we created the canal network,        
150 yrs ago Bazalgette's sewer system.""          

We can dredge a river and create some extra watercourse without losing our shit about how the polar bears are melting.  

If need be we can keep to our foreign aid commitments on clean water, healthcare, meet any humanitarian crisis and still have more than £9bbn to put in a long term patch much like Joseph Bazalgette did.  We can do this.  Simples.

We played long balls and crosses all day long, you might not remember but Jags got into a sort of argument with I think Gerrard because Gerrard accused Everton of playing like Stoke, which Jags took as an insult. But yeah, it wasn't that far off the truth.

I also think this was the reason we let Fellaini go and not Baines, Fellaini didn't fit in with Martinez's system, he was mainly a target man for long balls and crosses, which we do a lot less now, whereas Baines is just quality all the time.

true,JoelDalais,,IBWT (Digital Currency Exchange),"There are businesses (none-exchanges) within the UK that have had issues with banks just because they wished to start accepting Bitcoin. Some of these businesses which have been operating for years already. 

For example, the Isle of Man was going to develop a 'Bitcoin Commemorative Coin', just a gold coin with a Bitcoin design. Last I heard they started having 'issues' just for this.

Also (personally), I call 'bs' and see that its just a convenient excuse. The Blockchain is far more trace-able than fiat is, Bitcoin individuals far more identifiable than fiat users (wait until 0.9 and ssl linkage). If the excuse of fraud/laundering was plausible, then logic dictates that they would quickly throw away fiat and adopt crypto. Yet, because fiat is far more anonymous and less trace-able its by far the primary choice of fraud/money laundering.

Also, money laundering is a fiat concept, it only exists within the Bitcoin economy when Bitcoin crosses over fiat and vice versa. Within a pure Bitcoin economy can money laundering exist? Seeing as its far more trace-able.

Stealing Bitcoins (or illegally gained btc), buying mining gear, then mining Bitcoins is fairly trace-able and would quickly identify an individual.

Would a mixer/tumbler account for laundering? Possibly .. still, there are ways (and more ways will be developed) to trace this to a limit.

When crossing btc &gt; fiat or vice versa, then it becomes far easier to 'launder'.

If there is fault in the system allowing money laundering, then is it just because we must (for now) still touch the fiat world?

The best way to get over the hurdle (of fraud/money laundering) is to do away with fiat. But we all know that's not going to happen any day soon.

&gt;**Liverpool F.C.** qualified for the **2005–06 UEFA Champions League** by a special dispensation from [UEFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA). The English Premier League were allocated four teams for the 2005-6 Champions League season. EUFA allowed Liverpool to compete as champions of the [2004–05 UEFA Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_UEFA_Champions_League), however not allocating an extra place. The selection of the four club's to enter the Champions League was the decision of the [English FA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association). The FA's rule was that the first four in the final English Premier League table would enter the Champions League. The FA were firm on this ruling awarding the fourth and final English place in the competition to Liverpool's [local rivals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_derby) [Everton F.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.), since Everton finished fourth in the [2004–05 FA Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_FA_Premier_League). Liverpool had finished fifth in the table. The public reaction to this decision prompted UEFA to make a one-off exception for Liverpool to enter the tournament as the winners of the Champions League had traditionally entered the tournament the next season to defend the title. UEFA amended the qualification criteria for the [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) winner to enter the subsequent tournament to prevent a recurrence.

Speak to an IFA now, it won't cost you anything and they may know how to get you on the ladder.  It's definitely worth the conversation - please do it! 

The mortgage rates tend to work in bands. The interest you pay will impact the monthly payments and overall affordability. 20% is pretty good, we were looking at the 15% band before and it was still affordable and 10% looked okay but a bit of a stretch. 5% will be harder but don't judge till you see it, and at least it's better than paying someone else's mortgage!(ie rent)

Additionally our position meant we could get a 25 year mortgage but a 35 year would mean lower monthly payments - more immediate affordability. The drawback is you pay more over the life of the loan but whatever the case you'd be putting money away so better then rent.

Speak to an IFA - ask a friend of colleague who bought a house or ask an estate agent, they can make a recommendation. Even if the IFA tell you it's the wrong time they can help you plan towards making it happen.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"Eh, no. After the second Jacobite uprising the Hanovarian government made a concerted effort to suppress aspects of Scottish/Gaelic/Highland life. Owning a bible written in Gaelic, playing the pipes and wearing tartan all became punishable by death (despite the fact the Jacobite rebellion had more to do with religion than Scottishness, but heigh-ho.)

Furthermore, Jacobite chiefs (or at least, those who where not pro-Hanovarians) were arrested and/or executed and replaced with those more favourable to the Hanovarian government. Through the government's breaking up of the clan system, these new chiefs began to regard their role not as a leader and family member, but as a traditional English or Lowland lord, using his clan lands or ""estates"" to fund a move to and life in London, as with the rest of the landed gentry.

Furthermore, it's simply wrong to say that because the English aristocracy was seeded with Scots by James VI that this was how the clan chiefs where made English (or, more accurately, part of the London establishment) because there was a world of difference between James' Lowland Lords and the Highland chiefs, prior to Culloden, with that same James calling them ""barbarians"". The Highlanders at that time, and until fairly recently, where regarded as entirely barbaric, and entirely separate from Lowland Scots, being ""Gaels"".

I don't care if there is a shortage of top level transgender or wheelchair comical talent. Every episode must include at least one of each, no matter how much less funny this makes the show. The pseudo-PC police demands it.""

Do you not see a problem with this way of thinking?

If the overwhelming majority of the best comedians were female then by all rights the panels should and would consist of all or mostly women. The quality of content should always come first. 

The women that do make it on the panels are funny, talanted and have worked their arses off to get there (just like their male counterparts). Lowering standards to pander to arbitrary quotas is not doing anyone any favors.

And you will have to lower standards because right now there are not enough women of that caliber in the industry, shoehorning tier 2-3 comedians onto  tier 1 panels because of this shortage will not fix it. It will only dilute the quality of the show. While sending a message to women that they dont need to be as good or try as hard in order to be as successful as men.

* New DM to challenge Lucas

Then we also have Ilori, Suso, Borini, Wisdom &amp; Assaidi to come back. Also I hope Ibe starts getting game time next season in the cups if nothing else. 
 
Then we'll have nice depth. Ilori and Wisdom to back-up our already very deep defence. Borini to be the 3rd-tier attack with Aspas. Assaidi as a back-up winger although I've heard he might be leaving (possibly with a new winger as well). I have a feeling Suso will be pushing Coutinho/Sterling for their spots too. So he'll be like a new signing.

I just think we need a bit more class in our midfield. We have Suarez (and Sturridge) up front, Agger, Sakho &amp; Skrtel in defence.

Suarez is a fantastic player, no doubt, but you make it sound like without him we're just hopeless or something and recent history has proven that to be completely inaccurate.  We'd also be likely getting some pretty decent players coming in the other way.

The interesting thing about Suarez is he almost never scores game changing goals.  I don't know why, but by and large most of his goals come over lesser opposition we are already drawing with or beating.  For quick comparison, simply removing Suarez's goals and we drop 11 points from where we are, doing the same from Sturridge and we drop 14 points.

The fact of the matter is that we don't have a player who's best ability is his passing, specifically in the offensive third. Mirallas, is not a passer , Lukaku is a terrible passer and right now that isn't part of Barkley's game. For me this is the reason we aren't in fourth place. We can't consistently unlock defenses and it should be our biggest spot to upgrade next summer. This is another reason why Lukaku isn't playing as well. No one is spotting his runs in time and his best moments come on the rush or counter. I'd think our ideal actual striker might be someone like Giroud.

The premise that it takes more effort to find more qualified people in general, but ok.

&gt;then the only way we can know we exerted adequate effort is if we actually found those qualified women

Not true.  You don't know the number of qualified women to start with, so you have no way of knowing whether yielding five qualified women is an exhausted search or a cursory one, since you'll never have the real number to compare it to.  The only way you'll know if you exerted adequate effort is if you actually exerted the effort.

&gt;and if after finding those qualified women we refuse to hire even one of them then we are wasting valuable company resources with nothing in exchange. 

No one is saying that you're refusing to hire a woman.  I'm saying that you can hire a woman to fill a quota without searching for a qualified one.  Instead of expanding your search more and more until a qualified woman enters it, you may deem it easier to just find any woman to meet the quota.

&gt;Sorry, If I am going to be forced to make the effort to find qualified women I am going to hire some of them, and I am going to set quotas to make sure all that effort does not go to waste.

You're making the mistake of assuming that quotas are often met with qualified applicants.  You're also making the mistake of assuming that people tune into television shows to watch ""qualified"" comedians.  They don't.  They tune in to watch the best comedians available, so when I have to expand my list until I find say the 30th best comedian available before I get a woman to fill a quota, a drop in quality occurs.  I'm not saying this is necessarily the case, but since these panels are more often men, it leads me to believe that the best available were men, and forcing them to choose someone who isn't the best available degrades the quality regardless of what gender they are.  In other words, I believe that the people who book these people know comedy better than an arbitrary number chosen by someone trying to make a political statement.",0,1391994065,null,0,false,0,cfbawka,t3_1xe5my,t1_cfbawka,t1_cfba1df,null,1432327652,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,PhilipTheLion,,Hartlepool United,"Being a Poolie, let me stake our case. Colin Cooper is doing an incredible job of turning the team of has beens and journeymen that embarrassed us in League One last year in to a young, exciting squad of real players. We are starting to play real football, on the ground, using the space and passing it around, waiting for the opportunity. Our young squad is learning the beautiful game, and they will only get better at it.

Lads like Luke James and Michael Duckworth are going from strength to strength and they are getting better with each game. They are being supported by some great pros in Neil Austin, Andy Monkhouse and Marlon Harewood too.

In terms of our deadwood, all of their contract should be up in the summer, and that will give Colin some money to spend on new players. Add to the the £500k we made off of the sale of James Baldwin, and we should bring in a few players this summer. His signings have been on the money so far, if he keeps it up we'll be laughing.

If we keep our core of young talent next season, we will have an exciting youthful core, to build around with a few intelligent signings. If we lose any of these players, it is going to be for some big money, and we can afford to rebuild the entire team with the money. 

My only concern is centre back. At the moment we have one recognised centre back on the books, and that is a 36 year old Sam Collins. We also have a lot of loan players in our squad We need two full time signings at least, capable of playing regularly straight away, and some creativity in midfield.

true,PurpleFrogSundance,null,null,"I'm an Aussie who has lived in the UK for 6yrs.  Things to know:

1. As someone else said rightmove.co.uk, zoopla and spareroom.co.uk also sometimes has flats but I've largely used it for share-house accommodation.  You pay council tax in the UK, not the homeowner.  You'll also need a TV licence on the premises, but otherwise, bills are as normal.

2. Aussies working in bars, as you've already seen, is quite the stereotype.  I think Aussies are still generally known though as hard workers so that helps.  Wages in the UK seem a lot lower than Aus - average wage across the UK is only around £18k ( a bit higher in London of course).  However, the phone contract I'd pay AUD65 is £20 here.  So there is that.

3.  I live in London but think the train connections to Staines is really good.  Its not part of the underground but the overground services seem fairly frequent.  Take a look at thetrainline.co.uk 

4. When you get here, you'll need to get a National Insurance number.  Its kinda the same as our Tax File Number in some ways but means you can go to your GP.  You'll need to sign up for a GP (sometimes your closest one won't be taking on new patients, so just keep calling).  Once you're signed up (they may require a 'new patient consultation') you can then go see a GP for free.  The NHS is a great system.

5.  You might get called a convict.  It happens.  The UK grasp on history is a bit longer than ours so convict times seems a lot closer here.  You get used to it. 

6. Slightly odd one here but I'll also add… The short form of Pakistani, while being more of a friendly term to a lot of Australians, is in fact a major racial slur in the UK.  I was warned about this by other Aussies who had sometimes made the mistake of saying it at work and then being ""spoken to"" by HR…!

7.  Drinking.  More drinking.  Drinking.  The damn Heathrow injection.  hahaha When you're in London you drink a lot.  Then you travel throughout Europe and drink and eat some more.  

8.  Pants.  To some people (I think its Northerners… Brits, correct me if I'm wrong) the word 'pants' refers to underpants.  Can lead to giggles.

9.  Queues.  Form the proper queue.  In Sydney you can all stand in a jumble at a shop then just let people order food in the proper order of arrival.  In the UK, a proper queue will be formed.  If you break the queue, expect passive aggressive tuts, disapproving stares and eye rolls

10.  check out /r/britishproblems and have a giggle

This includes the mode of speech, i.e. received pronounciation, and interests such as shooting, hunting, etc. 

It's a type of culture that is not centred around a location, but around an upbringing, and of course, it just so happens that those with the most money are more likely to have been to one of these schools and send their kids to them, continuing the culture. That's why you get the stratification. And you're right, it's the *rich* who come from that sort of background.

Council tax is like rates in Australia (if you own a property).  Its basically what the local council charges for all their hard work, bins, keeping the streets clean etc.  In Aus its absorbed by the homeowner, but in London its by the renter.  A TV licence is how the BBC is partially funded.  If you have a TV on your premises, you need to by a TV licence.  They'll send a letter to the house anyway, don't worry.

I went over on the old Highly Skilled Migrant Programme.  It no longer exists.  One of my biggest frustrations as an Aussie is hearing Aussies talk about the GFC of 2010, like its over.  Its not the case for the rest of the world.  The rest of the world is still recovering and slowly.  One of the impacts is that the borders to the UK have been all but closed.  I'm not sure about ancestry but absolutely apply if you can.  It gives you the most flexibility.  I didn't use lawyers for visa applications (until I started the citizenship process, that is).  Make sure you read the criteria very carefully, read it three times before you complete the application, then once more before you send!

NHS will apply to anyone who is working in the UK.  It definitely did to me when I was under the HSMP visa.

Not all costs scale down.  Some will be more expensive than others.  But honestly, as an ex-Sydney sider, I personally think living in Australia is more expensive.  Cost of bills seem to be higher and day to day living.  When I'm in the UK, I get out maybe £100 in cash from the cashpoint.  In Aus, I get out $300 that seems to disappear.  A McDonalds snack in the UK costs me £3.50, but in Aus is more like AUD8.  I looked at a trip in to Ayers Rock a few years ago that would have cost me about £700 for 4 nights plus flights.  £700 will get you a week in a lot of locations from London...

Oh, another thing that I like about the UK is that you don't have to do a tax return usually.  Tax is taken out of your wage and thats it.  When I was a perm employee, that was a nice change.  I think Aus tax rates are slightly higher too.  

Downside to London of course is the weather.  When I got there (in September) I went to a local charity shop and bought a lovely big winter coat for about £15.  It was awesome and I didn't have anything appropriate from Aus.  The houses are much better heated usually (I always look for the flats with the central heating and try and avoid the ones with wall mounted electric heaters where possible).

By lifting the veil I mean talking to these women in private, finding out what they *really* think. No lip service, no Stockholm syndrome, what they *really* think. 

The Koran apparently says that the burka is NOT a requirement and many women choose NOT to wear the burka but might cover their hair for instance, so why are these women wearing the burka?

Is it really their choice?

Some say they wear it so they aren't judged on appearance and are judged on their words, but is this true? Could it be Stockholm syndrome? 

Do they *really* have a choice? Or is the pressure so great by their male family, they wear it just to please them?


This can only be answered by lifting the veil. Banning is just a quick and easy option. That won't do. We have to dig deeper. We have to get inside their minds of and the minds of their family and culture, we have to find out what is really going on here. Banning is a bandaid. It is not the right way to go about it. It's cheap. We need to gain a better understand, we have to lift the veil. 

We have to find out what these women really think, free from the watchful eye of their family, free from the repercussions of their confession. Ironically, anonymity might prove to be the best course here. ",0,1391998560,null,0,1391998754,0,cfbcpzb,t3_1x65bg,t1_cfbcpzb,t3_1x65bg,null,1432328521,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The number of circumcised males in the US is far higher than the total Jewish population, male and female, of the planet for example. And not all Jews are circumcised or support the practice. 

As for FGM, it's a practice that pre-dates Islam (there are references to the practice dating back nearly 4000 years), and although the practice is linked with Islam it's not actually mandated by Islam and there are views ranging from forbidden to mandatory depending the Islamic jurisprudence in question. In some cases, it's Christians more than Muslims who do it.

The actual truth is that it's a combination of local interpretations of religion, tribal tradition,  and views on chastity and beauty that are utterly alien to us. In short, a complex problem.

true,canyoufeelme,null,null,"I was on the fence with MJ for many years. I now do not believe he was a pedophile. I think he was just incredibly naive and ironically; incredibly innocent to the point it was seriously detrimental.

MJ was not a sexual person. Watch any interview where sex is mentioned; you can clearly see he is repulsed by the idea of sex in general. His face says it all. In one interview he talks about how his brothers would bring girls to his hotel room during the Jackson 5 days while he was a kid, and his face says it all. Sex was not something he liked. 

I think he was either asexual or possibly homosexual and closeted, but probably asexual. Throughout his entire life, he was not a sexual person. If you watch interviews from the 80s, before the scandal hit, you can see sex is clearly not something he likes. His face says it all. His kids were not conceived through intercourse, and his wives and girlfriends were clearly not very significant to him. His relationships with women were so very clearly fake and for show. 

I think MJ was a naive man, with little or no sexual impulse, and because of his childhood, the abuse he suffered, and the fact his life and uprbringing was seriously detatched from the average person's experience, he genuinly thought sleeping in the same bed with kids was not a big deal. MJ  never really grew up, he remained a child throughout his entire life, and when you combine that with his asexual nature, you can see how he thought sleepovers with kids was not really a big deal. 

The reason he didn't see it as a big deal was because he did not have a dirty mind. He did not have a sexual mind. Most people *do* have dirty minds, and most people *do* have sexual minds, so *they* made that connection. They turned it into a sexual thing, not him. 

To him it was like ""we shared a bed, so?"" sex didn't even factor into it because he was not a sexual person. Obviously most people are quite sexual, so they immediately made the sexual connection, and the rest is history.

As for FGM, it's illegal to do, illegal to take a child abroad to do it and illegal to help someone do it. The problem is that it's still done, for reasons that are not easy to solve. Some cultures view not doing it as abhorrent, and there are consequences for women who don't have it done. The issue is that people have come to the UK and still hold those views, or have regular contact with or travel to places where people still hold those views.

The important thing to understand here is that the views you hold and indeed the way you think are not universal. It is important to understand the differences in order to identify the best ways of changing peoples minds, because simply talking about western morality or consent makes as much sense to the proponents of FGM as a Space Shuttle manual written in Kartvelian would make to you.

Adipose were never my favorite but, again, it was a case of making something cute into something really scary and dangerous.

As for the Sontarans, I love them, especially Strax. I don't consider them silly as much as a commentary on societies that have rigid rules and social structures and practice group-think. Then, with that established, as Strax tries to learn aspects of human society and keeps getting them wrong, it is comic relief, but it's got a lot of background behind it.

I haven't priced the Moto G properly (it looks like you can get it cheaper at Tesco, for example) but Amazon list the 16gb version for £30 more than the 8gb version. I'm seeing 16GB microSD cards for £6 + VAT? 

I'm also inclined to prefer removable and spare batteries. 

If you have friends or family on different networks, then I think you could save money by use the THL's dual-SIMs to benefit from free minutes and optimal tariffs. Personally, I'm unlikely to use that.

I suppose that in retrospect I might have been better off buying the Moto G, using it for most of this year and then flogging it. You'll get a better price for a Moto G secondhand than I'll ever get selling my THL, so the Moto G will give a lower total-cost-of-ownership if you're trading up in a few months.

I had to look up the Moto G in order to reply to you, but the TechRadar review of it complained about the camera - the W200's camera has impressed me with its image quality, but only in good light.

Finally, depending on the price differential, I'd rather have the THL's larger screen (and it also looks like the THL's CPU is a bit faster) but I'm a bit jealous that the Moto has Android 4.4.
