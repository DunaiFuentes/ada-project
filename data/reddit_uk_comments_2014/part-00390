I preformed all the checks I know in and out and couldn't fix the problem. So I phone BT because through my troubleshooting I've identified that an Openreach Engineer is required to investigate further.

I call and I get a foreign call center, I explain the issue very clearly. Noise on phone line/intermittent BB and immediately I got the response of, that's normal it'll go away on it's own within a few days. A bit astonish I explain again thinking that he simply misunderstood me and I got the same response. Immediately I recognized that this person has no desire to take on any responsibility, maybe I could argue and get him to do his job correctly but it could take an hour to get the job done.

So I hang up and call again, expecting a foreign call center but maybe someone willing to help. Instead I get an English call center, I explain the problem. We quickly gain an understanding of each other, I tell him what I've done and he makes sure I've not missed anything on the checklist and within 7 minutes that's the Engineer booked. Not for an external fault picked up on the line test, for a clean line test that picked up nothing.

&gt;__Last Thursdayism__ is a similar response to omphalism which posits that, by the same logic, the world might have been created last Thursday (or by implication, on any other given date and time), but with the appearance of age: people's memories, history books, fossils, light already on the way from distant stars, and so forth. It is aimed at the logic point that when this logic is permitted, it can be used to prove any ""fixed date creation"" schema. The first known reference is on November 2, 1992, in a [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) post titled ""Last Thursdayism proven!"", responding to an apocalyptic prediction:

I'll focus on 3 and 4, since I have a friend in Liverpool who was able to get me tickets and we grabbed a drink at a bar near Goodison beforehand, so I don't have much to tell you about that stuff.

Try to sit in the Lower Gwladys – it might be hard to get ""unobstructed"" seats, but our ""obstructed"" seats weren't particularly obstructed. It was a little difficult to see the far corner but honestly, how much happens in the far corner? The fans are the most intense there, with a lot of singing and standing (in the second half, whenever Everton was in their attacking half, we'd stand). Lots of shouting, ""Come on you blue boys!"" and if the game isn't going so well, angry cursing as well. If you consider yourself to be on the more intense of the fan spectrum, you'll enjoy it.

Honestly, nobody had too much to say to us. At the bar before the game, some guy said I looked like Luis Suarez and then laughed when I said I hated Suarez. I sat with a group of three other Americans (my girlfriend and two of my friends) and people didn't really seem to care about us, even though I was the only Everton fan/the only one singing along. I had a nice chat with the two guys sitting next to me at halftime who asked me about whether I followed the NFL (I don't, they were disappointed, clearly wanted to chat about it), and they seemed to think it was pretty cool that I knew so much about the team. They said something to the effect that it was awesome/weird to think that people around the world cared so much about their community club.

The biggest hurdle is the Scouse accent – I couldn't understand half the people I talked to over the course of my weekend in Liverpool. This led to a bunch of awkward ""Sorry, I missed that"" ""Repeat that again?"" *laughing to pretend I understood what they said* moments.

2. Before the game I hung out in the fan zone which was nice, but I bet there is a good bar you can go to beforehand. However, go inside as soon as the ground opens, because it was and will always be one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Seeing Goodison in real life is like nothing I have ever witnessed. It truly takes your breath away.

3. I watched the game from the Gwladys Street section which is known for the die-hard fans. However, the view was not as good as a seat on the long touch lines. You trade the atmosphere for the view. Got to talk to Timmy before the match behind the goal which was great. 

4. The fans were nice. I had a drunk couple next to me that talked my ear off but besides that I really enjoyed the game. You will definitely see a lot of emotion.

Fun Fact: My cab driver to the stadium was Seamus Coleman's cousin!

I hope I could help.

You shouldn't have a problem getting tickets for that games. It's only the ""bigger"" games like United and Liverpool where you'll find a problem.

I'm usually in the Winslow before the game for a few drinks, it's a decent proper blue pub. I'm there for a few after as well but there are plenty places to drink full of blues and away fans alike. Eating isn't great around Goodison as it's mostly just Chinese food or the chippy next to the Main stand.

Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard is doubtful after injuring his ankle during the victory at Stoke.

Oscar could be recalled to the starting line-up after only being named as an unused substitute on Monday.

West Ham midfielder Mark Noble returns to the squad after recovering from an Achilles problem.

Defender James Tomkins is the Hammers' only injury doubt after he was substituted against Leicester with a hamstring problem.


**Head-to-head**

West Ham have not won on any of their last eight league visits to Stamford Bridge (D2, L6).

The Hammers' last win at Chelsea was in September 2002, when Paolo Di Canio scored twice to propel West Ham to a 3-2 win.

Their only previous Boxing Day meeting came in 1973 when Ron Greenwood's Hammers won 4-2 at Stamford Bridge despite being 2-0 down at half-time - the scorers included Frank Lampard Sr.

**Chelsea**

Chelsea have won all eight of their Premier League home matches this season.

The Blues are unbeaten in their last nine Boxing Day games (W5, D4).

Diego Costa has scored eight goals in his seven Premier League appearances at Stamford Bridge this season.

This is the eighth time that a club managed by Jose Mourinho has been top of the league at Christmas. On the previous seven occasions (with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid), he has gone on to win the title. *(Good omen?)*

**West Ham**

West Ham have won four of their last five Premier League matches.

The last time the Hammers were in the top four of the top-flight on Christmas Day was back in 1985. They finished that season in third.

West Ham have already won nine matches this season - they only won 11 in total in the whole of the 2013-14 campaign.

The Hammers have scored in their last eight Premier League away games. The last time they scored in nine away games in a row was back in December 1999-May 2000 (nine matches).

false,purplepooppants,null,null,"To understand the position of London in British society, consider typical middle class British life in four phases:

1. 00-18 Grow up in home counties/the country
2. 18-21 Go to University anywhere good
3. 21-35 Go to London to start a career
4. 35-   Move back to home counties/the country to start a family

In London, the ""stage 3"" people are prevalent, and that's what makes it so oppressive if you're not in that stage of life yourself.  Really, it's awful, and the people are awful.  They strut around like it's just *unthinkable* to be anywhere but London, when in reality they themselves will spend most of their lives elsewhere, once they've grown up a bit and realised that there are more important things in life.

A key realisation is that the expensive professional London can't exist without the countryside to bring up its children, and without the universities to educate them -- we can't just build a wall around the thing and treat it as a separate entity.  It's a bit like some US states with uber-low taxes (especially Texas), that get away with it because all their workers were educated in other states and moved there.

However, the picture of the self important office worker cramming into the tube in his suit doesn't represent ""Londoners"" as such, i.e. people who are actually *from* London and will live there their whole lives.  Those people, meh, no particular opinion about them.  Same as ""the locals"" anywhere else in the UK, they are generally underrepresented and ignored compared with the non-regional-accented white collar demographics that dominate british society (it's not right, but it's true).

I *do* think more government departments should be spread out around the country.  The prevalence of relatively senior government jobs in London has a distorting effect.  The BBC especially should continue to move its operations out of London, as part of its job is to represent british culture in general, rather than being part of the goverment-finance mothership.",0,1419498277,null,0,false,0,cn4x016,t3_2qbcdz,t1_cn4x016,t3_2qbcdz,null,1425224707,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12

http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0001/5702/rcchance.pdf) is a few years old but still relevant. Challenges some of the common assumptions.

&gt;Only a third had chosen to come to the UK and the factors influencing this decision reflect colonial, historical and linguistic links, the presence of family members and a general perception of the UK as a safe and politically stable country. For others, the decision about where to seek asylum was made by others, most commonly an increasingly complex network of agents and facilitators. For this group, who represent the majority of those who participated in the research, policies here in the UK had no impact. 

My understanding is that the French authorities (and other European countries) have started ""cracking down"" on asylum seekers more and more in the years since that was published. There is a very lengthy processing time for asylum in France and the applicant might well be homeless without the ability to legally work, which is obviously not ideal. Refugees and asylum seekers also report much grief from the police. I think in general there is this coercion to either go back to X or try to go onward to the UK.

&gt;

&gt;The __Blinovitch Limitation Effect__ is a [fictional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional) principle of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) physics in the universe of the long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*.

&gt;It is usually understood as having two aspects: firstly, that a time traveller cannot ""redo"" an act that he has previously committed, and secondly, that a dangerous energy discharge will result if two temporal versions of the same person come into contact. The first aspect is similar to a real-world physics conjecture, the [Novikov self-consistency principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle).

Don't buy into what Brendan keeps saying every time we concede a goal, that it's because of decision-making of individual players. That in itself is a very flawed concept like they discussed on MNF, you need organization, teamwork and most of all good coaching. 

Brendan keeps saying how he's an amazing coach and that he will always improve players. Well I believe him but whether he's a good manager remains to be seen yet. If you really think about it, this season is his first real test as a proper manager. You have to manage a large squad, you have to manage large expectations (because of last season), you have to manage different competitions (especially Europe which he has never done before), so you can't just focus on the league and play one game per week with plenty of coaching and training time to prepare in between.

This season is the real deal and so far he is failing on all fronts if you ask me. Just look at the facts like Rafa would. He failed to attract any big players for a number of transfer windows now and basically failed every time to actually get our #1 target. We are already out of the Champions League despite a very easy group, say what you will about the likes of Basel and Ludogorets but it's unacceptable that we get outplayed on Anfield by both. We are still alive in the Capital Cup but I think that's down to the fact that we haven't really faced a serious opponent yet. Meanwhile in the league we're pretty close to giving up on 4th already at Xmas with the worst league start in 50 odd years. I especially don't like the way that he is handling the Mignolet situation, I think he has made a complete mess of that. His squad rotations this season don't make much sense to me either, he keeps changing players while ""punishing"" others for mistakes etc. If he keeps doing that he will lose the dressing room completely.

The real question is, should Brendan be given another chance next season? I guess only John Henry knows the answer to that one. But let's say we end up with no European footy whatsoever next season like in his first season in charge. If given another chance I think he will again do well and get back into the top 4 and everyone will think that he has redeemed himself but that's not enough for me, you have to stay in the top 4 because that's the hard part.

Brendan for me last season was the Messiah that I thought was here to finally deliver us from mediocrity. I thought that the way that we played and attacked was down to his coaching philosophy and nothing else, but it's more and more evident that it was mostly down to the ""Suarez effect"". The little ""cannibal"" inspired everyone around him and got the best out of Sturridge and Sterling and almost single-handedly won us the league. 

My own faith in Brendan is rapidly fading, I don't like how he keeps dodging responsibility (always indirectly blames players and drops them as punishment) when his own position comes under threat. I can't be the only one that noticed how his demeanor has changed in press conferences lately. He says that we're officially ""back on track"" because we're creating loads of chances, but errr we're playing with 6 creative midfielders and no strikers so that should be a given? SIX creative midfielders (Sterling, Lallana, Markovic, Coutinho, Gerrard and Henderson) is quite literally more than half the team. Doesn't really look to me like we're back on track at all, just looks like he is getting a bit creative so that it may appear that way to others (buying time for himself to fix issues and wait for Studge). We are quite literally playing with no fullbacks, no strikers and no goalkeeper. I think he has completely lost it, at least tactically.

mason for one, is a capable forward passer. our only one at that. the evidence in this is his 80% forward pass completion rate, a number we haven't had as high in our CM's since modric left.

have you not noticed how much quicker our tempo is since Mason has come in? how much better we are moving the ball forward? did you not notice how for the past year or so how slow and pedestrian our midfield has been? do you not remember how many times we have been pulling our hair out because dembele and paulinho waddle around the centre circle with the ball at their feet because they don't know what to do? mason has been instrumental in this change because he receives it, looks up and makes an incisive pass off.

he is nowhere near modric, never will be, modric is one of the best in the world however he is the type of midfielder we have been crying out for since modric left. he finds those pockets of space. holtby? the man who 3 managers didn't rate enough? the man that barely pulled up any trees at fulham bar a couple of hollywood passes? please.

Time travel seems to create a barrier against paradox on some level as we've seen the doctor meet himself countless times, touch himself, and so on as well as other companions (Amy  meets an alternate/older self). So perhaps it is more that temporal continuity operates on an alternate timeline=alternate dimension model instead of 1+1=boom, which would explain several paradoxical meetings in its history. The difference is subtle, but even when events are changed, the timeline reasserts itself by making people forget events that were asynchronous to established history (the 50th where they literally rewrite the doctor's own history for example where he says 'i'll remember none of this'). I think what sets Rose's interaction with her father is that the event changed MORE than just her personal history, it changed everyone in her family and friends timelines at the same time. In the case of NOT blowing up Gallifrey, the other timelines ended with that explosion like any other potentially cataclysmic event on any other world, the doctor was able to muck about and change it for everyone. If anything it says you can change time for the greater good but not for selfish reasons (namely saving your dad decades after he died because you wanted to meet him). Too much time had already passed for that timeline to not splinter off when that happened. Conversely, the time war was time locked in a single moment, which opens up whole theoretical possibilities including what the doctor did never happened because it never rejoined time in the proper sense. By changing that and then removing Gallifrey from this universe, any potential paradox was neatly averted. 

To summarize:  Rose was selfish and thoughtless (and her dad was a fixed point in time). You can meet yourself without blowing up if you don't muck about in your own timeline (unless you are a timelord).

But I do have good news welshdragon2011.  When I ""distracted"" the driver, he was around 10 meters from the bus stop, his speed was around walking pace.  So you can relax.  The happiness and focus of the bus driver on the previously stated, calm and empty road, went pretty much unmolested.   

However, I am dismayed to hear the bus driver is paid to help return property to people, as this means he wasn't doing his job.  All he had to do was stop and the situation would have been resolved within 20 seconds.  A ladies day would also have not been ruined, and also the Bus company, would not have had negative press.

Regarding grumpiness, I disagree that ones job entitles them to be unhelpful and grumpy.  Perhaps if you were had experienced other cultures you maybe aware of individuals working in terrible jobs, who are still happy to help others in need.

Pointing out that the driver was upset because of traffic also does nothing to add to the conversation, as previously stated there was no traffic, so the point is mute.

Pointing out it is not my responsibility to hand property back to people states an inability to empathise and a lack of understanding of the context.

Finally, you clearly unhelpful, biased and ignorant comment, raises the clear question of why you would willingly make it, as anyone could see the logical fallacies inherent within it.  

One can only get the suspicion you are attempting to improve the perception of the bus company. Which leads one to hope you don't work in any PR related capacity.

 Yeah, I am aware of that, and I would also never buy Beats since they're too expensive etc..., but I would also never judge someone for wearing pair of fucking headphones.

 With these sort of things you also pay for brand, and for their marketing promotion costs which is also accounted in overall cost of every product.

 Do you also shit on everyone who wears branded clothing since they pay 30-40% more just to be a walking billboard, which is like 90% of people in developed countries?

 And yeah, some people probably buy Beats as a fashion accessory since they look cool IMO, very minimalistic and straight to the point, come in various styles and colors, so I don't see what is the problem.

&gt;__Christmas pudding__ is a type of [pudding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudding) traditionally served as part of the [Christmas dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_dinner). It has its origins in [medieval England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_England), and is sometimes known as __plum pudding__ or __Christmas Pudding__ or just ""pud"",   though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit. Despite the name ""plum pudding,"" the pudding contains no actual plums due to the pre-Victorian use of the word ""[plums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plums)"" as a term for raisins. The pudding is composed of many dried fruits held together by egg and [suet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suet), sometimes moistened by [treacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treacle) or [molasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molasses) and flavoured with [cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon), [nutmeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmeg), [cloves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloves), [ginger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger), and other spices. The pudding is aged for a month or even a year; the high alcohol content of the pudding prevents it from spoiling during this time.

&gt;
In addition to looking at different technologies, we heard that a different choice of fuel
cycle might also warrant consideration. Thorium fuel for example has been “successfully
demonstrated in over 20 reactors worldwide, including the UK’s High Temperature
‘Dragon’ Reactor which operated at Winfrith from 1966 to 1973”.

&gt;
In our
Building New
Nuclear
report, we explained that thorium has several advantages including that it is more
abundant than uranium and that thorium fuel cycles are intrinsically more proliferation
resistant as the spent fuel is more difficult to use for nuclear weapons.

&gt;A more detailed
appraisal of the pros and cons of using thorium is set out in the evidence we received.

&gt;Despite the potential advantages of using a thorium fuel cycle, we heard from Dame
Sue Ion, Chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board (NIRAB), and
Dr Fiona Rayment, Director of Fuel Cycle Solutions at the National Nuclear Laboratory
(NNL), that the price of uranium would be the key to triggering a change from uranium
to thorium fuel cycles.


&gt;Dr Rayment added that:
What we have here in the UK at this moment in time is an infrastructure that is
very suitable for a uranium fuel cycle. A lot of the skills and expertise, and also
the facilities that are in place all understand how that fuel cycle can operate.
That being said, that does not mean that at some point in the future a thorium
fuel cycle isn’t something that we should perhaps consider should uranium
prices go up by a significant amount and new build going up by a significant
amount as well.

&gt;Dr Rayment also acknowledged that countries sitting on large thorium reserves, for
example China and India, were looking at thorium from an energy perspective and that it
was important for the UK to participate actively in collaborative research with international
partners.

&gt;This might help to ensure that the UK would be in a position to accelerate
deployment if that should be the likely route in the future.

&gt;The Rt Hon Matthew Hancock
MP, Minister of State for Energy, stated that he would be “open-minded” to industry
developed reactors based on different fuels.

&gt;There are a number of advantages to switching to a thorium fuel cycle; however,
the evidence we have heard suggests that this will not be a viable option unless the price
of uranium changes drastically. The UK must for now remain an active participant in
thorium research and development. We recommend that the Government commission
a study to confirm the potential benefits of thorium in the longer-term and how any
potential barriers to its use might be overcome.",0,1419528632,null,0,false,0,cn53s9u,t3_2qdi1y,t1_cn53s9u,t3_2qdi1y,null,1425221470,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

False, as someone from Belfast who loves reading tourists' experiences of my city, they *always* praise the friendly people and banter that exists in this city.

As an example, I was out with a few friends about a month ago and these two Candian fellas come up asking for: ""that bar with the big beer garden?""  And me and my mates walk them up to Filthy's which was only a few minutes away but we talked, learnt a bit about them, and they about us, and continue on our merry way.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think your average Londoner would do that, they always seem to be in such a hurry to catch the tube, or not miss out on their daily danderings.

Perhaps you were talking about living in London, which I can't attest for, but aye, there ya go.

The rest of what you're saying is stuff that DOES take time to adapt to. If a manager has never manage European games, then no one should expect him to be savvy at it. It should be understood that he will get his tactics wrong, make poor subs, and have difficulty with the starting XI. Also, he has had to introduce several new players, some, new and old, have been injured. He tried to replicate some of the attacking last season, but realized that Gerrard can't do it by himself, albeit a little too late. Like I said, him or whomever should have looked at Sturridge's injury record and chosen a striker that simulates his style of play instead of getting Balotelli, whom I think was bought to compliment him, instead of replicate his dangerous running style when he is injured. 

Regarding the set piece marking and individual errors, I don't know where the blame lies. Almost every goal we concede seems to be due to concentration issues and/or communication. The communication issues could be down to using adjusting different formations or lack of trust in the goal keeper and other defenders around you.

Other favourites include A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie, Big Train, obviously the Fast Show was absolute genius, Chappelle's Show, League of Gentlemen, Harry &amp; Paul is very good, but my favourite sketch show ever made, and here I'm going to get cringe-inducingly pretentious about a TV show but bear with me, is [Mr. Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ6IqF8cqQ8). It was high-concept, it was multi-layered, it was chaotic and often very meta and self-aware, it was brilliantly written and performed, it features a lot of what are now some of the top comedic performers in America when they were unknowns, and it's in my opinion very British (for an American show) in its quirky surrealism.

The alternative is just opening the door for miscarriages of justice - people being locked away because people in various parts of the court system might deem them to be the type of person who would commit a particular crime and react accordingly. Sex offences, since they often inspire very strong emotional reactions against the perpetrators, are probably *more* likely to cause such miscarriages than most normal crimes.

I like the European models that I have experienced. The Belgian and Spanish systems seem to be able to combine affordable private care and free care for the vulnerable quite well.

I suspect the NHS is so big (3rd biggest employer in world) that it dominates the market, and through poor administration has bloated costs, which ends up squeezing our private sector into something reserved for the more affluent, when really it should be something that everybody can afford.

She suffered from being the object of her first season making all her development 'Why is she?' as opposed to 'Who is she?'; last season she was dragged down by poor writing (her character and motivation was so inconsistent) but I still maintain Clara, in a decently written episode, is a great companion.

Remember Daleklara.
The Bar Wench who was also a Nanny.
""Flatline"".

She offers an intelligence and yet cold streak that no other NuWho companion has - she's kinda like a mini-Capaldi-Doctor. With breasts.

Don't hate her because of poor writing - I fear last season would've made any character (except for Capaldi because he's incredible) look bad, and especially any companion.  
Replacing her now and getting a new companion would lead to one of two outcomes, in my opinion:

Either the show continues it's indecisive living, trying to appeal to everyone while not offending or confusing anyone and suffers accordingly, in which case the new companion will seem as terrible as people find Clara; 
Or, the show picks up and the new companion is loved - in which case Clara remaining as a companion may well serve to make people like her more...

3. (I lied) I'm kidding, of course, but it's remarkably similar. I had a recurring nightmare after playing Half Life at age 7 in which I got attacked by a headcrab, then 'woke up' into what turned out to be another nightmare, and the same thing repeated several times until I finally woke up IRL.

""The prime site building is owned by Greencap Ltd, a company registered in Jersey and which, according to the accounts it filed earlier this year, is valued at just £9. Until June 2013 it was leased to RBS. Greencap had obtained an emergency, no-notice injunction to remove them from the premises.""

""Danny Freeman, 22 and his girlfriend, known as Mouse, 21, clambered onto a 10-metre high balcony above the entrance to the building. They remained there in freezing temperatures for 10 hours and **only agreed to leave their spot after news was relayed to them from protestors on the ground that a variation to the injunction had been granted by an out-of-hours high court judge allowing them to return to the building.**

**However, police refused to allow them back into the building** – although Scotland Yard declined to comment about the reason for this. Just after midnight a police officer read out a new court order to the assembled protestors which overturned the one allowing them to temporarily return to the building. The order said that to re-enter the building would constitute contempt of court.

As soon as Freeman and Mouse left the balcony they were arrested, held in police cells for six hours and then released without charge. **All their belongings remain in the former bank and they said they were forced to sleep on the streets on Wednesday evening without any blankets.**""

Clara has been on the show for a very long time now. She's a good character, but we need a new companion ASAP. I really hope she's over Danny Pink, but something tells me that's not the case.

I'll admit, I didn't enjoy series 8 as much as I enjoyed previous series, but I sure as hell wouldn't describe it as shit.

If anything, I think the reason this series hasn't been as well received is because of how different they have made 12 to the 3 Doctors before him - 9 is a bit more of a serious doctor than 10 and 11 but is still considered cheery compared to 12. 

But of course, it's much easier to pass it off as shit and hate it just because it's different from what we've grown used to.

The story was entertaining, once the dreaming had been revealed, although it's obviously very inception-inspired (critics might say it's very derivative in that regard).

It should have ended with the scene where Clara was old, and they were celebrating Christmas together.

I have nothing against Coleman, but it's clear Clara isn't a well-written character. She needs to go.  Having said that, if the problem is with the writing a new companion might not change much.

false,arselona,null,null,"While it would be foolhardy too for me to claim to be a total expert on the Belgian and Spanish systems, my understanding is that there is a fairer balance between public and private than we have (Spain), and more creativity in structure (Belgium).

Spain operates a standard state funded healthcare service, but it has not ballooned to the size of the NHS and so does not monopolise the market and squeeze the private sector costs. Its considered very normal for most people to have private healthcare insurance as the costs are quite reasonable. State healthcare is generally for those who need it.

Belgium is primarily state funded, operating a system of mutuals - but the catch is that there is high levels of competition between the mutuals (who receive funding based on the number of membership). People pay at the point of use, and are reimbursed 50-75% of the cost, with the rest covered by private insurance which tends to be reasonable.

In the UK, we have a pretty restrictive combination. Using Spain and Belgium as alternative examples, I think its quite striking how few options we have. We have but one vanilla state service, and relatively few private sector options.

I don't mean to single you out, but you did highlight America as the alternative to the NHS, but I tend to find this view as quite frustrating as there are many alternatives out there which could work.

My biggest gripe is that healthcare is so important, but we leave it to politicians who:

1) generally have no real world experience, and lack the authority to efficiently allocate capital.
2) will say and do whatever is deemed necessary to win the next election.
3) work on a 4-5 year horizon which handicaps efficient long term decision making.
4) are probably the most untrustworthy profession out there.

Competition does necessarily have to mean privatisation and involving the private sector doesn't mean we have to go anywhere near the American model.

I found [this](http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2011/may/11/european-healthcare-services-belgium-france-germany-sweden) while double checking - you may find it interesting.

Loved Nick Frost as Santa, and I would have much preferred a story with more of him being real in some way, or leaving the Doctor with a clue about Gallifrey, or something that gets us eager for Series 9. 

I won't repeat what's been said about the Inception rip off. It simply left us laughing at it the more dream levels were revealed.

I just hope Moffat stops building up these huge stories or reveals, only to come to a disappointing reveal. 

New mastermind antagonist that's gathering dead people and somehow following Clara?..... The Master reborn with a poor plan and no mention of why she's been meddling with Clara.

Santa Claus is real?!?!.....Naah, it's just a dream.

Clara is some impossible girl appearing in such random places and times? .... All pretty much forgotten and has no meaning anymore.

Clara getting a bittersweet yet logical departure?... Sod Danny and Clara being done for the hundredth time, Clara is back in the Tardis because.... well..... Moffat has a hard on for her I guess?

Rant over, and I apologise to those who enjoy this set up, but I feel that Capaldi is being wasted. He was supposed to be the old mad man in a box again, now he's just Clara's chaperone. They may as well rename the show ""Doctor Clara"" and be done with it.

&gt;A __false awakening__ is a vivid and convincing [dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream) about [awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness) from [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep), while the dreamer in reality continues to sleep. After a false awakening, subjects often dream they are performing daily morning rituals such as cooking, cleaning and eating. A subset of false awakenings, namely those in which one dreams that one has awoken from sleep that featured dreams, take on aspects of a __double dream__ or a __dream within a dream__. A classic example is the double false awakening of the protagonist in [Gogol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol)'s *[Portrait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Portrait_(short_story\))* (1835).

false,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"George Orwell argued this in his defence of the British Monarchy in the wake of the Abdication of Edward VIII, he saw our Constitutional Monarchy as acting as a barrier between the Democratic Socialism that he espoused and the very un-democratic extremes of communism, or 'national socialism'/fascism. Primarily because it acts to separate the presentation of power from the wielding of power. The person wearing the golden crown and receiving the adulation of crowds isn't the person who is making policy decisions behind the scenes. Politicians in Britain can't be taken seriously if they claim any sort of leadership status beyond their democratic mandate, because our head of State, the symbol of our nation, is always above them in the social hierarchy. Everyone, no matter how grand they may be, is a subject of the Monarch, who themselves are restrained by constitutional laws, traditions and the need to keep on the right side of mass public opinion,  and in that way it is a great equaliser.  


Here's the key part from that essay: 

""The function of the King in promoting stability and acting as a sort of keystone in a non-democratic society is, of course, obvious. But he also has, or can have, the function of acting as an escape-valve for dangerous emotions. A French journalist said to me once that the monarchy was one of the things that have saved Britain from Fascism. What he meant was that modern people can’t, apparently, get along without drums, flags and loyalty parades, and that it is better that they should tie their leader-worship onto some figure who has no real power. In a dictatorship the power and the glory belong to the same person. In England the real power belongs to unprepossessing men in bowler hats: the creature who rides in a gilded coach behind soldiers in steel breast-plates is really a waxwork. It is at any rate possible that while this division of function exists a Hitler or a Stalin cannot come to power.""

Note that this is just a defence of our current system of Constitutional Monarchy where there is a very firm dividing line between the symbolic Monarch's role as reigning head of state and Parliament's role doing the actual ruling. It's not a defence of any system where the Monarch would be involved in drafting laws etc. ",0,1419546494,null,0,1419599811,0,cn5atfg,t3_2qdrzc,t1_cn5atfg,t1_cn59zw9,null,1425218136,107,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,107

Honestly, if someone gave me the opportunity to be king I would turn it down, not in a 'I'm on reddit and I will say anything for karma' kind of way (though I accept that's exactly what you'd expect me to say). 

You wouldn't live a normal life. No quiet family holidays, no joy in a evening out, a promotion or nice possessions you earned for yourself; you have a full time job from birth and you have basically everything there is to have and most of it's not even your's. No real friends, no real purpose in life other than to be a walking photo op and people tell you you're a horrid anachronism (which you know you are) that should be abolished, every day. Oh and if you get married, have a divorce, have a child, buy a house, go on holiday, go to a party - anything and you entire life story will be dragged out in the press and ""people will dissect us till this doesn't mean a thing anymore"" to quote a band I used to listen to - and they some French prick paparazzi takes a picture of you're wife's tits and puts it on the cover of an magazine.  

As someone who hates the idea of being famous it's a truly awful idea to me. You're famous and for nothing. You have all the downsides of being famous, with very few of the upsides and you don't even have anything to be proud of. You're just a husk of a human being carted around and shown to the press and what do you have at the end of the day (in your palace that's not even yours) to give you a sliver of self worth? The barely established fact that 'your great great great great great great great ancestor was pretty good at leading others into war'. That's fucking it. That's you're entire raison d'etre - you haven't really achieved anything or helped anyone. You try to support a few charities but you're only helping indirectly by bringing 'awareness'; you didn't actually do anything you're just a parasitic host for your shitty non-job. You just exist decade after decade - kept around for the entertainment of an increasingly disdainful public. People say ""Oh, well it's good to have them around - all the history and cultural significance"" like you're a sodding zoo animal.

LOVE:
- The creature design was awesome: opening their mouths to reveal the human face was brilliant
- The small nods to pop culture (Aliens + Game of Thrones).
- Capaldi totally flipping the bird at Clara
- The inception style plot
- Where does the Doctor wake up?

HATE:
- The inception style plot (the before last dream made no sense)
- Danny Pink again... seriously?! *Thank you Moffatt for introducing a really interesting character and then really destroying any potential.
- The fact that Moffatt re-opened plots that were closed, like Clara.

First I'd like to address where the Doctor wakes up. Do you have any ideas? I mean, he sees Santa in the TARDIS when looking for Gallifrey, so does that mean that him not finding it was part of his nightmare - meaning he actually wakes up ON Gallifrey? It doesn't make sense for Santa to have visited him outside of the dream.

Also, although I didn't like old Clara, I was happy that the show had seemingly introduced an end to her character. I guess when he saw her it created a ""fixed point in time"" so he couldn't save her if he wanted to (I hate these plots where someone regrets being late... when they are a timelord!). Anyways, I was glad that it was the end of Clara and that was that... and then they woke up and jumped into the TARDIS....

I LOVE Capaldi - there's an amazing actor who hasn't even tapped into 10% of his acting abilities - he could easily be the greatest Doctor of all time - but the scripts he's working with are extremely hit or miss. Up until this point, I always loved Moffatt, but now I really do think it's time for him to retire. This should be his Last Christmas.

Not because of the particular technology though (which sounds very interesting), it won't happen because it's a technology/engineering project with an element of risk that requires vision. The UK has been utterly crap at taking the lead in any such development for over sixty years now.

It's not because we lack top flight innovators, academics and engineers. Quite the reverse is true, the problem is that our politicians and finance guys don't understand them and don't trust them. Frankly they look down on them. While our politicians always love to make speeches about the ""white heat of technology"" they don't have the first clue about it.  Almost all of them are ex lawyers and finance/business guys. Guess what they always prioritise?

Unlike Germany, China and France ... who certainly have their problems but also seem to be doing rather better than we are, especially at this sort of thing. I don't think it's a coincidence that those particular nations also have many more politicians with scientific and technical backgrounds. 

Just an example: the UK built its first nuclear reactor several years before France did. Guess who we're now paying a vast amount of public cash to build our next generation of nuclear power stations? I don't bear any ill will towards the French for this, I reserve that solely for our government.

Examples abound since 1950. Even fields we once held a lead in underinvestment and lack of vision soon turned that around. My favourite story is Churchill (admirable in many other ways) taking apart the Bletchley computers after the war. It's not like that couldn't have been a profitable industry /s.

I don't think that's a very good argument. 

First off, the linked to page is about discussing the feasibility of it so it's wrong to say we never pursued it, we're perusing it now in the mildest of manners... 

Secondly, the technology to make worthwhile small modular reactors on the cheap is relatively new. 

&gt;Or just have large nuclear plants which are much more thermally efficient, create less waste and are easier to manage? 

Speculation at best. Hinkley Point C is going to cost £24.5bn to build and produce ~3,600MW.

3600/25 = 144 small modular reactors. 

Each of the small modular reactors could cost £176m to build and we'd be quids in. There's plenty of companies putting the SMR prices at ~£12-20m. Obviously there's more to it than just the reactor, but even when you take into account government bureaucracy.. It's unlikely it'd be £176m each. 

Also, generally they're built with passive fail safes to stop any kind of meltdown from happening. They're also sealed units buried in the ground.. No chance of a successful attack on on.

I also liked the human elements to the episode. Clara is still raw about losing Danny, the Doctor is still raw about Gallifrey.

I personally didnt really like Clara at all before this season, and the reason i started to like her was quite a bit to do with Danny. However now that he's gone, I think it is an appropriate time to end that story and begin again with a new companion, rather than stringing out Clara as much as possible.

Also, If today's episode ended when Clara was old, then there would be no *massive* plot hole about what happened to the other 3 crew members. Are they dead? Because they didnt get woken up from that final layer where Clara is young again. All that it would have taken is a few shots of the Doctor going around and sonic-ing the Headcrabs on the others, but nope, moffat has left another big fat plot hole!

false,thegenregeek,null,null,"I don't know if I agree that a time lock and a pocket universe are the same thing. (Though I don't think we have enough evidence/information to confirm either way). They are, in my mind, very similar though subtly different.

I always viewed a time lock as similar to what you describe in your visualization. That Galifrey ultimately became limited/accessable to one moment in time for most time travellers. Which is to say that once the time lock went up any personal timelines of time travellers from beyond that frame of reference would be unable to travel to - or alter - any point in Galifrey's history but to the last time locked moment. If a time traveller tried to go, the time lock would block their ability to actively time travel to and alter that point and its events. (Be it [Reapers](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper) or simply the traveller being bounced back to their original point in time.) 

This is how and why the Daleks were able to launch a physical attack on the planet then and only then at the final battle we saw in TDOTD. And why the Daleks and Time Lords were fighting backwards and forwards in time up to that point (in Galifrey's personal timeline). Their goals were to alter what was occuring at that last moment in the Time Lock when Galifrey was accessable to anyone.  For the Daleks this meant altering events to allow more resources (soldiers, ships, guns) to be available to them via the future. For the Time Lords this meant changing history to reduce Dalek resources in the future (where traditional weapons could win the day). Because Galifrey was in a time lock it's personal time line was not too badly affected by changes brought during the Time War directly. To it's inhabitants the universe could change around them and it would have no impact on them personally.

The thing is that this all then lead to the creation of a fixed point in time, which is/was the final battle we saw in TDOTD (perhaps Galifrey falling into a pocket dimension caused the time lock to fail at that point, in a timey wimey paradox). Because Galifrey was only accessable (for ALL time travellers) at a single instance after a certain point Time Lords themselves lost the ability to get to Galifrey the further they went into the future of their own personal timelines. Any versions of Time Lords from during the time lock could get back to Galifrey (relative to their personal timeline) because they were suposed to and the time lock allowed it, regardless of how the universe got tangles. (So Doctors 1-8 + War Doctor passed unaffected through the time lock, interacting with points they were involved in).  Any future versions (and other races with time travel technology) could not, they could only access the final battle, where the time lock was weakest. But doing so itself became impossible because that moment became a fixed point in time as more and more alterations occured. For the Doctor (9-12) this would mean that any attempt to travel back to Galifrey would just drop him back into the final battle and risk massive paradoxes by being there. (Effectively that entire point in time became unstable and dangerous to access. Hence a fixed point in time to be avoided.)

Contrary to this being dropped into a pocket universe meant that the entire planet itself basically fell out of our universe. After that moment the time lock ended completely, when Galfrey was seemingly destroyed. At that point Galifrey truly became inaccessable through any means, because it no longer occupied any space or time in our universe. At first the Doctor (9-11) thought it meant Galifrey (and the Dalek race) was physically destroyed in that last moment is was accessable. Now he knows the planet was simply moved, but not where. Until he is able to get it back into our universe he has no viable means to get to Galifrey. Travel into pocket universes are even more dangerous and impractical than trying to access a time locked space. (For one thing we know the TARDIS is only powered by this universe and unable to function in another. The Doctor is literally the only anchor, in our universe, available to the Time Lords that will be able to pull them back. Hence their decision to reset his regeneration. Without him they are truly lost, unable to find a way back.)

Simply: Time Lock = inaccessable via time travel, for unauthorized beings. Pocket Universe = inaccessable by all means, until ""reeled"" in from being adrift in the infinite.  

To use a streamlined analogy (which avoids the time travel aspect): 

Imagine a small island in the middle of the eye of a hurricane (that never ends). Because of strong winds and waves the island is effectively cut off from outside access, except for the inhabitants having a transporter while the rest of the world has planes and boats. Anyone on the island can leave and get back as they like, their transporters avoid the natural barriers. People from outside of the island though cannot, their boats and planes are destroyed in every attempt or forced to turn around. To those outside of the storm its nearly impossible to gain access.

Now imagine the hurricane around the island just stops one day and a massive enemy fleet shows up, shelling the island but having no rounds land due to the islands defenses.  Effectively a traditional war where the islands inhabitants transporter offers little advatange, but the fleet isn't strong enough to break the perimeter.

A few hours into a feirce, stalemate battle the island is transported (via a super transporter) to an alternative reality devoid of anything but an ocean (from the islander's perspective). From the perspective of the rest of the planet the island is just gone, destroyed in the fighting. Completely inaccessible to everyone now. Unless the island suddenly appears one day it's effectively nonexistant. It went from being locked down by virtue of nature to being completely wiped out. There remains however this one guy with a transporter trying to figure out the right way to get the island back.

In this analogy the hurricane is like a time lock. The super transporter is like a pocket universe.",0,1419553461,null,0,1419586005,0,cn5dfxg,t3_2qdlw5,t1_cn5dfxg,t1_cn58ofs,null,1425216912,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

&gt;___Paprika___ (パプリカ, *Papurika* ?) is a 2006 Japanese [animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) co-written and directed by [Satoshi Kon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon), based on [Yasutaka Tsutsui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasutaka_Tsutsui)'s 1993 [novel of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(novel\)), about a research psychologist who uses a device that permits therapists to help patients by entering their dreams. It is Kon's fourth and final feature film before his death in 2010.

&gt;Kon and Seishi Minakami wrote the film's script, and [Madhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_(company\)) animated and produced the film alongside [Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_Japan), which distributed it in Japan. The film's score was composed by [Susumu Hirasawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Hirasawa).

&gt;The soundtrack is significant for being the first film to use a [Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid) and the ""Lola"" Vocaloid was used for various tracks.

I think you'll find that the driving of the obesity epidemic in the West by socioeconomic change is a well-researched and well-documented issue.  

This comes up every time we discuss obesity levels in the UK, and as an obesity researcher the myopic view of obesity as a disease of personal responsibility is frustrating to read about.  

2/3rds of the population are overweight or obese for a reason.  People haven't gotten lazier or more weak-willed over the last 50 years - as a populace we work longer hours, move less, automate more, sleep less, consume more calories and have a food and drink industry using ever-more sophisticated marketing techniques to sell us anything they can.",0,1419557622,null,0,false,0,cn5f1na,t3_2q9vpy,t1_cn5f1na,t1_cn58wxb,null,1425216164,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think a lot of people *do* blame people for being drug addicts, one only has to look at how our society demonises (and sometimes criminalises) drug users to see that many people are not as sympathetic to addiction than many subscribers to this subreddit are.

I think you are right that anger should be directed towards corporations (and perhaps the government for not taking this issue as seriously as getting people to not smoke for example). However, I think it is important to not entirely shoulder the blame on external circumstances; people are responsible for their own health. 

I have family friends who complain about not being able to lose weight and then see them eating portions that would be sufficient to feed me for more than a day. I see people lose weight for big events (weddings, holidays etc) and then take their eye off the ball months later and sink back into old routines. I don't wish to presume that my own experience with obesity is anything more than anecdotal (and I also recognise that I have an easier time keeping the weight off than many people as there are factors at play other than healthy eating and a bit of exercise) but I do feel that nothing will be solved if we only blame the external.

Jones

Kolo - Skrtel - Sakho

Henderson - Lucas - Gerrard - Markovic

Coutinho/Suso - Sterling/Lambert - Lallana

_

My main concern is how many games each player is playing, especially with the thick amount of fixtures coming up. Kolo is playing fantastic but he is old, Sakho has just come out of injury and I'm worried he'll pull something; I mean out luck hasn't been great with injuries, and Sterling I fear for another burnout. It's a good opportunity for rotation but at the same time Rodgers has just found a formation which is *working*, so don't see him changing too much.

Idea behind Suso was because the bib theory earlier in the week, seemed to be training as if he was starting and honestly I think Burnley is a good team to test some of the younger/rotation players out against. I'd even through my hat out to a youth team striker, I mean it can't hurt compared to what we have, Ojo or Sinclair, give them 10 minutes.

Frost was much better suited than I thought he'd be (I think he's great, just wasn't convinced by his casting until watching). The monster in particular was brilliant - psychologically and physically unnerving. Doctor and Clara were brilliant. Side characters weren't flat and one-dimensional (well, not all of them). The plot managed to stay one step ahead of me pretty much the whole way, particularly the whole 'long story' theme of not knowing how they got there, and not even knowing each other.

Had me confused at a couple of points but by the end I thought it was pretty coherent and made sense (unlike some of Moff's work recently...including his last couple of xmas specials). Slightly concerned that kids might not have followed it, but I'm gonna give them the credit to think that they followed the bulk of it. And they'd have enjoyed Santa and the Elves, and got a kick out of the monster.

With her own desires, life, relationships, and motives. She isn't a lapdog to the Doctor like Rose, Martha, or Amy. Coleman's acting is incredible this season as well. Overall I felt this seasons acting (with adult actors) to be a much higher caliber than previous seasons. And the character driven drama theme of Capaldis era really establishes her more than Smiths fairy tale whimsical journey of complex plot time lines.
