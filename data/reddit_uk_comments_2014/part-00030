At the very least, this means that the 'austerity' measures are a lie- all our debts cannot be paid off, so what's the point in cutting spending? All money in circulation eventually returns to government coffers anyway. Once a tenner has changed hands ten times, the treasury has reclaimed nine pounds through VAT alone. It doesn't even make any sense to cut public spending.

Ultimately, this endless pursuit to pay off debts owed to the central bank shapes the very structure of society, shifting the balance of power to a tiny elite, encouraging the cannibalisation of businesses from many small to a few large, and funneling wealth from the majority (the poor) to the minority (the rich).

Of course central banking and the fractional reserve do not stand in isolation. They are coupled with the enforcement of other concepts, such as fiat currency, private property, law enforcement, and so on.

It presents all these different facets of the miracle; how it affects different groups, who benefits, how to change the way we live, and you get to see it through the eyes of lots of different characters, not just the team.

Torchwood America isn't exactly Ianto and Tashiko, but they have interesting stories, especially within the context of the miracle.

If you do give it shot, you have to commit to at least the first 4 episodes, the story line really starts to develop and spiral from that point onward. If you only really want to watch one episode, check out episode 6 ""The Middle Men"". It's a feelsy episode, but touches on a lot of the major ""what is right and wrong now"" questions.

I've since done a complete 180 on that view, and I can summarize my reasoning with the single sentence; ""it's better to have the guy with the misconceived and maybe dangerous notions to espouse them in the open for all to ridicule, than it is for him to go underground with his ideas and bounce them around a private thought-bubble without argument.""

If you want to get a bunch of people who hate cats to go out and skin cats, the best way is to tell them they're not allowed to hate cats, and then suggest they all form a social group. This might not be a popular opinion on r/UK but one thing the US did get right was the concept of free speech.

I feel part of what made things hard for Bentaleb was City just completely crowding us out of the game in midfield.  Every time we won the ball, Bentaleb had hardly any options to pass to, and that's why he got overwhelmed so easily.

We really need to learn how to play crisp, one-touch passing triangles through our midfield when under pressure.

true,EnglishNumpty,cnty-england,England,"I don't believe that to be the case, in fact I believe the opposite to be true. Discrimination against white people is becoming increasingly acceptable. The Metropolitan Police are evening lobbying the Government to legislate to make it legal for them to discriminate against white applicants because not enough ethnic people can compete with the far better white candidates when it comes to recruiting new policemen. There's also evidence to show that white people do worse at school than all other races. There is a Foreign Office internship programme just for non-white people, with the exception of really poor white people, so a middle class black boy can join but a middle class white boy can't.

But anyway, that's not the point I was trying to make. I'm saying that people have lost their sense of proportion over so-called ""racism"". There's an irrational hysteria over ""racism"" and it is only getting worse. Part of the problem is the Racial and Religious Hatred Act that seems to criminalise a broad spectrum of essentially harmless activities like saying certain things, this has let to a chilling effect on free speech and a huge amount of self-censorship. But worse, it has created a culture of people wanting to report everything anyone says that they find offensive to the police. Someone even reported Alex Salmond to the police for calling David Cameron a ""snooty"" Englishman. If you looked at police priorities you'd think that hurting someone's feeling was a worse crime than ABH and burglary.

None of the middle three are the strongest passers of the ball, and although Paulinho in particular will move forward, I still think there's a huge gap between the lines.

My preference would be to drop Eriksen into Dembele's spot, and put Soldado up top with Adebayor playing to the left.  Eriksen will naturally drift in field and towards the front anyway, and will link well with Ade and Lamela.

Mikey became confident and strong, roses parents got back together, lots of other people made serious changes to their lives because of the doctor.

The logic behind it being a song about sexual assault is that the phrases used are frequently used in sex attacks, but they're also phrases that could be innocent. Let's assume that Robin Thicke doesn't know shit about sexual assault, never been involved with it, never had a family member experience it... isn't it possible the lyrics are just someone writing a dumb song?

It seems 100% open to interpretation, there's ways to interpret it as about sexual assault (""Obviously ""You know you want it"" is about forcing someone to have sex"") and ways to interpret it as just a lame song (""Obviously ""You know you want it"" is an arrogant person convincing someone how great they are"").

That said, your replies here are fucking bullshit and you should be ashamed. Accusing people who choose to interpret songs differently to you of being people that have no problems with committing sexual assault is really really really really lame. 

During reading about the song I came across an interesting point, and that is that the meaning of the song is totally irrelevant, whether or not it's about sexual assault or just a dumb song doesn't matter, the point is that the lyrics reinforce negative stereotypes about women. That seems like a fair angle and allows you criticise the song without calling those that like it or disagree with a specific interpretation of the lyrics potential rapists.

He is a bit of a misnomer, he looks like the archetypal target man, but does nothing that a target man should. He is a speedy forward in disguise- a very good one who would offer a lot to the right team, but that team is not us.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"It's not really the new players that concern me, and it's not a recent concern, its something going on around 8 years now. Our changing of managers, and the fact each manager is wildly different from the last is my main concern. It's like a worrying knee-jerk reaction that disrupts the entire squad.

**Martin Jol** - Man management

**Ramos** - Methodical tactics/training

**Redknapp** - Man management

**AVB** - Methodical tactics/training

**Sherwood** - Man management

There you have our last 5 managers, and their general ideas of how to manage a team. Each time it seems to be a knee-jerk reaction. 

Both **Jol** and **Redknapp** could be accused of being too friendly with the players, having favourites and being less interested in detailed tactics. 

**Ramos** and **AVB** would both be distant from players with a focus on training and tactics (and weird shit like pureé food, and blood spinning)

**Sherwood** isn't long in the job but he looks to be more man management and less tactical astuteness.

It concerns me that the people above (Levy?) don't seem to consider the fact that both AVB and Redknapp have delivered 4th place, that realistically both their general approaches can work. However switching from one to the other takes direction out of the team.

If the managers had gone Jol -&gt; Redknapp - Sherwood (Or Ramos -&gt; AVB) we could have retained some direction as they would have deployed similar players, tactics, and training. However the tweaks each made would make the difference. The team would have retained direction, and more importantly the incoming manager would not be left with some player unsuited to their ideals.

I think Sherwood will give it a good go, however if he is replaced we need someone like Sherwood only more experienced and more developed. If we flip back to an AVB style manager again at the end of the season it won't be awful due to Sherwood having a short tenure, but it sure as hell won't be helpful!

It won't be wrong if I say they accept almost anyone who has no gun on his hand. At the first years of the war they were taken to refugee camps which nears syrian border. Our goverment were bragging about how much money they spent and how well they done on televisions everyday. In my heart, I support giving a shelter who's in needs but it has changed by the time goes by. Not only many of them commited crimes in the border cities, but also we have learned that many of others used our camps like guarded place while they go back on and forth to conflict. I believe no one would like to see anything like that on there homeland. Furthermore, many of turkish houses on the border were shot many times during the conflicts which occurs nearby. I belive they need help but at the times like this they can't decide which one is good or bad so at the end it's a total chaos. For instance, as years go by, they stated to go and settle on different cities of Turkey, even the ones which miles and miles away from border like Istanbul. I'm residing in Istanbul for many years and even I came across two little children who's trying to have the cashier of the grocery on the corner of my house write some turkish words for begging.

I think, like many others, our best chance of doing this is improving the ""spine"" of our team. Which means signing a DM who can at the very least be a capable understudy to Lucas.

After that I think any signing we get is a bonus towards qualifying for CL.

Does this guy, alone, help us get to CL? I just don't think so. Right now we've got Sterling, Suarez, Sturridge, and Coutinho all competing for what would usually be 3 spots - although, in the absence of Lucas, Rodgers has used all 4.

Would we benefit from having a spark on the bench? Meaning anyone of these guys coming on in the 60th, versus how we operate now with only Aspas/Alberto in attacking roles? Sure. 

But I'd rather solidify our mid and back this year and then, if/when we qualify for CL, use our new status to sign another TOP forward/attacker. Which I think we'd be capable of.

Bring in a replacement for one of them and let Flanagan be the other starting fullback on the opposite side. Flanagan has really impressed in just about every match he's ever played for us, even going back to 2011. I truly think he'll be a legendary Liverpool fullback in a few years time.

true,ConRadRooz,mcgann,McGann,"Well I can tell you why I like her personally, although if I'm being honest I can see why you would feel that way.  I sort of was thinking the same thing when she was talking to Micky and her mom about how much life was gonna suck now that she was stuck in her own time, but I feel like that was kinda understandable since she kinda had that whole situation sprung on her and the Doctor asked her to pretend like all that stuff never happened while he was out there dying.  I think Donna might have actually reacted in a very similar way if she had any idea that she was missing out on something.  So in the end I believe she really did save them because she cared.  But annnyyyways why I like her.  Yeah she had her annoying moments, but I can get over that knowing that's because she has a bit of an attitude to her that is sometimes actually pretty cool instead of annoying, really depends on the scenario. She never got intimidated by the Doctor dispute him being, ya know, the Doctor.  She was never afraid to give him a piece of her mind if he babying her or toeing any moral lines.  Yet she and the Doctor always had a blast together, played off his quirky nature well, always a good sign.  She learned really fast (deduced what time period in the future they were in based on the architecture that one time) and could handle being off by herself and working at the problems they faced while the Doctor did his part elsewhere.  And, probably my favorite part about her, is that while she was clever, she had a knack for stumbling upon the root of whatever issue she and the Doctor were facing.  She would notice the tiniest things, follow up on them, and boom she would run into the aliens or Jack or whatever else they needed to do the job.  So much so that she would often stumble upon the issue faster than the Doctor, king of stumbling upon issues, which is why I think they make a good match.  Other companions never really did that.

true,puckyou,flair7,,"&gt; both AVB and Redknapp have delivered 4th place

Actually Spurs got fourth twice under Harry and only came in fifth in AVB's one full season.

Overall though I agree with your sentiment that Spurs change managers a bit too much. This like you said leads to the trend that there tends to be a general shift in the tactics between managers which creates a lot of discontinuity and stifles the teams growth a bit.

I wasn't really a fan of AVB being sacked. Although the results weren't really that great and the team's play was even worse I still would've liked to have seen him finish out the season at least. Even though the team struggled a fair amount of the time they did show some flashes at times, like the first half the Chelsea game. The team would've probably benefited from more consistency in terms of the first eleven considering there were a lot of new players that came into the team over the last transfer window. I also feel that even Spurs worst results, losing to Man City 6-0 and Liverpool 0-5, were quite as horrendous as some made them out to be when compared to what other teams have done in similar fixtures. Everton who are also in the running for fourth just lost 4-0 to Liverpool with an injury ravaged defense like Spurs had at the time of their loss to Liverpool but you don't hear anyone saying they want Martinez out.

As for Sherwood I think he has benefited a bit from a rather easy run of fixtures minus the Man City game.

By then, our wage bill will increase and our expectations can rise, but until then, a young manager with a young squad, who were actually performing well, should have been given time. AVB was stubborn and made some mistakes, but we should have pushed through it for the sake of consistency.

Now we have an interim first time manager forcing out players in favor of promoting his youth academy players and the overall vision of the club starts to slip. I don't think that we're in crisis mode and we don't necessarily need Champions League this season (although I still think we'll get 4th), but Levy, Baldini and AVB really had something going there. I just hope we get through tomorrow without permanently letting go of anyone and make it to the summer on a good note so Van Gaal can come take over.

I still feel the same way.

There are two very obvious scenarios that will happen this transfer window: We either get someone. Or we we don't. And those two scenarios - in relation to a Champions League spot - will, in my opinion, lead to these scenarios:

* We *don't* get a player this January window; We get a Champions League spot: Supporters will praise FSG, Rodgers, etc. for their faith in the current squad and their refusal to pay over the odds.
* We *do* get a player and that player makes a positive impact; We get a CL spot: Supporters will praise FSG, Rodgers, etc. for making a positive addition to the squad.
* We *don't* get a player this January window; We *don't* get a CL spot: Supporters are outraged at the club for missing the chance to add a potentially valuable piece to the squad.
* We *do* get a player and that player makes an impact; We *don't* get a CL spot: Perhaps the argument is made that the wrong player was purchased but one could - begrudgingly - argue that the club at least tried.

Obviously, if we get a CL spot, there should be no complaints no matter what happens in this January window.

However, you can see that if we miss out on a CL spot and we *didn't do anything* this window... there'll be a LOT of outrage and finger pointing and a very tumultuous summer.

At the *very least* - even if it's only for a public relations stand point - the club **must** add to the squad this window. There's too much wild speculation for me to even start discussing potential players or positions that need strengthening; there's plenty of discussion on that already. But I'll repeat the quote from David Usher: *'Things are so tight for that fourth Champions League spot that missing out because of a lack of squad depth would be unforgivable.'*

The lad has promise, yes. He could be a very solid player. But I honestly think from what I've seen that Sterling is a more complete player right now. It doesn't mean Kono doesn't have value because I think Sterling could fetch quite a sum at this point. I just think it means we have bigger needs.

I agree about needing depth up front but I just feel it needs to be said our recruitment team/Rodgers are absolutely failing to address what has so often been our undoing. Which is poor midfield play. While next season I'd be fine to see Gerrard worked into that deep role, to continue with that experiment this year could be disastrous. In order for him to be comfortable in that role he needs to be with two athletic players. We already have Hendo but there's no one else like that.

I realize there aren't many proven DMs and its a surprisingly tough position to get a money for value, but Kono just seems like an attacking buy for the sake of it. 

Honestly, right now Rodgers has on his record Borini and Aspas, who should have been able to contribute from or close to the off. That neither has is an indictment - a bit - on his judgment.

We can't forget he apparently didn't want Sturridge and thought Dempsey was worth getting. 

All in all, as a new manager his judgment ends up being much like a normal fan. He wants whatever he can get as quickly as he can. When he's been allowed to just go for it, we have had some issues. Right now you could hardly say his judgment has been more than 50/50. And frankly, Kono, much like Willian, wreaks to me of someone who wants a signing/a boost just for the sake of it. Again, as I said, we do need actual talented attacking depth. But we should have some already and yet none of them have come good. Kono looks to much like a possibility of that all over.


Right now, in my mind, Rodgers is getting off a bit easy because Sturridge and Coutinho were such successes from the beginning. After them our transfers have been unfulfilled or basically failures.

Not sure if that's unpopular or not. Personally, I completely agree with you. Sakho is 23 and was bought for a reason...to be the heart of our defence for the next decade. Skrtel and Agger have been good servants to the club, but they're by no means title challenging calibre. Just think of all the mistakes they've made over the years...Skrtel especially. I spend an inordinate amount of time just waiting for another defensive cock-up, no matter how many months have passed since their last one.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"I've watched him a fair bit and he is not just some unknown overpriced player. He has performed at the highest level internationally as well putting in Motm performances against top opposition. If you watch him play he is clearly a much better player than all of those around him. He is very much like Sterling but he has a much better shot / eye for goal and i'd rate him as a better overall player than Sterling is currently because of that. The only thing I worry about with this signing is Konos ability to adapt to the UK but that is always going to be a risk when you sign foreign players.

I don't think Willian is a good example to use because he has been an amazing signing for Chelsea and is exactly the type of player we needed as well. There are plenty of other players that have also come out of the Ukranian league and slotted into teams at the highest level. 

I think the only real ""failed"" transfer above 10m has been Borini, though he had a horrible time with injuries his first year. Borini was signed because he was a player he knew from his time at Swansea and Chelsea, and seeing as we didn't have a transfer comittee set up yet he went for players he knew well in Allen and Borini (which we overpaid for). Players below 10m I consider non risk. The expectations of the player are much lower and if they end up being a top player then you have done well. If not, you can re-sell them for a decent return. Players like Aspas / Moses are brought in to add depth for an already thin squad and compete for first team places. It is very very difficult to add first team players for under 15m and we got extremely lucky with the Sturridge and Coutinho signings. In an ideal world we can pull those off every window but its just not feasible.

Many people thought Dempsey was worth getting, and we had a valuation of 4-5m so it was low risk even though he was a one season wonder (ppl complained when we didnt meet Fulhams valuation and it turned out to be for good reason). I dont believe for one second that BR did not want Sturridge or that we would sign players that he does not want.

At the end of the day, transfers are always going to be a risk. You could end up with a Milan Shevchenko or a Chelsea Shevchenko. But either way, all top teams need depth and that is something we are extremely lacking so it is worth the risk in our push for the top 4.

No, it really isn't. 

*You want* things. Other people make the things *you* want using their labour (and capital). You exchange the things you make for the things you want. Money helps to facilitate that exchange.

Yes unfortunately, this system is flawed in that it significantly favours people who learn to manipulate money and manipulate others using money.

&gt;Purchasing is not useful,

So you don't buy anything then? And if you do, it's as a result of political domination, not because you actually need something you don't have?

&gt;Value is arbitrary, money cannot be used to store it.

Money isn't a perfect store of value due to inflation, but it's a significant improvement over many of the alternatives bread, fish, wheat etc. Precious metals are a good store of value, but they're just another form of money.

&gt;Much has been said about this interrogation in the media. A lot of it is wrong. It is often reported to have been very long, with some stories claiming it lasted either 13 or 18 hours. These are simply untrue. The interrogation did not exceed 2¼ hours. There is also the claim that Amanda was interrogated without an interpreter. Again this is completely untrue. Knox had an interpreter named Anna Donnino, and this is well known since she testified at the trial. There have also been claims that Amanda was denied food and water during her interrogation. The truth is that she was offered tea, and since the interrogation took place from about 11 pm to 1:45 am, and Knox had arrived straight after eating a meal, it is unclear why food was needed. Lastly, Knox claims that she was abused and hit. Knox was unable to even vaguely identify who allegedly hit her. All others present deny that there was any mistreatment. There are claims that Knox was intimidated by a large group of police officers who participated in the interrogation. According to Amanda's own words these are also untrue, as only one female officer, and the interpreter, were present. All of these lies were told by the Knox family, and spread by the public relations firm hired by them to change public sentiment. They needed to misrepresent how the confession was obtained, to make their claim, that it was a false confession believable.

This completely ignores the UK sale of goods act that states that an item has to be fit for purpose and last a reasonable time. 

They go on to advise me to contact the manufacturer. Again, ignoring the fact that under the sale of goods act, my claim is against the seller, not the manufacturer.

I think a lot of what causes someone to be pulled over by the police, even if it appears to be routine, is the way in which you drive.  If you're getting pulled over 5 times in 4 years, you're doing something to attract their attention.

A first step would be for instance to start Capoue instead of Bentaleb for the Hull game, as Capoue was significantly better and the goal surely must have upped his confidence. 
This should be our starting line-up drawing from form and merit according to me:

                                   Lloris

       Walker         Dawson      Chiriches     Naughton (no other choice)

                                Adebayor

I personally would sub in Paulinho, Sandro or Vertoghen just to give them game time ONLY in a no risk situation.

What I expect Sherwood to do :

                                 Lloris

    Walker         Dawson      Chiriches     Vertonghen

       Lennon                Eriksen               Sigurdsson

I had heard about this case a few times, read about it in a few articles, seen a few TV reports, and so had formed some sort of rough idea of it in my mind, and yet when I came on reddit the other day and read a thread of Americans talking about it, it was like a different world.

I think we got that, as many proposals put forth by the conservatives have been tempered by them.

As for the tuition fees side of things, I actually think it was a fine stance for them to take considering they were wanting to ensure noone was unable to go to university from the UK who wanted to. As the maximum a university could charge was raised (over £6000), universities had to enact more grants for poorer students. Not only this, but they ensured the loan that covered this had better terms than previously.. it is similar to a 5% tax on the money earned over £22k for people going to university, with a cap based on £9000 x Number of Years in University. This helps people on lower incomes both before and after university, whilst slightly raises taxes for people earning over £22k after university for a short amount of time. Personally, raising income taxes on richer people who can afford it (even if those people are likely to be me in the future) is why I voted for them, as both Labour and the Conservatives seemed unwilling to do this openly. [edit: as an aside, as we are in the EU and have to treat EU students to the same fees as UK students, perhaps this ""high fees with good terms loans for UK students"" is a way of getting around those rules... I'm not sure about this, perhaps someone else has a better idea of the legalities?]

Overally, I felt that the Lib Dems had much poorer influence in newspapers and TV news, and so have had a lot of blame poured on them by both Labour and the Conservatives as they don't want a repeat of what happened in the last election (Labour especially, as it appeared that the Lib Dem vote takes from traditional Labour voters), and it was mostly undeserved.

&gt;Average UK living standards have fallen ""dramatically"" since the recession and will not reach pre-crisis levels by the next election, economists have said.

&gt;The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculated that a mid-range household's income between 2013 and 2014 was 6% below its pre-crisis peak.

&gt;This was felt equally across high and low income groups when the cost of living was taken into account.

&gt;But those on low incomes could feel the squeeze more in the coming years.

&gt;It has produced figures showing all except the richest 10% saw their take-home wages rise by at least 2.5% once tax cuts were taken into account.

&gt;That is more than the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate of 2.4% in the year to April 2013.

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"I voted Lib Dem at the last election, being sold on their commitment to university fees, progressive taxation and on individual liberties. It was obvious that they were the 3rd party and would have to join a coalition, but I figured the more natural fit would probably be Labour, even with the Lib Dems inclination towards business rather than unions.

Being nearly 10 years out of university, the fees element didn't affect me directly, and I can understand the reasoning behind increasing the fees so that all of the costs fall upon the student eventually rather than their family upfront. However, I'm a firm believer in further education, and think our taxes should go to funding that more than they currently do, for the long-term good of the country and economy. It was therefore disappointing that the Lib Dems chose to sacrifice this manifesto commitment as part of the coalition.

I'm a realist, however, and know that they weren't in a position to enact everything from their manifesto. I agree with other posters that it's scary to think how much the Conservatives could've forced through without the Lib Dems tempering their actions somewhat. Unfortunately, we probably won't know many of the backroom deals until well after the next election.

The major disappointment for me was the failure to reform elections and the House of Lords. Whilst AV wasn't perfect, it was much, much better than our current system and was one step down the road towards PR. The way in which the Lib Dems were bent over by the Tories on this has left me very suspicious of them showing any backbone on other policies in the future, whether it be with Labour or Conservatives.

I'm not committing myself to any one party for the next election just yet, but it's likely that I will still vote for the Lib Dems. I genuinely believe that coalitions are better for the country than one-party governments, and the Lib Dems are currently the best chance to get one. It'd be very interesting to see how a Lib Dem/Labour coalition plays out, particularly with a business-friendly chancellor like Ed Balls who seems like he would be a good fit with Lib Dems.",0,1391163520,null,0,false,0,cf3hy0a,t3_1wmskk,t1_cf3hy0a,t3_1wmskk,null,1432189010,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Glory Years covers the late sixties and early to mid seventies when we were one of, if not THE best team in the world. Read up on Don Revie, Billy Bremner, Peter Lorimer, Allan Clarke etc..

We won the league in the '91-'92 season, beating our bitter rivals Manchester United ('scum', never call them anything but 'scum') in to second place. Key players were Gordon Strachan, Lee Chapman, Gary McAllister, David Batty and the late Gary Speed.

We also had a revival of sorts in the late nineties and very early 2000s under Peter Risdale's ownership. Part one of our Champions League campaign here - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91z5wToZ1UQ - again there's links to the other parts on the right hand side. That all went to shit and we're now a club that I can't believe you'd want to follow. 

We do have one thing we can still be proud of though - we have the best fans in the world. That is fact. Get yourself to an away game and you'll see for yourself. 

Oh and learn the words to Marching On Together - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuMyUh26twQ - you're not a Leeds fan until you know them like they're the first words you ever uttered.

true,lewdawg,null,null,"I understand the arguments here about a white-only version of this meetup being socially unacceptable, but I feel like this comment is the only one that acknowledges that a black professionals meetup is not just a purposeless meeting of a minority group based on the color of their skin.

&gt; if this was a group for something more specific which implicitly meant black people were the only members, that is on the whole different, i.e. Nigerians Professional Group

For black *professionals*, that ""something more specific"" is the subtle difficulties that black people face, sometimes daily, within the workplace and in day-to-day life. 

An example would be a work-mate casually stating ""you speak really well"" or ""..really clearly"" - not a racist comment and usually meant purely as a compliment, but as a black person born and raised in England it's a comment that can be laced with implications and potential hidden meanings about you and your race. I would much rather share this subtle experience with a group of people who understand or have been in similar situations, and can help me work through it an a logical and positive way, then snap at the co-worker with a negative, defensive responsive that will lead to further issues (and definitely not the opportunities for ""equality to flourish"" talked about elsewhere).

Find a common issue amongst white professionals that isn't often talked about and set up a white professionals meetup to help resolve that issue or even just to share dinner and chat about everyday life outside of those issues. Invite me, a black man, to this meetup and I'll happily attend (I'll positively promote the event for you, in fact).

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"Of course I feel put off by it, but I think the country is better off with a coalition lasting five years than the alternative, which was a minority Conservative government with support from the Lib Dems on a policy by policy basis. That wouldn't have inspired much confidence in the United Kingdom, particularly its economy, and we wouldn't be seeing the beginnings of a recovery today.

I don't understand the hate that Nick Clegg personally gets. The coalition was put to a vote by the party, who supported going with the Conservatives. People say he sold the country out for power? I don't understand that, it suggests that people would only ever vote Lib Dem on the condition they never get in power. These are simply protest voters that any party coming into maturity needs to shake off. UKIP and the Green party get the protest vote now, and will be abandoned by them at their time too.

Tuition fees is often brought up. They have apologized for making that promise - it was a stupid promise to make really. But a general election is just as much about deciding who is going to keep what promises, as it is about deciding whose policies you like the best. And here it was most likely that they enter a coalition with either party - probably the Tory party - and this was the accepted predicted outcome for a while before the election itself. Both parties were going to raise them, and there were other Lib Dem policies that were going to have a higher priority (their biggest one was raising the personal allowance - a promise they kept despite Tory opposition, in fact now the Tories peddle it as if it was *their* policy!). If you really thought that the Lib Dems would fervently resist an increase in tuition fees in a coalition,  and voted for them on that basis, frankly that is your own fault.

It's disappointing that they haven't managed to get through as much as they wanted. Considering they were the most left-wing option in 2010 and they are in coalition with what was the most right-wing option, it's understandable that they don't get as much done, particularly when it's over 300 seats vs under 60.

Clearly a coalition with Labour would have been preferred by Lib Dem voters, MPs and party members. But they didn't have that option.

What is more likely to put me off voting for me is the whole Chris Rennard thing and how that's been handled (disgracefully).

**TL;DR** The fact they took a bullet for the country by going into a coalition in which everybody wins politically except them (well you can see the result)? No, that wins them my respect.

**A quick history** 

* Formed in 1919 after Leeds City FC were dissolved after making illegal payments to footballers during WWI.
* Most successful period was in the late 60s/early 70s, winning the league twice in that period, runners up 5 times, won the FA Cup, League Cup and should have won what is now the Champions League but lost out due to a dodgy linesman (1975).
* Then-manager and club legend Don Revie changed the Leeds colours from yellow and blue to all-white to emulate Real Madrid (20-odd-times Spanish champions at the time).
* Also won the league the year before it became the Premiership (1991/92), the season after getting promoted
* More recently, made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League but spent a **lot** of money in the process, had to sell sell sell as a result, got relegated (twice) and went into administration (twice). 
* Started 2007/8 at the bottom of League One (third tier) with -15 points due to aforementioned admin, ended this season and the following losing in the playoffs before winning promotion as runners-up.
* Currently nicely established in the Championship (second tier) for the third season in a row, under Brian McDermott who won promotion with Reading two seasons ago .

**Some bits to get you up to speed**

Current notable players:

* Ross McCormack, captain. Scottish international and current top scorer - his best goalscoring season was two years ago (19 goals) but is already on 16 this season. Creative, tricky and scores all kinds of goals - instinctive tap-ins, curls from the edge of the box, free kicks. Notches a fair few assists too and while he does have barren patches, they mostly come when he's not playing up front.

* Rodolph Austin. Tough tackling and strong centre midfielder who can also power forward and set up a few goals. Passing can be either awful or immense depending on his day but has become 'the Beast' down to his combative play style. Will shoot from like 30 yards out with a shot that will take your head off at least once a game (and probably not score from it).

* Sam Byram, young English right back who was thrown into the first team (about the only thing previous manager Neil Warnock got right). Currently the highlight of the current crop of Leeds youngsters, quiet and gets on with it but one of the most creative players we've had in years and most people will tell you he should be playing on the right wing (I disagree). Such a talent that at one stage last season, El-Hadji Diouf said he would only look for Byram when passing, as he was the only player Diouf thought could do anything with the ball.

Recent names you'll probably hear a lot of:

* Robert Snodgrass, Jonny Howson, Bradley Johnson, Luciano Becchio: three talented lads who were with us since League One, plus Bradley Johnson. All left for Norwich over the last couple of years, so it's become a (now tiresome) running joke that any talented youngster we come out with will end up being sold to Norwich. Becchio was exchanged for Steve Morison in what I deem as the Most Pointless Transfer Of All Time^^TM - Becchio can't get a game at Norwich (he entered the top 10 Leeds goalscorers of all time not long before he left) and Morison was loaned back to his old club Millwall after a few months.

* Max Gradel - top, top (top) Ivorian winger who was sold to St Etienne two years ago. Very quick, very tricky and banged in 18 goals in our first season back in the Championship (Becchio got 20). Was sent off after about half an hour during the promotion-winning game in 2010 but we won so he was forgiven. Like Becchio, will probably be linked to a move back to Leeds during the upcoming transfer window but that probably won't happen.

* Alex Mowatt, Chris Dawson, Dominic Poleon - three of the club's most recent academy graduates, all in and around the first team at different stages of the past year or so. Mowatt's a creative central midfielder who has started the last 10 or so games and has established himself in the starting lineup. Dawson made a couple of appearances toward the end of last season, while Poleon has been in and out of the lineup since the start of last season, starting the odd game and scoring the odd goal, now a regular fixture on the subs bench.

* Salah Nooruddin, Salem Patel, David Haigh - all part of GFH Capital who own the club, with Haigh as the club's Managing Director. This week Haigh failed with a takeover bid to buy the club off GFHC. Haigh's stock has fallen drastically with a lot of he fans - whilst he has done a lot of good work off the pitch (and personally, I don't think this should be forgotten) a lot of his persona is forged by PR. Two seperate parties, [one ran by Massimo Cellino and the other by Mike Farnan](http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/farnan-and-cellino-in-battle-for-leeds-united-1-6408612) are now believed to be in the running to buy the club.

And as suggested:

* Historic rivals - the likes of Man United and Chelsea will always be put into this category. Reasons why could go beyond the text limit of this post, but Man United (*never* just 'United') are the big ones, and both have their own Wikipedia articles ([Man Utd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry), [Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.%E2%80%93Leeds_United_A.F.C._rivalry)). [This is up there with the highlights of our recent history, we were in League One at the time (and won btw)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpnrxCXZJ4), and we also [beat Chelsea 1-0 in a match that lasted 45 minutes last season.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20690782). 

* Geographic rivals - most of these have developed over the last 10 years or so in our period outside the top flight, but recently, matches v Huddersfield, Middlesborough and (not-so-geographically) Millwall have taken on a larger significance (to the away fans at least). The Millwall one probably stems from a) two very, very passionate sets of fans and b) Millwall beating us in the League One playoffs a few years ago.

Sorry, on mobile.

Basically, as long as they have absolutely no accountability or responsibilities, the Greens are okay, but once they try to do what they said they want to do, they fall prey to the same problems other parties have.

Claiming the moral high ground is easy when you are not accountable for what you say, which is why the Greens and Lib Dems were so popular when they were in opposition. When they face the reality, then they start mimicking the traits they got political capital from denouncing before.

In summary, enormous doses of Delta 9 THC, All THC and concentrated marihuana extract ingested by mouth were unable to produce death or organ pathology in large mammals but did produce fatalities in smaller rodents due to profound central nervous system depression.

The non-fatal consumption of 3000 mg/kg A THC by the dog and monkey would be comparable to a 154-pound human eating approximately 46 pounds (21 kilograms) of 1%-marihuana or 10 pounds of 5% hashish at one time. In addition, 92 mg/kg THC intravenously produced no fatalities in monkeys. These doses would be comparable to a 154-pound human smoking at one time almost three pounds (1.28 kg) of 1%-marihuana or 250,000 times the usual smoked dose and over a million times the minimal effective dose assuming 50% destruction of the THC by smoking.

Thus, evidence from animal studies and human case reports appears to indicate that the ratio of lethal dose to effective dose is quite large. This ratio is much more favorable than that of many other common psychoactive agents including alcohol and barbiturates (Phillips et al. 1971, Brill et al. 1970).

true,eldenv,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; The problem is that among the things the Lib Dems u-turned on there were some biggies (tuition fees being the most prominent) that they basically staked their entire reputation on.

I think this is the key point. I think most LibDem voters are realists and understand that being part of a coalition government would mean that it would not be able to enact all it's policies.

But saying no to a rise in tuition fees was one of the most important parts of their campaign in 2010, and certainly won them a lot of support amonst students. Every single Lib Dem MP that was elected signed a pledge saying ""I pledge to vote against any increase in fees in the next parliament and to pressure the government to introduce a fairer alternative"", [including Nick Clegg](http://www.beatmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Nick-Clegg-tuition-fees-pledge500x700.jpg), and the way they did it was highly publicised.

7 months after the election, 27 LibDem MPs voted for the rise in tuition fees, and 8 abstained, with 21 opposing. That makes 35 out of 56 who didn't follow through with the pledge they signed.

I think a lot of people can forgive the Liberal Democrats for not being able to do everything they wanted to do, as the smaller partner in the coalition. But they quickly went against what was their biggest and most public campaign promise. It makes their [2010 party political broadcast painfully funny viewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLR8R9JXz4).

But now if his form doesn't improve until the end of the season, I would probably want to get rid of him. In all honesty, I think Brad Jones would have probably performed better for those 4 games against City/Chelsea/etc and wouldn't have directly cost us goals and points.

I don't know exactly what the problem with Simon is but it's obviously related to the pressure of playing for a big club and the expectation to constantly perform day in and day out.

The timing chains can go loose and rattle. They can also leak oil from various places, the sump is one place, and the dipstick seal is another.

Makes sure you get both keys, and they both work, they can become unsynced and you'll spend £100 or so getting them resynced. 

Check in the footwells and behind the seats for water, if it's in the footwell it's likely to be the windscreen wiper tray seal, if its behind the seats it's likely to be the roof seals.

Check the roof goes backwards and forwards OK a few times, they can jam sometimes. 

Check the boot opens OK from the key. 

They also leak around the wing mirrors, so you'll see water pouring in over your speaker grilles.

My reasoning is the following: we all agree Lucas is an important part of the team and the stats seem to support this. In fact, one could argue we are relying on Lucas. That wouldn't be a problem if he was fairly consistent in terms of his availability. 

The thing is, whenever he is injured, we seem to be a bit like a headless chicken. As he is injured far too often, our season and form seem to get derailed every couple of months.

Yes. Volvo brought out some mirrors on trucks in the early 2000's which put a wide angle mirror at the bottom of the main one on the drivers side. The downside of that was that it created a hell of a blindspot and if you approached a large roundabout at just the right speed, such as the one at the end of a motorway exit sliproad, a car already on the roundabout coming from the right could be completely hidden behind the mirror and the first you'd know about it being there was when you pulled out and found a car suddenly in front of you. 

And then you've got the fact that it takes a certain amount of time for the driver to look at the mirror, their eyes focus on them and then to process what they see, all whilst trying to pilot up to 44 tonnes down the road.

I definitely agree with you about Mignolet's feet, he has horrible distribution and that's what he needs to focus on, every time someone passes it back to him, I freak out a little. That is basically how Southampton beat us, they marked the defender (off a goal kick and when the ball was in our final third) so that Mignolet had to play it long instead of playing it out of the back like he was taught, and we kept losing it because of Mignolet's distribution.

What's the point of saving lives if those lives are so boring because there's no risk? Should we all just sit in padded rooms and never leave the house just to remove risk and save lives? You have to draw a line somewhere, and if you can't even show that there's any risk there then you are wayyyyy behind that line.

&gt; You don't believe there is a risk but the risk is there. You can't change facts. There is a fact that more weapons will be on streets.

Really? Where's your evidence to say that guns will magically disappear from locked cabinets on ranges and in people's homes and suddenly reappear on the streets? They don't now, we have hundreds of thousands of rifles, shotguns and certain types of handguns that *don't* end up on the streets. The guns that criminals use are more often smuggled in from eastern Europe, or modified from deactivated guns or blank firing guns.

&gt; In no way you can guarantee in 100% that those weapons won't be used for the purpose not intended. Simple statistics will tell you the truth.

And the statistics tell me that it's almost unheard of.

&gt; It obviously would be good to have no cars as this would save lives but here statistics take into account the fact the society won't really exist without cars this days.

Might not exist as it is now but it could still exist in some form, given that cars are a relatively new thing. People just don't want to give up the luxury. Well I don't want to have to give up my sport. I just happen to be in the minority, and as I said before, the law shouldn't be ""mob rule"".

&gt; Guns don't bring ANYTHING positive

...in your opinion.

&gt; In any case, even look at cars. How much improvement has been put into them. Isn't this a ""reducing risk"" which you oppose off?

I'm not opposed to reducing risk in all cases, I'm opposed to reducing quality of life in the name of reducing risk when that risk is either very small or non-existent. As I said, existing laws on the acquisition and storage of firearms are what reduce the risk (and have only a limited impact on the sport), not restrictions on type of gun, which barely reduces risk at all, but cripples the sport.

Watching other sides play, especially when the ball is in the opponents half, they are zipping around passes and not giving the opponent time to really settle into a defensive shape. From a lot of times when Ive watched us this year I get the feeling that we are lacking that tempo in our passing. It feels like players, many times, constantly take that extra touch to receive and control a pass, and then when they turn and look up the options aren't as present. I wish we had a higher tempo at times--doesn't mean it's as direct but I would love to see us ping around the ball more. 

This isn't controversial per se but I think getting Sahko was an incredible coup by LFC. We got him right from under PSG's nose and the guy has already shown lots of potential as well as current abilities. He's set to be a starter for France for the foreseeable future and I think hopefully a constant in our backline too. 

We need better quality fullbacks especially if Brendan wants us to play with wide players who cut in. Width is essential to spreading play.

Without a PGCE you can't be accepted as a teacher, and as per the name you need an accredited Bachelor's degree in your teaching subject (or equivalent).

Plus as has been said already you need to look at the other end of the scale to where you were reading before. And don't interpret living in London as getting a higher wage - things here cost more so it's supposed to work out the same but often it's a lower salary than elsewhere in the country.

And, as people have said below, public sector workers in the UK are currently experiencing deteriorating conditions and pay, and teachers are affected by this too. 

You will have to deal with unruly kids, and kids who tend not to enjoy languages as much as other subjects because they think they aren't relevant. Class sizes in the UK tend to be around 30 pupils to a teacher although this can vary.

If you join a secondary school here in the UK (years 7-11 which equates to ages 11-16) you will likely be teaching students French in mandatory lessons one hour long a week in years 7-9, and as an optional GCSE unit in years 10-11. This will probably be a full-time position unless you can work something out with the school.

The bottom line is that language classes in the UK are being seen as less and less relevant by pupils (probably because languages are difficult!).

Nothing beats the feeling of spotting a lost kid and helping the police reunite them with their parents. We never get any thanks from the parents (or police usually) but the look on the parents face is great to watch when they see their kid again.

As for qualifications, you need a SIA badge, which is standard for all security personal. I also took a BTEC in public area surveillance. The rest is on the job training.

true,psandd,null,null,"&gt;You obviously aren't going to university in the future or you wouldn't be in favour of it, but let's pretend you were. Would you honestly prefer this system to the previous one?

Okay let's do an approximate breakdown of the costs:


* Previous system: ~£3000 per year in tuition fees. 3 years average  degree in England (in Scotland you got your 4th year 'free' if you were from England as it was assumed you could do the same degree in 3 years and they didn't want to put you off.. bit odd but there you go). So £9000 overall. It was about 15% over £15,000 you had to pay back. So if you earned £30,000 on  average for the next 4 years you'd pay it all back, but you'd be paying £2,250 each year for this. If you earned £20,000 on average for the next 12 years, you'd pay (an average of) £750 back per year and you'd have paid it off.


* New system: Let's assume the maximum of about 9000 per year with a 3 year degree (27000). At 5% over 22,000, with an average pay of 30,000 you'd pay back £400 a month and it'd take 67.5 years to actually pay it off. HOWEVER, student loans are written off 25 years after it's taken out in the new scheme (35 in Scotland due to the law there) [see here](http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678571&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL) so you'd only pay around 10,000 (this is something that isn't often made clear). If you averaged 20,000 (which is on the low side for a graduate in general, but possible in a lower demand position) you wouldn't pay anything back.

So yes, I might prefer it personally and gamble on not earning megabucks from my degree. But I definitely prefer it socially as it reduces the strain on the people earning less whilst charging a limited amount more to high earners that went to university.",0,1391168114,null,0,false,0,cf3imq8,t3_1wmskk,t1_cf3imq8,t1_cf3iadd,null,1432189362,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Beyond that, the unique selling point of both the Orange Book and Social Democrat factions of the Lib Dems is civil liberties. They have compromised too much in this area.

Right now the season isn't over so i cant account for dropped points but I think he's saved face by suarez and sturridge keeping us afloat with goals the other end

------------------------------

At the start of the season he was OUTSTANDING and we loved this because we needed a change.

But as the season has progressed and after most people slated Reina for all his personal mistakes (that i still attribute a lot of blame to our CB's.. which is now way more apparent) recently there have been a fair few goals we've conceded that I felt Mignolet more than should have been able to handle or he makes a mistake and has fucked up, mainly his positioning is what costs us the most

**Examples:**

last night was prime example, the [first goal](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_-cFU1RGdhc/UtrAHqf_pmI/AAAAAAAABXI/B5C9sRwrsSo/s0/18-01-2014-GifNumber-80.gif) look at how far off his line he is, sure i understand he's covering his post but look how far he's strayed despite the number of players in defence we have. 

* There are 2 Villa players in the box
* There are 6 Liverpool players in the box
* 3 defenders including Mignolet are covering the villa players with the ball
* with a 5th making a challenge
* Gerrard who is meant to be playing DM is day dreaming and completely misses Weimann
* Ball slips past them all somehow and Migs is too far off his line to get his body in the way.

and the [second goal](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ViOm6yd4R0g/UtrDIDBKetI/AAAAAAAABXU/GmFbsrQQrMY/s0/18-01-2014-GifNumber-81.gif) he makes this unnecessary one handed hero dive (the same thing he tried against city) knocking the ball over Johnsons head to beneke

* There are 2 liverpool players marking him, but nobody is on him
* despite this he comes off his line to make a save with one hand (no intention of catching it) 

Both times, the ONE player meant to be covering and protecting the goal line is not there, so while the defence makes its fair share of mistakes Mignolet needs to be held accountable too.

If people had read the Lib Dem manifesto properly, they'd have found that what they were proposing instead of tuition fees was a ""graduate tax"", but in reality that's a largely illusory distinction. A graduate tax provides that:  

- Nobody will pay anything up-front.  
- Nobody will pay anything until their earnings exceed a certain threshold.  
- Graduates will pay a percentage of any earnings above that threshold.  

The system that we actually have - which is referred to as ""tuition fees"" - provides that:  

- Nobody will pay anything up-front.  
- Nobody will pay anything until their earnings exceed a certain threshold.  
- Graduates will pay a percentage of any earnings above that threshold.  
- Once a certain amount has been paid off or a certain length of time has passed, the graduate's obligations will cease.  

To all intents and purposes, it's a graduate tax with a cap - or you could equally say that the graduate tax would have amounted to fees with no cap - and yet for whatever reason people have it in their minds that there's a categorical distinction between the two.

Maybe his confidence is low? Time will tell.

His kicking is a cause for concern also. I noticed 4-5 times v Everton he aimed for the fullback and hoofed is straight into touch. Today's modern keepers need to be capable with their feet, i'm not expecting him to be as good as Neuer or Reina but he certainly needs to improve.

For me, what killed it is that they threw away any chance of electoral reform in the UK.  We had a genuine opportunity to move to a fair, modern system.  But by compromising and instead pushing for the unpopular Alternative Vote, not only did we not get the reform then, they've killed it for the foreseeable future - It's now easy to shut down the debate on reform by saying that people have chosen FPTP.  

It was a terrible decision.  As recently as the '90s, we've had a commission tell us that Alternative Vote is a terrible idea.  A lot of people who generally supported electoral reform opposed it.  It was nothing more than an opportunity for the Conservatives to kill any chance of breaking their hold on government.  

We're going to remain stuck without any real choice in our voting, forced to vote for the lesser of two evils.  How many times on /r/Unitedkingdom have you seen someone respond to criticism of the Conservatives with ""But Labour are just as bad""?

On the other hand when I bring up the subject to people who are not technically inclined, such as my parents or sister, I tend to get the impression that they think I'm some sort of paranoid conspiracy theorist who thinks the government is out to get us. 

I think the problem is that people who don't use computers frequently don't see the harm in domestic spying that much, as their life isn't so reliant on technology (apart from the odd Google search and shop on Amazon) like some of us are here.

The value of a building in London is not the same as exactly the same building in, say, Glasgow.  The difference then is the location value, and the occupier is deriving unearned value from the location, and that value is supplied by the surrounding society.  They should therefore be taxed on it for the good of that surrounding society.

It's not popular in the UK (or in this subreddit; I regularly get downvoted for mentioning it) because we are so property mad, but I would prefer we moved from wealth-creation taxes (corporation and income tax) to land value taxes (of which council tax is a bastardised version).  It can't be avoided, and it acts to even out the divide between regions; making the poorer areas more attractive.  It's also progressive in a completely fair way: since you choose the house you live in, and rich people like big, expensive houses.

But the point I try and emphasise is the fact that because this surveillance system exists in the way it does now, there is the practical possibility that people you don't know exist ( or didn't before Snowden), people who you have not voted for and people for which there is no framework of accountability that would satisfy the public, can give the order and have a pretty comprehensive set of information about you.

The party is not a cohesive mixture of opinions and can roughly be divided into two groups, Liberal (libertarian), and lefties. Nick Clegg has been in difficult position where he is trying to appease two completely opposed groups under the same roof, for example the Libertarians favor small government, a vote on the EU (and probably side with the independence team) whereas the lefties favor a larger state and fully support the EU. To present one ""party view"" will always alienate at least half the team.

With this being the case, I'm personally trying to justify the idea of voting for them again. At the moment there are a greater degree of classically liberal policies and conversations coming out of the mouths of conservatives, and should I be inclined to vote on more socialist grounds then Labour is far more likely to actually implement them.

Winchester, perhaps surprisingly to many, isn't just churches and statues and had some fairly large estates and a big student population of trainee teachers, and people that had come there for the Twyford Down protests and settled, so it wasn't necessarily always going to be Tory.

But we can make a fairly straight forward list of things that my taxes would pay for.

Roads &amp; Rail (since private industry seems utterly incapable of expanding/maintining either without direct assistance)

Water

Telecoms

Health

Education

Benefits/Social Assistance

Pollution controls

Libraries

Defence

Emergency Services (Police/Fire/Ambulance/Mountain Rescue etc)

That said, I'm very unhappy with the Liberal Democrats in Government. Not with the things they've done - as /u/whistling_unicorn said, they've achieved [quite a few things in Government](http://www.whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/), and I'm much happier with the policies enacted by this coalition than I would have been with a Conservative-only Government.

I'm unhappy with how bloody *quiet* the Lib Dems have been about their achievements. When a Lib Dem policy is enacted, there's silence. And when there's compromise - which is inevitable in a coalition - the final policy is presented as having coalition support. I feel the Lib Dems would be in a much better position if they said something like
&gt;""We wanted *X*, the Tories wanted *Z*. In the end, we agreed on *Y*, which is closer to *Z* than we would like, but if we have more MPs after the next election, we'd like to move it closer to *X*"".

This is especially true for the whole tuition fees disaster, which has been handled so badly it's embarrassing.

I think Nick Clegg can take a lot of personal blame for this. As the public face of the party, he should have been doing a lot more to trumpet Lib Dem achievements.

Should we all just sit in padded rooms and never leave the house just to remove risk and save lives? You have to draw a line somewhere, and if you can't even show that there's any risk there then you are wayyyyy behind that line.

Yes yes, there is absolutely no risk with average citizens keeping guns at home. You are mad.

&gt;I'm not opposed to reducing risk in all cases, I'm opposed to reducing quality of life in the name of reducing risk when that risk is either very small or non-existent

Come on, why are you so stubborn. Quality of life with a gun? Why do you so desperately need a gun kept at home, even though you can use it only at certain places. This is just a bullshit discussion. You hide behind possible lack of statistics and don't take into account any reasonable measures ""just because"". You can't even give me one reason why a gun kept at home is better than at the professional place? Just because few people want to have fun they can't jeopardize safety of all other citizens as again, it is ridiculously selfish.

I don't trust every gun holder will be keeping his gun in a locked and safely placed cabinet at home and don't play around with it in front of friends etc. Guns can affect my life and I won't be responsible for idiots behaving in a dangerous fashion, just because a person like you justifies made up case without giving reasons and hides behind lack of certain proofs, which can't even be realistically established due to the nature of the research and the fact it would have to be reintroduced first and later judged upon.

&gt;People just don't want to give up the luxury

Car a luxury? Where did you come from, a Wild West? Having a gun and riding a horse? A car is not a luxury any more, wake up. Modern society will NOT exist without transport vehicles and you compare it to guns which don't have any other purpose than shoot a bullet with a usual intention of killing.

our fully fit squad with Johnson and Enrique back with an addition of a left winger is certainly good enough for a CL place finish and even push for a first place contention... 

looking a bit to the future, with loan players returning, Suso, Wisdom etc. our squad would be adequate for league, cups and europe competitions next season. Even if Suarez were to leave...

I could link you to the specific cases if you were interested but the tl;dr: is that ""inciting lawlessness"" via speech is illegal in both countries. That can and does mean whatever the state wants it to mean.

true,Kimi712_,num26,,"&gt;but I think Holtby on loan to Fulham would be good for his development

What'd be good for his development would be to play regular football at a top Premier league club such as ours.

&gt;The best thing for Bentaleb's development right now is to be in and around the first team. 

Getting experience is different from starting games over established starters. I don't mind him being around the first team and even getting subbed in at the end of games. I've always advocated for youth development but this is just crazy. 

&gt;I wonder how much difference that would have made in the end though? City were all over us anyway, and if the result of starting Capoue means we still lost by 2 or 3 goals... then I'm glad that at least Bentaleb got the experience and that Sherwood hopefully now has an idea of what his limits are currently.

I think he would've made a difference. We probably would've lost anyway but every goal counts when we're chasing fourth and our GD is so shit. Beyond that we're alienating solid squad players and by extension future managers. We keep on looking forward for Van Gaal to come in but if players like Capoue and Holtby are already gone by summer and we're starring Livermore and Carroll because of Sherwood, then I have no idea why someone like Van Gaal would still come in. This is so disappointing because at the start of season looking at our squad, I was starting to think we're looking more like teams like Man City, a deep talented squad, and first we have a manager who refuses to adapt to his new players and then another who completely alienates them.

true,kayleighswift,sussex,Sussex,"&gt; Yes yes, there is absolutely no risk with average citizens keeping guns at home. You are mad.

Probably less risk than keeping kitchen knives. I cut myself more time chopping onions than I have accidentally shot myself or someone else with my rifle! People who keep firearms are well aware of the dangers/risks and are thus more careful around guns than most people are around any other potentially dangerous item. The law pretty much mandates that with the FAC application process.

Oh and I already showed you the incredibly low rate of accidents involving firearms in the UK. So I'm not mad, I actually have fact to back up my point, unlike yourself.

&gt;Why do you so desperately need a gun kept at home, even though you can use it only at certain places.

Why do you need a set of golf clubs at home when you can only use them at the course? Why do you need to keep your skis at home when you can only use them on the slopes?

In fact I'd be fine storing a handgun at the range, but the law states that I can't even do *that*.

&gt;You hide behind possible lack of statistics and don't take into account any reasonable measures ""just because"".

The statistics are there. They show that licensed gun owners storing their guns safely does not cause a problem. And of course there are ""reasonable measures"" in place - you have to have an approved gun cabined bolted to a secure wall somewhere out of sight of the casual visitor, and ammunition has to be securely stored in a different container.

If these measures are reasonable enough for rifles and shotguns, then why not handguns?

&gt;You can't even give me one reason why a gun kept at home is better than at the professional place?

You're moving the goalposts. We're debating why we can't have handguns when we can have rifles and shotguns. I'd be fine with keeping my handguns at the range.

&gt;Just because few people want to have fun they can't jeopardize safety of all other citizens as again, it is ridiculously selfish.

But you're completely unable to show how responsible gun owners using handguns jeopardizes the safety of ""all other citizens"". It just doesn't.

&gt;I don't trust every gun holder will be keeping his gun in a locked and safely placed cabinet at home and don't play around with it in front of friends etc.

Then they are an irresponsible gun owner, acting outside of the law and will have their FAC revoked and their firearms confiscated under existing law. Allowing handguns won't change that.

&gt;A car is not a luxury any more, wake up.

A car completely is a luxury. Quite a few people can't afford one, and humanity survived for centuries before they were invented so they're obviously not a necessity.

&gt;Modern society will NOT exist without transport vehicles

""Modern society"", not ""humanity"". Humanity could still exist without today's transport.

&gt;guns which don't have any other purpose than shoot a bullet with a usual intention of killing

False, many guns are designed for target shooting. I've covered this already. You just seem to be of the opinion that ""Guns are bad mmmmkay"" and won't listen to reason.

&gt;Just remember that a small margin of people can't decide how the rest of the nation lives

Don't want to own a gun? Don't own a gun. Don't like gay marriage? Don't get gay married. Don't like fish? Don't eat fish. We're not interested in deciding on your lives, just our own.

* Who will voice concerns even when they're not their own?
* Who will make good arguments and intelligent decisions?

Ultimately who the Prime Minister is, is determined by who has the support of Parliament, so who you vote for can determine who's Prime Minister.

But remember parliament can and does limit what a Prime Minister is able to do, regardless of who the Prime Minister is. So you don't want to sacrifice having a good MP, for maybe influencing who the PM is.

Political parties really want the focus to be on who will be Prime Minister, because it detracts from the individual MPs and makes the role of the Party (and the party leaders) stronger.

I was trying to say that the chimney alarms for are more likely to activate before the parameter alarms. Since they didn't activate then the perimeter alarm is either picking up something else or its failed and isn't recording/ indicating correctly.  The figure is a rough estimate as it's hard to compare counts per minute to mSv.

Going with the BBC report only one alarm activated and if there was something to worry about you would expect them all or most to activate.  When Chernobyl exploded all the alarms sounded. That is when people should start worrying, not when one activates on its own. The staff would have been sent home from work as that action is written in the safety case for emergencies.

Sure, it's not you, it's everyone else - despite my experience already being listed in several ways. Feel free to carry on trying to ascribe any of the above to my opinions alone personally, but as already stated, it's the norm, and generally quite easily verifiable. I'm currently at the end of rolling out Win7/ Office 2010 to 7,500 users, 2/3 of which are on WYSE terminals using Citrix, the rest on desktops. Before that I upgraded the entire site of three domains to 2008R2. My last role was deploying SCCM and packaging apps for desktops at another site (5000+ users). The list is a lot longer than that, but you get the idea - each involved multiple teams of people who did start-to-end projects; UAT testing, scoping, and yes, analysis of alternatives - which, of course, you'd know about without me having to tell you, what with your experience (but hey, I've never done this, know fuck all and it's all ridiculous, right?)

Alternatively, you could have easily asked these questions at the beginning, or given real-world examples instead of waffling, but go on - demonstrate some more of your professionalism, it's coming through in spades. You even make the leap of someone not liking the current Office alternatives to not liking open source at all - another sure sign on industry experience and in no way commonly found in reddit-posting bedroom evangelists.

&gt;because you seem to know fuck all. 

And again, this gives away far too much about your experience, or lack of. You haven't once mentioned any situations or projects involving sizable user numbers, which as someone doing it for a living (or even anyone that didn't but with a decent amount of experience in deployments) you would be doing instead of saying 'fuck', or using giveway guesses dressed as statements, like 'that's what governments are supposed to do' and 'if someone is going to send them a document it had better be in a format they can open' (really, the obvious ignorance is astounding).

&gt;Left industry in early 2000s but still work on a voluntary basis for 2 organisations. 

So, in short, you haven't done it professionally for about ten years, and by the looks of things (development) haven't done actual support for around twenty. Please, my sides hurt with the shock.

&gt;Your answer is really fucking ridiculous. All of it.

Depending on what you mean by 'consequences' I have a problem with this.  It's *not* a free speech culture if those consequences are to punish people for expressing opinions you don't like.  

Imagine if people warned you that there will be 'consequences' if you express opinions that they don't like.  Imagine if those consequences involved the threat that you could lose your job and be ostracized from society for e.g. supporting gay marriage.  Is that really a culture of 'free-speech'?  

Being a supporter of free speech isn't about supporting the right of people you agree with to express their ideas.  That's easy.   We all support that.  Rather, it's how far you're willing to go in order to allow speech you despise.

BM:"" These supporters are a one off. I appreciate all the support. Nothing matters other than tomorrow . Its a great job &amp; I love it.""""

He also said regarding it being his last game that he you never know in management but he'll ""really enjoy it.""

Pope saying that with Cellino in the box seat there are **moves afoot to bring in some Italian players.**

Former Cagliari press officer tweets the deal is done.

**Farnan story trickling out saying that they still want to negotiate and take over and that they have funds in place etc.**

[Here it is posted by LUST](http://lufctrust.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/31/statement-from-mike-farnan-together-leeds.html) and [here posted by the Yorkshire post](http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-utd/farnan-group-in-plea-to-leeds-as-italian-sale-hovers-on-brink-1-6410689?utm_content=buffer34546&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer)

A freelance journalist has reported he has posted on twitter: ""Spoke to Massimo Cellino.Said doesn't know if #lufc deal gone through.Going into office to find out.But said:""**I need a coach not a manager.""""**

[This article from the YEP](http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/leeds-united-farnan-consortium-make-urgent-plea-to-gfh-to-step-up-takeover-talks-1-6410686) details the Farnan release as well as importantly saying that their original bid was **""significantly in excess of the amount publicly reported.""**

Hay thinks the Farnan group seems more positive as **they think the FL will block Cellino**

BBC Leeds: NEWS: **Italian Massimo Cellino expected shortly to close deal for majority stake of #LUFC pending @football_league approval. (via @WYSDaily)**

Farnan comes and backs McDermott on twitter as well as saying ""we will be there til the end.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes and no... they made their own bed (the Lib Dems, that is) and should therefore lie in it.  

Sure they should, but it isn't all about the Lib Dems by any means. We have a system that systematically narrows our voting options and makes it very difficult for any party outside of the big two - no matter how sane - to make any headway at all. Duverger's Law tells us that. As a result, we're left with this stultifying choice of two and a half parties that most people accept are habitually dishonest but vote for anyway. And who has the power to change our inequitable and barely democratic electoral system? Only the two big parties that benefit from retaining it. That is a stitch-up.

In any case, the consequences of dishonesty are dramatically different for different parties. When the Lib Dems are dishonest, ""making their bed and lying in it"" can mean huge electoral losses and a potentially permanent loss of political relevance; in other words, destruction as a political force. When the Conservatives or Labour are dishonest - which they are, demonstrably and incessantly - people shrug their shoulders and go back to voting for whichever tribe they usually vote for regardless. At worst, the party might spend a few years in opposition and then get elected back into government, but even that level of accountability seems a bit optimistic.  

Nobody really votes for Labour or the Conservatives based on a track-record of honesty, do they? But they still vote for them, in their millions. Meanwhile, people will decide never to vote for a smaller party ever again precisely because of an example of dishonesty.

This is the first parliament I've really paid attention to, and from what I have seen policies are expendable; it's principles one should really vote on.

Even when someone comes to office intending to fulfill their pledges they still have to face the reality of the political and economic climate at home and abroad. For instance, it is likely in the next parliament the minimum wage will be raised – even Osborne has pledged as such. This has little to do with the merits of such a policy and a lot to do with the appetite for it. That is political reality. And when political reality hits policies are the first thing to be auctioned off.

Assuming their is any vestige of principle left in politicians, the best you can expect from them is to tack one way or the other. The minimum wage will be raised, but it is still debatable how high the rise will be. As social marketeers the Lib Dems and Labour will push it as high as politically expedient, and as free marketeers the Conservatives will push it as low as politically expedient. I'd say the best way to vote is with this in mind, adapted to the iniquities of your particular constituency.

Workers in Britain have seen stagnant wages for over 40 years, the recent fall in wages (i.e. around 13% for all workers) is due partly the attack on the welfare state (the weaker the welfare state the lower the wages in general) but also due to the systematic readjustments that follow any recession. Capital must readjust and reassert its power, which involves a structural attack upon labour and the gains made by labour since the last recession. After a period of readjustment market forces will increase wages to increase the spending by workers further increasing capital production and circulation (until the next recession where the cycle will repeat itself).

Alternatively, you might be in Galloway's seat, or stuck with a green candidate who is probably certifiably insane.

Our political system is based on you sitting down, working out the people who you are choosing between and deciding who is the person you like or trust the most. If you arbitrarily decide to prejudge candidates because of their party then that can only worsen the situation.

Why would I not be critical of the Conservatives? They are rather obviously the lazy end of politics. They look after the minority and opt for the simplest and stupidest libertarian options without a care for consequences or long term outcomes.

* Students were assaulted by hired security staff when they tried to enter their own buildings

* Students eventually occupied a hall peacefully and left peacefully

* Students were then kettled illegally for 4 hours in the cold without access to food, water or toilets. One student collapsed, an ambulance was called by police wouldn't let either the ambulance into the university nor the student out of the kettle. Eventually the student was taken to hospital

* After 4 hours students were allowed the leave the kettle on condition they give their name and addresses, and do so on camera, and also required to be searched, those who refused this process were arrested on the spot. These acts by the police were clearly unlawful as the [High Court had *""ruled that it was unlawful for the police to require people to provide their names and addresses as a condition of release from a kettle or containment.""*](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/18/police-unlawful-cuts-protest-kettling)

* Those students unlawfully arrested for refusing to give their details were held in police custody for over 30 hours, several were also strip searched. Two of the students have appeared in magistrates court this morning. The two Birmingham students arrested were suspended by the university of Birmingham.

* The bail conditions of those students held in custody but now released **without charge** include no entry onto any University campus, no association with co-arrestees, residing EVERY night at home address, and not congregate in groups. (in some cases this bail conditions conflict i.e. some on bail live together).

I did wonder where the fascist hide, now I've realised, it's on the internet. These students are fighting for a different type of education, fighting for workers to earn enough to live, fighting against the tyranny of management, of course they will be opposed by the state and managers, and of course there will be fascists and sheeple willing to condemn any damaged to property whilst caring little about damage to people. Fascists who hate violence as long as you don't wear a police uniform or a security jacket. Fascists who are always willing to use the most absurd and illogical excuses to crush dissent and protest, excuses from ""they're blocking the road"" or ""it's against health and safety"" or ""they trespassed"". Students are willing to stand up and fight for what they believe in, cowards and those who believe in nothing will always condemn those they envy. Fascists who would condemn the Arab Spring for causing disruption; fascist who are welcoming the strengthening police state, the crushing a movement before it begins and the killing of those who envision a different world.

I think the most power to be gained from spying is because one party has something abnormal/unusual they want to hide from another. Perhaps this is political views, sexuality, illegality or immorality (which is subjective). The power comes from being able to isolate this party as a minority.

However, if you made everyone's secrets public, wouldn't the norms change? Take homosexuality, it has become widely accepted in recent years and I think this is purely because so many gay people are now out in the open - I'd say that most people probably know a few people who are homosexual.

If things are out in the open, then minorities can more easily organise and so better represent themselves to the rest of the population. Not only that, but people become desensitised to things - 10 years ago, I'd be a bit surprised if I saw two men holding hands in public, now it doesn't even register as something out of the ordinary, just something you see.

Homosexuality is just an example. It also works the other way, I'm now surprised if someone tells me they go to church compared to maybe 10 years ago when it seemed somewhat common.

* Students were then kettled illegally for 4 hours in the cold without access to food, water or toilets. One student collapsed, an ambulance was called by police wouldn't let either the ambulance into the university nor the student out of the kettle. Eventually the student was taken to hospital

* After 4 hours students were allowed the leave the kettle on condition they give their name and addresses, and do so on camera, and also required to be searched, those who refused this process were arrested on the spot. These acts by the police were clearly unlawful as the [High Court had *""ruled that it was unlawful for the police to require people to provide their names and addresses as a condition of release from a kettle or containment.""*](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/18/police-unlawful-cuts-protest-kettling)

* Those students unlawfully arrested for refusing to give their details were held in police custody for over 30 hours, several were also strip searched. Two of the students have appeared in magistrates court this morning. The two Birmingham students arrested were suspended by the university of Birmingham without the right of appeal.

* The bail conditions of those students held in custody but now released **without charge** include no entry onto any University campus, no association with co-arrestees, residing EVERY night at home address, and not congregate in groups. (in some cases this bail conditions conflict i.e. some on bail live together).

I did wonder where the fascist hide, now I've realised, it's on the internet. These students are fighting for a different type of education, fighting for workers to earn enough to live, fighting against the tyranny of management, of course they will be opposed by the state and managers, and of course there will be fascists and sheeple willing to condemn any damaged to property whilst caring little about damage to people. Fascists who hate violence as long as you don't wear a police uniform or a security jacket. Fascists who are always willing to use the most absurd and illogical excuses to crush dissent and protest, who say they support 'peaceful protest' but in reality are always against it with excuses from ""they're blocking the road"" or ""it's against health and safety"" or ""they trespassed"". Students are willing to stand up and fight for what they believe in, cowards and those who believe in nothing will always condemn those they envy. Fascists who would condemn the Arab Spring for causing disruption; fascist who are welcoming the strengthening police state, the crushing a movement before it begins and the killing of those who envision a different world.

European election: UKIP

General election: Anyone other than LIB,LAB,CON. Pirate party,green,respect or any independent who isn't bat shit crazy. If non of the alternatives are available spoil my paper.

EE: I don't think the EU works. UKIP appears to be the only party who is really interested in leaving the EU. Whilst I think it is important that we don't cut ourselves off from our neighbors and I don't think immigration is actually as bad as the party sometimes makes out. I don't like the fact that some unelected official in another country should tell me what I can and can't do in my own country.

GE: LIBLABCON are basically the same, yes LAB is the nicer of the trio perhaps, but they still don't vear too left of center and are a long way away (thanks in part to the war criminal) from being the party of and for the workers. My choice is really between a protest vote or a no vote. I don't actively champion any political party, I pick and choose aspects from each that I like. 

I don't think the voting system we have is fit for purpose. I'd like to have a say on everything that directly concerns me. That's what democracy is right? A slightly apathetic answer but it's hard not to be when you are given a choose between several incompetent misguided twats.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;what politicians do matters,

Calling Cameron lazy and posh contributes nothing to the political debate, or are even actually comments on what he does.  They're just and attempt at a personal attack.

&gt;Why would I not be critical of the Conservatives? They are rather obviously the lazy end of politics. They look after the minority and opt for the simplest and stupidest libertarian options without a care for consequences or long term outcomes.

Partisan nonsense / rhetoric again. 

&gt;Sigh. Partisan much? So what, even if you were correct, that doesn't excuse the Conservatives.. it's not just about doing the opposite stupidity to that of the Labour party!

Not partisan at all.  I'm not a die hard supporter of any political party.  Just pointing out facts, which sadly don't appear to the basis for the soapbox you're up on.  The point is both Labour and the Conservatives want to be able to spy on you.  You'd better believe the Lib Dems would be up for it as well given half a chance.  

&gt;I don't know what education he had or what value the like of the Bullingdon club instill 

And yet you feel qualified to speak on how that upbringing affects his politics?

&gt;where he's not got sense to temper the sharp end of that nasty party.

It's politics.  To continue he needs the support of his party, which includes those that lean to the far left *and* the far right of the party.  Every political party has a lunatic element; yet none of the party leaders are desperate to go to war with their own party.  Again, it's hardly a uniquely Conservative problem.

The land registry records the sale price, so you simply use a percentage of that average.  Zoopla et al already do a reasonable job of applying land registry prices interpolated over time to give you an estimate of your property value.  Exactly the same mechanism could be used.

While it's true that that includes the houses themselves, the only difference that would make is a change of percentage, but since that's arbitrarily chosen by government anyway, it wouldn't matter.  It's also fair to say that a rundown house devalues its neighbours as well, so it all compensates very nicely -- the location value is lower if the average is lowered because of tumbledown houses.

If we wanted to get more complicated, I suppose you could add up land area, property area, and house square footage as your input factors.  That's probably over complicating things though.  In the end people want their houses to be worth as much as possible, but want to pay the least amount of tax.  These two push against each other and an equilibrium is found.

true,Sgt_General,null,null,"First of all, welcome to this great club (and humble Reddit community)! Supporting Leeds has truly given me some of the best, most exhilarating moments of my life, although it also has the capacity to make one feel down and even angry. Unlike the top dogs of football, like Barcelona and Real Madrid whose fans can expect trophies and great football every season, Leeds United has always been a club that flirts with success but never masters it, making our triumphant moments all the sweeter. It really is an emotional roller coaster.

The others have done a fantastic job of explaining the club and its history to you, so I just thought that I'd add some random pieces of information that might help to flesh out the club for you.

* If you've ever seen a football match with one team absolutely dominating the other, you might have noticed that they just pass the ball about and maintain possession without really going anywhere, while the fans yell ""Ole!"" every time the ball reaches a player. It is widely believed that Don Revie's great Leeds United side popularised this in the English game. If memory serves correctly, they first did this when they beat Southampton 7-0 at home in the 71-72 season and were heavily criticised by the media and other football teams for disrespecting the other team. [Here's a video of it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wweh3ROiqWI)

* Leeds United also popularised the pre-match warm-up in front of the fans before a game. In the past, teams didn't do this before every single game like they do now, but Leeds were one of the - if not *the* - first do this, to improve the relationship between players and fans.

* If you're new to supporting Leeds United, you're going to have to get used to fans of every other club disliking your club and sometimes even the fact that you support them. Obviously this various from region to region, and you probably won't notice it in the States, but Leeds United is very much a club with an ""it's us against the world"" mentality. The list of people who hate us and people we hate is longer than Santa's naughty list. Even to this day, in stadiums all over England, fans still sing ""We all hate Leeds scum!"" on match days.

* Ill feelings towards Leeds United extend right up to the FA and even UEFA. We've learned not to ever expect any help from them, as we've been screwed over countless times by these organisations. Ray Tinkler, a referee, infamously cost us the title in the 70/71 season when he controversially disallowed a goal against West Brom before deeming an offside goal scored by them perfectly valid. In that same season, the FA had refused to rearrange Leeds United's fixtures, which were heavily congested with Leeds reaching the finals of (and winning) the Fairs Cup, better known as the UEFA Cup, and reaching advanced stages of domestic cup competitions. In 1973 Leeds United were defeated by AC Milan in the final of the Cup Winners Cup, a match in which the referee was bribed by the Italian side. UEFA recognised this in recent years, but allowed Milan to keep the trophy. Then there was the aforementioned 1975 European Cup final, with its dodgy linesman. Unfair treatment has even been seen in modern times, when Lee Bowyer was retroactively banned by UEFA for stamping on a player during the 00/01 season when we reached the Champions League semi-finals. When was the last time you heard of a player getting retroactively banned by UEFA?

* One thing football fans - especially Leeds fans - are good at is old fashioned gallows' humour. That's why we joke about Norwich signing all our good players and suggest that Michael Brown is probably the best player ever. Considering all the crazy stuff that's happened, it's one of the few things that keeps us sane!

* It's not all doom and gloom, though! Here's my favourite Leeds match ever (I was lucky enough be in attendance) to show you that good things do happen. It was the last day of the 09/10 season, a win for Leeds would see them automatically promoted from League One, a draw might still do it depending on results and a loss would see us compete in the Play-Offs, which we have **never** won once (even though we competed in the very first Division Two Play-Off campaign). It all came down to [Leeds United vs Bristol Rovers.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bNaAV2EB9o)

 However that's not to say there aren't shitty male fans as well. I've met some people who call Eccleston the ""first"" doctor. Its fine to have skipped some of the classic era, its not for everyone, but you should at least acknowledge its existence and in my opinion see ONE episode.

Guess he doesn't grasp how a DoF situation actually works, DoF gets the players in and the coach makes it work.  The idea is that you take the pressure off the coach in terms of personnel scouting/recruitment so they can focus on the squad.  Feedback goes to the DoF but ultimately the DoF makes the decision on who comes and goes not the manager.

From my own experience, Analytical data IS and will continue to be used purely for the cost benefit it provides. Using data to identify ""at risk"" groups which can automate the process of bringing patients in for check ups ect is much most cost effective than treating an illness which has already developed.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;A car completely is a luxury. Quite a few people can't afford one, and humanity survived for centuries before they were invented so they're obviously not a necessity

Humanity survived but won't survive easily without them now. This is again a no good example of comparison of a car to a gun.

&gt;But you're completely unable to show how responsible gun owners using handguns jeopardizes the safety of ""all other citizens"". It just doesn't.

Yes it does. As I have told you, you cannot guarantee all will be responsible. It's like with your car example, people are just constructed in a way there will always be a certain number of idiots. Even if majority of possible gun owners were responsible, even a small number like 5% can have a huge impact, especially that we are talking about holding a weapon, not a pet (funnily though, even some pets - dogs are forbidden to be kept because they were bread with one purpose - to be aggressive and to fight).

You shouldn't introduce a change in the law based on assumptions that ""majority"" will be responsible with a connection of a gun, something which was invented with a sole purpose of killing a person. Just because a small number of people enjoy guns responsibly for a sport, it doesn't mean that more guns should be allowed.

&gt;False, many guns are designed for target shooting. I've covered this already. You just seem to be of the opinion that ""Guns are bad mmmmkay"" and won't listen to reason.

Dude I have told you I have nothing against target shooting. Use your gun responsibly at the shooting range or when hunting. It's not necessary to have more small guns given to people as you still have your sport and can enjoy it with the types of guns you can use now for that purpose.

&gt;Don't want to own a gun? Don't own a gun. Don't like gay marriage? Don't get gay married. Don't like fish? Don't eat fish. We're not interested in deciding on your lives, just our own.

Nobody will force me to be gay, nor gay person can affect me directly. If he hits on me I would just tell him I'm not interested or to bug of. The same applies with fish and other silly examples. A person CAN force me with a gun to do things. It directly affects me. More guns with private people means higher risk of gun crime and whatever you say this is a FACT.

&gt;You're moving the goalposts. We're debating why we can't have handguns when we can have rifles and shotguns. I'd be fine with keeping my handguns at the range.

Maybe because small arms are easier to conceal and more popular with criminals?

&gt;Probably less risk than keeping kitchen knives.

Yeah, but you do need a knife as otherwise how will you cut food at the kitchen? You don't need a gun for any other purpose than for a sport, meaning knifes are useful and risk is taken into account. Guns are not useful in any other way.

&gt;People who keep firearms are well aware of the dangers/risks and are thus more careful around guns than most people are around any other potentially dangerous item.

But we are talking about irresponsible people here who will be allowed to have a gun in that situation and as I already mentioned, you cannot guarantee everybody will be responsible here.

&gt;If these measures are reasonable enough for rifles and shotguns, then why not handguns?

If it was for me I would ban keeping any guns as well as ban distribution of real imitation guns, which can very well be used in a crime just because they look real. If someone wants to have fun at the range then they will supply you with a gun. Around 11k offences with the use of guns for a year is a pretty high number, meaning that more bans and controls should be introduced, not other way around.

Finally, just Hungerford and Dunblane massacre should be enough reasons to restrict use of guns. You are fucking terribly selfish for wanting a gun for a ""sport"" where 17 kids were killed by an idiot who actually was allowed to legally hold a gun. Cumbria shooting gives an example where even rifles should be banned and it doesn't matter that it was only few exceptions. People died. Do you know what it is when a person dies? You lose your loved one? Just because some pathetic morons don't want to accept regulations and safety of guns because they are terribly selfish and think their sport and allowing them to keep guns at home (for fuck sake knowing reason) is the most important thing in the world, it doesn't give them any right to endanger other human beings.

And yes, guns are bad in general. There are required and useful by special forces and in exceptional circumstances but shouldn't be given away like a candy. Comparison with knifes or cars isn't proper as cars and knifes do have other uses and very originally invented with those other uses in mind, not to kill (like guns). Just because a small number of people use guns for a sport then tough luck, take harsher conditions or change a sport if you don't like it or emigrate to an idiotic USA where in XXI century they are still in the Wild West.

Hold on.  You're criticising Cameron for lazy politics because he's making assumptions about what the public wants, and yet you feel the *actual* attitude of the public has no bearing on that statement?

&gt;it's about getting Government to do what is right by the People that they are meant to represent widely.

Honestly, this sounds like something a 12 year old would say if they were asked what Government was.  They're elected to govern for their term, and while I don't like being spied on, I'm aware that having a public referendum for every decision they make is unworkable.  If the country doesn't like it, they'll vote them out and the end of their term.

Possibly yes. There is a long way to go to prove that. Which is pretty much the entire point of my argument. The evidence is heavily stacked against this coroners finding so much so that it's really completely irrelevant unless it's backed up with additional observations.

Ideally all of them are connected at the hip, but the idea is to take the work load off the manager so he can focus on the team. As the game becomes increasingly global it becomes a big ask for a manager to maintain a working knowledge of players around the world.  So the DoF along with the DoS deal with finding the players and recruiting them.  If they are young the Technical Director deals with the development.

The head coach gets input but is only one of several voices on the ultimate decision. Most times if a club utilizes a DoF the DoF can still bring players in if they deem it the right move.

Moses has shown he can be a good player but the majority of the time he's spent on the pitch he's looked uninterested and the majority of people seem to agree that he's looked uninterested and so thats why a lot of people are against a move for him, they are not interested in a player that is only interested when his circumstances change, we want player playing to the death no matter what

for 'our player' us people will support a player that wants to help the team and not himself, if he's bad why shouldnt we be able to say he's been bad?

I'm going to need a source for that.

&gt;why does this make less sense to you than her trying to cover for a drifter criminal (Guede) whom she barely even knew existed?

Perhaps because she was in fact involved in the murder and as such she didn't want to lead the police to someone who could reveal her involvement in the crime.

&gt;The 50 hours was the total she had been questioned since the murder. Plenty of time for skilled inquisitors to make a girl like Know question her own sanity.

Except she signed her statement at 1.45, only 1-2 hours into the interrogation. To me it seems evident that when presented with the fact that Sollectio had withdrawn his alibi for her, she immediately panicked and came up with a vague and ridiculous story about how her African boss killed Meredith.

This was the best government we are going to get. A Brown win would have been a nightmare. The result of the election made a Lib Lab coalition impossible. They don't have enough seats between them, something which too many Labour tribalists ignore. The Conservative party ruling alone would have been awful. The LibDems have done a great job holding the tories back and the anger we can see now from the crazy right is a great demonstration of just what a great job it is. 

The important thing now is that the conservatives must not govern alone after 2015. That would effectively destroy Britain.

From a less biased article ...

""Officers were called to the Edgbaston site at around 5pm following reports of demonstrators breaking down doors, hurling smoke bombs in corridors and allegations of assaults against campus staff.""

So that's what witnesses said, so it would seem that you're probably just minimizing the issue in a vain attempt to justify it - but whatever, let's give you the benefit of the doubt ... why is *any* amount of vandalism justified? Aren't you supposed to be peaceful protesters?

&gt; Students were assaulted by hired security staff when they tried to enter their own buildings

Again, from the article ...

""Several of those arrested are from Birmingham but others hail from Cambridge, Nottingham, Leicester, London, Leeds, Rugby and Buckinghamshire.""

They were not ""students trying to get into buildings"" in their own campus, they were an organized militant protest hell-bent on causing trouble. And in any case, if the buildings were locked, what *right* exactly does any student have to force entry?

&gt; Students were then kettled illegally for 4 hours in the cold without access to food, water or toilets.

Oh, the poor fucking loves. I really hope when they got home, mummy gave them something warm. Fucks sake, this really is the epitome of the modern ""militant"", all tough-guy when it comes to breaking in, vandalizing and shouting at the police, but suddenly ""weak as a kitten"" if someone doesn't feed and water them after 4 hours?

&gt; After 4 hours students were allowed the leave the kettle on condition they give their name and addresses, and do so on camera, and also required to be searched, those who refused this process were arrested on the spot.

So instead of arresting 500+ people, they arrested 14. Seems like common sense to me. If you don't want to give the information voluntarily, you will be arrested and forced to give it up anyway. So 386+ people went home after giving their name and address, and 14 idiots spent a day and a half in the cells after being arrested, and ended up imparting **exactly the same information** to the police.

&gt; Those students unlawfully arrested for refusing to give their details were held in police custody for over 30 hours, several were also strip searched.

&gt; The bail conditions of those students held in custody but now released *without charge*

Yes, it's called being arrested and released without charge. Once you are arrested, you can be searched. They do not HAVE to arrest AND charge, the two are not mutually inclusive. Are you really this dense? The fact they were released does not mean they should not have been arrested in the first place, so your emphasis demonstrates nothing.

&gt; I did wonder where the fascist hide, now I've realised, it's on the internet [snip the rest of unnecessary bullshit spiel].

And if all else fails, resort to name calling. I *know* where the militants are also, and they do not hide. They misrepresent the facts to suit their agenda, and follow an ideology that didn't work in the 70's and *still* doesn't work 40 years later.

Things are changing all the time, even the worst economic policy in a global boom would deliver growth, and the best economic policy in a global crisis would have problems.

As ever, there's an element of crystal balling it, but the question is about calculating your NPV. Where will be if we follow doctrine A vs doctrine B. As others have pointed out, austerity doesn't mean not spending, it means not investing. Labour government might have extended the house, but the con-dem government still would have paid the gas bills.

So you plot where you are in t+0, t+1, t+2 and so on and try to evaluate where we would be had we adopted an alternate policy. It's broadly agreed by economists internationally that reducing the deficit is good, but doing it by simply halting crucial investment will cause a bigger loss in the long run.

But it's the same problem with leaving money on the table - prospect theory and economic anchoring. People don't really care if we are *relatively poorer* for bad economic doctrine so long as we are *absolutely richer*. If unemployment is down, that's great - and people don't tend to complain that it's not down more.

It's funny though, because in absolute terms, we are still behind France and Germany's cumulative change in output since 2007, but we are currently growing our (smaller) output faster, so people think that means we're doing better.

The decision is still the patient's, the doctor is just the tool by which that decision is carried out. I guess people place different value on the physical action.

Autonomy is all about context, true, but in this context you're doing harm to prevent further harm... so the two concepts don't necessarily have to be in opposition. If/when these laws come in, they'll be on a very specific case by case basis, and I imagine there will be a great deal of assessment that goes on. It wouldn't be ""needless""... and I think that's an important distinction. I know you're making a broader point about autonomy there, but it changes the situation entirely. It would depend at what point in their illness a person was at, you couldn't just demand to be euthanised as soon as you're diagnosed.

From a practical point of view, now that we're at the point where people can travel to clinics in Switzerland or whatever for assisted suicide, then it just makes more sense to allow them to do it in their own country.

true,MustTry,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;I can't remember where I read definitely that that knew it was African hair, but I did read that, and they definitely had what we now know was Guede's hair being tested at the time, and African hair can easily by identified as distinct without DNA testing. They certainly knew the killer was African by the time of these statements.

No source; no believe. 

&gt;Yes, you're right, the story about Lumumba was absolutely preposterous. I'm glad you agree. So you must agree that the police were idiots to condemn him, especially when Knox recanted that story just a few hours later. They sure did look stupid when it turned out Guede was the killer and not Lumumba, and they've been doing their best heap more piles of dung onto the pile they had already constructed to cover their incompetence. In fact, that's when I (and most of America) first started paying attention to this case. When they found the real killer but still kept trying to hammer that square peg into a round hole and convict those two innocents.

The police are racist in Italy, so it doesn't seem preposterous to me that they would automatically assume that an 'innocent' white girl was telling the truth particularly if she fingered a black man.

As for recanting her statement a few hours later. This is a lie, the only time when she informs anyone that her statement is false was on 10th of November when she told her mother. Neither she nor her mother bothered to inform their lawyers or the police about this. Hence why Lumumba was held by the police for over 3 weeks and was only released after his alibi proved to be watertight.

It is far, far from such a system. I would be a supporter of a graduate tax but what we have represents nothing of the sort. 

* Students (or more likely parents) who are wealthy enough to pay up front pay £27,000 and experience no tax.
* Students who take a loan and graduate to have middle incomes are unlikely to pay off the ~£50,000 average debt (remember whilst studying it compounds at RPI + 3%, which is currently **6.3%**) and are faced with a 30 year graduate tax. Students who graduate to high income salaries may pay off their debt early and may pay more/less than those on average incomes dependent on the rate at which they pay off.
* Only those who graduate into low enough salaries that they do not repay/repay at a very low rate will be better off than those with the finances to pay up front!

In essence we have a system that is a graduate tax (though more truly a debt - that is in the process of being privatised) on those unable to pay up front and a fee cheaper than the average private school for those who can; failing to exploit the potential to tax many who will inevitably be the highest earners.

I watched Blink and immediately fell in love with the show.  I went back and watched every episode of NuWho (I'm still playing catch up though, I'm about half way through Series 6).

I got two friends hooked on Who also and it was fairly easy.  Since I enjoyed Blink so much right away, that's the episode I chose to show them first.  However, I was careful to explain that this episode is really different, and since Blink doesn't really explain a lot of things, I explained who the Doctor is and what he does and who his enemies are and stuff like that so that they would understand what's going on.  Both of them fucking loved Blink too.  They stuck around so I said that I was going to watch the next episode that I needed to watch (for the one friend I think it was an Eccleston episode and for the other I think it was a Tennant episode but I forget which) and that was it, they were officially both Whovians.

true,goolies,null,null,"&gt;Let's assume the maximum of about 9000 per year with a 3 year degree (27000)

The Tuition fee (and maintenance, which is neglected here) loans compound at RPI (N.B. The higher of the 2 standards of measuring inflation) + 3% whilst studying. Currently that is **6.3%**. Last year that was **6.6%**. Assuming RPI stays constant the average 2015 graduate will instead have ~£30,500 debt. The debt also accumulates at RPI whilst earning below payment threshold and above that a variable amount up to a max of RPI + 3% dependent on income.

&gt;student loans are written off 25 years after it's taken out in the new scheme (35 in Scotland due to the law there) see here

Actually, and this may explain something of your fumbling with figures, that refers to Plan 1 i.e. the previous scheme. Post-2012 loans are written off after 30 years [(see here)](http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678775&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL).

&gt; At 5% over 22,000, with an average pay of 30,000 you'd pay back £400

Actually [(see here again)](http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678784&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL) the amount paid is 9% on over 21K.

The problem is this system is a botched graduate tax that will end up hitting those on middle incomes. Those able to pay up front, who will almost certainly be some of the highest earners, get away relatively cheaply as do those who graduate to earn very little. The rest pay a disproportionately large proportion through this economically unsound system.

What expectations does your current companies you work/worked for have? Are they expecting you to hit certain targets or are they just expecting you to work hard. 

The thing is I am a hard worker. I will do my best but I want to understand how understanding these recruitment companies are. It takes time to get better and I don't really want to enter a industry that chews and spits out graduates that either has ""it"" or not. 

Was it sink or swim in this new place you work?

How was OTE calculated and what was the expectation for a new consultant/trainee?

Also if I may ask what's your personality like or the colleagues you work with like. I ask because I want to know if it attracts/works well with a specific type of person.

Can you say how much your salary is and how it changed over time.

And one last question: Do you feel stuck in this sector now? As in feel like you can't move onto other roles.

It wouldn't surprise me at all if they kept Kenny in goal, as he is one of the best 'keepers in the league, while Watford held on to the likes of Nyron Nosworthy and Lloyd Doyley, who are in my opinion two big lumps with little football ability, so there's a good chance we would keep Pearce as he's very solid in defence.

Then again, Watford is the only example I have to base my opinion on, so I'm guessing that Cellino and Festa would want to play good, continental-style football which would surely mean holding on to our good football players like Byram, Mowatt and McCormack; anyone who can adapt to the style. These would then be supplemented by Italian players, which is a cause for concern because they would presumably have no care nor respect for the club.

However, what really worries me is the high turnover of managers during Cellino's time at Cagliari, not to mention how he showed no regard for the club's legacy and stadium. From what I've heard, he's happy to keep the club mid-table in the Serie A, so that he's still raking in money from Sky but not required to build on any infrastructure with them not getting into Europe. Festa would clearly be a yes-man to Cellino, if he lasts for any length of time, and would no doubt be subject to ridiculous demands like running the squad and starting line-up past him before every game.

It's a very worrying prospect, not because the bloke is Italian and clearly wants to bring all his countrymen over, but because he has a horrible reputation and would turn the club upside-down.",0,1391188099,null,0,false,0,cf3ovz7,t3_1wnlb7,t1_cf3ovz7,t3_1wnlb7,null,1432192448,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

* [There's the Who Shop](http://thewhoshop.com/) dedicated to Doctor Who merch. Closest tube station is Upton Park, its a little out the way of Central London going toward West London along the District and Metropolitan lines but could be worth the tube ride over. Upton Park is a bit of a shit hole though.

* [Otherwise, I'd highly recommend Forbidden Planet!](https://forbiddenplanet.com/) Much more Central London close to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station, it's a cult mega store with a really great doctor who section and other various Doctor Who books and comics in the comics section downstairs. I was there earlier today and they had some new giant vinyls toys in. Definitely worth a pop in, be on the look out for signings! Its also between Oxford Street and Covent Garden so general sight seeing/shopping opportunities there.

* [There's also Hamley's](http://www.hamleys.com/) thats on Regents Street, closest Tube is Oxford Circus but thats more of a toy shop than a Cult Store (stick to Forbidden Planet)

* [How about an actual Tardis? There's a Blue Police Box by Earls Court Tube Station](http://i1.cdnds.net/13/11/618x370/odd-police-box.jpg) which is always a laugh to go see, it's not far out the way, quick tube ride. (If you're going to be travelling by tube a lot, tube fares rack up so get an all day travel card or something, but walking is sometimes a good option too with only the occasion tube jaunt if needed).

* David Tennant is usually doing a bit of theartre (he's doing something right now) so see if he's doing anything in June and go watch the man behind the 10th Doctor!

* Dotted around London and parts of the country are various museums dedicated to Romans and The 1st and 2nd War, notable settings from Doctor Who stories, I'll get back to you with links to those if I find really good ones.

You could also easily visit various parts of London which have been featured in Doctor Who. I'll recommend the more popular places: 

* Trafalgar Square and The National Gallery which is free to get into from the recent 50th special. Go see where UNIT landed the Tardis and take the steps the Doctor took up to the Gallery.

* A short walk down the road is The Houses of Parliament where the Slitheen crashed a space ship into Big Ben and near by is a statue of Winston Churchill, friend of the Doctor! Across the river is the London Eye (another fun thing to do) where 9 discovered it was the Autons transmitter and The Southbank where 11 and Clara materialised the next morning. 
You'll also pass Downing Street where Harriet Jones governed as Prime Minister! (Pro tip: theres also the Namco Funscape before you reach the London Eye, which is a pretty neat arcade. We used to have a much better one in Piccadilly Circus but it closed down so reward your London trekking with some video games) 

* [Why not check out the Globe Theatre](http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/) where 10 and Shakespeare defeated the Carrionites! That ones close to Southwark, the Tate Modern and the City of London for more sight seeing.

* [And in the City of London you've got The Shard!](http://www.theviewfromtheshard.com/) where 11 drove a Spoonhead up with his Anti-Grav Motorcycle. You can get tickets to go visit the top!

* [And don't forget the Tower of London](http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/) where UNIT are based!

* Also pop into your local Tescos or Sainsburys to pick up some Jammie Dodgers, fish fingers and custard. Can't go wrong with a bit of Ambrosia Devon Custard!",0,1391189732,null,0,1391198804,0,cf3pmtc,t3_1wndkj,t1_cf3pmtc,t3_1wndkj,null,1432192799,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

true,kde01,king,,"Good. We don't need to sign more players right now. We need to get the players we have clicking. They have started that in the last few weeks and bringing in new players would only slow that process down.

For all of you getting angry at Sherwood and saying he has no idea what he's doing, you have *no idea* what you're talking about. What will signing more players do for us? Will it guarantee fourth spot? No. Will it guarantee Europa League? No. It won't do anything except potentially unsettle more of our current players and might force us to restart the whole attempt at building a single unified squad.

Leave new player purchases for the summer. Integrate everyone we have now, and work on getting more boys in during the summer. We have an idea of who we need, but we want a harmonious team (which may mean needing to sell some of the players like Capoue that seem to be complaining a lot behind the scenes) that knows how to play together.

Look at Arsenal as the prime example of this. They don't really have the strongest squad in the league. They don't have the absolute best player in any position (there's a very strong argument for Ozil, however). What they do have, however, is harmony and teamwork. They have all been playing together for so long that they instinctively know where their teammates will be and what they will do. If our boys had that level of understanding there's nothing saying we couldn't be challenging for top spot right now. 

Wenger got it right. He brings in very few players, and builds up his core. He keeps the players he has happy and keeps a very good relationship amongst the squad. Buying a ton of players in the summer and then bringing in *more* during the winter will never achieve either of those things.",0,1391189957,null,0,false,0,cf3pqkp,t3_1wn9pf,t1_cf3pqkp,t3_1wn9pf,null,1432192847,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2
true,JaiBhambra,flair5,,"I wouldn't say so. Our only opportunities came from set pieces, weird for us. But the first half I was just watching the screen in pure admiration of Man City, they are absolutely glorious to watch. Even with the 10 men in the first half, City just ripped us to shreds. If it weren't for the post, a great save from Lloris, it would've been game over. 

I'm sorry if I sound pessimistic, but the penalty not being given wouldn't have really changed the outcome that much. We probably would've played the same system had Rose stayed on, or maybe bringing Soldado on for someone (Sigurdsson most likely, with Eriksen going to the left). That would've just opened up more space in the midfield for City to play through, and it would've been something necessary to chase the game. 

By chasing the game you end up creating problems for yourself because you're so occupied with attacking. This is pretty much what happened at the Etihad. With the Lloris fuck up early on, we over compensated and pushed further forward than what we should have; really because we had no choice. Also, don't forget about the personnel involved, Jan got absolutely destroyed by Navas in the away game. Rose had more defensive cover from Siggy and the pace to keep up. 

I'm sorry, but I'm writing as I think so there's not much cohesion. Just think about how involved our wingers/Eriksen/Ade were in the first half. Don't remember Lennon touching the ball, Sigurdsson didn't keep the ball that well, Eriksen's touch was heavy and Ade was isolated. In my comment history I wrote about Siggy and his defensive work when compared to Lennon in this game. But needless to say, it didn't look like any were going to do anything amazing that game. When you don't have possession for long periods you tend to get frustrated and this showed quite a bit with our front 4. 

Also, Aguero/Yaya got injured this game and Negredo didn't play. Can't stress enough how much Aguero would've abused the pace of Dawson and positioning of Vlad. Had these 3 played the full 90 I fear the score may have been a lot worse; even if we had 11 players. 

TL;DR (didn't make sense) All in all, both games weren't competitive. AVB chased the game too hard from the early goal, the attacking intent left major gaps in our midfield which City gracefully waltzed through. 

Sherwood picked the wrong formation imo, Capoue should've started. In regards to Ferdinand's statement, do you expect Bentaleb to be competent &amp; confident enough to hold against City when Dembele has gone forward? I don't think so. But we were outclassed. Sad times.  :(

true,LordMugwort,flair6,,"Destroying is a little strong for Sherwood i think. I'm sure he's doing the best he can it's just his best isn't good enough for what we as Spurs fans should be demanding. It's laughable that the best we could do to replace a young coach with little experience is a young coach with no experience whatsoever. It shows no foresight or planning at all.

No my problems with what i see as our club being poorly run are aimed a little higher than Sherwood. Take our transfer policy for example. Doesn't it strike you as a little bit of a scattergun approach? Look at Soldado. He was brought in to be our lone striker. A role he's unsuited for. I love Bobby and i hope he comes good but we could have spent less/similar on somone who IS suited to that role. Poor scouting.

Lamela? Seems to me that the reason he's here is because Baldini knew he could get him. He looks like a fan appeasement buy to compensate us for selling our best player yet again. That 30 million could have been spent in an area that we did need upgrading. LB anyone? Yep. I don't care if Rose wants to be first choice. We need a better left back and if it hurts his feelings then i'm sure he'll work out what he'll do for himself. Dawson? How long are we going to persevere with the idea that he's a top 4 quality CB? The champions league isn't exactly screaming out for the presence of a Mr M. Dawson in its ranks. Upgrade needed. Dont get me wrong here we have signed some good players (Lloris, Superjan, Eriksen) but they won't be here long if this club keeps claiming to be ambitious and aiming high on one hand yet continues to demonstrate a distinct lack of what it takes to get there.

Did you know that we have spent around MINUS 35 million pounds over the last three seasons? Take a look at the other successful teams around. What do they do? Spend. I wouldn't expect us to keep up with the monied/oil rich teams (Though our owner is a multibillionaire by the way) but i would expect a club of our size to have more outgoing than incoming. Where is that money? New stadium? That was Levys number 1 job when he came through the door and it's still not done. 

I've often felt like posting a thread on here recently outlining how i feel about our beloved club is being run but didn't want to be seen as some ranting reactionary in light of some of the abysmal results we've had this season. I'm warming up to it now though.

Something is starting to smell rotten at our club. And i don't like it one little bit. ",0,1391190237,null,0,1391190746,0,cf3pv67,t3_1wn9pf,t1_cf3pv67,t1_cf3m86s,null,1432192907,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Some people find the thought of gay-marriage to be deeply offensive.  Suppose they told anyone who supported gay-marriage that 'words have consequences, so be careful what you say'.  Suppose they organized boycotts of any organization employing supporters of gay marriage, successfully lobbying to get presenters thrown off the air and pro gay-marriage newspapers banned from campuses.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I could go on forever about epistemology and ontology but I'd be bored and you'd want to kill yourself. So I'll give you this much. 

First - if it REALLY floats your boat and you want to know how social science epistemology and ontology works - look up Alan Bryman and his various textbooks on the matter. 

Now....

If I was being a realist I would point out that the majority of people who get paid , usually by govs and large corporations, don't do straight logical positivism when it comes to social science. 

In hard science it works because it is the dominant rational model and that's hard science for you. It's no surprise that you get a boat load of STEM people suddenly faced with complex phenomena like a whole chuffing society they then want to wheel out a ruler and set of scales to make sense of it.  

In SS , it died a death in the 1970s because it just couldn't cope with social phenomena and come up with decent enough models to explain things. You can look up attempts such as the advent of Taylorism in business and work relations that demonstrate how totally useless it became.

The closest we come to it are realists and even they're limited to things like economics,even then they'd call themselves critical realists rather than just straight out realists. Critical realists admit that there are multiple contexts and interpretation that lead to an underlying reality - but keep the logical positivist assertion that you have a reality to identify. 

So we're not talking about hip or cool, we're talking about hard reportage delivered on the back end of a ESCR grants and influential everywhere from the way you get interviewed at work to the way they organise shop fronts when you walk into a store. 


BTW the link you posted is for Post Modernists - and post-modernism isn't anywhere close to popular as an ontology in SS- unless you're French.

and also the link isn't actual social science. It's LITERARY CRITICISM. There's a huge difference. Now post-modernism and literary criticism have a very interesting history and they have quite a few very mind bending things to say - but they're in the realm of pure philosophy. They aren't social science. 

and let's get back to this: 

&gt;You simply insinuated that everybody who doesn't agree with you has confirmation bias.

Again you're really pushing this way too hard. I didn't insinuate anything. I stated people who knew very little about the Muslim community would be stating their opinions with very little knowledge of it and working off their confirmation bias. 

Which is pretty evident from some of the comments, and especially your reaction. 

People want to use the case of Maajid and his tweet as a way of expressing what they see as the underlying reality of the situation. They don't have the information on Muslims at hand so they filter it through what they do know - which is the media and whatever else. 

P.S ... and ... please don't tell people you ""tried to reason with them"" and then wheel out ontology.. someone might actually know what to say in response. ",0,1391191372,null,0,1391191598,0,cf3qe17,t3_1wkaph,t1_cf3qe17,t1_cf3pfjr,null,1432193157,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If people are concerned about offending others, that is called 'being a functional human being who doesn't want to make anyone else uncomfortable'. Besides, I find people even more open online, just look at Reddit. No one is saying you aren't allowed to say things, but if you're going to act like an offensive asshole you're going to have to deal with being treated like one.

&gt;Would you defend their actions on the ground that it's all perfectly legal, or would you think that perhaps they were going against the spirit of free-speech?

I would say that they are actually taking into account the spirit of freedom of speech, and I would try to join counter protests. Boycotts, lobbying etc are all fine usages of freedom of speech.

In that case, I don't really think the comparison helps. While the ECHR deals with many issues that a codified constitution would, it isn't a sovereign document, and it is only enforceable in our domestic courts due to the Human Rights Act 1998, which can be repealed or amended by a simple parliamentary majority. 

One of the main reasons that a codified constitution is thought to be able to restrict the government of the day is that it is entrenched, i.e. any changes to it require much broader support than any single party can ever practically call on. That simply isn't the case with the HRA, which weakens any guarantee of protections from the ECHR.  

That said, I don't agree either that the ECHR fails to protect us from government ""in even the slightest amount"". If it really didn't restrict governments, we wouldn't have people like Theresa May continually undermining it and suggesting that the HRA ought to be repealed. Of course, if the Conservatives had a majority, then they could do much more than merely rail against the Act, but that's where entrenchment comes in. That is, essentially, the value of a codified constitution.  

I'll admit, though, that I do agree with you about the questions of who writes a constitution and what goes into it. It could only be of worth if it reflected genuinely shared values - not merely the values of the incumbent government - and in any case it could only be enforced if the courts accepted the right of the government that passed it to kill the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy stone dead. If they didn't, then any subsequent parliament could just repeal the Act that passed the constitution with a simple majority.  

On balance, having seen how the US Constitution has effectively turned centuries-old values into facets of their national identity, I'd really rather we left it well alone.

Maybe you're fine with people behaving like that, but I think it's a dangerous attitude to have and the fact that it's perfectly legal to attempt to shut down other people doesn't make it morally right.

*'With all due respect to one of comments below (paulburton1991),you have it all wrong. When Cellino took over Cagliari the stadium capacity was around 40,000 seats, and it was almost always sold out. He also took over a very strong team with some elite players. Cagliari was not a very small team, they had won serie a few years earlier but had fallen due to financial problems. But before Cellino arrived they had recovered, and in 1994 they made it to the semifinals in the uefa cup. So he inherited a healthy club.*

*The stadium is now 5,000 seats because he never did what he was supposed to do: pay rent (helped by the mayor, whom he is best buddies with) and provide maintainace work. Not only that, he transformed the team in his only business, which he ran with the mental attitude of a mad man. The stadium is in those conditions because of him, and he has been milking the club to these days, in which he makes sure they don't get relegated, to receive sky money, but that they also don't make it into Europe , so that he doesn't have to do anything else but manage and get profits from a mid table club. As a lifetime fan of Cagliari , I can tell you that besides the average ignorant fan who supports this psycho in anything he does, most of us are frustrated as hell. I hope he leaves to England ASAP, but I wouldn't wish Cellino on my worst enemy.'*

Look, if the guy comes in, sacks McDermott, then continues building the club to one that can legitimately challenge for the premiership, then fine, I'll get behind him then. But if he comes in, sacks McDermott, and then brings in coach after coach in some desperate attempt to find a quick-fix way to promotion, all the while selling the talented players we possess (which he has done throughout his time at Cagliari) then I will continue to stand against his ownership of the club.

It sounds like that the Dnipro owner is unwilling to sell. This isn't some cheap ploy to drive his price up, but they genuinely want to keep hold of him. Compounding problems is that our offer seems to be based on instalments, like most transfers, and the fulfillment of certain conditions. Ie. CL qualification, appearances etc. This is unattractive to Dnipro who would like a substantial portion of the fee upfront. 

It sounds like Konoplyanka has agreed personal terms and it is a disagreement over the (EDIT: paying of the) fee that is holding things up. The player sounds like he wants to come but he apparently has a good working relationship with the Dnipro owner and is unwilling to hand in a transfer request or force a move.

You aren't listening. A&amp;E chose to kick him off the air because they didn't want to be associated with a homophobe.

&gt;Imagine if someone went into a bookshop and complained that because he didn't like one of the books that perhaps the bookstore should stop selling the book so that nobody else can read it. 

If enough people protest the book that may be reason enough for the bookstore to stop, but ultimately the decision is up to them.

&gt;Maybe you're fine with people behaving like that, but I think it's a dangerous attitude to have and the fact that it's perfectly legal to attempt to shut down other people doesn't make it morally right. 

What you don't seem to grasp is that freedom of speech goes both ways. If I don't like what you're saying, I'm allowed to argue against you.

&gt;Don't like a cartoon or a book? Don't read it. Don't like a TV program? Don't watch it. Or you could try to write your own book, cartoon or TV show. But no, you don't have a moral right to tell other people what they can or can't enjoy.

That's fine, but yes I do have a moral right to tell people what they can and can't enjoy, because that's called freedom of speech. Don't like what I'm saying? Argue against me.

On its own it is meaningless when we consider that some of these might be false. We have no way of knowing if they were or if the police threw them under the bus.

The conviction rate (number of convictions per prosecutions reaching court) [is apparently 58%](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7442785/Rape-conviction-rate-figures-misleading.html) which would make it about average.

There are probably some more up to date numbers around but I'm not spending my evening finding them.

There is an argument that the much publicized 6% conviction rate figure puts a lot of women off of reporting rape because they believe they have no chance of winning the case.

true,nberms,lfc12,,"Great post, man. I think everything you said is spot on.

What's so great about this pressing system is that it allows us to counter so well. Having Sturridge/Suarez drop into the midfield allows us to have a numbers advantage in midfield like you said - this not only allows us to suffocate their midfield, but it gives us passing options once we force a turnover. Because we have the man advantage in that area of the park, we will be able to quickly make 1-3 passes and find the free man who can push the counter. Sometimes it was Coutinho, other times Sturridge.

Having two players as dangerous and attention-commanding as Suarez and as pacy as Sterling really makes this work. We can drop one of our forwards, Sturridge, into midfield and yet still be extremely dangerous because of the quality of the two players up top.

The variety is also great - creativity is just as important off-ball as it is on it. I do think that we seem to get our chances when Suarez is in the middle and Sterling right and Sturridge left though.

The Brazilian Box is a fantastic point. Coutinho is deceptive and quick and it allows him to distribute in unpredictable ways. It may be an unconscious thing that they are setting up in the box, but who knows. I think this game showed why we need Couts in the middle. The Imgur stills showed the plethora of options available to him - SASS making great runs, Hendo running forward, Gerrard or a fullback in support. Coutinho is best when he's the link between Gerrard and the attack.

I think something that is really underrated is how important Hendo's runs are. His stamina and desire allows him to make these long bombing runs, and often I see his run taking him up to the top of the line. He usually doesn't get the ball as a result of these, but what it does is draw a defender or two or at least make them pay attention to him. This frees up space for the others, and his runs are just as important as any.

All in all, I think we found a great balance in the squad and tactics vs. Everton. There was great chemistry in the press and attack between SASS, Couts, Hendo, and Gerrard. Flanno and Cissokho didn't need to be too involved, which is good. The only thing that worried me a bit was that Everton was able to find passes through the seams a bit too easy. I think with Sakho and Enrique back that will help clean that up.",0,1391197506,null,0,false,0,cf3taui,t3_1wnxpb,t1_cf3taui,t3_1wnxpb,null,1432194517,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The route I take seems fairly safe. There's a cycle lane most of the way I go, and aside from buses constantly pulling into it and seemingly random disappearances of it I've never really had any trouble. Parts of it get filled up with leaves in Autumn because the council is too lazy to sweep.

&gt;• What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as?

Fairly casual on-road, I cycle to and from University on a semi-regular basis if the weather isn't too bad. I'm far more into offroad trail riding so my bike isn't really set up for road riding.

Have you ever been on anti depressants? Because I have, and the range of side effects from ending your prescribed amount early is quite vast.

* No selfies(OF ANY KIND unless they go with the days theme; ie Red Head Mondays, Firearm Fridays etc)
* No MLP

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

In the city I feel pretty safe. I'm fortunate that I can keep up with cars for the most part, and norwich is quite sleepy compared to say London..
That said, my wife cycles, but is no where near as confident as me, and I worry about her a lot.

&gt;what kind of cyclist am I...

Pretty/very dedicated. I'm an advocate of things like livable cities, and see great benefits of cycling.

I commute daily, get annoyed when I have to use the car (for commuting), and partake In long (50-100-200 mile) rides regularly too. I would happy describe myself as a keen cyclist.

&gt;what facilities are available...

Hmmm, tricky.

On my morning commute there are no facilities. Around the city things like cycle paths I feel are nothing more than an after thought, or box ticking to appease someone (central government maybe?). For example, outside my office we have a cycle path that's about 8ft long. And where we do have a nice path it's on a 40mph stretch of road that cars use to park in. I cringe when I see cyclists trying to use it....police seem uninterested. 


In a side note that I'm not sure is relevant to your questions... 

While I think cycle paths are (potentially) great, I also see the benefit of lowering the speed limit of cars form the standard 30 to 20mph. It is my understanding that many cities are thinking and or implementing this.

So far Norwich is not that city, but I suspect as more cities do implement it my city will follow.

Its not too bad. If you cycle a lot then you learn the back roads, bike paths. Its not as safe as the past - more traffic. One thing Ive noticed is that there are more drivers on ratruns

• What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

Been most sort of cyclists, including racing, currently a commuter

• What facilities are available in your town or city for a new cyclist?

Based in Edinburgh - pretty good really. 


The problem with articles on cycling, especially commuting is that both sides of the argument are entrenched. The drivers complaining about red light jumping, the cyclists complaining about poor driving. Neither side is going to budge, but the truth is that the majority of drivers and cyclists are good, but you get idiots. The problem is an idiot in a car is going to kill a cyclist, an idiot on a bike is only going to scrape your paint

The policy, ""We will abolish political correctness from the police service in favour of real crime fighting,"" sounds like something no one could possibly argue with. The trouble with this is that my agreement with it is entirely reliant on the supposition that political correctness is actually getting in the way of policing. I happen to have no idea whether this is the case or not, which prevents me from making a proper judgement.  
In other words, it's a crapshoot. Looking up the policy reveals that it came from the BNP and with that in mind, many would agree that the assertion made becomes more suspect.  
That is why I gave up on it. Everything sounds good when taken at face value but we all know how empty and misleading these kind of promises can be, how bad things can be made to sound good and vice-versa.

&gt; • How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

Not very, but that's more of a result of the many blind corners than anything that can be affected by successive governments.

&gt; • What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

Commuter, plus the occasional trip into town.

&gt; • What facilities are available in your town or city for a new cyclist?

The police will regularly have events where you can just show up with your bike and have it GPS chipped for free to help prevent theft. There's some legally questionable bike lanes and only the main roads have them, so you have a choice between using main roads that are frequented by trucks, busses and vans, or using back-roads where there are none, so some people see your use of them as an excuse to declare open season on you.

7)  Drugs used in medicine are routinely given what is called 
an LD-50.  The LD-50 rating indicates at what dosage fifty percent of 
test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced 
toxicity.  A number of researchers have attempted to determine 
marijuana's LD-50 rating in test animals, without success.  **Simply 
stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to 
induce death.**

8)  At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 is around 
1:20,000 or 1:40,000.  In layman terms this means that in order to induce 
death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as 
much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette.  NIDA-supplied 
marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams.  A smoker would 
theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within 
about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.

9)  In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal 
response as a result of drug-related toxicity.

&gt;better than getting it from pig ignorant racist family members 

There's nothing in what the article says or what I wrote that mentions any of those. In fact Kenan argues that it's racist to assume that there's a Voice of the Community - which is a both subtle point but there's other issues with it we won't go into and ultimately unrelated to your claim. 

But there is nothing that I said or he said really adds any structure to that response. 

That is what you posted. So these are your assumptions - that the families are inherently racist. 

Assumptions can work off two biases - availability and confirmation. I'm sure some serious Cog.Sci like my colleague John Maule could sort out the balance. 

&gt;and a book that's thousands of years old

Again, there's nothing in the article or what I said that even mentions scripture. Kenan is a social scientist, he did some research a while back on immigrant communities. Most of his article is written off the back of his experience and his research. 

I never said Kenan himself never knew what he was talking about, though it's arguable whether he's part of the community. In fact when challenged on the BBC TV programme Daily Politics he emphatically stated he wasn't Muslim.

In America the various political groups also send surveys to candidates, so you can look up people's ""pro gun score"" and ""pro choice score"".

• How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

Quite safe, but only because I'm experienced and confident of my ability to mix with larger vehicles.  I've been cycling regularly for almost 25 years so I don't know if that confidence has grown.

• What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

Serious hobby.  I am unable to commute to work by bicycle so all my cycling is for pleasure only.

• What facilities are available in your town or city for a new cyclist?

A few stands here and there but otherwise, fuck all.  What cycle lanes exist are pathetic in their implementation, being either dangerous to use or completely impractical, so I do not use them.

But your piece might be better served by asking why people who want to cycle (there are lots) won't.  The answer, of course, is the lack of decent cycling infrastructure, like Denmark or the Netherlands possess.

All you really have to consider is this.  If you had a 7-8 year old child, would you feel safe letting them cycle on their own, to school, on a typical urban highway?",0,1391206674,null,0,false,0,cf3xozf,t3_1wnlqa,t1_cf3xozf,t3_1wnlqa,null,1432196839,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We also need to spend more efficiently and get value from what taxes are spent on and reduce the welfare bill.

Some taxes should be cut, others increased, and some things should be de-privatised (prisons for example really should not be privatised and it doesnt really save money).

We were defensive this season, for two reasons I think. Firstly we need to be more organised defensively, we've thrown so many games away because we were not defensively well organised. I love attacking football as much as anyone but you need to be solid at the back.

Secondly, we had 7 new players to integrate. I think that was a mistake in hindsight but I expected some of them to hit the ground running a bit faster. With that in mind the smart thing to do is to keep everyone organised and getting the basics right while the players adjusted. Essentially we were buying ourselves time.

Chadli was amazing in the first two games, willing to take players on and could actually get a ball into the box, unlike the media's golden boy, Townsend, who for all the pace and desire was seemingly incapable of a final product.",0,1391209349,null,0,false,0,cf3ywep,t3_1wn1nr,t1_cf3ywep,t1_cf3r76o,null,1435508399,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;This article is about 24 houses on one street. Theres probably no more than a thousand in the whole country (despite what the Guardian says London consists of more than a 3 central boroughs and they certainly aren't full of absentee Russian/Arab oligarchs).

HMRC estimate that [More than two million foreign investors own UK property](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/10515877/Foreign-buyers-of-British-homes-up-by-40pc.html), so it's actually a huge problem.

&gt;How do we ensure that these houses aren't lived in? What's to stop the owner claiming that they (or a friend) stay for a week or two every year as a holiday home? What's to stop them from paying someone a grand for spending a week there in order to avoid taxes of tens or hundreds of thousands?

Councils already determine how many people live in properties when deciding how much council tax to charge, you get a 25% single occupier discount and up to 50% off if no-one lives there. So they will have already thought of all of these things. There is a simpler solution though, which is simply to have a mansion tax on all houses worth over £2 million, whether lived in or not, which would discourage people leaving them empty as investment properties but for the richest people who actually wanted to use them would just be a minor annoyance.

Edit: In fact, the more I think about it, the bizarre these objections are. We have a tax system that tracks every penny of income a person earns, every VATable good and service sold, for the purpose of benefits the government tracks not only whether people are living together but what their relationship is. But you think it's beyond the realms of possibility for HMRC to see if someone is actually living in a house? You're grasping at straws.

&gt;It's hard to regulate, virtually impossible to enforce, and culturally creates a hostile environment for foreign wealth.

It's actually very simple as I've described above. People who buy properties in the UK as an investment and never actually come to the UK only push up house prices, they don't actually contribute anything to our economy or tax revenues, so I have no problem creating a culture that is hostile to that.",0,1391209993,null,0,1391210745,0,cf3z6fb,t3_1wnvtj,t1_cf3z6fb,t1_cf3yski,null,1432197566,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I would also argue that with such a high deficit the UK isn't really stable at all. Why not buy the same house in Germany a much more stable and economically successful country? 

The reason they buy here is because the price is much higher than elsewhere so they expect the unrealistic return that isn't coming.

Do you reckon Suarez is? I don't. Do you reckon he'll be if we finish outside of top4?

Something is wrong with how Liverpool handles transfers. Not paying over the odds is one thing, throwing money out the window is another - finding the middle road seems to be an issue for the transfer committe, or Ayre, or whoever's doing the negotiations.

Yes, right.  But in that same vein, governments have been tapping phones and spying on people in every available technology since electronic communications first began.

The problem with the prescribed reddit view is that everything is a slippery slope to a New World Order where an international syndicate of oligarchs hell bent on our suppression is attempting to overthrow the global society and enslave us purely to make a few more bucks.  When in fact this kind of thing has been going on long before Snowden and Assange appeared on the scene.  And ordinary members of the public have gone about their lives with little to fear during all of that time.

The point being, reddit prefers to believe that if someone stores your Skype call on a hard disk in a bunker somewhere, that inevitably means one day we're all going to have our thoughts controlled and thrown into North Korean style labour camps if we don't comply.

I don't think we will be able to keep Curtois which is a shame since he very well can go on to become the best in the world. He won't want to play second fiddle to a club legend like Cech and should be sold for a nice little fee. Cech will be 35 in 4 years which is still young for GK and should be able to continue at a high level.

As for our midfield I think Hazard will be one of the best in the world in a few years and will get sold to Madrid for more than the GDP of a small country. Oscar may still be around but I could see him being off to Barca and Willian will be sold to one half of Milan or another. Griezmann and Kroos is just speculation on my part but would be great additions. A lot of you are forgetting about Traore who I think will play a big part in the future.

The striker situation will be most up in the air. I honestly think whoever is our starting striker in 4 years isn't on the radar at the moment. It could be Costa or even Lukaku but I feel like Lukaku still has a lot to prove.

It's just so frustrating how many times we seem to fail spectacularly in the transfer market. This summer, this winter, I'm glad we're not paying massive costs for poor players anymore but signing noone is really not satisfying. 

And it's not just not signing anyone, if lfc had announced from the beginning they never wanted to sign anyone and never did, I'd probably be a bit unhappy, since I think we need players, but it wouldn't be as bad as this. We seem to have target after target, move after move, just fail time and time again. This just sounds like a farce to me, some melodramatic novel plot line. 

How, after so many public failings, could we wait literally up until the final minute, trying to push something through, just to fail again. Are we even really trying? I get not everything works out how you want it to, but this is the same story over and over again.

Your first paragraph doesn't really say anything apart from that I'm a liar (nope) and that I have a lot of time on my hands (nope, quick at typing). Not really much reason to not be polite in any case, but moving on to more interesting things.

&gt; Opinion polling has too high a potential for inaccuracy to be cited as part of any argument which respects logical method. This is well-recognised by the public (according to this poll), and although polls retain propaganda value for Governments I'm still going to dismiss this argument straight away.

I said “he's right according to the polls”. None of what you've said disproves that, you've just explained why polls are unreliable. I agree, polls are notoriously crap,  but you haven't disproved anything here. And I hope you aren't pretending groups with an anti-government bias don't also use polls for their propaganda.

&gt; Where does one even begin to unpack this? How are you defining his job, what standards are there for improvement, how are you defining his crediting and how can any of this be relevantly juxtaposed with a previous Government? Mr. Cameron is the current Prime Minister and any problems brought by the commons are ultimately laid at his feet, not those of the Labour party. To argue that he isn't responsible for the political structure of this country is to fail to understand exactly what the Prime Minister does.

This is a good point, I didn't develop my point enough. I don't have time to write a full defence of the coalition unfortunately. However I believe the Prime Minister is responsible for dealing with the political problems of the country, but that doesn't preclude Labour's responsibility in causing or at least exacerbating those problems preceding Cameron's leadership. I'm not arguing he isn't responsible for dealing with them. 

&gt; Sure, sometimes people are very reductionist when it comes to talking about politics. Their arguments are structured by idioms that occasionally sacrifice declarative language for emotive language and we might see this in their use of the word Government. But you are talking as if Her Majesty's Government doesn't exist, as if references to it do not refer to anything discrete. This is ridiculous. Let me be explicit: the Government is the executive power under which we live. That the system of effecting this power often internally disputes the power to be effected is irrelevant. The Government's only function is to execute power. It is its result that affects us, and it is that which people are reacting to. Your weird little lesson in Democracy bears no relation to our current means of determining Government, which comes every five years.

I am well aware of what the government is and how many years we have between general elections, but thank you for the reminder. My issue is not with the term itself, I of course acknowledge that the the term is usually appropriate. My issue was with the allocation of criticism, not what the government consists of.  

&gt; I cannot find a single example of that phrase being said. It's an obvious straw man. But, unintentionally, you've made quite an accurate point. Executive power is a matter of control. The last section of your argument is a large straw man sort of “circle jerk” argument, in which you're stumbling towards positing that discourse on reddit suffers from a positive feedback loop that occurs because the same arguments get reinforced within this self-contained space. I'm running out of time to respond, but, yeah. Sure. That is a phenomena which often occurs on internet forums, which Reddit is. Prove that it's happening here, though. I want documentation, or otherwise I could make the exact same argument about you. By which I mean to show you the weakness of that argument. 

No, I was using it as a euphemism for many separate arguments I have seen from all over this subreddit over time. If it was a direct quote, I would have referenced where it came from.  I'm running out of patience, but [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/search?q=NSA&amp;restrict_sr=on) is a link to any article with the phrase “NSA” in it.

true,andyjonesx,english,Worcester,"It's hard to argue against something when you can only guess. If someone were to say, 10 years ago, that every email, website, conversation, literally everything you do online is stored by the government, don't you think people would be telling them to take their tin-foil hat off? Yet now you talk as if we all knew it was going on. Maybe some people had their guesses, but nothing was in stone.

Your next point... about things stored will never be listened to. You're completely right, 99.999% of the time. It's the 0.001% of the time that is completely unacceptable. It's the 0.001% that can control the nation.

I think you'd have to be extremely naive to say that if you became a 'problem', whether politically, or through protests or journalism, that they wouldn't start to open up your file and see what they can do... I mean, there is already proof that that has happened (it was discussed about using a Muslim clerics pornography habits to discredit him).

If you take that to the bigger scale, they can stop almost anybody some way or another. Even if you have nothing to hide, what if they show you they can have many members of your family arrested for tax evasion, or some other thing that they can find out. A lot of people may be willing to comply then.

Maybe even worse, what if they start to lie? What can you do? We now know they have everything on us. If the government released something saying you downloaded child pornography, who are people going to believe?
