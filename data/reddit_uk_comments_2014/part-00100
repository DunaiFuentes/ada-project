&gt;

&gt;A __croissant__ (^i/krəˈsɑːnt/ or /ˈkwʌsɒŋ/; French pronunciation: [kʁwa.sɑ̃] ) is a [buttery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter) flaky [viennoiserie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennoiserie) pastry named for its well known [crescent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent) shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered [yeast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_yeast)-leavened [dough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dough). The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a [puff pastry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puff_pastry).

&gt;Crescent-shaped food breads have been made since the Middle Ages, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. 

&gt;Croissants have long been a staple of French bakeries and [pâtisseries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A2tisserie). In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, [frozen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food), pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a [fast food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food) which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissanterie was explicitly a French response to American-style fast food,  and today 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries are frozen.  Today, the croissant remains popular in a [continental breakfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_breakfast).

I know it's an odd and possibly flimsy example, but there's a relatively recent documentary on a working-class area of Coleraine called [The Estate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQXWLkpP0VI0) that features a mother who didn't really care about whether her daughter went to school or not, and feeling like there was no point in getting a job. There are many, many cases of this, again speaking anecdotally even regarding parts of my own wider family. How can we encourage these attitudes to change without overstepping boundaries and going inside people's homes? That's not something I'd ever want to condone, so I'd love to figure out something.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Oh, god, **everyone** covers the Fringe. UK national papers like the Guardian and the Financial Times, Scottish nationals The Herald and The Scotsman, plus countless Fringe-specific publications. The biggest are ThreeWeeks, Broadway Baby and Fest. 

You might want to look at taking out online adverts on sites like www.edinburghspotlight.com and All Edinburgh Theatre (www.thomdibdin.com). They both carry theatre reviews and attract a lot of traffic during the Fringe. 

TV's not all that important (no-one is at home to watch it) but it's worth checking out online channels like www.summerhall.tv. In terms of radio, the biggest goal is to get onto Janice Forsyth's Culture Studio on BBC Scotland. There are also local stations like Castle FM, Black Diamond and Fresh Air, but I'm not convinced that they generate many ticket sales during August. 

The best publicity is a set of good reviews, acquired early - but unfortunately that's hard to control. Even if you've got an amazing show, it'll do you no good if you don't get reviewed until Week 3. Some publications allocate their reviews randomly, so you have no control at all, but others allow their reviewers a bit of freedom so if they pick up on any buzz about your show, they might prioritise it. If your venue holds a Press Launch, try to get yourself on the bill. If you can't, is there a part of your show that would make for eye-catching walkabout on the Royal Mile? You can also try for slots on the Royal Mile mini-stages. 

There'll be a Meet the Media event in the first few days of the Fringe - brave the queues and go to it. Hang around Fringe Central, learn to spot press lanyards (the colour changes from year to year, but if you ask the press office to show you one, they usually will). Talk to other performers. Give out lots of papering comps in your first few days - if the show is good, they'll repay you several time over by word of mouth. **Nothing** is more important in the first few days than good word of mouth. Buzz is paramount. 

Mind if I ask what your show is? PM me if you don't want to out yourself on Reddit. :-)

Taking away all foreign born people (assuming EU laws would be changed, and basic income wouldn't count as a benefit) the total figure comes to around £288 billion to provide a basic income of £7000 to all British adults living in the UK.

As a result I love how the parks here are the centre of the suburbs/towns and aren't over run by 15 yr olds drinking cider but instead are full of people from all ages out enjoying it. The fact on a Sunday New Farm park is rammed with people having picnics with big groups of their friends is great.

 I love that while Australia is super regulated that when you submit government paperwork it works. 20 minutes in person to get my driving license.  Yes i brought a ream of documents with me but I walked out of the office with a license in my hand after 20 mins. Likewise with my visa and getting my partner included in it. Reams of paperwork but it worked and then they offer her full employment rights with it which is great.

I love my commute to work on my bike. Easily the prettiest and most enjoyable I've had. 30mins of either quite roads or dedicated footpaths and I am in the office. But along the way I've cycled over the story bridge, cycled along the river, gone under the cliffs, gone through parks, along boardwalks. 

I really enjoy 4x4 and the camping here. Been to so many different places just within a 2hr drive of here . From Islands, costal area, rain forest, scrub /bush, beaches, mountainous (for Australia). Really varied and I can take the truck there. Chill out, fish, have a beer and everyone is out and about as well.

Edit
The food here as well is fantastic. So much of it relatively local and there are so many options to get good quality stuff here. So for my day to day shopping the quality is fantastic.

Not VAT on stuff you buy online from overseas up until 1,000 dollars. Of course you have to. Uh it from overseas because it's not here

Things I don't like: books here are like twice the price for no other reason exception for protectisim, dogs are to be kept on leads everywhere except designated dog fenced area and never In national parks, house prices are through the roof. Brisbane seems to think it is london in thta regard and rental agents here are really rubbish.  The internet here is really slow and expensive. 100dollars a month gets me 6 mb/sec . Great.

The NHS is one of the best things about the UK and every major political party knows (or at least has to accept thats what the rest of the country thinks) any attempt to do anything about that in any serious way is complete and total political suicide.

Simply put sometimes the NHS can't do everything and there is a place for private companies, and sometimes the NHS benefits from private sector input and expertise. The NHS has a finite budget and outsourcing certain aspects of certain services is a necessary and sensible idea. 

Get back to me when they start actively putting every hospital up for sale to the highest bidder, until then stop creating things to worry about. This idea people trot out about how the conservatives or whoever are going to be able to slowly privatise the whole thing without anyone noticing and we're going to wake up tomorrow with the American system is completely ludicrous.

For the people of N.I., that'd be Stormont. Then Westminster.

The solution is indeed self-determination with the current model of devolution proving to be successful enough so far.

Ultimately, it's up to the people of N.I. to decide. I'm not sure on the international law side of things, especially if you use the Crimea analogy.

The options would be more likely what we see in the Scottish referendum at the moment. Status quo or independence. Whether the Republic of Ireland would want to unify with the North is also another matter. There are so many more considerations to unifying with another country over becoming independent. So many more.

Like others had said, if the consensus was there, it'd bubble up over time. Fact is, an awful lot of N.I. are seemingly for the status quo.

Carroll and Downing are players. 

A player is not a manager. 

Most clubs plan on spending tens of millions on players. They prepare for the inevitability that not all of them will be good. 

Very, very few clubs spend tens of millions to buy managers out of their contracts at other clubs and then spend more millions to cancel those contracts. 

Most clubs can't afford to have 5 big name managers in 3 years, especially considering 3 or 4 of those had their contracts prematurely cancelled. 

Not at all comparable to buying and selling players.

&gt; And what does that have to do with your point about Chelsea signing players only for the explicit purpose of removing them from the market? If that is not the only explicit purpose, then how do teams sign players without removing their ability to play for rival teams?

I never claimed they signed players to remove them from the market (which is the consequence of signing players!) but that they signed players with the sole intention of stopping their rivals buying them first. Chelsea wouldn't bat an eyelid if Barcelona or Juventus wanted a player because they aren't in direct competition, but they would if Liverpool or Spurs did.

It doesn't. My point has nothing to do with net spend.

&gt;Carroll and Downing are players.

&gt;A player is not a manager.

I am aware of this. 

&gt;Most clubs plan on spending tens of millions on players. They prepare for the inevitability that not all of them will be good.

Much more clubs do not spend tens of millions on players. Very many much more. 

&gt;Very, very few clubs spend tens of millions to buy managers out of their contracts at other clubs and then spend more millions to cancel those contracts

The amount clubs spend on managers is almost miniscule compared to the amount they spend on players. 

&gt;Most clubs can't afford to have 5 big name managers in 3 years, especially considering 3 or 4 of those had their contracts prematurely cancelled.

The same clubs that cannot afford to do this also cannot afford to spend tens of millions on players. 

&gt;Not at all comparable to buying and selling players

Your point was that they spend money doing something that would bankrupt many clubs. My point is that the amount they spend on managers is a footnote compared to the amounts that many top clubs spend on players, which is also something that would bankrupt many clubs. 

I cannot think of a single club that could afford to spend tens of millions on players, and yet not afford to spend a fraction of that on managers. 

&gt;LFC got £15.5m when we sold Carroll

Making it close to a £20m loss on a player that scored only 11 goals. Not many clubs could afford that. 

I come back to your initial point:

&gt;Carroll and Downing were purchased after selling Torres for £50m.

Not many clubs sell a player for £50m. 

Now, to stop being pedantic, since you're not exactly clear at all in the things you're saying, I gather that you mean to say spending money on players is morally acceptable, but spending money on managers is morally wrong. 

Is there anything that supports the idea that spending money on managers is morally wrong? After all, managers control and train the players. Surely it's important to spend some money on a good manager that is going to rule all those expensive players, yes?",0,1396994875,null,0,false,0,cgnjs9h,t3_22ja9y,t1_cgnjs9h,t1_cgnj8oc,null,1433269744,-4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-4

But Migs seems to me like someone with a ceiling that might not be as high as our ceiling.

Here's how I would put it. If we keep improving, there could be a moment in the next 3-4 years where a young keeper comes through whose British and we can put in a bid for him to be a star for years to come. Or a top prospect could emerge from broader Europe who could cement us as a top CL competing side.

Right now I think you have to look at the other top clubs around the globe and ask yourself if Migs is amongst the best goalies in the world. Is he top 10? Probably not. Is he top 20? I couldn't really say.

But when you're attempting to cement yourself at the upper crust, you need someone whose is pretty close to being cemented there at keeper. I think Migs is great and will be great for us for the immediate future and likely improve here and there. But I wouldn't say he's a player I look at and think, ""Oh yeah, barring a bid from elsewhere, he'll be here for at least 5 more years"". At goalie, it's realistic to look at them that way. They don't move around as much as outfield players.

Tickets are pretty cheap, like £2 for a day return, and you can get a season ticket which is really reasonable - like £35 a month.

I did the opposite for a year. I was living in Selly Oak (the are UoB students primarily inhabit) while on my placement year whilst working in Birmingham city centre. The trains rarely let me down, but with bad rain came delays and sometimes cancellations. There were sometimes annoying 5/10 min delays just because. The trains are often busy during rush hour as they serve big suburban areas as well as the university. I have friends who lived on the edge of the city centre in UoB off campus accommodation that was still a train ride away. They said it wasn't too big a deal, but definitely put them off going to uni some days, and sometimes the trains were a bit all over the place.

There are busses too, but they can take upwards of 45 mins as they do take the long way around.

All in all, it's not the best option to live in the city centre. Also you don't wanna miss out on Selly Oak. It's a really unique place and there isn't anywhere else in Birmingham like it. The student population means it's a pretty active little place and there is a really cool vibe there.

true,Andures,null,null,"&gt;So it's simply coincidence that Chelsea have signed players that other teams have actively pursued first? You're right, the media doesn't report everything, but most transfer news sources at least mention it as a possibility before it happens, especially if it's a team as big as Chelsea.

Incidentally, both Willian and Salah had been linked with Chelsea seasons before. Simply because Chelsea, by their nature, is linked with almost any promising player in the world by any number of random transfer rumour generators (see: tabloids and shit websites). 

&gt;they signed players with the sole intention of stopping their rivals buying them first

This would imply that they do not have the intention to actually play these players. 

&gt;Chelsea wouldn't bat an eyelid if Barcelona or Juventus wanted a player because they aren't in direct competition, but they would if Liverpool or Spurs did.

Pure conjecture. 

The fact is that transfers are complex, and trying to ascertain only one single reason, especially one as conspiratorial as yours, for transfers happening is an oversimplification of things. 

Clubs can and will monitor multiple players at one time. Oftentimes, many clubs are monitoring the same player. Let's take Salah, for example. Chelsea could have been content with Salah continuing his development at Basel for another season or two, but when Liverpool came into the picture, it would have taken Salah off the market for Chelsea, which would motivate Chelsea to make a move. Maybe Chelsea would not have made the move had it not been Liverpool but a club from another country, but that would also have been under the consideration that a foreign club would be more likely than Liverpool to sell Salah to Chelsea in the future. (see: Suarez and Arsenal saga)

The result is that Chelsea gets a good player, while preventing Liverpool from getting one. 

&gt;Of course, there is no substantial proof and only my opinion on it, but it seems a highly dubious that you would sign any player having a medical with another club without mentioning it at all first.

But Chelsea did mention it. The widely accepted rumour is that Roman mentioned it to Anzhi's owner, and used his relationship to secure the deal. Notice that Chelsea had previously been attempting to sign Rooney, so signing Willian was easily a case of going to their backup because their main target seemed unlikely. 

You see, when one club is publicly in for a player, it means that this player is currently on the market. This alerts any other clubs that might have interest in the deal, and gives them the chance to also come in with their own deal. When the club involved is one from another country, in particular one that is considered lower in prestige, then the 'hijacking' club would have less impetus to make a move, as they might be more confident of securing a future move. However, if the initial club is one that considers itself a rival to the 'hijacking' club, then the opportunity to sign the player could potentially be lost forever. 

Let me give you a hypothetical scenario. Manchester United has, for most of this season, been linked with a move for William Carvalho in the summer, with United fans parroting something about their scouts having gone to see the lad 12 times. If, in the summer, it became public that United were negotiating a 8 million deal with Carvalho (the figure is an arbitrary sum and should not be taken seriously), and Liverpool jumped in to snatch the kid up for 10 million, would it be considered disgusting to you? 

Your entire perception is coloured by your club loyalties. Chelsea tries to incorporate every one of their senior signings into the first team, and I cannot think of any player that might have been a first-team target for their rivals, who was bought and left unused on purpose.

The economy will self regulate to keep the vast majority of people in work. In the long term old industries will automate and lay off workers at the same rate as new industries hire workers.

&gt;How much do you know about the SAS?

&gt;Not much really. 

&gt;Well, the SAS was originally founded to be a crack, secret, elite, secret and crack assault force to work behind enemy lines during WW2. Now, our role has changed substantially since that time. Now we are here primarily to act as a masturbatory aid for various backbench MPs. 

&gt;I see!

&gt;Yes, I'm afraid so. You see, it seems a lot of today's parliamentarians are quite unable to achieve sexual gratification without fantasising about the SAS. So we have to go about the place being crack, secret and assaulting and secret and crack all the time and as elite as possible just so these people can keep their marriages intact.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;Yes, when you already have a striker (a number 9), you don't have a false 9. I'm not sure why that is so hard to understand.
What you have essentially described is a secondary striker. That is not a false 9. A false 9 is a system, not the position.

You don't seem to be able to understand tactics at all. There are three types of systems teams usually play with when they have two strikers up top. First one is the kind Milan used when they had Shevchenko and Crespo - two ""number 9s"" - with both drifting wide then dropping into holes. Second is when you have a center forward and a support striker - the system UTD used when they had Berbatov - where the support striker or false 9 drops behind the center forward; hence also known as a false 9 or a shadow striker or a support striker. Third is when you have two ball playing strikers who take turns to drop back into the hole. A false 9 is just another name for support striker. There is no such thing as a false 9 system. Its just the striker dropping back to support his wingers.

&gt; You didn't mention Tevez because he only played for two seasons. And yet, his first year was the year Ronaldo scored 31 goals. In fact, Ronaldo left the same year as Tevez.

You've brought in Tevez from nowhere and now you're bringing up irrelevant stats. I know he left at the end of the same season as Ronaldo. What does that have to do with anything? Ronaldo was the focal point of the system even before Tevez came in. They were playing the exact same formation that we are currently playing. They had a misfiring striker in Saha who was injured most of the time, which is why Rooney played as the lone striker in a false 9 in a 4-5-1. Let me also remind you that they played 4-5-1 a lot when they had Ronaldo. Just because Rooney was on the pitch along with another striker did not mean he was playing as a striker. He used to drop back and help out midfield/defence.

Yes Levy has a great business model to make the club sustainable and this allows us to buy players like Eriksen and Chiriches.

We're so close to being a great team we just need good manager. We have our ""star players"" in the making in Lamella and Eriksen.

I need to see some more of what we had at the end of last year to stay on the Lambo-train.  I want him to stay and be given some money to spend on 1-3 QUALITY, youngish players.  I fully understand and agre with his signings so far.  I honestly can't see how anyone complains as about his sigining considering none of them have been a huge dud.  Holt and Bennet are doing what the job were hired for.

Lambert is known for giving youngsters a chance but I'm not sure i fully agree with that.  He seems to have favorites that he puts a lot of faith in (think of when he first played players like Weimann, Benteke, Baker, and Bacuna).  These players playing well makes him look like a genius with young players.  However what about players like Helenius, Albrighton, and some of the academy players that arguably should have been called up.  The never really got chances (although Ablrighton is getting one now).  Then there is Lowton who he just dropped.  Where has Gardner been?  My hope is that he gets some of these guys more chances this year.  We aren't going to get relegated, and there isn't a whole lot to fight for.  Might as well test some of our untested players.

I'm also unsure about his tactics.  I don't think he wants to be a longball manager so I want to give him another summer to get a solid number 10 so he can change that.

Not needing air con - I fucking hate air con, but it's absolutely essential here

Traffic - UK traffic is amazingly civilised. We moan, but compared to driving just about anywhere else, UK traffic is really safe and civilised.

Sweets and snacks - sweets here fucking suck. No wine gums, no gummy sweets no mints. All the sweets are weird milk-based or hard candy.

Supermarket selection - again, here it sucks. UK has way better selections of just about anything. Go to the crisp aisle and you find maybe 40 different varieties.

Noise - holy shit, the UK is peaceful by comparison. Constant noise will drive you insane. And it's not just associated with being busy. It's unnecessary noise. Here TV adverts fucking YELL at you (worse than UK), adverts play on the street, ATMs yell at you, buses make constant announcements (at very high volume), and there is seemingly no regulation on car/bike noise. I also don't think there is any regulation about unsociable hours either, since noise continues way past 11pm.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"What you have explained is a system that plays two strikers. Just because one is behind the striker and drops back doesn't mean he is a false 9.

The false 9 is a system. The purpose of the False 9 is to open space for the incoming midfielder or winger by dragging a centre back. If the centre back does not follow, the ""9"" is then given freedom to make a run.

Why it works is the fact that it causes confusion to the centre backs. If the ""9"" drops back, the CBs are essentially free and two CBs have decide if they follow the ""9"" or stick to their position for the incoming midfielder. Thus why it is called a false 9. Because, well, there is no striker (9) in the box. 

Let me try to elaborate that for you. If there is already a striker occupying the box, it easier for the CBs to make the decision on who they should cover. Now, if the secondary striker moves out deeper to try to create space, all he is doing is playing his role. As a secondary striker.

As far as Tevez goes, you mentioned that during that season Man U ""Ronaldo, Nani, and Rooney were their only real attacking threats"" Neglecting the fact that Tevez played a more important role than Nani as he was the other striker besides Rooney. This seems to be a reoccurring thing for you.

And yes, Man U did play some 4-5-1, with Tevez up front. Not Rooney. So, your whole ""Rooney played as a false 9"" claim still means absolutely nothing. 

What you can claim is that, at times, Man U played without a striker. This means BOTH Rooney and Tevez dropping back to create an essentially a 4-6-0 formation, in other words, a false 9 system.  

Stick with what you know.

Also, I would like a competent back up keeper in the event of Migs going down because I don't think Jones would be ready for Champions league type competition.

I can't envisage anything good (other than the £££), but it might be entertaining mayhem. Realistically Championship is the wiser choice - they will have to bring in quite a few players to replace those on the outbound, even if we deployed the squad above you'd still need a lot of cover for probable injuries. It will be far easier to make those acquisitions in the Championship where stupid sums of TV money aren't sending everyone a little hyperactive. This is all leaving aside whatever ball and chain FFP will/won't be securing around the club's neck.

&gt;We're still a Championship club trying to become a Premier League club. I think we should do that one step at a time, with a plan, rather than a short-term smash and grab.

The club has big plans, and presumably the money in place to fuel those plans, but that doesn't guarantee these things will happen. In terms of more tangible assets they have simply got an ageing senior squad of playing and coaching staff, a charismatic but rickety old stadium and a training facility from which Jose Mourinho turned away in disgust upon first seeing it on a quest for a temporary replacement for Chelsea. The Championship is still a respectable league. It provides a decent level to develop a squad for a few years down the line as the board start to get to work on the other projects - as far off as the stadium would be, Warren Farm at least should be up in a few years. That can be the first step in building up some credibility for their competence.

I'm beginning to get a little wary of the power structure within the club though - I can't name a single source for inspiration within the organisation. The media team do a great job..but Fernandes has hardly been in the UK over the season, Redknapp and his people have done their thing, Beard...I dunno. Steve Gallen and co. are presumably powerless. Do we even retain full time scouts? Since Ian Butterworth left I don't know of any. I think merely hoping that there are unknown names keeping things heading in the right direction behind the scenes is wishful thinking. Amit Bhatia needs to focus on proving himself in his other business ventures - not usually possible at a football club - and so I don't think he's in a position to take any more control.

It seems like nearly every try now goes to the TMO, even when it's plain as day. I think the pendulum has swung a bit too far.

For things like forward passes in rugby or offsides in football, they should be able to automate that process too. I'd say 10 times as many goals are incorrectly judged due to offsides than due to errors about whether the goal crossed the line or not.

Also, rugby is far less of a flowing game than football. Even when the ball is in play it spends a good chunk of that time slowed down in rucks.

They could easily integrate a TMO into the game if they restricted it's use to situations where the game has naturally come to a stop - the ball is out of play or a foul has been called - then the ref can decide if the foul is a yellow or a red, if the foul was in or outside the box or if there was a foul before the ball ended up in the net.

Subscribed sometime in autumn and I am of few those that become fan only recently

Started following up on the game years ago, but only on major tournaments, world cup, euro, and then started with champions league, but only later stages and never really emotionally vested much... mostly watched because people around me watched.

Then I started to track few national leagues how they progress, whose where, who dominates and stuff... as it gets also mentioned in commentaries during champions league and started to watch some matches even on my own(wow right?)

Then I decided that I need to follow on some league and choose a team to cheer for, as it should better the experience of the league and motivates me to track it better.

Premier league was easy choice as I am already on reddit and theres shitload of content to it on /r/soccer not to mention the quality and vast amount of money flowing through and streams being in easy english...

Me being a contrarian and few people around me already supporting arsenal and chelsea mostly for success and their czech players, and coupled with the nationality of skrtel(yay for nationalism, though at the time it seemed that he might be benched a lot as there seemed to be plenty of CBs in the squad) and apparent potential that liverpool has...  I choose liverpool

Though at first was kinda doubtful about the choice as I would not get to see the team play in the champions league... but whatever at least I can finally follow premier league more closely which was the objective to begin with. Plus I could claim later some points for sticking with them in the rough times(i am being completely serious, that actually crossed my mind during choosing)

went to 4chan and &gt;&gt;&gt;/sp/ some during matches and consulted them about shit and being new...  immediate linsk to piratebay and 2005 finals...

And then I realized theres liverpool subreddit... and so here I am

Also, [john green](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9) who I liked to watch on youtube is staunch supporter... 

The things I learned so far.

So technically, she hasn't done anything wrong, because the rules allowed her to do what she did, and a committee of her peers found in her favor. On top of this Cameron doesn't want to allow the media the opportunity to force his hand, because he knows that it will just make the next one easier and this will weaken his position.

What can we do about this? Very little. The only thing we can do is to keep the story in the press by reading the articles that are published and sharing them with others. The longer the story goes on, the more pressure he will be under to act. If this dies out in the next few days, then he can keep her on until his election reshuffle and allow her to step aside. She will go (because she isn't actually that good at her job and is disliked by her own party), but this will allow Cameron to save face. 

She will likely keep her money and her £1.2M farmhouse in Mapledurwell that was paid for by suddenly claiming her 2nd home (where her parents lived) was her primary residence to avoid capital gains tax. And go on to a be shitty middle management type on a large salary again.

All four referees quickly discuss and confirm on their ear pieces and decide. If it's clear the ref switches the call and awards a free kick to the winning team. If it's unclear the original call stands, and that is signaled by some sort of strong gesture, to reaffirm confidence or some bullshit refs feelings need.

The OP is correct, as I agree that much weight is placed on Arse's game with West Ham. Big Sam's life energy is sustained by feeding off disheartened stronger sides on paper, and if they can get anything from the game then of course the pressure gets cranked to an 11 out of 10 on Woolwich. This current squad has proven to be the most mentally crackable Arse squad in years, so it just may be the spark needed for them to collapse.

It's true that Everton's remaining schedule makes them more catchable. Man City is locked in a tight title race so will of course be a tough fight for them, and Man U's coach and players will be fighting for their pride.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Adding £7,000 to everyone's income would simply create inflation. It might end up mildly distributing income but it would cause inflation and it wouldn't be anything close to an income you can live on.

Except you're not adding £7000 to everyone's income, because the basic income is paid for with taxes, some of which would increase to pay for the basic income, lowering some peoples' incomes. The money supply would not change and the rate of inflation would be largely unaffected.

&gt;Even if I suspend my knowledge of the workings of economics for a second and presume that it wouldn't inflate away income until prices readjust, it would damage work incentives.

There are a number of studies which suggest that it would have the inverse effect. People starting work no would longer lose benefits at the same rate (or, as in some cases, a rate greater than that) at which their income rises and their increased financial mobility would allow them to pursue greater income-generating opportunities.

&gt;Why not have a Citizens Income except one which tapers away once you earn a certain amount so that it doesn't have all of the negative effects listed above?

These ideas are not mutually exclusive (see: progressive taxation).

Well, I've seen people queue jump to get on buses in London.  

Another time, I started to get on a bus in Islington before I noticed that there had been an invisible queue which had assembled when the bus arrived.  I turned around and walked to the back of the queue even though I was by the door.  The people in line made ""No, go ahead"" gestures, like they thought it was a bit much to be worried about a bus queue.  After all, with Oyster cards, those move really fast, but the first people get the best seats, so I went to the back of the line.

The other things you mentioned are inexcusable.  I've also seen them happen in England, but it's been non-Brits and non-Americans who were the culprits.  I've never seen people cut in line at a CVS or any place in the US, really, but maybe I've just been lucky.  People were ranting about the rude Italians the last time I was in London, and I saw lots of Chinese people who apparently didn't understand queues.

His job isn't so much to break up attacks, as it is to start them. He often relies on the pressing of those in front of him to win the ball back. So I think having a true defensive mid if nothing else could add a tactical option.

Of our current former academy players still with us, Micah is not getting any playing time and the same with Boyata. Guidetti is also out on loan at Stoke. If I were an academy player at city (oh how I wish), I would look at my alumni and think that there would be better opportunities elsewhere. I would probably let my contract run down and if the club renews it then I'll stay and fight for a place.

But back to the point, this only confirms that it would be difficult to get into the first team at the moment. Pellegrini seems like he's placing success over blooding youngsters, compared to Pearce, Keegan and Hughes in the past, but it's probably down to the current pressure of the managerial seat than anything else. 

I don't know whether Pellegrini will change his approach once he wins his 5 trophies (4 remaining!) but the future as a city youngster does not look too bright now.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"For the question regarding your husband: no, you can't apply for him to become a UK citizen just because you are one. For him to become a UK citizen the following would have to happen.

1. You would have to move over here and start living permanently in the UK.

2. You could then apply for a spousal visa to bring your husband over to join you. The rules for this have been significantly tightened in the last couple of years and the main thing to note is that you MUST have a job that pays over the minimum visa threshold (currently £18,600 p.a., and that figure increases if you have kids). If you don't earn enough money the visa won't be granted, no matter how many years you've been married. Yes, that sucks. There IS a loophole but only if you happen to have a passport belonging to a different EU country other than Britain, and even that is likely to be closed in the next 12 months or so.

3. Once he's over here on a spousal visa he'll have the right to live here and work here, as long as the two of you remain married. After he's lived here for 5 years on the spousal visa he'll be able to apply to have his visa converted to Permanent Residency. This will give him all the rights of a UK citizen (with one or two minor exceptions, notably being not allowed to vote in some elections) and he can stay here even if the two of you then separate.

4. He can also at this point apply to be naturalized for UK citizenship. That will involve taking an English language test (shouldn't be too tricky if he's American!) and passing the Life in the UK test.

Not quite, it allows an attacker to read a small portion of a server's memory, conceivably this could end up leaking private keys which would then in turn allow an attacker to perform a man in the middle attack, but its not as simple as simply exposing the contents of your traffic.

I remember from UKIPs policies (before they were changed few weeks ago) there was one point saying that EU immigrants, if they have been living here for something 5 or 6 years, they COULD apply for a permit to stay in the UK. What's funny, there was specifically added sentence something like ""if they fulfil criteria requirements"". But that's obviously ""loonies"" policies as I imagine they haven't got a clue themselves.

What would actually happen? Hard to say but most probably nothing to everybody who came here before UK officially leaves the EU. Even if someone came here just few days before. I would imagine though, there would be put a requirement to get some kind of permit to stay and that would probably mean proving you have some ties in the UK. Probably a job or a family would be enough.

Funny thing is, that we would know the date of the departure and plenty of EU migrants would migrate into UK in a hurry, just to get a final opportunity to live here. As for now they make more controlled decisions because if not this month, they could migrate the next one or think whether to migrate at all (and whether to this country).

As other countries would get quite angry on UK's decision and possible treatment of their citizens, they would most probably apply the same requirements (possibly even harsher ones just to prove a point?). So if a British emigrant had a confirmation of his ties in that country, he would probably be allowed to apply for a permit to stay.

For a bit of perspective, Coentrao and Alves are the most expensive full-backs and they were transferred for £26m and £28m respectively - both around the peak of their value in terms of age. I think any club would be stupid to pay that much for Shaw, even if he is English. I reckon unless there's a bidding war between Chelsea and City or something he'll probably be around £20m, which is about what we paid for Henderson. 

And Flanagan's preferred side is at right-back, so I don't think buying Shaw is necessarily pushing him out of the side. They're both very solid long-term replacements for Enrique and Johnson.

- Offering homeopathic products may stop some people from seeking appropriate medical care. This means that if they do enter the normal medical system after trying a homeopathic remedy they may be more difficult, and more expensive to treat. They may even die.

The first ([Road Traffic Act 1988, section 36](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/36)) explicitly applies only to ""drivers"". Genuine question: does the legal definiton of ""driver"" cover anyone ""driving"" a vehicle on the road, including cyclists? A quick skim through the rest of the legislation appears to only use the term ""drive"" and its derivatives to refer to the use of ""mechanically propelled vehicles"". It is arguable that a bicycle is ""mechanically propelled"", after a fashion.

The second ([Traffic Signs Rules &amp; General Directions 2002, section 10(1)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/regulation/10/made)) lists a whole load of signs covered by the RTA 1988 legislation, none of which appear to be a speed limit sign.

It's worth taking away from this comment that I understand the *spirit* of that rule, and I do still believe that in many cases (and particularly around other vulnerable road users) cyclists should obey speed limits, I'm just being pedantic.

It is an unfortunate story, but that's the nature of scholarships. I've got a scholarship for my PhD, and I know that, if for any reason, I can't complete my work for a period of time, they wont pay me for it.

I also know that I'm not allowed to take on too much work on the side, and if I do, they could cancel my scholarship.

But that's the nature of a scholarship. It's not a wage. It's a effectively a grant or donation. In most cases, it's totally untaxed as a result.

I'm not saying it's right, but *most* of the issues she's encountered are pretty clearly explained in the terms of my scholarship at least. If she didn't want to take the risk of ending up in that situation, she shouldn't have taken the scholarship.

Just to confirm, I'm not saying it's right that scholarships work this way. Is what I'm saying is that this isn't new, and the way to fight this isn't to take a scholarship and bitch and moan when they hold you to the T&amp;C you agreed to.

But in her defence, she should have moved with her supervisor really.

I thought by accidental misrepresentation. E.g. ""Do you have a second home?"" ""hmm, I have a second home, tick yes"" unaware that when they say second home, they mean second home that you live in, not a home that you own for someone else to live in.

But I'd like to find out more about how they reached the decision that she had ""accidentally"" over-claimed.

&gt; When they say ignorance is no excuse, it's an ignorance of the law. The law states that fraud is deliberate.

That's exactly why I said ""I was going to say"" because when I looked into it, (again, as I said above) fraud requires intent. (so accidental misrepresentation doesn't legally count as fraud).

&gt; I wouldn't want someone prosecuted for an error as long as the error was rectified. It's petty if nothing else and benefits nobody.

I agree to some extent. But I'd like to see whatever profits she took from it. My understanding is that other people have suggested she over-claimed 10's of thousands of pounds and suggested she should pay back closer to £50k. 

But she instead agreed to pay back around £5,000. If she really did claim 10's of thousands on her mortgage, there's a big chance that had she not had that opportunity, she wouldn't have taken the mortgage in the first place and consequently wouldn't have got the £1million profit from selling it on later.",0,1397037589,null,0,false,0,cgnygyu,t3_22kgmk,t1_cgnygyu,t1_cgnybvu,null,1433276808,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For example, had Germany won the Second World War (not that much of a stretch, it looked bad at points), obliterated the population and planted millions of Germans here, would you then think it is fair and right for the UK to be considered German? I don't, but that's because I am looking at the historical context. 

Anyway, I don't have much more to say on this matter. It's pretty clear that there is a strong nationalistic vibe on this subreddit which in my opinion borders on jingoistic when it comes to territorial matters. I'm not sure why instead of discussing it rationally, people just choose to down vote anything that is not ""Rule Britannia"".

Of course people should take responsibility, but there's also the case of treating with humanity and compassion.  If a child is scared of monsters under the bed we know there aren't sub-mattress dwelling monsters roaming suburbia but that doesn't stop us from appreciating that whilst the threat isn't real, the fear is.  In that spirit parents go through the ritual of looking under the bed for something they know doesn't exist just to reassure.  Homeopathy is an insecure adult version akin to looking under the bed for monsters.

Similarly if an adult with no background in science or medicine, but who has instead adopted a whole swathe of notions, misconceptions, and superstitions to get them through day to day life is suddenly faced with a potentially life changing paradigm it's perfectly understandable if they feel out of control and are filled with doubt and misgivings.  If it means that they're more open to the science if doctors play along a little with their imaginary worldview, and it makes the patient more comfortable but effects the condition neither way - then why the hell not as long as it's costing peanuts?

The doctor doesn't even have to approve.  They can make their own views on homeopathy well known to the patient if they want to.  But then, after all is said and done, if offering homeopathy in parallel is a means of making them feel more secure, or giving them a little extra hope whilst they keep on with the science based medicine, then go for it.

I personally am putting forward several arguments based in fact which I think are counterpoints to the things you are suggesting. You are the one who is dismissing everything everyone who disagrees with you as being nationalistic. 


I understand your point that you shouldn't be able to just move people from one country to another then claim it as your own. You mentioned Crimea, I would suggest you look up who the Crimean Tatars are if you want to see a group of people who have truly had their homeland stolen from them. The way the Soviet Union treated them, and how Russia continues to treat them is appalling.  

However, my point is that the time scale over which the population has changed in Northern Ireland is far too long for it to be the only issue to consider today. Should America be given back to the Native Americans? The truth is the majority of people in all of Ireland are happy with how things are now. No one is homeless, no one is starving or dying because of how the borders have been draw. People on both sides are happy. Claiming that Northern Ireland should be ""Given back"" (Again I ask, who was it taken from?) would cause far more harm and upset than benefits. 

&gt;had Germany won the Second World War (not that much of a stretch, it looked bad at points), obliterated the population and planted millions of Germans here, would you then think it is fair and right for the UK to be considered German?

It would depend on how the remaining native population was being treated by the Germans in part, but there are so many factors involved its impossible to say. My answer would be, its possible people would be ok with it, eventually, and its possible people would be upset.

Make yourself visible, wear high visibility clothing and have good lights. If you are a driver then cyclists can be pretty hard to spot on busy roads until you get close to them.

[Learn where vehicle blind spots are](http://www.motorcyclebasics.com/blind-spots.html), **especially for lorries**. Most cyclists are killed on the road because they cycle up the inside of a lorry (in between the lorry and the pavement) and are killed when the lorry turns (lorries move in towards the curb when they turn). Remember that they can't see you. it is better to wait behind a lorry at lights than to cycle up beside it.

Wear a helmet, don't believe the people who say that you are safer without one, you aren't.  cyclists are *slightly* more likely to have a neck injury when wearing a helmet, but *significantly less* likely to suffer head, brain or face injuries, and more importantly, less likely to die. This is especially important in towns when there is heavier traffic.

Where possible, stick close to the curb, remember that cars will not always be able to give you a lot of space when overtaking due to oncoming traffic. But as others have said said, it may be necessary to take a whole lane at times.

true,Number-6,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"&gt; The Government is today announcing the next steps in the reform of GCSEs and A levels.

&gt; We are introducing more rigorous content into reformed GCSEs and A levels to be taught from September 2016 and 2015 respectively.

&gt; Our changes will make these qualifications more ambitious, with greater stretch for the most able; will prepare young people better for the demands of employment and further study; will address the pernicious damage caused by grade inflation and dumbing down, which have undermined students’ achievements for far too long; and will give pupils, parents, teachers, universities and employers greater confidence in the integrity and reliability of our qualifications system.

&gt; GCSEs

&gt; In November of last year, the Department for Education published details of revised content for GCSEs in English and mathematics, for first teaching from September 2015.

&gt; Today, I am publishing revised content for GCSEs in science, history, geography and languages, which will be taught in schools from September 2016.

&gt; These GCSEs set higher expectations. They demand more from all students and specifically provide further challenge to those aiming to achieve top grades.

&gt; In science, the level of detail and scientific knowledge required has increased significantly, and there are clearer mathematical requirements for each topic. New content has been added, including the study of the human genome, gene technology, life cycle analysis, nanoparticles and space physics.

&gt; In history, every student will be able to cover medieval, early modern and modern history - rather than focusing only on modern world history, as too many students do now. Greater emphasis has been placed on British history, which will account for 40% of GCSE rather than 25%, as now; balanced by an increase in the number of geographical areas studied, and an explicit expectation that students will study the wider world. The new GCSE is also be clearer about the range of historical knowledge and methods students will need to develop, from critical assessment of sources to an understanding of chronology, individuals, events and developments.

&gt; In geography, the balance between physical and human geography has been improved - developing students’ locational and contextual knowledge of the world’s continents, countries and regions and their physical, environmental and human features - alongside a requirement that all students study the geography of the UK in depth. Students will also need to use a wide range of investigative skills and approaches, including mathematics and statistics, and we have introduced a requirement for at least 2 examples of fieldwork outside school.

&gt; In modern languages, greater emphasis has been placed on speaking and writing in the foreign language, thorough understanding of grammar and translation of sentences and short texts from English into the language. Most exam questions will be set in the language itself, rather than in English; and there will be a sharper focus on using the language appropriately in different contexts, from personal travel to employment or study abroad.

&gt; Finally, ancient languages have been given a separate set of criteria for the first time, reflecting their specific requirements. Students will now need to translate unseen passages into English, and will have the option to translate short English sentences into the ancient language. We have also provided greater detail about the range and type of literature and sources to be studied, without specifying particular set texts.

A levels

&gt; I am also publishing revised content for A levels in English literature, English language, English literature and language, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, history, economics, business, computer science, art and design and sociology, for first teaching from September 2015.

&gt; The content for these A levels was reviewed and recommended by Professor Mark E. Smith, vice-chancellor of Lancaster University, drawing on advice from subject experts from higher education establishments and subject associations.

&gt; By placing responsibility for the content of A levels in the hands of university academics, we hope that these new exams will be more rigorous and will provide students with the skills and knowledge needed for progression to undergraduate study.

&gt; I thank Professor Smith and all of those involved for their conscientious work and thoughtful suggestions - and I have accepted all of their recommendations for A level content.

&gt; In the sciences, computer science, economics and business, mathematical and quantitative content has been strengthened: for example, understanding standard deviation in biology and the concepts underlying calculus in physics.

&gt; In computer science, basic ICT content has been removed and emphasis has been placed instead on programming and far more detailed content on algorithms.

&gt; In the sciences, there will also be a new requirement that students must carry out a minimum of 12 practical activities, ensuring that they develop vital scientific techniques and become comfortable using key apparatus. This will make sure that all A level scientists develop the experimental and practical skills essential for further study.

&gt; In history, as well as covering the history of more than one country or state beyond the British Isles, A level students will also now be required to study topics across a chronological range of at least 200 years - increasing breadth of focus.

&gt; In English literature, to ensure a broad and balanced curriculum, specified texts will include three works from before 1900 - including at least one play by Shakespeare - and at least one work from after 2000. In addition, we have reintroduced the requirement for A level students to be examined on an ‘unseen’ literary text, to encourage wide and critical reading.

&gt; Finally, in economics, content has been updated to include the latest issues and topics - for example, financial regulation and the role of central banks.

&gt; Copies of the content for these reformed GCSEs and reformed A levels are available.

&gt; Alongside these announcements, Ofqual is today setting out its decisions on how these new GCSEs and A levels should be assessed - with linear assessment rather than modules, and a greater focus on exams rather than controlled assessment.

&gt; All of these reformed A levels will be ready for first teaching in schools from September 2015, and reformed GCSEs from September 2016.

&gt; Awarding organisations will publish their detailed specifications for these A levels this autumn, and for these GCSEs next autumn - giving schools plenty of time to prepare.

New A levels and GCSEs from 2016

&gt; Based on the advice of the A level content advisory board established by the Russell Group of leading universities, I have also already announced that A levels in mathematics, languages and geography will be reformed for first teaching from September 2016.

&gt; I can announce today that GCSEs and A levels in religious studies, design &amp; technology, drama, dance, music and PE - and GCSEs in art &amp; design, computer science and citizenship - will also be reformed and brought up to these new, higher standards for first teaching at the same time, in September 2016.

&gt; Awarding organisations and subject experts will draft content for these new A levels and GCSEs over the coming months, and we will consult on their recommendations for content - while Ofqual consults on its recommendations for assessment - later in the year.

&gt; All our reforms to GCSEs and A levels complement the changes we have already made to technical and vocational qualifications, removing those which are not endorsed by businesses or employer bodies from league tables, and leaving only those which represent real achievement.

&gt; Taken together, these changes mean that every young person in this country will have the opportunity to study high-quality, rigorous, demanding qualifications across the academic and vocational curriculum from September 2016 onwards.

&gt; These changes will increase the rigour of qualifications, strengthening the respect in which they are held by employers and universities alike. Young people in England deserve world-class qualifications and a world-class education - and that is what our reforms will deliver.

At history GCSE, we looked at 3 things: the First World War, Liberal Reforms of the Early 20th century, and Inter-War Germany. That's 3 things in a 30 year period. New reforms would change this to a 300-1000 year period, which is far too long, and not specific enough to study in 2 years. Also, GCSE history should be about learning 'how' to do history, not a load of facts, which Gove seems to be suggestings. 

A-Level History, again, seems to take the policy of 'more is better'. I see no reason to double the period studied from 100 years to 200, as there is plenty of stuff to study in a 100 year period.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I was in the same situation as you and this took me months of emails and calls to work out. It's a bit tricky so prepare yourself.

I'm sure you know to become a clinical psychologist (I presume this is what you want to do) you need to do a 4th year (honours or specialist) in Australia. This fourth year will have a thesis/research project component that all degrees in UK have and you don't have to apply for it. Once you do honours here you can then apply for a masters in Australia, however it is very competitive with 15 positions and about about 450 applicants per uni.

If you just do a specialist 4th year, you can be a registered psychologist which is basically 'psychologist lite' and your pay is capped. This isn't really an option in the UK, closest thing is an 'assistant clinical psychologist'.

In the UK, all degrees are honours degrees (the third year has a dissertation), however it is no where near as intensive as what an Australian honours year is. Overall, a UK undergrad is harder than an AU undergrad, but honours is the equivalent of a masters or mini phd. We complete a thesis (original piece of work) whilst in UK they do a dissertation (synthesis and adding own comments). 

To become a clinical psychologist in the UK with an Australia B.A, you're going to have to either complete a 4th year in AU (Apply for honours everywhere or transfer into a course with a fourth year option), or go to British Psychological Association website and search for masters/postgrad degrees in the UK that will give you GBC (Graduate Basis Membership). Once you complete a 1 year conversion course/graddip/masters, you will have GBC.

Note: Even if you have a UK passport (dual citizenship AU and UK?), you won't be paying EU fees as you are not a resident. I am the same. You have to live in the UK/EU for 5 years to pay EU fees so you will be paying international fees upwards of $25000 AUD for your Converstion Course/GradDip of 1 year. If you're able to pay that then you'll be fine. Otherwise it is best to get into a fourth year in AU. If you do that and get an average of 80, you can send your transcripts to the BPA and they'll give you GBC as it is equivalent. Main focus is completing this research project/thesis/dissertation at a 2:1/80% level.

Once you've got GBC, a masters in psychology in the UK is of little use, just make your resume look better to get the assistant psychologist job (which are also incredibly competitive so it can help if you're happy to throw down the money and another year) and will cost upwards of $25k/£16k.

You want to do a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology to become a Clinical Psychologist which is 3 years, funded by the NHS at £22k a year and involves 2 years practical training and a 100k word thesis.

You can apply for 4 universities and there are usually 500 applicants for each and 15 positions at each uni (about 16 offer the course) and there's about 1200 applicants for UCL (London), less in places like Bangor (200 applicants). 

You need a minimum 2:1 and which converts to an Australian Distinction degree, however most will have a HD average. You also have to have done 6 months to 1 year work as an Assistant Clinical Psychologist/Research Assistant/Social Worker to even be considered for an interview. They invite about 50 people in for interviews in June each year.


tldr: 
if you can, do a 4th/honours/specialist year in Australia because it'll cost you $5000. 
If you didn't get accepted into any of the honours applied for look at other options such as forensic psychology/developmental psychologist/counselling psychologist. 
Move to the UK and find work as an assistant psychologist using your UK visa.
Apply for D.Clin degrees, get funded by the NHS and become a clinical psychologist.



I hope that's helped a bit. I hope it doesn't come across as too presumptuous but I wish someone told me all this. Becoming a psychologist is cut throat as it is and there's many hoops to jump through. Moving countries makes it much harder but it's possible if you have the $ and put the hard work in.

Firstly, AS physics does not include any calculus - a vital tool that's used everyday by physicists and undergrads. Explaining newton's laws of motion is, in my opinion, an easier task when calculus is involved. 

Most people take maths and physics, and they teach calculus in maths. If someone isn't taking maths and physics, it is unlikely that they would take physics at university, as I believe most universities require a certain grade in maths to accept you for a physics degree. In my A-Level Physics class, I think only one person isn't doing maths (and they did maths at AS Level), and I'm one of the few people not taking Further Maths. 

&gt; Secondly, why on Earth is 85% of the AS physics course based on physics that's been around for ~200 odd years. Quantum mechanics is tagged on at the end, without calculus. I'm not saying we should teach cutting edge physics, instead physics that's being debated today. It really makes you wonder why so people take STEM subjects.

The basics are the most important parts to learn, and the easiest. It doesn't matter that Newtons Laws have been around for hundreds of years, they still hold up, and are the basis for pretty much everything else. More modern doesn't necessarily mean better when it comes to learning physics.

I took a look at the stats for our midfielders in the first and second half, and they all improved in terms of making passes in the second half when we had more space to operate in and more of the ball. In light of this, I'm not sure Lucas would have been as influental in that first half either.

No, because many greens reject nuclear power while simulataneously rejecting all fossil fuels, which is completely ridiculous unless you just want to get rid of about 70% of the human population (and by get rid, I mean genocide).

They oppose nuclear power and gas fired turbine plants and as a result we continue to use coal. By taking an all or nothing approach when ""all"" isn't achievable we get nothing.

It's one of the only things I am obsessed with, read about everyday, and am truly passionate about.

     My first live game was at Anfield in the 00-01 season when I wasn't even a fan of the club (my dad is a Gooner). When we beat Everton 3-1, the atmosphere in the Kop end was, and still is, the most amazing feeling I've ever had at a sports event. The passion of this team and it's supporters won me over. I fell in love. Hearing YNWA ring out in the stands sent chills down my spine. And I couldn't stop smiling. After, I started to learn more about the club, it's rivalries, it's 4 European Cups (this was pre-Istanbul), and most importantly, the 96 at Hillsborough.  

     But the game that changed everything was that night against Olympiakos... Gerrard became my hero that day. Well that gave me such inspiration, something great to believe in, a cause I really wanted to get behind. And well, we went to Istanbul and pulled off the greatest comeback in football ever. And that was it. Liverpool was my team, and I felt I earned the right to say it.

I really dislike this direction of thought - if we think this way, we discard all the a-levels without a direct application to 'office jobs'...science, mathematics, history, geography...

Regardless, I'm not sure I agree there should be an 'office skills' a-level, but even if so it should be clearly labelled as that, and not pretend to be computer science.

As a separate point, I suspect programming is *already* a useful side skill in many office jobs, just mostly an unrecognised one because nobody knows how to do it or is expected to make use of it. Of course this part is highly subjective, but I maintain the opinion that programming should be considered something of a life skill - not everyone will (or should) make use of it, but merely teaching people the very basics will be highly beneficial just so that more people are aware the tool exists if they need it.

&gt; It will still be a waste of time for anybody who plans to take CS at university level,

Maybe so, but I'd more optimistically say it *shouldn't* be, and that moving towards making the a-level teach the serious subject can only be a good thing.

As long as you're able to get him a spousal visa he'll have the same rights to live here, to pick and choose jobs, to be entitled to NHS treatment and (eventually) even some welfare benefits in the same way as a UK citizen would. And the spousal visa WILL be granted assuming you meet the income requirement and that he doesn't have any serious criminal convictions.

My wife is American and she's been in the UK for fifteen years now, but she's never bothered to claim UK citizenship as the only real advantage she'd get for doing so would be the right to vote in elections. As she's completely uninterested in politics she doesn't think that's value for money for the £1,000 it would cost!

She has an Indefinite Leave to Remain stamp in her passport (it's now called Permanent Residency) which is effectively analogous to a US Green Card -- i.e. she has no restrictions on where in the country she wants to live, or what job she can do, basically the only way she could get thrown out of the UK would be if she committed a very serious crime and might then get her visa status withdrawn. Hopefully that won't happen :)

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; What should our education systems be aiming to produce?

Ability with higher forms of thinking. Education historically has been about a move from lower to higher orders of knowledge.

Back in older days simple facts were hard to acquire. The man with the facts was educated. Then we had books.

In latter days communication was king. Networks for efficient communication were tricky and the clever men who managed them had a position of high office. Then we had the telegram.

50 years ago it was all about the process. The man who understood and could apply a finite and well defined process over and over was educated. This has steadily been replaced with computers and machinery.

So where is the next stage? Unstructured creative thinking. Design work. Scientific endeavour. Treating with unknowns and abstracts. Anything where you deal in trade offs and justifications rather than binary right/wrong answers. These are at the heart of any future educated employment which is why the creative and services industries keeps growing.

&gt; Should we be trying to emulate Asian nations who perform well internationally?

No. The international metrics on these systems are irrelevant. They measure performance at fact retention and process execution. The very traits we've just said are increasingly outmoded. The Asian systems outperforms ours not because they are good but because they are out of date. They are doing the type of thing we did when process was king. We've been trying to deal with the reality of computing and automation. Developing the type of knowledge needed to treat with a post information revolution age. Of course we do worse against outdated schools using outdated metrics to measure outdated goals.

&gt; Students attitude to education?

Will always be tricky. Fortunately the creative focus our schools should be aimed at inspires interest far more easily. For the most part our mechanisms should aim more at remedial education to try and deal with the hopelessness that saps enthusiasm in the bulk of the population at school.",0,1397048845,null,0,false,0,cgo0t5g,t3_22lk2l,t1_cgo0t5g,t3_22lk2l,null,1433277903,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

To answer your question about a proper system I really don't know. My thought, though, is that we should have options.  We should be able to play defensive when we want to play defensive, offensive when we want to play offensive, and retain the play when we want to retain the ball.

Labeling an argument pedantic does not show it to be fallacious. 

You appear to be arguing now, that things ought to remain the way they are because that is they way they are now. That is an instance of the naturalistic fallacy. It simply doesn't follow. It would suit Putin well in the Crimea. Do you apply it there as well?  If not, why not?

I notice you have abandoned the ""up to them"" formula. I take it you accept its fatal weakness. 

To be clear, I am not arguing for or against partition. I am saying that the dispute cannot be resolved by referring it to the people because the outcome will already have been decided by the choice of people to which to refer it. 

I am not saying that established historical reality counts for nothing, just that borders must come before we have an ""up to them"" because without borders there is no ""them"" for it to be up to. 

I find this conundrum tragic, not pedantic, because the scale of human suffering it has entailed is eye watericare I wish I could find a better way than war to resolve border disputes. Perhaps there is one. But ""up to them"" fails for the reason outlined. 


If you don't want to show me the flaw in my reasoning that's fine.  But the simple act of giving it a label does not help, for the reasoning still seems to bind us with the same logical force no matter what you call it. 

Downvoting doesn't help either. It merely mutely registers the fallacy of the argument from downvoting and in the absence of any support in words seems to say ""you are right but we don't care"". Perhaps that is the closest to winning an argument a fellow can hope to come.

In the CL some people set a stage they expect us to reach, but to me that's a bit pointless. If you aim for the semis and go out to Bayern Munich in the quarters you can't really say it's a failure, whereas if you aim for the quarters and go out to a weak Man Utd side it is a failure. 

So my hope for the Champions League was that if we are going to lose, to go out to one of the very best teams - Real, Barca and Bayern. Seems likely that if we do fail to win it will be one of those sides who puts us out, so we've achieved there, and getting to the semis after going out in the group last year is again a big improvement.

I hoped for a domestic cup too, and it's a shame to miss out but it's not the end of the world and it's certainly not season-defining.

You and Tebbit can choose to ignore this if you like.  I'm happy to acknowledge it, and I see it as progress that both of these men were sitting at the same table, celebrating what has already been achieved in Northern Ireland, and urging our governments toward more progress.

This notion of revenge is what kept the cycle of violence going for far too long.  As a bunch of people, we have the choice of moving on to give our children a better world than we inherited, or continuing the tit for tat killings.

The people of Ireland, North and South, voted to move on, and the governments of Ireland and the UK, as well as the Northern Ireland Assembly are all working to deliver on this.  Here's to the future!

A non-British EU citizen marries a non-EU spouse. They then perfectly legally obtain permission for the spouse to join them in whichever EU country they reside.  Immediately afterwards both the EU citizen and the now legally-in-the-EU spouse move to the UK under freedom of movement rules.  So this means that even though the non-EU spouse wouldn't have been given a visa to immigrate directly to the UK, because they can legally enter the EU via another route they can effectively bypass UK immigration legislation.

I believe there's legislation being drafted by the Home Office to prevent this explicit situation. Note they wouldn't be stopping the EU citizen moving here (because that would be illegal under EU law), only the non-EU spouse, if they don't also meet the UK spousal visa requirements.

You could never owe £5853 on a £100 loan from Wonga. If you borrow £100 from Wonga and don't repay it you will be entered into a repayment plan, once on a repayment plan interest is frozen. You could never owe £5853 on a £100 loan from Wonga, it's impossible.

Their point is that APR is misleading and irrelevant to their product, and you're proving that they're right. You're stating that because of their 5853% APR if you borrow £100 from Wonga for a year you'll owe £5853... but you can't! That's not possible, before your loan even hit £400 owed you would either be on a repayment plan or have repaid it.

I'm not stating that the APR figure is wrong, I'm stating that it is irrelevant. Yes you could use the figure to extrapolate what you would owe Wonga in 3, 6 or 12 months... but it's impossible for your debt to ever reach those figures because of the way that their service operates. Saying ""If I don't repay this Wonga loan in 12 months I'll owe £5853"" is categorically incorrect.

Talking about APR when using short term borrowing is like talking about the cost of a taxi drive to Scotland from London and back based on the price per mile you're paying for a trip from work to your house 2 miles away. If you pay £5 per mile in central London and then extrapolate that out for a return trip to Scotland it would cost you £4500... except you'd never be charged £5 per mile from London to Scotland, so it's an irrelevant and worthless figure.

I seriously doubt he's going to get sold this summer for two simple reasons. We won't want to take a loss on him, and no club is going to pay more than we paid for him. I seriously doubt the club is giving up on him. We know how good he can be, and other teams are going to be hesitant to make us richer and to give him a raise.

Expectations were obviously high so it's definitely disappointing and I see why there's a lot of media speculation, but I seriously doubt we would sell him at this point.

&gt; you don't spend that money for someone who isn't ready to play (and score) immediately

Yes and no. We as fans may have been impatient, but the club seemed to be very patient with acclimatizing him to the league. If we *had* been starting him every game and given him tons of minutes and he played poorly, you might have a stronger case. I think we were willing to wait, and if you look at quotes from the club, they all seemed to suggest he would need time to learn the league, learn the language, etc. I think the lack of preseason is also a factor.

true,therealmorris,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"You keep bringing up Crimea as a comparison but I don't see how that's valid. The problem with the referendum there was not simply that it happened, there were many flaws in the timing and manner of the referendum.

A much better comparison would surely be the Scottish independence referendum, which is going ahead after the party campaigning on the issue won a clear majority in free and fair elections with a well defined timescale and the support of the UK government.

None of these things happened in Crimea. The referendum [was called](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/ukraine-crisis-european-leaders-emergency-summit) just a few weeks in advance, in the midst of an incredibly turbulent time in Ukraine, with armed militia on the street. The [question itself](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-ukraine-crisis-referendum-idUSBREA2A1GR20140311) was problematic, with no option to retain the status quo (only to return to the 1992 situation or join Russia). It was [boycotted](http://www.rferl.org/content/crimean-tatar-leader-tells-people-to-stay-at-home-avoid-confrontations/25282669.html) by Crimean Tatars. And there was significant levels of propaganda (maybe on both sides, but [this](http://imgur.com/1ZDnof1) is the famous example)

Whether or not under different circumstances the result would have been different ([past polls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea_referendum,_2014#Polling) have suggested so) this is hardly the best example of self determination in action.

If it came to a referendum on Northern Ireland, I think it is far more likely to be conducted in a manor more similar to the Scottish one than Crimea. Personally I think self-determination is the best way to decide such issues. Maybe it's not perfect but I don't see any legitimate alternative, other than carrying on as things are. If N. Ireland were to vote to leave the UK and wanted to join Ireland, it would make sense for them [Republic of Ireland] to get a vote to accept them [N.

true,smokey815,num11,,"Eriksen needs to not be burdened with the defensive responsibilities.  I will say that to the day I die.  It's working in spite of the limitation.  And Ade as he's been playing, while not on Benzema level, is certainly good enough to play that role.  The problem is, Benzema is the least of that trio, and still beats our best.  Of course, we're not Madrid.  That is to be expected.  

But the main reason I think that this may not work for us is the lack of Bale/Ronaldo **type** players.  Townsend is the closest we have, and it's a laughable comparison.  Lamela isn't even a similar style of player to Di Maria in all honesty.  I don't even like the comparison of their roles.  He's not *really* a wide player.  Eriksen suits that style of play better, and Chadli too.  They're both good crossing, and seem to have a good understanding of where to be and when.  

Overall, I don't think that we compare to Madrid even in style.  For me, better to actually play something like what AVB intended on doing.    A solid DM, a playmaker/box to box hybrid, and true playmaker, and then an inverted winger or inside forward on one side and a proper winger on the other.  If we have Lamela on the right, that allows Walker to do his thing on that flank.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"My thoughts based on what has happened the last 15 games:

Rodgers will likely play either a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2 diamond the majority of the time next year.  Going by position:
*******************************
RB/LB:  We have Johnson and Flanno.  I fear that Enrique's injury means that he is done.  In my opinion, these are our positions of greatest need.  While Flanno has played well and Johnson is (hopefully) getting back to form, we have no depth and I don't believe that Flanno has the pace to track down the wingers/fullbacks that we will face in CL.  Add in the additional stresses of playing both CL, two cups, and PL...we need starter-level additions on both sides.
********************************
CB:  I may be the only person who thinks this, but I really think we are solid here.  Sakho/Skrtel as the starting pair and getting consistent game time together is a HUGE key.  We had so much rotation early this season due to injuries and that is the main cause of our issues IMO.  Agger/Kolo are better than any other team in the league backup-wise and we have young highly talented players after them.
*******************************************
Pivot/DM/Regista: We have Gerrard and Lucas for rotation.  Both are amazing at reading the game and both excel at this role.  I don't think that Rodgers even believes in using a destroyer, so I don't think we need to invest here.  I think that a good rotation of Lucas/Gerrard will keep both of them healthy, and if we do have a problem I think that we will be ok with Allen filling in for a few weeks.
************************************************
CM:  Henderson is our energy guy, box to box pressing, never stops running.  Allen is a ball winner metronome who calmly keeps possession and presses well, and Coutinho is our playmaker.  While these three have done admirably this year, I think we need one more energy player like Henderson to give him a break.  With Champion's league I just think asking him to play 50+ games is a little much.  I also think we need one more player who is adaptable enough to play...well, to be honest, like Sterling does.  Pressing up top, able to cut inside or play outside, and good at getting back to provide defensive support.  Willian, Kono, and Salah were meant for this role, so obviously Rodgers agrees with me there.  :)  In the 4-4-2 diamond there is also the front playmaker.

*********************************************
Striker:  Suarez and Sturridge...Borini.  This is the toughest for me.  We honestly hope that Sturridge are Suarez are healthy all year, and that means no one else is going to get much game time.  But our backups have been fairly poor, so if they do get hurt we are going to have some trouble.  Borini has been decent this year at Sunderland, but not good enough for title challenge/CL.  Unfortunately we don't have the money to have a Negredo, Dzeko, ect on the bench so this may need to be one of our young players in addition to Borini.

So, based on that I think we need one player in the Willian, Salah, Kono mold, one high energy midfielder (Gündoğan-type), and two FBs.",0,1397055963,null,0,false,0,cgo3hjt,t3_22kbbi,t1_cgo3hjt,t3_22kbbi,null,1433279169,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Actually a really shit Guardian article - nowhere near the level of most of their stuff.

For an article supposedly about Liverpool's transformation into title challengers, it sure talks about United a fuckton.

Let's actually answer the question then, shall we?

**The manager's system is versatile and makes us play as a team.** Rodgers has found a compromise between his ideal possession-based football and the more direct nature of the squad he's got at his disposal. We're ruthless on the counter-attack, relentless when we press, and gradually becoming more patient in possession when teams park the bus against us. Being able to do all of those lets us approach different teams in different ways - and that's without even mentioning our flexibility with formations. Most importantly, we have a recognisable identity and system that not only suits our players, but makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.

**Mental strength.** The dressing room seems really focused, calm and resilient. It's hard to quantify this stuff and compare it to previous seasons, but we've got Suarez keeping a cool head on the pitch, Gerrard talking about how previous sides would feel sorry for themselves but this one doesn't, and a number of youngsters playing like experienced PL veterans. Credit to Rodgers' man-management and the work of Dr. Steve Peters - and despite his occasional fuck ups on the pitch, bringing in Kolo on a free from City was a masterstroke to replace Carragher's experience and leadership.

**No European football** has certainly helped, given how small our squad is, especially in the attacking positions. It's also helped with match preparation and allowing Rodgers to keep players fit and fresh - not many teams would be able to continue to press with the intensity we do this late in the season, and that could prove vital in these last 5 games.

**Rodgers' individual coaching** has vastly improved certain players, and helped us cover for our lack of squad depth by making other players more flexible. Henderson's flourished, Skrtel's rejuvenated, Flanagan's come out of exile to become a regular - at left-back! - Sterling can play both flanks and behind the striker, Coutinho can play as a CM, and Gerrard's taken on the Xabi Alonso mantle.

**Suarez and Sturridge**. Well duh - both are having the best goalscoring seasons of their careers (I don't care how many Suarez scored in a single season for Ajax, the PL is obviously a much tougher league). Credit to Rodgers for finding ways to get them both playing up front at the same time, and credit to them for putting in a shift and not complaining during those times one of them has to play out wide.

**Fewer individual errors leading to goal**. Yeah, there's been some, and some have certainly cost us points, but all in all it's been much better than last season. Mignolet's been a big part of that, and Skrtel returning to form has helped as well.

**Our set piece strength** has helped make up for the lack of goals from midfield.

**Lack of expectation/pressure**. We're starting to show now that we can handle the pressure, but there's no doubt it's helped that we weren't even being mentioned as dark horses in this title race for much of the first half of the season. The goal was top 4, and even then Rodgers had his mantra of constant improvement and a long-term plan, and it can only have helped ensure we got into our title-challenging position without being under pressure the whole time.",0,1397056909,null,0,false,0,cgo3wfj,t3_22lvm7,t1_cgo3wfj,t3_22lvm7,null,1433279356,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

NINJA EDIT: I'm saying Lamela gets the right side, so the left (based on our current squad) is up for grabs b/t Chadli and Townsend.

For example, what safeguards, and who interprets them? Who's to say that it won't be abused by other politicians to take rivals out of parliament by a strange interpretation of the rules? Or an amendment? The power to prematurely and forcibly remove a member of the legislature is a *serious* power which needs to be thought about very carefully and probably best not done at all. 

Expenses problems are better sorted out by a proper reworking of the rules (as I understand, this was reviewed by a committee of MPs which brought the fine down from ~£40k to ~£6k because these expenses were made before the rules were changed), and then prosecuting those who go against these rules for fraud, as long as that is what it is.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Keeper- I think we need to invest in a backup. I don't know if Gomes is staying, Friedel will be 43. Who's next, Jordan Archer?

LB- I like Rose but we need depth. Depending on his form, BAE may be enough. Zeki probably could use a loan first before I trust him.

RB- I'd consider replacing Naughton.

CB- Need depth here. Kaboul is good but injury prone and I believe his contract runs out this summer. I like him but I'm not sure we should keep him. That would leave us with Dawson, Verts, Chiriches. I love Dawson and the day we sell him will be a dark day but I question keeping him if we want to continue playing a high line. I wouldn't mind bringing Caulker back if Cardiff go down. If we were to make a galactico purchase I think it should be here.

DM- I think we're fine here. Keep Capoue and Sandro. Maybe loan out Bentaleb. If we don't improve at CB we could probably use depth here, given that Capoue might have to slot back at CB and Sandro has been injury prone. 

Pure wingers: Lennon, Lamela, Townsend, Chadli. I like all of these players but we're a little tilted towards the right. I wouldn't mind adding a young prospect here, particularly one who can play on the left.

Other midfielders- We have Siggy, Holtby, Eriksen, Paulinho, Dembele. I think we should probably sell one of these players that isn't Eriksen. Tough to say because all of these players have their postives. I love Siggy but I think it's him, because I view his skill set as being the most redundant. Dembele has also been misused. I think as a pure attacking option he's individually great but seems to stifle our attack. I think he could potentially transition to DM. Tough guy and a great ballwinner, somebody you want fighting for possession in midfield.

Strikers: I seriously doubt we're bringing in anyone new without selling someone, and I don't think we'll sell anyone. We might sell Soldado but I don't see us improving there drastically.

Whether or not that 1974 claim is true, I have no idea, but I don't know that McGuinness today claims to be a member of a terrorist organisation.

No doubt there are members of the Nationalist community who have been injured or lost loved ones at the hands of Loyalist paramilitaries, the RUC and the British Army who will have just as much difficulty with McGuinness attending this function as Tebbit seems to have.

assuming you can, then my suggestion would be to look for a few funds (like the Vanguard series), where you can invest the money and let other people make the decisions about where to allocate it from that point onwards.  Hargreaves Lansdown are a popular provider, and there is a reason why they get recommended - i've started an ISA for my daughter recently and found them very easy to use.  

You may as well start investing right now to be honest.  look for funds that charge low fees, and have a read of what they invest in and what their rationale is - see if you think it makes sense.  it might be worth trying to invest some of the cash in funds with Eastern European exposure, it would mean that if the economy in Romania grows amazingly, then you can benefit from that growth (and maybe still buy a house if you ever want to move back there etc).  

in general, bear in mind that investing in riskier than savings in a bank account does expose you to the risk of losses.  i assume that you are fairly comfortable with that fact, but it is worth me repeating it anyway.

Especially in the context of the Heads of State of Ireland and the UK acknowledging the past while embracing the current good relationship between Ireland and the UK and looking to a bright future.  For additional context, the Queen had lost a cousin (and her husband lost an uncle) to an IRA attack.  For even more context President Higgins' father had fought in the Irish *Cogadh Na Saoirse* (War of Independence).

Incidentally, I wonder who the ""we"" he was referring to are.  Who else was he speaking for at that point?  Or should he have had the intellectual honesty to say ""I can but hope"" (that the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland will be shot in the back).

true,megasexdungeon,cnty-uk,💂 Sup,"All depends on the circumstances. If, however you are held in custody you will be given access to free legal advice which is in the form of a phone call to whatever duty solicitor is on call. If you are facing a custodial sentence, you will have a face-to-face conversation with the solicitor if you cannot afford one. All private legal advice before/after arrest will cost you money - although criminal lawyers aren't as expensive as civil lawyers. The vast majority of UK citizens go through their lives not requiring the services of a criminal lawyer, so although it may be a good idea to have a card in your wallet, you'll probably never need their services unless you're a wealthy, habitual criminal.

The argument for not speaking to police is similar to the US arguments against it. If you talk to them, you potentially give them ammunition to use against you/ convict you. You don't have to talk to the police, and the evidential burden is on them if you have done something wrong - if you talk to them it may make it easier for them to rely on something you've said in order to prosecute.

As with most things though, it's shades of grey. If you're facing accusations of a severe crime in the area of custodial sentencing, then it's never a good idea to speak to the police and have them prove you committed the crime. If it's a small infraction (say motoring offenses) then you may be better off apologising and being a decent individual as they have discretion to charge/ not to charge.

Liverpool is owned by a man who made his wealth trading commodities. Nobody considers Liverpool making their millions with commodities. 

Manchester United is owned by a family that specialises in taking over companies using leveraged debt, a strategy where all financial burden is placed on the company itself, effectively paying for its own takeover. 

For years, Real Madrid was propped up by endless loans from banks and the government. 

In all these cases, their ownership and source of finances have no bearing whatsoever, yet Manchester City, Chelsea and PSG are defined by the source of their owners' wealth? 

Last year, Chelsea's financial revenue was only around 20 million less than Liverpool. That shows gradual solvency. Manchester City was the world's 6th highest earning club in 2013. Their commercial revenue continues to grow and are very likely to make a profit within 5 years. An initial inflow of investment, followed by a period of sustained growth that finally results in profit over the course of a 5 to 10 year period is pretty standard business procedure. 

It seems now your problem (which keeps changing) is now no longer on any illusion of ""farcical business management"", but either on the fact that the clubs received financial investment from their new owners (which is 100% logical, by the way. It is almost customary for new owners following a takeover to provide heavy investment), or on the source of their wealth, or based on a doubt of their seriousness. 

For the first, are you saying that Liverpool would turn down a 100% free donation of 1 billion dollars from a random fan? Would the donation be rejected if the fan was found to be someone who earned his wealth through palm oil or solar panels? Is there, after so many years, any hint that Chelsea is a 'plaything' for Abramovic? With the continued investment in the community side of Manchester City, has there been any sign that Sheikh Mansour is not as committed to a holistic development of the club as he has claimed? 

It starts to sound like all your discontent is down to the typical elitism of the Old Guard, where if other clubs did not earn their success over lengthy periods of history where the financial and socio-economical climate was vastly different, they should never be allowed to enter anywhere close to the top today. After all, things like annual 30 million pound income for Champions League teams that further exarcebate the income inequality, and disproportionate TV deals in La Liga, as well as the support of FFP which will now virtually prevent any new team from ever entering the upper echelons of European football, are all absolutely fair and designed to encourage competition, yes?",0,1397062794,null,0,false,0,cgo6n7i,t3_22ja9y,t1_cgo6n7i,t1_cgo5k0k,null,1433280717,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Now do you spend those years giving them a really good knowledge of 'Itler and World War 2, or do you try and give them a broader look at the history of the culture most will spend the rest of their lives in?

I was saved by reading around the subject. I hated the early 20th century focus and my grades suffered, for me history was much more interesting the further back it went. Same with A levels, reading I, Claudius and Patrick O'Brian basically saved me from deciding never to study history again.

Anecdotally I remember very clearly seeing the teacher's face as we all submitted our proposed titles for our history GSCE coursework - WW2, WW2, WW1, WW2, WW1, WW2, WW2. Now those kids know basically - what? - Churchill was good, Hitler was bad, two world wars one world cup.

I want to address this specific point. Given our history, the culture we currently have and the culture the west likes to promote (freedom of the individual) I believe it's completely  ""UnBritish"" (hate that phrase) to imply we shouldn't allow people to build mosques, practice religion freely or speak their own languages.

true,therealmorris,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"So you mean that by choosing the 'group' that will vote, you influence the outcome?

You have to be practical with these things though.

Being reasonable, the largest sensible voting block on N. Ireland would be N. Ireland itself. You could say well why doesn't the whole UK vote, in which case you're inevitably skewing the outcome to the No response, as I imagine you would if the whole of Ukraine voted on Crimean independence or joining Russia as a whole. (Is this what you're saying?)

As far as the smallest grouping, you could keep on going down through the layers of governance but in my opinion the smallest reasonable alternative to a national (N Ireland) referendum would be based on counties (or rather unitary authorities, but that sort of scale). 

In that case you'd have to consider practicalities though, for example if only 1 or 2 border counties voted for independence/to join Ireland that's easy enough, you just move the border. If non-border areas did the same though you'd end up with Irish enclaves which could cause problems.

Additionally it's not as if N. Ireland is some arbitrary definition to suit anyone's interests in such an election, it has a devolved parliament and is considered a constituent country of the UK as one, I think both sides would agree on it voting as one. And this is democracy, it would be nice if everyone could choose individually, but at some point you have to say the majority rules, and I think N. Ireland as a whole is as good a ""self"" as any.

Again I think Scotland is a good example here, if, as I suggested, the referendum came about in a similar manner, where Scotland as a whole has elected an SNP government (on an independence platform), then I believe that's reasonable grounds for the same entity (Scotland) to vote on independence.",0,1397063293,null,0,1397063894,0,cgo6vse,t3_22jk5y,t1_cgo6vse,t1_cgo62rp,null,1433280828,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; Police have warned Stormont's deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, of a ""real and active"" threat against his life from dissident republicans, the Sinn Féin veteran has said.
&gt;
&gt; McGuinness said detectives had linked the sinister development to the politician's condemnation of a mortar bomb found in his native Derry on Sunday night and his associated statements of support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
&gt;

Do you think Tebbit teases many others about death threats they have received?  Or does he spare this ""nuanced"" mirth making just for those who have made the journey from armed resistance to political peace-making?  

At least [McGuinness isn't taking Tebbit too seriously](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/mcguinness-not-going-to-make-an-issue-of-tebbit-comments-627372.html).

true,mrmunchkin62,num9-away,,"&gt; IMO this whole eriksen playing on the left thing is a complete non-issue yet for basically no reason people keep going on about it

C'mon man. It's definitely an issue. Against Southampton I believe it was Lallana that put someone through twice because we were playing a high line and neither Rose or Eriksen closed him down. Against Sunderland, Rose had to do quite a bit of backtracking as well. Eriksen drifts in the middle, Rose gets into a crossing position, and our left flank is completely exposed. Sunderland just lacked the quality to make us pay. 

You say you wouldnt play him on the left against better teams- guess where Eriksen played against Liverpool? Do I have to remind you that it was Eriksen who was brushed off right outside the box and the Pool player put in a cross that Kaboul put in the back of our net? This is why the defensive lapse on the left is a problem: because we have it against all teams and some make us pay for it. 

So no, it's not a 'non-issue'.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"Its a shame because you sound like a smart person and I totally share your point of view, however you've bought into the narrative western media like to paint on the Muslim world to shift copy.  
Most Muslim nations are nothing like you describe. The sand people of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are historically fucking backwards people. I'm pretty sure they continued to pursue a nomadic lifestyle up until the ~1800s if not a bit later so to use them as a representation for the Muslim world is somewhat unfair.    

If anything it seems that your distaste is strongly based on whether a given society/culture has attained ""enlightenment"" yet. While this is the part I agree with you on to an extent it's a touch unfair to penalise them based on ""progress"" that we had a head start in. It's worth noting that for the west this was a process that began in approximately ~1600 and only in very recent years have we reached a point where atheism is a predominant belief.  So it took us about 400 years of which female emancipation only existed for the last 100.  
It is something that is going to take time but IMO will eventually happen in the Muslim nations as well, however the meddling by the West sets this back.  
Consider that for these ""backwards"" nations that religion still operates as a very strong political power much like it did in England prior to Henry VIII. When the west install or prop up a dictator that curbs political freedom (Saddam, the Shah or Saudi Arabia today) the peoples of the nation find refuge in religion as its the only power that can stand against the government.  

So with this in mind you're angry about a peoples for not being where we are when we used our advantage in this area (sciences!) to intentionally hold back the other nations and plunder their natural resources. We will need to give them time to get religion out of their system without our meddling.  

If you follow recent Middle Eastern history its totally understandable how terrorism has ""become a thing"". The betrayal following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the unyielding support of Israel. You may recall that 9/11 was a revenge attack for the Israeli bombing of Lebanon.  
Much like how compelling the Western narrative is that these people are barbarians the Middle Eastern narrative that the west are ""infidels"" is also a compelling one because history shows that we haven't treated the Middle East with a fair hand at all. Therefore its totally understandable how people end up at these questionable conclusions. It's undesirable but it still makes a certain sense.

However its worth noting that I completely support your aims in the UK. Please champion European values in that we strive for freedom and liberty for all races, sexes, sexual orientations and such like. Please oppose any misguided attempts by immigrants to bring unwelcome values (like Sharia law) to these lands. However at the same time please broaden your horizons to also include Middle Eastern narratives. These narratives I hope will provide you with the perspective to accept these people for who they are as opposed to just vehemently disliking them. Eventually their children will be people that our children can finally respect.

&gt; I don't expect to go to the Middle East and set up churches

The Middle East is home to Christian churches as well as Mosques. Muslims have historically been incredibly tolerant of other religions.

Don't get me wrong I fucking hate it too but I don't see great results in our previous attempts to ""civilize"" the ""barbarians"". It feels to me like its something that a society has to cure itself as opposed to us attempting to micro-manage the situation from afar (which often results in the opposite result that we desire).  
An example of this might be India with their recent realisation that there are a ton of rapists in their country. This is a country that used to be even more backwards in regards to sexism than the Middle East (look up sati).

I think if we're going to do anything then the best thing is to create culture that is accessible by the Middle East (e.g. Arabic) that is good enough to be popular and also contains strong Western values.

Christianity is pretty barbaric and a lot of Jews in Israel use religion to justify some pretty poor behaviour. If I was religious I would be pretty embarrassed by my church's behaviour.

As Odys has commented on, the people in a lot of these countries have been fucked over by a western friendly government that has done nothing to help them. They are typically uneducated and will look for someone to blame for their predicament. Islam can teach a purer way of life and points the finger of blame at infidels. A parallel in this country is the way if the GDP drops a little, the BNP/EDL/etc gain popularity as the equivalent UK people will blame immigration for the lack of jobs and pressures on welfare even though the situation is a lot more complex.

The press bias that you talk about, is not something that I can relate to. Remember the asian sex gangs, they were British and there was another white sex gang exposed at the same time but the 'Asian' sex gang got a lot more press attention. If you feel strongly about this please start reading the DM or Sun as they can help you with this. If a criminal isn't white you will see it repeatedly mentioned in the report. 

The burqa is stupid, there's no denying that. It's a combination a one-upmanship in terms of piety and cultural domination by men. It won't last long. Just remember we fought a war in Afghanistan to give women the right to not wear a burqa so surely we can also give people in this country the right to wear one if they want to. If I want to wear one I can, and I'm glad I live a country where I am able to.

There are multiple churches in Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan, etc. I admit I normally hear about them when they are attacked but they do exist.

I've been to Spain where many ex-English live. No of them speak Spanish, I even saw an estate agent with all the signage and property details in English. An urdu estate agent in this country wouldn't last too long.

If the club drew AM it wouldn't be *that* stupid if he was allowed to play against Chelsea. I actually recall Mourinho speaking about this during the Quarter Finals draw and saying he'd allow Courtois to play against us.

What looks worse? 

Chelsea playing against their current on loan keeper (who has been at Atletico for 3 years  now) in the CL Semi Finals? 

or

Chelsea refusing to allow Atletico Madrid to use their first choice goalkeeper for the past three years (who happens to be owned by Chelsea) in the CL Semi Finals?

The latter can be construed in as many was as the press wants. Aside from the prospect of barring Atletico from using their first choice Chelsea loanee goalkeeper being an absolute PR nightmare, it also looks like a cheap way to grab an advantage over a team at a critical juncture of play.

I can see where you're coming from about Morientes but I think it's a bit of a different situation.

Personally I'm not a massive fan of such action. When you're dealing with the world stage you need to abstract your values to find places where you can find agreement.  
A great example would be Russia. We can all agree that Russia is pretty fucked up, however we import gas and oil from them irrespective of their terrible human rights records and lack of political freedom.  
However the moment they start playing with values that are relevant given an international perspective and start fucking with the sovereignty of other nations, that's when you start bringing in the sanctions.

I.E. it's our business as a nation state and part of the UN to protect the borders of nation states. However it is not our business to tell other countries that they need to behave like us within their internal borders.  

IMO There is political power and cultural power and I don't think the solution to this sort of thing lies in the political arena, if anything I see that as counter productive. An example would be how AckMyDinnerJacket managed to use the sanctions on Iran as political gold to buoy up his ratings when he was otherwise massively despised by most Iranians.

The whole reason is so that MPs can (theoretically) back long term policies which may be unpopular and have time for them to work rather than being constantly under threat of being recalled.

A parliament where MPs can be recalled at any time for any reason would most likely be paralysed and unable to make any big decisions. 

In this specific case I don't think an immediate by-election is a sensible route, people are likely to vote in protest (which is precisely why Farage wants one) and not think through their choice beyond being angry about the current situation. Its highly unlikely the conservative replacement would win, even if they would under ordinary circumstances at the upcoming general election.

true,TheGidbinn,null,null,"These changes are strange. Broadening the curriculum doesn't magically make more teaching hours, it just means that the knowledge of students and the time of teachers is going to be spread thinner.

The idea of more maths in physics is good, but the reason that A-level physics only really uses GCSE maths (with some exponents\logs thrown in) is so that exam boards and teachers don't have to worry whether or not their students have learned the necessary maths yet. I feel like there's going to be problems down the line with this one.

I very much hope that they're not planning on inserting actual 'cutting-edge' material into GCSE science. Most physics undergrads are baffled by it. It would be more valuable to build up a sensible base of newtonian physics, thermodynamics and electromag (much like the current syllabus does), because you can do a lot of those things just with GCSE-level maths. Wait, I forgot, this reform isn't about helping kids understand things. 

I'm on the fence about removing practicals from physics. A lot of people are saying it's bad, but I think the practicals themselves were awfully-designed and didn't really teach you any of the practical skills you needed. Plus, some students might be pursuing theoretical physics, so their choice university might not care too much if they didn't do well at their experiements.

I'm skeptical of the claim that making exams harder will improve standards of education, and also of the claim that exams are easier than they used to be. I've looked through O-level maths papers and they don't seem to be any more difficult than the ones I took, they just encompass a broader spectrum of topics in less detail.

true,InitiumNovum,irish,Ireland,"Norman Tebbit's feelings are absolutely understandable, given that Martin McGuinness was one of those who would have made the decision to carry out the Brighton Bombing (given that he had a high rank in the PIRA), an attack which left Tebbit's wife permanently disabled. 

McGuinness probably also ordered the assassination of Lord Mountbatten, who was Prince Philip's uncle and also related to the Queen, so naturally inviting McGuiness is a difficult affair for the Royal Family too. 

Personally, I don't think he should have been invited at all, terrorists, even former ones, should not be given public attention, especially if they never apologised to the families of the victims for their actions. If you were involved in such atrocities that legacy should stick with you for the rest of your life without any pardon, it doesn't matter if you hold a high elected political office or not. I can only imagine that having McGuiness there would serve as an insult to those killed IRA attacks in Britain, and consequently his presence might actually have an affect on Anglo-Irish relations contrary to what might have been intended. 

Frankly I'm shocked that the British are inviting him, but at the same time it's not so shocking given how Britain is reaching so leniently to agent provocateurs like Anjem Choudary or Abu Qatada.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Christianity has evolved because in free-speech societies it has been the subject of relentless and powerful criticism.   It didn't just improve by itself - it faced challenges from modern science, from intellectuals and from all sorts of people who made reasonable arguments as to why things should change.

I'm not claiming that similar improvements can't be made with Muslims, but in order to do so we need to be able to relentlessly criticize Islam just like we criticize any other ideology.  We need to preserve free speech and we need to speak out about the problems inherent to their religion.  Just like we did with Christianity.

Many Christians today are more tolerant essentially because they no longer believe in the Bible.  Biblical literalism is now often regarded as an insult instead of a virtue.  They've given up seeing it as a book containing the literal truth about the world and instead think of it as a collection of stories - conveniently skipping over the bad stories or willfully ignoring the actual intended meanings of the verses.  

And that's what needs to happen with Islam.  We need Muslims to turn away from taking their religion seriously.  We need them to treat the Quran as metaphor instead of Allah's divine word.  In short - we need Muslims to become less religious.

Religion is like smoking.  Not everyone who smokes will develop lung cancer, but the less you smoke, the healthier you will be.  Some of us have cut out cigarettes completely, but right now we're at the stage where the best we can do is to encourage most people to limit their consumption.

I realised that A) I wasn't getting the full experience by being a neutral for every match (although I still loved watching the game), and that B) you didn't have to be from a city to support that city's team.

That second point is really important for me, since I'm from Bristol and all the teams round here are utter shite. The best ""local"" team is Yeovil Town, who are currently rock bottom in the Championship, where they've been all season. Swindon Town, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers are all League 1 or worse.

I was really attracted to their former glory, and the fact they had never won the PL. I thought that if they ever were to win the league again, I wanted in on that amazing feeling.

How about you accept the mirror of society instead of trying to blot out the parts you don't like?  
It's _natural_ to be racist, we're tribal people and this multi-cultural city business is effort. Those that are not blessed with the experience of growing up around other cultures will naturally distrust them and form poor conclusions due to their lack of inexperience and/or a racist influence in their early life. While I dislike this outcome I personally don't dislike these specific people because I can appreciate how they ended up with this shonky conclusion.  

Right now being racist and white is a very strong taboo in UK culture. A racist speaking in the public arena will likely be shouted down and not even afforded the respect to complete their shambles of a sentence.  

IMO we need to be more tolerant of racists, accept they exist, let them air their views BUT THEN counter their views with facts and rationalisation. Find ways to broaden their perspective and throw off their racism.  

At present we're demonising without curing and personally I don't think that's a good idea. We're getting pretty close to making racism illegal (our hate crime laws) and I personally think that's a dangerous road to walk down. We shouldn't replace the legitimate, straight-forward reasons why racism is actually bad with the simplification that just racism = bad.

As an example we all need to be experienced with discussing that IQ test bollocks (which racists will often put forth as a rationale) because if we allow future generations to not be experienced with this debate they'll be unable to counter the bullshit arguments with logic and logic is much more compelling than social pressure and stands the test of time (until its simplified into social pressure.... noes!!!!).",1,1397070314,null,0,1397070577,0,cgoac22,t3_22mb50,t1_cgoac22,t1_cgoa5ch,null,1433282467,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt; ""There's always the possibility that a member of the Real IRA will be so outraged by Mr McGuinness bowing to the Queen that they might shoot him in the back for it. We can but hope.""

You tried making a distinction here, but glad to see you've abandoned this one.  

Given the somewhat obtuse and ""nuanced"" euphemistic manner in which politicians like to speak, where ""consider his position"" really means ""resign"", where ""with the greatest possible respect"" really means ""with no respect at all"" and where ""serious consequences"" really means ""invasion and conquest"" it's not unreasonable to interpret Tebbit's ""hope"" for the murder of McGuinness as a goading of dissident Republicans and a call on the Real IRA to kill him. 

However anyone tries to defend this as a flippant remark it ought not to be acceptable for a member of either house of Parliament to jokingly wish that another politician be murdered, let alone the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, on official business in Windsor Castle, where the progress in the Northern Irish peace process is being recognised.  McGuinness has done more to bring peace to Northern Ireland than Tebbit ever did.  Peace will prevail in spite of him.
