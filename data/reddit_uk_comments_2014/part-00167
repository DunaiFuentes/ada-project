Also, as far as tackling goes, [this article is good, although a few months old](http://eplindex.com/49789/ramires-underrated-chelsea-midfield.html). 77% tackle success rate is very good, but Ramires' main ball winning skill are his interceptions, as the article shows. That's because he has very good defensive reading of the game, and is brilliant with his positioning in defence. 

For me, the main issues with his game are technically, but in a midfield next to somebody like Matic or Fabregas, that would become less important, so the only players we should look at to replace him are ones that can match his work rate and defensive contribution, whilst also being more versatile going forward. It was my opinion when I wrote my original Ramires defence that Modric is the only player in the world who could do that, and his performances in the last few months have only solidified my opinion.

Southsea is either too posh, therefore expensive or Student bedsit land. Big 100 year old house split in to flats with god know who living above or below you, in other words not Southsea! 

Something to consider is at your price range you could be renting a house. OK the house is not going to be very big but you will have your own front door and yard at the back for BBQ in the summer, a shed for your bike. Along with two bedrooms and room to swing a cat.

Baffins/Tangiers road area would be real nice but a little expensive, but Copnor road with the many roads leading off it should be more affordable.

&gt;Do you understand what these do

I believe so, my investment in these funds should perform close to the markets they are trying to replicate

&gt;and how

Not yet, no. Presumably your point is to highlight I'm not making a sound investment choice if I don't understand how it works and thus any risks or pitfalls besides wider market performance?

&gt;the bits of the market you're missing out on

I believe so, i.e. in those two examples, I'm mainly missing out on everything outside of the UK and US markets?

&gt;What is the goal with the money? Are you looking for retirement savings or are you likely to dip in and out of the money?

The goal with the money is to do something with it other than have it sitting in my 0.1% interest bank account, and I don't plan on needing the money any time soon. The only time I've ever dipped into savings is for a mortgage deposit, and a subsequent re-mortgage to improve my LTV for a better mortgage package.

&gt;It's very easy to destroy your wealth by diving into investments/financial plans that you don't understand.

Understood. I wouldn't invest what I wasn't able to lose (losing £15,000 for example is, whilst a significant amount, not something that would greatly effect me in the long run).

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Yes in the fact that Islam is an inferior set of laws, values and practices when compared to British laws, values and practices.

I know (again, this is anecdote, so pointless, but I'm sure if you have any muslim friends, you'll know it too) that there are a lot of muslims out there who have hold stronger values and are more respectful and well rounded individuals than a good portion of the British native population.

To me, an atheist/pantheist/agnostic/""religion is generally more harm than good"", I have a huge amount of respect for the muslims I know. I'm my experience of developed Arabic countries, there is often far less crime than here, people are more polite to each other than here and the people there are generally happier than here. So with regards to a a good section of law, practices and value, in my opinion and experience, they're not inferior at all! But we both clearly have a different idea in our heads and different associations when we think of Islam.

And that's the central point of my argument: people judging all muslims based on what they think Islam is. I'm not claiming I know islam any better than other people, that's exactly why I don't go round saying one is inferior to the other.

The author is saying Islam is inferior because a few incidents of people who follow Islam doing questionable things (and I'll agree, they are questionable things) but to apply the conclusions from the actions of the few to an entire religion is, by definition, racist.

&gt; However, this doesn't translate to all Muslims, nor do I think the author implies this.

The article clearly implies the author thinks Islam is not equal to the rest, given the tone, I don't think it's a leap to assume author was implying it was subordinate. By saying ""islam is inferior"" they're saying all those who follow it, in whatever way, are also inferior.

The headline makes a sweeping generalisation about an entire religion based on a few bad apples. I'm not saying this just out of defence of Islam, I would hold the same issue if the author implied all of Christianity was inferior because of the behaviour of the West Bro Baptist church.

&gt; The more 'moderate' ones are still teaching an inferior value system to presumably thousands of students each year

You're assuming they're teaching islam so it must be inferior. How do you know they're not teaching the parts of islam which agree with christianity, things like ""be good to one another"" and ""don't drink or do drugs"" and such? You don't. You're just assuming.

Another school teaching Christianity could also be said to be inferior, because some christians (West Bro Baptists) behave in an inferior way by your logic. Christianity teaches the bible, and there's some pretty horrific stuff in there too y'know, but that doesn't mean all Christianity is evil - same applies to Islam.",0,1402586459,null,0,false,0,ci5pulq,t3_27xcus,t1_ci5pulq,t1_ci5n8m4,null,1434207207,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That is entirely true, I should have made it clearer I was just offering an alternative way the data could be interpreted - it's not necessarily true, but it illustrates there are other ways it can be read, each way as valid as the next but all unable to be proven.

&gt; We know two facts, gun crime was lower when our gun laws were less restrictive. Why? I don't know but it does show the two can exist, they already have.

Gun crime was lower, but still not 0. Again, you're pointing to a correlation and saying there must be causation. It could have been that when there was looser gun laws, there was also a relatively smaller amount of guns in the world, making them hard to come buy and more expensive. You're right, we don't know.

So I'll say again, one thing we do know, and we can say for 100% certainty is that gun crime, by definition, can't happen without guns. We can speculate that if handguns are illegal, they're harder to acquire (again, this is speculation - some claim certain illegal drugs are easier to acquire than alcohol if you're under 18). Therefore, we can speculate that if handguns are illegal, there is an explainable method which can reduce gun crime.

so far, nobody has managed to provide a method through which legalising handguns would reduce crime, other than ""look at the crime statistics"" which is effectively saying ""look, correlation, must be causation!""

I'm aware that the UK authorities aren't in control of drug use, and also that it isn't hard to get hold of drugs, but I don't see how legalisation - increasing the ease of getting drugs and having them be sold by the government - is going to either limit drug use, provide a feasible solution to addiction, or even give the government control over the market/their monopoly on the drug. 

I can't even begin to consider how this thinking could be beneficial in the slightest, unless the aim is to just take a laissez-faire view on the matter and hope it sorts itself out (and we know how well *that* has worked with other things in the past).",1,1402588064,null,0,false,0,ci5qmjt,t3_27yk10,t1_ci5qmjt,t1_ci5pq4i,null,1434207573,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Really? Lallana has spent only two seasons of his career so far playing top-flight football, compared to over a decade for Fabregas (and for teams at the top end of the table). Go back only 12 or 18 months and basically nobody rated Lallana as a quality player. Meanwhile Fabregas was a key first XI player for Barca while they were pretty much the top club side in the world, and for a Spain side that won two Euros and a World Cup. 

I'm not going to argue whether Fabregas is a much *better* player, but he's objectively more accomplished. You're comparing a guy who has captained Arsenal, has played in nearly 100 Champions League games including a final, won La Liga, FA Cup, World Cup, European Championships... comparing him with someone who has yet to play European football at a club level and only four seasons ago was playing in League One. It's not a contest. 

That said, different transfers are different. You're always going to pay more when the selling club don't want to sell.

I fail to see the part in the story that indicates that she accidentally took the incorrect strain. What about in the circumstance that she took the designated dosage in the assumption it would provide a greater thrill? In that case, it points to the obvious - greater drug education, not necessarily legislation.

&gt; It wouldn't stop a deliberate overdose, but a reliable product would prevent this sort of accident.

I can't even begin to imagine what a ""reliable product"" would be in this sense, or how it would differ from its black market counterpart. It's hardly a typical commodity.

&gt; Also, if it were legal, her friends would probably have called for help faster - and all the effort that goes into developing legal highs might actually go into designing safer drugs.

On the basis that the stigma of the drug would be removed, and the people wouldn't have to worry about the deterrent of actions being blatantly illegal?

On that note, as often as its claimed, I find it pretty naive when people assume that the marginal amount of extra money the state gains from selling the drug legally would be allocated to drug prevention.

2) Play into the strengths of our forwards.  The quicker they get the ball with fewer people between them and goal the better the outcome.

People act stupid with alcohol as well, and it is a drug that can be used for similar reasons, socialising, partying ect. Look at the high street on a Friday night, look at how many people there will have drunk too much. Do those people have the self control to take MDMA responsibly? 

If MDMA was legalised, it would be used by the same people who enjoy going out and getting black out drunk. People are warned of the dangers of alcohol and 9000 a year still die as a result.

On the price front: Let's go high end and say Cesc makes £5M more per year. With a £26.5M transfer and £150k/week wages that would be £57.7M for four years, which I think is a fair number of seasons to hope to get from someone at 26-27 years old. By the same measures Lallana would be about £36M for four years (at £54k/week). That means Cesc would be 60% more expensive for a four year commitment assuming no re-negotiations (which seemingly never happens).

As /u/severedfragile mentioned ""Lallana is arguably a better fit for what we need."" I would pay a little more for something I *need* rather than something that I *don't need* (i.e. Cesc for Chelsea - with all their midfielders - is a luxury purchase; Whereas Lallana would be a welcome addition to our team).

I think Rodgers has identified Lallana as a player that will help our team continue progressing forward and if the rumors are to be believed then we had already valued Lallana at around £20-25m and I think that's still a fair price.

All that being said, I think the Cesc transfer fee could help us at the negotiating table for the very reasons you mentioned:

&gt;He's almost exactly one year older than Adam Lallana, plays a similar position, and I think everyone can agree he's a MUCH more accomplished player.

The media is suggesting that we increased our bid from £20 to £25 but I don't really see any indication that we have *officially* placed that bid.

Some of the allure of drugs is the taboo, and addiction can stem from trying to hide your habit. Legalisation would take away the 'bad boy' image, and allow people to be open about their usage. Addicts won't often seek help because of the social stigma, so they self medicate and the addiction gets worse.

Yeah, yeah, whatever, I won't be repeating myself for the 100th time.

&gt; you want to argue against the GMC

Why not?

&gt;Your 'argument' is going from weaker to weaker still. It was already inconsistent

From your personal point of view, which obviously can't agree to me as then you would be at fault and you are Mr Perfect, who is always right.

&gt;The point still stands and you again fail to acknowledge anything which would prove you wrong with anything you say.

&gt;Yet the GMC are actively screaming that there's a risk to patients because they can't validate.

I've already said what I wanted in relation to that.

&gt;You accept that there's lower standards

I haven't admitted that there are definitely lower standards in any EU countries in relation to level of teaching at medical universities.

&gt;The GMC themselves raise the alarm that they can't be sure of EU standardisation. That it might be putting their patients at risk.

And if they think that such is real, they can scream,push or whatever the EU towards making sure that those standards do exist.

&gt;the regulatory body is saying that they don't have full power of control.

In connection with non-EU countries.

&gt;But under their own steam, the UK and the NHS, they COULD, and hold whatever standards they seem fit

And they keep such high standards and control of non-EU doctors, which have very high number of being struck-off the register.

That basically means that other than scream about the issue which quite possibly doesn't exist in the EU, they should first make sure they are doing good control of standards from non-EU.

In fact, I would even follow your and others (including GMC) way of thought, and invest heavily in medical education in the UK, so that there are more UK doctors and with time reduce numbers of doctors from those non-EU countries, which have percentage of struck off higher than average as that is indeed putting patient's lives at risk, NOT EU doctors, who according to current information, don't have such high percentage, even though they ARE NOT under full GMC control as you repeat it so much.

P.S. Remember when Farage said current guns ban is stupid as it was based on panic, rather than actual data research (which could prove whether the ban in fact changes anything in number of gun-related crimes)? It's very similar with the above discussion - but don't get me wrong, I'm assuming things, I haven't looked at details myself and in fact prefer having gun-ban as higher proportion of guns means more deadly weapons available to be used.",0,1402590321,null,0,false,0,ci5row3,t3_27m2id,t1_ci5row3,t1_ci55djx,null,1434208143,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The government actually put a lot of money in to the system.  It helps get money to small businesses whilst avoiding the banks. 

Zopa is easier in that you just put the money in and it does everything else. Funding circle allows you to select borrowers, set interest rates etc.

I don't think anyone's freedom to do it should be infringed, and gay rights is more about freedom than harm - the harm aspect is clearly scaremongering because being gay is not something that will harm you.

These drugs, on the other hand, are. So I was sort of edging on the side that given how few sane people would take something after a certain point (let's take it a step further and say meth or bath salts) the harm you'd end up doing to people who would rather not have ended up addicted to these things will probably massively outweigh the 1 or 2 people who actually took it out of an informed choice.

Not really saying I know where to draw the line, though - I'm no expert in drugs so many heroin could fall on either side, but at some point having certain things legal and available for sale will bite you in the ass, I can almost guarantee it.

Also, it's worth considering that some drugs can lead to you eating another persons face - so maybe we should be drawing analogies with the dangers of legalising the sale of dangerous weapons such as guns, rather than homosexuality!

* many British are fake and dishonest, they'll lie to your face, and won't apologise

Never make a deposit to a landlord without seeing the place and seeing the landlord.

All deposits must, by law, be registered with an external regulatory body which you can double-check online. When inspecting a rental for the first time WRITE DOWN EVERY SCRATCH YOU FIND - take 30 - 60 minutes inspecting. Trust me, it isn't worth rushing the move-in inspection just to have 900 pounds' worth of deposit taken away because the landlord suddenly decided the place needed an entire makeover.

true,canyoufeelme,null,null,"&gt; A lot of the debate (which is a generous view) around this topic seems to be hampered by post-Imperial guilt: even if we thought at the time our form of life was superior it was morally reprehensible to force anyone into it, and even more so to march into a country and force a small ruling elite people into it and fundamentally screw over everyone else.

I don't think it's ""imperial guilt"" so much as it is an acknolwedgment as to *why* people are coming to the Europe and the US and other countries. The countries where immigrants come from (Pakistan for example) are troubled countries and former UK colonies with bad economy and job opportunity and stability. 

They are troubled, to some degree, because of imperialism and the borders drawn up by the British without any consideration of tribes and such. 

So it's not saying *feel guilty for what your country did*, it's just highlighting how these war torn countries came to be, and why there are so many immigrants and asylum seekers. It's simply acnowledging the root of the problem. Our economies were built on slavery and imperalism, and these things went on for hundreds of years. It's foolish to think that because slavery ended 200 years ago, it means slavery no longer shapes our world. This is simply not true. It's  not about ""white guilt"" or whatever, it's about ackowledging that things like slavery and imperalism aren't actually over, because they continue to shape the landscapes of our world in a big way, and the effects of these things are still felt, immigration is just one of them.

The stickers are ignoring what the Dutch, the Danish, the Germans have known for a while. Separate haulage from cycles physically. Putting haulage back on rail is another strategy well used - less traffic jams and less late delivery.

&gt;Being quintessentially English myself , what makes us seem rather aloof and superior to the natives is being nothing of the kind.....it's just that we aren't so excitable about the most trivial of things that seem to inordinately excite our colonial friends. It's just that we are not so bothered about ""face"" when confronted by others determined to cause us problems abroad. Long may we remain calm and ""superior"".

and stuff like this.

&gt;It's not just education and school management that Muslims are infiltrating - they have a well-thought through strategic plan to become integral in many areas of Govt both central and local. Housing Depts in all of our major cities have been targeted by Muslims for employment , some of these Metropolitan authorities having already been victims of housing scams by these Muslims eg. Tower Hamlets , but you can bet your bottom dollar this will be endemic in Birmingham , Bradford et al. The Border Agency is also another favourite for targeted employment by Muslims.....anywhere that can be infiltrated to dilute any response/overt action against Muslims. None of this is by chance . Just as the Trojan Horse Muslims organised quite deliberately their take-over of schools , so other Trojan Horse hard-liners will be infiltrating other Govnt. Agencies to effect and implement policies and approaches sympathetic to Islam. Islam in this country is well-organised , well-funded and driven by committed hard-line fundamentalists who see all our institutions as targets vulnerable to take-over using our democratic values to achieve their aims. We had better wake up soon to the fact that a cultural war is upon us.....that the enemy within understands the mechanisms which run our country both centrally and locally.....and that they have a game plan which is nothing less than the cementing of Islam as an integral and dominant theology within every area of Govnt of our democracy......with the eventual aim of destroying that democracy and subverting it to the aims of Islam. We have all been warned...we have all seen the evidence before our own eyes of what is happening......the question is do we sit back and let them succeed or start the overhaul of our democratic institutions to protect ourselves from this attack . **Personally I never deal with Muslims whenever I have dealings with Govnt agencies of any kind and demand to speak to someone of my own community......I never do any business with any Muslim-owned business of any kind......I would never vote for any Muslim candidate in whatever vote was taking place in my city of Bristol.**.....I take every opportunity of highlighting the increasing criminality of Muslim communities in my city in whatever newspaper comment section I can......all of this a very small contribution towards the fight back........but multiplied by millions of other concerned citizens we might have a chance. Think about it.

Oh I highly doubt that. 

&gt;I think as long as they aren't teaching anything illegal, you aren't going to be able to stop the religious teaching their religion to their kids.

Teaching false facts like ""homosexuality is a learned behaviour"" might not be illegal, but it should be. How is it any different to me starting a private school and teaching kids whatever bullshit I like such as ""the moon is made of cheese and climate change is a conspiracy"". 

It is not preparing them for the REAL world and it's setting them up for constant clashes with other people. It's destructive to society and intellectually stunts children and leaves them uprepared to deal with the real world and the people that inhabit it.  

How'd you like it if I started a private school and ""promoted"" homosexuality as a faith? You'd flip, but apparently Christian schools teaching bullshit to kids is fine with you. 

Why are you ok with schools teaching bullshit to kids? I don't mean ""teaching their religion"" either, I mean teaching cetified bullshit that is false like creationsism and that crap about being gay. There's a difference between teaching kids your religion, and teaching them outright insidious lies and false facts. If your ""religion"" happens to have false facts in it, then your religion doesn't belong in school. You can live in delusion if you want, it's your life, but your delusion does not belong in a cirriculum. 

Wanna know why your religion is dead in this country and people have no respect for Christians? This is why. You're fine with teaching bullshit to kids, no matter how much it might fuck them up, because of your selfish devotion to your 2000 year old plagiaraized propaganda manual. 

You value your ""faith"" over what is right and that is why your Churches are being converted into boots franchises and night clubs.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; These comments always miss the point - a girl died after taking almost-pure ecstasy and, even if legalised, it likely would not have prevented her from taking such a pure strain.

I don't think you know much about what you're talking about. Illegal drugs have *unknown dosages* because the drug traders cut them with other chemicals. This means if you switch dealer, or your dealer switches dealer, or anyone makes any change anywhere in the supply chain, you don't know if you're getting the same dosage you got last time. This leads to accidental overdosing, even if you're being careful and using the amount you usually use.

MDMA is quite safe at the correct dosage.

Would you feel confident using paracetamol if it were a gamble what dosage you were getting? What about if you weren't sure whether that alcoholic drink you were about to consume were 4% ABV or 20%?

&gt; When someone can get cheap cocaine at the local cornershop, 

Drugs legal =/= all drugs available dirt cheap at every corner shop with no regulation. All it means is that you won't get punished by the government for possessing drugs. There are myriad ways of controlling supply. After all, there are many abuseable pharmaceuticals which do not carry charges for possession, but are still tightly controlled. Free markets would also be a potentially catastrophic policy with some drugs, but so too is prohibition. There is a middle ground, and it must take into account the individual harms and risks of each drug, as well as the reasons and habits of the people who use them.

MDMA for instance is primarily used at rave parties. Addiction is extremely rare; the majority of users are infrequent users. All drugs are more risky when mixed with other drugs. So a potentially good model would perhaps be to have licensed rave parties where other substances are banned and the staff are all trained to recognise the symptoms of an overdose or another harmful side effect. Many harmful side effects would be reduced by the absence of other chemicals, anyway. 

Cannabis could probably be safely sold in shops or in licensed venues. Psychedelics could be sold in special pharmacies by experts.

I freely admit that the most difficult drugs to fit into any regulatory model are things like heroin, crack cocaine, and crystal meth. Abuse is the norm, and addiction prevents users making rational decisions about their use (this just in: most drug users, just like most alcohol drinkers, make rational decisions about their use). Making them legal to possess reduces harm at home. Making them illegal to supply might make them harder to get hold of, but make them more dangerous if people do, and will do nothing to help the plight of those in the third world who are daily terrorised by drug barons.

&gt;  I don't see by any logic how that is possibly going to solve anything, except for having the funding in the hands of the state to reinvest in an increased military budget while people are intoxicated off their heads.

This is already the case. People use and abuse alcohol. Alcohol is just as dangerous and toxic as most illegal drugs, and in terms of inciting violence and anti-social behaviour it is unmatched. However, *most* alcohol users are sensible and safe, as are *most* cannabis users, MDMA users, users of psychedelics, and a good portion of cocaine users.

&gt; You can tell this is the top comment every time a drug story comes up - ""Fuck this shit, just legalise/decriminalise everything and we'll have no problems, and everything will be perfect. Liberalism, y'know, we should be able to have the choice to have a safe and constant supply of drugs instead of having to jump through hoops to get dodgy goods"".

I don't think anybody thinks that. Drugs are harmful, there is no doubt about it, whether regulated or prohibited. They are also, for most humans throughout all history, a part of life. That's why it's important to regulate. Regulation won't cure all drug harms, but it'll do a damn better job than prohibition.

As for 'legalise them all', I think this is a sensible goal, but it would absolutely have to be a slow process, regulating one drug at a time, otherwise the nightmare 'free-for-all' scenario would almost certainly occur.",0,1402593906,null,0,false,0,ci5thus,t3_27yk10,t1_ci5thus,t1_ci5pk4w,null,1434208994,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

If all doctors and nurses were to report things like this then all you'd find is that the victims of it become completely segregated from the health service by the same social pressures that drive the practice in the first place. I personally think it makes sense. Education is needed to actually end these barbaric acts and what better place to preach it than in a health centre? 

In terms of government ineptness, it probably took that FoI request for someone to pull the figures together for the first time.

The term is mainly used when referencing the difference between publicly maintained or adopted 'highway' &amp;amp; privately owned land (which can also include roads, footpaths &amp;amp; verges). 

The distinction is very important to utility companies including water, gas, electricity, telecoms etc who have certain rights as statutory undertakers to put apparatus within the public highway, but require a wayleave or easement (which usually cost money) in privately owned land. Privately owned land can belong to a public body (for example a local authority), but is not designated public highway.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Oh I highly doubt that.

you doubt a parent who sends their kid to a private, fee-paying, 20-kid strong evangelical christian school doesn't know what they're learning? 

&gt; Teaching false facts like ""homosexuality is a learned behaviour"" might not be illegal, but it should be

teaching it should be illegal, or saying it should be? where do you draw the line? if it's said within earshot of a kid? 

&gt; How is it any different to me starting a private school and teaching kids whatever bullshit I like such as ""the moon is made of cheese and climate change is a conspiracy"".

well first you'd have to get parents who agreed with you to sign up and pay you to send their kids to your school (otherwise you'd have no kids to teach). then you'd have to teach a broad curriculum as they do, even if you throw in some unconventional views here and there. and of course you'd have to pass the ofsted inspections, as they do, with all that entails. but if you want to have at it, be my guest. 

&gt; How'd you like it if I started a private school and ""promoted"" homosexuality as a faith? You'd flip, but apparently Christian schools teaching bullshit to kids is fine with you.

erm, I think you should be free to teach whatever you like, as long as it's done in full knowledge of parents, and paid for privately, with proper regulation. I wouldn't flip at all. there are all kinds of groups who run schools who teach kids all kinds of things I think are nonsense. I don't want them shut down. 

&gt;  There's a difference between teaching kids your religion, and teaching them outright insidious lies and false facts. 

the disconnect is this; for the christians/muslims/jews/other people who disagree with you; there are not 'insidious lies' - they are genuinely held beliefs. they are not telling kids something they know to be false; they are passing on what they believe. and whether that happens at these private schools or in their private homes, you can be sure it will continue. parents teach their kids what they believe. unless you want to take kids off all religious parents (which wouldn't surprise me at this point) - you're simply wasting your breath. 

&gt; Wanna know why your religion is dead in this country and people have no respect for Christians? This is why. You're fine with teaching bullshit to kids, no matter how much it might fuck them up, because of your selfish devotion to your 2000 year old plagiaraized propaganda manual.

In any case, you can't say that Lallana is anywhere near Fab in terms of pedigree and legacy of being a top player. What only some people seem to realize is that Lallana is still a pretty big gamble at £25 million. Yes, he has had a good season or two, but he's not proven it as much or as long as Fabregas had. Yes, Fab's wages are much higher, and he would cost more. But I do think the deal shines a bit of a light on Lallana's true worth.

More importantly, this deal illustrates the market for top players for relatively low transfer fees that we ought to be involved in.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt; If you want to ban alcohol, and I can see why you might, presumably you think all drugs have no place in our society? In a perfect world, with equal opportunities for all, I might agree with that. 
&gt; [...] 
&gt; Is it a problem for me to occasionally escape my normal reality and spend a few hours without care, worry, or stress? Is it morally wrong for those with frankly unbrarable lives to seek this release too?

Don't get me wrong, I understand the entire motivation behind drug use as a form of escapism, but as you say yourself, it's a distraction and replacement for dealing with any actual issues.

""The Spirit Level"" makes a good case, agreeing with your hypothesis, that in more equal societies, recreational drug use tends to be less frequent - as you imply, it's associated with less poverty, less stress, less just-keeping-above-the-breadline, and so drug use has less of an appeal.

At the same time, I would argue that it hinders the social change we want to see - as a Brit, we have a reputation of being known as a bunch of shy, polite weaklings who are unable to stand up for ourselves, but if we want to see change in the world then we need to do something beyond simply ignoring the problem.

On that note:
&gt; The law often presents more barriers to safety than it should.

I would completely disagree - in most cases, the law understands which behaviours are detrimental to the population, and tries to limit them.

So now Portugal is in the quarterfinals. They will likely play either Winner of Group B or winner of Group D. That translates to either Spain, Chile, Italy or England. I think Portugal is favorites to win against the last 3, and against Spain it's actually not unheard of. In the last Euro Cup Spain played portugal and the match ended 0-0, Spain won on penalties.

Everyone talks about the big 4: Brazil, Spain, Germany and Argentina. But there are 2 other teams that everyone should be scared of: Portugal and France.

2.  Everyone in Derry has a gerbil.  Don't fuck the gerbil I see a lot of foreigners getting this bit wrong.
3.  No one in Derry can read, so you'll need to pretend or you're going to stand out

6.  We have this goat and its really small but we aren't sure if its a baby goat or some sort of midget goat.
7.  Shetland ponies are pretty dumb
8. Shetland ponies like to lick baby / midget goats.
9.  People in Derry don't believe in Saturdays.
11. Purple
12. Don't tell people you are Canadian, the only Canadian I ever met was an old woman who whined at me about potatoes.
13. Highland toffees and Abbey Crunch biccies are nice but I can't find them anywhere.

Edit; There's a wee fly under the glass of my monitor but it looks like its on the screen, its kinda weird I don't know how to get rid of it.  It's been there for 6 month's which is strange because I thought they only lived a few days.

Edit: What's the difference between a gerbil and a guinea pig?  Which one can you eat?

Edit: I've had an idea, if you are really worried you could hire my sister as a bodyguard.  She's 6ft has the appetite of a horse and is strong as an ox.  Imagine if Superman and Thor had a baby then that baby had a baby with a ogre and you're getting close.  I'll text her and see if she's interested.

Edit: Is the Hulk an ogre?

Edit: So my sister replied

            Me:  How would you like to be a bodyguard for a cute* foreign girl?
                 *Given that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

            Sister:  Who are you?

     
  I think I got the wrong number somehow, I'll double check and try again.

Edit: Actual sister this time

            Actual Sister:  If your smuggling in immigrants I want no part of it.  Anna (other sister) might be interested.

  So I can't get you a bodyguard but if you need anyone smuggled in you have 2 willing volunteers ready to help.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt; Some of the allure of drugs is the taboo, and addiction can stem from trying to hide your habit. Legalisation would take away the 'bad boy' image, and allow people to be open about their usage. Addicts won't often seek help because of the social stigma, so they self medicate and the addiction gets worse.

Legalisation of tobacco and alcohol certainly didn't decrease their use, to my knowledge - even now, it's only decreasing as a result of increasing legislation prohibiting its use in certain areas (unless, of course, it's *that* sort of legislation you propose instead of the current one).

Following that form of reasoning, the thrill of the taboo can be applied to other crimes for which a liberal approach isn't advocated - notably, first thing to come to mind, stealing, or truanting. If we were to adopt a soft approach to drug use, it would be inconsistent, and merely set up the potential for further campaigning.

Drug laws are made by politicians who not only are ignorant of research into minimising harms to a population, but in fact willfully go against expert advice they asked for if it doesn't suit their agenda. When prof. Nutt was asked to list drugs according to their harms to society and individuals, he was sacked and attempts were made to discredit his findings (admittedly Nutt was spoiling for a fight on this one, but the research was sound) The research indicated that either certain drugs, such as cannabis and mdma shouldn't be banned, or conversely that others, such as alcohol should be. Either way the law is wrong and that simple fact alone presents harms - the genuinely dangerous drugs are lumped in with those that only present minimal risks.

The other key point for me is that, while a good portion of drug use is for escapism, a lot is simply for the pleasure of it. If harms are minimised to the self and to others, I see nothing inherently wrong in seeking pleasure in a substance, it's morally neutral to me.

It's nice to see reason and thought on both sides of the drug debate though. Too often both sides are entrenched and reactionary, with very little substance to their arguments. Lots of confirmation bias and little appreciation of opposing views.

Sort of. But the prices are ridiculous because in most towns/cities, a group of men ready to beat the shit out of you and rob your house control the drugs. So we have to deal with the thugs, who realise they can raise the price extortionately and do so. Then they cut the weight even more and start adding harmful extras. We can't go elsewhere because those dealers have been strong-armed into buying stuff off the thug group.

All a bit much for someone who wants to come home and relax with a spliff instead a crate of beer, no?

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt; Would you feel confident using paracetamol if it were a gamble what dosage you were getting? What about if you weren't sure whether that alcoholic drink you were about to consume were 4% ABV or 20%?

In that circumstance, I would neither use paracetamol or alcohol, and especially not for recreational purposes. At the moment, I currently use neither anyway.

&gt; There are myriad ways of controlling supply. After all, there are many abuseable pharmaceuticals which do not carry charges for possession, but are still tightly controlled.

At the same time, these are drugs for medicinal rather than recreational purposes - true, medicinal drugs can be taken incorrectly and used recreationally, but as you say yourself, there are often controls in place to prevent this from happening (i.e. chemicals which induce vomiting on overdosage etc.).

&gt; I freely admit that the most difficult drugs to fit into any regulatory model are things like heroin, crack cocaine, and crystal meth. Abuse is the norm, and addiction prevents users making rational decisions about their use (this just in: most drug users, just like most alcohol drinkers, make rational decisions about their use). Making them legal to possess reduces harm at home. Making them illegal to supply might make them harder to get hold of, but make them more dangerous if people do, and will do nothing to help the plight of those in the third world who are daily terrorised by drug barons.

Rational Choice Theory is only one theory of the causes of drug use, but not one that I particularly dispute - as you suggest, yourself, addiction can lead to the making of irrational choices that appear rational in order to limit the stress of withdrawal etc.

In regards to a cost-benefit calculation on those drugs, there is little I can imagine being done to make these drugs ""safer"" or less dangerous, and on the case of it being allegedly beneficial in limiting Latin American drug barons, it also will lead to further deprivation of these countries - for example, Colombia would lose 3% of its annual GDP as a result etc.

&gt; However, most alcohol users are sensible and safe

Such a claim is certainly in contradiction to my own experiences.

&gt; I don't think anybody thinks that. Drugs are harmful, there is no doubt about it, whether regulated or prohibited. They are also, for most humans throughout all history, a part of life. That's why it's important to regulate. Regulation won't cure all drug harms, but it'll do a damn better job than prohibition.

So, once again, trying to develop a perfect world has been proven problematic due to money issues. Not that a ""perfect world"" would necessarily work due to the hedonic treadmill, of course, but y'know.

&gt; Why did you report these people to the police? The police only act on dealer tips not users, plus was it even affecting you?

I reported it because these people were breaking the law, even if it is a minor offence. If they aren't punished, it merely reinforces their perception of the behaviour as being without consequence. Which, ultimately, it was.

I reported then, if for no other reason, than because I was the only law-abiding citizen on these British Isles.

&gt; Caffeine and alcohol are both recreational drugs. Painkillers can be used recreationally, so you think we should make painkillers illegal?

I'm aware; I wish to ban the recreational use of drugs, but painkillers also have a medicinal use. I may not use painkillers myself, but I can appreciate people using them medicinally.

&gt; Does the potential of death stop people driving? How about exercising? No, of course it doesn't, there's the potential for death every time you leave the house, this reasoning is completely illogical and it is about what I would expect from someone with such a close-minded opinion.

There's a slight difference between the risk of a heart attack when exercising, and the risk of being hit by a car while running across the motorway.

true,dollarrichest,null,null,"&gt;Er, the type that doesn't want to have to step over shit and piss to get into their building. 

Just wanted to point out that people who are homeless tend not to piss and shit in the same spot where they sleep for pretty obvious reasons.

&gt;If these homeless don't want to be homeless they can toddle off to the council to get re-housed.

You can't decry homeless people as drug-addled psychotics and then in the same breath expect them to solve their problems as if it were just so. Of course many of them have mental issues and problems with drug abuse. The homeless are society's most vulnerable people and as such we should be trying to help them. And no, that does not mean people should invite them to sleep in their own thresholds. 

Boris Johnson has already decried these spikes as deplorable. Because they are. It's telling that the reaction on reddit has been so reactionary. Most here on this subreddit are more concerned about the property rights of the people who own the building than the lives of homeless people. Yes of course property owners have a right to do what they want on their own property, but that is not the reason the spikes have got people so riled up. You can't simply say ""it's their property, they can do what they like!"" as if that should be the end of it because society simply _does not work that way_. 

Look beyond the cold logical use of these spikes and see what they represent, which is nothing more than a big fuck-you to the aforementioned most vulnerable people in society. Of course the owners don't want them sleeping there, no more than anyone else would want homeless sleeping outside their doors. No one wants that. It's entirely obvious why they put the spikes where they did. The spikes are more contentious than other methods of discouraging homeless people (flower arrangements, benches with handrails between the seats etc) simply because they so unashamedly have no other purpose. 

Seriously, strip away the banal and utilitarian reasoning endlessly trotted out in all the discussions about this for placing the spikes and let's get down to the real meat of the problem. Which is that the owners have gone out of their way to make the lives of  the most vulnerable people in society harder. Drop the schtick about vagabonds ""shitting and pissing"" in people's doorways and ask yourself if that is really something you would want on your conscience.

To win back some of the public support, the very least the owners could do is make a very public donation to Shelter or one of the other homeless charities. It would go some ways to repairing the damage they've done to their reputations and cool the anger of those that vandalised their buildings.",0,1402602155,null,0,false,1,ci5xoc5,t3_27yk3d,t1_ci5xoc5,t1_ci5p0lc,null,1434210963,103,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,103

Oscar and Willian have got plenty of praise for their defending this season but they are reactionary defenders, chasing down the player or closing them down quickly. This does help turnover the ball regularly, but when they are passed through or behind, or lose the tackle, they are immediately out of the game. This doesn't harm us, however, because Matic is behind them. 

Matic reads the game to prevent the pass into the channel between the defence and midfield, where a good player can do damage. While Oscar/Willian react to the player, Matic is proactive and closes down the *space* that the opposition is looking to play the ball, forcing them to play a lower-percentage ball or go out wide or behind.

An ideal defence uses a combination of these players. Matic nullifies the easy forward pass be marking the player or contricting the space, while the opposition player in possession is closed or pressed by Oscar/Willian/Ramires, forcing a mistake and hopefully a counter attack.

The Judicial and Ceremonial stuff, such as observing the Sabbath and circumcision, is dispensed with as it applied only to the tribes of Israel, and even then only at that particular time.

Different churches disagree about what counts as what but they pretty much all agree on that.

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"My grandpa was a violent dad. He hated my uncle and would beat him constantly. My uncle ended up getting stabbed by his roommate in a heated argument. He beat my aunt - she grew up to be schizophrenic. He never hit my mum, for some reason she was his favourite. She nevertheless grew up to be terrified of violence. When she learned she was pregnant she immediately kicked her boyfriend out because she didn't want to take the risk that her child would be beaten by its father. She never hit me or my brother. Not once. If I was ever violent towards my brother she would overreact. One time my cat had kittens and my brother picked one up to play with it. My cat was begging for its baby back but he wouldn't give it, so I punched him in the chest. Had to live with my grandma for like 3 months after that.

My neighbourhood was a bit rough but not overly so. There were a couple of families everyone knew not to mess with, and one nutcase that you just avoided because he would beat you up as soon as look at you. Once my cat (different cat from previous story) had to be put down. When we got back from the vet I was still very emotional and the nutter's sister decided to come and taunt me as soon as I stepped out of the car. I headbutted her. My mum ended up having to go round to their house and apologise so he wouldn't hunt me down. Oddly he was very understanding.

I was in a few fights at high school. It was a posh school and I was the working class kid who got in on the assisted places scheme (thanks again Tony for getting rid of that, we had way too much social mobility back then) so I was usually the one who threw the first punch. My mum hated getting called in about that. Especially that one time where I beat up the teacher's son. Bitch shouldn't have asked me what I was going to do about it; he should have known he wouldn't like the answer.

So I had a pretty calm upbringing all in all. I feel pretty lucky when I hear about the shit some people had to put up with both inside and outside of their homes.",0,1402603267,null,0,false,0,ci5y96l,t3_27y6ts,t1_ci5y96l,t3_27y6ts,null,1434211239,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;__Caucasian race__ (also __Caucasoid__  or __Europid__ ) is the general physical type of some or all of the populations of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa), the [Horn of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa), [Western Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Asia), [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia) and [South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia).  The term was used in [biological anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_anthropology) for many people from these regions, without regard necessarily to [skin tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_tone).  First introduced in early [racial science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_race_concepts) and [anthropometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_anthropometry), the taxon has historically been used to denote one of the proposed major races of humankind.  Although its validity and utility is disputed by many anthropologists, *Caucasoid* as a biological classification remains in use,  particularly within the field of [forensic anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_anthropology).

Like it or not, right now the Middle East is NOT fit for democracy. It has a whole range of issues like post-colonialism, the discovery of oil which caused the formation of serf states that have no actual legitimacy, chronic radicalism from decades of funding from Saudi, Pakistan and Iran, tribalism between various groups, no real tradition of rule of law or democracy, Israel, etc. Nothing to do with race and everything to do with the political reality on the ground.

The Middle East isn't our problem to solve, because we can't solve it. They need to work things out over many decades. 

The thing the warnuts don't understand is that we don't have the capability to bring about peace and stability by just bombing and occupying countries. Our power isn't limitless, and our actions don't always help the countries we invade. The only winning move is not to play.

Iraq is falling because the politicians in Iraq have proved themselves completely incapable of getting ANYTHING done. The country is too factionalised and there is no political experience for the authorities to draw on, no revolutionaries and no inspiring figures. It has the military, it has the money and it has the weapons, yet their army stays home and doesn't fight the militants. There is simply no loyalty to the government.

I'm going to focus only on the Middle East here, not the wider Islamic world, since that's what I've studied. But from what I know, that statement is ridiculous for anyone with any knowledge at all of the last century of middle eastern history. I don't think you quite understand just how *new* Islamism is as an ideology. Sure you can trace in back sort of to the 19th century to people preaching in the streets that the fall of the Ottoman empire was because it wasn't Muslim enough, or to the Muslim brotherhood in the 1920s: but lets be real here political Islam only really became popular in the 70s-80s, so don't act like the only reason the middle eastern countries aren't declaring themselves the new Caliphate due to the innate political nature of Islam is because of Western backed dictators. Have you ever wondered why all those secular socialist dictators like Nasser were popular there is maybe because, you know, people there liked secular governments.

I've watched him at Barcelona since 2009 and he is the single best keeper I have ever seen in one-on-one situations. What I like about this is that his style of play is very different from Mignolet's which could give us tactical flexibility at the goalkeeper position which would give us an advantage other teams don't have. Additionally competition for the GK position is critical (ex. West Ham benched Jaaskelainen in favor of Adrian and ended up with 14 clean sheets and the 4th highest save percentage of any team in the league this season).

The biggest thing is we would never sign him if the finances didn't match his relevance to the team. We wouldn't pay him massive wages if he was going to compete with Mignolet, but as a free transfer he would be a great pickup.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;2 million people in the UK taking it every weekend

I'd like to see your source for that. From the information I have seen, the best estimate for MDMA use is that about 500,000 people have used it at least once in the past year, most of them not doing it every weekend. 

&gt;Hardly anybody dies from taking MDMA

About 50 people each year, but I'm not claiming its because the drug is particularly dangerous, its because people are foolish and do not take precautions when taking the drug. The same as with alcohol. If it was made legal, more people would take it and more people would abuse it and use it dangerously. Please explain to me why you think this is wrong.

&gt;Making them more informed and regulating the product might not stop all deaths but my prediction is that it would in fact drastically lower incidents of death particularly from MDMA.

There are over 10 million ""problem drinkers"" in the uk. That is people who exceed the recommended amount of alcohol on a weekly basis. That is 10 million people with all the facts and safety you are talking about. Do you really believe that if there were 10 million people taking MDMA in the same way, the number of deaths would actually decrease. You are going to have to explain that logic to me. 


&gt;Also your generalisations about MDMA users are just purely made up, citation again please?

You should take you own advice instead of using anecdotal evidence. Just because you don't drink doesn't mean everyone else is the same. (I wouldn't advice you to drink any alcohol at all while taking MDMA as it will dehydrate you very quickly). The fact is many people do drink alcohol wile on MDMA, just look around you next time you are at a rave.

Also, the fact that you take pills and are arguing about the safety of MDMA is quite funny. Its impossible to be sure what's in a pill unless you have your own testing lab. I hope you are getting them from a close source you can trust, as is he. 

&gt;Also, alcohol regulation HAS been sucessful.

9000 people die each your from alcohol consumption. You might call that successful but if 9000 people were dying from MDMA each year I would say there was a problem.

Even if all arrests ended in a court hearing, I think we both know there are more than 162,000 people in the country who use cannabis each year.

Lallana's performances have been WAY overhyped this season, he (and Shaw and Kompany) shouldn't have been in PFA TOTS to begin with, both Silva and Rooney were a lot better. Southampton didn't do well this season because of their offense, they did it through a strong defense earlier in the season +2 teams (spurs/united) having a bit of a melt down.

&gt;Lallana scored more

He scored 1 more goal, he also played 600 more minutes

&gt;made more assists

No he didn't, I think transfermarkt uses FPL assists, but they have Fabregas at 19 while Lallana has 8, the ""standard"" assist stat would still say 13 vs 6..

Also worth noting that Fabregas has the highest ""big chance created per 90 minutes"" in the top leagues with 0.98, Lallana has 0.15..

&gt;covered more ground, made more interceptions 

Um yeah, have you ever watched Barcelona play? How much do you need to run or how many interceptions do you need to make when you have the ball 70% of the time? There are two types of teams that have as few interceptions as barcelona, squads that sit deep or other possession dominant teams

&gt;Messi, Iniesta, Xavi and Sanchez

There is a reason that Fabregas is part of such a lineup, you are right that this does help his stats, but ignore a much more obvious truth

Fabregas is better now and has been better for a long period of time.

Moreno - Okay he's only 21 already capped 3 times by the world and euro champs but again only 2 years top flight experience(45games) although has played a huge part in a successful EL campaign

Lovren - now he's different He is proven quality. He's 24 has been a double winner in a shit Croatian league before being a squad player for a good team in the worst of the big 5 leagues for 3 years. He's also a seasoned international.
                    
I'm not saying Lallana and Moreno aren't class but both have only had 1 good season each, with Lallana you could argue 18months. To be proven you gotta do it for at least a few seasons. I get the price for Moreno as his quality and potential deserve a biggish fee, but npt Lallana. Fabregas is only 1 year and 6 days older and has been consistently good for 11 years.

If Cesc is worth a transfer fee of £27ish million then Lallana is worth £15mill tops.

true,LucasLeivaYNWA,lfc68,,"For me if they're both at their best, Pepe is the  better keeper. Over the past two seasons however De Gea has become more consistent and Pepe has had a drop in confidence. 

Reina is only 31 though, if he gets back on form, whether with us or someone else, he could have another 7-10 productive years. 
I actually think that if BR gave him a chance and let him fight for his spot, he could displace Mignolet (which probably scares Rodgers since he's quite fervent about playing 'his' guys).

One of Mignolet's often unmentioned weaknesses is his lack of communication with the back 4. Go back to the Crystal Palace highlights and look at Sakho's positioning on the goals. He drops back so deep. Mignolet should be screaming his head off. That wasn't the only time it's happened either. 

Everyone likes to talk about Reina's individual errors because naturally they will stand out more. But over the course of a season, far more goals are conceded because of poor communication and positioning of the back line. But Reina seldom got credit for his ability to organize because the adjustments are more subtle, the average fan doesn't notice them. I strongly feel that the Skrtel/Agger partnership suffered from his departure. But that was a digression. Mignolet is still young and he'll improve with time.

I play goalkeeper so I probably spend far too much time watching the keeper when I should be watching the action but there's so much that goes into playing the position and it drives me nuts when people (not you) say that Reina is shit. They just never noticed a lot of the subtle things that make him a fantastic keeper.

&gt; About 50 people each year, but I'm not claiming its because the drug is particularly dangerous, its because people are foolish and do not take precautions when taking the drug. The same as with alcohol. If it was made legal, more people would take it and more people would abuse it and use it dangerously. Please explain to me why you think this is wrong.

Because people who want to take it already do, the fact that it's illegal is really a secondary consideration for anybody who wants to do it. If it were legal you might expect use to actually decline like in Portugal.

&gt; There are over 10 million ""problem drinkers"" in the uk.

10 million problem drinkers? 1 in 6? I'd like to see your source on that.

&gt; You should take you own advice instead of using anecdotal evidence. Just because you don't drink doesn't mean everyone else is the same. (I wouldn't advice you to drink any alcohol at all while taking MDMA as it will dehydrate you very quickly). The fact is many people do drink alcohol wile on MDMA, just look around you next time you are at a rave.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the fact that you take pills and are arguing about the safety of MDMA is quite funny. Its impossible to be sure what's in a pill unless you have your own testing lab. I hope you are getting them from a close source you can trust, as is he. 

Yeah, I know all of that. I'd rather it was safer but you know it's illegal.

&gt; 9000 people die each your from alcohol consumption. You might call that successful but if 9000 people were dying from MDMA each year I would say there was a problem.

It used to be the old bus station, but over the last year local community members have come together to refurbish it into something absolutely wonderful. 

They serve locally produced booze - a selection of ales, vodkas, gin and they've started doing 'your bar' - where patrons are encouraged to make their own creations. (I believe the 'Smooth Hoperator beer is a favourite there)

The cafe in The Waiting Room is called Bobbys, and serves the best leaf teas in Colchester IMO, as well as cakes (including vegan and gluten free options) and have just started doing sandwiches. 

Wednesday nights at The Waiting Room is Maker Wednesday - we usually have either a speaker in to talk about something awesome that they do (gin making, pickled foods, letterpress, all kinds of things!) or there's Stitch&amp;Bitch, or you can just bring your own project to work on. 

Every second sunday of the month is board game night (usually from 3-9pm)

Thursdays and Fridays are usually music nights - either local bands that have booked the space, or DJs. I've seen quite a few indie bands here! Although my favourite right now is Fishclaw, a progressive folk band that is not a genre I was interested in but wow, they made me a fan. They've also started doing their pop-up street food nights on Fridays, tomorrow night is the Big Kahuna Diner food, with a DJ playing later on. 

Can you tell I spend a lot of time here? It's just so welcoming for creative types. I moved to Colchester last September, and this place has become my second home, and I've met so many amazing people there. (A few Canadians, among them!)

Maybe if the driver who knocked down this boy had had more experience reacting to bicycles and pedestrians, or if the roads didn't so easily allow cars to go at lethal speeds, or if the boy had been able to potter about on his bike not beside car-using roads, this wouldn't have happened. If the driver hadn't had to use a car at all, it definitely wouldn't have happened. But he did, because of the poor infrastructure.


So, the fact he was on his bicycle is a factor- he may not have died if he wasn't on it- and if he had a safer space on which to cycle, he may not have died either.

Hostility to the homeless does not mean preventing them from sleeping on your property. Your property is your property - by definition you have the right to do anything you want on your own land including putting up fences or walls around it. Vandalism of private property is never ever the answer. 

&gt;If I had a house, yes, I would turn part of it into a homeless shelter.

Which is your choice. Nobody can tell you not to but nobody can force you to either. Equally no-one can tell this Tesco Metro (AFAICT) to tolerate people camping on it's central London land it had to pay top dollar for - doesn't matter if their homeless or not. 

I say this as someone who regularly donates to Shelter and who is aware of the homeless problem especially in London. You talk as if property rights are secondary to someone elses needs - Communism is other words. Now Communism might be an operable system, we don't really know because it's never been tried in it's original form, but it's not the system we currently have and it's not the one British people want. You can't just say 'fuck your property rights' - I can't just travel to your home town and declare I need a place to sleep and I'm hungry to fuck your property rights, I'm going to camp in your garden and you'd better pay for some food for me. There's no obligation to surrender your private property to help someone else and there's no obligation to let homeless people sleep on your shop step.

Remember this fondly...(photo of Glasgow football team)

Well, that was a reminder of why I don't watch football much anymore. I just end up swearing at my TV.

MY FAVOURITE THING ABOUT THE FOOTBALL TONIGHT WAS SEEING THAT THING THAT ITV DO BEFORE THE ADVERTS

Bah football (article about a film) - no this was not me

Jesus. If there's ever an argument for match-fixing in the modern game...


Brazil. More hateful than Chelsea?

Thanks for wearing yellow Brazil... £20 up. P.s. That was bloody dull!

Ladies and gents. The tortoise called it.

lolatia

If only they had a decent lolkeeper

Bollocks. Just realised today was Thursday, not Friday. I blame the ref...

A different ref and this would be a 2-1 win to Croatia. :(

25 minutes still left in match 1 and up and down the nation livers are already starting to fail...https://twitter.com/TheMediaTweets/status/477142365640343552/photo/1

This referee :'D . Brazil have the likeability of Chelsea.

Brazil to win tonight. You heard it here first. (something about an animal)

Is there something important happening tonight?

That Carlos Alberto goal is absolute sex. Every single second of that move is sheer poetry on a pitch

When your neighbours include Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, qualifying for the World Cup is always likely to be an uphill battle. But of the ten active members of Conmebol, the South American Football Confederation, only one nation's team has never qualified http://econ.st/1lo4prR 

Anyone else want to help LIVE blog the World Cup opening ceremony?

Homemade Caipirinha and the World Cup. Here's to summer!!!

Didn't know that FIFA considers itself a nonprofit. A billion dollars is a lot of surplus revenue. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJEt2KU33I

I'm live now with a World Cup inspired all Brazilian music show on xx  with Music From A Sunny Place.

GET IN. croatia!

It's not the same without the vuvuzelas!

Drawing on the pitch. Feckin' vandals  ;)

Poor Cannavaro is finally having a World Cup nightmare, he doesn't know what's going on. Why would ITV sign up a guy that knows 2 sentences in English: 'this is the World Cup' and 'you have plan your performance'. The guy is getting by on his eyebrows alone.

New tattoo (football cup on face, fake obvs)

Said it before and I'll say it again: David Luiz is the most bafflingly overrated footballer on the planet...

World Cup might as well be in Portugal. Massive street parties going on.

Crivenny! Forgot how good the Gilles Peterson INCredible Sound CD was. World Cup Party in Chez (surname)!

Time to get pumped to this football classic! (some song)

AHAHAHAHA MARCELLO YOU FUCKNUT

Getting ready to cheer on Croatia later on!

Welcome to the world cup. J-Lo having a dance off with a clone of herself, whilst a badly dressed uncle has a slash on a wigwam. Extras from Avatar loiter in the background.

The World Cup opening ceremony sounds like it is being broadcast using a £10 Argos microphone.

This is showing how good the Olympics opening ceremony was.

Fuck me, that national anthem...

Worst episode of Blind Date ever. (picture of commentators)

Less than an hour to go! (picture of 'the world cup starts in 56 minutes')

Great memories of the last World Cup Final in Barcelona with the xxs!

During games where we have to be more defensively aware, Cesc would either be asked to ramp up his defensive duties and discipline, or be replaced by someone with more defensive fortitude like Ramires or Mikel, in which case the formation becomes a 4-2-3-1 again rather than the 4-3-3.

From GCHQ with love...

NEW documents from Edward Snowden published in the United States show how Britain's GCHQ has been involved in develop¬ing spyware that can take over an individual computer or mobile phone and spy on its owner.

While separate revelations from Vodafone last week that spooks and police have an active ""listening pipe"" into its communications were chilling, papers from the US National Security Agency reveal how Britain's eavesdroppers have moved on from intercepting outbound commun-ications to actively developing ""implants"" — pieces of malware which infect a targeted computer or phone and take anything from it the spying services want.

These implants then ""own"" the target's hardware and can read email, turn on a computer's microphone as a transportable bug or the webcam to take photos, as well as download huge amounts of data. Such widespread snooping could be done on millions of computers, according to the NSA, which describes it as ""aggressive"".

The implants infect a computer without the user's knowledge via spam email or by redirecting the user's browser to a fake Facebook server. The NSA documents revealed by Snowden show that GCHQ, via its listening station at Menwith Hill in Yorkshire (pictured), took the lead in ensuring that anyone who had visited Yahoo or Hotmail could be infected with an implant. The potential for such all-encompassing snooping prompted GCHQ to remark in a document dated April 2013 that its involvement in such practices ""may be in jeopardy due to British legal/policy restrictions"".

Meanwhile, a profitable industry has sprung up in the UK selling the same sorrohpying know-how pioneered at GCHQ — often to some very dubious regimes. Gamma TSE, for example, is a UK company owned by the mysterious and somewhat elusive Louthean John Nelson, a 53-year-old security consultant resident in Lebanon who does not appear on the UK electoral role, and Derek Alan Myers, a 53-year-old security consultant resident in Surrey. Their several businesses operate from their accountant's offices in Winchester.

It was a subsidiary of Gamma TSE, Finfisher Limited, owned by Nelson, that sold the FinSpy software which also uses implants to take control of computers and mobile phones, and which came to the UK government's attention in 2012. It is not known if the technology was a spin off from GCHQ; but business secretary Vince Cable told the company it needed a military export licence to sell its wares outside the EU. As a result Finfisher wound itself up in the UK, and Gamma opened a sales company in Switzerland.

A commercial offer for Finfisher spyware was found in the looted buildings of the Egyptian secret police before the revolution, at a cost of €333,607 for just two ""workstations"". An installation and commissioning document has also been found for Turkmenistan, a country whose former president ordered gold statues to be made of himself and who made North Korea look sane.

The only regulation the UK has of this complex area is via retired high court judge Sir Anthony May, who serves as the Interception of Communications Commissioner and occasionally tells police and security services to cut the number of wiretaps they use.

Think of a number..

NO SOONER had the last Eye gone to press than HM Revenue &amp; Customs put out a highly misleading report on its success in fighting tax dodging using methods that just last month [Eye 1366 had exposed as seriously flaky](http://www.reddit.com/r/PrivateEye/comments/26lpmq/eye_1366_in_the_back_pliant_compliance/).

HMRC claimed its efforts last year had scooped an extra £23.9bn from tax investigations, which the media swallowed hook, line and sinker. ""The government has raised a record £23.9bn in additional tax for the year to the end of March as a result of a crackdown on tax avoidance,"" reported the BBC online, while its broadcast outlets faithfully parroted the same line. Tax minister David Gauke (pictured) giddily tweeted a link: ""Here's the BBC story on HMRC's best ever year in securing revenue."" Alas, as he would have known, it was balls.

Since 2011/12 HMRC has reported not just the extra tax it has already brought in but also what it calls ""revenue protected"", which is future tax it hopes will be paid as a result of its intervention. Knowing that a breakdown of its numbers would wreck the story it was spinning, HMRC refused to tell the Eye how much of the £23.9bn was actually extra cash. The figures, it says, will be released ""in due course"", ie buried in its annual report during the summer recess.

But the small-print of another publication earlier this year, HMRC's ""mid-year report to parliament"", gives a clue. In the first six months of the last financial year, HMRC's ""compliance yield"" was £8.9bn, of which just £3.5bn, or 39 percent, was cash collected rather than revenue protected (or ""wishful thinking"" as one insider put it). At this rate, the idea that the authorities secured an extra £23.9bn tax last year from its investigations and checks would have been overstating things by, ahem, £14.6bn — or twice the international aid budget.

HMRC's announcement, in a press release and accompanying document called ""fast facts"" (surely ""fast and loose facts ""? Ed) contained another major porky. ""In total HMRC expects to secure £100bn from its compliance activities from May 2010 to March 2015, which is almost double the £52bn that was achieved between 2005-06 and 2009-10"", it claimed in words echoing a boast made by George Osborne in this year's budget alongside a chart showing rising income from investigations. While it admitted in small-print below the chart that ""the data series is not directly comparable"", it did not explain that the first number was based on a completely different measure — ""additional liability assessed"", ie excluding the wishful thinking, to the latter.

As for how HMRC inflates the figures with so much wishful thinking, information obtained by the Eye under freedom of information laws shows that it includes up to five years' hoped-for future extra tax payments in its ""revenue protected"" figures. No wonder it waits until the Eye goes to press before punting out the dodgy stats the rest of the media regurgitate unquestioningly.",0,1402640042,null,0,1402640227,0,ci6dk39,t3_2815v9,t1_ci6dk39,t3_2815v9,null,1434218581,2,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,2

Sahko cost 16 million and hopefully will show his worth next season. Skrtel has concentration issues, brilliant for 80 minutes but always a candidate to make an horrendous error. Agger is not favoured by BR, shown by his lack of game time last season. He reads the game well and is good on the ball but just not physical enough for the PL.

Communication and leadership at the back were issues all season although fault could also lie with the GK in this regard.

Maybe the manager sees 4 CBs as necessary given our increased games next season but with Kolo and Illori in the squad it looks like we will offload at least one of Skrtel / Agger.

Umm this isn't actually true.

The only times you can lose your job *for no reason* is:

* During or at the end of the probationary period you signed up for in the contract.
* At the end of the fixed term of a fixed term contract.
* If your employment contract *specifically states* that the agreement can be terminated by your employer for no reason (usually only applies to contractors for legal reasons).

If you're not in a probationary period and it's not the end of a fixed term contract you can't be ""fired"" for no reason and in ANY redundancy they cannot select you arbitrarily or for personal reasons. They need to be able, if asked, to demonstrate a methodology used to select individuals for non-optional redundancy.

Now, considering the OP's position it's likely they could simply reply ""last in, first out"" and that would shut that argument down entirely. However, say there was any evidence his manager hated him and discriminated against him, he could very easily argue at tribunal that this was the reason he was made redundant was due to discrimination.

It's quite easy to make someone redundant in any period under 12-24 months though, because it's easy to argue they were just the latest hire so therefore let go first. Likewise as long as they give the required notice they only need to pay like 1-2 month's pay max. 

I don't think there is anything the OP can do in this situation as it's extremely easy for them to justify his redundancy, however it's not true if you've been working somewhere for 18 months they can just let you go"" for no reason. Redundancy is easy to justify in lots of ways which is why it's used to get rid of people the company doesn't like, however that isn't time dependent.

However, skewing the market by having everyone else subsidise the renewables is wholly-retarded.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt;But the area is in use. It's in use by a private company who have set up a shop on land they own. Hostility to the homeless does not mean preventing them from sleeping on your property. Your property is your property - by definition you have the right to do anything you want on your own land including putting up fences or walls around it. Vandalism of private property is never ever the answer.

Essentially, in this circumstance, it has extended to ""You can't sleep outside because I want my yard to look pretty"". Needless to say, I'm surprised more people aren't angry at the trival excuse, and barbarism towards the offenders - if we're going to be using spikes, we may as well bring back a number of other barbaric methods, also.

&gt;Which is your choice. Nobody can tell you not to but nobody can force you to either. Equally no-one can tell this Tesco Metro (AFAICT) to tolerate people camping on it's central London land it had to pay top dollar for - doesn't matter if their homeless or not.

If no-one is using the car park because the supermarket is closed, it's a huge waste of space that could be better used for people who can't find any space to sleep, no matter how costly it was to rent the area.

Just because it's legal to have no regard for other poor people's basic functions and human rights (I.e. the right to shelter, and sll that) doesn't mean it's moral to do so, nor does it mean we should stand back and let it happen.

&gt;I say this as someone who regularly donates to Shelter and who is aware of the homeless problem especially in London. You talk as if property rights are secondary to someone elses needs - Communism is other words. Now Communism might be an operable system, we don't really know because it's never been tried in it's original form, but it's not the system we currently have and it's not the one British people want. You can't just say 'fuck your property rights' - I can't just travel to your home town and declare I need a place to sleep and I'm hungry to fuck your property rights, I'm going to camp in your garden and you'd better pay for some food for me. 

Insofar as statist Communism (a better word from me would probably be ""Socialists"", for whatever it's worth) is concerned, it involves the waiting of people to get in power in order to get any feasible change. 

Libertarian Marxists, Anarcho-Communists and the like are far more willing to bring about the change we want to see in the world through direct action, whether illegal or not, and whether it has the support of the masses or not. Thus, is why such so-called Autonomists are usually arrested for trying to make derelict, unused houses available for the homeless etc., or for their own use.

&gt;There's no obligation to surrender your private property to help someone else and there's no obligation to let homeless people sleep on your shop step.

Why would use decrease if it was made legal?

I don't agree with you on the assumption that everyone who would ever take it are already taking it. People do things that make them feel good, that make them happy, and MDMA does those things very well, for a while.

If MDMA was made legal, it would break down a big barrier for a lot of people. Think about how much people are mislead about the real harm of drugs. Do you not think that those scare stories prevent some people from taking them? If they thought the drug was safe many of them might try it.

What about the millions of people who haven't even heard of MDMA? If it was legalised wouldn't some of them be tempted? 

What about the children who look up to what adults are doing and try to mimic them? We already have a problem with youth drinking, and MDMA is arguably worse for their development. 

&gt;10 million problem drinkers? 1 in 6? I'd like to see your source on that.

There is some information [here ](http://www.alcohollearningcentre.org.uk/Topics/Browse/SocialMarketing/toolkit2010/introduction/IncreasingAndHigherRisk/)and [here](http://www.apho.org.uk/resource/item.aspx?RID=115659). 

&gt;Yeah, I know all of that. I'd rather it was safer but you know it's illegal.

There are safer ways to take it even when its illegal, such as not drinking alcohol with it and buying powder instead of pills. The fact that you don't really seem to care about minimising harm really proves my point that people need to be protected from their own mistakes. 

&gt;How many would die if it were illegal?

Well use falls when something is made illegal so I would expect deaths to fall as well. Maybe a couple more people might die from overdosing because of a bad batch of whisky, but the overall number of deaths would fall.

She didn't *know* it was a high dose. I mentioned this in /r/drugs, people take 0.5-1g regularly because they think that's normal. An actual strong dose is 150-200mg. If she had been aware that she was risking an overdose due to her body size and the strong dose, there's no chance she would have taken it. This isn't her fault and stop trying to blame her.

&gt;If you want to take a purely supply-and-demand monetary approach, there could just as easily be justifications for legalising child porn (another ""victimless crime"" when it regards merely the possession and watching of material), the selling of counterfeit art, probably even paid assassinations etc. - there are many untapped markets the state could involve itself in and profit from, but that doesn't mean that it should.


Legalising child porn would lead to people making more of it. Not only that, but it would be a huge disrepect to the people who were abused as children to make it, and cause a lot of emotional trauma to them if the government legalised it. Comparing the drug industry to other criminal activities like child porn and the assassination market is ridiculous because drug use is consensual, and currently the only reason people are harmed because of the drug industry is it's illegality.

The government could gain a *huge* amount of money from the drug industry. Just going with MDMA, the profit margins are insane. It costs less than £5 to synthesise a gram even if you're doing it on a small scale, and it's marked up to £40. And they wouldn't even need to drop the price: people are fine paying that much as it still only costs about the same as two pints to get a dose that will last a night. If the production was properly industrialised, it could easily cost less than £1 to make each gram, and the other £39 could be divided between regulation, taxes and profit. The government would mandate consistency in purity, spend part of the tax revenue on education and rehabilitation, and reduce the cost of policing the drug trade. 

It's hard to say how much the drug trade is worth, but looking at [NCA figures](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/crime-threats/drugs), policing it alone is £10B. If sold by the gram, £1.15B heroin and £1.5B cocaine are imported each year, and the cannabis market is worth £1B.  We're talking about saving tens of billions per year, while preventing unnecessary deaths like this one. It's hard to see why anyone would be against it.",0,1402650517,null,0,false,0,ci6fok3,t3_27yk10,t1_ci6fok3,t1_ci5v8h0,null,1434219646,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt;Legalising child porn would lead to people making more of it. Not only that, but it would be a huge disrepect to the people who were abused as children to make it, and cause a lot of emotional trauma to them if the government legalised it. Comparing the drug industry to other criminal activities like child porn and the assassination market is ridiculous because drug use is consensual, and currently the only reason people are harmed because of the drug industry is it's illegality.

Except for the fact that, in the case of addiction, drug use is no longer consensual - people will spend their money on the drug simply to avoid withdrawal, and often in greater amounts due to increasing resistance to the drug's effects.

With child porn as an example, the market already exists and the act of actually watching a video is fully consensual, even if the making of the videos are not. Thus, as the watching of a video is a harmless and consensual act, and the market exists, should it be illegal to watch and make, or just solely to make? After all, isn't the person who watches it a victim of their sexual desires, that they were born with?

Of course, many would then invert their logic, because child porn is a socially unacceptable act - they'll say ""You can't stop it by just tackling the supply, you need to tackle the demand, too!"". In other words, it's okay to arrest the innocent victim funding the system, as long as the issue is child porn rather than drug use (after all, drug use is clearly entirely victimless, and can gave no detrimental effect on the individual's social relations, bodily functions or mental wellbeing, can it?).

&gt;It's hard to say how much the drug trade is worth, but looking at [NCA figures](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/crime-threats/drugs), policing it alone is £10B. If sold by the gram, £1.15B heroin and £1.5B cocaine are imported each year, and the cannabis market is worth £1B.  We're talking about saving tens of billions per year, while preventing unnecessary deaths like this one. It's hard to see why anyone would be against it.

For a similar reason, as mentioned, why people are opposed to the use of legalising other black market commodities, or in using slavery or indentured labour to save money - it's morally dubious at best, and outright abhorrent at worst. Monetary gain isn't the sole factor that should be considered in *any* decision. ",0,1402651789,null,0,false,0,ci6fvtx,t3_27yk10,t1_ci6fvtx,t1_ci6fok3,null,1434219740,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And there in lies the problem, your opinions is most likely based on Government information and almost ALL of the information they release is either wrong, exaggerated or just straight up lies.

The reality now is that there are entire organizations that exist purely because of drug prohibition there's also massive militarized wings of police forces around the globe that would have no purpose (or justification) if there was no drugs.

On top of this, some drugs like Cannabis can easily out perform &amp; replace many very profitable drugs and in comparison is harmless &amp; extremely cheap (too cheap, which is most likelly the problem) . again money will be lost, that's pretty much the only valid reason for the current laws.

At the end of the day, Drug dealers don't ask for ID, they don't care if your 12 YO or mentally unstable, they only care about money (a lot like the people in charge to be fair)

Legalizing drugs would put them all out of business over night, why would you go to some shady guy &amp; buy fuck knows what when you could go to an official outlet and get exactly what you are looking for with no risks.

The ones in this article are in their late teens or early 20's and they're already established shithead rapists. Why do we let this happen? Clearly, if they are prepared to leave prison and return to crime, the system is not adequately punishing or rehabilitating them. If you have 10 previous convictions before you are 20, you clearly have no been punished enough.

In fact, the majority of crime in the UK is carried out by a small handful of people. Send them to jail for a few decades - preferably until they are too old to breed and pass on the alleles for being a cunt.

Let's start with a 20yr prison sentence for being a ""gang"" member. Add an extra 5 years for an offence carried out while being in a gang. That would sort it out much better than bouncing them in and out of the courts and soft punishments. And if there aren't enough spaces, build more prisons. I don't even mind paying a bit more tax if it meant we could cleanse the streets of these cunts.

If we got rid of these twats, crime in the UK would fall dramatically. ",1,1402652232,null,0,false,0,ci6fyb0,t3_281be9,t1_ci6fyb0,t3_281be9,null,1434219773,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

If everyone lived in blocks of 10 flats, 4 people to a flat, using the housing space that was available in 2008, we could house a total 200 million people (approximately the population of Brazil, the fifth-most-populated country on earth) - over three times the size of our current population, in the same space.

No-one said that, you seem have the impression that there's all these brown people running around the UK doing FGM. It's nasty little piece equivocation that culture warrior like to carry out. 

The inconsistency of which is demonstrated by your next comment:

&gt;Sexism exists everywhere

Indeed it does, which is why the inability to understand how societies and cultures work over time is even the more galling. If sexism and misogyny exist everywhere then it isn't specifically essential to any culture, thus there are other factors at play - such as history, identity formation, power, resource issues etc. 

This is where your analysis loses out because you seem to unable to factor those things. it starts with an assumption that ""Islamic"" culture which you euphemistically like to call ""migrant"" culture is essentially and inherently X. Where as a more intelligent approach would be to say that all cultures that are contested and societies go through various periods of adjustment. 

&gt;Wasn't there some paedophile ring in London that the Met weren't investigating because they'd be called racist?

and this demonstrates again your inability to do what I pointed out. If it's immigrant culture or race that's causing this than how does one explain the paedophilia and grooming carried out by the prominent stars of BBC light entertainment?

It's actually a pretty reasonable suggestion, I don't see what's ludicrous about it. 

&gt;What about the insane amount of people that die on the roads each year? Is it the governments job to to make driving illegal?

No but it its the governments job to protect people from making mistakes on the road. Which is why we have traffic laws, rules of the road, safety legislation and fines and tickets for making mistakes, as well as laws that can send you to prison for making a serious enough mistake. 
This has resulted in a general downward trend in the number of road casualties for the last [50 years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain#mediaviewer/File:Killed_on_British_Roads.png) 


&gt;While we're at it we may as well also make cigarettes and alcohol illegal too

Do you think cigarettes would pass safety regulations and be allowed to be sold if they were invented today and we knew the harm they could cause? 

&gt; it just allures to the fact that you've never taken it yourself. 

Don't be so sure, and taking MDMA doesn't make you an expert on the social effects legalising the drug would have. Yes it makes you happy and it feels nice, but so do a lot of harmful things. 

&gt;The people who want to do MDMA are already doing it,

If MDMA was made legal, it would break down a big barrier for a lot of people. Think about how much people are mislead about the real harm of drugs. Do you not think that those scare stories prevent some people from taking them? If they thought the drug was safe many of them might try it.
What about the millions of people who haven't even heard of MDMA? If it was legalised wouldn't some of them be tempted?
What about the children who look up to what adults are doing and try to mimic them? We already have a problem with youth drinking, and MDMA is arguably worse for their development.

&gt;it's not some 'playing with fire' kind of substance when you consider the ridiculous amount you have to take for it to be fatal when compared with what is a standard dose.

There are lots of ways to die from taking MDMA. If you are smart it is safe to take, but lots of people are not smart. People are cautious of an illegal drug. When you make it legal, people will be less cautious. 

&gt;MDMA is safe when done right, 

As is alcohol, but people still die from drinking too much of it. People still drink it every day. Try taking MDMA every day and see what effect it has on you. 

&gt;you are of the opinion that the government should have the right to tell me what I can and cannot out inside of my own body. 

Yes, we have laws are regulations on that, so that people don't poison themselves. The government looks out for peoples health. They even convinced coke to release a version of their drink with less [suger](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/11/coca-cola-fewer-calories-less-sugar). Is that the sort of unwanted interfering you are talking about?

&gt;Thankfully this is an opinion that is dying out with the older generations, because the younger generations that are now influencing our legal system are in ever-growing support of sensible drug legislation.

I am a part of that younger generation. I have experienced many different drugs, and I have had some wonderful experiences on them. But I have also considered the social impact they can have. I have seen vulnerable people, friends, have their lives destroyed by drugs, and I am not wiling to be a part of and decision that will cause more people to go down the same road as them. Vulnerable people will turn to whatever makes them happy for a while, and there are millions of vulnerable people in this country. 

You have a very one sided view of the debate. You think that everyone who doesn't want to see drugs legalised just doesn't understand them because they have never taken them, and if they did they would love them and understand. Well I have taken them, I continue to do so, I love the experiences I have on them, but I trust myself to use them in a safe and sensible way, as I trust myself to drink responsibly. There are thousands of people who ruin their lives with alcohol, and there are thousands who would ruin their lives if drugs were legalised. I think we should be protecting those people. 

&gt;the younger generations that are now influencing our legal system are in ever-growing support of sensible drug legislation.

If your idea of a sensible drug policy is to legalise all drugs without any consideration for how they would affect society then its not a sensible policy. I'm all for drug law reform, but the discussion on what would b a sensible solution for the problem is always drowned out by the call to legalise everything without any thought for the consequences, or worse ""We should legalise a long list of potent chemicals and plants, make them freely available to everyone, and ONLY good things can happen as a result of that.""

&gt;How would you even begin to explain away the success Portugal has had with it's approach on drugs? 

Portugal has decriminalised drugs, not make them legal. It just means you don't go to jail for possession. You can still be fined and have your drugs confiscated. It is still illegal to sell drugs. What success are you talking about? I don't really see how it is relevant.  ",0,1402652893,null,0,1402653109,0,ci6g1y4,t3_27yk10,t1_ci6g1y4,t1_ci6f75u,null,1434219821,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt; Some of the comments here are utterly disgusting - the homeless aren't animals, and they know better than to piss and shit themselves, no matter what the stereotypes may be. Not all people are born homeless, and we should quite frankly stop treating them like shit. If I had a house, yes, I would turn part of it into a homeless shelter.

Never before has a comment so reeked of teenage sheltered naivety. 

You ever worked with the homeless, son? I have. I volunteered at numerous homeless shelters for years. The rate of mental illness among the long-term homeless is shocking. The rate of hard drug addiction is shocking. Part of the reason why we worked to get as many into homeless shelters is *because* so many of them would leave doorways in such a mess (shit, piss, needles, pipes, burnt spoons etc), that it feeds the anti-homeless sentiment among the public.

For a lot of the long-term homeless, you could give them a house, full of furnishings, for *free*, and within a month the goods would have been sold to buy gear, and the house would be a den for users. Too many of them value their addictions above anything else. Often, they'd take their panhandling money, buy some gear, and come ask us for food because they're hungry. We'd provide, because they'd starve otherwise, but it's astonishing to see them willingly go hungry in order to get some gear.

You want to open your own *home* to the long-term homeless? You *will* find anything of value stolen. You will find your food stolen. You will be threatened physically. Addiction combined with mental illness is a frightening thing to see. Go volunteer at a homeless shelter if you really want to help, and as an adult, there's nothing stopping you. You'll be doing some *actual* good, while seeing the reality of homelessness. For a lot of the long term homeless, they will never be ""off the streets"". It's an inescapable fact.

Until then, stop putting your fingers in your ears. You don't understand a fraction of a percent what the situation around homelessness is like.",0,1402652921,null,0,false,0,ci6g23q,t3_27yk3d,t1_ci6g23q,t1_ci60oyk,null,1434219824,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mayniac182,cnty-england,London,"&gt;Except for the fact that, in the case of addiction, drug use is no longer consensual - people will spend their money on the drug simply to avoid withdrawal, and often in greater amounts due to increasing resistance to the drug's effects.

By all legal definitions, it's still consensual. Nobody forces anyone to take a drug (except for spiking), and nobody forces anyone to continue using a drug. It's entirely the addicts choice to take the drug the first time, and entirely the dealer's choice to sell to that person.

&gt;With child porn as an example, the market already exists and the act of actually watching a video is fully consensual, even if the making of the videos are not. Thus, as the watching of a video is a harmless and consensual act, and the market exists, should it be illegal to watch and make, or just solely to make? After all, isn't the person who watches it a victim of their sexual desires, that they were born with?


Possession, supply and creation carry different sentences. If you take the rights of the person in the video out of the equation then sure, I could agree with you. But you can't legalise something that has (and may further) caused psychological trauma to someone. Legalising child porn would not only be an insult to the victims but it would make it far easier for the illegal market to expand and create more victims. You're comparing legalising something that would help prevent deaths and reduce other forms of crime to legalising something that would encourage people to fuck kids. That's a seriously bad comparison in every regard.

&gt;Of course, many would then invert their logic, because child porn is a socially unacceptable act - they'll say ""You can't stop it by just tackling the supply, you need to tackle the demand, too!"". In other words, it's okay to arrest the innocent victim funding the system, as long as the issue is child porn rather than drug use (after all, drug use is clearly entirely victimless, and can gave no detrimental effect on the individual's social relations, bodily functions or mental wellbeing, can it?).

Again, it's ridiculous to compare the two. Someone funding the child porn industry is funding an industry which abuses children. It's abhorrent. Nobody in their right mind would agree to the government taking over that industry. Someone funding the drug industry, however, doesn't know where the fucking money is going. It could be going to a cartel in Mexico, Al Qaeda, or a harmless middle aged man who happens to grow weed in his greenhouse. The government can change that by legalising and regulating the market themselves, but by choice haven't done so. I would personally love to know where the money I spend on drugs goes: I hate the thought that without knowing it, I may have funded a London gang that does worse than drug dealing. But I don't. People watching child porn know that any money they give is going to people who abuse children, which is why possession is illegal. 

&gt;For a similar reason, as mentioned, why people are opposed to the use of legalising other black market commodities, or in using slavery or indentured labour to save money - it's morally dubious at best, and outright abhorrent at worst. Monetary gain isn't the sole factor that should be considered in any decision.

I've said this before, we'd be regulating the market and saving lives because of it. 

Imagine if alcohol had no taste. You could drink a shot of tequila or a shot of beer and not know the difference between the two. Now imagine that you go to a pub where when you ask for a drink, you have absolutely no idea how strong it is. It could be 10%, could be 40%. You have no way of knowing. Of course even someone who's sensible and cautious could easily hurt themselves. By lack of action by the government, this is basically what they're enabling. The alcohol industry kills far more people and has a far worse impact on society than drugs, yet it is legal and regulated by the government. Problems with drug use won't magically sort themselves out with legalisation, but it would make it far easier for the government to control.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt;You ever worked with the homeless, son? I have. I volunteered at numerous homeless shelters for years. The rate of mental illness among the long-term homeless is shocking. The rate of hard drug addiction is shocking. Part of the reason why we worked to get as many into homeless shelters is *because* so many of them would leave doorways in such a mess (shit, piss, needles, pipes, burnt spoons etc), that it feeds the anti-homeless sentiment among the public.

I am basing my opinions on my experiences. I've met and befriended numerous homeless people - former associates who have since lost their accommodation for one reason or another - and, out of these people, few of them are drug users, and none of them have (to my knowledge) shit or pissed inappropriately. I've seen many of my drunken friends act worse when it comes to pissing and shitting in public.

I have never volunteered at a homeless shelter (although I have volunteered at youth groups with homeless youths), but I base my interpretation of the homeless based upon the homeless individuals I've experienced.

EDIT: And, because I feel I wasn't anywhere near as demeaning enough as you were towards me:

&gt;Never before has a comment so reeked of teenage sheltered naivety. 

Never before have *I* seen a comment reeking of elderly disenchantedness and embittered cynicism towards the world.

You seem to be a man who has spent so long working with the disenfranchised, that you have dehumanised them, and are likely a conservative man who believes that if they just didn't piss and shit themselves then they would be rich and famous in our so-called ""meritocratic"" society. That, back in your day, the homeless were morally superior because they were harder working. I got that impression, of a man on his high-horse, from your writing.

Needless to say, if you do hold such a view and I have characterised you correctly, you are the naive one - the vast bulk of academic opinion points to the opposite conclusion.",0,1402654493,null,0,1402660711,0,ci6gaxm,t3_27yk3d,t1_ci6gaxm,t1_ci6g23q,null,1434219938,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

He wanted Iran to believe that his weapons programme was much more advanced than it was. He was playing a juggling act with the West and Iran, wanting the West to think he had nothing to hide but Iran to think he was hiding WMD. The West's intelligence services recognised that it looked as if he was trying to hide WMD and this led to UN resolution 1441. Saddam Hussein realised then that he had gone too far and increased cooperation with inspectors but by then it was too late.

I never said that; I did say that if there's certainly cause to be alarmed about FGM actually happening in the UK. Again, refer to the other bloke's comment - if France are worried about their citizens going across the Channel for FGM, then it is, certainly, something to think about.

Also, for what it's worth, I'm brown.

&gt;Where as a more intelligent approach would be to say that all cultures that are contested and societies go through various periods of adjustment

There is no reason immigrant societies should be given time and place to adjust when the 'adjustments' involve eliminating archaic practices. Moreover, given how long immigration to the UK has been going on, you'd expect some progress by now. 

And there are degrees of sexism. Read the article: teachers having to turn the other way when 13-year-old girls are taken away for marriage? I don't think that compares to first-world sexism.

All cultures are, unfortunately, inherently sexist - the difference is that ethnic Britons are called out on their regressiveness, while immigrants are not. And no, I'm not ""euphemistically calling Islamic culture migrant culture"" - the problem is widespread amongst several cultures, but the scope of the article, here, is Islamic culture.

&gt; immigrant culture or race that's causing this

You are, again, completely misunderstanding me - I am *not* saying that the paedophilia rings or what not are a result of immigrant culture or race, but that the political correctness and hypersensitivity in *dealing* with such problems is a problem in itself. It is a *British* problem, not an immigrant problem.

My own country suffers from a similar (albeit far stronger) problem - excessive political correctness and ""respect for other cultures"" make polygamy legal for Muslims, as well as laws that allow Muslim men to not pay alimony, and not require a formal divorce.

He fails to mention the pre-existing Sunni/Shi'ite tensions in Iraq, the violent suppression of the majority Shi'ite population by Saddam after the Iranian revolution, the funding of Shi'ite sectarian groups by Iran after the coalition invasion, or the impact extremist militant Sunni groups in Syria which blossomed after the Arab spring.

Undoubtedly the coalition has made the situation worse, however it did not create the Islamic sectarian issues in the region, nor would stopping the war have made the current crisis less inevitable; Saddam would have died or fallen to his own people eventually, or possibly during the Arab spring the country would have developed into a brutal civil war like Syria.

W&gt;Let's start with a 20yr prison sentence for being a ""gang"" member. Add an extra 5 years for an offence carried out while being in a gang. That would sort it out much better than bouncing them in and out of the courts and soft punishments. And if there aren't enough spaces, build more prisons. I don't even mind paying a bit more tax if it meant we could cleanse the streets of these cunts.

You fail to define how you will identify a 'gang' member. and locking people up is expensive I think our gov pays bout 40k a year per prisoner. 

And also when 'gang' members go to prison they get the chance to network with other criminals and learn new 'skills'

He was a student of recent history, Korea, French Indochina, American Vietnam war.  He knew full well the difficulty you have imposing external values on a population that frankly doesn't really give two shits, they just want a little bit of a better life.

Given his piratical experience in dessert warfare, he surmised that it would come down to a dirty fight inside the population centres.  With constant issues keeping supply lines open and efficient.

He was very vocal about this in 2003.  He supported the idea of ousting Sadam, but I recall him saying that you'd need at least 2 million troops to do it well.  Being a good solider, he knows that you don't choose to go to battle, when you won't win.  So he did oppose the invasion.  Furthermore he never liked the idea of Soldiers being a paramilitary police force.  His experiences in a bomb squad in NI hardened that I think. You mustn't let the squaddies be police.

It is worth noting, that this strategy was used a little at first.  Our troops patrolled as much as they could their civilian areas on foot, wearing berets not battle helmets, giving out footballs and chocolate to kids.  But you can only have martial law with that relaxed attitude if you've got the sufficient numbers, we didn't, our boys started getting hurt, so we switched to the more defended strategies.  Hell when we were withdrawing, I remember reading how a US General was in-acting French Indochina style Watch Towers, with roaming patrols, I just thought all those years and they can't even secure a supply route well enough for just an armed convoy!

The fact is that no one can predict the future in the long term, or even the medium term. Demand outstrips supply because people are buying to rent or to make a profit. If you lower house prices, more people can buy, less people have to rent, and less people buy houses to make a profit. This means that there are more houses on the market.

&gt;

&gt;On 19 April, four days after the disaster, [Kelvin MacKenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie), editor of *[The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom\))*, a British [red-top tabloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format\)#Red_top_tabloids) newspaper with national distribution owned by [Rupert Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch), used ""THE TRUTH"" as the front page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: ""Some fans picked pockets of victims"", ""Some fans urinated on the brave cops"" and ""Some fans beat up [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable) giving [kiss of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_respiration)"".

&gt;The newspaper cited the words of unnamed police officers and [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick for information relating to the alleged incidents.   *The Daily Express* also carried Patnick's version, under the headline ""Police Accuse Drunken Fans"" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the ""mayhem caused by drunks"" and that policemen told him they were ""hampered, harassed, punched and kicked"". 

&gt;The story accompanying the *Sun* headlines claimed ""drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims"" and ""police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon"". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a dead girl had been ""abused"", and that Liverpool fans were ""openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead"".  These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims and gave first aid to many of the injured.

Let's say there was a gigantic house-building drive in this country. The problem is that those who could afford a house before this event would see their house price value plumment, would be massively unfairly hit and potentially lose their homes. The destruction of livelihoods, families and homes would be massive. 

Some people may think ""well you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelette"" (usually those people are the ones who stand to gain the most from it - the ""poor"" can be just as greedy as the less poor, medium wealth or wealthy) and the people who would suffer would not be the rich ones, they'd be the people/families on the borderline. 

So, in the ""poor's"" efforts to improve their own chances at home-ownership, they manage to completely fuck over a proportion of the population who are innocent of any wrongdoing, have worked to get where they are and are now screwed beyond repair, even worse than those who couldn't afford a house to begin with.

&gt;&gt;you want to argue against the GMC

&gt;Why not?

You've just been building your argument using the GMC.   

A couple of links about where the GMC stand and you start attacking them, but in doing so attacking you own previous argument!

&gt;From your personal point of view, which obviously can't agree to me as then you would be at fault and you are Mr Perfect, who is always right.

It's your own comments that you're now arguing with.   

Of course I've also got and linked the Royal College of Surgeons and Practitioners backing up what I've claimed, the NHS regulatory body, the GMC, and a speech provided by an NHS professor in oncology.

&gt;I haven't admitted that there are definitely lower standards in any EU countries in relation to level of teaching at medical universities.

Are you saying now that you don't think there are different levels of training in different EU countries?

Remember medical universities have medical wards, and we have real term data about the level of results places deliver.

&gt;And if they think that such is real, they can scream,push or whatever the EU towards making sure that those standards do exist.

It took them 30 years just to be able to test language competence legally.  Even with screaming for a minimum standard it will have to be a minimum standard that all 28 countries will be able to meet, many of which are much, much poorer,  So an EU standard still lowers the bar for the more developed systems.

&gt;Remember when Farage said current guns ban is stupid as it was based on panic, rather than actual data research (which could prove whether the ban in fact changes anything in number of gun-related crimes)? It's very similar with the above discussion - but don't get me wrong, I'm assuming things, I haven't looked at details myself

Yeah, you probably shouldn't assume anything because you already appear to have a weak handle on what was proposed - and it is unconnected.

These include dismissals for reasons such as pregnancy or maternity leave, trades union membership, whistleblowing, reporting health and safety risks or assertion of statutory rights

So while your employer doesn't have to *supply* you with a reason, if you were later able to prove that reason was linked to discrimination or other issues you could take them to a tribunal. 

You could argue that ""no reason whatsoever"" doesn't include discrimination, but then I'd argue there's no such thing as ""being let go for no reason"" as everyone has a reason for doing it.

In fact one of the main argument was that by doing this we'd risked having to engage in long term occupation to prop up and enforce a state the people of that state might not even want.

Equally, however, if you chug pints of water every five minutes then you can over-hydrate and suffer [water intoxication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication), which can also be dangerous.

As with everything else the answer is moderation - *sip* a bottle or pint of water every *hour* or so, and make sure you know the risks and are aware how to act to ameliorate them.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;What's to repeat? You replied to a 'could', you said you thought you were talking about 'would', and then said that we totally could do what I'd said.

I've told you me view on that. Your COULD was not supported by any explanation, hence I had full right to react like that as I can't PREDICT what you possibly have in mind and how that could be achieved, not saying about consequences. It's idiotic something can be done, without taking into account possible negative consequences, which you didn't bother to mention at first (nor even later and just refused them as not existing).

&gt;You've just been building your argument using the GMC.

It doesn't matter, I attack arguments which I think are idiotic and I don't care whether they come from you or from organisation.

&gt;Of course I've also got and linked the Royal College of Surgeons and Practitioners backing up what I've claimed, the NHS regulatory body, the GMC, and a speech provided by an NHS professor in oncology.

So? Again, look above.

&gt;Are you saying now that you don't think there are different levels of training in different EU countries?

I don't have any data on that so can't confirm nor deny. Nor does you or the GMC (they are afraid because they think those might not be good enough, not because they have facts).

&gt;It took them 30 years just to be able to test language competence legally.

It seems you have missed my quote from the article which said it was ""GMC's interpretation"", not that the EU forbid them doing so. Maybe GMC was so rubbish they couldn't interpret it in correct way for such a long time?

I also think that test is unnecessary as it is supposed to be employer's responsibility to check language level of applicant, not the GMC, especially that some doctors may require higher, while others lower standards of knowledge of that language, not saying about some specific clinics treating mainly certain nationalities only.

&gt;Even with screaming for a minimum standard it will have to be a minimum standard that all 28 countries will be able to meet, many of which are much, much poorer, So an EU standard still lowers the bar for the more developed systems.

You again seem to miss the difference between ""education standards"" to ""general standard of offered services"". In fact, education standards can very truly be higher in poorer countries, due to number of reasons. For example in Poland higher education is free but you have to have good grades in order to get a free place (something UK should do with their higher education system in my opinion). That is why, migrants from Eastern Europe are on average more highly educated than Brits! Of course you can claim that the standards were lower.... but again, it's not such easy to confirm, nor deny it, although I've given you few examples relating to lower education levels.

&gt;and it is unconnected.

India/Pakistan, when a united country, were heading for a religion fueled civil war on a grand scale because of the millennia old hatred between the Hindus and Muslims.

The British were trying to sort it out. The British found that the quickest and least damaging option was to split the nation so as to keep the muslims and hindus apart.

Britain did not intend for those countries to fight. What those countries did after independence cannot be blamed on anyone but themselves.

The whole thing is far more complex that you think it is. There were dozens of factors as to why India got split up.

As for Ireland, it got split because the Protestant Irish wanted to stay a part of Britain and the Catholics didn't. Both the Irish and the British decided on creating a enclave in the north of the island where the protestants could live as part of the UK. *The Irish agreed to this*.

It was catholic Irish nutters who founded the IRA who wanted to try and force a population in an area of which the vast majority were pro British to join a nation in which they would most likely have been persecuted because of their protestant religion.",0,1402663043,null,0,false,0,ci6i09y,t3_281cwx,t1_ci6i09y,t1_ci6hk5s,null,1434220741,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The facts:

Palestine:

Yes, the British tried to create a Jewish state in Palestine, however the British saw it was a bad idea and tried to bring the Jews back to Britain.

The Jews did not want to leave, thus leading to the Jewish Insurrection in the late 40's/early 50's.

The US stepped in and took over, forcing through the creation of a Jewish state which led to the problems we see today and the problems we saw throughout the 20th century. Blame the US, not Britain.

*

As for India, the borders had nothing to do with it. Without partition, India would have fallen into a catastrophic civil war that would have made WW2 look like a freaking picnic.

The millennia long hatred between the Muslims and the Hindus was reaching boiling point, mainly thanks to rhetoric from a number of prominent Indian leaders, including Gandhi (who was anti-muslim). Couple that with tensions elsewhere about everything from language (there was not officially recognised common language) to resources to water rights to the rights of the Indian states and princes etc etc and things were getting more and more funky.

Had the British not stepped in, sorted as many of the minor problems as they could (they did, including proposing English as the common language, which got rid of *some* tension) and partitioned India (which was seen by the British *and many Indians* as the least damaging and quickest solution to the problem), then tens of millions would have died in a religion and ethnicity fueled civil war.

After partition, there was still a lot of tension, which led to the violence (and the subsequent wars and civil war in Pakistan). Over ten million people died. One fifth of the number of people who died in WW2 died after partition. Yes, it was a crisis, but it would have been at least ten times that number had India fallen into the civil war it was heading for.

And the hatred between Muslims and Hindus would have led to something far more atrocious than even the holocaust...... 

So, yes, India worked out as best as it could under the circumstances. Don't delude yourself by thinking without partition there would have been peace.

I do this every day, and I'm willing to bet you do too. Every time I walk past somebody on the streets without emptying my wallet, every time I politely decline to give somebody my change.

I can't really help people who are homeless - I don't have the skills or the resources. I can acknowledge that it's often very sad, and certainly I agree it's a shame that some are so needy they end up sleeping rough.

I'm in the position (and I maintain the huge majority of other people are too) of saying ""Yes, it's sad and in an ideal world people wouldn't be in that position"" on the one hand and ""But if they are, then I don't want them to interact with me regularly, because sadly those interactions will (almost always) be negative"".

What got my back up slightly was the cognitive dissonance of the vandals who are prepared to dictate what people can and can't do to prevent people sleeping rough outside their front door, without actually stopping to consider if they've done everything they can to remove the need for such devices, or indeed stop to think about what they'd do if it was their front doorstep that people were sleeping rough on!

You know it's apologetic shit like this that makes my blood boil.

Here, you dumb fuck, take a look at what Saddam did to HIS OWN PEOPLE during his reign.

*Approaching two million, including between 150,000 and 340,000 Iraqi and between 450,000 and 730,000 Iranian combatants killed during the Iran-Iraq War. An estimated 1,000 Kuwaiti nationals killed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. No conclusive figures for the number of Iraqis killed during the Gulf War, with estimates varying from as few as 1,500 to as many as 200,000. Over 100,000 Kurds killed or ""disappeared"". No reliable figures for the number of Iraqi dissidents and Shia Muslims killed during Saddam's reign, though estimates put the figure between 60,000 and 150,000. (Mass graves discovered following the US occupation of Iraq in 2003 suggest that the total combined figure for Kurds, Shias and dissidents killed could be as high as 300,000). Approximately 500,000 Iraqi children dead because of international trade sanctions introduced following the Gulf War.*

Are you suggesting Iraq and the neighboring countries would have been better off if we'd left things as they were?

The WMD excuse was so much bullshit, but that guy needed taking out anyway. No one else was stepping up (unlike Libya where the UN were falling over themselves to take out Gaddhafi).

War involves death, live with it. It's a hell of a lot LESS death than if we'd left the status quo as it was.

Any intervention should be legal, ethical and practical. Iraq was ethical but neither legal or practical.

Legal we get to define what it means but that doesn't mean anything is legal. The UNSC is broken and we need a consensus among willing partners (and I'd include Germany and France in that) about what an appropriate mechanism for legitimacy is. Unilateral action is not to be accepted.

As for practical. All wars should be started with an end goal in mind. If that is regime change then precisely what the new regime is should be defined. Note ""defining the new regime"" could be an essay all of its own. At the very least we would need to understand where a new regime gets its legitimacy from, how it secures itself, how it runs the operations of the state, etc.

Just saying ""throw it open to the voters"" isn't workable. No nation has worked like that. The US had the continental congress and continental army as a power block long before it had democracy. In fact the continental congress (more or less) later unilaterally overthrew the constitution of the US and then wrote and imposed a new one (more or less). However they had the legitimacy and actual infrastructure, resources and network to pull it off.",0,1402664501,null,0,false,0,ci6if6c,t3_281cwx,t1_ci6if6c,t1_ci6fsd2,null,1434220936,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

* Unwaxed limes, or lemons at a pinch, the zesty, thin skinned kind.    
* Ice from the freezer not the fridge - important!

Add plenty of tonic water, taking a moment to relish the hiss and crackle of the bubbles escaping.    
Drink that delicious bitch, whilst listening to the music of the ice cubes tinkling against the glass.    
Cleanse your palate with a couple of slices of the gin-infused citrus, including the bitter skin.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; Or maybe they won't be more funding put towards the NHS because it keeps getting it's budget cut.

*When the NHS was launched in 1948 it had a budget of £437million (roughly £9billion at today’s value). In 2008/9 it received over 10 times that amount (more than £100billion).*

*This equates to an average rise in spending over the full 60-year period of about 4% a year once inflation has been taken into account. However, in recent years investment levels have been double that to fund a major modernisation programme.*

*Some 60% of the NHS budget is used to pay staff. A further 20% pays for drugs and other supplies, with the remaining 20% split between buildings, equipment and training costs on the one hand and medical equipment, catering and cleaning on the other. Nearly 80% of the total budget is distributed by local trusts in line with the particular health priorities in their areas.*

*The total budget of Department of Health in England in 2008/9 was £94bn of which NHS England accounted for £92.5bn. The National Audit Office reports annually on the summarised consolidated accounts of the NHS. In 2012 the NHS budget was set at £104 Billion, or £3000 per second.*

I'm not sure where you get the idea their budget is being cut. It may be being reallocated or restructured as to where it goes, but for sure it's costing us more and more each year (over the rate of inflation).",1,1402665428,null,0,false,0,ci6ipfy,t3_281lwz,t1_ci6ipfy,t1_ci6ii0s,null,1434221070,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
